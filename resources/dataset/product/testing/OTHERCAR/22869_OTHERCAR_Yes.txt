            My wife and compiled a list of features we wanted and needed in our next truck. After looking closely at the available models we selected the Chevy/GMC 2500 HD SLT crew cab long bed 4x4. We spent some time going over the trim levels option packages and knew exactly what we wanted. When the '03 model year started I called the eight Chevy and GM dealerships within 75 miles of us and asked for a quote on our specifications. Being the start of the model year I wasn't really surprised the best bid was for $900 over the Edmunds invoice price from a GMC dealer. So we gave the dealer a down payment and four weeks later our truck was on the lot ready for pickup. We did get delivery in time for the $1000 rebate GM offered then. But if I had any inkling about the $3000 rebates and lower interest rates I could have gotten later in the model year I would have waited.

I have 26k miles so far and have had to problems. The first issue appeared on the second day, the passenger side power mirror stopped moving. Replacing that mirror solved the problem. The second issue didn't appear until December. If the outside temperature got below freezing the engine would sometimes start very roughly and the DIC displayed the message reduced power mode. After running for ten to fifteen minutes I could restart the engine and everything would be fine. The computer codes reported a problem with the throttle body, which the dealer replaced.

Despite this monster's size I find it handles very well. The acceleration and stopping distances are also good for a vehicle of this size. Both the front and back seats have plenty of space, and the leather seats are very comfortable. I really like the DIC and the customizations it allows me to set. But the most important comfort feature has to be the dual climate control. Like many couples we differ greatly on out temperature preferences, and this little feature keeps me from feeling guilty that she has to wear a sweater in July when I'm driving.

The stock tires are really too small, my chest scrapes the frame when I slide under it for an oil change. I think something like 255/85R16 is more appropriate.  My biggest complaint is the onstar system. Cell phone coverage is very poor where we live, and non-existent at many places we go, making onstar completely useless for us. But even if it wasn't I do not like the concept that my truck can be monitored whenever I'm in range of a cell tower. It&#146s annoying that we had to pay for the integrated onstar GPS, but get no use from it.

I looked very closely at the diesel option, but couldn't justify the $5k price tag. At $3k we probably would have gotten it though. The additional mpg and with that the additional range would have been nice. But the long bed does come with a 35 gallon tank, and I do get 14.6 highway without a trailer so I can do about 500 miles between tanks. My combined highway city mileage is 13.4, which is very good for a truck of this size. 

On my last truck I had a pop in bed liner, but on this one I decided to try a sprayed on type. I'm glad I did; besides looking better items don't slide around and it is very durable. I got a Rhino lining, but a friend (who also has a 2500 HD) opted for the Line X brand. They are both doing well and costs were almost identical.
