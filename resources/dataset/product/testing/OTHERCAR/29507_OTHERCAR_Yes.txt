            The Kodak DC240 is a great starting off camera for anyone who wants to do away with the whole film developing process.  The camera is small, durable, has a small viewscreen on the back to let you see what your actually going to get in the picture.  This camera uses memory cards which can be pricy, but are much smaller and hold much more than a floppy disk.  The camera comes equipped with almost every kind of adapter to get you hooked up to any PC/MAC anywhere.  The pictures are very clear on the best setting, and pretty decent on the medium setting.  Yes, the camera lets you choose the quality of your photos.  If you have a rather large memory card it would be in your best interest to put it on the best setting.  if you have a small memory card, you would want to put it on the low quality setting.  Anyone can benefit from this camera that wants too, and you can even take your memory card to a photo retailer to get them printed in a matter of minutes.  I chose this camera because it was a definate buy for its price range.  you cant find many cameras of its caliber in the 600 dollar price range.  Accesories with this product that i would recomend purchasing would be a rechargable battery pack or two(it goes through them really really fast) and definently a bag to protect your investment.  In the future or if you go on long trips, you may want to purchase more memory cards.  <br><br>
