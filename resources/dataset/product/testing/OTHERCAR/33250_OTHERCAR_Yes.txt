            The Olympus Camedia E-10 is a near perfect Digital Camera. Boasting a stunning 4.0 megapixel CCD this camera can take pictures with more detail than many people would ever notice. 

Detail was one of the first items I noticed about the pictures the E-10 could take. It combines a 4.0 megapixel CCD with a large Dynamic range to not only give you highlights and shadows but detail inside those regions. This is one thing many cameras lack. Not only did it pick up on the hidden details but the camera recorded colors and standard detail with fine precision. Coupled with a high quality lens the camera was able to make vibrant colors and pictures so real they no longer seemed digital.

But detail is not all that the E-10 has to offer. Functionality and performance are high on the list. With a LCD screen that pops out and swivels you can hold the camera virtually anywhere and still frame your shot. Unfortunatly while doing this it does tend to suck your batteries dry. But aside from that annoyance the various modes and options allow you to control every aspect of this camera with relative ease. Not only that but the program mode will take breath taking pictures without any settings or descions.

Finally the inclusion of dual memory slots makes this camera versatile and very conveient when taking pictures or shooting mini-movies. You can store your information on either Smart Media, or Compact Flash memory cards.
