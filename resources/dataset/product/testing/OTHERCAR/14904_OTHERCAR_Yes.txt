            This Camera is great.  I bought it for my work, an dI found it to be much more than I bargained for.  It was a hit for my whole family.  From my wife to my teenager, to my mother in law.  Everyone was using it to take pictures.  We've been sending them out to family and friends.  Some pictures have even made it into the Xmas Card this year.

If you want a cheap and hard to figure out camera don't but this one.  But if you want a reasonably priced camera that's extremely easy to use for all ages, I suggest this one.  Believe me I've been in computers for years, and even for an old techie like me, this camera never gets old.<br><br>
