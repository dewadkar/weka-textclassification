            I bought a 1999 Grand Am in October 1998.  

I HATE this car.  It is poorly built and equally poorly put together.  

It is noisy when you are driving with the windows up. It sounds like you have not shut the door all the way.

The engine is GUTLESS, it sounds nice inside the car - but when you try jump off the block, it's slow and takes a while to get up to speed.

The interior is nice and roomy, the dash is cool looking, the back seats are roomy and have enough leg room.  BUT - have you had to sit in the middle back seat on the HUMP???  That is not a fun seat to sit on!!

For the money - I would have gone with a Grand Prix.<br><br>
