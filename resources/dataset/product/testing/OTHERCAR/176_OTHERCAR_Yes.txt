            I have had nothing but fun with this camera.  I think this Is a must to have.  It is very easy to use.  I got this camera because Fuji has a great name in cameras.  I have used it for work by taking pictures of things I sell and doing an add.  You can email 
pictures to friends far away.  I use it every day and do not know how I did it without this new toy.<br><br>
