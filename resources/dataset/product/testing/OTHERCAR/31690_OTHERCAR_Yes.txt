            This car is fast.  You FEEL the 240 hp 3.8L Supercharged V6 under the hood, and it corners with the best of them. 

Unlike some of the other epinions I've read here, I think this car is extremely comfortable... leather, lumbard feel in the driver's seat, and seat warmer.  I'm a big guy and I don't think I've been as comfortable in a car like this one with the exception of Cadillacs and other luxury cars.

Also, the 16" high performace tires won't cost you $200 a piece unless you're buying Michelin racing tires you don't need.  I just put two new tires on mine and they cost me $55/tire.  Granted, they are cheapies, but Goodyear and even Pirelli sell tires that fit the GTP's for under $80/tire.  

I have had one window motor replaced after it failed, and the other one doesn't sound like it's going to make it much further.  That's my biggest complaint about this car.  Luckily, even though I bought it used, that's still covered under the warranty.  I can't beleive Pontiac still puts these window motors in their cars after they've been failing on Grand Am's and Prix's since the early 90's!!  

To me, that isn't bad, for the worst thing to wrong on your car to be a window motor.  I've had no transmission problems and no electrical problems whatsoever.  

Yes, it probably takes a mechanic to work on this car, but this car is MUCH easier to work on than any Honda, Toyota, Nissan, etc. these days.  But wouldn't you rather a professional mechanic work on your new car then yourself?  Thinking you know what you're doing, and you screw things up, and start blaming Pontiac?  The 3800 Series II engine is one of the best made.  One thing I <i>do</i> wish it had...... MANUAL TRANNY!  Why are there no GTP's with manual transmission?  It does come with performance shift, but that does not compare.  Just as well, you can still spin the tires and do a 1/4 mile in 14 seconds.

It's safe to say I LOVE this car, and encourage anyone who wants real performance and a comfortable ride all in one to go with the GTP.
