            We just bought the Sony Digital Mavica camera. My parents have one and we really liked theirs, so we decided to invest in one.

We have two kids and film and processing tends to get a little expensive at times. We needed something that we could update family with, without the hassle of cost to do it.

I love this camera! I can do black and white pictures, sepia (brownish pictures), negative art and solarization. So I can do a different variety of photos without having to buy a special camera or special film to do it.

This camera lets you take panoramic, self portrait, sports and other types of pictures.

I like that I do not have to install software on my personal computer to download and view the photos. All the pictures I take go straight onto a floppy disk.

I also like the fact that you can delete a picture off the disk when you are viewing the pictures on the camera. It saves you time to be able to do this.

This camera is lightweight and easy to use. It is easy to find accessories to go with it. I like the style of the camera itself because it is easy to hold and easy to use.

The camera came with a shoulder strap that you can put on it. The directions shows you exactly how to put it on. 

The camera comes with a rechargeable battery and battery charger. The battery has a quick charge time and lasts for a long time.

The directions are easy to use and really understandable. I was able to set the date and time on it in no time at all. I was also able to learn about all the specialties of the camera and understand them in a short time.

If you are looking to purchase this digital camera, look around some. If you are comfortable with purchasing online, I would suggest you check out different sites that carry this camera. I bought my Sony Digital Mavica at Office Depot for $499.99. I have seen this camera in stores for about that price.

This digital camera is a perfect addition for any family. All my family members are out of state so I send e-mail updates of the kids to them. I love taking pictures for the photo album and this is an inexpensive way for me to keep up.<br><br>
