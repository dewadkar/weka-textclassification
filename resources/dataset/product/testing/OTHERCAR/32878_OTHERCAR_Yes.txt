            College students typically drive two types of cars: pieces of junk or expensive parting gifts from their parents.  I have found the middle ground.  My Olds 88 is a wonderful car.  It does not have the handling of a small sporty car, but it does have a comfortable ride.  It's comfort is most noticeable to me when I have to make the bi-annual 1,000+ mile drive to or from home.  I've had to have the air conditioning refurbished, this was an expensive task and the serpentine belt had to be replaced due to wear, but other than that there is nothing wrong with this car.  It has well over a 100,000 miles on it and it's still running great.

My father bought the car used from a neighbor and then gave (for which i can't thank him enough) it to me.  I plan on keeping this car well into my late 20's, I don't feel the need to buy a new car once the money arrives to do so.  This car is enough: practical, reliable and comfortable.

Also of note is the gas mileage I can get with such a large and relatively old car.  Highway miles have given me about 32 mpg.  Not too bad, if i say so.

Oh, one problem with the car that I have found is that the driver and passenger seats do not recline.<br><br>
