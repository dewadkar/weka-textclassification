            I'm here to tell you that buying a camera is a personal thing.  While reviews can be helpful, ultimately it is a tradeoff among 2 or three considerations that are most important to you.  I have owned this camera for about 6 months and am very pleased with it, but let me tell you what tradeoffs I had to make.

First of all, my decision was between the NIKON Coolpix 3100, the NIKON Coolpix 4300 (4Mpixel), the CANON POWERSHOT ELPH S300 (3.2 MPixel), and the CANON Powershot Elph S400 (4 Mpixel). In terms of the quality of the picture, all 4 of these camera have good lenses and microcomputer processing capabilities.

The first thing you need to decide is if you want to learn the details of photography (such as how to change f-stop to alter what portion of the photo is in focus), or if you just want a camera to point and shoot and get great everyday photos... if you want the latter, then these 4 cameras are your prime considerations.

Next, you have to decide whether camera size or the number of megapixels is more important to you, since the cameras with more megapixels come with many other features that make them larger, more complex, and more expensive... 

Let's first look at camera size... for me, I wanted a camera that I could throw into my pocket - not one that I would need to put a strap on and throw over my shoulder... this may not sound like a big deal, but if you actually want to take the camera with you, 95% of the time the camera with the shoulder strap will sit in your closet.  For this reason, I immediately ruled out the Coolpix 4300, which is much bigger than any of the others...

Now for Megapixels, as a guy I was naturally drawn toward the higher megapixel Canon Powershot Elph S400.  After all, what would I say when my friend showed me his or her 4.0 or 5.0 megapixel camera and mine was only 3.2?  The reality is that unless you plan to shoot pictures and blow them up to a size greater than 11 x 14, the 3.2 megapixel cameras have sufficient clarity to make them look professional.  One other reason to purchase a 4.0 or 5.0+ megapixel camera would be if you plan to take pictures to be blown up to 8"x10" or more and you want to crop your original photos (in other words, use the camera to take a picture and then zoom in on a portion of the photo you just shot and take another picture of that portion of your original picture.  In these cases, you will want a camera with 4-5 megapixels.  For cropping and zooming in on photos that you plan to print to 5x7 or smaller, you will not be able to notice a difference between a 3.2 megapixel camera and one with higher resolution.  For me, 3.2 megapixels was enough, and therefore I didn't feel the need to spend the extra $100 or so...so the S400 was out for me...

OK, now let's look at other considerations between these two cameras...

The Canons have an internal rechargeable battery within the camera while the Nikons use AA batteries (alkaline or rechargeable NiMh) that cannot be charged within the camera, but need to be charged in a separate charger.  Some people will tell you that the internal rechargeable battery is more convenient, but the reality is that with this option you need to still carry something with you... namely, the recharger.  Additionally, when the Canon battery dies, you need to either plug the camera into the wall (hence you can no longer take pictures), or replace the internal rechargeable battery with a spare (Approx $80-90 for the battery and charger).  So I'm not sure this is easier or better than just swapping out 2 rechargeable batteries.  In fact, on a trip or when you are doing a lot of shooting, the AA rechargeable option will allow you to shoot longer and at a lower cost.  For my Nikon, I purchased a Maha MMF-C204H charger and 4 sets of POWEREX 2200 mAh AA batteries on-line for about $65.  Whereas rechargeable batteries of yesteryear only held about 1/2 the charge of alkaline batteries, these particular batteries actually hold MORE juice than alkaline batteries.  So instead of carrying around the charger (for the Canons) I carry around a small case with the rechargeable batteries.

Comfort/Grip... This was what sold it for me... the Coolpix 3100 actually fits in your right hand comfortable and allows you to turn the camera on, zoom, and shoot all with one hand.  The Canons on the other hand are so "boxy" is style that they are not at all comfortable to hold... you feel like you are going to drop them at any time... the Nikon has geometry that gives you confidence while you are holding the camera.   

Lastly, the Nikon has a great SCENE mode that allows you to take pictures in "SNOW/BEACH" mode, "MUSEUM" mode, etc... it also has a Best Shot mode where the camera takes multiple pictures within a very short timeframe and then chooses the one with the best clarity, exposure, etc...

SO when you go to buy a camera, you need to decide what features are most important to you... for me, the Nikon 3100 fit the bill..
