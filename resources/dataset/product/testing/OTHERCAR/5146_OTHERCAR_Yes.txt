            WOW! what can I say about my Dakota R/T other than it's more fun to drive than ought to be legal. And the cops in my home town seem to agree judging by the way I get pulled over every time I leave the house..lol.. well if you have read my review on the radar detector than you already know that I drive my truck the way it was meant to be driven.. FAST and Furious! cheap movie plug intended..

****************************************************
Note: I have installed the following after market items:
****************************************
*performance tuning chip by Jet  
*AirRaid Intake air filter 
*Air Bag suspension with hidden compressor & gauges and controls under the dash in-cab
*Scorchers tires with the yellow stripes (..and ..yes they do leave yellow burn out marks) (big smile)

**************************************************
Already equipped at time of purchase from the dealership:
******************************************************
*5.9 liter 8 cylinder engine that has power to spare
*a "slammed" for the baby boomers "Lowered sport suspension" 
*A Flow Master cat-back Exhaust (that rumbles so sweeeet!!)
it sets off all the neighborhood's car alarms as I go by on my way to the gym at 430am (sorry kids) 
*Dark tinted windows that get's the attention of the local law enforcement.. 
*Billet aluminum wheels with a kind of razor pattern that gives the truck a cool look. 
overhead console with various digital readouts for gas mileage (were they kidding?) miles traveled, time, temp, compass ect:
Two shallow drink holders in the armrest center console that are not suitable for anything other than change.. take my word on this one! ooops!

*************************************************
The unexpected factory features that I could have lived without:
**********************************************
a top speed rev limiter that cuts the engine off at 114mph (what is up with that????) 
and the inability to set the cruise control at a speed of over 85mph.. (major bummer)

but I guess they are thinking of my safety huh? yeah right!

So there I was on this open straight away, on a bright clear day, no cars in either direction as far as the eyes can see, Godsmack is pumping from the speakers, so I decide to see what this baby has in her.. I let her rip ..and she doesn't disappoint me.. I am really moving and then.... ugh ..ugh.. ugh.. at 114mph it cuts out.. (whaaaaat???) so I let off on the gas and it comes back to life... huh? i put my foot into it again... snf then 114mph... it's no go!

)&*^(^%*^$ I scream!!! what the heck is up with that? A top speed rev limiter?????? It can't be!!! NO!!! How could they give you all this power in one hand and then stiffel it with the other? 

It's like winning the lottery only to be told that you can't cash the check.. you can only look at it.. it takes all the fun out of winning.

But on the bright side of that dilemna, I guess it keeps me out of jail..and off of the slab..which is always a plus. But it's my dad's fault any ways..He was a flat track racer and I grew up at the track watching him race, so it's in my blood..fast bikes and fast cars.. I may get older but I refuse to grow up. sorry mom.

I'm not going to bother describing the interior fabric or the multi-position control seats... because I didn't buy my truck for that.. in fact it could have come with milk crates to sit on for all I care.. I bought it for performance.. and it performs.. so screw the interior. I'll probably put in custom seats any how.

But a added feature that some may appreciate is the key switch that allows you to disable the passenger air bag at will. My passengers are always greatfull for all the safety restraints.. but I do realize not everyone is the street demon I am.. Watch out boys I'll take your money and your trucks!!

UPDATE
************************

There has been a ton of stories out there about DAKOTA & Durango owners plagued by transmission failures or transmission issues. Add us to the list... anyone thinking of purchasing a 1999-2003 should pay special attention to the transmission issues. they can be costly to repair and you should consider this into the total cost of ownership.
