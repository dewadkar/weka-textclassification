            As soon as we saw our first Cruiser my husband and I were hooked.  We visited our Chrysler dealership and took the first car available.  A silver Cruiser...no extras.  I was giving up a Bonneville...you know "a luxury, sport car with an attitude"...for an inexpensive retro car/SUV/station wagon/even small truck as motor vehicle calls it!
  
We received it in June, 2000 and drove it down south for two weeks in August.  My husband and I are tall and I have  back problem and we both found the seats very comfortable.  They are like sitting on a well cushioned dining chair rather than sinking in a  comfortable low bucket seat with your legs out in front of you. After being in a car for any length of time it was hard to crawl out of the Bonneville seats. We hooked up with a family and their  teenager down south.  They just bought a Volvo station wagon and the teenager loved riding around in our car instead of theirs. It easily fit all five of us when we went out and about.

It is easy to drive, but admittedly has some blind spots. I find it hard to park if I am backing into a spot. Just don't know where the back is. 

The inside is an attention getter and all the necessary gauges and knobs easy to use and get used to.

Some don't think it has any get up and go...but I use the Cruiser to cruise...not race.  I notice it's a bit sluggish going up hills but it isn't really a negative point with me.
 
My grandchildren love to go in the Cruiser because they can see out the windows better while in their car seats.
We have used the Cruiser to deliver bulky items to friends and relatives..and they can't believe how much room is available when you fold up the seats or remove them. When it's in a parking lot you notice how small it really is next to some of the huge SUV's.

When my husband was ready to give up his Toyota Celica we went everywhere and tried every car out there.  Guess what? He couldn't find anything he liked. We both wanted a Cruiser! My husbands' taupe Cruiser is a Limited Edition and is loaded to the max and still was very affordable. The only problem he has had is with the compass and temperature gadget. 
 
We always turn our cars in when they are about 5 years old.  I want to keep mine forever!  I'm babying it and park far, far away from everyone else in parking lots.

I know you either like it or not but I would recommend this little beauty to anyone that likes it. It has brought the fun back into driving for me. Every time I see one on the road I smile.
