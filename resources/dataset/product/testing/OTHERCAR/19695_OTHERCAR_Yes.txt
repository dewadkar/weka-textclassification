            Recently I bought a new Saturn and think it is a very good buy.  My reason for buying a Saturn is because it was designed to be able to pull it behind an rv without having to have the transmission redone to keep from tearing it up.  We have an rv and plan to do a lot of traveling and all we have to do is hook it on and go.  Also because it is small, it does not make extra drag and cause the rv to burn more fuel.  Also I believe it is a very safe small car.  It has duel airbags and the doors are made to withstand being hit in the side.  It is also a joy to do business with the Saturn people.  They are very friendly and always ready to help or answer you questions.  Besides what other car company invites you to their factory for a picnic once a year.  Every one should own at least one.<br><br>
