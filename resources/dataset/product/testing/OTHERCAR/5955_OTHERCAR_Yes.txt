            My husband and I were deciding between a minivan and a conversion van to accommodate our growing family of 5, with 2 big dogs.  We test drove various minivans and the Dodge Ram 1500 conversion van.  We decided to go with the Dodge Ram because of the amount of 'stretching' space it had inside compared to the minivans.  We got the two sets of captains' chairs which is an excellent feature because I can step all the way to the back seat to attend to one of the children without having to get out of the vehicle (when the t.v. is not in place).  This feature is also nice because on a rainy, snowy or otherwise cold days, I have room to gather the kids and their things together before even leaving the van.  We did purchase a van with the t.v./vcr in it.  The t.v./vcr can be removed easily.  The t.v. is so nice to have when on long trips.  The kids can watch their videos and listen to them through their own headphones while my husband and I can enjoy our own radio station from the radio up in front.  It also has a second cd player/radio for the back passengers to listen to, with or without headphones.  Each passenger can individually choose if they want to listen to the t.v. or the cd/radio depending on which port they plug their headphones into.  The only complaints I have are as follows:  The heating/cooling system - it takes quite a long time for the heat/air conditioning to become the correct temperature for the backseat passengers.  The ride is quite smooth, except for the very backseat passengers where it tends to get pretty bouncy. The pick-up, especially with a V-8 engine, is not the greatest.<br><br>
