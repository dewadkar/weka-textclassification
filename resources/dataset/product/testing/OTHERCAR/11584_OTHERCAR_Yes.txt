            Perhaps it's me, but I want in an SUV what an SUV is supposed to deliver.  Offroad reliability.  So it astounds me that the major complaint concerning the Isuzu Rodeo is its truck-like ride, this coming from Consumer Reports among others.

Well guess what?  The Rodeo is one of the few SUVs out there designed to take it off the road, from its powerful V6 engine to get you out of the mud and over the rocks, to its higher ground clearance and reinforced underside to protect against chance encounters with the occasional boulder that gets in your way.

And what's wrong with the way trucks drive today anyway?  Most of them are pretty smooth for those of us not used to the Mercedes lifestyle, and I'd like to see that BMW or Mercedes version of the Rodeo DARE to go off the carefully manicured city streets.  Chances are, they would be waiting at the side of the road for the Rodeo to tow them out of trouble.

Now, let's get back to why you should buy an Isuzu Rodeo.  I have owned a 1999 Rodeo LS with the V6 engine, oversized tires, retractable sunroof, 6-changer CD player, and a roof rack for over a year, and I couldn't be more pleased with my decision.  The first thing you notice about the Rodeo is the power of the V6.  At 205hp and 214 lb/ft of torque, the Rodeo compares favorably to the 1999 Ford Explorer XL's 160 hp and 225 lb/ft.  For those of you, like me, who couldn't decipher the above from the Japanese version of the Gettysburg Address, let me just say the Isuzu moves and moves quickly.  The engine exudes a quiet strength and the automatic transmission is smooth.  The engine was the main reason I picked the Rodeo over the more sluggish Explorer.

Another thing to like about the Rodeo is its rugged goods looks, especially with the larger tires.  It looks like it was made for the offroad, especially compared to the lower riding Explorer (7.9 inches of ground clearance vs. 6.7 inches).  Handling in the snow is also exceptional with the on-the-fly 4-wheel drive for light snow, and the winter setting for heavy snow.  You can shift the Rodeo into 4-Wheel mode while traveling as fast as 60 miles an hour.  A minor nuisance with this is that the wheels must be pointed straight ahead to get the 4-wheel drive to kick in, but I believe that is the case in most SUVs.

Among other things, the roof rack is a welcome option for extra cargo space, carrying up to 200 lbs of weight, while the regular cargo space has a storage capacity of 33 cubic feet compared to the Explorers' 43.5 cf.  Handling is satisfactory, especially for an SUV, but braking takes a little getting used to.  Give yourself some extra room because the Rodeo is slower to stop than most passenger vehicles, and the ABS seemed to make it even a little tougher.  Gas mileage is also mediocre at 16-20 mpg, but an added bonus is that the Rodeo runs great on regular unleaded 87 grade gasoline.  These are minor complaints.  The only real negative I see in the Rodeo is that it is somewhat noisy when driving at high speeds.  Perhaps I should have opted for the undercoating to reduce wind noise, but I always heard undercoating was a rip-off.

In summary, the Rodeo may not be a BMW or a Mercedes class SUV, and if you're looking for a glass-smooth ride then you should look elsewhere.  However, if you're look for a solid, powerful SUV that handles well on pavement, off road, and in the snow while looking tough enough to handle anything, consider the Rodeo.  The one I bought was a dealer vehicle with 7K miles and I got it for $23,000.  In my opinion, the Rodeo gives you the most bang for the buck.  But be sure that an SUV is what you really want.<br><br>
