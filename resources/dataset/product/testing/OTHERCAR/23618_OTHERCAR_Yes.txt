            It was the day after Thanksgiving, 1986.   My wonderful friends, Jeanette and Mick, had decided to join the masses of people beginning their holiday shopping. Their daughter, being the typical teenager, wanted to go along, but was dragging her heels getting ready.  Well, they had a beautiful new JEEP Cherokee, and decided to run a quick errand together, and then return for their daughter in 30 minutes, giving her time to finish getting ready. Now Jeanette and Mick always used their seatbelts. This is why it was such a shock to all of us that they hadn't used them on this particular errand. 

Their light was green as they went through the intersection. The man in the Camaro, fleeing the police, had the red light. That didn't stop him. He barrelled on through, smashing into Jeanette and Mick's Cherokee. The Cherokee sailed through the air, flipped over, and landed on its roof. Because Jeanette and Mick made the awful mistake of choosing not to buckle up that day, they were both ejected from the car. Jeanette lost her life at the scene of the accident. Mick held on for 3 days, in a coma, before he also died, leaving behind 2 teenage daughters.

Several months after this horrible accident, I had the opportunity to talk to one of the police officers who investigated this accident. He told me that the outside of the Cherokee was hardly even recognizable as a Cherokee. However, because the Cherokee was designed so well, the inside of the cab was in great shape. Had Jeanette and Mick kept to their usual habit of buckling up, they most likely would have lived through this wreck, sustaining only minimal injuries. 

Then, in 1996, I was in the market for a new car. Living in snowy Colorado and constantly driving my small children around, I needed something very reliable and safe. So it should be no surprise that, knowing how well Jeanette and Mick's Cherokee held up to that awful accident, the Cherokee was my first choice. I bought a brand new, bright red one! My car now has over 50,000 miles on it, and it's never been in the shop even once for repairs! 

So go get a Cherokee, and ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS buckle up! I hope that sharing Jeanette and Mick's story will save a life, as well as help someone to purchase a wonderful SUV!

   &lt;3    In loving memory of Jeanette and Mick. I miss you guys.
