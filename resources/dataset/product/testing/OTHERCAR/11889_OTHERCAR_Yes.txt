            I bought this camera as my very first digital camera.  I bought it because it was rated on the higher side of customer opinions.  It had all the details that I was particular about having.  Things like the LCD display on the back so I could view my pictures without having to have a computer handy, and removable memory media.  It also was non-platform specific.  I could use it on my Macintosh or my Windows machine.  

Agfa gets high marks from me because of the fact that their customer service was remarkable.  When I bought the camera I could take pictures with it, but could not get those pictures out of the camera onto my computer.  I tried both platforms and about 4 different computers.  Nothing was working, so I called Agfa for help.  They were willing to take me at my word about what I had already done to troubleshoot.  They sent me new cables to try and when that did not work, they sent me a whole new camera.  

I do like the camera.  It is a wonderful first digital camera.  BUT, here are the cons I have found so far.  Unless you restrict your number of photos and select the highest possible resolution, the picture quality is somewhat lacking.  I find that I prefer the second and third level of resolution just because the picture quality is such that the pictures can be printed out.  The first level is only good enough for web page images, if that.  I also find that the camera is very slow about getting ready to allow you to take pictures.  There is a small green light in the viewfinder which flashes as the camera thinks about the picture to come.  You cannot take a picture until the light stops flashing.  Now, if you are taking still shots there is no problem.  But if you are out on vacation or someplace that you want action shots, you won't get most of them just because of how long the camera takes to get ready.  

I have also found that my batteries rattle around inside the camera just a bit.  This appears to affect the battery life and it also deletes your settings in the camera.  Things like date, time, and your pictures settings;  resolution, auto-flash, etc.  My last problem is that for whatever reason, I can almost never make it through a download of my pictures to the computer without getting a message that the camera has stopped responding.  I then have to unplug the camera and plug it back in again and retry.  This happens no matter what platform, but it does happen more often on the mac, but it happens no matter what.  Agfa says that it is not a bug.

None of this is particularly problematic, it is mostly small annoyances.  I would still buy the camera as my first digital, but it has made me think a bit harder about replacing it a little earlier than I had originally planned.
