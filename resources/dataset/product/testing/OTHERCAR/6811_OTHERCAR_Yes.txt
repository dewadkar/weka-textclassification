            I bought my Mercury Sable LS Sedan on February 4, 1998.  On the whole, I love this car.  It has many wonderful features including: heated side mirrors, an electric driver's seat, driver's seat lumbar support, outside temperature readout, etc.  I was disappointed that the driver's seat features were not available for the passenger's seat, and I don't think the lumbar support feature is available even on the 2000 cars.  I am not positive about that, though.  The other things I love about this car is that it is very comfortable and very roomy inside.  The stereo system is incredible with six speakers, four in the front and two in the rear.  I love the arm support for the passengers in the rear seat, and the right side of the rear seat comes down so that if you have a long item for the trunk, you can fit it in with that side of the seat put down.  

When you have the front defroster on, the outside side mirrors also have heat.  This is a wonderful features for all of us who live in the Northeast.  The overall heating and air conditioning system is incredible. Each is almost immediate.  

The most important feature on the Sable is that there are three ways of entering the car: with the key, with the remote and there is a combination on the outside of the car on the driver's side.  When I bought the car, I wondered when anyone would use this feature.  Then I started walking in our Mall for exercise.  I locked the car and put my purse and keys in the trunk.  Most of the other people who were walking had to carry their keys.  But I didn't, because I could get into the car with the combination, open the trunk from the inside of my car and get my purse and keys.  Also, when you have an arm full of groceries, or any packages, this feature is wonderful, so you don't have to fish for your keys.

The one thing I do not like about my Sable is it is quite noisy, especially on the highway.  Again, I don't know if this problem has been solved on the 2000 Sable.  I hope so.  

On the whole, I would highly recommend buying a Mercury Sable Sedan LS.  It is very luxurious car to drive, and I feel very safe driving it.
