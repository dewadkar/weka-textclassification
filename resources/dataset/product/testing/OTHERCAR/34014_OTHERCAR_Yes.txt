            The digital camera wars have been heating up since before the holidays as the major players fight it out for a dwindling pool of scarce recession dollars.  Canon, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus, and Sony have all introduced exciting new models that offer consumers enhanced features and improved performance, and all of them are cutting prices at the same time.  Prices have also fallen on peripherals like removable storage media and re-chargeable batteries and chargers.  This tooth and nail fight for supremacy in the digital camera marketplace is a wonderful boon for digital camera buyers.  Canon has been leading the charge in this intensified battle with the introduction of several exciting new models that seek to put the Powershot family firmly in the driver�s seat of the digital photography revolution. 

Beginning with the introduction of the Powershot G2 just a few months ago Canon has leaped to the front in this high technology race.  Errors like the disappointing Pro 90 IS are clearly behind them as Canon uses a stunning mix of cutting edge technology, smart manufacturing techniques, interchangeable components, and savvy marketing to steal a march on their competitors.  Canon�s recent introduction of four new models that share components and marketing allows the company to save millions on manufacturing and promotion costs.  These savings are passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices.

The popularity of the groundbreaking G2, an exciting and feature rich four megapixel digital camera that offers advanced amateurs and pro photographers a compact digital imaging machine that provides more features and creative options than most photographers will ever need, laid the foundation for Canon�s campaign to become the most popular manufacturer of digital cameras.   Following right on the heels of the G2 Canon introduced the new A10 and A20 a pair of inexpensive feature rich entry level digital cameras.  The A10 and A 20 models are built on the same platform and offer almost identical features and performance.  The only difference between these digital imaging siblings is the size of the sensor (1.3 megapixels in the A10 and 2.3 megapixels in the A 20) It quickly became obvious to Canon�s engineers and marketing folks that the company was on the right track.  The G2, A 10, and A 20 have all sold well and received good reviews from industry professionals. 

Canon�s follow-up was another dramatic competitive move that left competitors gasping.  The introduction of two compact stainless steel beauties that are built on the G2 platform.  The G2 is an updated version of Canon�s very popular G1 introduced about 18 months ago, so the technology is proven, the components are already in the pipeline, and the popularity of the G1 and G2 have built a huge base of consumer goodwill that makes marketing the new models easy.

My Friend (who sells and distributes photographic equipment) showed up the Saturday before St. Patrick�s Day with both cameras and asked if I wanted come out and play.  He knows that I love to check out new camera models, so my answer was a foregone conclusion.  We sat down to plan out how we would test both cameras simultaneously and how we would judge the results of our tests.  Since the cameras are identical except for resolution it was decided that I would use the S30 and my friend would use the S40 and that we would do our best to duplicate each test shot with both cameras.  My friend thought the compact stainless steel S 30/S 40 body looked very cool and the sliding lens cover reminded him of the classic Minox spy camera. The only significant difference between the two cameras is the digital sensor.  The S 30 offers 3.2 megapixels and the S 40 shares the same digital sensor that powers the 4.0 megapixel G2.  Both cameras hit store shelves with a feature/cost balance that immediately made them leaders in the battle for digital imaging consumer�s disposable income.

<b>In the Field/Handling and Operation</b>

The weather here in Kentucky has been variable with pretty warm days followed by cold gray rainy days. 
We tested the cameras over the course of the St. Patrick�s Day weekend, which was cold, gray, and rainy�not optimal camera testing weather.  We first set up a macro stage (Children, you can try this at home�for directions see my review of the Olympus E 20N digital camera�the URL is listed below) and spread out a collection of brightly colored plastic beach toys, on a white background, that we use to test digital camera color.  After manually white balancing the cameras we used both the S 30 and the S 40 to shoot brightly colored red, green, blue, and yellow plastic shapes.  Both cameras passed the color test with flying colors.  Colors were well saturated and accurate. The camera's White Balance handled test lighting pretty well, though we both noticed a very slight warm cast with the Auto setting.  The  Manual white balance setting produced the best results overall. The S 30/S 40 had some difficulty with incandescent (yellow) lighting (without flash) but when used with the flash the incandescent setting achieved nearly neutral results in the close range.  The S 30/S 40 white balance worked better than most of the current digital cameras available under artificial lighting.  Performance from both cameras in this test was virtually identical to the tests we had done with the Canon G2.  

After finishing up with the basic color test we took both cameras outdoors to shoot some �street� shots of the colorfully clad characters returning from the St. Patrick�s Day Parade. Simon Kenton, one of Daniel Boone�s friends and a fellow �long hunter� who helped Boone explore Kentucky, was an Irishman.  Kenton was the first of many new residents from the Shamrock Isle to settle in the Bluegrass State. The Derby City was a popular destination for Irish immigrants during most of the 19th Century, and Louisville still has large Irish presence.  Our local celebration has a much more provincial flavor than those in New York, Boston, and Dublin, with the spectators making up for our lack of sophistication with an abundance of enthusiasm and creativity.  We spent about an hour shooting groups of revelers traveling back and forth along Bardstown Road between the city�s Irish Pubs (most of which are located in the Highlands) We shot some very animated street images of local Hibernians (and Irish wannabe�s) showing off their home-made costumes.

The S30 produced consistently great color images of the passionate partyers, especially considering how dreary and gray the weather was.  Caucasian skin tones in our Outdoor tests came out a bit pink, but that may have been more a result of the brisk breeze and mid thirties temperatures than anything relevant to the S 30�s performance. Optical distortion with the excellent 3X zoom was lower than average at the wide-angle end, and the telephoto setting produced virtually distortion free images.  Chromatic aberration (purple fringing) was noticeable but well controlled.  The zoom displayed some noticeable softness in the corners of the frame. 

Low light performance was well above average.  Noise in longer exposures is well controlled, even at the ISO 800 setting.  Macro performance is very good with high resolution in close-up images.  The S 30�s flash performance is about average for point�n�shoot digital cameras, a bit weak for general shooting and a little hot for macro work.  The S30 is surprisingly fast (especially when compared to other three megapixel digital cameras). Shutter lag is relatively non-existent, and shot to shot times are excellent. The S 30 can shoot up to seven �hi res� images in sequence before users must wait for the buffer to empty. The S 30 is a great camera for photographers/parents interested in capturing children at play and fast-paced action. 

<b>A Few Concerns</b>

The 3X zoom lens on the S 30/S 40 is not threaded for use with add on lens adapters or filters. The flash is weak and it�s unfortunate that Canon didn�t allow some sort of method for using external flash with the camera. Battery life is decent (Canon says 180-200 images with constant LCD use and over 400 using only the optical viewfinder) we got a bit more than two hours of heavy use from a fully charged battery (moderate LCD use). The included 16Mb standard CF card isn�t going to provide enough storage for anything more than a minor event.  You�ll need to purchase at least one 64Mb card and an additional battery to fully utilize the S 30, so be sure to factor the additional cost into your price comparisons. 

 
<b>Conclusion</b>

After we finished our tests we printed the two best image pairs at 5X7 and 8X10 on an Epson Stylus Photo EPX 785 that we�ve been testing (watch for the upcoming review of this exciting �digital darkroom� tool).  We then compared the printed images side by side using a Mamiya 4X loupe designed for inspecting medium format prints.  Our test prints were judged on the following criteria: color accuracy, white balance, resolution, contrast, and the subjective �look� of the prints.  Prints from the S 30 compared favorably to the 4 megapixel prints from the S 40.  Color, contrast, resolution, and �look� were comparable to any three megapixel camera currently available in terms of overall image quality.  The S30 is an excellent general-use digital camera that produces exceptional three megapixel images. The S 30 offers users just about all the manual exposure controls they might want, but works beautifully for novice photographers who want to shoot creative high quality digital images without learning basic photography skills.  Overall, the Canon Powershot S 30 is an excellent option for consumers who want a full featured digital camera at a good price.  Recommended without reservation.
