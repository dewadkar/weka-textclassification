            Stability and safety - YES, but also Sexy. I've had my 1999 Neon for a year and a half now and I've NEVER been happier. Just enough verve to have a blast, but not enough to catch the eye of the police! This is definitely a family car. If you want to haul a horse trailer, move all of your belongings across the country, or carpool with a half-dozen kids, pass on this car. But! If you are a single person (or a couple) who values good gas mileage, room for a few friends, a quiet ride with a decent stereo, zipping handily through traffic and stopping on a dime, BUY A NEON!<br><br>
