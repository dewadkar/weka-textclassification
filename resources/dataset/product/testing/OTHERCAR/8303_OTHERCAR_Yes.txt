            I purchased my 2003 Toyota Corolla a few days ago and therefore I have been driving it only a short time.  I did not like the previous Corolla model, it wasn't for me, the styling of this model is what drew me in.  I chose the LE model which has many features of a luxury car:  ABS, leather interior, power moonroof, anti-theft, etc...  We didn't need to add any other options to our car.  I previously drove a 1996 Camry DX V6 but did not want to buy such a large car given my daily commute.  I see a lot of qualities in Corolla that I enjoyed in the Camry.  The Camry was a very reliable car for me and I had no problems with it.

The Corolla seems very well built, the interior is not noisy as I have read.  It is a little noisier than the Camry but then again, it is smaller.  I have found that the interior is roomy and not cramped for the driver, however I could see the rear passengers being a bit cramped.  I am very impressed with the console, everything is laid out well and in easy reach.  The map lights on the rear view mirror is really handy as well as the anti-glare mechanism (very cool).  The "bucket" seats are very comfortable, perhaps a tad small for the "husky" person.

Having had the 190 HP of the Camry, I have noticed that the engine is a little short on power with it's 130 HP.  However, you do have to compromise power to save fuel consumption so this is a personal choice.  The 4 speed auto transmission seems smooth in shifting and compliments the VVT engine.  I have noticed that since the Corolla is much taller than the previous model, in windy conditions, you can feel the car being pushed.  This perhaps wasn't an issue in the previous model (shorter, closer to ground).  I think it's important that you pay attention to this during your test drive.

Suspension is good, I can't say it's the best, I am "lucky" to live in a city with many pot holes so it is very obvious.
