            During my recent trip to Florida, I had the pleasure of driving around my father's new 2002 Volkswagen Passat GLS Sedan.  Having been a fan of coupes my whole life, I was a little reluctant to give the Passat a fair shake, despite being the one who suggested this model to my father when he was in search of replacing his aging Camry.

I have to tell you that, after spending over a week tooling around Orlando in this car, I am (almost) completely impressed.  Over the past several years, ever since the newly styled Passat hit the roads of America, it has typically be rated one of the best mid-size family sedans available - at any price, and with good reason.

Volkswagen has really turned the tide into producing stylish, somewhat affordable, exceptionally safe and lightning-fast cars for all types of driving enthusiasts.  Make no mistake, while the Passat is considered a family car in the same scope as the Camry and Honda Accord, this is actually a well-engineered driving machine.

The Passat comes in 3 different trim levels, with two engine options and three different transmission options.  For my testing purposes, I was behind the wheel of a GLS with the 1.8L Turbo-charged 4 cylinder engine that produced a hefty 170 horsepower behind a 5-speed manual transmission (It is my father's car after all...)  I found that the 1.8L Turbo-4 was exceptionally spirited when pushed.  Normal turbo lag was evident at lower speeds and lower RPMs, but one that Turbo kicked in, the car jumped to life.  Even escorting 4 adults (and one child) didn't seem to lend any additional strain to this otherwise smallish engine.  Fully loaded or not, it performed like an absolute dream each and every time.  The only issue I discovered when driving around town was that the steering seemed to be under powered - almost to the point of making it difficult to manipulate at slower/zero speeds.  But as speed increased, the steering felt far more comfortable without feeling floaty.

Inside the cockpit, you'll find a traditionally sparse environment which, with the addition of a $650 wood-grain option, looks a little better than most.  The display, however, is something to behold as it splits the darkness with a combination of red and purple dials, knobs and readouts that's truly unique.  Some may not appreciate it or find it distracting.  I absolutely loved it.

The cabin was very large and roomy - making full use of every possible square inch.  4 Adults plus one child in a car seat easily fit in the car with some room to spare.  The cloth interior also had a nice, substantial feel to it. Leather, of course, is an available option.

And speaking of options, actually the Passat comes with very few. That's because each base model is over loaded with features.  See my list of options and more at the end of this review.

Safety isn't an issue with the Passat.  Not only does it snug the road with assurance, it's built with multiple crumple zones to sustain the brunt of an impact should one occur.  Additionally, each Passat comes with standard front and side air bags for both the driver and passenger.  Plus, Volkswagen has employed their own Side Curtain Protection (tm) system for added protection for the head and upper torso in the event of a severe side collision.

The ride in the Passat, as alluded to above, is very secure, if not a little rigid.  Clearly, this car wants to perform and has the stability to do just that.  And while highway travel is safe, secure and nimble, taking it over a jittery road way will result in a somewhat bumpy ride.  But even when it is being tossed around by some crater-sized potholes, the Passat remains solid through and through.  Rattles and shakes are never heard - it sounds and feels like one giant piece of fortified and insulated metal.  Time will tell if the Passat holds it's shape and security together, but it seems exceptionally well built for now.

The 2002 Passat had some elegant treatment performed on its outer shell.  Head and tail lights received an upgrade that improve the overall appearance of the car.  A new grill and larger VW logo also add to its appeal. Fit and finish on the inside and out are at typical and superb German standards.  This isn't just a car, it's a work of art.

But, of course, there is a price.  Since, as mentioned above, Passats come fully loaded with few available options, the price reflects this fact accordingly.  Ranging from $21,000 to $31,000 and beyond, be prepared to shell out a fair amount of money.  But with all of its features, it's clearly superior workmanship, it's powerful engine (the V6 is even more so than the Turbo 4), the Passat is clearly worth the money.

Also, the Passat isn't without some problems.  First, unfortunately, the starter caught on fire which led to a minor engine fire.  This happened while idling at a gas station.  It was extinguished before causing any real damage, but it was a frightening and questionable event.  The dealer and VW corporate were quick to act - and apologize - but I have to tell you, that's something that simply should not happen with a car of this caliber.  But, no one is perfect.  Also, two of the dash dials seem to be stuck.  Nothing major, just an annoyance more than any thing else.

Aside from those occurrences that are hopefully isolated events, I can fully recommend the Passat.  A test drive or two and you're sure to fall in love with it as well.
