            Lexus, who is known for it's luxury cars finally made something sporty and luxorius.  The Lexus GS400 is one of the most amazing cars I've ever seen.  The V-8 300 HP engine is incredibly powerful and takes off in no time.  The car is incredibly quiet, smooth and it's an excellent ride.  The dual climate control is also quite nice.  Another great thing about this car is the navigation.  This system is incredibly accurate and can take you to the door of anywhere in America.  The screen is big, easy to read and integrates well with the radio.  When using it with the radio, or 6-cd player it can be used as a touch screen and you can just touch the radio station, or cd you want to play.  This is definitely one amazing car, with everything and more you could want from a car.<br><br>
