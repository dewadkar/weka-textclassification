                    I just purchased this new mini-van and let me tell you all about it.  It is a wonderful addition to the line of reliable Toyota vehicles.  The Sienna has everything you need in a mini-van!  A great price, dependability, and surprisingly  great gas mileage.  
	I was considering buying a Suburban or another SUV, but with the rising gas prices, the Sienna was a better choice.  I got it for just under $21,900 with all the necessities like: automatic drive, CD player, air conditioning, power locks and windows, etc.  If you are looking for a new family vehicle, this is the van for you!
