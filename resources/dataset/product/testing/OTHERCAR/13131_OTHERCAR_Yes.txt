            We Purchased our 1999 Lumina in June of 1999.  This wasn't our first choice but with the lack of down payment we had at the time, we were able to get an affordable monthly note along with a nice looking and riding vehicle. We went from a 1986 Chevrolet Astro Van to this Lumina.  If we would have had more for a down payment to make our notes affordable according to our means, I would have chosen an Impala.  Hopefully in years to come we may be able to trade it in.

Don't get me wrong, We love our Lumina!  Out of the vehicles available through Chevrolet, this vehicle was our choice as the one for us.  Of course, without looking at the Impala.  This vehicle rides well on the highway and is a nice car for those who can't afford high monthly notes.  I am a mother of grown children and 2 grandchildren and this car is perfect for me.  I had outgrown my Astro Van being we no longer had baseball and scouting to attend.  <br><br>
