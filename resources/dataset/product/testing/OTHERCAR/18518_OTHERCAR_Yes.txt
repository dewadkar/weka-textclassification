            I received the FujiFilm MX-600Zoom Camera for christmas this year. My father and I picked it out together and opted to get the 8 meg chip so that we'd have more room for pics. We have never been sorry! This camera is compact yet takes excellent pictures! The zoom feature works great for capturing details and the colors are amazing! 

The upload software that comes with the camera is so simple to use, that my 9 year old can do it! The Adobe Picture This software that is included is also easy to use and has so many extra features that I've almost completely given up my old standard cannon camera for good!

I use this camera mainly for adding pictures to my online auctions, but it works equally well for grabbing those great candid pictures of my 3 children! There is nothing like emailing pictures to the grandparents just minutes after they were taken! Finally, pictures to share when the kids still look like that!

Definitely worth the money, but I highly recommend getting the additional chip for more pics. Directions are easy to understand and it functions wonderfully.<br><br>
