            Up until 1987, I was a staunch Cadillac man.  Every three to five years depending on how well I liked the Caddy I currently owned, I would trade for a new one. Never once did I ever even consider a Lincoln.

Well, in the 1980's Cadillac was experimenting with a number of new motors like the 8/6/4, the 4100 and others. At this point, I was experiencing more problems and difficulties with my Cadillacs than I ever had in the past and was becoming somewhat disillusioned with the marque.  

Then, in September of 1987 I wandered into the local Lincoln dealership just to take a look and a couple of hours later was driving home in my new 1988 Lincoln Town Car.  I was amazed at how comfortable, roomy and quiet the car was.  I found it to be superior to any Cadillac I had ever owned.  I drove that '88 Town Car for five absolutely trouble-free years.

In 1992, I traded it for a 1993 Town Car and this one I owned longer than any previous car I had ever owned.  I kept that car until October of 1998 when I traded it for my latest Town Car, my beautiful 1999.

In the meantime, Cadillac abandoned the &quot;Boomer&quot; market by eliminating their flagship, front-engine, rear-drive Fleetwood after the 1996 model year in order to capture more of the Lexus, Mercedes market with their smaller, front-drive cars now sporting the Cadillac crest.  I'm sure this drove even more of the traditional Cadillac buyers straight into their local Lincoln dealerships, and I'm sure most of them are tickled pink about it.

The 1999 Town Car is as quiet and luxurious as a car can get.  Six full figured adults can ride in silken, quiet comfort.  Everything about the Town Car emotes luxury and class, from the glove soft leather of the seats to the impressive JBL stereo system.  I wish my home stereo unit sounded as nice as the one in my car.

The controls have a posh look and feel very positive and of the highest quality when being used.  You cannot even hear the power window motors as they are working. 

The Town Car provides more than ample power from its 4.6 liter overhead cam V8 while providing impressive gas mileage for such a large, heavy vehicle.  On a trip, I usually average 22-24 MPG on regular 87 octane gas.  Nothing to sneeze at now that gas prices are near the $2.00 per gallon mark.  I realize you don't buy a Town Car for its gas mileage, but it certainly is a nice benefit nonetheless.

I find the quiet though to be the Town Car's most outstanding feature.  At highway speeds, the outside never intrudes into the ultra quiet cabin.  To me, this is what luxury is all about.  I want to arrive at my destination as relaxed and rested as if I had spent a comfortable evening in my favorite recliner, and this is what the Town Car delivers in spades.

I truthfully cannot find one thing negative to report regarding Town Cars. I honestly feel that a better car cannot be had at any price.  I have had the opportunity to ride in the big Benz's and even had a pleasant ride in my company CEO's Bentley, and to be perfectly truthful, my Town Car was far roomier and substantially quieter than either of the fine European offerings.

The Town Car is the ideal car for the man or woman who like myself, recalls the grandeur and style of the big American luxury cars of times gone by.  A car that gets you from point A to point B with a minimum of fuss and effort and a boatload of class.

My hat's off to the folks at Ford Motor Company for staying true to the American luxury car ideals and not abandoning all of us graying, Boomers.  Thank you and BRAVO for a job well done!<br><br>
