            I love my Jeep Wrangler because it is the only combination of convertible and four wheel drive available on the market.  It is well suited for my interests of both driving in the snow to Lake Tahoe as well as offroading and riding in the sun during the summer.

The new Wrangler (starting in 1997) has done a terrific job making what was once a very no-frills vehicle very drivable.  The new instrument panel as well as new suspension have made the ride a much more pleasant and less jarring experience.  Make no mistakes, the Jeep is still no luxury vehicle, and the handling and performance are all much harder and stiffer than a commuting rider would normally desire.  In addition, there are no power lock options or other amenities.  The car can still be hosed down if muddy or sandy  because of its water resistant seats, removable floor upholstery and drain plugs.

The new Wrangler also has a much improved soft top, which legitimately takes 5 minutes to put up and less to take down alone -- a vast improvement from the old one which could required 2 people and could take 10 - 15 minutes.  In addition, the hard top can be installed over the folded down softtop, making it easier to put on the hard top with less hassle.

The Sport model comes standard with a V6 engine, which I believe is the ideal motor for this car.  With the V6, the Wrangler has good pickup and towing ability because of its light weight, and has the performance I desire from a fun SUV.  The 4 cylinder definately feels underpowered (especially going up hills or when the top is down and there is additional drag).

The base sound system is less than adequate for a convertible, and the sound bar is almost a necessity for back seat passengers to hear anything and for the front seat passengers to hear on the highway with the top down.  Even with the sound bar, the stock speakers are at best adequate, with limited bass response due to their location above your head and inability to vibrate within the car.

The only reall concern is that the Wrangler has no lockable trunk area with the soft top or with the hard top off, and  is not secure to leave possessions in.  My sport model came with a center storage box that has limited capacity and third party vendors do make locking trunk boxes, but all are less than ideal.  Get used to taking things with you and being able to leave nothing valuable in the car ever.

In summary, if you are outdoors oriented and need a car that is both fun in the snow and in the summer, the Wrangler is perfect.  Do not get this car if you have a long commute and are sensitive to comfort or wind noise while driving, it is a hard ride, noisy and guzzles gas!  Do get it if you love to have fun and want a car with personality and the ability to go anywhere and do anything.
