            I own a 1999 ALTIMA GXE, but how did I exactly choose this car out of many other popular family sedans, here's the story.  I had made up my mind that I needed a new family sedan, but I had not yet decided which company to buy from and which model to buy.  My primary choices were the Nissan ALTIMA and Toyota CAMRY, I went out and did a bit of research.  I found out that the Camry was obviously a bit larger both inside and outside, the Camry had a lot of leg-room compared to the ALTIMA but on the other hand the ALTIMA had a lot of head-room compared to the Camry.  The ALTIMA GXE priced around $16,000-18,000 had a lot more standard features than it's equivalent model the Camry LE priced around $18,000-20,000.
The ALTIMA GXE had standard automatic doors,windows,mirrors,locks, and remote keyless entry. It also had standard Italian Burl Wood-Grain Trim, although the Camry didn't, you had to purchase the luxury model in order to get standard wood trim. I also found out that the ALTIMA, regardless to it's compact size, had a much stronger engine than it's equivalent Camry.  The ALTIMA had a 2.4 liter engine with about 150 horsepower, the Camry only had a 2.1 liter engine with about 120 horsepower, amazingly the ALTIMA was just as fuel efficient as the Camry. Both cars had standard dual second generation air-bags. I went out and took a test-drive for both vehicles, although the Camry had a more relaxed feel due to it's vast leg-room, it didn't have a very quiet ride, but the ALTIMA had a very quiet ride even with it's powerful 150 horsepower engine.

After all the pros and cons I decided to purchase the NISSAN ALTIMA, and I would recommend it to anyone else who is thinking about purchasing a car. I recommend you make sure the windows are tinted, it just seems to fit right!<br><br>
