            Travelling home from Florida to Virginia after a week of spring-break in the Bahamas with 3 other people is not my idea of a good time.  However, travelling in this car made it a very pleasant trip indeed.  Never have I driven a car that covered ground so smoothly and effortlessly.  This car had 125,000 miles on it, and ran like it was two weeks off the assembly line.  That speaks volumes about durability.  This particular car was a 2-door coupe with 6-speed transmission.

Driving this car is a true pleasure.  Whether around town or on the highway, the miles just seem to pass effortlessly by.  The shifter and clutch are so smooth and easy to use that even stop-and-go traffic is a joy.  Also, there is plenty of torque to start in second, which really helps in commuting through stop-and-go.

This is a heavy car, but it doesn't feel like it.  Tackle a mountain pass, and the engine just breezes to the top, even with the AC running.  On the way down, this car can slice through turns like a smaller sport coupe.  Even gas mileage is good (23-25 mpg in mixed driving).

The BOSE stereo is good, not great.  Its certainly adequate for most drivers, though if you love music as much as cars, upgrading to an aftermarket stereo is a wise decision.

LOVES:
The engine
Transmission
Handling
Comfort
Reliable

HATES:
Expensive, even when used


The engine:  Smooth as silk, quiet, power at any rpm.
The transmission:  Like all Acuras, the best transmissions on earth.  Shifts are smooth as ice
The interior:  Classy, comfortable, and luxurious
Exterior:  Sporty and luxurious at the same time
Reliability: Possibly the best in the world
Comfort: 15+ hours in the back seat of a coupe when I'm 6'5&quot; and still smiling

Who would love this car?  Anyone with a heartbeat and desire for the finer things in life.  These cars are good for 200,000 miles with virtually no unscheduled maintenance.  Why buy a cheap new car, when you can buy this for about as much and get about as many miles out of it?
