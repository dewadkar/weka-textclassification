            Dodge Durango is a powerful automobile suited for any SUV owner and SUV owner wannabe's!  It has the best pickup of any of the SUV's in it's class.  I love my Durango...would not trade it for 3 Chevy Tahoe's!  I drove the Tahoe, Expedition, Navigator, Explorer, Jimmy,and Blazer. I previously owned 2 Blazers...and was blown away by the Durango.  It is so maneurable!! It has so much cargo space!  I originally did not want the 3rd seat, but it has come in handy this Christmas season with all the nieces and nephews I have been carting around shopping to purchase  their parents Christmas gifts.  The Durango corners well, stops on a dime, and is a real head turner.  Other than a malfunctioning fuse I have had not any problems with my Durango.  If you want a stable well made SUV with power to spare...buy the Durango SLT Plus...you won't be disappointed!  <br><br>
