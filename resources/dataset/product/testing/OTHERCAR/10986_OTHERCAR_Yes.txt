            Let me start off by saying, this is my father's mini-van, but, I drive it frequently as right now, we are a one vehicle family and my dad let's me use his van for anything i have to do after my husband goes to work.
The Chevy Astro van he own's has the hard shell, turtle like top on it so, it does make it harder to find a good car wash or get into some things that have a small clearance.
My father purchased this van about 3 years ago and it has been great.
Inside, there are 4 captain chair's and a bench seat that lay's down into a bed.  
While in the back eat, you can watch a 13&quot; television or watch your favorite movie on the vcr, these were all factory installed.  There is also a second stereo that is great for the kids on trips, they just plug in their head phones and no arguing about the radio station.
There have been virtually no problems with this van, as i find Chevy's are usually pretty good and trust worthy.
The engine is still clean and in good condition.  
He purchased this van as used with 13,000 miles on it in 1997, it is a 1994.  As a 6 year old van, it is still great and still has fairly low miles on it.
As with any vehicle, if you take good care of it, it will take care of your needs.  My father takes good care of any vehicle he own's and they last him as long as he needs or until he trades them in.<br><br>
