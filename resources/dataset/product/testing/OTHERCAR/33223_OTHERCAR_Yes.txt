            Picture this, your driving down a country backroad on a cool autumn evening.  The moon roof in your car is open, the cool breeze from the country fresh air is flowing around in the car.  You drive by a group of children playing football in a local park.  The game pauses as everyone stops to look at the car of which you are behind the wheel.  You increase the volume of the CD player and you hear life-like sound radiate from the premium sound system........... May I remind you that you are not in a sports car.  You are in an economy car.  If thats economy I 'd hate to see sport.  The Honda Accord is the Sleekest, most Spacious car in its class.  Its also one of the my reliable cars on the market.  If the oil is changed on time (every 3000 miles), your Honda will be on the road well over 300,000 miles.  All in all its the best car for your money.
