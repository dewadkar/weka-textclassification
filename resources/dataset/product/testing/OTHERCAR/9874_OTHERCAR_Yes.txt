            We've had our new Grand Am for about 6 weeks now and it's been doing great! After totalling our 97 Grand Am (which, by the way, did an excellent job in the crash...it kept us totally safe and after doing 3 360's on a wet highway and slamming into the guard rail, the cups were still in the cupholders...impressive!) we got this new one and like the little innovations.

The dash is very sculpted and the numbers easy to read. When you get close to an empty tank, the car chimes to let you know it. The driver's side windshield wiper is a lot longer than the other one, so when you're driving in rain, it clears away more so that the driver can see better. The ignition is located on the front dash also, so you don't have to lean over, trying to find the keyhole. Also in the dash are 3 center air vents, which really helps the folks in the back seat get cool or warm quicker. 

The keyless remote entry works great and it's so nice to run to your car in the rain and not have to wait there to unlock the car...it's unlocked with you get to it. It also helps when your hands are full of groceries and you need to open the trunk. The trunk has plenty of space and the rear seats fold down when you have to carry long things.

Ours has a sunroof. It's not the type that slides back into the roof, but comes up over the top. Sometimes those can look kinda tacky, but this one looks sleek. We also have the leather. I've experience good and bad things with leather. I really hate it when you're in a hot car and your legs stick to the leather. But this leather has little air holes in it that helps it breath and I haven't had that happen yet.

The Monsoon sound system is incredible as well. Our car stereo sounds better than the Panasonic Home Entertainment Center we just bought! There's the typical CD changer in the dash, but that could easily be upgraded to a CD changer for the trunk. And, for some unknown reason, they're still putting a cassette in the car. Does anybody still use those?

One last plus of this car is the Ram Air. My fiance is the sports-car lover but hates the little bit of room you get in them. This car gives you a sporty look and drive but has plenty of room for passengers (we got the 4 door). The Ram Air kicks into gear when you're going about 55/60 and have to gun it. The holes in the nose of the car suck in the air, ram it into the engine and really give you a boost. This car has not failed our performance expectations for city or highway driving and I doubt it will. The engine is great and has plenty of get up and go. There is a little highway noise, it's not a soundless car. But at the same time, I kinda like hearing the engine working...it sounds powerful.

One warning - when you're filling up the car, make sure you screw on the gas cap tight...give it a full 3-4 turns after it starts clicking. The first time we filled up the car from the dealership I guess my fiance didn't quite screw it in enough and we promptly got the service engine light. Since all these new cars are so computerized, the emissions detector thought we should have screwed it on tighter because it doesn't want any fumes leaking out. Although I'm sure this is a good thing, it can be a pain. It just entails going back to the dealership, getting them to hook up the computer and push one button to reset it. No big deal...but just beware.

The Grand Am GTs only come in 4 colors - white, black, red and silver. The smaller-engined SE's have more colors to choose from.

We got the car from Coggin Pontiac in Jacksonville (on the Southside). It was the easiest, friendliest car-buying experience that we've ever had. Kelly Pontiac (in Orange Park) is another story. They seem quite ignorant about the cars themselves and refused to push that little button to reset the computer due to the emissions. Your Pontiac is supposed to be serviced at ANY Pontiac in the country, no matter what, but the General Manager there is NOT a good businessman and refused to do so because we didn't buy the car there. Coggin, on the other hand, is excellent. If you're in Jax or close by and want a Pontiac, go there!
