            the 1995 eldorado is one of the most solid cars ever produced. the driver has absolute control over the car at all times.  the cornering and acceleration are truely spectacular as well. it is a great car to go fast in, as i have done many times.  the driver retains complete control even at extremely high rates of speed.  although cadillac is considered by many to be an old mans car, anybody will feel at home behind the wheel of the eldorado.  the many luxuries this car offers include heated seats, power everything, in dash cd, dual climate control, and lots of power under the hood.  if you ever have the chance to purchase this car used it is a very wise investment.  the car needs very little service and the powerful northstar engine will keep you moving for some time to come.<br><br>
