            Please don't let the very poor marketing of this awesome vehicle scare you away. Go to a dealer and let them show you the many options you never knew you needed included on the Aztek! Did you know: Radio controls are available in the rear of the vehicle? The tailgate features cupholders and built-in seats? When carrying a heavy load, the vehicle raises it's frame automatically to compensate? A TENT is available for the rear? You cannot break the air vents? A COOLER is available for the front?  The camping package includes a full sized self inflating matress? 4 wheel drive is available for a bit extra, but depending on your use of the vehicle it may not be necessary. The V6 engine is enough for the vehicle and a small boat or twin jet skiis, because the vehicle is very light.
