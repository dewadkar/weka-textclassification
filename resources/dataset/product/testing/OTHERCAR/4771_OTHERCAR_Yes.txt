            What a tremendous vehicle. A4, 1.8 Turbo, Tiptronic.
I am currently about a year and a half through a three-year lease, and I am absolutely thrilled with this car.
Stylish body, good gas mileage on the highway. Aggressive accelleration is powerful. The smooth ride seems to pull the car forward, begging for to go faster. Even at 75-80 mph, the car offers a smooth, quiet ride. It wants to go fast.
Sport package makes a difference, with a lower chassis and sportier rims.
The A4 performs well in the wet, and is fine in the snow, too.
Handles like a charm, even at high speeds. Hugs the curves and sticks to the ground.
Lots of room for 5 people. Spacious trunk.
Cold weather package is worth it, if not for the heated seats alone.
I would highly reccommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
