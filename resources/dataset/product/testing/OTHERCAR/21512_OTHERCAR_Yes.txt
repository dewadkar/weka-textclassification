            I've been a Volkswagen driver for years, and my current car (which was leased through my boss' company) is no reason to change brands. We're talking here about a Golf IV 1.9 TDI (110 hp), in metallic black. 

Driving this baby is a breeze: power steering makes it possible to use just one hand (which you shouldn't), and the powerful diesel outperforms many gasoline cars. The stick shift is quite slick, although some stick positions may be a bit close for average people (heard this from someone who borrowed it from me). 

The hatchback design and the 2-part foldable back seat facilitate the transportation of huge objects, and I don't ever want to switch to a sedan again. 

There's nothing about it that I hate, because the behavior on the road is very forgiving, and warns in advance if you are asking too much of it, so you can compensate before it's too late...

It's an ideal family car, although some may prefer the 5 door version. <br><br>
