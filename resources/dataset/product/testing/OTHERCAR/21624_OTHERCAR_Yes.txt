            I've got a 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  It is a great car.  I love the features. The leather seats are plush and very comfortable.  The built in computer thing is very helpful and neat.  It handles well without much body roll in cornering.  It has great pickup and is very quick for an SUV.  It looks great too.  The problem lies in the maintenance.  The antenna broke off after it got hit by a tree.  To replace the telescopic antenna it costs about $400.  This is pretty crazy.  It has had it's share of problems too.  The transmission had to be replaced and a few other minor problems have occurred.  It also comes with great speakers, Infinity, it sounds really good.If you don't mind spending the money to get it fixed it's a really nice car to have.<br><br>
