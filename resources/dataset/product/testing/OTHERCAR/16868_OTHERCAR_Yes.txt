            I promise, this will be the final installment of the 'Dark Topaz Car Buying & Selling' saga.  It will be the last for now least, because this review is about my current car.  

I have already talked about three of the other vehicles I've owned in the past 14 years and of the three, my current car is somewhat of an enigma to me.  Don't get me wrong, I know a lot about the 1990 Nissan Maxima, (mine came with a 165 hp V6 engine, rear spoiler, four wheel anti-lock disc brakes, black leather interior, a Bose AM/FM cassette stereo, power windows, power door locks, power exterior mirrors, and a power moonroof.  Sometimes, I have to give thanks for having a mechanic and a car lover for a father, because that mechanical passion is definitely in the genes *grin*), but this car has helped me realize that some sedans are not all that bad.  Let me explain.  

When I first saw this style of Maxima, it was back in 1989 when this 3rd generation Maxima first hit the streets.  At that time, my dad owned a 1989 charcoal gray SE Maxima, straight off the showroom floor.  At first, when I saw this car, I scowled at its four doors, stating that it is just another sedan, and even though he may love those four-door family cars I still have no love loss for them.  I told my father I will just stick with my pickup, thank you very much, and that was that.  It wasn't until a few months later, when I had the opportunity to actually use the car to run an errand or two, I realize then that the engineers at Nissan did a really good job with this car especially in the performance department.  Back in 1985, when the Maxima first became a performance sedan, I was impressed with its power and its capability in the " highway slalom " department of weaving in and out of traffic.  (yeah, I know.....Bad DT.  You would not be the first to shake a finger at me for my driving behavior.) Four years later, the redesigned Maxima didn't really get a big boost in the horsepower department, but believe it or not this car was quicker, probably due to better gear ratios and the aerodynamics.  All I know is the result was rather pleasing to my acceleration crazed mentality.  At any rate, all I knew is that this car felt really good.  

After my quick errand jaunt, I had to take another look at the Maxima's appearance as well.  The 85 - 88 Maxima has a very distinct boxy sedan shape, whereas the 1989 to 1994 Maximas have a sleeker, sexier, more seductive look to them.  The body lines are smoother, more than likely made to attract a younger crowd as well as cut down on wind resistance.  The one thing I had realized about the car, is that even though it is a four-door car, it looks very much like a two door sedan or coupe.  Just like Nissan's four-door Pathfinders, they blend the rear two doors in rather well, and it has a really nice rear spoiler, giving the car very sporty look.  After giving it second, more thorough look, I realize that this is a car I could probably see myself owning in the future.  Who knew that at the time I was actually predicting the future....... 

11 years later, I found myself in a nice, black Nissan 4x4, and for the most part life was pretty good from a driver's standpoint.  However, there are a few quirks of owning a four-wheel-drive vehicle.  Trucks and sport-utility vehicles with big tires get horrendous gas mileage, so using one as a daily driver can become quite expensive.  Also, as I said in my truck's review, the Nissan trucks with big tires tend to be fairly slow in both takeoff and and they don't have a very high top speed.  As a result, my daily commute on I-70 (there's a point on this highway where the speed limit reaches 75 MPH) and E-470 (a 70 MPH toll highway *growl*) became both stressful to the pickup as well as my pocketbook.  I knew I had to find an alternative.  I talked to my Dad about seeing if he could find me a 1991 to 1994 Nissan Sentra SE-R (what can I say, I am still a die-hard two door coupe fan) but he informed me the only car that was for sale was a 1990 Maxima.  I figured I would take this car out for a spin and at least give the car a chance.  

My Maxima is a SE model with bright white exterior with a black leather interior, and right away I noticed that the two rear doors once again blended in really well with the rest of the car.  I slipped in behind the wheel, and proceeded as if I were driving to work.  Immediately I realized that this car is as fast as I remembered and there was one thing new that I found out, it is also very quiet at high speeds.  Unlike the 86 Maxima I owned, the 90 Maxima does not have the adjustable suspension, but it really doesn't need it, for cornering and high-speed maneuvers were crisp and precise.  Pretty soon, I was kickin' in the cruise control, tuning in my favorite station on the Bose stereo system, and relishing in the fact that this is one really nice car.  By the time I returned back, I was convinced that I will once again own a sedan.  That was January of last year, and a year later I still think it is one of the best cars I've ever owned.  

In conclusion, the 1990 Nissan Maxima should appeal to a wide range of people.  For the younger generation, it's looks very contemporary for an 11 year-old car.  For those with small families, it is a sedan, making it a really nice family car.  And if you are like me, a person that has a need for reliable transportation, yet also has that " need for speed ", and you want that in a car and have it all rolled up in an affordable package, you need not look any further.  

(By the way, if you were kind enough, and persistent enough to read " the saga " a.k.a. all four of my automotive reviews, I do appreciate it.  *smile*)
