            It all started with lipstick.  

I was cruising ebay looking for a less expensive source for "designer" lipstick.  Page after page, I flipped through pictures of blurry fascimiles of what the auctioneers had for sale.  

I was about to decline the invitation to participate in the lively interchange of the auctions, when it happened.

The last page I turned to had the most beautiful photo of lipstick I had ever seen.  The focus was sharp and the lighting was unbelievable.  I could see each glimmer of mica in the lipstick with amazing clarity.

I wanted that lipstick.  I wanted that camera.

I wrote to the woman who was hosting that auction, and she promised to tell me what camera she was using.  I was never interested in purchasing a digital camera before, being completely unimpressed with the quality.

This woman changed my perception of digital cameras forever.


<b>WHAT MADE ME DECIDE ON THIS CAMERA (STORYTIME)</b>

I did not hear from this woman, and after a while, the drive hit me to search for this camera.  So armed with my trusty tube of new lipstick in that same color I had seen on the auction page, I hit Best Buy to begin my quest.  

I had no idea how to use the cameras, but I bugged everyone that would listen to me to get help.  I took photos of lipstick with every camera.  I know that they thought I was nuts, but I HAD to find the camera that captured that lipstick so beautifully.

Camera after camera was tried, but I just was not impressed.  My husband met me at the shelf.  The two of us were so intent on these cameras, that we did not notice the television crew that came over next to us.  

A woman in a dark suit was standing next to our cart where our little whirlwind toddler was playing with the video cameras.  When the woman stood too close, our daughter slapped her and pushed her away.  I absently scolded her but she persisted, until the suited woman left what she had considered to be her territory.

It was the last time that our daughter protested invasion of her space that I noticed that they were in the middle of filming a piece for the news- I tried to hide as I recognized the woman who invaded our daughter's space as the long time anchorwoman of the news.  

My husband was so intense on the camera, that he completely missed the whole thing.  I was so embarrassed that I tried to run away, but my husband persisted in analyzing this camera.  The quest was now his mission.

As I whirled about searching in vain for a place to hide, he hollered out," THIS IS IT!  I FOUND IT!"

Ever notice that when you want desperately to disappear, that you only manage to draw attention to yourself.........?

I was torn between bolting for cover, and seeing what he had found.  Curiosity won over my embarrassment, and I saw with a thrill that he had taken a perfect picture of the lipstick.

It was a few moments later when it occurred to me that I was supposed to be hiding, and I noticed the television crew had melted away.

We had found IT- our camera!

<b>WHAT IS THIS CAMERA LIKE?</b>

<b>The SONY MAVICA FD-87</b> is a rather large camera.  It is comfortable to hold, but is a tiny bit larger than the traditional 35 mm.  It does not have a viewfinder, but only a screen with option for natural light or artificial light from the camera to illuminate it.  This is not a pocket camera to tuck away conveniently in your shirt pocket.

This camera takes excellent distance shots and close ups are truly magnificent.  

This model does not work on memory sticks, but on floppy disks- a serious disadvantage in the mind of some people, but not to me.  I LOVE that feature.

This camera has a battery that recharges in the camera while it is plugged in.

It has Digital Zoom of 6X, and is 1.3 megapixels CCD.  


<b>CAMERA FEATURE BREAKDOWN</b>

Here is a list of features of this camera:

<i>BATTERY</i>
This comes with an NP-F330 battery.  This battery is called InfoLITHIUM ( a SONY name).  You insert the battery into the camera and plug in the camera with the enclosed AC adaptor.  The charging time is about 2 1/2 hours to bring it to full charge.  Full charge is about 70 minutes or 750 images.  (640x480 setting normal recording mode).  When charging, if there is a problem with the battery, it will show on the charging light.

There are conflicting listings for capacity of the battery.  Using the optional NP-F550 battery with longer life, you can get up to 1600 shots or 2.5 hours of battery life.  Of course, that is with the flash off too...... I found this on the box to be a bit misleading- unless you read the small print.  

<i>AUTO POWER-OFF FUNCTION</i>
If you do not use the camera for three minutes, it turns off automatically to save battery life.

<i>POWER SWITCH</i>
The power switch is a sliding lever on the back of the camera below the screen.  It has a safety switch that needs to be impressed at the same time the lever is slid over to turn it on.  

<i>CONTROL BUTTON</i>
This button is like that four directional button on gamepads for the computer.  You can press it in four directions, each one using different functions.  Almost all functions go through this button.  

<i>SHUTTER BUTTON</i>
On front of the camera in the usual place.  This button can be pressed down half way to lock in the focusing feature.  Then the button can be pressed full way to take the picture or released to cancel the settings.  

<i>ZOOM LEVER</i>
Lots of options to zoom into the subject up to 6 times.  There is wide angle and telephoto setting.  The zoom does deteriorate picture quality depending on the settings.

<i>TRIPOD RECEPTACLE</i>
Takes tripod with length of 6.5mm or 7/32in.  

<i>Lens Cap</i>
On a cord, the cap stays with the camera to be replace while not used.

<i>STRAP</i>
For shoulder carrying.  

<i>PLAY/STILL SELECTOR</i>
Sets for either looking at the photos taken, or active setting to take photos.

<i>POWER ON/OFF TO CHARGE LAMP</i>
This controls the light that illuminates the viewing screen.  If you are in bright sunlight, turning this off saves battery time and allows natural illumination of the screen.  You can also control brightness of the light on camera here.  

<i>BUTTON CONTROLS</i>
THere are buttons for FOCUS (changes the closeness of target, or can be set to automatic), FLASH BUTTON (on or off), PROGRAM AE BUTTON (four settings for twilight, twilight plus, landscape, pan focus)  

<i>SELF TIMER</i>
This camera has a switch on the front that you can self time with.  You press a button on the back to set it up and then the timer switch is on the front.  Once pressed, you have about 25 seconds.

<i>FLOPPY PORT</i>
This area is for a 3.5 floppy disk.  Depending on the setting for the photos you can fit from 3 to 12 photos typically on a disk.  The photos are recorded in .jpg format and do not need a special program to be seen and used on the computer.

<b>MY REACTION TO THIS CAMERA</b>

As an artist, I find it very important to have a lot of reference photos for developing paintings.  I found that this camera takes the most unbelieavable close ups of any camera I have ever used.  

The photos are crisp and very clear when taken in larger resolutions.  

<b>WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS CAMERA</b>
The close ups
The ease of use
Quickness of photo recording on disc
Handiness of discs
Easy to take self photos (If I want to do self portraits reference photos)
Self Timer plenty of time
Excellent flash
Focus detail exceptional
Quality of photo is exceptional for midrange camera


<b>WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS CAMERA</b>
Sometimes the control four way button is tricky to press just right
Camera lens cap on cord gets in the way sometimes
Wish camera came with case
Battery life with LCD light on is rather short
No viewfinder, just screen
Sometimes autofocus is tricky to get to work well


<b>ADDITIONAL ACCESSORIES</b>
I really like the fact that you can use disks with this and not have to have special software to extract them from the disk.  However, on a long trip, it is nice to know that you can have an adaptor for memory stick added to the camera.  It is about $70 or so and is shaped like a floppy disk with a receptacle for the memory stick in it.

I do notice that the photos take about double the time to record on the memory stick than they do on disks.  Rapid shots are not possible.

There is also another battery with longer life available for this camera, and the next model up has just the memory stick alone with the floppy socket seperate.  It is another $100 and not worth the price for me.  However, others might not feel that way.   The FD-87 camera was already $400 as it was, adding another $100 was a bit too much for us at the time.  

There is also a special case available for this camera, but I bought a simple VIDEO CAM case which works just fine for about half of the price. 

There is also a filter kit available for this camera. (VF-37PK S)


<b>CLOSING COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION</b>

Although the camera is not the most fantastic to carry and easy to use, I find it to be a quality that is beyond what I imagined digital cameras could achieve.  The close up quality is worth any inconvenience.  I really am impressed with the photo quality and the way that they print out as real photos would on photo paper with the HP 990CSE. 

I am a very picky person when it comes to photos. 

The sharpness is fantastic and the detail in closeups is impressive for such a mid range camera.  

I do not mind the floppies and switching them is not a problem.  However, the adaptor for long vacations or trips is available, and it is easy to use, but takes longer.  

Because the picture quality is so far beyond that of any other camera I have seen in this price range, I am giving it 5 stars.  However, it is not small or as easy to use as some of the very expensive ones may be.  

I feel that the photo quality - especially the close ups- is so high, that I can only rate it 5 stars.


<b>EPILOGUE</b>

After we had purchased and used this camera for a few weeks, I eventually did hear from the woman who took the lipstick pictures.

It turns out that she had....
......The SONY MAVICA FD-87 !!!  

Apparently she gets numerous requests about her camera due to the exceptional pictures she displays.  I can see why!
