            I bought a Dodge Durango after looking at all the other models out there in the SUV area.  I have a family of 5 , 3 of them children.  Ranging in ages of 4 to 9 yrs old.  How you ever tried to go on a vacation trip with kids these ages sitting next to each other.  With in the first 5 minutes of the trip , they are all over each other.  With the Durango and its third seat way in the back.  The problem was solved.  For my wife , it just the right size for her to drive and fell comfortable.  For me, I love power and this truck has it.  I have never own anything but cars and Vans in the past.  I will not go back to driving a car ever again.  Besides, the Durango drives just like a car.  The vehicle solved all our automobile problems.  Kids have plenty of room, Mom loves driving it, and I have my powerful off road truck that drives like a car.  Not only that, but it is a beautiful , eye catching vehicle.  I chose the dark blue color.  I would recommend this to anyone, it is fun to drive. <br><br>
