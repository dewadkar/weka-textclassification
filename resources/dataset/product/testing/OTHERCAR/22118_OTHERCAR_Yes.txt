            My husband and I have been looking for a digital camera for a long time, and we are so pleased with this one.  The man who sold it to us warned me that the picture quality might not be as high as I was expecting, but the &quot;best&quot; quality pictures are excellent.  The &quot;good&quot; and &quot;better&quot; quality aren't as sharp, but they're adequate for things like online auctions or emailing pictures.

I'm not a technical person, and I was easily able to figure out how to take pictures, upload them to the computer and send them.  The manual is well-written and the camera is intuitive -- what you need to do makes sense.

A couple of cautions -- using the viewfinder a lot just burns up the batteries.  I found an AC adapter at WalMart that works great and saves the batteries.  Also, if you use the &quot;best&quot; quality picture setting, you'll only be able to save about 20 pictures on the memory card.  On a recent vacation without a computer, that wasn't enough for me.  I'll be buying another card before we go again.

This is just a great camera.  <br><br>
