            I Purchased a 1996 Honda Civic Ex.  It now has 40,000 miles on it and I have had no problems at all.  The car responds exactly as I expected, it is reliable and the quality is unsurpassed.  When I decided a compact would suit my needs I looked and compared the Civic to the Saturn. (I would not even consider Ford or Chrysler) The Saturn was good but it was not as good as the Civic.  The Saturn was louder in the interior and did not handle as nice as the Civic.  The other great point about the Civic is that is is build in Ohio.  I had the priveledge to visit the plant(after my purchase) and was totally impressed.  One thing that I found out is that they do not work Overtime at the plant.  When the shift is over the line stops and the workers go home.  I think this helps their quality since workers are not overtired.   <br><br>
