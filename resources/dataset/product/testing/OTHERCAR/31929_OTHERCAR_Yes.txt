            After testing out the CRV, RAV4, the Tribute, and the Forester, we liked the Forester's handling and features the best and test drove twice before deciding to buy. I've been very pleased with its roadworthiness, comfort, climate controls, the huge sunroof, the 6-CD player, and have often taken advantage of the heated side mirrors to clear fog. It's not the peppiest car (I drove an Outback loaner that felt much more powerful but had a rear view totally blocked by back headrests and also felt very low to the ground), but I knew that going in. I was, however, disappointed with the mileage, which hovers around 25mpg.

We have not experienced previously mentioned problems with the brakes. I've had to stop short in traffic on many an occasion and had no difficulty.  We did have a problem with the A/C condensation draining into the passenger compartment and onto our feet. Two trips to the dealership finally cleared it up, but in the meantime we had a bit of a swampy ride.

The flimsy and non-adjustable cup holder that hangs in front of the ventilation controls is the worst feature of this car. 

We drive to ME and NH ski country frequently in the winter, so I'm looking forward to the snow experience. Since this car was purchased in April, we've only enjoyed the AWD in bad rainstorms and haven't seen what it can do on snow. I'm also planning to enjoy the heated seats when traveling with my husband. He doesn't believe in turning on the heat!

Update in July 2002: the A/C condensation drain still backs up, and I was advised that it's a design flaw of the 2001 Forester. I would be interested to hear if others experienced the same problem. Still enjoying the car, no other problems!
