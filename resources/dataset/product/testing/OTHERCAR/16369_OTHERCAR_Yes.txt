            I've had my c200 for about 8 months, got it at Best Buy for $300 with an extra 16 MB memory card for free.  I hated having to get my photos developed from old-style film.  With this bad boy, you just snap your pix, save 'em to your computer, and email 'em, print 'em, or post 'em on a web site somewhere.  

The memory cards are reuseable and you NEVER have to go to a film developer again!  Here's the deal... the 4 MB card that comes with it will hold about 20 normal resolution pix, twice as many low-rez pix, and half as many high-rez pix.  The serial interface that comes with it and the software needed to use it both suck.  The serial port is slow, REALLY wastes batteries in the camera, and uses this stupid software that makes you sit there and wait for all the pix to transfer to your hard drive.If you get this camera, buy a Lexar memory card reader... it's about $40, but reads the pictures 10 times faster, doesn't use the camera's batteries while you download pix, and uses a drive letter on your computer to access the pix individually rather than all at once.  Awesome.

One other thing I don't like is the fact that the LCD screen's refresh is &quot;jerky&quot;.  What I mean is any perceived motion on the screen is very not-smooth.  Other than that, the camera has great features at a great price.  The high-rez setting is way higher than anything you'll want to send in email, so use the medium or low setting.  There's a red-eye reduction feature, timer thingy, even tripod mount.
