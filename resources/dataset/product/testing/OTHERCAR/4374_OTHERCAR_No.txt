            Last month, I traveled to Monroe, Louisiana for 10 days on business. I rented a 2001 Kia Sportage with about 6,000 miles on it for the duration of the trip.  Okay, 10 days is hardly a huge amount of time, and God knows, rental cars are treated like they're disposable by a lot of people, but Jeez, this is a cheap SUV!  And it only had 6K miles on it!  I shudder to think what condition it'll be in at 20K miles.

A friend of mine has had a Sportage for 2-3 years, and she loves the darn thing.  I'll grant you, it's kinda cute in a girlie kind of way.  I actually like the styling better than my Subaru Forester.  The Kia feels pretty roomy, it has better cup holders (an important consideration for Americans, who tend to use their cars as alternative dining rooms), and it's pretty inexpensive--which matters to me because I refuse to spend more money on a car than I would on a house.  But, unfortunately, beyond those factors I wouldn't recommend the Kia.

I've driven my friend Kathy's Kia many times when she visits (I'm always her 'designated driver'), and although she loves hers, she also drives like a grandma (a very slow grandma) and doesn't mind the fact that it has absolutely no pickup at all.  She also drives all of 3 miles to work every day, so if her Kia has more than 20K miles I'd be surprised. And her Kia is always garaged. So, if your Sportage will be treated the same, maybe you're a prime candidate for this SUV.  However, if you're like me and have no garage, a lead foot and average 50-60 miles a day--stay far, far away!

The Kia Sportage I rented in Monroe, LA looked nice enough.
I wasn't nuts about the swing-open rear door with the spare on it, though. I could see that thing catching a gust of wind and whomping into the next car if you weren't careful. The design of the door is pretty cumbersome, too. You have to use two hands to close the door--one to press the lever than unlocks the door from the open position and the other to swing the door.  A pain if you're unloading groceries and it's raining or the ground is wet. You'd have to set all the bags down on the ground to maneuver the door. The back of the SUV is also a little high--if you're short like me and trying to load a whopper of a suitcase in the back, good luck trying to lift it up there.  The cargo space was just okay, not particularly roomy.  The Forester has spoiled me in this area.  The Kia's cargo area was no bigger than the average car trunk.  You can fold down the rear seats to get more room, but now you've turned it into a two-seater.  Generally, you should be able to fit 4 four people and their luggage into even a small SUV, and I don't believe the Kia would be able to do that.

The back seat looked roomy enough. And having ridden in the back seat of Kathy's Kia, I found the seats comfy enough as well.  Roomy is a relative term, however.  I am only 5 feet tall, so most vehicles are plenty roomy for me.  I don't think many small SUV's (including my Forester) would be terribly comfortable for most people over 5'7".  However, in the Kia the rear seats are set up pretty high in the back, which, depending on your tolerance for exhibitionism, can be a good or a bad thing for a woman in a skirt.

The front seats are pretty comfortable, although there's not much adjustment you can do for height.  The steering wheel did not adjust, either.  The dash has fairly primitive dial-type controls, easy to figure out but not many bells or whistles. The radio/CD player was good, although I didn't have any CDs to try out since it was a business trip. 

Nope, no major problems with the exterior or interior design of the Kia.  It was the performance that sucked!  I do not know the horsepower of the Kia's engine.  I'm estimating it to be maybe 25hp (yes, that is a joke...).  You had to stomp on the gas, wait for a bit (keep stomping) and THEN the engine would finally kick in.  Which made highway entrances memorable, to say the least.  And for a small SUV with a little bitty engine, the Kia wasn't particularly stingy with the gas.  Mine got maybe 17-18 mpg, which is not very good for such a small SUV. I'm not a big fan of having to switch into 4-wheel-drive, either.  You don't always have time to stop before you need 4-wheel drive, and if Subaru can invent All-Wheel-Drive all the time, surely Kia can come up with something similar.  AWD has been around awhile--have they heard of reverse engineering???

My lovely Kia also rattled horribly while idling, which are probably some loose brackets.  Easily fixed, but at 6 thousand miles should this already be a problem?  Even people riding to lunch with me asked me if I knew this SUV was a piece of s**t. You could hear me coming from miles away. The only good thing I can say about performance was that the air conditioning worked pretty well--a big plus when you're in Louisiana in June and your car has been baking in a sunny parking lot for 10 hours.  

I didn't find the Kia handled all that well for its size.  It had a small turning radius, which made turning around easy, because I did a lot of that while trying to read maps in Louisiana.  But, near the end of my trip, while following a logging truck on a two-lane highway, I had reason to wish the handling was better.  I was following the truck from a pretty long distance, because it had been dropping bark chips, etc.  But I moved up somewhat to pass it, and of course, right then the truck decided to drop part of a tree in the road.  When I stepped on the brakes and tried to swerve around the log, I felt a pronounced 'lean' in the body, and I knew I couldn't swerve any farther and keep the Kia on the road.  I hit the log.  I don't know for certain that I could have avoided the log in my Forester, but I'm pretty sure I could have.  I feel much more secure in that SUV, particularly on cornering.  By the way, hitting a log in a rental car where your company doesn't pay for supplemental insurance and you are working with both your personal and business insurance companies and dealing with an independent trucker that the Louisiana State Police have had to track down by license plate number is not a good way to end a business trip!  Particularly when a day after you get back from that you have to leave for a week on your own vacation (a cruise--more on that in another epinion...).

Bottom line--I know the Kia Sportage is an inexpensive SUV, but I think you get what you pay for.  I would spend a few thousand more and buy a Subaru Forester, a Toyota RAV-4 or a Honda CRV instead.  Your resale value will be markedly higher with any of these models.  I don't think the Kia will be very durable in the long run (or in my case, even the short run!), and I know from experience that this Kia is not much fun to drive.
