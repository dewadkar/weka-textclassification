            bought the 2001 s-10 extended cab a couple of months ago. has all the goodies on it. electric locks, windows, cd stereo with auto volume control, v-6, auto, bucket seats and air. about the only thing it lacks is the sliding rear window. has a lot of zip to it. the ride is a little stiff, but handles good. gas mileage could be a little better. i am getting about 19 mpg combined highway and city. the seats are comfortable. the third door is nice to have. makes it easy to get in and out of behind the seats. really enjoy driving this vehicle. took it on a 300 mile trip and did not get fatigued driving it. cruise control worked excellent
