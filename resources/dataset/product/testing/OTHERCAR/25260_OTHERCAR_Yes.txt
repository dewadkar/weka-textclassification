            With all the redesigns, enhancements and refinements that the 2000 Nissan Altima received, there is not much left to do in the 2001 Nissan.  Well, there were a few touches here and there in terms of color remix and other insignificant works.  That's why I will encourage anybody who wants to buy a 2000 Nissan if he/she doesn't care that much about the GXE Limited Edition Package's features.

<b>Available models</b>

The Altima is available in the following models:  XE, GXE, SE and GLE.  You can choose between the five-speed manual transmission and the 4-speed electronically controlled transmission.  The 2001 Nissan Altima is the offspring of the 2000 Nissan which received styling modifications, noise reduction, vibration improvements, more than a dozen comfort and convenience enhancement touches and improved suspension system.  It makes sense that this new, redesigned vehicle can handle the road without any problems.  While I was test-driving the GXE Limited Edition, I realized how smooth the ride was.  It was so much fun to hit the freeway on an afternoon when the Sierra Summit Crest could be seen from the Central Valley floor.  The howling winds and ensuing pelting rains of the night before provided us with such a natural spectacle.
I grew up driving a Datsun truck.  I knew how harsh it was at times.  Driving in the back country of some Caribbean countries where the roads were not asphalted had its charms and perils.  Any way, this 2001 Nissan Altima is pure luxury in comparison.  I know it is not a fair one.

This vehicle is very roomy.  I fit in my 6'5" frame without any problems.  I truly enjoyed the 8-way power driver's seat.  I was able to adjust it to my comfort.  Bye bye leg cramps.  In the back seat, long-legged people can sit comfortably.  If you have children on each side, you can always put the car seat in the middle.  Baby will be happy to see what's around.  

<b>Features and options</b>

The 2001 Nissan Altima comes ready with all the standard features.  But the only thing I don't like on the other models is the fact the airbags are offered as options.  Depending on the models you get, you can see lots of differences. As other options, you can have 4-wheel antilock brakes, power glass, and front side-air bags.  No matter what, all models come equipped with power windows, dual power mirrors, tilt-steering column, rear defroster and in-glass radio antenna, dual front air bags, ignition immobilizer anti-theft system with security indicator light, and side-door beams etc.  It's like the 2001 Honda Civic.  This is great, after all.  You don't want to invest so much money into a car that is going to be stolen by any debutant thief.  Rest assured that your investment is going to be protected.

I don't want to mention that you will be attracted to the exterior.  Colors were part of the 2001 touches to the Nissan Altima.  Now that you have the information, go ahead and make up your mind.
