             Hi there, about three years ago my wife said she was tired of piling the family into our Dodge Omni,  said she wanted a mini van, so since I worked at a dodge dealership from 1987 to 1990 I had a good idea about what type of vehicle to look for. I am an automotive technician and have had a chance to work on just about every make and model vehicle made. So I hope my opinion means a little something to someone. We bought the 1990 Dodge Caravan with a little over 150k miles for about $2000. Since then we have been tickled pink with it, my wife wouldn't trade it for the world. She loves it's powerful 3.3L engine, and the 24 MPG it gets on the highway. I loved driving it so much I bought a 1987 same color, model, and everything. I love it to death, being a mechanic I don't get time to work on my own vehicles very often. You know the saying,&quot;A mechanic's vehicle is always in the worst condition&quot;, well that's only partly true. With these mini vans I don't have to spend much time working on them, I.E. low maintenance vehicle. I also use it to haul just about anything I can think of, washing machine,stove. For the money you cant beat the caravan, it comes with more options  than you could ever imagine using. We used our vans to move everything we own into our new home, no moving van rentals required! They have plenty of power as well as good gas mileage, you just can't beat that. The seats in the back are up high enough for the kids to see out the windows even in there car seats. When on long trips any parent knows that entertained child is a happy child, that's real important for a parent sanity on the road. There is also enough room between the front seats for one of those portable TV VCR  center consoles. All in all I have to say my family loves our minivans!<br><br>
