            In 1996 my family purchased a 1993 Pontiac Grand Am SE at a used car dealership just outside of Dillsburg. It had about 74,000 miles on it and when I first sat down in the comfortable interior I could tell immediately that it was well-built and definitely superior to the Ford Tempo my dad had just taken for a test drive. Now we're nearing the end of the century, and the Grand Am has never let us down. It did have a faulty battery that needed replacing, but it has never overheated or broken down. Since we have to travel at least a half hour to go to the nearest shopping mall, we've racked up many miles on the Grand Am. A little over 131,000 miles, to be exact. The interior is still in remarkably good condition, with very little wear, with the backseats having plenty of leg room, and the engine (a powerful V-6) is still in excellent condition. The car itself still has the pickup it was made with, and continues to be a reliable and comfortable drive.<br><br>
