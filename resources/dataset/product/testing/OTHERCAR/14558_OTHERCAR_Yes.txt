            I bought my 1996 Convertible Celica GT new in July, 1996.  I have 85,600+ miles on it and it has been great!  I had my first repair last month and it was minor.  The cable in the retracting antena had to be replaced but my extended warranty paid for it.  Maintenance is minimal, just keep up the oil changes every 5K miles.  I am finally due for my first brake work.  Mechanics say they like to work on these because they are so easy.  I can take it anywhere to be worked on.
I have owned other convertibles but this is my first electric one.  If it's a nice day and I'm stopped at a light or in traffic I can just press a button and the top goes back (you only need to make sure you are in first gear if you have a manual, which I have).  The car always looks good.  My dogs like it too.  I have 2 large Akitas that have both fit in the back seat and enjoyed the ride. If the trunk is too small for something you can just pop the top and put the item in the back seat.   I plan to drive this one well over 100K miles.
