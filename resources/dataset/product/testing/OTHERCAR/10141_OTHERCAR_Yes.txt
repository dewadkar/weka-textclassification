            The Nissan Pathfinder is a great car with many different features and many different reasons why you should get this car. The Pathfinder is affordable and can take a beating, after beating, and after beating. It is a good Sport Utility Vehicle to take offroad, or maybe to go camping with. And it is priced at a solid affordable price. 

The pathfinder has been around for a while and has always been seen as a solid car, and is always up in popularity. I always see this car on the road, and I myself is thinking of buying one considering that a couple of my friends have this car and love it also.


My friends have this car in automatic transmission, but I might consider getting a manual Truck, because that is the real way to drive, I love it that way, it makes it alot funner! Well I highly recommend this car, because it is relieable, and like I said, it can take a beating, a really bad beating.<br><br>
