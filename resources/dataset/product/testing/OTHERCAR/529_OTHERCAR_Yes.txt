            As this being my first digital camera, I wanted this purchase to be my first and last camera. I simply felt that a cheaper model would grow old and that I would simply want something more powerful. So I chose the Olympus C-2100 ultra zoom. 

At $799, this camera has the most bang for the buck. Being a beginner, its all that I wanted and more. Taking pictures and sending them to the computer is a snap. I use the 640 X 480 resolution for emails and web pictures. I have yet to use a higher resolution. But so far I've taken one pic with a slightly higher resolution and the picture was sharp, crisp and worthy of praise. I've yet to totally test the power of the higher resolutions on scenery from my next trip that I plan to take. 

Being a beginner, I have so far got plenty of use out of the self timer, the macro mode, the apeture settings, zoom, and shutter speeds. This camera has lots of features, some that I may never use, but it is a good feeling to know that they are there, such as the burst mode and the sound recording mode. The zoom in this camera is a significant factor in my purchase. Other cameras for around the same price only had a 3X zoom, while this camera has the 10X zoom which will prove to be useful. 

In the end, I am sure that this camera will continue to impress once I really get to use it well and make thorough use of all its features while out on vacation.
