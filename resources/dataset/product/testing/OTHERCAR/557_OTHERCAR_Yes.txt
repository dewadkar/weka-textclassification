            We bought our second Hyundai in August,1998.
We bought our first Hyundai,Excell in1990 when they went to a fuel injected engine.

We put 140,000 miles on the excell before it developed a major electrical problem that distroyed the on board computer.

I was particularly impressed with the improvement in the visibility,and with the elimination of the terrible wind noise.We could not hear the radio or tapes without maxing out the volume.

Now we can enjoy our tapes, and cds like normal people.

Our accent is a responsive, fun to drive.

We have had no mechanical problems, and expect none,if history is any indication.
