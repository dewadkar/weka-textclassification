            Let me start this review by telling a story and when I'm done, you'll see exactly why I did.

My friend had this camera first.  He took pictures, and no knock on him, they turned out God-awful.  I mean, they were pixelated, washed out, over and under exposed, the whole nine yards.  I on the other hand had an Olympus D-340R, and thought I had the greatest camera in the world.  Long story short, I ended up with the Epson and he ended up buying an Olympus.

I took the camera home and started snapping pictures.  They looked great on the screen, but the minute I downloaded them to my computer I was horrified.  My pictures looked as bad as his did.

After playing with the settings, though (which you'll have to do to get the brilliant images this bad boy is capable of making), this camera takes the best pictures of any digital camera I've seen (so far, anyway) for myself.

The camera's design is extremely comfortable and although it's not a small camera by any means, the shape fits your hands very well.  The buttons are logically placed on the casing of the unit, although the navigation keys to the right of the screen could use some work.  I've seen better.  They require a lot of pressure or pushing them from the right edge in order to do anything on the screen.

The screen is wonderful.  While they offer a &quot;solar assist&quot; feature which lets light in through the top of the LCD to save battery life, it takes about two seconds to realize that this feature is totally useless.  The quality of images on the screen and the contrast/brightness are more than acceptable and are even pretty good in direct sunlight.  For anyone taking any kind of serious pictures, though, use the viewfinder to line up your shots.

The camera also comes with a 3x optical zoom which is quite good.  From the Staten Island Ferry, I can get a very good shot of the Statue of Liberty.  In fact, I have a couple of shots I've taken of the skyline with this camera from quite a distance, but you'd never know.

Top notch picture controls are a great feature of this camera.  You can adjust the exposure, the flash speed, the white balance, and the image quality.  While the camera comes with 8 megabytes of Non-ATA compact flash, you'll be able to get from 18 to 122 pictures depending on the quality setting you choose.

Finally the extras.

The camera does have a Video out RCA connector for hooking up to your television/VCR, and a threaded hole for a standard sized tri-pod, something you'll need for shooting things with the zoom in low light.

Epson includes a couple of good pieces of software with the 750 as well.

1.  A program that you install on your camera to allow you to print directly to your Epson Stylus 750 printer.  I don't really recommend this because you don't have an option to touch the picture up first, but if you need to fire off a quick photo, this is a good way to do it.

2.  The Sierra Imaging software included does a nice job of organizing the images in the camera and is a breeze to use.  You can also use it to set the functions on the camera.

When you include the fact that this camera comes with 4 Nickel Metal batteries, a carrying case, all the software you need, and all the cables you need, it somewhat justifies the hefty price.

While $650 may seem like a lot for a 1.3 megapixel digital camera, in this case you get everything (if not more) than you pay for.<br><br>
