            Let me first say that I like this car.

Okay, now let me tell you that after 110K miles I'm on my second engine, my suspension is totally shot, the little plastic pieces are breaking off of the switches, both driver's side windows are broken, the air conditioner has never worked really well and doesn't work at all now, the transmission needs work and my red car is starting to drift toward orange.

Why then do I still like the car?  It's a big, comfortable car for a long trip.  Your back, legs and...  Ahem...  Other parts, don't ache after sitting in it for a few hours.  It has enough power for any situation.  Personally, I consider it a good value in terms of it's size compared to its cost.

Whether the mechanical difficulties I've suffered are my bad luck or a problem of the breed I couldn't say.  I've had two Chryslers in a row and this may well be my last.  Still, I don't feel as though the money (including repairs) has been wasted and I plan to drive this car for several more years.<br><br>
