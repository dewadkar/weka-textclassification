            It's the little engine that could and did and is still going. Other than being a good value and a practical, efficient people mover, the Civic is...well... rather bland. Personally, that is the only reason why I think the Civic has been so successful.  It's Honda's safe, Go-to Formula.
  My first experience is the venerable 89 Civic, which my sister still owns and drives occasionally.  As any other 16yr old, your first car has certain sentimental value.  The little bugger was loyal, designated wagon, gas-sipper and a great value....samething(s) have been said about the Civic through all it's generations. I recently purchased a slightly-used 2001 Civic EX 5MT......replacing my beloved Nissan 240sx, which has been thoroughly abused.  Nissan's a driver's car.  I needed a "practical, efficient people mover".  Like a dog running back to a doghouse, I returned to the Civic.  

The car hasn't changed much in 11 years.  Sure the dash and interior looks more modern but it shows the basic platform, layout and no-nonsense approach.  I do like the new muffler/downpipe layout that eliminated the middle hump as well as the increased interior headroom.  Driving it however, left me wanting more.  The 127hp V-Tec engine has average acceleration but reminds you that it's an econobox 4 banger when you try to get some juice....just like 11 years ago with 96hp.  The doors on the 01 feel even slimmer, cheaper perhaps?  Honda ergonomics have always receive praises but why does the EX have an armrest as opposed to the center console storage unit?  Why is there only one cupholder in the back? Why does the bloody AC come on when you use defrost?(it a well-meaning but stupid idea.  Robbing precious gas mileage AND make the car slower for "drier air")
I should stop complaining about gas efficiency,  fuel is expensive and it's not Honda's fault.  I am getting close to the advertised 30mpg highway.  City is a different story.
V-Tec is nothing but a badge unless you're driving an SI or a Prelude=).  Racking the Civic up to 6,000 rpms makes the civic lose all the calm, comfy ride that Honda tried to put into the car.  Not very useful in city driving.  Go faster than 85? Gas mileage drop dramatically plus with the car being so light it begins to float.  Passing power comes from the driver and his/her will and perhaps divine intervention.  The engine sounds like it wants to curl into a fetal position and die.
The Civic's looks are decent for an entry level car.  The looks you get while in a Civic however....
The movie Fast and Furious and sequel has spawned a new generation of idiots.  Just because I'm Asian and drive a manual trannsmission import, doesn't mean it's "tricked, sooped-up, nor am I spraying" (it's a 4 door!!) I sure as hell don't want to race you and your "tricked out" vehicle.  If I want to speed, I'll take my 240sx.

Finally, finances.  Honda's have incredible resale value, the prime reason I chose the Civic over it's competitors.
For comparable or less, the Nissan Sentra is also a good deal.  Just don't expect adults to sit in the back.  The Toyota Corolla is a great buy but isn't quite as nimble.  It is however a more robust car.  Feels more like an older, more comfy Camry than a compact... a chauffeur's car.  The VW Golf is fun to drive but way too pricey.  If I had time to wait it out, I would've gone with a leftover Golf/Jetta platform.  If I had purchasing power as opposed to a loan officer from hell, I would have gone with the Subaru Impreza.  I don't need the WRX, the 2.5RS is still a blast.  Road holding is confident, not questionable like in the Civic.  
I don;t love my Civic, I don't hate it either.  However, if Honda doesn't change it's tune soon, the real POS Kia's might sneat the econobox segment from them.
