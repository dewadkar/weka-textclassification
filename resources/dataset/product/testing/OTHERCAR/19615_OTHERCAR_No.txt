            i just bought a new saturn sc2.i thought i got a good price on it, it looks nice.
the problem i have with saturn is that ever since i got it, not a month goes by that its not in the shop for something.  weather its steering, electrical problems and now the most recently, it doesn't start when i want it too.  
i would walk out of the house in the morning to go to work and it won't start.  you can keep cranking over the engine and no start.  after at least ten minutes then it would almost start, then die.  
then when i get off of work. the same damn thing.  i bought a new car cause i wanted the warranty so i don't have to pay every time i take it to the shop.
well i got the warranty i had it for over a year, i had it in the shop just about once a month, and nothing that they fixed was covered under warranty.
well if anyone bye's a saturn, take this as a warning. they say there so good, and great service. thats a bunch of horse crap.  they want your money and that's the bottom line.<br><br>
