            This is a great car.  I have had one for about a year now and it is really driving great.  I often travel on business in this car and I het great comfort for driving it.  I also take it to the country with me when i go hunting and it does great threw mud and muck.  It also has great room to fit kids in the back ,with comfort.  This is a great vehicle for those people who like to ride on the road and offroad.  One bad thing about this car is the air conditioner.  I have had some problems with this but other than that it has been great.<br><br>
