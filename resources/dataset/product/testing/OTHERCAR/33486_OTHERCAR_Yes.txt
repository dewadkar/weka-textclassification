            I purchased my Caravan in 1994 with 78,000 miles on it and now have 151,000.  Generally I am fully surprised and pleased with it's dependability.  It has been in the shop a few times, but never for a major motor or transmission problem.  I have never had an alternator/generator on any previous car last 151,000 miles, till now.  The water pump was replaced at 146,000 miles, a record for me too.  The motor does use about a quart of oil about every two full tanks of gas, perhaps due to the rings loosing their springiness from overheating more than once.  That continues to be a problem, even though this is the second radiator installed.  It will read just below the red on the heat gage when I first take off.  The &quot;check engine&quot; light will come on, I race the engine, and it immediately swings back down to about 1/2.  I believe it is the thermostat which was replaced with the last radiator.  The higher than normal rpm's and water flow probably unstick the thermostat.  I have heard (OK, from one person) that about half the thermostats on the market are faulty.  The last radiator, I was told by the repair person, was leaking.  The first was replaced because it was supposedly plugged.  I never had an overheating problem before that however.  In other words, I don't necessarily believe that.  It was replaced as part of a repair of a wreck I caused.  The left front end was smushed, but the radiator was not really damaged by that.  That is the only crash I have had.  I took the plug wire to the distributor off once and cranked it.  For some reason it didn't want to even fire after that.  Had it towed to the repair shop again.  Can't remember what they replaced.  One other time the fuel injection forced a repair job.  I think they purged the fuel injection.  The front brakes have been replaced by me a little over a 100,000, and maybe by the previous owner, as I seem to remember.  Generally, my brakes last well over a 100,000.  I have a remote start I installed that used to start most every time till I recently shopped it for dying immediately.  The shop replaced the oxygen sensor and it starts immediately if cold, but if warmed up I have to pump the accelerator repeatedly till it goes.  Before the sensor was replaced, I could manage to make it go by pumping furiously on the accelerator, but the engine was very uncontrollable.  Now that I get to writing about all those times in the shop, it does seem like too many, but I never had a bill over $350 or so (excepting the crash of course).  The motor and transmission, as I said, have never had a bolt removed for anything.  The A/C is adequate for the front passenger on a hot day (I know about hot days in Texas), but probably not that good in the rear.  My heat/A/C temperature control slider I had to disconnect because it wasn't functioning properly.  Either I get recirculated air conditioning or outside air with heat (with air if desired to defog the front window).  To repair it, I would have to take off the entire dashboard to get to it.  

Driving the Caravan is very comfortable for me.  I am 6 feet tall and find the drivers seat extremely comfortable for cross country trips.  I have driven it from San Diego to Texas twice.  I have even slept comfortably for a few hours reclined in the seat.  The passenger seat leans back more than the drivers.  Handling is good, as far as I am concerned.  This is the first van I have owned.  Mileage has been as good as expected for a 100 hp, four cylinder engine; about 21-24 on the highway.  Basically, I am satisfied with this American product (really made in Canada though).  I have mostly owned foreign vehicles, Japanese in particular, because they were so dependable and cheap compared to American.  I am proud to say that I believe American manufacturers have finally gotten the message; dependability is more important than anything you can offer on a car.<br><br>
