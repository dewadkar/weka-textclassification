After searching high and low for a minivan that would fit myself, my husband and our two sons who still required car seats, we found the Chevy Venture! It truly has been the best vehicle we have ever owned!
I was first enticed by the automatic sliding door. I thought I was the coolest thing since sliced bread! But then I discovered all of the other cool gadgets and gizmos it had to offer. 
The separate stereo system for rear passengers was ideal because we all know that parents and children do not always agree on music taste. On our trip to FL (from NY) our preschooler listened happily to Sesame Street while we, happily, did not.
Having drink holders in SO many different locations is a great feature! Especially since they can hold not only cans (round shaped containers) but also juice boxes! Great when you have younger children who frequently drink out of them!
Another big bonus was the convertible setting. We chose the 8 passenger seating- 2/3/3 configuration, which has proved to be the best by all means. We are able to move and remove the bucket seats easily to suit our liking. We usually remove the middle seat in the middle row so we can have easy access to the rear row. This was very handy during our vacation to FL, the adult who was not driving could go to the back row and catch a little shut eye or just entertain the kids, if need be.
I have recommended this van to all my friends who were and are shopping for a new family car. I think I may have help influenced one of my friends well, because she wound up buying a Venture herself! I certainly will never go back to a &quot;regular&quot; car.
