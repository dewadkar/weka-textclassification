            I bought my first Chevy Astro van in 1997 (a 1996 used van), and our second one in 1998 (a 1992 used van). Both of the vans have been wonderful! We have 4 little boys so it was essential to have enough room for them all. The Astro is roomy and comfortable, and both of our had 2 bucket seats in front, and 2 benches in back, to seat a total of 8 people comfortably. I like the feature of shoulder belts in the back seats, and the ability for the seat to be folded down or removed for more space. This has been valuable when purchasing large items and when hauling garbage to the landfill. 

Both vans have been very reliable. They have needed only basic maintenance and have not let me down on the road. We get about 24 mpg on the highway and 20 in town. They handle well, are easy to drive, and I get compliments on their nice appearance. They continue to look new even after years of use. 

The vans have nice strong engines which is nice when you need to tow something or when you're going up steep hills. I have found them to be very safe as well. Easy to handle in snow, ice, rain....

The only thing I don't like about my Astros is the cramped legroom in the front passenger seat. You are forced to keep your left leg bent which can be VERY uncomfortable on long trips. But my solution has been that I always drive and let my hubby sit over there....LOL

All in all I love my Astros and would most likely purchase another one in the future. I would DEFINATELY buy another one if they fix the leg room problem.<br><br>
