            I really wasn't looking for a Nissan car when I bought mine...I have always bought American made cars..but I decided to stop at a Nissan dealership...and am I glad I did..the car handles well in all kinds of weather...the maintenance on the car is low ...the gas mileage is very good and it is a great looking car....I have had absolutely no problems with it...the dealership employees were very helpful and friendly...willing to deal with me...the warranty is wonderful and the price was very good...I would recommend that anyone looking for a compact sporty low maintenance car buy a Nissan Maxima...<br><br>
