            When I was an Isuzu sales representative, I was not the only one to be excited to hear about the release of a new vehicle to Isuzu's line.  And as soon as the VehiCross rolled off our delivery trucks I knew I wasn't too sweet on it. 

The body styling is one of the first things that made me twist my mouth downward.  I once had a customer tell me &quot;the thing is so ugly it's kinda cute&quot;.  I had to agree.  In the silver it is lovely, in the other colors... I'd pass.  But climb in...it's a little different.  I enjoyed the leather seating and the adjustable seats but the red trim (standard on all exterior colors) had to go.  I don't know about you but I have found (over the years) that red interiors fade to a rather nasty orange color.  Not my preference.  

If you are trying to climb in the back seats, it is incredibly difficult.  I'm 5' 8&quot; and I had a hard time climbing in the back.  I used to grimace every time one of my taller customers would bang their heads.  It happened often.  Once in the back seats though, you have all sorts of room!  I fit three six foot tall men in the back of one VehiCross and they loved the room!  They could comfortably stretch their legs and didn't feel as if they were 'sitting' on each other.  They just wished it was easier to get in and out of, or was a four door.  

As for driving the VehiCross though... I did love the handling!  It was tough, gutsy and rugged but with a very smooth ride.  Just don't try to back up.  You can't see anything out of that oddly shaped rear window.  I was one that was trained to use the windows and the mirrors when backing up.  With the VehiCross it's the mirrors only.  You can not see clearly out the rear of this vehicle no matter how tall you are.  I do believe that at least three of our sales reps ran into poles or other vehicles when backing up the VehiCross.  All said they couldn't see anything!  

Since it is an Isuzu you can rely on the dependability of the VehiCross.  It has the same research and testing put into it as the reliable Trooper and Rodeo.  

I believe that the only other area where the VehiCross is lacking is the price.  For the same price you can get an Isuzu Trooper.  You'll have the same horse power, torque, and towing capacity.  You will have a more comfortable ride for your passengers and a little more cargo room.  

When it comes right down to it, the Isuzu VehiCross is a little over priced, and definelty over hyped.  But if you like things that are nifty and new and you have to have something a little different... then you'll probably like the VehiCross.<br><br>
