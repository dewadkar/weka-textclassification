            The Chevy Tahoe is a great car and a great value. It's greatest feature is its incredibly roomy interior, which feels very luxurious compared to more expensive models like the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, or the Range Rover.

Other highpoints include visibility, and highway road handling. When you're taking a long trip, the Tahoe will give you a nice sense of security, not only because of its large size, but because its height allows you to see what's happening down the road. The Tahoe also doesn't need to be &quot;driven&quot;. It sticks to the road nicely and points like a hunting dog.

The AC Delco sound system is also really impressive.

The worst thing about the Tahoe is its braking system. Atrocious. This is a rather important feature in a truck this big, and it means that the driver has to be cautious about road speed.

Still, I love the Tahoe, and recommend it to anyone who will listen. <br><br>
