            I hate to be the one to break ranks with the Saturn &quot;send me to a bbq in Spring Hill, TN&quot; set, but this car just plain stinks.  I am basing my opinion on being stranded a few too many times and a ride that is more suited for a lumber wagon.  First of all I treated this car with the same care that I have every other: religious about the oil changes every 2.5 to 3k miles, all recommended services at the proper intervals, etc.  Since I have had this car (12/95) I have had a series of large and small problems that have left me furious/wet/hearing-diminished/carless and a favored customer at the rental agency.  There have been minor problems like the odometer making an annoying clicking sound (replacement needed/overnight job).  Another fit/finish problem has been the weather stripping which has shrunk and pulled away from the doors (Saturn solution: get a tube of glue, it's no biggie.&quot;)  The engine/drivetrain noise is just way out of hand.  I have to turn the stereo up fairly high and conversations on the highway are quite strained.  The plastic on the dashboard is now warping above the instrument panel.  And for the best of all,  I shelled out $1,800 bucks because of a cracked cylinder head.  In their defense Saturn did implement a recall -- oops-- they said it was a policy not a recall but not before I went through hell with trying to understand how a car with 60k miles and by their own admission all proper work done could develop such a major defect.  I just recently was stranded because of an alternator that worked sometimes and depleted the battery at others.  This was after I told them the panel lights kept dimming and they said the electrical system check out fine.  I know -- good material for an X-files episode.  The front airdam has fallen off from the same side three times.  The rear defogger began to give up the ghost the day after the warranty was up.  I could continue but the point is Saturn has been more hype to me than anything in the way of substance.  Hello Honda.<br><br>
