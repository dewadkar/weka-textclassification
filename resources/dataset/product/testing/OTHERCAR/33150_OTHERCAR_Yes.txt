            My opinions are based on a 1.5 week business rental from Avis. I drove a silver Mailbu (base trim level) with the typical rental car feature set -- power windows, door locks, CD player, and cloth seats. The car had about 20,000 miles when I picked it up, and I added 500 miles to that over the rental period.

<b>ENGINE:</b> surprisingly smooth, with enough power to enter freeways with confidence. Power was plentiful with just two aboard, but showed some strain with a full load of passengers and luggage.

<b>INTERIOR:</b> The Malibu is a definite improvement over Chevy/GM's previous attempts at building a competitive family sedan. The cloth seats were comfortable, though the power adjustments found in the LS trim level would have been welcome. Because I am on the shorter side, a height adjustment -- even a manual one -- would have helped. Small touches, such as the dash-mounted ignition, driver-side cupholder, and the elbow-level armrest and gear-shift were nice surprises.

<b>MISC:</b> even with 20,000+ miles, our rental was remarkably solid, with no rattles or excessive signs of wear-and-tear.

The Malibu was a fine rental vehicle, and I would gladly rent another one on my next business trip. In fact, the reason I rented from the agency I got the Malibu from was because of a less-than-spectacular experience with a Ford Contour rental. However, the Mailbu's fleet success has given it somewhat of a "rental car" identity. That alone would make me think twice before purchasing one for personal use.
