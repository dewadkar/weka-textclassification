            I had never heard of an Mazda MX-3 before and I just happend to stumble across one when I was shopping for a new sports car. I was interested in the looks of the car first. The outside shape is amazing, the rear hatch is slanted at an angle that I thought only came on exotic sports cars, the aerodynamic profile is impressive, and just the overall futuristic look of the car pulled me in. 

After I got in, I fell in love with the car even more. All of the instruments on the dash are easy to operate and see. And for being such a small car, there is plenty of room for bigger people to sit in comfort in the front of the car, the back is a little cramped. The backseat folds down to expand the cargo space of the trunk as well as the hatch cover being removeable which also gives you added space in the back of the car.

 You get good visability and response for the car, the only con I find in handling is that the brakes could be better. There is minimal interior noise, although the hatch does rattle a little bit it is not noticble when you are listening to the radio. The seats could be a little plusher, but none the less the bucket seats hold you in with comfort. 

The MX-3 is also a fast little car for the engines that are offered. There is the 4 cylendar DOHC engine (which is what I have) that offers a base horsepower of 105 and the V6 model with 115 horse power. The clutch in the manual version (what I have) responds very well to the driver and I have never had any problems with it. One of the biggest problems I have with the car is finding parts for it. The MX-3 was discontinued in 1995 so it is a little hard to find some parts but most car clubs or auto dealers will be more than happy to help you out. I have never come across anything that I couldnt find except for &quot;performance&quot; parts such as engine upgrades and such. But where there is money there is a way. 

I would recommend this car to anyone. It is a great car as a first car because the car is so small and easy to handle as well as having significant horse power. But any auto enthustiast would appriciate this car. Oh and the car gets 29 miles per gallon in the city and 32 miles per gallon on the highway.<br><br>
