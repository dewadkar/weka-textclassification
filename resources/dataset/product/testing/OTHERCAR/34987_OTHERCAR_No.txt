            I bought my '99 Century last summer because I needed a practical auto for a change.  It's turned out to be the worst new car I've ever bought.  Although it's reliable and had adequate interior room (I'm 6'4&quot;), the &quot;ABS&quot; brakes don't act like ABS; they lock up.  There's a rattle in the left front area that the dealer can't locate.  The air scoop was so low it scraped on almost everything, even concrete parking barriers.  I had the dealer remove it--they knew what the problem was as soon as I asked how functional the thing is and offered no reason to leave it on--it must be a common problem.

Features include mirrors that dim automatically and automatic headlights; they work fine and are appreciated.  Other lighting features (that can't be disabled) seem to be a security threat (the interior lights all come on when you remove the key from the ignition and stay on after you enter the car).

It's fine on highways and smooth roads, if you ignore the flimsy cup holder.  Not to mention the a/c vents that are difficult to adjust adequately.
