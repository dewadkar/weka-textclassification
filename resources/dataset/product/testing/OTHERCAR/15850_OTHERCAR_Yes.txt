            We decided to trade in our 98 Ford Expedition for the 98 Suburban.  We have never regretted that decision!  It has daylight running lights for added safety not to mention it is equipped with the comfort package (side view mirrors that defrost, remote for the security and lighting in your house and best of all... yes... for those cold mornings... driver and front passenger seat warmers.  The kids really love it, my 5 year old heads to the third seat each morning on the way to school (his retreat).  We have made several vacations in this vehicle and there is just no comparison to any other vehicle of this size.  Most consider this vehicle exclusively for families but it is great for the single person also (you can pack 8 or 9 people safely in it) and head to the beach or a crazy night on the town. My fiance has always owned Ford vehicles but I think the Suburban has changed him for life!!!!  <br><br>
