            Chevy's got it!  It took me 2 months to determine what truck I wanted (Chevy vs. Ford).  I've owned both, and both have been good to me.  It was, in fact, a nice looking step-side extended cab Lariat driving down the road that caught my eye and gave me the "I want a new truck" bug.

I first started looking at Fords, which I liked a lot.  Then I saw the sport-side (step-side) Chevy, which I liked just a little bit more.  The biggest reason I chose the Chevy was for it's large extended cab and exterior looks.

I've had the truck for a month, and I love it.  The extended cab step-sides are not very common; I got the only one available in 6 states.  The bucket seats are very comfortable, as is the rear bench.  My wife is 5"-3" and she has no problem driving the truck.

Things I love the most:  

1) Exterior looks:  Strong profile.  Even though all the critics say that the design changes are not bold enough to keep up with Ford and Dodge, I disagree... I think it's the "cleanest" design on the road.

2) Interior looks:  Dark charcoal cloth seats and dash are visually impressive.  Initially, I wasn't certain if I would like the instrument and controls layout (I like Ford's better).  But the Chevy has been very user friendly and it is growing on me.  None of the critics like the cluster of controls on the turn signal stalk.  I didn't think I'd like it either, but I have had no problems with it.

3) Engine performance and power:  Although similar the 5.4L Ford, it seems to be a tad stronger.  Very smooth shifting (for a 4x4 truck).

4) Driving and handling:  Very smooth and confident on the road and in the turns.  I have not yet taken it off road.  I very often look down at the speedometer and realize that I am going 70 mph.  It is smooth and quiet.

5)  Extended cab:  This is one of the main reasons I chose the Chevy.  Although this will not be the primary family vehicle, it will be (and already has been) used for long trips with our 7 year old daughter and her friends.  Access to the rear bench is excellent now that the fourth door has been added.  I would have gone with the Ford if there wasn't a fourth door on the 2001 Chevy.

Things I like the least (do not let any of these stop you from buying this truck.  Most are minor and nit-picky):

1) Wind noise at door seal:  I probably would not have noticed this had I not read it in someone else's epinion.  The wind noise is not any more than most other vehicles I have been in with the radio turned down.  But I think Chevy could have made a tighter seal.

2) ABS system:  4 wheel disks are excellent, and according to reports, will stop the truck from 60-0 10 feet better than other big trucks.  But it feels like there is too much pulsation in the pedal when firm (not extreme) brakes are applied (this is a minor complaint).  

3) Cost:  All of the big trucks are within $1500, so I can't complain too much.  Chevy was the most expensive.

4) Tires:  I wish they would offer a 17" option.  Out of all the tires Chevy could have chosen, why did they use the Firestone Wilderness AT tires?

5) Stereo: Although not bad, it could be better quality considering the money I paid.  Chevy needs to find a place to include a factory 6" or 8" sub.  I plan to eventually change the speakers, install an amp and a sub.

6) I would rather have an option for a power moon roof instead of the compartment cluster on the ceiling.

Recommendations:

1)  Spray-in bedliner (Line-X):  Get one!  It looks a lot better, has a lifetime warranty, and is very functional.

2)  Front grill screen covers (Lund):  Easy to install and remove.  304 stainless surrounding the bow tie makes for an attractive and unique look from the front.  I recommend replacing the black plastic thumb screws with stainless screws.  Somebody told me to that I need to watch the temp guage on hot summer days; air flow through the front will be restricted some.  I have not yet experienced any problems at 80 degrees.  

3) Put double-sided tape underneath the black plastic covers on top of the bed walls (if equipped).  I noticed that they flap in the wind when driving on the highway.  Chevy could have done better mounting them more solidly.

4) To make your decision, read these reviews on all the trucks (Ford, Dodge, Chevy, Toyota).  Do not take everything that everybody says to be true.  I found that most people who bought a Ford, love it... most people who bought a Chevy, love it.  Make sure you get what you want and pay a little extra if you need to.
