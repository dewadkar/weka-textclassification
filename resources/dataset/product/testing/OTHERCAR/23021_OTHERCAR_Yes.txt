            I bought this digital camera to take pictures of my son and to take pictures of the items I sell on Ebay.It is a great camera for the price.I really didn't expect too much for only $179.99. After using the camera I was very surprised at how easy it was to operate and the quality of the pictures.

I used owned a Kodak DC200 but wasn't all to impressed with the download time it took to get the pictures on the PC or the quality of pictures. I use my PDC 640 all the time, and the only fault I think it has is that the batteries drain fast.You deal with that with every digital camera with a LDC though.

I love the way the camera turns on when you slide the front cover off the front lens.I also love the LCD view screen. The PDC640 only comes with a 2 MB card as most other cameras do,manuals, it also comes with a camera case,AC adapter,a cord to view your pictures on your television,great software and a computer download adapter....I bought a Simple Technology smartcard reader to reduce download time from the camera to the PC. If you are going to buy ANY digital camera buy a card reader! The only cost 30.00 at www.Buy.com. 

Over all this camera is excellent and the software is easy and fast to use. If you are looking for a casual digital camera to get and cant afford to go out and spend $500.00 on a high tech digital camera I highly recommend this one.Its great for personal use but wouldn't be good for taking professional pictures or something like that.

If you would like to see pictures taken with this camera email me I will send you one. Marlow@peoplepc.com .<br><br>
