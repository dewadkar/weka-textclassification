<TEXT>
            I bought my 1998 Navigator used with 15,000 miles on it. We love the looks and drive except we spend most of our time at the dealer with repairs.  So far we have been trying to identify many strange noises, replaced the 5.4 motor at 34k, aligned several times, rotated tires several times, replaced shocks, fixed the moon roof and the list goes on and on.
I want to love my Navigator but I am starting to lose my patience.  My dealer is great and attends to my every need. (every time)
But should I have gone for the Eddie Bauer and saved 15k??????<br><br>
