            This review is for a 1985 Toyota Celica GT. It has a 22r-e 2.4L 4 cylinder compared to a 5m-ge 2.8L 6 cylinder in the Celica supra, and a solid rear axle, instead of IRS in the Celica supra. Otherwise, the cars are similar. 

My celica is a GT model.  At the time of this review, it has about 100400 miles. I have never done any major maintenance or repairs on it. The car shows its age, but overall is very solid. 

Quick Specs: 
Engine: 2.4L 8valve 22r-e, single port EFI 
Horsepower: 116@4800rpms 
Torque: 140lbs@2800rpms 
Bore and Stroke(in.): 3.62x3.50 
Suspension-front: McPherson Strut 
Suspension-rear: solid axle w/panhard bar 
Steering: rack and pinion 
Coefficient of Drag: .340 

The 22r-e engine is a workhorse. These engines were also used in Toyota pickups and 4runners, and many have over 300000 miles. It is insane the amount of abuse these engines can take and they just keep running. The strength is in low to mid range power. However, above 4500rpms, the engine seems to run out of steam. 

The car, stock, is not a rocket, but at 2500lbs, it will own any 80's Honda civic, accord or prelude, and most comparable cars from the era as well. It can keep up with many newer model cars too. There are many aftermarket parts available for the 22r series engines. They can be built up to 300+hp, turbocharged. Parts are kind of pricey compared to ford or GM 4 cylinder parts though. It could be made into a real sleeper. 

My Celica has the Toyota A40D 4 speed automatic transmission. It is fair enough. It doesn't keep shifting between 3rd and 4th anytime the accelerator is tapped, like in some cars I have been in. 

I have gotten pretty poor gas mileage(low 20's mpg), however this is mostly local driving. On the highway, I get closer to 30mpg. 

The handling of the car is not great; however, my car is on its original shocks and struts that are 18 years old! Adding a front tower bar and bigger rear track bar could improve the handling, as the car does exhibit some body roll. The ride is pretty rough, but more then bearable for me. Note that the Celica gt-s and Celica supra had a completely different rear end, with IRS. One thing I like about the car is one of the few rear wheel drive compact cars from the 80's-present. With 185mm width tires, it is easy to throw the rear end around and brake it loose in acceleration, but it is easy to control and the car is responsive to input from the wheel and throttle. Overall I feel that it is easy to control and find the limits of the car, and it is fun to drive. You could defiantly do some mad drifting in this car. 

The interior of the Celica is well laid out. The instrument panel has a 130mph speedometer(82-83 Celicas and Celica Supras has a 85mph speedo) tachometer, as well as a voltometer and oil pressure gauge. The seats are comfortable, way better then the seats in my moms 1999 Maxima. The Celica Supra and Celica Gt-s had even better seats. Space in the rear seats are limited as expected. Hatchback models have good room for storage though. Overall the car feels very good, everything seems in place, the build quality is good. 

The wedge shaped exterior styling with pop-up headlights is classic 80&#146s. The styling is pretty distinctive nowadays. Rather impressive is that the car is pretty aerodynamic, with a drag coefficient of .340. Looking at the car, you wouldn&#146t think a boxy 80&#146s car would be as aerodynamic as many 90&#146s jellybean cars. 

The biggest problem with these cars is the rust. I don't know why but these cars rust like crazy. In addition to rust on the rear hatch, there could be rust to the wheel wells, and other areas.
