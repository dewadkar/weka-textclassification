            In a world where most cars are starting to look and act the same, there is only one that does something just a little different.  The end result is massive.  Either i am too old for my own good, or I am just too horsepower hungry.  What lured me to the GTP was the fact that it is the only coup/sedan on the market that still utilizes the supercharger.  For all you younger drivers out there, that is an old piece of technology left over from the days of true muscle cars.  Coupled with modern technology, you have a mid sized V6 engine with forced-induction.  What does this mean?  Horsepower.  I believe the range is 240-260 BHP within 4-5k RPM.  Sorry Ford, but your Mustangs with the 289 V8 can't even keep up.  The next thing is comfort.  I tested a lot of cars recently, and the only one was just as comfortable in the back as well as the front was the GTP.  Just to clarify, it was the coup that I tested.  The wider wheel base is nice, too.  Too bad they don't have a suspension tough enough to match.  It handles well, really well, but MacPhearson (sp?) shocks and struts would not be my first pick for suspension.  With the gas prices today, people ask me, &quot;How much does that supercharger suck up?&quot;.  Superchargers are like turbos, they only work when they need to.  Turbos work too late and too hard, while supercharger roll up their sleeves when you feed them.  As for the gas mileage, the Pontiac Grand Prix GTP is just as good as any other sedan or coup on the market as long as you lay off the throttle.  The other minor things I don't like about this car are the seat belts and the color availability.  Color is the only thing keeping me from buying one today.  I guess I will just have to go with black.  If you're like me, look into one.  They are well built, strong, fast and they handle very good in most road situations.  They need work in minor areas such as cosmetics.  Even if your one of those, &quot;I hate American cars!&quot; I challenge you to test drive this monster and tell me what you think after.  Happy speeding!<br><br>
