            Along with brands such as Mitsubishi, Subaru has never been considered a great manufacturer although it has been winning Rally Races all over the world in the World Rally Championship. In Europe and Asia, they have been selling cars in high volumes despite the questionable style. 

ALL Subaru are All-Wheel-Drive vehicles and handle great on and off road(mud, snow, ice, sand...). They are also a lot more reliable now that people would believe. Their style has evolved and become more modern although this car is really apart from other vehicles in its class. You either love it or hate it. 

If you do not like the style, I would still suggest that you take it for a spin and you would soon forget about the exterior. This car is simply a joy to drive, it is exciting like a brand new toy is to a kid. Personally, I got used to the styling and really like the yellow and blue ones. The flared sides on the sedan really add to the sporty and aggressive look of the car; give it that RALLY look that the car certainly deserves. 

However, I have to admit that I have been attracted to the Wagon a little more. My favorite is the Yellow WRX Wagon. It is amazing how roomy that little car is and the wagon style gives it even more room and flexibility. The wagon's shape also looks more balanced. While the yellow is modern and sporty, the gray is classier. The wagon has All-Wheel-Drive, flexible cargo capacity, a rear lift gate instead of a tailgate, and spirited on-road ability. 

This wagon is wicked-fast and will surprise many expensive sport-car drivers at red lights or even on small curvy roads. Watch the yellow wagon on your right! At $24k, this car has a 2.0 liter H4 engine developing 227 horsepower and putting out 217 lb.-ft of torque for a weight of 3165 lbs. The engine is matched to a very precise 5-speed manual box and has the help of a great All-Wheel-Drive system to put the power down to the ground(one of the oldest and best on the market with Audiï¿½s Quattro system). 

Where else on the market can you get all that for under 25k? You get the famous All-Wheel-Drive, the performance of an Audi S4 or , Honda S2000, or Porsche Boxter, the handling of a Rally car, and room for 4/5 plus a bike, or baggage. To me it is a nice package with no competition on the market. I have to add that the seats are very comfortable, among the best in the class, and the front bucket seats also offer great support in the sportiest driving conditions. The Momo Steering wheel helps complete the package. 

The STI planned to come on the US market in 2003 will be even better with about 40 more horse power, better suspension and handling, bigger wheels, and more styling options. I have had the privilege to drive the European version and it is simply unbelievable. You can toss the car right and left in safety and beat any sport car on small roads. It will just smoke more powerful American cars like the Mustang Cobra. When the car crosses the pond, it will be in my garage with no doubt! 

On the negative side, I will note a few very forgivable points. 1- The car's style might hurt the sales as a lot of people will not even test-drive car they do not like at first. First Impressions are a B---h! 
2- Although the engine is amazing, American drivers will complain about the turbo Lag. Before 3500 RPM, the car is just a regular 2.0liter 4 cylinder, and perform as such. After that, the car has EXPLOSIVE power and acceleration will be push and stick you to the seat. It is not A V8. 
3- Brakes perform very well but will fade faster than A S4's or M3's. 
4- Refinement is not that of a BMW or S4. 

But again, why would we expect all this from a 24000 dollar car! For the price, I am willing to forget those 4 cons and am ready take the wheel! A S4 will cost 16k more and a M3 twice the price! As for the turbo lag, you will get used to it and probably even enjoy changing gears more often to use the full power of this great engine. 

I will recommend buying this modern car because it has so much to offer for a low price: Performance, handling and safety, different style in an era where 80% of the cars in the street all look alike, Cargo flexibility... This car is a good car for single adults or a young small family with 2 kids. 

THINK ABOUT THIS AGAIN: A S4's performance and All-Wheel-Drive, with a Station Wagon's roominess and flexibility, a unique styling for 24k. Comfort and luxury may not be that of a German car but who cares! I am young; I'll buy the Subaru, use the extra 15-20k to pay off credit cards, or buy A Harley..... 

Go drive it and share the excitement!
