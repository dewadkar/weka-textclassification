            I've sold cars for 4 different dealerships representing 17 different car companies... and my wife and I bought a Chevy Blazer (new in 1998).  We switched from a Nissan Pathfinder, and the switch was well worth it.  We felt cramped in the Pathfinder, and its ride was uncomfortable.

The Blazer was my top choice after driving everything from a Tracker to an Expedition.  That means a lot coming from someone who grew up on Fords.  

The Blazer is a perfect family vehicle, providing room for kids and equipment without sacrificing style.  We have had no maintenance problems in 64K miles.  We've taken the vehicle on two 14-hour drives, and have no complaints about comfort.

The size is right, the style is right, and the price is right.

Buy this vehicle if you are looking for a reasonably priced family vehicle that still looks good!<br><br>
