            We bought our matrix about a year ago and my husband and I have been very happy with the purchase.  I like the sporty look of it, both inside and out.  Even the air vents are a cool round shape.  

But most of all, I like the versatility of it.  The rear seats fold down to provide more space than you would think just by looking at the car.  We once bought a car top carrier and fit the whole thing in it's box in the matrix with no problem.  

In the back and on the backs of the rear seats, there are tracks with connectors that slide back and forth on a hard surface which is easy to clean.  These can be used to tie something down using the straps or the cargo nets that came with the car.  We have used all these tools quite a few times.  

The front passenger side seat has a rubber no skid surface on the back so that you can fold it down, sit behind it, and put your laptop, dvd player, etc on it.  Plus not only are there 2 different lighter type outlets, but there is also a regular type outlet like at home on the dash.  On car trips, one of us sits in back and watches movies on the laptop while the other drives.  

I like that there are a lot of storage compartments in the front.  It's easy to keep my car clutter free now.

Lastly, I'd like to mention it is fun to drive.  It has get up and go and I got the 4wheel drive version which is very helpful in the snow.  I drive a 20 mile commute every day over steep hills, and have had no problems.
