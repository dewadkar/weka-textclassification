            After my transfer from Germany to the States I was looking forward to the experience of �relaxed� driving on American highways and to my company car: a 1995 Bonneville SSE. Since we have lived in France for more than four years where everyone drives a small car and the roads are nothing else than racing tracks this new experience kept all promises of my wildest dreams.

If you like a smooth and relaxing ride, if you are looking for a luxury of features, combined with ease of use and comfort at long distances, the Bonneville should be something to look at. I enjoy every minute of driving and realize that I do not get from A to B faster but a lot more relaxed! To prove that all slogans for large, roomy cars are true, there is absolutely no way to reach the co.�s door pocket while being buckled in the driver�s seat. You have to move out of your seat to reach there!

The SSE is extremely comfortable. The seats are big, I mean really BIG, and offer a stay-in-pace-fit automatic for adjusting in 8 directions. The rear bench features a pass-though in the arm rest (along with two cup holders) for ski or any other items that may be longer as the HUGE(!!!) trunk with it�s capacity of 18 cubic feet. Additional cup holders are available in the doors and middle console. Belts are adjustable even for children�s size. The design is especially made to keep the belt away from children�s neck and face. 

The instrument panel is clear, very easy to read (without moving out of the perfect driving position!) and the backlight not too bright (some middle shade between orange and red, pretty warm and you can dim it too). There is a control center in the middle of the panes that tells you the oil and coolant levels or whether the hood or trunk is not completely closed. The overhead lamps are very useful, don�t dazzle and can be used per seat (all four seats). They give a nice light to read a map and have a pretty narrow lightening point. That�s why they do not bother at all while driving.

Cruise control is very nicely done. You can not activate or deactivate by accident and stay in control all the time. Easy to reach and control. The pre-installed car audio system is wonderful and gives a clear tone over the 8-speaker system. Bass is not too bouncy and fading/balance really work fine. Here too: everything in your reach. All doors are very heavy, open very wide and there are handles all over the place, so it should be no problem for big or older person too.

The 95 SSE comes with a powerful V6, 3.8liter engine that puts a solid 205 horsepower (2nd edition, produced from 2nd half year of 95 on) onto the road. Also the car features dual airbags, anti-lock brakes, rear door child security and central lock. 

Initially the car feels very heavy but you would be surprised when slipping behind the steering wheel how easy and smooth it behaves. Very quiet but powerful, lies heavily in curves and on snow. The 4-speed automatic transmission proofs as more efficient to me, rather than a 5-speed.

Some Specs:
Length 200.5 inches / Height 55.7 inches / Width 74.7 inches
Fuel tank 18 gallons / 19 miles per gallon city � 28 highway

The only downturn though: while driving on wet roads or in slight rain and leaving the windows a little open, it always drops inside. On the other hand wind circulation is just right and not too stormy when driving with open driver�s side window.

I always enjoy riding this car very much, when I go for lunch with customers it does not matter at all if they are big or small even if they are 4 of them joining me in the car.<br><br>
