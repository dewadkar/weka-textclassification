            After having a red 1992 mercury tracer for about 3 years now I can fully say that for what was paid brand new back in 92, this car is well worth it's money. The car has been in the family since bought new, and it has been in my possession for the last 3 years. In that time period I have put about 40,000 miles on it, for a total of 108,000. The only major repairs have been a radiator that leaked and a new transmission( this part was not due to failure of the car, more due to carelessness of driver). Car still runs well after 11 years, everything works well, including power sunroof and power windows. Engine, despite some hard driving, still pulls well and while i have not have it dynoed, i believe that it still holds perhaps 90% of it's original power. I have not noticed any loss of performance in the three years I have driven it regularly. The steering feels tight and the car seems easily able to move out of situations easily. While it may not have a lot of power, this car is definitely fun to drive. It's low-to-the-ground stance and small size and weight make it easily controllable. Brake pedal response is very good and even without ABS, the car stops relatively well, seemingly much faster than heavier cars I have driven. While underpowered by today's standards, the car does not feel slow. A particular favorite of mine are the automatic seat belts. There have been a few problems however, mostly things you would associate with economy cars of this class. The interior feels very plasticky and pieces have a tendency to work themselves loose. The stock radio, before I changed it, had very good reception, sounded pretty good, but the buttons were sort of small, and hard to adjust. As for comfort in the car, road noise is an issue on rough roads sometimes. Space is also an issue if you are are tall or overweight... I am 6'3" and I have to seriously slouch to fit in this car. Any taller would definitely create problems, although it would in any compact car. The seats are still comfortable for long trips, I just took one recently for 8 hours and did not get sore at all, despite the lack of headroom. The back seat is best designed for children or short adults, as 6 footers would have a serious problem with leg room, with the front seat all the way back. As far as trunk room, of all the compact cars I have seen this one some of the best trunk space around. A weeks worth of supplies for 2 people would easily fit in the trunk of this car. The car gets very good gas mileage, around 29 mpg around town. I would recommend this car most definitely as a student's car or a first car for a new driver.
