            I own a Fuji FinePix 4900z that I purchased in December 2000.  After the excellent quality I got out of that camera, it didn't take much to convince me that I would buy a Fuji FinePix for my mother's Christmas gift in 2001.  That's where the 2600z came in.

I researched cameras a lot before buying my 4900z.  My experiences taught me some of the things to look for in other cameras and nothing compared to the Fuji.  This line of cameras definitely gives you the most bang for the buck!  

The 2600z has a 3x optical zoom which is just perfect enough for the average snapshots.  The digital zoom you find in other cameras is not what you want to look at.  My experience tells me to leave the digital zoom turned off and if you want a picture cropped, do it AFTER you save the picture to your computer.  You'll be happier.

The size of this camera is great.  It's big enough to handle but small enough to keep in a pocket or a purse.  Get a simple carrying case and you won't have any problems keeping this camera with you wherever you go.  Not only is it small but the menu navigation and other button controls are easy to control.

What I have noticed about Fuji cameras is that the pictures usually turn out great.  Practice with digital cameras is essential in order to take shots that you normally would take with a 35mm.  Spontaneous shots and fast action shots are the hardest since a slight delay happens when you push the shutter button.  The best way to get around this is to prepare the camera by holding the button halfway down while anticipating the shot.  Nonetheless, the exposures are terrific!  The hardest part of getting a proper exposure is when using the flash.  The flash has a short range but can be adjusted to help you get the proper exposure you're looking for.  My 4900z has a hot shoe for an external flash connection and I have had the need for that on one or two occasions.

It is a fragile camera - somewhat.  This camera was dropped with the lens extended.  The lens broke loose but did not break off.  Overall, the camera is still usable and takes great pictures but it is going to get repaired because a loose lens causes the pictures to sometimes be out of focus.  It is very encouraging to know that it dropped and all the electrical components work properly.

The only other flaw that I've found is that the lens cover is very easy to not have open all the way.  This keeps the camera from turning on, or if it is pushed slightly closed, it will turn the camera off unwillingly.
