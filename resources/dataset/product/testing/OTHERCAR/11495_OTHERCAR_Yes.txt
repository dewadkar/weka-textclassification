            This is the second used Park Avenue I have owned.  The first was a
1990 and I traded it in two years ago after it hit 140,000 miles.  It
had 50,000 when I purchased it.  It never gave me any trouble except
for brakes.  Everything else ran perfectly.  My second Park Avenue is
1996 and I am now up to 78,000 miles.  Aside from oil changes and 
new front tires, I have not put any money into it.  I had genseal
tires on all four rims but had a flat tire on the front.  So I switched
the front tires to regular radial.  I was not going to put that kind
of money into a genseal tire that didn't do what it was suppose to do.
I enjoy riding in my Park Ave, it is smooth and roomy car.  It is 
extremely comfortable when I have to drive from Florida to New York State
and back again.  You can be sure that my next car will be a Park
Avenue.<br><br>
