            My husband and I treated ourselves for Christmas.We got a Polaroid PhotoMax PDC-640 Digital Camera.This camera take's excellent picture's and focuses very well.It also has an automatic flash you can set for the flash to go off when you take the picture or you can set the flash yourself and then take the picture.You can set the camera on how many picture's you want to take with this camera.The other thing we love about this camera is we never have to buy film again.It has a disk in it so you can keep or delete the picture's you want on it.

Also you can download the picture's into your computer.When we got this camera it came with all the attachment's you need to download the picture's into your computer.Plus a cd where you can put your picture on a postcard or in a photo album it supplies for you.These are just some of the reason's why we like the Polaroid PhotoMax PDC-640 Digital Camera.If you are in the market for a digital camera that take's excellent picture's who should go to you local retail store and look at the Polaroid PhotoMax PDC-640 Digital Camera.<br><br>
