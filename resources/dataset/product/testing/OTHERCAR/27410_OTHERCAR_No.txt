            I bought a 95 Neon, and had no real problem in the first 4 1/2 years.  I treated the thing like a baby, not pretending it was a Camaro by any stretch of the imagination.  However, in this past year, many things have gone wrong.  For starters, the head gasket blew.  After it was &quot;repaired&quot;, I noticed months later that oil was getting into the radiator tank.  One garage told me the gasket blew again (despite no apparent loss of engine performance).  I took it to the Chrysler dealer, and after hundreds of dollars of tests, I was told it was just built up oil in the rad hoses seeping into the rad tank.  However, a month later I noticed I was a quart low on oil.  Also, there have been several electronic problems; dash lights flickering, cruise control malfunctioning, cigarette lighter fuse blowing, etc. to name a few.  All of the aforementioned problems happened just AFTER I paid the car off.  Isn't that how it goes?  Other than that, aside from fairly loud highway noise, and some rattles, the car handles well (forgot to mention, suspension is shot now too).  Not exactly a bargain car; may be good for a short term lease.  UPDATE:  Oil still getting into Rad overflow tank, so I went back to Chrysler.. found out that if your gasket goes before 100k miles or before 5 years, they cover the cost.  BUT, if you break down in the middle of nowhere, and can't be towed to a Chrysler dealer, Chrysler WILL NOT pay for anything but the parts (Whoopeee $45 in my case).  I think that's highly dishonest and unfair.  I'm never buying Chrysler again.  Their gasket failed.  Plain and simple.  By doing this they are saying I shouldn't drive my car where there isn't a dealer nearby.<br><br>
