            The Mazda Protege:  I bought a '97 in '97 for several reasons.  The company was having a national sale on the LX models for a DX price.  When in buying any automobile, look for the national ads.  In the test drive, the car handled really well.  Reading Consumer Reports helped in my decision to buy the Protege also.  Overall the car held up in the mechanics department.  It had just enough of the sporty look to have people give it a second glance, but not too flashy.  I felt the steering was bit too touchy, but I have gotten used to that over the last 2.5 years.  The one thing I don't like about the Protege is when I need to make a 'run for it' the car it self doesn't have much get up and go, unless you tack it over 3 RPM's.  That may also be because I have a manual and not an automatic.  I've also had a lot of electrical problems.  The worst one has been with the speakers.  These are stock speakers and the dealership has replaced all of them, but I'm still having the same problem.  They cut in and out at times for no reason.  And for some reason I've gone through 3 dome lights, but that could just be the manufacturer of the bulbs.  This car does have excellent gas mileage though.  I average 25 city to 32 highway.  The seating is very comfortable, especially the front seats.  I believe this car is really designed more for the smaller person, not the tall or big.  Overall driving of the Protege is roomy and comfy.  Taking long trips isn't a problem in this car.  I do not like where they have put the E Brake though.  It's right in between of the seats.  Behind that is small , hardly useful storage bin.  They should have made that all a storage bin or left is alone and put the E brake behind the wheel.  Average price for this model, LX, all power, CD player, is around $16,000.  Who should buy this car?  Small, not too tall of a person that needs a good family/commuter car.  Who shouldn't?  Tall or big people that want/need a car for show and tell.  I really like the Protege and will probably end up buying another one in the next 5-8 years.  Reliability on the Protege is very high.<br><br>
