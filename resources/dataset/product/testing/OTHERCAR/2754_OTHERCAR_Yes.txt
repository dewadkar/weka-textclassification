                Ah this car is my absolute pride and joy, since this is my first car (I am 18), this has probably affected my opinion of it. However, I am not easily impressed, so this car has done a lot in my mind to impress me.

    I had decided to buy my car in manual because I feel it is the only real way to drive this car. If you decide to buy this car in automatic you must beware that you are giving up a lot in power and acceleration, as well as efficiency in terms of gas mileage. For those who might be learning how to drive stick on this car it is very easy because the clutch on all VW�s is very forgiving. So this was a definite benefit in the car. One thing that all first time vw owners must get used to is the unique position that reverse is in.

    Like all other VWs that I have driven, this car has a very responsive steering wheel along with a great turning radius.
This helps in our world of parking lots and other tight spaces. This gives the car an advantage that many SUVs don�t have. One thing to be aware of though is that the base tires that come with the car do not handle vary well in anything but ideal weather conditions, so it is a wise investment after you buy this car to get a pair of better tires.
This may not be a problem based on the area that you live in; nor for me because I go snowboarding a lot, my constant trips up to Vermont would kill me if I didn�t have better tires. 

The car itself is very roomy so it can hold tons of bags in the trunk as well as up to 5 people in the main cabin of the car. However it is possible to get up to and including 6 in it. If you do get many people in your car than it might be worth your time to go and look into getting the 8 speaker Bose sound system. For a factory-installed system it is not bad. The system can handle a wide range of sounds from very low base tones to the higher pitched cymbals and vocals of the music you are listening to. Also if you are careful you can get your car with a roofrack on it, many dealerships now do little things like this to entice you towards buying the car, hey it worked for me.

The engine itself is very powerful boasting about 180 bhp, the engine is also very expandable with the possibility of attaching more efficient intakes and even turbo boosts, single or twin. Nuespeed mskes a complete line of everything you need to hook up your VW for a reasonable cost.

The trips to the mechanic aren't bad at all because I don't have any. This car is built to last. The only downside to this is that when you do have a problem with the car it is usually bad news, so it can cost a lot to fix.

If you like this car then maybe it is worth looking at the GTI it is basically the same as the Jetta only in a hatchback. I actually like the GTI a little more though.

Other than that I am really not all that sure what to write about, but I would like to stress that all my opinions given are absolutely honest and are what I truly believe. In saying that I hope that you purchase this car because you will get as much joy out of it that I have. Despite those cheesy commercials they produce.

PS amount i payed includes the fact that it was modified with a better sound system, racing clutch, and nuespeed intake.So take this into account when you see the prices they should be.
