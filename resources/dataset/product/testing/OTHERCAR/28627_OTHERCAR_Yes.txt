            I bought this truck because I was sick of buying used cars that always broke down. I've always wanted a truck and the compact trucks were too small and the full size, well you get the idea. 
Believe it or not but the first 30,000 miles on this truck were put on in Europe. I'm in the military and was stationed in Germany when I bought it. The truck handled the German Autobahns and the small winding roads wonderfully. 
I'm back in the US now, and I have taken a long road trip from Delaware to Texas. Very comfortable and smooth ride depending on the roads themselves. 
With any truck the more cargo you have the better they ride.
The only problems I've had is the rear brake lines were recalled. On cold, wet mornings they would keep locking up until they were warmed up. The local Dodge dealer fixed it. I also had a small rust spot on the front bumper appear during the first year. It was fixed right away but I noticed the other day it was coming back.
I plan on getting a camping trailer within the next year or so. I need to find something less than a 5000 GVWR unless I can figure out how to boost the towing capacity.
I have a 5 speed manual transmission. So far I've had no problems with it or the clutch. I was surprised because I'm known for going through clutches very quickly.
