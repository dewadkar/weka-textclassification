            Last week my husband and I purchased a new 2000 model Jeep Cherokee Freedom.  The Freedom is pretty much the same things as the Sport model, but you get a full size spare, aluminum rims, a different grill on the front and a Solar Yellow color option. Yellow you say? It looks awesome with tinted windows and there is NO way you will loose your vehicle in a parking lot!

We went with the automatic transmission, added tinted windows, CD player and fog lamps.  It rides much smoother than I was expecting and there is room for me to lean back, put my legs forward and relax while riding along.  My husband has no problem with leg room, and he is six feet tall.  We have two kids and both of them have plenty of room for their legs and feet and space in between them.  

As of yet we haven't needed to tow anything, but we did get the tow package just in case.  I would recommend getting this option for that very reason. You never know when you might need to tow something and it's better to have the option available than just skipping over it period.

This is a fun vehicle, has lots of room and is easy to change into 4 wheel drive.  I was a little intimidated about switching it to 4 wheel drive, but you just reach down and pull the lever.  So easy! 

I would recommend the Jeep Cherokee Sport/Freedom  if you are looking into buying an SUV.  You get alot for what you pay for and Jeep is a great brand!
