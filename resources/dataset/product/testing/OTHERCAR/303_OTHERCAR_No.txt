            I decided to take a long look at this car(SUV) in my recent search for a quality new vehicle.  I am a college student and the looks of the car certainly impressed me so I made up my mind to take a test drive at my local dealership this weekend.  The results of this endeavor were somewhat displeasing, so therefore I decided not to purchase the car and keep looking.  This evaluation certainly is not saying that this vehicle isn't without its merits, it's just that I felt that I could find a car more suitable for me in the long run.

Let me first describe the benefits that the Xterra has to offer.  First of all, as I already mentioned, the looks of the car are appealing.  I felt a bit classier in this vehicle driving down the freeway than I usually do in the 1989 model car that I currently own.  Furthermore, upon entrance to the vehicle, I found that the interior was stylish, roomy and comfortable.  I am a tall individual and I found the headroom to be ample and the seats to be large enough for the vast majority of drivers.

The ride the Xterra offered was very smooth indeed.  The cab barely even nudged as I went over several speed bumps in an apartment complex.  Also, I noticed that at higher speeds there was very little noise as conversation was easily heard and free-flowing throughout this particular drive between members in the front and rear of the vehicle.  Furthermore, I have heard that the Xterra has performed fairly well in crash testing and is considered to be a safe vehicle.

With all of these pros in mind it would be hard to believe that I wasn't instantly totally smitten with this stylish auto.(which I wasn't)  The reason for this is the fact that the vehicle has very little power.  I noticed that while on the freeway speeds of 65 mph or more were almost unreachable unless the petal was slammed to the floor.  Now, to be fair, I did have 2 other passengers in the vehicle with me; however, I have certainly seen many vehicles with much more power than the Xterra.  It was truly one of the slowest vehicles that I have driven.  This lead me to the conclusion that I was not ready at this time to buy this vehicle being that I spend most of my time in a large city and need a car with a great deal of pick-up while driving on the often dangerous freeway.  Furthermore, the handling, while not bad, was not of superior quality. 

All in all, this is not a bad buy for around $22,000 with some features.  I just could not afford to buy a nice looking car with little power.  If you drive mainly back roads and have no real need for speed then I would recommend this car to you, otherwise look elsewhere.<br><br>
