            This was my second digital camera, after having owned an HP PhotoSmart C200 camera for three years, prior to purchasing the Kodak in December 2002.  My wife said it was time to move up from a 1 megapixel camera to at least a 3 megapixel camera.  We looked around, and decided on the Kodak DX4330, along with the EasyShare Camera Dock II.

I like the camera real well, don't get me wrong, but it has its shortcomings.  One, it doesn't do low light conditions at all.  I have been in several venues (school gymnasiums, auditoriums, etc.) where I tried to use the optical zoom to take a picture, only to realize that the auto focus will not work due to low light.

Another pet peeve is that, to review pictures that you have already taken, you have to remove the lens cap and turn the camera on, which extends the zoom lens (this is a poor design).  Also, the lens cap tends to come off when the camera is in the case.  This sounds like a bad thing, but can actually be a good thing, because the camera can also be accidentally turned on (I did this once when attempting to insert it into a case).  Thank goodness, when the zoom lens extends, the motor has plenty of power to pop the lens cap off.

In good lighting conditions (especially sunlight), you can't beat it.  I've taken many a great, sharp picture with true color reproduction.  In fact, after school pictures didn't turn out for my oldest son, I took him to a nearby lake and made pictures of him, which turned out better than any school picture we've had of him.

I agree with some of the reviewers, you could probably get by without the camera dock.  However, it keeps me from having to remember where I left my battery charger and my USB cable.  Two less things to carry in my camera bag.
