            I just bought this car from my brother-in-law a few months ago. It has about 130,000 miles on it and it still runs like new. It rides like a brand new car. Before this I had Dodge Daytona, and well, I'll admit it was very sporty but rode like a brick. You can imagine the change when I started driving this car. 

Power is not lacking in this car. It is the LX model with the 2.5 ltr 
V-6. the acceleration is very smooth and quick. Hardly any torque steer. This car is a 5 spd which helps on gas mileage. I can get 19mpg in town and on the road I can get as much as 30mpg, unheard of with a 6 cylinder. The only drawback to the bigger engine is the way it jerks when you first take off, like a plane touching down.

The interior could use improvements in the seats. Just a tad to hard. Everything is placed within easy reach. Radio, heater, winshield wiper, and turn signals are well designed and placed with the consumer in mind, not the cost of putting it there. The factory moonroof is very quiet whether it is open or closed. The backseats can actually fit three people there, wow. 

This car is the best one I owned yet. Power, comfort, ride, and most of all it looks good to. If you the chance to pick one up, do so, you will not be disappointed at all.<br><br>
