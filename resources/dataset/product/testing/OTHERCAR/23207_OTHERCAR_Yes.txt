            Overall, the Accord is a very solid vehicle--reliable, fairly trouble-free, logicaly placed instrumentation, and good gas mileage. My sole complaint is the comfort of the seats. Perhaps out of a desire for durability, Honda designed these seats to be very stiff--which means very uncomfortable, especially on long-trips. Many people opt for some sort of lower back support. On the EX trim line, the seats include lumbar support, as well as a much more powerful (and gas-guzzling) V-6 engine. My only problems with my car have been in having leaves enter into the ventilation system. This caused condensation to leak on the floor mats. The repair cost was over $200, most likely because the dealership was somewhat untrustworthy.
