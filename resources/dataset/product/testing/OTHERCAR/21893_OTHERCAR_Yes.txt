            First time I drove this car, my heart was literally beating faster.  If you love to drive, and don't often have rear seat passengers, this is about as close to perfection as you get.  If you have kids or often ferry people around in the back seat, I would suggest looking elsewhere, as the only drawback to this car is the lack of rear seat room.

I would also suggest opting for the premium stereo system, especially for the audiophiles.  The 10 speaker system is absolutely incredible, and I have no qualms about the extra $30 a month it added to the lease price.

If you're shopping for cars in this price range, I would assume you would look at the Mercedes E class as well.  I did, and was quite disappointed.  The difference in price is minimal, however the lease rates are substantially higher for the Mercedes.  In addition, the ride in the Mercedes is about as boring as you get.  

Trust me on this one.  If you don't have to worry about the room, you will not be sorry you bought this car.  <br><br>
