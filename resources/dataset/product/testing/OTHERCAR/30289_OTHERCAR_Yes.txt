            Have had my Saturn SW2 for a few months and just LOVE it!  And the dealer has shown such wonderful customer service!  They were friendly, courteous and helpful and they continue to be.  I had to buy a new car since my old one was going to die on me soon.  The Saturn SW2 caught my eye and once I went to the dealer, test drove, learned more about the car, and was treated so nicely, I had them do up he paperwork and found that I could afford it and was sold!  I'm planning on having kids in the next few years and this will definitely be a great family car.  Plus, though it is a wagon, it is not overly large in size.  I actually find it is shorter than my old Honda Accord.  Those used to a car will take some time getting used to the fact that there is no trunk, but to me that just means less junk to pile in a trunk.  My SW2 came with a CD, tape, stereo which is very nice.  Also, I have the standard Saturn alarm system on it.  It's nice to just be able to push a button on my keychain and not have to insert a key into the door.  I even took the car back to the dealer and had them reprogram it so that it would be passive (comes on without my intervening).<br><br>
