                 Toyota trucks and cars have some of the best reputations on the markets today. Reliability, pricing, and how long they can last are among the deciding factors in the minds of those Americans that buy Camry's, Corrolla's and Tacoma's everyday. The Toyota Siena is no exception. 
     Of course everybody has heard reviews about its brand new safety features, excellent steering and handling for a van of its size, and powerful new engine, but how many of you possible Siena investors are PARENTS? Sure buying a van due to its capability and handling may seem like a perfectly decent reason to many of you, but you parents have to ask yourself one question. How would you like to be stuck for the next 10 years in a living hell, your kids going on and on in an endless tirade about  how &quot;I'm cramped, Daddy,&quot; or how &quot;Mikey's hitting me with his seat belt again,&quot; or even about how &quot;I can't fit my freekin' bike in the trunk, dad; jeez, I told you we should have bought a  Town and Country!&quot; Well here is a review from a passengers point of view.
     As far as basic comfort features go, all Siena's are equipped with standard air, power windows, and a nifty radio controller on the steering wheel which eliminates the drivers need to keep pressing buttons on the dashboard to find the Larry Elder show when those kids in the back seat keep whining to put on some decent Metallica(believe me, it happens). There are also cup holders for every seat, including ones which fold in for the two front seats, which is a nice addition to every model, not just the LE or XLE. Excellent speakers and an easy-to-work-with radio provide a great sound system to all models, and a keyless entry is another new and high-tech feature which makes Siena a better value. (The only problem with the keyless entry is that it is truly keyless; when a key is used, the alarm goes off (not to worry, you can get that disabled upon request for no extra charge)). A fold in middle seat is especially handy on the long road trips to Vegas when the kids need to stretch their legs, and shoulder-harness seat belts provide a safer ride than the old-fashioned waist belts. 
     On the LE and XLE models, the two sliding passenger doors are a really useful feature once you realize that you don't have to wait for grandma to take her slow sweet time getting out of the car while you sit and rot and wait impatiently to hit the buffet at the Rio before the foods all gone. On the latter two models, a more advanced alarm system, a built in Lo-Jack (also upon request) and a weather panel make the Siena a really wonderful ride.  My advice: cough up the extra couple grand and spring for the LE or XLE , although the CE is still a fine addition to anyones garage. 
     Problems? The shoulder seat belts can get annoying at times as one either has to step over them  to get out of the car, or keep on inserting and reinserting them into the hole. Also, the trunk has less space than that of other van's, such as the Previa, or a Doge Grand Caravan, but the hefty middle-seat section makes up for than. Also, dealers can get a little pricey when it comes to certain models, so shop around first. All in all, a great deal from all points of view.
