            What a car!  My family and I just love this car.  Get a load of some of these features:

- drop down dvd/tv screen in the back to occupy the kids
- rear radar detector beeps if you are about to back into anything
- handsfree telephone controls integrated into the car
- great navigation system
- storage compartment/table in the back seat for the kid's toys
- seat air conditioner that blows air up your butt - why?!

Ok, so I'm not crazy about the air up my butt seat, but my wife loves it for some reason.  Fortunately it has a control knob on the side of the seat and you can turn it up or down as you like.  My wife always has hers on full blast so I have to turn it off whenever I get in her seat.  The whole family truly enjoys and has fun with this car.

The downsides?  Well this is both good and bad, but this SUV is HUGE. It's based on the F-150 truck frame (but handles better thankfully) so it is mammoth.  The downside is that you may have difficulty fitting it in your garage, particularly if you have an older home.  Our home is fairly new with a spacious garage and this beast just BARELY fits, both in length and in height, it maxs out all of the available room.  The good news is that my wife and kids can actually stand up in the back of this SUV when they need to which just gives you added mobility and room to manuever particularly when you are tending to the kids.  The other downside of course with all of this mass is that the fuel economy is next to nil, but the large tank gives you plenty of range between fill ups. However take a sandwich and a bucket of money every time you fill up because you will be there for awhile.

This is a great car for families with kids.

Good Luck,
