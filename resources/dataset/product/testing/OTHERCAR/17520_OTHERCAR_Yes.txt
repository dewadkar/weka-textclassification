            I've owned my 2001, 325i BMW for almost 3 years now.  Am I happy I paid a little more for my vehicle than other cars I researched?  Definitely yes.  The way to get your spouse to let you purchase the car.  Get them in a test drive and take it out on the freeway.  The car has excellent sound damping, a quality stereo system, and is a joy to cut in and out amongst the "other" cars trudging along.  After 3 years behind the wheel it's really not pleasant to drive my friends' cars.

One of my favorite aspects of the car is the accessibility of the controls.  Everything from stereo volume to the onboard computer require little movement from the steering wheel and little to no eye movement from the road.  Almost every aspect of the car is designed to keep your attention on the task at hand.

The 325 engine is very adequate for the car, although I am a fan of the extra horsepower the 330 provides.  If you've got the extra 7 or so grand, go for it; otherwise the 325 is a great engine with good pick up off the line.  Top speed with the governor removed is about 140.  The car handles extremely well aerodynamically at speeds up to about 120mph (watch for the fuzz).  I do a pretty even mixture of freeway and city driving and have maintained a pretty constant 25 miles per gallon.  On just freeway driving it goes up to around 29 to 30.  Pure city driving will take you down into the low 20s.

The standard exhaust is very quiet.  If you'd like a little louder sports car sound you'll need to upgrade to a free flow exhaust and perhaps a cold air intake.

Brakes and stopping power are impressive.  I have to be careful driving other vehicles now due to the difference in brakes.  But you might want to look into some sort of wheel cleaning kit to keep the rims free of the brake dust that collects rather quickly.

As far as options....

The premium package is very nice.  
-Automatic climate control is very responsive and provides one less thing to worry about while enjoying the drive.  
-The automatically dimming rear and side view mirrors are a definite plus for the annoying SUV headlights in your eyes.
-Leather seats are very comfortable, even on longer drives.
-Wood trim looks nice, but I would actually prefer the standard trim.

The sports package really makes cornering fun.
If you're in the market for a bimmer, you're probably interested in the added performance of the sport package.  
-The suspension is dropped about an inch.
-Larger 17" rims and performance tires look really nice.
-Fog lights are mainly just cosmetic for night driving.

Cold weather package is nice in really cold areas and for girls.
My girlfriend is a big fan of the heated seats and it allows me to keep the air a little cooler for myself without her complaining about freezing to death.

The premium audio mainly adds some nice base to the car's stereo.  Perhaps not worth the extra money if you'd rather look into some high end after market additions.

I've driven both the automatic and the manual transmissions and am pleased with both.  Performance doesn't really suffer with their automatic, so just go with what you're comfortable with.

The all wheel drive is about the only thing I wish I would have purchased.  I drive in a lot of snow and the car handles very poorly with rear wheel drive and the performance tires.  The all wheel drive is a must if you do any kind of snow driving.

I've had no maintenance problems with the car, but any that do occur are expensive after the 4 year warranty expires.

Servicing the vehicle is relatively inexpensive since they recommend an oil change only every 15,000 miles or once a year.  I change mine more often myself though just to be on the safe side.
