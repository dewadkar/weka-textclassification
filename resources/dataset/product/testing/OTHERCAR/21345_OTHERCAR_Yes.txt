            Almost everyone in the country has one, so why don't you?  The Toyota Camry has an excellent combination of both a sporty feel and being an excellent family car for a great price.  Five adults can fit in the Camry very comfortably because it is much roomier than it may appear.  Consumer Reports even recommended it because of its low price and great repair history. This car handles perfectly and with the optional 3.0 liter, 194 horse power V6 engine it accelerates very quickly.  It comes with many options including a spoiler, which I highly recommend, that gives the Camry a much more sporty look.  The XLE package is a bit expensive, so I would recommend getting the LE package.  My personal favorite color combination is black with real gold trim.  This car even comes with a standard CD player, which should be on all cars.  My friends are constantly trying to borrow my Camry because it really is that great of a car.     <br><br>
