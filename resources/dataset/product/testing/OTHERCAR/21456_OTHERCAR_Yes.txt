            I purchased a 2001 new Spyder Convertible because it looked great, had a great, very peppy 4 cylinder engine, a back seat so my dog could ride along, and a good warranty. The car has exceeded all of my expectations; it is quiet, solid, and climbs the Arizona mountains in 5th gear with no problem. It corners and handles fantastically; they have re-engineered the whole car and I think they did a great job.  It is getting 30 mph in the city and higher on the highway. Even in our intense heat here in the desert the car's air conditioner does just fine. I really recommend this car to alot of drivers who want a reasonably priced convertible. I bought the basic one with no options,5 speed manual transmission, cloth seats etc.  However it is very nicely equipped with a great sound system and the MSP was 23,800 including transportation. It is just a real fun car to drive and the quality seems very good. The only persons to whom I would not recommend this car are those who need a spatious, comfortable back seat, this one is good only for kids and pets; and also persons who have a hard time getting into and out of a car as the Spyder is low slung and somewhat  difficult for elderly persons etc. to get in and out as any low slung car would be. For all others, even those up in the cold country the convertible is great as it even has a defroster on the glass rear window. <br><br>
