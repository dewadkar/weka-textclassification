            I'm not going to write too much on this but what I have to say is very important.

First of all, this camera is all about <b>portability</b>.  It is roughly the size of 1.5 decks of cards stacked on each other.  You can't get them any smaller with this combo of features.  Couple its size with the stainless body, and you have a winning combination.    

The picture quality is above average and can be tweaked with the onboard settings.  I've taken everything from macro shots to a rather serene scene at work (contact me and i'll send a picture to you). 

For those who want to know the features of the camera:
Body: Stainless steel, plastic doors.

CCD: 2.1MP

Zoom: 2X optical, 4x digital

Battery: LI-ion (about 80 medium res shots)

Resolution output (offers no uncompressed mode): 
1600x1200 (about 1.5mb)
1600x1200 (about 500kb)
640x480 (about 70kb)
On a 48mb CF card I can shoot almost 300 low res pictures.
 
Adjustments: Delayed shutter, continuous mode (2-3fps), macro, exposure settings, white balance, flash on, flash off, sunlight fill, 

In the Box: Camera, 8mb memory card (CF type 1), strap, software, manual, battery, charger, CF and battery cases.

This review isn't really about features of the camera, it is what you can do with it.  I've taken over 4000 pictures with it because of its size.  Its been in clubs, casino's, rollercoasters, underground, EVERYWHERE!!  If you take anything away from this review, take this:

Features and picture quality mean squat if you're not going to use the camera.  The Canon S100 (and its replacement the s110) is an unconsious carry item.  It will go anywhere you will. 

You only live once, and consequently can usually capture the moments once... 


<b>update!</b>
Now, canon has introduced the S110 which is almost the same camera but... adds <b>VIDEO!!!</b>.  Same form factor!
