            I have been an Audi Lessee since 1999, my first Audi was the A4, in 2000 I leased a TT and in 2001 a convertible TT Roadster.  I must say that all of these cars handled beautifully and were so much fun to drive!

Even though I enjoyed the ride, the TT convertible seemed to have some problems with the electrical system.  In the two plus years that I drove the car, it was in the dealer's shop more times than not.  I only put a total of 17,000 miles on the car before I traded it in because of the amount of time the car was unavailable to me.

In those two years the instrument cluster was replaced twice, and various other relay switches, the inside trunk control and the switch for the convertible top were replaced as well.  There were days where I would come out to the car and the windows had just opened by themselves and would not close unless the top was opened and re-closed.  

The straw that broke the camel's back happened right before we turned the car in, it left my husband stranded with no gas, but yet registered over a 1/4 tank.  The dealership service department actually had the audacity to tell me to fill up the tank and drive it like that for a few days, going by mileage and filling the tank up again every 170 miles!  

I was told by the dealership that although this was unusual for the Audi TT Roadster he had heard of other cases where there seemed to be problems with the instrument cluster.

The car itself was a great drive.  The engine purred, although in Winter it did idle a little funny, but my understanding is that this has something to do with the change in gas during the winter months.  A full tank usually gave me about 200 miles, so it is really economical on gas.

I could stop on a dime, the breaks worked well and did not make a sound.  What I loved most was how the car responded when you shifted gears.  They were really smooth and allowed me to control the speed of the car with ease.  I was able to quickly accelerate when I needed to and then stop very quickly without a problem.

I am a petite woman, 5'2'' tall and had no problems with the way the pedals were spaced.  Some of my friends, who were much taller thought it was a little awkward to drive. The seats are adjustable and even elevate for those of us who are not very tall. 

The only complaint my husband had about the car was that it was not the most comfortable ride on long drives because you feel all of the bumps in the road.  It didn't bother me at all, but it is a much bumpier ride than my husband's SUV.  The cars was also great on turns, it hugged the road and the steering wheel is nice and tight. Even when taking turns at high speeds in the rain, the car stuck to the road and did not veer from the course you set.

I don't know if others have experienced these issues with the 2001 Audi TT Roadster, but I wanted to let people know that it can happen.  

All in all though, I do not regret my decision to lease Audi's and just recently picked up the 2004 A4 Quattro.  I love the service deal, for the duration of my lease the car is serviced top to bottom by the dealership at no cost to me!  They wash your car every time they service it.  They give you a loaner car, even if they are just changing your oil.  Unless I see the same issues pop up with this car, I will probably lease from them again.
