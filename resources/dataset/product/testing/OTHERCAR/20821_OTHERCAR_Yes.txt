            I read all the magazine reviews, read the shoot outs, test drove the Accord (nice car, no soul), drove the Camry (nice car my Mom likes it), Drove the Altima (Nice car a lot more expensive, fit and finish did not impress me)....  The Mazda 6 does something when you look at it, it lights you up...  I spent the day and arrived early at my Mazda dealer.  I just bought an MPV about 2 months ago and my Protege 5 was 2 years old.  The dealer knew that I wasn't wasting anyones time and gave me my sales guy for a while who was a big help..  The plain jane version of the I or S models looked boring...  I NEEDED the skirts and Spoilers!  I drove the 4 and 6 cyl models, tested each with the auto and stick.  After my wife reminded me I drive 80 miles a day in traffic I stuck with the sportomatics.  The 6 needed some revs to get running, the 4 felt spritly at slower speeds.  Don't get me wrong the 6 will smoke the 4. The one thing that is surprising is how nice the 4 is.  I traded a 2000 Accord SE 4 against my MPV and just sold the Pro5 w/a 4 cyl.  This 4 is the smoothest 4 I've driven.  Quiet and not buzzy.  I decided on a auto 4 fairly loaded up.  My only requirement was NO HOOP SPOILER!  The hoop looks like a cast off from JC Whitney.  I found a nice dark grey 4 cyl loaded with a trunk lip spoiler.  I just sold my 2002 Protege 5 which was a nice but small car.  The first thing you notice is how nice the interior is.  Everything is where you expect it to be.  Nice supportive seats, the power option made it easy to find the "spot".  Easy to read gauges, easy to use switch gear.  The car felt very BMW 330ish.  The trunk is HUGE.  The engine is very smooth and responsive but not a road rocket.  It kind of glides rather then dashes.  The tiptronic like auto makes the trip a little more spirited.  Brakes are sure and smooth, steering is as you would expect.  The car cruises at 80 and you think your going 55.  When I bought the Protege 5 the kids thought dad was cool until they sat in the back.  This car is cool and comfy, not as cool as my 67 Stingray Roadster but I can't take that to work either...  Bottom line is the car does what you expect it do, has panache', AND unlike most asian cars, this car has soul.  The best way to describe it is if BMW put out a 2 series, this would be it.  Is this perfect, nah...  My biggest complaint is I have large feet (size 13) and sometimes I nip the side of the brake pedal. The stereo is ok but theres no way to upgrade this aftermarket.  All in all, I 'd give this a solid 8.8 of 10..
