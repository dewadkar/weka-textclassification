            After the birth of my daughter, I had been wanting to purchase a digital camera. After some research I had set my mind on the Canon Powershot S230 as I wanted a solid yet compact camera. The Fujifilm A101 was recommended to me by a friend as it was cheap but produced good quality pictures.
My first impression was that it was a bit "plasticky" and would not give me the quality of photos I wanted, but after trying it out I soon realised it had all the features I needed with good quality pictures too!

<b>What you get</b>

The camera comes with software to download your pictures onto a PC, a USB cable to connect the two, a 8MB smartmedia card (stores your pics) and a handstrap.
This is quite a basic package, a power adaptor and a case would be nice, but you can't complain too much for the price.

<b>Features</b>

You can take pictures with or without the LCD, using it will drain the batteries.
<p>
You have two picture formats one is the Fine-normal-basic mode (1280x960 pixels) or Normal (640x480 pixels) this determines the quality but also the number of shots available on the smartmedia card. You can take a lot more shots in normal mode but with less resolution. This all depends on the kind of pictures you are taking.
<p>
There is a movie mode, which takes 20 seconds of film at a time. This is a nice bonus but don't expect too much from it. It does take up a lot of memory and there is no sound.
<p>
The flash has a good reloading time so you don't have to wait in between taking pictures. This is great as some of the cameras in the same category take a while to reload.
<p>
One of the down points is that there is no manual zoom but there is the standard 2X digital zoom and a 4X zoom in movie mode. 
<p>
There are a few more advanced features like different flash modes and being able to control the white balance but these are not essential if you are a beginner and just want to take photos.
<p>
The computer software is easy to use and the downloading time is very quick, you just plug the USB cable into the camera and your PC and the pictures download within seconds. You can edit your photos, choose your prints and save them on other programs such as MS Photo editor.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I am very happy with this camera. It is so easy to use and provides you with great pictures for the price you pay. It is light and compact and can also be used as a PC camera which is a plus.
On the downside as I mentioned before it really uses batteries up with the LCD on, but makes up for it in other departments.
