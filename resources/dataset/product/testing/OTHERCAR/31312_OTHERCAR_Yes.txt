            I have been a Pontiac owner for over ten years now. I purchased a Pontiac Grand Am in 1991.I have truly enjoyed my car, but have also been very disappointed in it at times. It drives well and has room enough for what I need. I have had to replace quite a few things on it, but I don't think I blame that on the car. I live on an island with only 30 miles of road and it seems as though all the driving here is to or from the store, which is only 3 miles away. That is bad on any kind of car. Also there is really no open road to get on. On the whole it has been pretty good. The only real complaint I have is in the exhaust system. I have had to replace it once a year since I have owned it. That could be caused by the climate I live in. Since owning my Pontiac Grand Am, I have noticed that they now are manufactured with stainless steel exhaust systems. That only tells me that I am not the only one who has had problems with the exhaust system. On the whole I have really enjoyed my car, and when purchasing again, Pontiac will be considered.<br><br>
