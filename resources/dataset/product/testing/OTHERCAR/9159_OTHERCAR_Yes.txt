            My wife bought this incredibly inexpensive car when she was in school.  The car proved to be very reliable with awesome mileage ( more than 40 MPG on highway  when tuned ).  The car was surprisingly peppy -- more so than other subcompacts like the Toyota Tercel.  Fun to drive with manual.

At 95k miles, the car was running great, but alas it was totalled by an SUV driver who ran a red light while talking on a cell phone (no joke).  Until that point, the only unplanned maintanence expense was CV joints ($600).  Note: when worn-out, these joints squeak when you turn sharply.

This car was really loved by my wife, however I must note the the appearance of car is now dated.  The subcompact hatchback genre has passed largely out of favor, concurrent with the rise of the car-crushing, gas-guzzling SUVs (sold to paranoid suburban mothers).  You can expect that most "affluent" drivers no longer consider the 323 to be a sensible "adult" car.  Well nuts to them.  Wear your seatbelt!!!
