            I bought my 1998 Mystique LS brand new in January of 98.  I had it for 2 years, and finally traded it in because I had it in the shop 13 times in 2 years.  It was too bad because the car had a lot of good qualities.

The Mystique LS has a 24 valve engine that has a lot of acceleration power.  It accelerates and handles like a sports car, but it was much more comfortable than most sports cars, and it has 4 doors, which is a plus to me.

Unfortunately, I had 4 recalls to fix electrical problems.  I also had to take the car in 3 times to fix the automatic trunk release.  The dome light and warning chime intermittently didn't work, and the speedometer, which is electric, intermittently didn't work.  The dealer could not fix either problem.  I talked to a 98 Ford Contour owner who has the same problem with his dome light and warning chimes, so that problem and the recalls are not unique to my car.  

Also, the body is designed in such a way that the bottom door panels are prone to chipping.  I convinced my dealer to repaint the chips and install mud flaps.  I've noticed that nearly all Mystiques and Contours are badly chipped along the bottom panel.

At least all of the problems were minor, and the car always started and drove well.  However, it is very inconvenient to take a car into the shop, and I got fed up.<br><br>
