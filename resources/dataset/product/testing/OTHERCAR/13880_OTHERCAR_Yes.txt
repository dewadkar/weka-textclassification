            I'm 18 and I live in Washington, USA. I have a 1991 Hyundai Excel 3 DR Hatchback. I got it in October of 1998. I just wrecked my Jeep and desperately needed a car for school. I was looking into Honda Civic's mainly, or whatever I could really find in my price range. I came across this Excel at a dealer and it was the cheapest car they had and it was on sale as a special. I checked it out, test drove it. It was alright. I didn't mind it much. It had 2 previous owners and it was pretty stock, the only thing on it that wasn't was the Wheels. I think the last owner of the car was a kid and stuck some wheels on it. After I test drove it, it seems fine so I bought it. It was a Hyundai, never heard anything about them.

When I went to school with it everyone was making fun of me cause it wasn't a Honda. It has been getting great gas mileage, and the only thing I've had a problem with was the clutch which had to be replaced. I've heard things that Hyundai's have clutch problems, but no matter, my friend's Honda had to replace the clutch too so its doing alright. I bought the car with 70,000 miles, I'm up to 93,000 miles now and a clutch being the only problem I've had, I'm doing good for a 10 year old car! I replaced the muffler about 3 months ago to a high-performance muffler and that improves the gas mileage a bit, and gives more horsepower.

The one thing I do complain about over all for a normal person, this car has alot of power and torque. Starting off at lights I used to spin the tires every time I drove, but I've gotten the hang of it. I have been driving my car a little harder lately to prove to people a Hyundai is Faster than a Honda, I've been participating in Street Racing around in my area and there aren't many Hyundai's. As far as I know there is only mine and 2 others, and the others are Accent's. I have raced a few Civics and beat them, so what do I have to say about Hyundai's? They're the coolest! I hear the newer the Hyundai the more reliable.. So I guess for a final saying &quot;Either you love them or you hate them.&quot;<br><br>
