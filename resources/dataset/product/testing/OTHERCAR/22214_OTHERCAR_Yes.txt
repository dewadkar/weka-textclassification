              Pros:
For starters, the Axiom is totally unique in terms of looks. It is an SUV that will actually turn heads (nobody knows what it is yet). It is a tremendous value that should also hold its resale well. I got my 4x4 loaded with every option except leather for $28,000, including 0.0% financing. This thing is FAST. The Power shift mode holds the gears perfectly and really compliments the high performance engine. The "TOD" traction control is great and kicks in seamlessly. It has an extremely tight turning radius like that of a car so it's very easy to park. The brakes feel perfect. Finally, the interior and amenities are very nice and very car-like.    
 
  Cons:
For all the active suspension control, etc., this thing still has a very jolting ride. They should have used car-like unibody construction instead of a typical truck ladder frame. Although the interior looks great, it is very plasticky (especially the dash) and not what you should get for a $30k vehicle. The seats aren't high enough off the floor; it feels like you're sitting Indian-style. The stereo sounds very "hollow", it is not acoustically pleasing. I wish the doors would open just by grabbing the inside handle instead of having to flick the switch. Audible drivetrain vibration around 2200 rpm (happens to be crusing speed).    
 
  Overall Review:
Overall, this vehicle is a great "crossover" of truck-like ruggedness with car-like amenities and styling, and it is a terrific value when you compare it to other SUVs. After more than 500 miles so far, there seems to be very little bugs to work out for a first-year vehicle. Isuzu has done most of the comparison shopping for you if you check out their Web site. I can tell they designed this vehicle to be just a little better feature-wise than almost every SUV out there for the price. For $5k-$8k more you can definitely get an SUV with a more sophisticated car-like ride and handling, otherwise, if you can deal with the truck-like roughness sometimes, you'll feel good about what you paid.
