            I had a 1988 Hyundai Excel that needed replaced.  We searched all over, on the net and local dealers.  I saw the 1999 models on the Hyundai web site and fell in love all over again.  My 88 was very dependable and had some spunk, but when we drove the new 99 Elantra, I felt we were in a sports car.  My son has a late model Mustang that hangs in the curves, and I can honestly say this car hangs right with it.  One of the first times we took a trip with the Elantra my wife did one wild and crazy evasive maneuver to miss a piece of truck tire in the roadway, other vehicles I have had would have turned over immediately but the car responded like a champ and kept us heading to our destination without incident or accident. Really, it has a good power pack under the hood and is a very comfortable ride.  We got extras, such as, sun roof (that tilts and controlled by power to open and shut), CD player, all power, upgraded sound, automatic transmission, tilt and other extras that I'm sure I have forgotten.  We still only paid right at $14000 and were real pleased compared to similar models.  My wife has driven this car for 23,000 miles since April 1999 with no problems.  If more people would test drive the Hyundai, there would be more on the road that what you see now.  America, you are missing out on a good product.  Good job Korea!
