              We bought this '93 Tercel DLX because my '86 Honda Civic had passed away.

 I love the gas mileage, especially now that prices are so high. I can fill up for about $11.55. (that's at $1.56 per gallon)
 I make numerous trips to Green Bay,WI which is about 115 miles from me, so that's about 230 miles round trip. And I use MAYBE a half a tank. I would still have enough gas to get back without filling up. But for safety reasons ( and intelligent ones) I fill up. Then I only have to put about $5.50.

 The heater is the best. Heats up really good.
Although I put a different radio/cassette player in the factory radio was alright. 
  The car is small enough though that the 2 speakers that came with the car gave me enough sound to crank the tunes occasionally. :)

  I have a 5 speed,, which is really great. I love to drive manual cars. Faster pick up and easier on gas. ( I think)

   Although when I bought it it did have 117,000 some miles on it.I now put an additional 33,000 on it. I make sure that I have my car tuned up every 6months along with regular oil changes, and tires checked. This is an absolute way to prolong the life of any car.

   I am  also a part time mechanic.
Which saves us a ton of money on all our auto expenses.

   I love my Tercel. What can I say.

   There is a roomy trunk, but don't expect to move anyone with this one.
The back seats fold down which is  a nice feature. 
  
    There is a nice front leg/head room. But this car is not meant to carry any adults in the back. Unless you are a child you may not like to sit in the back. Unless the people in the front keep their seats pretty close to the front there isn't much leg room  in the rear.

   Another con with this car is the way the seats FLY forward when you open it to let someone in the back seat. I know, it hit me in the head a few times ( while my dear wife laughed) I cursed the seat. :)
 
   There is a lever for both the gas and trunk doors. I like this, cause  I occasionally run errands for my family/friends and when dropping stuff at their homes I can pop the trunk and they can grab thier things without me turning the car off.

  The car has a very quiet ride. The ride itself is nice and smooth. Not that it's a Cadillac. 

  The heat/ac controls are easy to use and access while driving.
As well as the wipers,lights which are located where the turn signals are. They to are easy to use.

   The rear window defroster is also a nice addition. I like that this car has powersteering. My Civic had none.

   The price of the small parts to the car were pretty fair and reasonable. But if I can buy it at a junk yard I will. It's always cheaper. Unless its a  carburator, starter something that you may want to purchase from a store, this way you can return it in case a problem arises with it.
    Oil filter, air filter, spark plugs, muffler, gas caps. Are the only parts that I had to replace so far.


   I would not hesitate to purchase a Tercel again.

   I would recommend this car for a used car purchase, for the first time car owner (to all you parents with teens) they will like this one. It's quick, nimble, easy on the pocket book as far as gas and parts go. The style of the auto to is nice looking.<br><br>
