I first fell in love with this camera when I saw a friend using it.  For the very same reason why I am drawn to the design of an IMac computer or Sony Vaio laptop, I was drawn to the Canon Elph's sleek design and compact size. Ok, ok fashion before function is not exactly a sensible way of spending $499. :) I agree.

Using my friend's camera a few times convinced me to purchase my own when it came time to get one for work.  In my line of work, I need to take photos of products close-up such as capturing the details of jewelry pieces, etc.  I am not a camera expert by far and it was obvious the day I walked into the store and seemed happy to learn that the Canon Elph had a macro feature - and just like that I bought it. 

Had I only used this camera for recreational purposes I think I'd still have it because of it's convenient size and user friendliness.  However, the day came to put the camera to work and I realized that:

1. Even with the macro feature on, the camera was not focusing very clear or close up as hoped. It couldn't get any detail of the jewelry.

2. My battery just died too quickly for comfort. 

Again, keep in mind that I think this would be a great camera for recreational use. My decision to return it was because I just couldn't justify having to re-charge the battery after such few shots each time I had to use it for work (and take 50 shots or more).  

The day I returned it, I made sure to take my time at the store having the customer service rep assist me in trying out MANY different types of models of cameras for my need. I walked away with the Nikon 950.  Regardless of what camera epinions members such as me say you should buy or shouldn't buy, I think the key is to really understand what you'll be using the camera for and taking the time to find a camera that will meet those needs.
