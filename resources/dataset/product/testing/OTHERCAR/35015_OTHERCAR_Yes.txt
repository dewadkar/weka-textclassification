            I bought this car used in 1998 used with approx 110,000 miles on it. It has been an absolute joy to own and operate. With the exception of the final drive that went out this spring, it has been a trouble free and reliable car. Currently has 165,000 and the in-line 5 cylinder is still running stong. Interior holds up very well and doesn't appear to be that of a 13 year old car. Everything is still working as it did new and the leather heated front seats are a treat in our Mid-West winters. This car has also proven to be a tank in the snow. My 90 can plow through bad weather as well as many 4 wheel drives. Only one down-side to owning an Audi new or used : PARTS. If you have an older Audi, parts can sometimes be a challenge to find. And worse yet : part prices. I first realized this when I had to replace my right front headlight - $300 just like that. But, if you maintain your Audi it will give you many, many, many miles of quality trouble-free driving. I love my Audi and would recommend this model to anyone.  If you have a choice, I would opt for the 5 speed manual transmission. I have read that they are better designed than the automatic and make the car much more fun to drive. Overall I rate this as quality German engineering and craftmanship inside and out!!
