            I have owned my 4WD 1990 Chevrolet Suburban for 2 years, now.  I bought it because I own dogs and I travel a lot.  I have been very pleased with my experiences, but there are a few things to look out for when buying one used.

The power train (engine and transmission) has held up very well.  I just turned 203,000 miles on the original power train in my Suburban.  With the popularity of the Chevy 5.7 L engine, parts are not hard to find, and Chevy C/K pickups 1973 to 1986 have the same chassis.  

The down-side of this vehicle involves 1.) The A/C system and 2.) All those little &quot;extra&quot; features that were luxury add-on's at purchase, but have not stood the test of time like the &quot;working&quot; parts of the truck.

The A/C system is poorly designed, with one compressor (under the hood) and a tube running the length of the truck to a blower in the rear.  I had ongoing problems with after factory equipment and non-Dealership installation.  If you have problems, plan to spend $1500 and get it done correctly at the GM certified dealer the first time.

Otherwise, watch for things like the power door locks and power windows going out.  I had to have my temp gauge repaired.  Read the owners manual for interior and parking light replacement.  Some are confusing.

As far as &quot;Utility&quot;, you cannot beat the Suburban.  Mine gets the same gas mileage as a new one, with slightly less horsepower.  I always have plenty of room for everything (and I am surprised how often I need it).  

I constantly receive compliments on the ride quality, and comfort for long road trips.  I wouldn't trade it for anything but a newer Suburban.<br><br>
