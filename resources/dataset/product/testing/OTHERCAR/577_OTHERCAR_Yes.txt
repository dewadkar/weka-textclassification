            I had a light yellow Olds Ninety-Eight Regency that I used as my second car to my 1989 Cadillac Brougham. It had the 403 (6.7 litre) V-8 with 4 bbl Rochester carb. My Olds had just about everything: power seats for both driver and passenger, AM/FM with cassette, A/C, leather, etc. The only options my car lacked were the wire wheel covers and sunroof. The Olds is an extremely well-built car with its full frame, solid steel bumpers, rear-wheel drive, proven V-8 and double-A-arm suspension. To get such quality in an automobile today, one would have to look to the Mercedes S-Class. 

I used this car to make a 24 mile one-way commute for several years and it held up quite well. The car was very comfortable and extremely well handling and certainly could take the abuse of the city streets. 

One of the car's bad characteristics was its tendency to eat brakes. I don't know if this was the fault of the car's design, the harsh city driving environment or my own tendency to ride the brakes. I also had an experience with the battery constantly being drained until I discovered the plastic covering on the hood release cable had worn and the exposed metal cable was resting on one of the battery terminals. The car also got rather mediocre gas mileage. 

By 1990 I racked up 148,000 miles on my Olds. Unfortunately the car was just about destroyed in August of that year when it was plowed-in from behind by a truck. The trunk was pretty much demolished and I couldn't open the right rear door. Amazingly I was able to drive the car for at least three months until I got another second car. I had considered a 1983 Olds Ninety-Eight, but that car was quickly sold by the time I made up my mind and returned to the dealership. 

My ladyfriend is still driving a 1981 Olds Ninety-Eight she purchased new to this day. Another testimonial to what a great car the Oldsmobile is! I'm happy to see that GM decided to revive the Olds nameplate by introducing the beautiful Aurora, Intrigue and Alero rather than let it languish and die like Chrysler did to Plymouth and what Ford may do to Mercury.  <br><br>
