            My husband and I have recently purchased a 2001 Nissan Altima.  Though we haven't had this car long, and there aren't enough miles on it for me to share long term reliability, I do have to say that we are very pleased so far with what our car has to offer.

The model that we have is the GXE Limited Edition Altima

This car is pretty roomy inside for a mid-sized sedan.  One of the biggest problems we have had when looking for a car was finding one that my husband could fit into and drive comfortably.  His 6'5" frame fits well into the drivers seat of this car, and the 8 point power front seat helps him with the comfort he needs for his commute.

While the front seat is equipped with the power seat adjuster, the passenger seat is not, and just has your regular run of the mill lever.

The rear seat folds down, and has a 60/40 split.  and there is an adequate amount of room for transporting bulky items.

This model of the Altima has Dual front airbags.  You can also have the option of side airbags, if you so choose.

Seat Belts are a combo of shoulder and lap belts for all 5 passengers.  Also in the rear seat there are 3 tethers for child restraint seats.  The front seat belts adjust up and down for the comfort and safety of the driver and passenger.

There are 3 odometers the first is the actual mileage of the car and the other 2 are trip odometers.

This car is also equipped with the Nissan Vehicle Immobilizer System (NVIS) The NVIS will not allow the engine to start without the use of a registered NVIS key.

For additional security there is also a vehicle security system.

There is a cornering light that provides extra illumination towards the turning direction.  The light will come on when the turn signal lever is moved to the right or left when the headlights are turned on.

There are 2 power sockets for electric devices such as cell phones, One is on the front dash in near the radio and the other is in the bottom of the center console.

There are 4 cup holders, two in the front seat area in the center console, hidden beneath 2 flap like doors.  The two int he rear seat area are pop out ones.  They don't seem very sturdy, bur held a kids sized soft drink with no problems.

Power windows.  On the drivers side there are controls for the drivers window with a one touch auto roll down and switches for all the other windows as well as the window lock.  Rear seat windows do not roll down all the way.

The sun visors have extenders on both the driver and passenger side that will block the sun all the way to the rearview mirror.

There are 2 map lights up front one for the driver and one for the passenger, both are extremely bright.  These are in addition to the dome light in the center of the vehicle, and also a light in the trunk that illuminates whenever the trunk is opened.

The Altima is equipped with power locks as well as a remote keyless entry that locks and unlocks the doors sets the alarm and opens the trunk.  I really like the feature where when you press the button once the drivers door opens and twice, all the doors open.  I feel this is a good safety issue when alone.  You can also set up the remote to beep the horn once or just blink the lights when locking the doors, depending on your preference.

Child safety locks are located on both rear doors They are little levers that are pushed to the *lock* position to engage.

The trunk space is adequate.  Inside the trunk there is a trunk release.  It is there but at first it wasn't really noticeable to me.

I don;t like that the gas cap isn't attached to the car.  There is a special slot for it when fueling, but I prefer to have it attached.

The A/C works extremely well IMO, and I have yet to try the heater.  There are 4 speed controls for the force of the air, and also options of where you want the air to blow.  You also have the option to re-circulate the air for faster heating and cooling.

This edition of the Altima has an AM/FM radio with preset buttons and a CD player.  The sound is good, but the CD's always play louder than the radio even when set on the same volume.

The tank holds 15 gal. and so far we seem to be getting about 30 MPG so while it's not the greatest, it is certainly not the worst. 

I am impressed with the smooth quiet ride, acceleration speed and the comfort of driving this vehicle.

I feel safe driving in this car and I am very happy with our purchase.
