            It was love at first sight. The bright yellow Lancer caught my eye as I drove past the Mitsubishi dealership on a Saturday morning. I went back to check it out, and drove it home on Monday.

I love the rally-inspired looks. The OZ Racing wheels, while sharp looking, are too small and detract a little from the sporty looks. I can't figure out why Mitsubishi went with 15-inch wheels. If you're going to put a pricey aftermarket manufacturer's wheels on your car, why not go 16 or 17 inches?

The Lancer's ride is very smooth and remarkably quiet for a car in this price range. The boy-racer looks belie the Lancer's laid back personality. It's fun to drive but falls behind the Ford Focus in terms of outright handling. The Lancer's suspension isn't as well sorted and the over-boosted power steering doesn't provide as much feel and feedback. For the most part, these are things that only show up when pushing the car toward its limits and aren't as noticeable in normal driving. The whole car feels nice and rigid, which makes it feel more expensive than it is.

The 2.O liter, four-cylinder engine scoots the car to highway speeds without trouble, but it's not in danger of snapping any necks either. It feels as quick as the Focus despite giving up 10 horsepower to the Ford. The manufacturer claims to have tuned the engine for better mid-range torque, and it makes the difference. But the sportiest of the U.S. Lancers deserves a bit more kick than this.

The interior is more appealing than is typical in Japanese cars. The black interior is set off nicely by the faux-aluminum accents on the dashboard and around the shifter. Another nice touch is the carbon fiber-look fabric surrounding the door handles and window/lock switch areas. The one thing that lets the interior package down is the quality (or lack thereof) of the heat/ac controls. The rotary switches have a cheap, plasticky feel that doesn't match the solid feel of the rest of the car.

Choosing the Mitsubishi Lancer over the similarly priced, but superior handling, Ford Focus is more an emotional decision than an intellectual one. I admit, I fell in love with its looks, but the Lancer's fun-to-drive nature has won me over.
