            I bought my SL over 6 years ago.  It's got almost 150,000 miles on it and shows no signs of quitting on me yet!  It's been very reliable, it's fun to drive, and I think it's cute.  I bought it because I had heard so many good things about the company and its cars (I worked in the automotive industry so I always heard a lot about a lot of cars).  I just fell in love with it when I test drove it.  Now, mine's nothing fancy...I was 19 at the time.  It's just about as basic as they get, but it was comfortable, it had plenty of OOMPH for a little car, and it was the right price.  My experience with the dealer was wonderful too!  NOTHING like my previous, pressure-filled car buying experience.  No one was hounding me to buy this car.  It sold itself.  Also, any time I took it to the dealer for any service or repair, they've been extremely courteous then, too.  If I could, I'd take my van there for service too!  Anyway, 3 kids later, I've become a minivan mom and my Saturn has become my husband's car, but I still love to drive it whenever I get the chance.  I'm sure I'll cry when the day comes that I have to get rid of it.  Oh well, then I can just buy another Saturn!<br><br>
