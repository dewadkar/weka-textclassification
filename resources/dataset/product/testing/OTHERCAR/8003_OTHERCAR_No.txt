            I had been thinking about buying the new Jag X-type for a couple of months.  I noticed that Hertz rented them at the Los Angeles airport as part of their Prestige Collection, so I decided to rent one on my next trip there, which I just returned from.  I was really hoping that I would fall in love with the car and &#147just have to have one&#148 but that didn&#146t happen.  I think it&#146s a nice car, but it simply isn&#146t a good value at $40,000.

The car does have a starting price of just under $30K, but it doesn&#146t come with automatic transmission or metallic paint, so you&#146d have to tack on another couple of thousand just to get those two things.  I would be happy with just those two options, since the car comes with all the equipment that I would need.  The one I rented from Hertz was a 2003 with the sunroof, larger 3.0 engine, automatic trans, CD player, power passenger seat, etc.  I estimate that it cost close to $40,000.

As mentioned in other reviews, this car is based on the same chassis as the Ford Contour, which was discontinued in the USA many years ago.  The Contour was not a bad car, but it never did catch on with the buying public.  It was too small to be a midsize, and too big to be a subcompact. A nicely equipped Contour could be had for around $15,000.    So&#133 did Ford-owned Jaguar add enough equipment to this car to mark up the price $25,000?  I vote no.  

One of the cars I own is a 3-year-old Ford Focus hatchback, which is a great car.  The Focus has less power than the Jag, but it handles better and rides nicer.  The Focus has more interior room front & back, and more headroom.  I know that someone considering a Jaguar will almost certainly not be considering the Focus, but I&#146m just pointing out these things because the Jag seems overpriced to me for what it contains & what it delivers.  When the Focus first came out, one of the car magazines said "why would someone spend more money for a Contour when the Focus is a roomier, better car?"  Why indeed.

The Jag designers used lots of horizontal lines in the design of the sheetmetal, which makes it look longer than it actually is.  Look at the specs -- it's actually 6 inches shorter than a Toyota Camry.

High points:
The interior is very nice.  My car had the champagne color leather interior.  The material seemed to be thick & durable.  The back support in the driver&#146s seat was very nice.  I would have liked to have sunk down into the seat a little more; it almost seemed as if I were perched up a little high.  I am 6 feet tall, and I moved the seat back as far as it would go & then down as far as it would go.  I don&#146t think someone taller than I would be comfortable in this car.  The exterior is beautiful.  If the Contour had looked like this, it would have sold much better.  The car looks nice from the front, side and back.  What a great design on a small car.  The 3.0 engine had lots of power.  I probably would have been just as happy with the 2.5.

Low points:
The automatic transmission didn&#146t shift smoothly; it seemed to surge & pull back.  It might be working properly, but I didn&#146t care for it. The car doesn&#146t have retained accessory power, so you have to turn the switch on to operate the power windows & other accessories after you&#146ve turned off the ignition.  Nearly every luxury car has this feature.  The radio & climate controls were not intuitive at all.  The radio had a search function, but I couldn&#146t find a way for it to scan.  The steering wheel controls had a button that had a plus and a minus, but that button apparently  didn&#146t operate the radio, so I had to keep leaning forward to press the button on the radio to search for other radio stations.  The sun visors are very small & flimsy, and it would have been nice to have a slider extension.  On the freeway, it didn't soak up the expansion strips very well; it felt more like an economy car in this regard.

It's a nice car, but there are lots of nice new cars out there.  It's a high price to pay just to get that "leaping Jaguar" hood ornament. This really is just a Ford Contour with a leather interior & 4 wheel drive.  If you're determined to have a Euro luxury car, be sure to drive the BMW 3 series or Mercedes C Class.  I think you'll be able to tell the difference.
