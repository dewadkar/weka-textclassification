            This was my very first digital camera. Normally I try to stick to either name brands when buying my electronic "toys" and usually do extensive research on items before purchase. But, in this case, the name "SiPix" caught my attention. I found very little information covering reviews, but, found the camera information was more than adequate to base an opinion. 

 Then I was torn between buying the SIPIX SC-2100 (its big brother) or this camera (SIPIX SC-1300). Of course the main differences being in the resolution (2.10 mega-pixels -vs- 1.3 mega-pixels). Everything else was pretty much the same. Then came the price $200 for the SC-2100 or $130 for the SC-1300 (decisions decisions...).

CompUSA was offering a $30 rebate with the purchase of the SC-1300 ($50 with the SC-2100), so I decided to go with the SC-1300 and give it a test run. The pictures are remarkably good. The camera comes with an 8MB CompactFlash card, USB connection, and adequate software. (Photosuite III SE).

I was most impressed with the life of the batteries used. It comes with 4 alkaline batteries, and I've taken over 200 pictures so far, and still have the maximum number of bars for battery life indications (3 bars). You can control whether or not to turn on the LCD screen, the flash, and there is a timer for "auto camera off" user selectable for 2, 5 or 10 minutes.

You can also takes a series of 4 shots right after each other, but, unless you're using a tripod, I've found these pictures to always turn out blurry because of movement. I've never heard of SiPix, but for less than $100 for a digital camera, I think it's well worth the price, and then some.

I found that when I used a multi-voltage adapter for power, it would shut off by itself. The settings used were 6 volts and 7.5. The instructions say 6 to 7 volts, but the side of the camera says 7 volts. I have YET to see the camera operate on its own on electrical power without using batteries. I've tried two different multi-voltage adapters, and the power works good enough to power other electronic devices, but the camera does not stay on long enough for use. Will address this problem with where I bought it, maybe they can shed more light on the topic, after all, I'm still inside my 14 day window.
