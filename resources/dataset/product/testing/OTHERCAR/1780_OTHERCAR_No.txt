            While Chrysler seems to be way out in front of the pack in styling with it's Sebring, reliability wise this car is HORRIBLE.

I bought my '97 JXi in the summer of '99 with about 6K miles. About 3 months after the 3yr/36K mile warranty expired, I began to have multiple problems with a car that had about 15K miles. The starter failed twice, the power windows quite working, and it's been back for repairs on the air conditioning FOUR times and it still doesn't work right in the last 8 months. To add insult to injury, it now looks like the paint is delaminating as well.

As of this writing (2/24/01), I've got it up on the chopping block (still has less then 21K miles) as in the 20 months I've owned the car it's been in the shop TEN times (4x for a/c, 2x for starter, 2x windows & 2x for windshield wipers) and cost me about $1800 in "out of warranty" repairs.

I recommend this car only to those who can afford the high repair bills as well as the payments on a 2nd vehicle while this one is in the shop and certainly don't recommend owning one where the factory or extended warranty has expired.

As a side note, the service provided by the 3 Chrysler dealerships (2 in CA, 1 in SC) who've worked on this car was mediocre at best. I also contacted Chrysler to complain about the quality and they said that was between me and the dealers.
