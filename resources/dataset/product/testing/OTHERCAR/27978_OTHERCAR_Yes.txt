            I purchased my 1998 Tacoma SR5 in August 1998.  I chose the Tacoma because I could not afford a chevy.  In the last sixteen months I have logged 51118 miles without any repairs with the exception of regular services (oil and filter changes and chassis lubrication).  I drive 128 miles per day to work and home.  Having a bad back is a major concern however my SR5 never gives me a back ache.  There is nothing I hate about my truck but my mechanic is always complaining that it never breaks down.  If you put a lot of highway miles on a vehicle and want a pickup truck The SR5 is Ideal and when I hit a patch of ice in the winter time I simply yank the 4WD lever into 4 wheel high and keep going (usually between 50 and 75 miles per hour).<br><br>
