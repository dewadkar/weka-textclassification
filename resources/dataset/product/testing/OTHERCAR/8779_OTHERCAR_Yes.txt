            For several years now, everyone from news portals, to traditional media, to technology pundits have been predicting the up and coming of a convergence of technology. In 1997, people were saying that by 2001, we would be utilizing the Internet on our televisions, high definition television would have a strong following, and we would have a full array of advanced communications tools in the palm of our hands.

Here it is, 2001, and none of these things have happened. Internet usage is still 99% dedicated to the computer, with cell-phones for stock quotes coming in second. Television surfing has achieved very little hold, and broadcasters are saying that they hope to extend the deadline for adoption of high definition television signals well into later this decade, possibly into the next.

But gadgetry, on the other hand, is well on its way to meeting convergence. Some things are meant to be together, such as a cell phone and an MP3 player. Or a Personal Digital Assistant, Cell Phone, and MP3 player. Eastman Kodak thinks they have a perfect convergence combination, and they might just have a good match here.

Kodak would like you to meet "mc3." And I recently got a chance to meet mc3 for myself. And mc3 is a wonderful entertainment device. It's a great example of how synergies in convergence can truly be achieved.

So what is mc3? mc3 consists of a camera, video camera, and mp3 player. Yes, at first it seems like an odd combination, but after using it, you'll realize how genius it is to combine the three things into one unit.

First selection is camera. And while there are better cameras on the market, this one is pint-sized, easy to handle, and good for web pictures and sharing images in e-mail. The images aren't absolutely fantastic, but when you consider the functions included, it is a good trade off. (Pictures are taken at 640x480 resolution.)

The second selection, and possibly the coolest of all of them, is the video portion. By simply selecting this, I can record a video clip with sound. It's not a digital camcorder, so don't expect to become an independent film sensation with it. But for something designed to be inexpensive, it produces good results. And the movies you take are in Quicktime format, so if you have Quicktime Pro from Apple, you are ready to start editing quickly and easily. 

And the third is a digital music player utilizing the MP3 format. The MP3 format is the most popular music format on the Internet, and has stirred controversy from MP3.com to Napster. But it is perfectly legal to use your own music files, and this is where the mc3 is great, letting you take your music with you in a completely skip free device that is not only small, but will allow you to take pictures on the go.

The mc3 utilizes CompactFlash memory, which is a standard memory card. And Kodak sells it for between $199 to $299 depending on the package you choose.

The one drawback is the software is comes with, which is confusing and dreadfully hard to navigate. It is a learning curve to figure out where the files are going. I have an external compactflash reader, and you can actually just insert your compactflash card into the reader and copy the files directly to your own directory if you want, bypassing the Kodak software. You can get one for 20-30 dollars, and they are a very nice addition if you do a lot of connecting and reconnecting.

I think it might also be easier if you get the dock, which allows you to simply place the camera in one place and allow it to connect to your computer through there.

As a first to market device, while it is not perfect, it does its functions fantastically for the level of technology and price point. And since the device is upgradeable, it will be easy to update without buying a new device. I also noted that the lens was a very standard style lens which most likely provides possibility for the lens itself to be upgraded. Overall, a wonderful device, and a must buy for any gadget lover.
