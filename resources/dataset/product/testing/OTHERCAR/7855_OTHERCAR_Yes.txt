            Well, where can we start other than by saying AMAZING!!!
This is the 2nd one I own.  The BMW 330ci has met all my expectation, with some minor exceptions.  I must say amongst all, performance has to be the top rated feature on this car.  This is the most sturdiest driving experience anyone can ever have at this price.  

BMW has come a long way in many years.  Starting by its looks; most impressive in newer models.  Interior designs and of course, the amount of options and features.  Though, there are some things that can be improved.  For Example, at $40,000, you might expect a better sounding sterio system, better leather grades, and in some cases, stronger built interior.  Ratleing on occasion happens from the rear mounted panels and armrests.  Also, the annoying hassle of remembering to manually turn on the fog lights everytime you start the vehicle.  Interior rear view mirror looks like a clowns face with its big red flasher supposedly used for the alarm system which the factory doesn't install anyway.

Engine power is not really as strong as anticipated, even for the 330ci.  It lacks kick in some areas.  Suspension is stiff, but then again, it is a sports car so I guess that is fine.  Maybe lowering the car a bit more could help handeling issue on turns and curves.  

Aside from these minor issues, the car is a great thrill to drive.  And the overall feel is incredible.  Of course, these are just my opinions and everyone's will be different.  Trust me, if you are looking for a vehicle to handle it all, this is the one choice you can't pass
