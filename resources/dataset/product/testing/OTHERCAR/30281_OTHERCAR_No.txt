            As I promised in my Epinion of the JamC@m (which you are hereby invited to read and compare), here is my write-up of the Agfa ePhoto Smile.

My Epinion of the JamC@m can be found at:
<a href='/elec-review-57AC-250E814-38528FDF-bd4'>http://www.epinions.com/elec-review-57AC-250E814-38528FDF-bd4</a>

In the interest of full disclosure, however, I must admit that I never purchased, used, or viewed photos from the &quot;Smile&quot;. Here's why:

I went into a camera store just before Christmas to check out the Smile. I took one off the shelf and read the store's sales catalog entry. My first and most lasting impression is that it &quot;feels&quot; like a junky toy! It has no apparent mass or feeling of substance. I just couldn't bring myself to spend $99.99 ($129.99 - $30 rebate) on this camera. The JamC@m, at least, felt like I was holding something in my hand.

I have also read the other Epinions about the Smile. Seems quite a few of us would rather wait or spring for more money in order to get digital photo capability.

Now, the good news: the Smile has a flash. The Smile has a larger photo capacity than the JamC@m. Apparently, according to another reviewer, you can view your photos on a TV set -- a nice plus.

More bad news: the Smile has no usb connector. I prefer usb to serial for ease of connecting to my computer.

If you are seriously considering purchasing a Smile, I recommend that you *IGNORE* this review for the disclosure stated above, namely that I have no experience with photos taken with it. What you should do is read the Epinions of all the people who have actual photographic experience with it.

Otherwise, all of us budget-minded digital photographers are going to have to wait for prices of &quot;real&quot; cameras to come down.

My fully-disclosed advice is to pass on the Agfa ePhoto Smile.<br><br>
