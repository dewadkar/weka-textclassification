            My passion is cars.  When I saw this car in the magizine I had to have one.  There is one word that describes this car, AWESOME!!  Driving the car is a big rush.  There is no doubt that you can drive it hard and fast, then drive around town mildly, as long as someone dosen't run into you.  It draws so much attention because of its uniqueness.  We live in Chicago, and baught the car in South Carolina.  My wife and I drove it home through the mountains for 2 days.  Going 80 plus mph through the winding curves was incredable.  The comfort on long drives and short is tight and comfortable.  If you can get your hand on one of the 650 in the U.S.A. I highly advise that.  I compared the 911, Boxter, Audi TT, Corvette and nothing compares to the feel of this car.  My father has a 99 Jaguar XK8 and he says that the comfort and feel of my MCoupe is far better. Thank you for reading and remember that this car is for purists!!<br><br>
