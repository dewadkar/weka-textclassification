            I really like my neon. I don't love it adoringly, but appreciate it for what it is. It is a great car for the price. It zips around quickly. I can zoom in and out of traffic when I am running late and it handles well. Is it a Mustang? No. Is it a Jaguar? No. So don't expect it to be what it is not. It is an inexpensive car that doesn't look or feel that inexpensive.

When I bought it the crabby people at work started in immediately. &quot;It will be in the shop all the time&quot; (The guy who said this had to have major work done on his 98 Grand Am twice in three months.)&quot;My old Geo is safer, i heard it on Dateline.&quot; I heard a lot of variations on those themes. I have had no problems with it in almost a year. It still drives as well as it did the first day. I expect that if I am in a major car accident that it won't matter what kind of car I'm in. Let me drive my Neon and keep your copy of consumer reports to yourself.

What do I like about it? We've discussed speed and handling. The trunk is a nice size. I like the fold down back seats. The heat kicks it out here in Freezing Detroit. I like the C.D. player and sound system it sounds great for a factory system. I find it spacious for a small car. The seats are comfortable. It is somewhat attractive looking.

What don't I like? The cup holders under the ashtray area. You can only fit a small beverage in there. I don't know of anyone under the age of 50 who drinks small size drinks. You can fit a sissy little can in there. You can squeeze a 16oz. soda in. Grande Starbucks? Yes, but you are going to burn your hands and endanger your life trying to wrestle it out of there. Big Gulp, forget about it, it has to go between your legs where it can spill on your pants. It is a petty complaint, but I complain best about petty things.

Who should buy this car? Anyone who is looking to not spend a lot of money but still get something fairly nice. Who shouldn't? People who drive Grand Am's, because there is just something different about those people. Something strange.<br><br>
