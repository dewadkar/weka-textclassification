            Let's blow something out of the water right away, right now.  While it has its tremendous psychological advantages to we selfish humans (hey it's natural, don't worry!), a new car is perhaps the worst investment to make in your life.  Heheh.  :)

Nonetheless!  New car for new car, the 2000 Acura TL is certainly a strong contender for &quot;best damn car for the money&quot;.  

I think it looks great, ESPECIALLY from the back.  I love the design treatment there.  Inside, it's very attractive, and spacious.  The colors used for the dash and gauge needles I really like to, and they are like the new Lexus GS-series (tach/speedo/gas-temp gauges are their own &quot;holes&quot; in the dash, pretty good for when you don't want your date/friend to see how fast your're going!).  It's quite spacious, certainly.  

Features?  You people know it comes with everything but memory seats and an option of a 5spd manual tranny.  The Navigation system is excellent, better than the Lexus one and the BMW that I have tried.  Also for 2000 it is DVD player now, which means all 48 states on one CD, faster access, and more detail.  

Side-airbags are now available (std. feature) in the TL (unlike '99).  So is the 5-spd auto version of the sportshift tranny (99 it was 4 spd).  Also, they put in a new intake manifold (err, that's the last thing the air coming into the cylinders passes through, and they made it free-er (sp?) flowing and/or wider diameter).  It is noticably quicker off the line than the '99.  Not bad AT ALL acceleration for a 3500 lb. auto-equipped vehicle.  The torque was spread out marginally more in '00 too (for example peak torque now occurs at 4700 instead of 5k RPMs).

The engine is a gem (like most Honda engines).  The VTEC again, is seemless in its transition from primary to secondary camshaft profiles (why does everyone say it's like a turbo kicking in at XXX RPM?  I always felt it quite smooth in transmission, even in the NSX!).  Ok, speaking of, the exhaust note is awesome.  It's kinda close to the NSX, believe it or not!  Definitely the best-sounding Honda/Acura sedan.  

Solidity rivals many many luxury cars.  Of course, let's not forget reality here.  It's not AS good as a 5-series BMW or a C-class Benz (but I'd say as good as if not better than the new VW passat).  

The BOSE stereo has received mixed reviews.  It sounded very good to my ears, albeit not with the fidelity I'm used to in great BOSE or Infinity Products (then again, it's only 150W, 5 speaker total).  Do yourself a favor: Set the fade balance a little bit in favor of the rear (like twist the dial to maybe the 2 o'clock position rather than 12 o'clock, that way you'll get more usage out of the nD Woofer back there as well as its separate amplifier featuring 100W).  

The traction control didn't work as fast as I would like, but good it's there at least!  And you can switch it off.  The xenon lights are great, as usual.  More cars will follow suit, and rightfully so.

Handling ain't bad, considering the stock rubber.  Get yourself some new rims and tires from the beginning (although those stock rims do look quite sexy, to be honest).  It makes a HUGE difference for this car, as the suspension is fabulous and so is the chassis.  The weak link are those Michelin Energies.  Lotsa people also seem to have done the Comptech lowering Springs modification.  Yeah, that's not catered to most of the TL buyers out there, I know, but should keep in mind anyhow if you're enthusiastic about this stuff.

What's great is you can get cassette, CD, and Navi system, all in-dash at the same time!  Unlike some others...way to go Honda (oops, I mean Acura).

The trunk is huge.  Good stuff.  Rear seats don't fold though, just ski pass in the back.

Fuel economy with the new 5spd is really good too.  Quite an achievment.  29MPG on the highway I think it is.  Nice (relative to weight, class, engine output, etc.).

Now, it is a great value, for sure, but I would probably go for the 323i BMW.  Sure, trunk is smaller, interior is smaller, costs more, etc. but it's not as involving to drive.  It's pretty damn good, but still.  You know what I mean if you drive both cars back to back.  And the BMW would be just $3k or $4k more.  Consider that while Acuras hold their value well, BMWs do so amazingly well (at least in North America).

So to end, I will say a weird thing:  I should say &quot;try before you buy!&quot; but I'll say this:  You wouldn't have to. It will match your expectations for power, comfort, quality, features, value, etc.  So actually &quot;try the competition before you buy!&quot;.  The competition is not as roomy, and if it is we're talking about a higher price bracket here.  However, if driver's involvment is you thing, and YOU WANT 4 DOORS NO ?'s ASKED, then try out the German flavors.<br><br>
