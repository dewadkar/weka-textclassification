            I have a 1996 RAV4 that I got new.  I was the first person in our area to get one.  I'm petite, 5'4&quot;, and this vehicle appealed to me because it's not one of those bulky, clunky SUVs that you need a step stool or a boost to get in to.  It is easy to get in and out of the RAV4.  The seats are nice, fitted, and don't swallow you up.  The visibility in the RAV4 is great.  After driving a low to the ground Jetta for a couple years I appreciated the advantage of being able to see up and around awkward corners.  I now have 80,000 miles on my RAV4.  Obviously, I drive much.  I just replaced the battery for the first time.  I've also replaced brakes.  Beyond that my RAV4 hasn't presented many problems.  However, I don't like where the cup holder is, in the middle of the two front seats, it's a pain to locate while your driving.  I also would like a place to put coins and more places to stash things.  I use the ashtray for coins now.  Also, the air conditioning controls are a bit stiff and not as easy to slide as I would like.  On the plus side, the back seats fold down and up, and the extra space in the back has come in handy to lug yard debris and other stuff.  It's a cute vehicle and has been reliable.  It's going to be tough to pick my next car or truck after having the RAV4.  If your a woman and you want something fun, and to be in control when you drive, this may be the vehicle for you.  Who knows maybe I'll get a RAV4 again.<br><br>
