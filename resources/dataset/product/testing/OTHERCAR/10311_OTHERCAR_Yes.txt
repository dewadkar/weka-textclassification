            My wife and I bought a used Nissan Altima about 2 years ago and have never regretted it one bit.  We decided on the Altima because of it's reputation and economical price.  The price was definitely in our price range and the standard options were everything we had asked for.  We typically get very good gas mileage (average around 30 miles per gallon).  The seats in the car are very comfortable, even on long trips.  The only downfall of the Altima is the size of the back seat.  I wouldn't recommend this car to a family with two older children.  The back seat is not the largest in its class and can be cramped on longer trips.  This is a great car for a newly married couple or single college students who are on a tight budget.<br><br>
