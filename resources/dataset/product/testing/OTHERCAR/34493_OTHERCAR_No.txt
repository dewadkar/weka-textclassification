            When the new front wheel drive Park Avenue was launched in the early nineties, I was instantly hooked on it by it's looks. More so, after I drove one in 1993 on a vacation to the U.S.A. for four thousand miles in quietness and comfort without any trouble, I definately wanted to have one. A year later I found a very nice 1993 model in burgundy with tan leather at my local GM dealership. I fell in love instantly, my wife looked at it and said 'go for it' despite the car was a little over the maximum I could afford. So I parted with my trusted 300,000 trouble-free mile 78 Caprice and bought it. 

It turned out to be the biggest mistake in my life.

At that time I had a travelling occupation and had to drive ca. 50,000 miles a year, mainly on the European interstate system. The first drawback occurred on the first trip through Germany, when I noticed, that the top speed was restricted to exactly 112,5 mph. I immediately complained to my dealer and insisted on a new prom for the ECM without that limitation, but was told that it is not available. Subsequently, I had to drive the car at full throttle all the time, something I really dislike.
OK, you will say, why does this lead-foot just not drive slower?

Well, I started to adapt my driving habits to my new car, something I wouldn't even have thought about while driving my venerable Caprice. Trip averages with the Buick became up to 20% slower then they were with the Chevy, but guess what? Fuel consumption was higher!
Another most annoying thing was, that the shifting points of the transmission were so mismatched to the engine's torque curve, that I constantly had to shift forth and back, which was answered by a looong delayed response with a considerable cant each time.

I was really incontent and unhappy with the car but I had to stick to it, because nobody wanted to buy it. After six months I offered the car at half the price I paid for it, just to get rid of it, but -no deal. So I soldiered on, going through six alternators ($150 ea) in one year, replacing the front tires after every 15000 miles ($100 every time), having half of the engine rebuilt after a sensor for the crankshaft position fell off inside the motor (they glue that stuff on, you know),
had constant trouble with the fuel metering for the injection system because that sensor has a life span of about three weeks and don't ask me what else little but annoying thingys went wrong as well. It turned out that there would be no long distance trip without a visit to the garage afterwards.

I wrote several letters of complaint to GM, but they always claimed that cars sold in Europe are not covered under their warranty system. Remember: this was an export version made for the EEC market sold by an official GM dealership, not a grey import.

The absolute incident happened one night after the car was parked in my driveway for over an hour after a little shopping trip: It self-ignited and burned into the ground while I desperately waited for the fire brigade to arrive. Not to mention the embarrassment in front of my neighbors!

I had an expert estimate the value of the car in order to get some compensation (the car was NOT insured for fire!). I asked him what the reason for the fire could be and he told me it clearly originated in the engine compartment, most probably by fuel vapor, emitting from a leaking fuel pipe. He says this is not an unusual sight for him since GM builds it's fuel injection system in a way that it doesn't loose it's fuel pressure for a long while after you switched off your car. Unthinkable practice for manufactures of what you call imports, for obvious reasons.
You can guess what GM had to say to the whole affair.

My verdict about the Park Avenue: Please, somebody, give me a 78 Caprice!<br><br>
