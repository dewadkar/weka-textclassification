            I drove to the Toyota dealer in my girlfriend's 2000 LE V6, mainly to see how much the new car is improved over the old one.  With the new platform, I expected great things from the new Camry.  Looking the car over and seeing the new details, I was very impressed.  However, when I drove the car, I was a bit disappointed.

The new Camry looks much better in my opinion.  It looks like what I would expect from Lexus.  In fact, the new ES 300 is hardly changed from the new Camry, unlike the older versions.  The rear end doesn't look as nice as the front though.  It just doesn't flow as well as the rest of the car.  Try to get the SE, just for the foglights.  They make the car look far better than without.  Without them, the front fascia looks a bit unfinished and maybe even a little cheap.

Inside, I was very impressed.  The car is significantly larger in all areas.  The dash has a more modern design and all the controls fall easily to hand and are simple to use and understand.  There's even a chrome Toyota symbol on the steering wheel which lends a touch more class than simply embossing the logo into the plastic.  The gauges take some getting used to.  I prefer simple round dials with the gas and temp gauges separate.  The new Camry has the gas and temp gauges set into the tach and speedometer, although the needle won't block the view of gas unless you travel above 100 mph.  

All seating areas feel much larger.  Sitting 5 people won't cause as many complaints as before.  There will be no complaints if you only carry 4.  The trunk is visibly larger.  There is a little storage area that goes down into the spare tire area (space previously wasted).  The hinges on the trunk are even designed to not protrude into the storage area, so you don't need to position your luggage to avoid the hinges anymore.  There are now map pockets in the rear doors as well as pockets in the backs of the front seats.  The center console area is huge now.  It's two layers and large enough to fit a Kleenex box.  There's even an extra power plug in there.

The problems began when I took the car out for a test drive.  The salesman encouraged me to test the limits of the car, so I obliged.  Camry V6's have never been fast, but they have been smooth and felt powerful.  This one was rougher and I didn't feel like I was being pulled.  The sensation was more like driving a Honda 4 cylinder rather than a Toyota V6.  The brakes didn't engage as smoothly either.  Worse, the ride wasn't as smooth and quiet either.  I did feel the road better and it doesn't handle like a boat anymore, but no one buys a Camry for performance.  My dad's 2000 Accord still handles better, but the Camry doesn't have as nice a ride to counter anymore.  It still is really quiet and smooth, just not to the degree the 2000 Camry is.  A Civic, Corolla, or practically all domestics still sound like tin cans compared to the Camry though.  Don't believe me, test drive a Camry and Malibu back to back and you'll wonder why the General bothers making cars at all.

I test drove the car with the perspective of a typical Camry buyer: conservative, looking at value and a little bit of luxury and performance.  I know it's not a sports car and I didn't thrash it like one.  I took some hard turns, but I've also been through a 90 degree turn going 70 mph in a Supra Turbo.  Camry drivers don't expect that, just driving to work or school in a hurry on occasion.  The tires on the LE are the all season tires.  Those looking for a bit more performance can choose the SE which comes with summer tires.  Toyota also gives you the option of taking the all season tires on the SE.  The all season tires perform fine for normal driving and they provide more safety if your climate gets inclement weather.

While I was a bit disappointed with the driving dynamics of the new Camry, this is still an overwhelming recommendation.  Toyota kept the prices largely untouched.  For the same amount of money, you get a much larger car that looks far more luxurious.  The little details such as the increased storage area inside the car makes a big difference.  Map pockets and map lights may not sound like a big deal, but they make going on trips with friends and family a lot more tolerable.  Toyota's attention to the details is what makes this car so great.  It's hands down the best family car out in the market right now.  We'll see if Honda's new 2003 Accord can reach the bar the Camry has set.
