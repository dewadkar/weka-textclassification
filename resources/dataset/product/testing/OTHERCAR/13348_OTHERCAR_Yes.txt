            The quality of this camera is superb. I have had the opportunity of sampling many mid-priced cameras. Between the Fujis, Minoltas, Nikons, and others, I feel the MX series Fuji digital cameras pull ahead of all others. The square format pixle is really what gives Fuji cameras a spunk no other can compare to. Because Fuji has incorporated the  square pixle format into its camera, the quality of the picture is sharp, especially when changing the document size in the post picture taking stage.

The only feature I prefer in a digital camera that the MX series lacks is a zoom lense or a longer zoom.

Any beginning or intermediate photographer would find this particular series useful.<br><br>
