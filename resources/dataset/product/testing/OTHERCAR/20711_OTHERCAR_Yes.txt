            The only car I considered for a college commuter. Eclipses are cool, but are built worse that GM cars. How manyEclipses from the early 1990's do you still see on the road? How many Integras from '87 to present? Secondgeneration Integras are still out there are looking great. I get great mileage from my 1999. The ride is comfortable, a good compromise between comfort and performance (hey, I out ran a Camaro SS in the mountains). Wet weathertraction is another issue. The stock tires are horrible in the rain and I have been tempted to do what every otherIntegra has done: put Falken 205/50 15 on the stock wheels. Those are great tires that improve handling, and mostof all, improve wet weather traction. If you want a coupe, defenitely check the Integra out, both LS and GSR. I lovemine! Just add a Bazooka tube subwoofer to have a great sounding stereo.                                                                           
If you try to compare an Integra to a Mustang or Camaro, you are comparing 2 different breeds of cats. Integras are for those who love efficiency and doesn't want to be a copycat (my grandpa drove a camaro). If my Integra enginewas as big as a Camaro's, it would make 430 horsepower! Integra's are well designed and utilize technology.
                                                             If you want to buy an Integra, check out Kelly's Blue Book (www.kbb.com) to find the invoice price. Offer about $400above that and you will be pretty much guaranteed a deal. Just take a close look at all Integras (LS, GS, GSR) andtest drive them all before you buy!<br><br>
