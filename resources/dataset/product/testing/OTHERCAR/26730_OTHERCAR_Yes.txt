            I have used the following cameras so this is what i am comparing the 360L to:<br><br>Largen Lmini<br>RCA CDS 1000<br>Kodac DC 215<br>Mavica(expensive on w/ movie capture)<br><br>I started out trying to find the best camera for my money and at first thought that i could get by with a cheaper ( under $150) camera.  However, i found that both the Rca and Largen cameras really are worth <br>what you pay for them.  I am also doing reviews for those products so check them out there.  <br>The olympus 360L is an awesome camera, it handles low light night shots awesome, it takes clean clear pictures, and can hold lots of them on its <br>included 8mb card.<br>The 1.8' TFT display is very clear also much more so than on the Kodac DC 215, which i used just the day before.  I took it back and got the Olympus because of the many features on the olympus that the kodac didn't have. Such as... a ISO setting, detailed lighting selection, and <br>an autofocus, while the Kodac is focus-free and doesn't have any delay between button-press and taking the picture, the olympus has a 2 sec delay, but i think takes slightly cleaner pictures because of it.  Also another important feature was the recycle time, the olympus is about 4 sec, the kodac still about 10, the olympus can also burst mode , which means capturing 10pics at a rate of 2 per sec. Very nice!!!<br>Great product<br><br><br>
