            I bought the car new in 1992.  I read numerous articles that praised the performance of the car.  I just love the way the car looks.  After 8 years, I still enjoy walking up to my fwd black turbo and admiring the design.  The car is fast, although there is some turbo lag.  Because of the turbo, this car performs very well at high altitudes.  I notice very little power loss as the turbo simply spins faster to make up for the lower pressure.  The car has always handled great in dry conditions.  It can get a little unstable on wet pavement though.  

The interior space is snug and I would not wish the back seat on anyone.  With folding rear seats and a hatch, I have been able to haul an amazing amount of stuff.  (Camping gear, lumber, bags of cement, plants, groceries, and furniture...) 

This car has been surprisingly reliable.  I have just passed 100,000 miles
and I have had no major problems.  Timing belt and water pump was replaced at the normal 60,000 interval.  I still have the original brakes and clutch.  The rotors needed machining for the 1st time about 12,000 miles ago which solved my brake shuddering problem.  The air conditioning failed about 2 years ago, which was disappointing.  I am getting some oil leakage around the valve covers, which is probably normal for a car with this many miles.  With respect to the exterior, the paint around the mirrors has become very faded.

Now for the downside.  I need to replace the car with a larger car to accommodate our first child due in Oct.  Itï¿½s been a real kick owning this car and I'm really going to miss it.
