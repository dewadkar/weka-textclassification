            The nissan sentra is a great car. I currently own a sentra and I love the way it has held up. It has good features, and hasn't had any problems. It starts every time and has a pretty smooth ride for a low end car. It also has a good stereo with a tape deck and radio. Other important features include, heat, ac, power windows, power locks, dual airbags, and more. With all of these features you would think the sentra would be more expensive then it is.....but I leased it for only 99 dollars a month!!! It is an unbelievable bargain!!! It handles well, looks good, and its safe. It gets great gas mileage and its inexpensive! The only bad thing is that sitting in the back is very tight because there isnt a lot of room back there. Besides that it is a comfortable car. All in all the sentra is a great car and i recommend it to anyone who wants a good bargain, and a good sturdy dependable car.<br><br>
