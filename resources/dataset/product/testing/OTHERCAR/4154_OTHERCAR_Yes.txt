            I received my Rodeo about two years ago (Jun 99). Before then I had owned several different cars. Buick, Hyundai and Dodge just to mention a few. Some were four cylinder and one was a V-6. I must admit once I had that V-6 engine, I was not about to turn back. However, when I got into, what was soon to be mine, Red Rodeo (just like the song says), I was in heaven. I was no longer low enough to the ground that when a truck pulled up behind me I was being blinded with his lights nor could anyone look 'down' at me. It was in a word: perfection. 
My Rodeo is loaded to the max. I have cruise, a/c, tinted windows, PL, PW, alarm system, roof rack, brush guard, side steps, 6 CD disk changer, auto and of course, it's a V-6. I got all of this for under $15,000. It is a beautiful red color with plush tan interior. It is roomy. I have taken my family of four to the drive-in theater, backed up and we all laid in the back with seat down and watched the movie. We were comfortable and cozy. The truck (my baby, as I call it) has taken us on several vacations. I have a five and a six year old. Both were able to stretch out and sleep and they still had room for all their toys and snacks. 
I admit I am biased about my truck. My husband and I talk frequently about when it will be time to trade it in for a newer model and I actually weep. I love this truck. It has all the power and comfort a modern mother needs. I highly recommend it to any mother in need of something that has the following: Everything.
