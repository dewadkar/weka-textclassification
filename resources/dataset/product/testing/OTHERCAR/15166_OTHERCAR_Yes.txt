            I have been waiting for two years for quality to improve and prices to go down on digital cameras.  Finally, I decided to purchase one for my husband and myself for Christmas.  After a great deal of research I settled on the Toshiba PDR-M60.  It was a great price for a 2.3 MegaPixel camera - $399, and the Toshiba reputation for quality products sealed the deal.
We used the camera for the first time on Christmas morning - and the resulting photos - with no learning curve and about 2 minutes spent reading the manual - were fantastic!!  It is just as easy to use as any of the self focusing 35mm cameras we have used in the past.  We haven't played with any of the manual settings yet - so far the automatic mode has worked well for us.
The only suggestion that I would make for a potential buyer is to invest in a larger memory card - I purchased a 64mb smart card that allows me to take over 60 pictures at the highest quality and least compression; and high quality rechargeable batteries and a battery charger.
The PDR-M60 doesn't come with many accessories, but at this price I wasn't expecting any - and I will add the accessories as I can afford them.  I highly recommend this camera!<br><br>
