            My wife and I bought a 2000 Olds Alero and we love it!!!  After driving cross country in it we can't get enough of the awesome power and tight handling.  Talk about luxury for the price, I don't think you can beat it. Just try to keep it under a hundred when you hit the interstate. I still love every minute of this true driving experience. If you are in to stereos the speakers are great and the tape and CD player are easily accessible. I just don't think that I can say enough. The only thing that I will say is if you aren't looking for a car that handles great, looks smooth and gives you an all around good feeling when you drive it then this isn't the car for you.<br><br>
