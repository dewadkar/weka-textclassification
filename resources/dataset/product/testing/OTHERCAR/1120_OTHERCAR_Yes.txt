            I bought a brand new 2000 Dodge Neon with the expectations of an economy car that wouldn't have mechanical problems, would have solid gas mileage, and would still look good for the next several years.  I have not been disappointed.

Appearance:  B+  It is sleek, aerodynamic, and attractive.  The color options are nice, but not as plentiful as I personally would like.  So far the outside as held up well, and the interior seems to remain clean.  Neons aren't the most beautiful car in the world, but they are certainly a step above considering they are economy cars.

Comfort:  B  The contour seats are comfortable for the back.  However, a lombar isn't available in my model.  The things you come in contact with such as the steering wheel, the gear shift, and the door handles and buttons are nice to the touch.  The back seats are adequate in comfort, but the head rests don't help if you are taller then about 5'10&quot;.    

Handling and Speed:  B  The speed isn't there.  Then again you aren't buying a Porsche.  It isn't slow by any means and has grit when going up hills.  The ride is nice unless you hit a road inundated with cracks.  You will feel each bump in the road unfortunately.  It does take corners pretty well.

Size:  A-  The slanted front windshield gives you a nice feeling of space.  Plenty of arm room and legroom for a midsize sedan particularly in the front seat.  The back seat has lots of elbow room, and the legroom depends (like most midsize cars) on how far the seat in front of you has been pushed back.  Unless you have Charles Barkley in the front seat, you should enjoy the legroom in the back.  The glove compartment and armrest compartment are more then adequate.  Three drink holders in the front are nice along with a little padded sunglass area on the dashboard.

Amenities:  B+  Stereo is decent.  Tape player with good sound but not great speaker quality.  Again, this is an economy car so the sound system is probably better then I expected.  Buying automatic windows or locks probably wouldn't be worth the investment on a Neon, but cruise control would be worth it if you made frequent long distance trips.  

Cost:  A-  Not an A because can we ever really get a car for what we would actually want to pay for it?  No, but the MSRP isn't bad.  The demand isn't great so you can probably bargain quite a bit (I got mine for $100 over invoice).  The gas mileage is good but not as good as the sticker indicates (are they ever as good as what the sticker says?).  The downside to the cost is that the value drops like a lead weight once you drive off the lot.

The bottom line is what do you want?  Do you want an efficient car that should hold up pretty well?  Do you want a car that looks good for the price and has some nice options for the price?  If the answer is yes, the Neon is for you.
