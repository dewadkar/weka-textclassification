            i have to admit, i have not driven many different kinds of cars in my life but i have tested out the Plymouth Acclaim and i am won over.when i was in high school we the Acclaim's were the main cars my drivers ed class used, even though we had a few other cars as well. i have driven about 5 or 6 different cars so far and the acclaim gets the number 1 spot.

this car is luxury.makes you feel like you are driving inside a nice, comfy and cozy little plush room.

but aside from the comfort, it drives GREAT.very smooth steering and easy to control.you barely have to touch the accelerator or brake.the total driving experience is great.

i also like the fact that it isnt too big and isnt too small.<br><br>
