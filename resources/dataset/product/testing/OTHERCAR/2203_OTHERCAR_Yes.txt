            I first went to the local Honda dealership to look at some used cars they had on their lot.  I told the salesman that I was looking for a two door, sporty car.  I knew that Honda made the Prelude in the past but was not aware that the model was still being produced.  He brought me over to the only model they had in stock and let me check it out.  

<b>Engine</b>
The Prelude comes with a I4, 200 hp engine that likes to be driven to the redline.  Similar to the Acura Integra, the Prelude is equipped with the VTEC design, which allows the engine to give off a little more punch.  I chose to use the 5 speed for my test drive which provided tight shifting and allowed better �handling� from the car.  Overall I was very pleased with the way the Prelude drove.  It had very nice acceleration from the moment you stepped on the accelerator.  There was zero hesitation and the car seemed to excel when pushed to the limits.  

The Prelude allows for decent gas mileage.  The quoted sticker amounts were 27 highway and 22 city.  This is not bad considering the power that the I4 will give you behind the wheel.

<b>Handling</b>
The Prelude comes with a four wheel double wishbone suspension which allows the car to handle very well.  During my test drive, I took the car around some pretty sharp corners at decent speeds.  I had no problem controling the car.  In fact, the car seemed to love to accelerate into the corners.  

The steering was tight and easy to control.  At no time during the test drive did I feel as though the car was in control instead of myself.  

<b>Interior</b>
The interior of the Prelude was nice but nothing out of the ordinary.  The console was set up with the basic gauges (i.e. tachometer, speedometer, gas and heat) that were easy to read for both tall and short drivers.  The controls in the center of the car were easy to access while driving and should not pose any safety hazards because you have to fiddle around looking for the button.  Since I test drove the car on a hot day, we did have the air conditioner on and the car cools fast.  The Prelude comes with a 6 speaker, CD receiver that is standard.  The system is loud, but could be better.  I would say the sound is average compared to other cars in its class.  There is plenty of room for two adults in the front seat but space is VERY limited for adults or children in the backseat.  I think even a child would get uncomfortable if the ride was any longer then a half hour.   The model I drove also had a moon roof, which slid back.  This is a nice feature for those summer drives to the beach.

<b>Exterior</b>
The exterior of the Prelude is nice, but does not look as fancy as the Integra or Celica.  When looking at the car, it seems as though the hood is a bit longer on the Prelude then the other two cars mentioned.  For some reason, in my mind this gave the car a little sportier feel.  The car comes with 16� alloy wheels with Bridgestone tires.  The model I drove had a rear spoiler, which also added to the sporty feel of the car.  

<b>Safety</b>
The Prelude comes with no additional safety features that their competition offers.  ABS brakes and dual front airbags come standard with every sale.  The Prelude also comes equipped with a theft deterrent system.  

<b>Reliability</b>
Honda�s have been known for years for their reliability.  The Accords and Civics became so popular in the mid 1990s because they were known to last for years and years after the purchase.  There is no reason to believe that the Prelude will disappoint their customers.  

<b>Price</b>
The Prelude is a bit pricey.  The model I drove was quoted to me at about $25,600.  This price did include some additional features such as the spoiler, gold package, sunroof visor and cassette.  

Overall, I really enjoyed driving this car.  The speed was perfect.  The car handled great and the outside was very sporty.  The price was a little high, but is manageable if you really love the car.
