            Why buy? just couldn't resist. three years ago I almost did, price was over $1000, features dubious compared to print film with my Nikon or Mamiya for comparison. Today the product seems ready.
Reason #1 - Saw a FD-73 in action. My son-in-law had bought one at Walmart. I went to the camera store. They showed me comparisons of resolution between three MVC Sony cameras at same price as WalMart's. The better resolution convinced me to spend $200 more for a FD-83. If you do come up with a terrific shot you will want to enlarge it or get several copies. Get the best for what you need.
Reason #2 - No film, no developing, Wow - what a novelty. It's on a floppy disk. It can be viewed and edited on the computer.
Reason #3 - endless shots available, limited only by room on the disks, and battery life.
Reason #4 - Immediate viewing of shots taken. Like a polaroid or a video camera you can review your shots.
Reason #5 - Other features - such as big viewing screen instead of squinting thru a view finder. Size - like a medium 35mm. Similar things like an ordinary camera like letting yourself get into the picture in a 10 second hold before click. All sorts of settings - regular to moonlight!
