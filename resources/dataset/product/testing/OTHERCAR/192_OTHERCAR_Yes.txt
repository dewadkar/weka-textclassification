            I bought a 95 and 1/2 Rodeo in the fall of 95. I still have this truck today, it has over 100,000 miles on it, and im never had to have it in the shop except for an electrical problem in its early life. Its got a sturdy V6, that is not under powered. I can pull a trailer with it just fine. Its pretty roomy, enough for 5 people to sit comfortably. The road noise in mine is higher than i thought it would be, but it is still decent for its size and shape. If you cn find a 95 thsan has under a 100,000 miles on it, and is still in good shape, jump on it, it should last you another 75,000 miles. Over all i give this one four stars, it could use some improvments on the interior. CUPHOLDERS!<br><br>
