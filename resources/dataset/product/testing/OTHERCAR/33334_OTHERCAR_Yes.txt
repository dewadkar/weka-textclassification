            We had a 1992 Plymouth Voyager, bought it new in 1992, and traded it in 1995 with 120,000 miles on it.  There were several problems with this van.

First of all, we had three transmissions put in it, the first two covered by the warranty, the last we paid for.  They never knew why it went through so many.  Secondly, it was difficult to work on.  My husband does most of the routine maintenance and repairs.  The engine was difficult to access. It also needed a new compressor for the air conditioner, and the radio had to be replaced.

But, there were also some great things.  The built in child seats were wonderful, held up well, and folded away easily.  The rear seat came in and out very easily, unlike the Safari we have now. The seating for 7 was comfortable, and we often had 4 adults and 3 children for a roomy ride. The rear seat was somewhat difficult for an adult to enter, much better suited for kids.  The middle seat was roomy enough for two adults comfortably.

As far as gas consumption, I believe it was fairly normal as compared to other mini-vans, about 20-25 mpg highway.

The interior held up well, but it was a mistake to get the light blue color.  It did get dirty as you would expect of a light color.
We had two sets of brakes installed, again not too bad for 120,000 miles. The tires withstood normal wear and tear, and we replaced them at about 75,000 miles.

The roominess of this van was great.  The rear cargo area was small, but we did not have the grand voyager, which is much bigger.  The rear area was big enough to hold a smaller size cooler, and some luggage.

We live in Ohio, and took this van to Florida 3 times, and pulled a fold down camper.  Even while towing, it rode very smooth.

Overall, I loved this vehicle.  It was big enough to hold everything we needed, but not too big to park.<br><br>
