            Having owned a 1990 Range Rover with few problems, I purchased a 95 Discovery.  It appeared on the surface to include the same engine, drive, train and amenities which made the first vehicle ownership such a joy.

Boy, what a disappointment.  Following is the &quot;litany&quot; of problems: 4 sets of sunroofs replaced; dash board delaminated; water pump leaked; instrument binnacle intermittent; abs failed the first time to the snow;new
engine at 60k mi plus (after complaining of an engine knock upon delivery of the vehicle.)  My best option purchased was an extended warranty.

All of these incidents were unfortunately spaced perfectly to avoid my recourse under the California lemon law.  The experience I had with Range Rover North America was indifferent; stone-walling.  The dealer offered to give me a great trade in on another.  I was not going there.  I sold the vehicle at a great loss to a broker.

I hope that Ford has a better idea.  I purchased a new Mercedes S-class.  They know how to treat a customer.  By the way, it costs less to own and operate than a fully equipped Range Rover Discovery.<br><br>
