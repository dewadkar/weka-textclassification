            The Dodge Neon has a cute look but behind that cute look there are many problems.  I was 18 and my parents were buying me my first car.  We were immediately attracted to the cute look and the price.  I thought it was the ultimate chick mobile.  I soon found out that looks can be very deceiving.
I had bought a 1997 Neon and my nightmare started at about 9,000 miles.  My car would actually accelerate on its own.  At least that is what i like to say.  But it really did.  The engine would race and the car would actually accelerate even if i had my foot on the break.  The car was taken back  to the dealer too many times to count and they tried replacing everything because they didn't know what it was.  To make it worse they tried to make me pay for all of it.  But the car was still under warranty and my dad had to fight with Dodge to make them pay for it.  They replaced just about everything but nothing fixed this car.  I truly believe that it was lemon!  I finally had to get rid of the car because things were getting so bad.  I honestly felt that the car was unsafe to drive!  
The Dodge dealership that we went to was not very helpful at all they didn't go out of their way to help us.  I was never provided with a rental car for any of the times it was at the dealership.  On many occassions it was at the dealership for many days.  I don't feel that the service department or dogde in general handled my case very well.  I have never heard anyone who owns a Neon say anything good about it.  The only good thing about it was that it got good gas mileage.  But the bad things definitely out weighted the good things.
