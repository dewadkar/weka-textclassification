            The Forester is a wonderful cross between a traditional compact station wagon and mini-van/SUV.  It is roomy, with comfortable seats, and importantly has enough headroom to carry bulky objects as well as do away with the claustrophobic feeling in most smaller vehicles.  The AWD traction and ABS braking system make it a wonderful road vehicle as well as useful for surprisingly tough off the road use.  I have the standard stick shift transmission and find it versatile, and easy to shift, with an occasional miss getting it into reverse (probably my ineptitude).  I have driven it both on long trips and around town/countryside and find it comfortable for both.  Entry and exit are great; no need to climb out or tc climb in. <br><br>
