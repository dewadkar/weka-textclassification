            My first good experience with a vehicle. The GMC Sonoma reminded me of the cartoon Mighty Mouse, small but powerful. I enjoyed the vehicles handling, pulling, and comfort. I purchased the vehicle used for probably a little too much money, but was very seldom let down. I did experience some problems with the interior. Plastic components such as A/C vents and the support arm for the glove compartment were very brittle. This was either a product flaw or the cause of a few too many Texas summers. Either way the vehicle was vast improvement over any that I had owned prior to its purchase. I now have a Nissan Van and a Toyota Pickup, but if a friend asked me if the Sonoma was a good vehicle, I'd say YES.<br><br>
