            Fresh out of college, I bought my 1990 Mazda Miata because it represented how I felt at the time: free, young and ready for fun.

I did not know how to drive standard at the time, so learning that was a new experience. Given its sporty nature, I believe most Miatas are standard. However, learning was not hard, and after a month I felt very capable driving. It was empowering having that much control over the car.

What I love about the Miata: it attracts attention. People come up to me and say how cute the car is, which starts a conversation, which is cool. I also love the fact that it is small and intimate, just me and my wheels. It's also great on a nice day to put down the top and have the wind blowing through my hair. Finally, it's very easy to wash and take care of. It is so small that a good wash and vaccuum does not take long at all.

What I don't like: over time, it can be a drag to have that lack of space. The trunk is not big, and I can only have one passenger. People sometimes have trouble getting in and out of the car because it sits so low to the ground. Also, although the car is very reliable, at its age parts and getting old and breaking. I had to replace the top recently, which cost $$$.

Driving the Miata is a fun experience. It makes a sporty buzzing noise and the ride is fairly smooth. Although at its age, reaching speed quickly can be hard, I am able to merge into traffic without any problems. People ask me if I am scared driving such a small car around big trucks, but I am not. Other drivers do try to intimidate me sometimes by tailgating in their massive trucks, but I ignore them and am not bothered over much. I feel safe in the car because I think I am a capable driver, and a lack of size will not change that.

I would recommend this car for people who are looking for a fun, reliable and affordable sports car. I think it is better as a second car, instead of a primary car, due to the lack of size and the wear and tear that will occur. I would not recommend this car to people who get intimidated by larger cars in traffic, or who are constantly shuttling people around in their cars. A two-seater can be difficult when you have a lot of friends who like to socialize; there is always the problem of carpooling to different events.<br><br>
