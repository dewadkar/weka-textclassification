            Almost a year ago I wrote that I had found the car of my dreams. My one last fling at having a sporty-looking car. I had given my heart to the sleek seductive curves of the Monte Carlo, comfort beyond belief, step on the gas on the v-6 and your gone! 

Alas the marriage is over and we have now divorced and gone our separate ways. I'm sure the sleek, dark forest green curves will beckon another to come hither as I saw young and old eyeball my Monte as I left in my new car. But beware of the little things that can go wrong and the year it was made is very critical, this was the year of the great General Motors strike of March of 1996 of the brake division (and yes the brakes were among the problems I had with it) which then idled several other plants and divisions throughout the country and resulted in sloppy work.

<b>But first let me tell what I liked about the car:</b>

<i>* Probably the most comfortable and wide seats I have ever sat on. It was like sitting in your favorite recliner.

* The car hugs the curves and the road since it sits so low to the ground and provides you with a feeling of capability of not being buffeted all over the road.

* The car is heavy. I never once got stuck in the snow. It just plowed through like a tank.

* I got supreme gas mileage for a 6 cylinder - 24 m.p.g in the city and 30 on the highway.

* It has an excellent sound system. You just want to crank it up to feel the music!</i>

<b>Now remember this car is only 4 years old! So the things I don't like about it and why I got rid of it are:</b>

<i>* The paint job was not the best. In fact I remember looking at another one on the lot at the time we bought this one. It had the same spot and paint chips on it as did the one I bought.

* You have to go very slow in and out of steep driveways like I have or it will scrape the front of the car.

* As reported in the other two opinions on this car, I too had a problem with the transmission. I remember traveling the last leg of a 300 mile trip being just 5 miles from home when the all of a sudden the automatic transmission slipped out of gear and down to neutral. I put in first gear and was able to get it home. We had it checked the next day and all the mechanic could say is maybe it got to hot.

* The trunk hinges squeaked! It was embarrassing to pop open the trunk and it sounded like a hinged casket opening. No amount of oiling helped.

* The molding on the inside passenger side upper door trim is coming loose.

* The rubber molding that is around the driver's door to keep the rain out, fell off several times when it was hot outside. How embarrassing to open your car door uptown and to have all the black molding fall on to the street!

* Then 3 weeks ago the rear view mirror fell off the windshield. So I had to spend one afternoon sitting in the car, with arm aching from holding it up reattaching it. 

* The trunk leaks on the left side when it rains.

* My hubby, who has trouble bending at the knees, found it too low to the ground to get in and out of.

* When there is high humidity, the brakes squeak.

* Last but not least, the day before we were to get rid of if, the little button guard that stops the seat belt from retracting fully fell off!</i>

A good friend of mine has a 1998 Monte Carlo and she is starting to have similar problems. I looked up the General Motors site about strikes then...and yep they were on strike then too. She told me was getting rid of hers also. 

Maybe that was the reason they redesigned the car this year. So buyer beware!<br><br>
