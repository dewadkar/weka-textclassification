            The Acura CL is one of the phatest cars that I have ever seen or driven in.  It has one of the coolest looks around and comes with the great service that Acura provides!  It is a fairly large and roomy sedan but at the same time it has that super cool and sporty look to it.  Believe me for all those guys out there you can really pick up some girls with this bad boy.  I have driven this car before at it definitely has some guns to it. Also the car handles extremely well.  This car is loaded with just about everything you can think of.  It is a very comfortable car that you could live in. This is obviously one of the coolest cars and is great for everyone<br><br>
