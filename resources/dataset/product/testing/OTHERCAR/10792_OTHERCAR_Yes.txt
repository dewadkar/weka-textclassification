                  I was convinced on buying the gmc suburban because of its power and ability.What i like about the suburban is it emence power and size . One of the things i noticed is the GMC suburban really isn't what you would call the typical economy car,The GMC suburban gets about 12 miles to the gallon.The suburban handles really well , and it gives you the comfort of safety.i would recomend this SUV to large families or any one with the need to tow large trailers or boats.If you don't have a large family or the need to tow I would recomend the GMC jimmy or the Chevorlet S-10 Blazer.<br><br>
