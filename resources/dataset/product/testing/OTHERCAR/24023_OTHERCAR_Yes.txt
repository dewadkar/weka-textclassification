            I just test drove a new WRX sedan accompanied by a totally wacko car salesman who directed me down a curvy, gravel road to a large, fifty acre, muddy field.  I am an ex desert racer (motorcycle) with quite a lot of off road experience so you can imagine how delighted I was to have a chance to really wring out the WRX Subie in the element it was built for.

The gravel road was the first joy.  The drill went like this: accelerate hard down a straight and the car wags very slightly, digs its toes in and scats--no corrections needed.  Then arriving way too quickly at the curve at the end of the straight--going way too fast, naturally--turn the wheels, and hit the power.  The WRX swings out at a fairly radical angle and you think, "Uh oh."  No problemo.  The all wheel drive and limited slip pulls the car through the turn, straightens it out and zips it down the next straight, leaving you with a big stupid grin on your face ready for to do the same thing again and again.

If that was fun, the muddy field was paradise.  Try doing fifty and throwing the WRX completely sideways in the mud with the power fully on.  You expect to spin donuts for a few revs, but wind up instead sliding sideways for a while, all four tires spinning, until they gain traction and squirt you off in the direction the car is pointed.  Or throw the rear end from side to side again at fifty--again with the power on--and you wriggle across the field like a tadpole with a snake after it.

After a few minutes of this madness, the nut case salesman began, I think, to consider the consequences of his permissiveness and suggested strongly that maybe it was time to return to the dealership.  So we had another good run on the gravel and returned to the car lot with the brand new WRX looking like a pig waddling back from the barn yard after a big rain.  I would have liked to have been a fly on the wall in the sales manager's office during the next thirty minutes.

I think all the nice qualities attributed to the WRX--robust build; good road manners; solid,quick engine; comfortable ride; great value--are correct and justified.  But let me add one more: fantastic rough road and off road handling.  If you buy one of these bargain rockets and just drive it on paved roads, I am sure you'll have a lot of fun, satisfying motoring.  But you will only be enjoying maybe forty percent of the WRX's kick-in-the-pants, outrageous, fun-filled potential.  Tear up some loose dirt and gravel roads.  You can't help but love it and so probably will your dealer when you drive in for parts.
