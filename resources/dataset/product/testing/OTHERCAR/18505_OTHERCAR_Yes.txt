            I have a 2002 Passat GLX.  I purchased it based on the recommendations of friends who own Passat's and other VW models and the reviews I read on this web site.

After 6 months and 8000 miles I would like to share my experiences and some of the tips and tricks I have learned.

I commute 30 minutes via the Interstate to work each day.  So most of my time in the car is spent at highway speeds.  The first thing you will notice is the quietness.  Keep the breath mints and other loose items out of this car because I can assure you, you will hear them rattle around.

One of the first things I do with a new car is to wash it. I have found this is the best way to find any misalignment of body parts or paint and trim imperfections.  Well, there ain't any on this baby.  It is the best I have ever seen.

The rain sensing wipers work well if it is raining.  It is when it is only misting that they can't seem to decide how often to activate.  I have found it is best to just turn them off and manually activate them once in a while when this is the situation.

The rear view mirror dims appropriately when a car is the number of car lengths back that it is supposed to be.  However, once they get on your bumper it can't seem to compensate enough for the additional light and I find myself hand adjusting the mirror up or down to remove the offending glare.

Many VW owners have complained about AM radio reception.  Based on a tip from the vwpassat group at Yahoo Groups, I purchased the screw on antenna for a Honda S2000 and replaced the stock VW antenna.  For $20 I improved the reception to the point that while not perfect, it is something I can live with.

There have also been some postings regarding how quickly the automatic transmission shifts out of first.  In my case it did do this for about 5000 miles.  After that it appeared the computer became more accustomed to my driving style and I do not notice this happening anymore.

One other feature that I thought was a nice touch is the small button on the back left side of the steering wheel which will turn of the lights for the cruise and radio controls when making a long night drive.

Last week I had a chance to drive a 2002 Chevy Malibu for a week.  I put on 1200 miles going to Cincinatti & back.  If this car is any indication of what new car buyers can expect to come out of Detroit they better put on their Lederhosen and walk into the closest VW dealer to purchase a real car.
