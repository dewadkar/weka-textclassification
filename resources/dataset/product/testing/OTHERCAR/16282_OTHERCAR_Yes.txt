            I recently purchased an electrical yellow aerio sx, sport crossover. The color is inspired by Suzuki's motocross machines. I was impressed by its smooth acceleration, roomy interior as well as high-tech dash board. In fact, the US version, 2.0L engine is normal aspired version from SX concept car shown a year ago. The engine featured two stages timing chain with self-adjusting, virturally maintenance free. I believe it should have a potential to boost up to 220+ hp easily with Suzuki Sport supercharger. I love the factory accessories such as alum. inserts, door sills and second center spoiler. However, it takes a while to get them since it is very new in the market. Aerio will be featured for a long term development program in Sport Compact Car magazine in June issue. In addition, bunch of tuners have started getting their hands on this benchmark vehicle in new age. G-Formance is one of tuners and here is web address: www.r-sport.net
