            This is a review of the 1996 Honda Accord LX. I use this car for my daily commute, which is quite long. The Accord is a great work car. It has delivered great gas mileage (about 30 mpg), yet has the pickup you need for highway driving and merging.

Maintenance costs have been very low as my Honda has proven to be a very reliable car. The only unscheduled maintenance in the last 3 years has been an oxygen sensor.

While the Honda may not be the most distinctive car on the road, I feel it's one of the best values. There's so many of them out there because they're great cars. Nobody's going to turn their head to look at your Honda, but that's okay because you've got a dependable and somewhat fun automobile.

Pros: Very good performance and reliability.
Cons: Somewhat average looking, both inside and out.<br><br>
