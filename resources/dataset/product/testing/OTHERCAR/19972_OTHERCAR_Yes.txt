            Living in Texas, it is hot, and I mean HOT!  I just couldn't take driving to and from work in my beat up old Chevy truck in the heat anymore, so I made the big decision to buy a new vehicle.  My decision wasn't very difficult, being that I work at a Ford/Lincoln-Mercury dealership.  I am around these cars every day, and I see what type of vehicle has the most problems, etc.  The Mercury Tracer seemed to be one of the best cars that Mercury made, as well as the most affordable for me.  My employee discount helped as well.  In July of 99, I purchased a 99 Mercury Tracer, my first new car!  I just made my seventh payment, and it has been a wonderful car so far.  I love the gas mileage it gets, and knowing I have a good warranty in case anything does go wrong.  It is a very sensible vehicle, which I don't care for.  Very basic, small, four door vehicle.  I do find the back seat area a tight fit, and have had some under-the-hood troubles that they have been unable to diagnose.  This vehicle is great for new car buyers who are looking for a nice, small sized car, a step up from the escort.  This car is NOT for bigger people, as it is a tight fit!  All in all, I would recommend the Tracer, if you are not looking for something too flashy.<br><br>
