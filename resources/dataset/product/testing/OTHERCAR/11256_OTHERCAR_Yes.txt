                 Yes, it's &quot;Car and Driver's&quot; (10 best) winner in 1999, 2000 &amp; I'm predicting 2001.  Dodge Intrepid continues to tear up the road everywhere it goes.

     The first Intrepid I drove was a 97' model. Right there &amp; then I was in love with this car.  It was comfortable, roomy, quiet and catered to the drivers specifications.  It fit like a fine tailored suit, and with the 2001's standard features like:  &quot;driver &amp; passenger airbags, second power outlet, rear seat heat &amp; ac vents, PW, locks, and dual mirrors, there's so much already included, it's hard to add to it.

     If you're like myself, you're probably interested in what's under the hood.  The base model SE comes equipped with a 2.7L DOHC 24V SMPI V6 @ a whopping 200 horses!  Fuel - 20/28.  Sounds good?  wait till you get behind the wheel of the sleek RT with a powerful 3.5L Magnum SOHC 24V SMPI V6 @ a zippy 242 HP!!! fuel 18/26.

     The Intrepid is as comfortable as it is endowed.  It's the roomiest car in it's class and can seat 6 adults comfortably.  It has height adjustable seat belts, and the RT model's anti-lock breaking system allows you to maintain vehicle steering control in slippery situations by independently regulating brake fluid pressures.  Low speed traction control compliments the ABS with computerized pinpoint brake response to help stop slipping, free spinning wheels regain traction up to 35mph.

     All in all, Dodge is a superior American made vehicle company, and the Intrepid is a car in a class by itself.  This is just an Epinion, but if you're car shopping, The Intrepid has something for everyone.  priced between 20 - 26k (Quite average, by today's standard.)  There is no equal.<br><br>
