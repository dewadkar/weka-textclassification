            I was finally sound asleep after a terrible bought of insomnia when some idiot brought me out of my peaceful slumber by knocking on my door! I was practically fuming at the mouth when I pulled that door open (I'm not a morning person), ready to seriously maim whoever was out there. 

<i>&quot;What do you think...what? A package? Oh! My new digital camera!&quot;</i>
(I was so excited that I nearly hugged that UPS man!)

So was the start of my very first digital camera experience...needless to say, I didn't get back to sleep that morning. Immediately I (giddily) broke open the box and set to work figuring everything out.

The first thing I noticed was how small and sleek-looking this camera was. (For some reason I thought it would be bigger.) I liked the fact that it had a silver metal case and was heavy enough for good balance.

Since I hadn't had any previous experience with digital cameras, my worst fear was that it wouldn't include everything I needed to start taking pictures immediately. My fear was unfounded, though! Not only did I find everything I needed in that box, but there were also batteries! (I think I'm still going to purchase the adapter though...buying batteries is something I dislike very much.) The software included Adobe Photo Deluxe 3.1, and everything was easy to install and figure out.

I was a little surprised at everything this camera does. You can adjust the flash (or have no flash), adjust the LCD brightness, preview a pic before you take it, zoom (yeah, I know that's an obvious one), adjust the exposure, adjust the pic quality, adjust the resolution, add a template to the pic, add the date to a pic, select a language, magnify the pic to show details, run a slide show on your TV, and many more things but I don't want to take up TOO much room writing this epinion! :)

At first I was worried that this camera would be a &quot;battery sucker&quot;, but I've gotten about 5 hours (counting just picture taking and transferring to my computer) out of 4 AA photo life batteries, and I wasn't really being conservative about shutting the camera off when I didn't need it. 

I have found that the 4MB memory card that comes with this camera is plenty of space for me, but if you want to be able to take lots of high resolution/quality pics away from home I would suggest you upgrade to a bigger memory card. This card only holds 12 pictures on the highest resolution/quality setting, but if you're just going to be using this camera to put pics on the web I have found that the &quot;high resolution&quot; with &quot;better&quot; quality settings are just right. That gives you 18 pictures that the memory card will hold. Anyway, that's something for you to decide.

This is the first digital camera I've ever used so I don't have anything to compare it to...I'm sure there are better cameras out there, but I KNOW that this will do for the average person. The fact that I only paid $299.00 after shipping is also a big plus in my book!

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some pictures to take...<br><br>
