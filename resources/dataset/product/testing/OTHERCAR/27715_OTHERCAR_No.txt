            I loved my 94 Eclipse, but when I saw the new body style of the 96 I had to have it! My 94 Eclipse was very reliable. So I thought the 96 would be as well. The first 6 months were great. Then, at 6 months old the 96 Eclipse had problems starting up. Sometimes it took 16 turn overs to start, sometimes 6 turn overs, and sometimes it would start right a way. It is embarrassing on the days that it doesn't want to start. People always ask me "Do you need help?" and my reply is "No, it usually takes awhile for the car to start. It will start eventually." I'm sorry, but the car should be more reliable. I shouldn't have to make excuses for it! I've taken the car to three different Mitsubishi dealers. No one can diagnose what the problem is. The car is now at 70,000 and it's in the shop once a month for various problems. Extra changes of spark plugs, fuel filters, oxygen sensors etc. It wants premium gas which can be costly as well. It has become very high maintenance. Just beware of this as time goes by during your ownership. You may wind up spending less time driving it and more time paying for it.
