            This is truly the first Honda-made SUV since the Passport is an ISUZU &quot;DOO-DOO&quot; and it really shows.  Honda thought through this vehicle from the very start.  

Debuted in 1997, Honda has made very little in the form of changes to the vehicles itself -- they upped the horsepower about 25% at one point, changed from one stereo to another, and changed the seating fabric.  And for 2001 they offer a &quot;SE&quot; model with a few more upgrades.

All and all the vehicle performs like a true Honda--easy on the gas, reliable and trustworthy, well thought-out though some say &quot;utilitarian,&quot; and an all-round great vehicle.

It has some neat, &quot;might not ever use&quot; features like that pull out picnic table and the seats that fold into beds (would I really want to sleep here ---- only if my wife threw me out!)Plenty of storage spaces are built in and each passenger has their own cup holder.  

Customizing the CRV is no problem.  Plenty of OEM equipment exists for the vehicles plus many people have jumped on the CRV bandwagon with plenty of other accessories.  


The vehicle drives like a dream and is nimble in its toe-in.  Power in the engine could be a little better for the occasional mountain climb or trailer pull.

Otherwise, this is a great vehicle from top to bottom!  Great going Honda!!!
