            I bought this vehicle because it stood out above the rest. It was an amazing ride when I test drove it. The interior was so warm and luxurious.
The engine was big and strong and the car seemed solid.

I love the fact that this car turns heads. The ride is so smooth and enjoyable. The engine is strong and when in fourth gear this car has got plenty of power to give.

I hate the fact that the tranny needed to rebuilt 4 times!! And I don't think it still has been fixed right. If your going to get this tranny fixed...get a lifetime warranty. You will need it. And everything is expensive for this car....a tune-up was 300 dollars alone. Plus there is a weird smell that comes out of my car that has the mechanics stumped.

Anyone who wants to buy this vehicle be warned. Make sure you get ALL the service records and make sure that you put a tranny cooler to protect the transmission. It is definitely worth it. I say this car is not for the people who want something totally reliable but for the people who will put up with the problems should they occur....I say go for it. I will never sell my car...I have been thru too much with it. And I hear that those engines last about 250,000 miles....I am hoping to find out. I love it alot......=)
