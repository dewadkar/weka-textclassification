            We just bought a 2001.5 Passat GLX 4Motion for $28,000 at McKenna VW.  There are special factory incentives on the 2001.5's right now.  So if you find one, you should get a comparable deal.  This particular dealer is $1,000 less than other dealers in the So. California area. 

Basically, as compared to the Accord or Camry, the Passat has the option of 4WD.  If you need that, you don't have much of a choice in this segment.  You have to pay the premium for a Passat.  But for $28k, it really makes sense.  

The Accord, on other hand, is worth considering since this is the last model year and if you negotiate, you can get the EX V6 sedan for $22,700 or less.  While it has a little more power than the Passat, it lacks substance and features of the Passat.  For example, the Passat has a 5 speed tiptronic transmission (a clutchless manual option, even though it's also an automatic).  The Passat has other things like a homelink transmitter, and I think better interior materials.  The Passat feels like it has more room than the Accord.  And the Passat door close with a satisfying bank-vault like thud.  

The new Camry is competitive also.  While it has substantially improved, it has become pricey also.  I also have a 1997 Camry XLE V6 and have driven the 2002 Camry SE V6.  They don't compare to the Passat's steering and handling.  The Passat, simply put, is more precise and a more satisfying drive.  The Passat feels comparably roomy to the new Camry.

The new 3.5SE Altima is a great car too, but they have cut too many corners on the interior.  It looks and feels pretty cheap.  The V6 engine is wonderful, but Nissan has put only 1/2 of the sound deadening material as they did in the previous model.  While Nissan trumpets this as a result of a stiffer platform, the result is that you hear a lot more road noise on the freeway than you want to.  It is pretty on the outside, but so is the Passat.  And the Passat feels much more solid and expensive.  Plus the Passat's transmission lets you shift gears yourself, even if you get the automatic.  And the 3.5SE Altima is going for thousands over sticker right now because of a lack of supply.  It's just not a good deal for price.  

The downside is that I have heard that VW has had a history of quality issues, particularly with its electrical systems.  [Granted, biased sources since they are top engineers at Ford and stories from friends who have had problem VWs.]  While I don't think that the new Passat has bullet-proof quality like the Camry, I do like the overall package very much.  It is a very safe, expensive-feeling with wonderful components (audi 4WD systems, transmission and stretched A4 platform).  

Also, I would recommend against getting the extended warranty as it is over-priced breakdown insurance.  For the 2001.5 model, it has a 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty, which also covers the 4WD system.
