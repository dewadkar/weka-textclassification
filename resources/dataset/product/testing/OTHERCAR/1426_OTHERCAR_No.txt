            My wife and I purchased a 1998 Dodge Neon to provide more room for our family.  Our son was born in the fall of 1997 and that's when we realized the Nissan 240 SX wasn't going to cut it!  When we got to the dealership, I told the salesman we were looking for a car.  He asked what did we have in mind, so I replied &quot;An engine, 4 doors and 4 wheels...&quot;  

Yes, I was being cynical but I wanted to let him know that we were a young family on a budget.  We purchased our red Neon  for around $13k brand-new off the lot and drove home happily.  

After about 2 months the car began to shake on the highway

After about 4 months we began to notice the interior noise kept getting louder.  

After about 6 months the &quot;Service Engine Soon&quot; light kept intermittently flashing.

We kept taking our car in to find out what the problem was.  Time and time again, they kept saying it was a minor problem (filter here, spark plugs their, &quot;quirky sensors&quot; over there...)  After a year of service visits later, it was finally found out that the car had a cracked head!  This was after we began to see oil leaking onto our carport's cement pad.  And we wondered why the mileage was so bad.  

We took it in the last time and had to tell the Service Rep &quot;Don't call us back until you've found the problem and fixed it...and don't take forever either!&quot;  It took them 4 business days to get our car back to us.

This experience makes me really not want to buy American cars.  Yes I know the Neon isn't the top of the line model.  But a cracked head shouldn't be happening within the first 36,000 miles either!

We'll be trading in this car as soon as we can decide whether we want a minivan or SUV.<br><br>
