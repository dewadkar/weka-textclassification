            My '94 E420 was bought new from European Motors in Oakland,CA and has been serviced only by that dealer. From delivery it has had an intermittent problem of power failure which the dealer called a &quot;rough idle&quot; problem.  Neither Mercedes, nor the dealer has taken this problem seriously enough to fix it.  Nor would they buy the car back (even for book value), as required by the Calif. lemon law(which requires they buy back at original price.)  Mercedes flaunting of the law has been stunning!  They just say &quot;sue us.&quot;  

I would not ever recommend that anyone buy a Mercedes of any type.  Because, while I'm sure that most are good cars, even Mercedes makes an occasional lemon.  And if you get one, Mercedes WILL DO NOTHING TO RECTIFY IT.<br><br>
