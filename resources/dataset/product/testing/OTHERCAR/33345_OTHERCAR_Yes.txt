            My husband, the researcher/engineer, did the whole Internet thing, narrowing down the choices to replace his Pontiac Wagon. Then we tried them all out.  Like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, some were too big (I had enough truck-driving when we rented a U-Haul), some were too small -- no kidding, some Japanese models were more cramped than airline seats.  And then the Pathfinder came along. Bill is over 6 feet, and it fits him just fine.  He also approves of the lumbar adjustment. On trips I can drive hours easily, without fatigue.  

The body is totally adjustable.  The back seats fold down to make cargo space, or pop up for civilized guest accommodations. And you don't need the manual to operate them.  

We have always driven Ford and GM, so the controls for lights, wipers, etc. took some adjusting to.  Then one day I finally comprehended their simple logic... push the left stalk down for brights, push the right stalk down for windshield wash.  Now I'm spoiled. The speed control took more adapting. It turns on with a rocker switch located left of the steering wheel, instead of ON the wheel which I think is more convenient.

Finally, we have had great positive experience with dealers.  We bought a 5 year warranty and need to have oil changed, service done by the book. They make it quick and easy.  <br><br>
