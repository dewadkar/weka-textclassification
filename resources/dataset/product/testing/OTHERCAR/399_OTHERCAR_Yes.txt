            This was my second SUV and first buy of the Nissan brand. I was strongly considering the Pathfinder but found them to be somewhat overpriced as is the 4Runners from Toyota. I found a great deal on a white Xterra SE model with all the options I wanted except for four wheel drive. The engine is a V6 with 170 horses that could be a bit more in my humble opinion but low end torque is excellent. The sound system could use some improvement. There is plenty of room inside and the roof rack holds a lot of stuff! The fit and finish is excellent, as can be expected from any vehicle NOT made in the U.S.<br><br>
