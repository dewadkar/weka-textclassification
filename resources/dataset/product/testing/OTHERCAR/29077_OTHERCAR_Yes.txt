            My friend has a 1992 Jeep Wrangler. This was his first vehicle and he doesn't have a bad word to say about it. My favorite thing about this vehicle is riding in it in the summer; it is awesome to strip it down! We take off the top and the doors when it is nice and go cruising. He has a hard top, which has a middle piece that can come out alone. 

The hard top is a nice thing to have in the winter heat wise. The stereo will also sound better because of the added insulation. I also like the fact that you can do so many things to dress up a Jeep. 

My friend sunk a lot of money in because of extra parts but it looks great! The only downfall is the rough ride, but it is a Jeep, what do you expect?
