            i bought a 99 galant ES in 9/99

the good:
- quiet, quiet engine
- extremely smooth ride
- lots of high end torque =&gt; great for passing/weaving on highways!
- cheap!
- doesn't look like your momma's car (at least in black)
- capable of holding 4 cups!

the not so good:
- handling
- unpredictable transmission
- not much leg room in back
- cabin lights don't light up the back seat at all


i couldn't get my hands on a manual, and the automatic transmission isn't as steady and regular as honda's and toyota's...  things that were cool are the &quot;smart&quot; idle speed (adjusts to how fast your driving.)  the fuel light is kinda fishy, though.  it comes on when i have 4-5 gallons left of gas.  the standard sound system is pretty terrible as well.  the only problem i've had (other than the headlight switch recall- headlights came on for no reason randomly) is that my battery has died without explanation a couple times in the last few months.  i'm currently investigating, will post an update.<br><br>
