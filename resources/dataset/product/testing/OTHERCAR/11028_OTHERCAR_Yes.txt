            Whether you have kids, take long trips, or simply just haul things, the Chevy Astro is a great car to have.  It provides room enough for six (other than the driver) and is able to sit them fairly comfortably for long trips that might be made.  My family has had their Astro for many years now, and it has allowed them to make numerous road trips, as well as provide a very convenient means to move and haul things.  With a fair amount of ease, the back seat is able to be either removed, or just fold in order to maximize the amount of cargo space available for use.  The car itself has seen my family through three children, and has far outlived what my family originally planned to keep it for.  As far as cons to the Chevy Astro, there seems to be a limited amount.  It requires a fair amount of service and maintenance now, but no more than other automobiles of that age. One problem that I have noticed with the interior itself, however, is that of drink storage.  In all of the vehicle, only four cup-holders are seen.  This is a rather deficient amount, considering that the van's capability includes long road trips and holding numerous children.  Other storage, however, seems to be relatively abundant.  Door pockets can be found on each of the front doors; another pocket beside the middle bucket seats; and two more in the rear to serve as ice chests or other items.<br><br>
