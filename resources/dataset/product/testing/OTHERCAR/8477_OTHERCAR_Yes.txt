            We bought this camera to replace our stolen 35mm (film) camera. So it is our first digital camera. 
In my research for a new digital camera I concluded that 2 mega pixels would be enough for our mostly 4x6" snap-shot taking family. I also I decided the camera had to have a minimum of a 2X optical zoom. It would also have to have a viewfinder so I would not have to remove my glasses to see the LCD screen. Anyway the last requirement ruled out the Nikon CoolPix 2500 which seemed to rank high in all the reviews.
I ended up with the FinePix 2600 because I basically cannot pass up a good deal. Target was selling these on clearance for $234. Plus, while at the store I seemed to remember that the Fuji cameras reviewed had excellent picture quality. Had I not seen this deal I probably would have bought the Canon S200.
After using the camera for a couple weeks I am 95% happy with the camera. The 5% unhappy is due to the camera using the Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries instead of the newer Lithium-Ion batteries. In order to get the best use from these batteries you need to use them until they are totally discharged and then charge them up fully. The problem with this is if you leave your camera sitting around for a few days after taking a few shots and then have a need to take it to some event, you cannot "top off" the battery. Instead, for extra insurance you really need to carry a spare set of batteries. You can top off Lithium-Ion batteries. I ended up buying extra batteries to carry as backups. A positive point here is the batteries are fairly inexpensive.
There are many good points to the camera. Size for one. The camera is pretty small although not as small as the Canon S200 small. The height and width is very small - the depth dimension could be a little smaller though.
The biggest plus for me was the very short shutter lag time.  That is the time it takes from when you press the shutter button to the time the camera actually takes the photo. This is a parameter that is frequently tested in camera reviews and although I haven't actually tested it, it seems really short. You don't even notice it. Also the time it takes before you can take the next shot is very short. These times are supposed to vary with the resolution setting so for me it can only get better because I always have mine on the highest setting.
Picture quality is excellent.  The exposures always seem right on. The camera focuses very quickly so my pictures are all in focus. I always seem to forget to give the camera that extra fraction of a second to let it focus itself but so far I haven't beat it. Probably just lucky though.
You do, however, get the "red eye" syndrome with this camera. Not in all shots but it does show up more than occasionally.
One other great thing about the camera is that is easy to use in a point and shoot mode. That's the way my wife is used to taking pictures so she is very happy with this camera.
One bad thing, besides the batteries, is the lens cover. It just seems to get in the way when I take a picture. I end up pushing it partially closed when I press the shutter release. I am having to re-train myself how holding a camera.
The software that comes with camera is just OK. I am currently trying other software. Microsoft's Picture It! seems to be the best so far for us. But software can be a personal choice.
When you weigh the good and bad points and consider the price this camera is fantastic. You would probably have to spend another $100 or so to match the picture quality and features this camera has. Just have to get used to carrying spare batteries around - kind of like carrying an extra roll of 35mm film.
