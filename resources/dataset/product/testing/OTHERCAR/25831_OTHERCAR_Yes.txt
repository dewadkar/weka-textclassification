            My 1986 Jeep Cherokee Pioneer has met and far exceeded any expectation I had at the time I purchased it.  With currently 259,860 miles on the odometer, the engine has never required any major service.  It doesn't burn or use any oil between changes and still idles with 20 lbs of oil pressure with 30 lbs at cruise.  The clutch was changed once at 130,000 miles and only minor things have required service over its life.  Fuel economy has ranged between 18 mpg (city) to 22.5 (highway).

When I purchased the vehicle, I needed a dependable vehicle with a reasonable amount of room for carrying things.  I was also looking for something that would give me some driving confidence in winter weather and on rough wilderness roads.  The Jeep I chose was a basic model with the 4-cylinder engine with 5-speed manual transmission.  The body is the 2-door version since I don't carry other people with me a lot of the time.  

It is somewhat rough riding if you are used to a standard 4-door sedan and the steering is not as precise as I would like. I also find the french-built transmission to be somewhat balky on cold mornings. 
 
Overall I like the intermediate size.  The driving position places you up-higher than most cars which helps visibility.  At the same time it is NOT some huge monstrosity that doesn't fit in any parking place.  It offers an excellent compromise, in my opinion, to the needs of everyday transportation, weekend off-main-road travel, and difficult winter driving conditions.  At the same time it has provided me with excellent dependability and long-term transportation at extremely low cost (approximately $0.14/mile).

I have just purchased a second Jeep Cherokee (1998).  This new one offers all the benefits of the old one, plus a much more powerful 6-cylinder engine, automatic transmission, and many other options.  On the new one, the steering preciseness is excellent and it is much more quiet than the old one.
