            This is a very good car for any kind of person. Young, Professional, or Older. Families will love this car, while it doesn't shun young drivers. This car reminds me of a Honda Accord. It is sporty and attracts a wide range of buyers. When I rode in this car, I couldn't find any weaknesses. General Motors isn't the most reliable company, so the car may have problems down the road, but I didn't notice anything. 

The interior is well designed. The back seat is very large for a smaller family car. and there is room for three adults, even if they are crowded.
The front controls are very well designed. The driver display is not crowded and has a tachometer as well as the other normal meters. The climate and radio controls are easy to use, while the buttons seem a little to large (GM used to make buttons too small, now they do the opposite). The seats are supportive, and hold the passengers well. 

The engine the Malibu sports is very impressive. It is a standard V6 which is almost too powerful. Some people may only need a four-cylinder, but must opt for the more powerful six. This isn't really a bad thing because this engine moves! The power and acceleration are very good for a car of this size. 

For music enthusiasts, this car's stereo system is a class-act. I doubt it is as good as what you'll find in a luxury car, but for the price and class, you can't go wrong. The bass is very solid, a feature many younger drivers like. 

Overall, if you are in the market for a smaller family car, give your attention to the Malibu. The engine alone is a good reason to buy this over the Accord or Camry.<br><br>
