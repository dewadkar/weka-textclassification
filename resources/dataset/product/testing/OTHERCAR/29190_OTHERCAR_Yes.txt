            I LOVE my 1999 Dodge Neon!  Because year 2000 cars are now the &quot;hot&quot; models, you can find great deals as far as price for the brand NEW 1999 models.  I have heard there were a lot of mechanical problems in the older neons.  The company heard all about these problems and has corrected all of them.  I have had my car for almost a year now and had NO PROBLEMS at all.  It drives well and handles very smooth.  My mom loves driving it and even my over 6 feet tall boyfriend and dad enjoyed driving it (and they FIT into it!!).  It gets great gas mileage, has required no maintenance (except a routine oil change), and it's a really CUTE and fun little car!  It looks sporty AND it has a huge amount of room for passengers.. it's just a really great car, especially since the brand new 99 models are so cheap as they try to make room for 2000!<br><br>
