            Well the Toyota Tacoma is a great truck and, These trucks will go alot of miles and still work.  There is also a huge amount of after market products for this truck. Its light weight and powerfull engine makes it fast, but still retains great MPG. The tacoma comes in many ways.  You can get extended cab, you can get the 2.7 or the 3.4L engines.  With the 3.4v6 you can add a supercharger made by toyota that will boost the power to 275 and doubles the torque. So with a small tacoma you can out pull a fullsize. Plus you can not beat these trucks off road, they are the best factory made vecials for off roading made.  That is why there are one of the most common trucks used for recreation,, next to jeep. If you are in the market for a compact truck, this is the one to buy.
