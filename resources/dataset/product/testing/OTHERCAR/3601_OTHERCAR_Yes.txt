            I have been shooting digital for 2 years now.  I started with Kodak DC215, then the Canon S10.  I sold them to keep upgrading.  I did have the Canon D30 for a short time but sold it because I was spending too much time in photoshop with it.  I wanted something a little more simple and easy to carry.   Now I have the Canon G2.  

I bought in Feb. 2003 and have loved it since.  It is not the latest point and shoot from Canon, but for me it meets all my needs.  Easy to carry.  Great colors.  I don&#146t change any camera sharpness settings and I don&#146t sharpen before printing.  I love the picture quality.  I send out my keeper shots to photoaccess.com and the quality is far superior to my 35mm Canon Elan II.  With the film, much is dependent on the photo lab.  It just is not consistent.  I have found photoaccess.com to be amazingly consistent.  

I shot both film and digital on vacation of many of the same things.  In all cases the digital pictures were by far better in color, and overall image quality.  I was shooting with a sharp Canon 50mm f1.8 lens too.  I also shoot with an alienbees strobe for portrait work and the G2 works well with that.  

For just a home hobbyist, I can&#146t complain about the G2.  I don&#146t know what I would gain by upgrading to G5.  I can&#146t justify the cost.  Since I do have a nice Canon f1.8 50mm lens, I probably will buy the Canon 10D in the future.  It would be nice to get the blurred background and sharp foreground shots.  I will still keep my G2 though because it is so good, easy to carry, and easy to use.  

The only time I will use unsharp mask is for email and eBay after I resize for the web.  For prints, I just print straight from the jpeg file with no adjustments needed.  I don&#146t have time to mess with photoshop.   Maybe by shooting RAW and tweaking in photoshop it could be slightly better, but right now I am happy as is straight from the camera.  I am not using film anymore because of the great results I have gotten with the G2.
