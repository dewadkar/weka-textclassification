            If all you are looking to do is grab shots for Web pages or to email around, this modest little number should do the job.

OK optics and fairly clear directions should have to snapping clean shots within minutes. They won't be the match of your 35mm, but with over hundred per each 8 megs of flash media, you'll have plenty of them. You could also bump up the quality for fewer, more detailed pics, but what's the point?

Good flash with red-eye reduction means head shots look great. Can get washed out in bright sunlight without manual correction, but the finished product can always be adjusted with Olympus' decent photo-editing software.

This package is fairly amazing as most bundled 'ware is crud, but this will handle most needs fine. 

On the down side, you'll have to spring $69-99 for a USB flash mem reader if you want have quick access to your pics. Otherwise it is several minutes waiting for a included parallel port transfer to move a gaggle of pics.
Not maddening, just a pain.

As is to be expected with all such devices, they eat batteries like Rosie O'Donnell does Ho-Hos. Invest in rechargable batteries and a recharger or go broke.
