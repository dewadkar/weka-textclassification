               I own a 1994 Chevrolet Suburban. I purchased it used in 1997 and have absolutely fallen in love with this vehicle. Why? Several reasons.......

   The ride. The Suburban has an incredibly smooth ride. Whether it's due to it's fantastic support system, good shocks, the nice, wide body, or even the cushy seats, this truck rides like a dream. After long car trips, my family arrives feeling well rested an none the worse for wear.

   The handling. Turning this vehicle is easy and feels stable. A lot of SUVs feel unstable at tight turns, but the Suburban handles them without even a lean.

   The space! Oh, what space! With the rear seats folded down, you can carry 8 foot lengths of lumber in the back! Wow! That's a lot of room! Plus, there's plenty of head room available in the Chevrolet Suburban as well. That's a nice benefit if you're on the tall side.

   The weather. Yes, I said the weather. The Suburban offers zoned climate comfort controls for the three sections of the vehicle. Whether this is a standard feature or an additional option, make sure you take advantage of this benefit. It's a terrific feature if you have an infant and want to keep them a bit warmer than the passengers in the front.

   The luxury. Power seats, power windows, power locks, automatic side mirror controls,cruise control,  these are all features that make this vehicle make all others pale in comparison.

   This truck is rugged. In for the long haul? Try a 42 gallon gas tank! Sure, it's pricey when you fill up, but how often do you have to? We get about 750 miles per tank. No, it's not an economy car, but you need lots of go go juice to haul this beast around town!

   Economy. Yes, I said economy. Replacement parts for the Suburban are quite inexpensive and finding someone who can make repairs is pretty easy.

   The Chevrolet Suburban is a terrific vehicle for families on the go. It can accommodate 8 passengers with plenty of elbow room. The sound system offers speakers even to those riding in the rear. Shoulder seatbelts are available for all passengers other than the mid seat in the second row. <br><br>
