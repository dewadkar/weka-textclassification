            My father has always had Toyota trucks for as long as i remember. He had to have a good dependable truck that would withstand the things he had to put it through. He has worked in the oil fields for 18 years, and all of his Toyotas have lasted. His last Toyota he had before it finally went, had 256,000 miles on it. He did have to get a new bed for it because they like to rust and rot out. The motors last forever though. If you ask anyone with a foreign vehicle what they think about their vehicle, they will tell you that the motor is excellent. My father broke down about 4 years ago and bought a Tacoma. He loves it. He is out of the oil business now so he doesn't have to beat on it.  The gas mileage is very good and you can put quite a load in it before she starts to squat. The four wheel drive is also great. These trucks will go anywhere and outlast any American vehicle on the market today!I am a Chevy fan myself, hence my internet name is Bowtie01. I will be looking to get a new truck here soon and I am leaning toward the Tacoma. I need something that will last and withstand the adventures I will put it through<br><br>
