            Last year with the upcoming birth of our second daughter we decided that we needed to purchase a bigger vehicle.  I knew I wanted a minivan but was not sure what make or model to buy.  I bought the consumer reports for used automobiles and figured out that Dodge Caravan would be the best choice for us.  We bought a 1996 Dodge Caravan used with only 35,000 miles on it.
This was the best purchase I have ever made!!!  I really do not know how  I ever did it with a small car before.  The caravan allows us to fit both our children, our dog, toys and groceries all into the vehicle and still have room to breath!  It is a very smooth ride.  Even on snow and ice the Caravan handles superbly.  
We have now had it for over a year and have not had any problems.  The only thing that I would do differently next time would be that I would buy the Caravan with 2 side doors rather than the 1 side door.  Would make it easier to get children in and out.  I would also make sure it had power windows!!  The windows are pretty big and you feel like you are cranking forever in order to open them.  All in all though I am completely satisfied and when the time comes to trade it in I will definitely go with another Dodge product.<br><br>
