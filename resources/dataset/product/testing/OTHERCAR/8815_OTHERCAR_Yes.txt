            After reading Dr.Ps' comments on the new Honda 2001 Accord EX V6 I had to add my comments. My wife and I first looked at a 2001 Passat V6, $32,000. Then a 2001 Audi A6, $38,000. They are both very much alike. A friend suggested taking a Honda for a test ride. He has two Hondas. It was love at first drive. The Accord EX V6 sedan cost me $23,374. The window sticker is $25,100 and $440.00 delivery charge. There are no other factory installed extras.
 The more I drive the car the more I really like it. Two of my friends after driving my car have also purchased 2001 Accords. I have only 2,000 miles on the car and have been getting 27.9 miles to the gal. on the highway with 5 people in the car with luggage. City driving 22.4 miles to the gal. The comments about the road noise is correct and I knew about this before hand from magazines and Edmunds on line. My 94' Subaru has the same replacement tires on it and I have the same road noise with those tires. They were rated number one in a consumers magazine so I'll put up with the noise for a quality product.
 You only realize what a great product the car is after driving it and reading the manual to find out all the features the car has. I could go on and on about the things that I like about the car but if you do your homework and you can find a better car with more features and quality I will be surprised.<br><br>
