             We bought our 1993 dodge intrepid five years ago. It had 90,000 miles on it, and we paid 5,000 for it.
 It now has 141,000 miles on it and is a daily driver. i have made up my mind to never own another econobox again. 
 This car has the base engine (3.3) in it, so power is adequate. This particular car was part of a fleet, so it is a basic car- it's even white in color. There are no real surprises here- maintenance has been pretty straightforward- some hoses,, one water pump,one thermostat,and a bottle of barsleak, along with recharging the a/c, and changing the oil, and brakes. That's it for maintenance. It has been paid for for years, and it faithfully puts in 300 miles or so every week. The power is smooth, as is the ride, and it goes well in inclement weather. There is plenty of room in this ride- both back and front seats have plenty of room-even for larger folks. The fuel milage averages 25 miles to the gallon- sometimes more.
