            This new digital camera from Sony was being shown off at a local photography show this weekend where a large crowd gathered around.  I was extremely amazed at the number of people that gazed towards the presenters as this camera was being shown off to the crowd. I decided soon after that I had to have a look for myself at this new camera and I certainly was not disappointed. Luckily, I not only got the chance to see a full demonstration of this fine piece of equipment and use it for myself a bit, but my friend also decided to purchase one for himself.  I will look forward to using it in the future a great deal more and continue to notice the many reasons to be excited with this model.

First of all, the main draw to this camera is the fact that it uses new CD-R digital storage technology.  This allows for storage of images for up to one hundred years.  Supposedly, over time, the quality of the image will not diminish.  This camera also offers an immense 2.1 megapixels which offers great image quality.  The pictures that result are truly of professional quality.  Furthermore, the digital technology has made it possible to create and store images at a cost of only 2 cents an image to the user.  This allows for much cheaper photography in the long run even though this unit does boast a $1300 dollar initial outlay.  This price, although a lot of money, is comparable to the other cameras of this type.  As far as I know there are only 3 total models comparable to this and this particular camera from Sony is regarded as one of the finest thus far.  Some other great features that this camera possesses are an MPEG Movie mode and 200m playback which really make this unit a respectable movie camera as well.  I found that the image quality remains great when using these impressive features.

The only real drawback to the Sony MVC - CD100 is the fact that it is a bit cumbersome.  This makes it somewhat hard to operate at first; however, I found that with a bit of practice the user will eventually get used to the large unit.  All in all, this is a great camera and the technology that it holds really makes up the future of photography.  If you are a serious photographer with a bit of money to spend, this unit is certainly worthy of a look.<br><br>
