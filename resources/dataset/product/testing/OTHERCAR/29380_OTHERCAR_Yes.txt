            Think of this car as a cheaper, yet roomier and more comfortable version of the Lexus ES300.  This car is has a soft ride, is whisper quiet, and has a huge trunk and excellent leg room.  Although built on the base of a Camry, the Avalon is cavernous, while maintaining its non-bulky luxurious look on the outside.  It has snappy acceleration, and steers straight and true at high speeds.  My Avalon has gone 28,000 miles in about 14 months, and I've had NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER.  The price was excellent.  Security system, alloy wheels, wheel locks, CD Player, 6 speakers, and leather seats for under $28,000.

The best thing about this car is its backseat.  Being a lanky 6 feet tall, i climb in and out of the backseat with ease, and no longer suffer from leg pain from having to sit uncomfortably!  The base supports of the front seats are moved totally out of the way, so your legs can roam free.  When I moved the front seats all the way up, it felt as if i was in a Mercedes SEL600! (which i HAVE been in, so i do know!  It is quite amazingly large)

Here are some of the highlights of the car:

-200HP engine gets pretty good mileage considering the size and weight of this car.  Acceleration is quick.  You can't really tell you're driving a sedan classified as a large car.  There's a ECT PWR button, which is supposed to give more powerful acceleration.  I haven't really put this to the test yet.

-Suspension ~ seems extra soft, car seems to bob a bit more than necessary.  Danger of floorpan hitting the ground on sharp bumps!

-Factory installed windshield wiper blades:  had to RIP them out.  No apparent way to take them out!

-Paint job ~ chips somewhat easily.  My 60 mile a day commute at an average speed of 65 MPH has resulted in many small pebble sized circles where the paint has been totally removed, revealing the black body of the car.  These chips are located in the front bumper of the car.  The paint seems to be very thin.  

-HUGE TRUNK with FULL SIZED SPARE hidden UNDER the trunk mat.  You can't even tell it's there.

-The sound system has a good bass, yet it doesn't put enough emphasis on vocals, so they are often drowned out in a song.  The bass/treble controls don't really do too much to help.  CD Player is seeks VERY fast, and NEVER skips.  The more advanced functions are confusing on the sound system in general.  However, the basic functions are very simple to learn, and require no use of the manual.  In general, almost all the functions of the car don't require any use of the manual.  

-The cup holder.  Plasticy, cheap feeling.  Placed right behind the shifter in the center console; drinks placed there are often elbowed.

-In general, the knobs and buttons in the car feel a bit loose and plasticy, with the exception of the door handles, which feel top quality.  You can't expect much from a car that shares a ton of parts with the Camry, which isn't exactly a luxury car.

-Sunshades had to be BANGED out to pivot to the side.  And BANGED back in.  They're somehwat heavy and clunky.

-No lumbar support for passenger front seat, only for driver.

-Power seats worked excellently, no problems here.

-It's a shame there's no backseat to trunk access.  Nor are there any cup holders built into the center fold-down.

-Leather seats showed some stitching the day we got the car, and seemed to have gotten slightly worse since then.

-AMAZING amount of leg room for the backseat

-QUIET interior.

-They couldn't put headrests on the backseats of the Avalon, yet they could for the Corolla which costs half as much?!?  What is this?!?  An outrage!  Even though you can't lean your head all the way back due to the lack of a headrest, i found that if you move your head off to the side, there's a VERY COMFORTABLE little nook for your head where you can sleep for HOURS.  I slept 8 hours on a road trip up to Maine, and awoke quite refreshed.

I definitely recommend this to any family, especially if there are tall people in the family.  It is a great alternative to the Camry.  If you're going to get a Camry for about $25,000, why not kick in a few extra G's and get something nicer, roomier and not so common?  Expect SUPERB reliability and great gas mileage.
