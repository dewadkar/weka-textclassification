            After 2 years driving a company car - a real beater - around Mexico City, I was ripe to get something with a bit more pizzaz and zip.  I bought a 530i used from a dealership in MA.  My second choice was a new VW Passat, but there was a $5,000 price difference and I just didn't feel the same 'weight' with the Passat as I did with the BMW.

I'll start with hates: oil changes at the dealership can be obscenely expensive, and every last repair makes me catch my breath with shock at the cost.  I haven't had ANY problems with the car - all repairs have been pro-active, but I will NEVER get used to the maintenance costs.  No cup holder kind of stinks too.  That's it for hates.

Loves:  
* It's a beautiful car (mine is black with black leather interior), and I have had more compliments on it over the years - it's really a lovely shape and when it's clean and glossy, heads turn.  
* The drive, the 8 cylinders gives you this gut sense of confidence.  If someone is tailgating, I press the gas, and I am a mile away before they even figure it out.
* I have been the only car on the road to miss multiple car pile-ups because of the response and speed.  This car has, literally, saved my life on several occasions.
* It's comfortable - with heated power seats, arm rests, it's my favorite for long drives.

It's a loud, but assured drive, with that definitive feeling of power and pull that you can command.  I love the manual speed, and have found it to be useful in snow (plus the optional traction control - a must).  If you are looking for something light and 'zippy', this ain't it.

If you've got the dough for those occasionally painful dealership visits, and mostly highway drives, this is the car for you..<br><br>
