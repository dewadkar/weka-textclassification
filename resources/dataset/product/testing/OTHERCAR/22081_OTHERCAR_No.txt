            I have had my Kodak DC-215 for about a week now. It was buy far worth every cent paid for it. If you think you need to spend $1,000 for a GOOD digital camera, think again. This camera was on sale at 2 places for $350, regular price is $400. Within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box, I was taking pictures. It is very simple to set up and install both memories and batteries-the instructions were very clear and simple.
This camera comes with loads of built in features. It has a crystal clear LED viewer so you can see what you are taking a picture of before you take it. As soon as you take a picture, you get a color photo on the LED showing you the picture. You can then enlarge the pic to see it better or trash it. The quality of these digital photos has amazed us all! They look like regular 35 mm pictures!
This camera also comes with a serial port adapter. Just plug one end into the camera, one end into the serial port and your pictures are on your computer screen. It also comes with Kodak DC software, Adobe Pagemill and Photoshop, all of which were easy to install and set up.
I cannot say enough good things about this camera. The only drawback is that it does use batteries fast, especially if you use the LED viewer(which is optional). We went through 4 double AA batteries in about 2 hours. So I recommend buying an AC adapter. Other than that, wait for a sale and get one. They are definately worth it if you are in the market for a digital camera.<br><br>
