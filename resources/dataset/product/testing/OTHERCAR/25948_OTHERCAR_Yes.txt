            Well, if you are looking for a car, this is the one, 
1. Exterior- this car is beautiful. its as good as a sportscar, and a lot less expensive. Most come with a sunroof which adds to the beauty of the car. easy access to the trunk and unlocking with the convienient keychain, with turn on buttons. 
2. interior- this car is a beauty. with a cd player, cruising in your car has never been more fun. it has a large glove compartment. the seats are comfortable and safe. the seats have a nice button to adjust the hight of the seats. they have electric windows and rier view mirror control too. tired of kids playing with windows. there is a window lock and control feature in the driver seat.tired of breaking your back to reach the trunk open button. well not any more. it has a button on the side of the door.

This is a good car and highly recommended. Not overwhelmingly expensive
