            I've bought this digicam about a year and a half ago for $220 at Best Buy.  Little did i know, the week after the price was lowered to $200 and which ticked me off a bit. I'm sure the price has gone down even more now. It was okay though, I still think I got my money's worth investing in this digicam.

I've been using this camera quite frequently, but not on a daily basis, and is still in very excellent working condition.  The only problems I've had with this digicam is that the picture quality does not come out to a perfect crisp.  Whenever pictures are taken in darker areas, the image seems to become a bit distorted or filled with "noise".  On the other hand, exposures taken in bright light such as a sunny day outside is excellent.  Keep this in mind...you get what you pay for.  Another problem that I've experienced with this camera is that it doesn't handle extreme heat or being in sun for too long(with the screen facing up) because it'll ruin the screens giving it white spots which are unrepairable.  This does not affect the images however, but its just annoying to see it when you're previewing on the screen.  I did not do this to my camera, I let my friend borrow it for his vacation and he ruined it for me! But that's ok...he bought me another memory stick to make up for it =).

Hooking the camera up to the USB slot to transfer files is rather quick, but this really depends on how big the file is. (USB cable is included)

The battery life is awsome, I can leave it on for hours and hours and hours, etc. and it would finally need recharging.  The only downside to this is that it requires 13 hours of charging time in order to use. (2AA Batteries and battery case included)

Thin sturdy carrying strap included.
