            When I heard that Sony was coming out with a digital camera that you could hook up on your computer threw a floppy disk it attracted me to getting the Sony MVC-FD81. If you have no patience with connecting cameras to tv's and getting tapes and rewinding and stuff like that than this is the perfect camera for you. The quality of the pictures is amazing. You really cant tell the difference from a more expensive camera and this one.  You can choose between Standard and Fine image quality, depending on the importance of what you're shooting. When you've finished, simply take out the floppy, pop it in your PC, and view it through your A: drive and image viewer. Then you can copy it to your hard drive, erase the floppy, and use it over and over. This camera is wonderful.  Ever since we bought this digital camera we have been taking pictures a lot more than we use to.  This digital camera would be the perfect gift for your dad on fathers day.  Im telling you he will be very happy you got this camera for him.  I know my dad is going to be.<br><br>
