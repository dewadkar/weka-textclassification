            <b>Well I finally mustered up the courage to report to you a tragic story in which I lost control and crashed an M3 I was test driving.</b>  OK, it wasn't really a big crash - but it was an agricultural excursion the likes of which few M3s have likely seen.

It was a beautiful sunny day in the middle of summer and I was toying with the idea of selling the 911 and jumping up to an M3.  I had driven a Boxster the week before and it really was a bit underwhelming compared to my Euro 911.  I found a perfect red M3 which had black leather, low miles, and <b>in spite of having absolutely every high-dollar performance goodie you could imagine - hadn't ever seen any track time or autocrosses.</b> 

The owner took me for a ride first - I was a little uncomfortable with the way he was driving having known him for exactly 5 minutes.  The M3 seemed able to handle curves with ease that I would never dream of throwing the 911 into.  

Then it was my turn - With the permission (and encouragement) from the owner, I sent the Pole Position S-02s howling on a deserted country road and was <b>amazed at the neutral balance of the car.</b>  The lowered suspension with H&amp;R springs, the steering, gearing - everything back to the SuperSprint exhaust seemed well matched, smooth and predictable.

<b>Then, quite unexpectedly, in a corner I know very well - everything changed...violently...</b>

In reflecting on this series of events I wasn't even pushing the car as hard as the owner when he was driving, and before the corner - I thought I was actually being conservative.  I was wrong - in a big way!

As I approached the uphill right hand corner - perfectly banked - <b>I heel and toe downshifted from 3rd to 2nd gear and started the turn up the hill - when SUDDENLY the rear snapped loose pointing me straight over an embankment.</b>  Within a split second we were off the road - I had managed to immediately counter-steer to the left and had the car pointed in the right direction with the accelerator pegged trying to get some traction on the slippery gravel slope (while trying to avoid the inevitable backward roll-over).  At this point all the weight was on the right rear and the front left wheel was nearly in the air.  With the steering wheel cranked hard left, then hard right and accelerator planted we were running out of forward momentum.  Any less and we'd be rolling over backwards over the hill.  With every last hope and prayer used up, we had just enough momentum to get the left rear tire onto the pavement and managed to pull out of the gravel and back onto the road. - 

This episode exemplifies (besides the driver with a temporary head of rocks) the notorious snap oversteer condition you might have heard about in M3s.  Let me tell you - it ain't pretty.  Luckily, the owner and I were OK.  The car was OK structurally but needed some paint work on the lower portion of the door from the foot of gravel we traversed.  The owner was a saint about the whole terrible event.  If someone had done that to my car I probably would have pummeled them with nearest blunt object.  Needless to say, lesson learned.  

I paid for the repairs out-of-pocket, but reconsidered buying the car as a result of the sheer unpredictability of it's handling close to the limit.  Overall - this car begs for more at the apex of each turn, a perfect car up to 98% of the limit - get beyond that range and prepare to enter the seldom seen, seldom talked about, tilt-a-whirl, Mr. Hyde world of the M3.

Hang on!
