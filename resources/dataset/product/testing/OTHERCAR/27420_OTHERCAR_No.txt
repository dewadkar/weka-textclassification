            In 1995 I needed a car that was good on gas and I needed one quick. This is when the Neon was still being boasted on the radio and TV and held itself up for being economic. So, I bought a 4-door 1995 fresh off the lot.
<b>
I would have rather walked for these last 5 years.

I have replaced:

*The brakes (4 times, front and back)

*The ignition switch (twice)

*Raditator (twice)

*Front driver and passenger windows (the leaked)

*The dash board (which cracked the 3rd day I had the car)

*Airbag (both driver and passenger side - they deployed due to bad wiring by the manufacturer thankfully when no one was in the car)

*Starter (twice)

*Transmission (only once, after getting stranding over 1300 miles away from home)
</b>
These seems like a lot of garbage, but it isn't. In fact, the only thing that is garbage in this horror story is the vehicle itself. In fact, I seen another review speaking about the security of this car.<b> There is none.</b> I dont want to boast ways to break into a car here, but, with the Neon, you grab a normal clothes hanger, straighten it leaving a 2-inch loop at the end and slide it between the window and door frame. You simply push the hanger forward and use the loop to grasp the door handle which is appropriately facing in the direction opposite of you. Pull back once and you now have yourself the world's most troublesome car. <b>Congradulations.</b>

And if anyone wants to use this article as advice or as a &quot;tip&quot; to steal one. Don't be stupid, you'll have to call for a ride home because this car wont make it.

&quot;Why didn't you take it back&quot;? you ask. Well, <b>Dodge are the most unproductive customer care facility that I have ever dealt with.</b> I have contacted them more than <b>30</b> times and only gotten called back <b>two times in 5 years.</b> They say my file and claim is being &quot;reviewed&quot;.

But now after 5 years and sinking more than a few thousand into the car they contact me (by letter, cowards) and tell me that because of the time frame that has passed between the time of purchase and now that nothing can be done as for a replacement. What a load.

I currently have filed suit against Dodge for the car to be replaced and for myself to be reimbursed for all charges in repair.

I will update this review when the next step is taken.

Thank you for listening !!
