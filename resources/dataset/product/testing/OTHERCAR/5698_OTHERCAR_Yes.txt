            When forced into a car search in September of last year, we came across a car that we originally had no opinion of but quite frankly fell in love with once we took it for a spin.

First of all, the equipment:  1998 Nissan Altima GXE, 5-speed, 4-door, sunroof, stereo with cassette and CD player, cruise control, tilt steering, remote keyless entry and factory alarm system.

We bought the car from the nice folks at 1400 Motors in Nashua NH, who made the car-buying procedure as painless as it ever has been.  The first time we took it for a test drive, we were impressed by several features.  The pickup and handling on the car was excellent.  It seemed a lot more peppy than it had looked when we looked it over.  The interior was plain but comfortable, with a great deal of back seat room for our daughter, who loves to travel heavy whether we're going on a road trip or to the corner store.  The back seat features a 60/40 split so you can fold down one or both seats for extra trunk room.  The trunk is pretty capacious to begin with, however, and we rarely need to make use of this feature.  We loved the keyless entry, it's a bonus that we've never had on a car before.  We wish they had added a trunk release to the remote, for those times when your hands are about to give out and you don't want to fish in your pocket for your keys.  The sunroof is a great touch in the warm months, as well.

The main thing that I personally love about the car, however, is that it is just plain fun to drive.  It has a lot of torque on the bottom end, and a couple of times when I'm a little fast off the clutch I end up burning rubber from a standing position.  The engine has a lot of power for it's size, and you can take it well beyond legal limits (not that you would want to) without it complaining.  It corners well, and the steering is very responsive too.  The cruise control is very gentle, even on hills, and doesn't accelerate or decelerate jerkily.  All controls are easy to reach from the driver's position.  The factory stereo packs a pretty good punch, and has many controls without being too complicated.  I like the fact that you can shut the stereo off in two ways, either by pushing the volume knob it or by double-pressing one of the component select switches.

The only drawback that I can think of at this point is that the ride seems a little jerky, but I suspect part of that has to do with the awful condition of the roads around here.  The car still corners and responds well, so I don't think ride is that big of a concern.

I'm surprised how little I have heard about this car.  It is a great value for the money, is a lot of fun to drive, and comes with a lot of great features in a solidly built car.  I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a great car without the expense of some of the other imports.<br><br>
