            Summary - good deal if you shop smart and know what you are getting

I &quot;accidentally&quot; purchased my used '95 Lebaron GTC Convertible when I stopped by a Chrysler dealer to &quot;get some information&quot; on the car. Pretty soon I was suckered by a junior salesman who suggested I could get this car (the best one of the used LeBarons on the lot) for a rediculous price. Sure you laugh now, but I bought it and 3 hours later, I had myself a car (for a bit more than he said, but still it was the legitimate WHOLESALE bluebook). I also bought the FULL warranty. Sucker you may think, but it was worth it.

Two days into the car, the convertible top froze in the open position and even in California it started to get cold. Luckily the full warranty completely covered it (they tried to scam me the first time and then they ended up fixing it). I think it cost them $600 or so (about 1/2 my total 2 year warranty bill).

I have had some sort of transmission or similar problem, but generally this has been fixed by adding one of those $3 additive/degreasers every 5,000 miles or so. There was also what seemed like a bit of slippage, but the cleaner stuff seemed to clean it up.

The engine is pretty powerful for such a small/light car and I have no problem even though I am an agressive driver on busy california freeways. There is somewhat of a sway at high speeds, but that is due to the frame.

The body is fairly strong, considering the year, but it is nothing like the '72 Pontiac I first learned to drive in (the rolling boat :-) ). It will take moderate abuse although the plastic trim and bumpers behave as plastic items normally do (they scrape and bend a lot).

Bottom line - These cars devalue very quickly so you can get them cheap while they still have a lot of miles in them. Be aware of the defects in various model years ('95 was pretty good, but '94 had some problems) and use the NTSB website to check recalls and a service like CARFAX to check the title (They said it was owned by an older couple and when I checked the title it turned out to be a rental [but still had little mileage] so unless they were Mr. and Mrs. Avis I was lied too... oh well. That is why you buy a warranty)

Update - 5/18/2000 - Car is destroyed. Unfortunately, the K-car frame and the fiberglass body can't stand up to an under 30 mph crash. Just front end damage totalled well over $10,000 and far exceed the 8,000 value of the car... oh well. But I would still buy another<br><br>
