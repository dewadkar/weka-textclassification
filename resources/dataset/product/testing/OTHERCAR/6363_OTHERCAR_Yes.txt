            Whoever,
       I purchased a new 2000 Monte-Carlo LS. I purchased the first black one in my area, so far I enjoy the car throughly,it is a very quiet car, you do not hear the motor or exhaust noise,it almost sounds like an electric car. Ihad a Caprice before this so I have an idea to what a quiet car sounds like. I only have 225 miles on this car.If I have any complaints I will inform you.<br><br>
