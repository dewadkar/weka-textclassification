            Summer is a special time.  Summer took on that special quality to most people when they were kids and they first learned that there is no school for 3 months in a row.  What could be more special than that? I vividly recall the warm summer nights I spent in Sacramento, California as a child.  The summer days are downright HOT, but when the sun went down, the temperature would cool to a balmy 65 or 70 degrees � and since it�s summer, you�re allowed to stay out a little later than usual. Nothing could ever match the exhilaration of zipping down the newly paved streets of my little suburban neighborhood racing from the glow of one street light to the next, at what I thought were excessive speeds on a Schwinn Sting-Ray or a  Huffy Sizzler.  I�ve often tried to recapture those times, but with little success. The closest I�ve come is driving a convertible, top down, through the middle of those warm, dark nights.

OK, reality check! Los Angeles is a far cry from my small suburban town, and no car could ever match the thrill and excitement of your first bicycle.  However, no matter what city you live in, a convertible on a warm summer night is hard to beat.  I�m smiling just thinking about it.  As convertibles go, you could do worse than the Eclipse Spyder.  The Eclipse Spyder offer tough competition for the Miata, Mustang V-6, and possible the decidedly un-sporty Solara convertible.

If you are shopping for an Eclipse Spyder, you must get the GT with the 200 hp V-6, and a 5-speed.  For comparison sake, the mid-size Toyota Camry has a 3.0 liter V-6, and makes about the same amount of power as the V-6 in the Eclipse Spyder GT.  Imagine what fun it would be to have a 200 hp V-6 under the hood of a car just slightly larger than a Mazda Miata.  The Mitsubishi�s power comes on strong at low rpms and pulls all the way to redline.  The 5-speed manual transmission only adds to fun � this car is a blast to drive fast.  Thankfully the gear ratios are such that city driving is not such a huge chore as it can be in some manual transmission cars (Pontiac Firebird). Another pleasant surprise in the GT Spyder, is the wonderful exhaust note � it purrs.  Spirited driving, and high revs only make the engine sound sweeter.  The Miata has a nice sounding exhaust note as well, but there is no mistaking the sound of big V-6.

While the ride is very compliant for a sporty car, handling is where the Eclipse falls short.  While the Miata succeeds in its attempt to define the budget sports car segment, the Eclipse fails in its attempt to be both a comfortable tourer as well as a sports car.  

Here is the bottom line: on a long trip or everyday driving the Eclipse has the feel of a bigger car � it�s just more civilized.  On twisty canyon roads and narrow country lanes, the Miata is just more fun, it�s stiffer, is rear wheel drive and handles much better. The Eclipse is front wheel drive, if you don�t know the difference by now, it won�t matter to you, enthusiasts will probably prefer the Miata.  

To the credit of Mitsubishi, they have made the Eclipse Spyder sporty enough, while still offering adequate trunk space, passenger volume, and interior storage space. This is something the Miata simply cannot provide. Think of the Miata as a great second car, while the Eclipse could easily handle the job of being your ONLY car.  If you like the power, reliability and comfort of the Solara, but you�re under 50, stick with the Eclipse. The Solara�s Camry based suspension is too soft to be fun. And  let�s face, when is the last time you saw anyone under 55 driving a Solara?  OK, maybe that one time you had to borrow your parents car, but other than that?   Solara = old, Eclipse = young.

The Eclipse�s sporty theme is carried through to the interior of the car, with a cool looking pod just above the stereo that displays the time, and all radio/stereo information.  Separate round gauges house the fuel level and temperature indicators and the three spoke steering wheel retains the sporty look/feel of the overall car. While there are rear seats, you�d be hard pressed to use them for anything other than hauling small kids or some cargo.  Again, this is a distinct advantage over the sportier Miata which barely has enough room for a purse and wallet when driving with a companion.  The Eclipse GT Spyder has a power top, which is an unexpected surprise in a car this size.  With the flip of a switch, all windows power down, and the top folds nicely behind the rear seats. Some trunk space is sacrificed when compared to the Eclipse coupe, but it is still more spacious than the Mazda Miata.  

The Eclipse�s seats are comfortable enough, but could offer a little more support.  Also,  for a fully loaded Eclipse Spyder GT the price can top $27,000. For that price, the leather on the seats should be a little higher quality, and front seats should offer lumbar adjustments.  Also, the Infinity stereo lacks the sound quality one would expect from a premium brand.  Perhaps a car with an open top is not the ideal setting for audiophiles.

Overall the Eclipse Spyder is a wonderfully performing car that is both fun to drive and useful.  While the styling may turn some older shoppers away, anyone under 35 will most likely appreciate the unique statement the boldly styled Eclipse makes.  Add all this to the fact that Mitsubishi cars and trucks come with a 5/60,0000 mile power train warranty plus the usual 3/36 bumper to bumper coverage and it�s easy to move the Eclipse to the top of your shopping list.
