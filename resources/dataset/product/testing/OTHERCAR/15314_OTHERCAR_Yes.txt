            The decision to buy this camera was not an easy one. That is not to say that there is anything wrong with this product, in fact, just the opposite is true. But you have to admit with a price tag of $500.00-$600.00 you have to check things out first!

 I was first turned onto this product because the company that I work for purchased one. I was amazed at the quality of the pictures and the resolution. In fact when I saw the pictures, even though it was on my computer screen, I couldn't believe that this came from a digital camera. The picture looked as clear as a 35mm picture.

 The features on this camera are wonderful. This thing will do just about whatever you want, even a professional could use this product. I have used the camera for many different things. I have used it to list items on auction sites, and I have seen a lot of pictures that are on some of the auctions and very few have the quality of the pictures that come from this camera. I have used it for family pictures, and it is great to be able to send quality pictures to your relatives that are far away.

 With a good quality printer and high glossy photo paper, this camera will take pictures that I would hang on my wall next to professionally taken pictures. In fact I have a picture, that I have taken of my daughter, hanging on my wall at work, that I have received many comments about how good it looks. When I tell people that it came from a digital camera and a printer that isn't even top quality, they can't believe it. 

This product has so many options that I can't even list them all. The zoom is great, the mpeg movies that you can take are very cool, and best off all the battery lasts for quite a while and of course it is rechargeable. The fact that this camera uses floppy disks for the pictures is an obvious selling point. What can be better than taking pictures and being able to view them by just popping a disk in the drive of virtually any computer.

 If you have the cash to spend on a camera, you won't be disappointed with this one! You might even just throw your 35mm out for good with this baby!!<br><br>
