            I had looked at the new C-Class several times at car shows in Kansas City and read a lot about them, but never really thought I would actually own one.  Having turned in a lease, I was looking for another car. I was not satisfied with the sluggish performance of my front-wheel drive car, nor were it's poor road manners to talk about.  So I found myself in the showroom, looking at the C-Class.  I test drove a C-280 and found all the performance, handling, and solid build quality I had been missing in the non-German cars I had been driving.  We leased a 1998 C-280.  What an amazing car!  The SOHC three-valve 2.8L V-6 serves up 195hp effortlessly. The transmission is a five-speed automatic and, as a result, even though there's a V-6 up front, it will move off the line with spirit.  The total package of the C-Class is a real find, for the money invested.  The fit and finish of my car has been perfect.  The dealer made short work of a faulty gas gauge, and later a turn-signal problem (they just replaced the whole assembly!)  One of the real technical treats is the windshield wiper system. It is a single arm which moves on a cam as it sweeps the windshield, covering more territory than any two-armed car I've driven in the past.  The wiper delay system senses moisture on the windshield so the arm doesn't sweep until there's something to remove.  We typically leave the system on and when it rains, the wiper will go from parked to full, non-stop wiping back to parked if the rain quits.  Amazing! And that's just the windshield wiper!.  The automatic temperature control is excellent.  Select a temperature, and basically, forget it. Leaving the car for a trip into a store?  Push the &quot;Rest&quot; button and the car will maintain 72 degrees for up to thirty minutes by circulating coolant through the heater.  The system automatically shuts down if battery voltage drops below 11 volts, or more than thirty minutes elapse.  The headlight switch allows the activation of right or left park lights at night so, depending upon which side of the street you chose, the outside park lights can warn motorists of your presence.  On the interstate, the car is mostly unflappable.  There is a little tendency to wander in crosswinds, but control is easy.  We took a road trip from K.C.to Indianapolis with four on board.  The car averaged about 29mpg at a steady 70 to 80 (oops!)miles per hour.  This is a car that just begs to be driven long distances.  It handles the road conditions so well that it makes me look like a better driver than I really am.  The only sore point has been the tires.  Continental CH-95's came from the factory. These tires acted as if they were hexagonal by 25,000 miles, and finally I replaced them at 28,000 miles with Michelin XGTH4 Pilots.  Wow, what a difference that made. Mercedes Benz wanted no part of the tire issue, even though I had taken the car in twice for vibration problems and road noise (which ultimately turned out to be the tire problem).  I can live with that. The tires made this car even better.  The car now has nearly 32,000 miles on it, and there has been no need for service, except oil changes and M-B service (which was handled by my lease terms). So, except for the premature failure of tires, this car is a screaming success for my quest to find a better automobile.  Oh yes, even though it is a rear wheel dirver, the traction control helps immensely in the snow or on wet pavement.  The car turns very short, something my front drive cars never did, and basically just seems at home in any situation the road throws at me.  If you're looking at a new small car, after you have looked at Honda and Acura, go drive a C-Class.  Look at the resale value, and what that does for a lease, and then you'll see the real beauty of this little beast.  This has got to be one of the best kept secrets of the automotive world.<br><br>
