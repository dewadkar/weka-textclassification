            I had never owned a new vehicle before as I always had someone around that could take care of repairs for me. However when I moved to the US I needed a reliable car and with my total lack of car knowledge and/or availability of people to help me I decided I had better buy a new one.

I really only considered the Sentra and the Civic - the Sentra was highly favored because I had rented one once and fell in love with the way it handled and I felt it looked better than most of the economy sub-compacts. I also considered a Nissan as my sister had bought one years ago and had very few problems with it until she finally sold it 10 years later.

Even tho reviews say the Sentra is very boring to look at I feel it's sleek and nice looking - especially for a small car. I did hate the way it looked on the back end so added a spoiler which dramatically improved the appearance in my opinion.  I felt the interior of the car defied the fact that it is an economy car as compared to the Civic. I feel it almost has a luxury feel and is a VERY good value for the money.

The car handles well, especially considering the fact that it only uses a 4 liter engine. Gas mileage is great.

About the only thing I really dislike about the vehicle is the relative lack of comfort for long journeys. Also, I wouldn't want to have to be a back seat passenger for any length of time!

The car has had zero problems other than a lock that tends to occasionally stick. When i've visited the dealer for maintenance I've been more than pleased. The service department - more than any other reason is why I'll likely buy another Nissan.
