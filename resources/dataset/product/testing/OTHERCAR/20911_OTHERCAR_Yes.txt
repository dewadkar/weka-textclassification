            I am quite fond of the unique styling of this vehicle.  I had an extensive test drive and here are my thoughts:

The car seems extremely well made albeit it is a Chrysler.  I've owned three Chrysler products in the past four years and have had a few quality problems.  The biggest problem was my Chrysler Sebring Coupe which had a transmission failure at 12,000 miles.  I am still weary of Chrylser reliability as evidenced by epinions and Consumer Reports. Anyway...baclk to my review.  The doors close with a nice thunk and there were no squeaks or rattles on the smooth roads I drove on.  The engine noise seems to be quieter than the Dodge Stratus I test drove two years ago.  The engine still lacks refinement and it was not enjoyable at higher RPM's.  

The handling was decent for what I would call a tall car.  I guess you could say it felt like a tall Neon.  The acceleration was adequate but onramp manuevers during rush hour can be tricky.  I realize a V6 would be impossible based on the configuration but a supercharger would be nice.

The really cool thing I liked was the way you can remove the seats.  Unfortunately, if you are going on a long trip and have a lot of stuff to haul, you're stuck with just a two seater (unless someone lies down in the back).  

The fit and finish was way above average for Chrysler products of the past years.  It is amazing how they can produce such a fine piece of machinery for the MSRP.  I truly hope this car holds up over the years. 

Dislikes were few but they should really rethink the location of the window lift buttons.  Nice idea to have them on the dash but quite inconvenient. I also think it would be nice if the rear window would lower in the liftgate but I guess the design would have to be modified.  

Overall, I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone tired of the SUV craze.   This car is only going to get better over the years as AWD and more power will become a reality.  I get disgusted when I hear people are paying $5,000 over list for what merely amounts to a Neon with a different suit.  I am certain that within 18 months the supply problem will be a thing of the past.  Remember the Miata and the VW New Beetle?  You can buy them for UNDER list now.   I just can imagine when there will be hundreds of thousands of PT Cruisers on the road.  Their will no longer be that unique feeling and people who overpaid may feel miserable.  But in retrospect, those who overpaid are reaping the benefits now of having something that EVERYONE wants.  Let's cross our fingers and hope that reliability with this beauty will not be a problem.
