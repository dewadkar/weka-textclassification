            My mom recently started to search the car market after our '95 Chevy Astro started to get unreliable. One thing you should know is that I&#146m a 16-year-old guy. From the time my mom started looking, I was pushing for the nice little Subaru Loyale sedan that she had her eye on. It was small, it looked great, and it was fast. It would have been a dream if we'd been able to get it. But then the more my mom thought about it, the more she realized a car wouldn't work for us. We have to fit the four of us, my mom, my two brothers, and I, and all our stuff. That wouldn't work if we had a car since we're all avid skiers. My mom decided we needed to get another van. At first I was a little bugged, I really wanted that nice little car, but after I drove the Montana, my opinion completely changed. The Montana is a great little van. The on we got had the four captain&#146s chairs (those big ones from the front) that meant that it had two seats in the middle instead of the usual bench. This was definitely nicer. Means more room, and when it's just the four of us we can travel very comfortably. It&#146s also the extended edition, which means it has a little longer wheelbase, which I wouldn't go without. When the driver has their seat in the right position, the middle seats don't have much leg room, so they have to push all the way back, and then the back seat has to go all the way back too, and it would be very uncomfortable if there wasn't the room to move the seats back. As soon as I sat in it I knew I liked it. The set up of the console is perfect, with everything where it should be. It also has a little switch that shuts all the inside lights off no matter what, which is really useful. I didn't truly come to love it though until I took it on the road. It drives like a car. It has a nice, smooth ride, stable around the corners, and quick coming out of them. I thought that after the old beast of a van that we used to have, going down to one of these little tiny vans would mean that it would be slow, and bad to drive. I couldn't have been more wrong. The little Montana, with it's 3.4 v6 is quicker that the old Astro, with it's 4.3 v6. That&#146s a huge difference in engine size, and I thought the size wouldn't make up for it. I guess size really does matter! The biggest downside to the van that I&#146ve noticed so far is the small interior. Part of that is probably the fact that I was spoiled by the Astro, with it's massive interior. It still seems small though, it's hard to move from the front to the back seats, and a person can't even lie down across the back seat. The seats do recline allot, but it just doesn't work as well as a nice big bench. Oh! Two more things I almost forgot. We decided to go with the DVD player, and it was definitely worth it, we're a family that spends a lot of time on the road, and it makes road trips a lot easier. The final thing is the fuel efficiency. After the Astro, anything would be better, but this thing is great on gas! In the Astro we were spending 200 or more a week on gas, and now we're down around 100. Huge savings there. As weird as it is for me to say this, I&#146m a 16-year-old guy that's recommending this van to anyone. It&#146s got a great balance of performance and space.
