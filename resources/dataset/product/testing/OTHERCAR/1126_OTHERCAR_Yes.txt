            I bought a 2000 Dodge Neon back in June. I must say, I didn't like the Neon's when they first came out. They were (and still are) a compact car, but they *looked* like a compact car.  The 2000's came out a bit sportier and not so cheapish looking. My poor old Taurus finally kicked the bucket and left me with the problem of deciding on a new car.  At first glance, I thought the Neon was an Intrepid or such, till I really looked at it. It's quite roomy and excellent on gas. I've driven mine 5000 miles already and not a glitch. (Yes I travel a lot in the summer time!)
Dodge/Chrysler has impressed me with it.  When you drive it, it doesn't have the feel of a compact car. (Trust me, I had a chevette at one time.. now THERE is a compact car!)  It handles extremely well in all summer type weather. I haven't had a chance for driving in snow yet, but that is rapidly approaching and I'm anxious to see how well it will handle in that.  The only thing I have found that I DON'T like about them is the lack of room for things in it. I.E. my C.B. radio etc. I had to create a space for it. (mounted on the dash with velcro!) All in all though, I am very pleased with my purchase. It has lots of *pep* and will pass gas stations! LOL!<br><br>
