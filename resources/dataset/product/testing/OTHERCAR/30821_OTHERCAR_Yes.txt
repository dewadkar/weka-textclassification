            I have been very satisfied with my Olympus D-340R Digital Camera. I have used it extensively since May 1999 and have experienced no problems. My camera has taken thousands of pictures since May and has shown to be a real workhorse. I have never had a picture not come out because the camera failed. 

The ease of use makes this an extremely attractive camera for even novice users. Auto-focus makes using this camera a snap. Truly a point and shoot. 

The pictures that this camera produces are of good quality for the average person. The portrait shots come out quite well but are usually a little dark. This is easily corrected in the provided software or any picture editing software. The macro shots are of excellent quality. I would expect cameras that cost 3 times as much to produce this kind of quality. 

A must for this camera is the 4 pack of Ni-Mh Batteries and charger from Olympus. The camera is power hungry, especially if the LCD view finder/picture viewer is in constant use. (The view finder is excellent). If this camera is going to be heavily used inside near an electrical power source, it might be a good idea to get the AC adaptor too. 

The only negative I have found is that there are a lot of small, multiple use buttons that tend to be confusing. After a bit of experience you will figure out what they all do and only use the ones you need. 

Shop the internet for good deals on this item. When purchased I saved close to $100 over the cost of buying it locally. Buy this item if you are looking for above average photos from a hard working camera for a very reasonable price. 


Excellent LCD View Finder, Good Quality Pictures, Inexpensive.
