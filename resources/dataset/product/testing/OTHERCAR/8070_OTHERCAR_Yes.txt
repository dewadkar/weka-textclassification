            This is a fantastic multi functional vehicle with the capacity of taking large anounts of cargo, passengers or a combination of both.  We bought our 1996 Quest while touring in Hawaii and it is 2000 now and it is still going strong. We had one major problem and had to have a new engine (due to a factory recall, thankfully no money out of our pocket!(.  
  We have driven from Maine to Virginia and back numerous times in the Quest and have never been uncomfortable. Let me tell you what all we had in the van the first trip: 2 huge suitcases, 2 huge dogs, a newborn with all the newborn things to go with one, pillows, blankets and 2 folded dog kennels.  We left the middle seat at home so that we could have extra room and boy did it come in handy. 
  Would recommend to Quest to any large or small family. We bought ours before we were even pregnant. great investment!<br><br>
