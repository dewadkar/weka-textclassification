            My main problem with the QV-5000SX is speed. It takes about 15 seconds from power-up until it's ready to take a picture. So, it's no good for those spontaneous shots. When it takes so long to take a shot, you don't want to turn the camera off, since you're afraid of missing something.

It also takes 11 seconds to take and store a shot at the highest resolution. The image quality is, however, excellent.

Another area which shows the slow speed is on transferring image - it can take about 30-40 minutes to transfer all your pictures to the PC, since it only uses a RS-232 serial cable. The serial cable is very unreliable too. Sometimes the PC just cannot connect to the camera, no matter how much you try to fiddle with the cable. I think USB-capable cameras will alleviate much of this problem, but we'll see.

The camera can store a lot of images - but I still wish it would allow you to insert smartmedia cards, and other removable media.

The digital zoom (4x) is pretty worthless - very poor image quality.

The camera has a facility to take mini-movies, about 160x100 resolution and 6 seconds long - these are really cool. You can make animated gifs using a supplied program, and put them on your web page.
