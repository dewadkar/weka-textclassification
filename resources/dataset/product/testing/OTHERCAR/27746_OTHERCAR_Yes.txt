            Well, since i used epinions a source for my decision for getting this camera, i will skip all the specs and info on the camera and dive straight to what my experiences of it were since i'm sure all of you will read other opinions other than mines. 

SIZE
  First of all, this camera just pushes all the "WOW" buttons for me. Its a great looking camera thats ultra-portable, but you also have to remember that you are paying for its extreme portablility in its high price tag. Its a bit larger than a credit card, more like the size and width of a three-fold guy's wallet and its about as heavy as a nokia 6190 phone(if you have one). 

IMAGE QUALITY
   For a 2.1 megapixel camera thats this small, this camera takes fairly decent pictures. No complaints from me. An image in super fine resolution blows up to an 8x10 with the same sharpness as if it were a 4x6. I did a little experiment the first day i bought the camera and that was to see the difference for myself of the three different file qualities. I suggest you do the same too since everyone's idea of acceptable quality is different.
    Anyways, i took 3 different pictures, one during the day, one at night, and one in macro mode(upclose) and my opinion is....for most of your 4x6 and 5x7 pictures, the FINE resolution will be sufficient. 


FEATURES
    I'm sure that you've all heard this before, but not give a rat's @$$ about DIGITAL ZOOM. All it does is zoom in on the picture at the expense of your quality. If you wanted to zoom in or basically crop and enlarge, use photoshop. What you're interested in is optical zoom and this camera has 2x, which is decent but in my opinion, not enough for the 450 i shelled out. 
     One grip i have about the camera is that the viewfinder does not take the exact picture you shoot, a problem that affects most digital and 35mm point and shoot cameras. Another thing is that like other digital cameras, i has some difficulty taking pictures in the dark. Some pictures come out dark.

OTHER STUFF
    You'll definitely want to upgrade your camera right out of the box because the 8MB card holds squat. At superfine, it will hold 4 pictures while at FINE, it holds approx. 10 pictures. I bought a LEXAR 4x 64 MB card right away. By the way, Lexar's cards are great. They're not THAT cheap and they're very fast. You won't have to wait as long for the picture to save. You can pick them up for around 80. I bought mines on ebay for 50. Just don't bid against me...be kind to those that give you advice!
     Another thing you definitely will want to get is another battery. MAKE SURE YOU PURCHASE THE CAMERA WITH THE CHARGER AND BATTERY INCLUDED. Older stocks do not come with charger or NiMH batteries. Separately, those are almost 100. The batteries drain quickly, around 40 superfine shots w/ LCD on for me. However, most of the time you'll want to take pictures without the LCD on, it better that ways anyways. A spare battery is around 40 dollars and is a must. A case is optional, but since you spend upwards of 400 on this baby, you might as well spend 10 bucks more. 
     By the way, don't don't overspend, you can get great deals on the internet. Ebay is a great place but not always the best place. I bought the battery, neckstrap and case combo for 51 on ebay. I've seen it for 54 on sites. DON"T PAY MORE!!! 
      Hmm, what else to say...the camera is great. You'll love it! Hope my review and opinion is helpful to you all. By the way, for that one negative review that this camera recieved, the person obviously didn't know what he/she was talking about. First of all, the camera does not take THAT long to take a picture. From the time you push the shutter to the actual picture takes about 1 sec. HOWEVER!!!!! If you prefocus the shot, the picture is taken almost instantly. This is true for ALL point and shoot DIGITAL CAMERAS since the camera has to autofocus and auto expose and auto white balance. I mean, how long does a kiss take? If the guy had half an @$$ for a brain, he would have had the camera ready to shoot. The shot would have been fine. I don't think problems that plague ALL digital cameras should count as a negative for this camera...even more since the lag is fairly short for this camera. My thoughts are,he probably had the camera still in his shirt pocket.
