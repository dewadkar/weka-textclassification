My dad recently bought a brand new GMC Suburban,  DON'T ASK ME WHY WE DIDN&quot;T GET A CHEVY! Sike, there really is no difference between the two maybe minor specification differences buy.  Basically when your trying to decide it depends if you like GMC or Chevy.  I helped my dad select our Suburban because this babey is so vesitile.
When we bought our Suburban we got the 5.7 liter half ton, because my dad was worried about gas consumptions.
Ok let me paint the picture of our Suburban   Color: White
                                                                Interior: Tan Leather
                                                                Tinted Windows: of course
                                                                Model: SLT
                                                                Trans:  Auto  (That was a mistake, in my opinion because since then we have added many after market items to the car including a brush bar, sway-bars(not sure if they are stock)2-inch lift, fog lights, and now.  Me personally I think that thing needs exhaust,  If you haven't heard a Suburban with Exhaust let me tell you it sounds like a giant beat. There are also K &amp;N Air-Filters availble , Chips , Superchargers and so much more and the automatic will not push to the potential of the engine.  Still I think those modififaciton would be fine even without manual trans.  Other thatn all these that i have listed,  Lift kits, Lowering kits,  with new advances in suspension and shocks you can turn that moster into a low rider or put it in the sky like a moster truck,  Then comes a wide variety of off road tires like Dick Cepik (i think i spelled that right) and Michelin low profile tires for you Low Rider.    BUTTTTTTTTT WAAAIITTTTT.
   Still,  if you travel into your nearest audio and electronic store they have t.v's, vcrs, DVD , nintendo, playstation all yo fit perfectly in your Suburban Like if you read Dupont Regency some of those Suburbans.  Still the Suburban would make a great bass Vehicle. You can add Plenty of subs and amps, with a lot of room in the back for personalized install.
    we have not done most of these to the Suburban because of two reasons
    We would need a lot of money to get all this stuff high quality
    It's just a car my dad will probaly buy a new one in six months

But if you want a car that you can do anything to choose the Suburban,
A luxury vehicle with any potential you can imagine<br><br>
