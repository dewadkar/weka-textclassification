            Excellent looking SUV small enough to be easy to drive, turn, park, etc...  Plus it is tough as can be!  We have a 1999 4runner and it has required little maintenance and is as dependable as can be.  Decent miles per gallon (20's).   The V6 has plenty of power for the mountains and the 4 wheel drive is fairly easy to shift into at highway speed.  The interior is not like a Yukon or something but we still manage to carry a lot of gear.  Be sure and get the roof racks for xtra gear.  The cruise control is a must have.  Easy to drive, easy to maintain, very versatile and fun!!!<br><br>
