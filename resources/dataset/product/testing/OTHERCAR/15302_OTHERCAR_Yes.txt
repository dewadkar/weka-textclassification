            The FD83 was my second foray into digital photography.  I originally resisted the Mavica line because of the floppy disk feature; it seemed trite, unsophisticated, and embracing old technology.  However, when my younger brother bought the FD73, I was overwhelmed with it's ease of use.  My Yashica Samurai presented a real hassle getting my images to my PC and it ate batteries like crazy.  On the other hand, the Mavica writes to a simple floppy and comes equipped with a rechargeable battery that lasts a long time.  So why did I choose the FD83?  I had to have a better camera than my brother, of course!  All kidding aside, I wanted the faster disk access (4x on the FD83 versus 2x on the FD73) and I also wanted the option of using the memory stick instead of the floppy.

What do I hate about the FD83?  Hate is too strong a word; I don't hate anything about this camera.  The camera is bulky to accommodate the disk drive.  That also translates to being a bit heavy.  So what?!  I miss the optical viewfinder.  I've used SLR cameras for so long, it is just a habit that is tough to break.  You sacrifice a little zoom capability between the FD73 (10x) versus the FD83 (6x).

What do I love about the FD83?  It is sooooo easy.  Floppy in, floppy out.  No cables, just inexpensive floppies.  The FD83 also shoots 6 second video with sound.  6 seconds doesn't sound like much but it is a super cool feature.  Sound bite size with video!  Oh yeah, it takes great pictures!

Is the FD83 for you?  If you want easy, the Mavica line is it.  Hey, my little brother figured out how to use it (FD73) on his own.  Believe me, that says it all.  If you don't mind paying just a little more (than the FD73 and you're not daunted by the additional bulk and weight), you will be happy with this camera. Actually I bought mine new on eBay and paid the same as my brother paid at the store.  If faster disk access is important, get the FD83.  If zoom is not so important, get the FD83.  If you want that nice extra of 6 second video, get the FD83.

And if you outgrow this camera because you want the latest and greatest, resale is excellent.  Or you can be a real hero by passing it on to family or a friend.<br><br>
