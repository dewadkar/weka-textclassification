            After a unfortunate loss of my DSC-P9 (stolen while I was deployed in the middle east during the war), I was looking for a replacement.  Originally my idea was to get another P9 as I was happy with its performance and the ability to take over 700 images (fine quality at 640X480 on a 128MB memory stick).  

While in Japan on a deployment, I looked for a replacement camera and found that the P9 was replaced with the P92.  The only initial difference I found in it from the 92 was it was 5.0 megapixels as compared to 4.0. Both the P9 and P92 have a 3X optical and 3x digital zoom. And the price was comparable to what I paid for the P9. (Mine was purchased at a base exchange).  

Upon first setup and use I again found it very similar, except I found some pleasing upgrades.  First, there were several more settings for environments.  There are settings for outdoors, high light, low light, low light portraits and a custom setting selection that allows you to go and set the ISO speeds, etc.  I found the navigation through the on screen menus just as easy as with the P9 in typical Sony fashion. The quality of the images is impeccable even for the most discriminating amateur photographer.  

Sony had made some noticeable hardware changes that were nice as well.  Instead of the old rechargable battery that the P9 had, the 92 uses 2 AA batteries (rechargable NiMH which are included).  This is a great improvement from having to purchase an additional proprietary battery, instead once the batteries run out of juice, finding alkaline replacements in a pinch is a reality.  The other great improvement is the number of great accessories available for this camera.  I also purchased the adapter body that allows you to use additional 30mm lenses, a wide angle, and telephoto.  Sony also makes a marine pack for the P9 series camera for a few hundred dollars for the avid scuba diver types. 

So far I have taken over 500 photos on this camera and I can say that although the price was a little steeper than others, it so far has lived up to being a suitable replacement to the P9.  In the future I would definitely like to see implementation of the infrared technology that Sony has on many of its DV cams for low/no light conditions.  This would be a fantastic feature that would only add value and function to an already great camera.
