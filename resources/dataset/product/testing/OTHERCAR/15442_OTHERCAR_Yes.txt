            I love my Sony Mavica camera more than I can express in words.  I have taken more than 3,000 photos with mine and the quality is excellent.  I HATED traditional film cameras and all of the associated hassles of getting film developed, finding your favorite shots to be too dark or out of focus, etc.

The Sony Mavica is hardly the camera for a professional...but hey, I'm not a professional!  The quality isn't as good as a 35 MM camera, but the cost is but a fraction over the long term.

I also had about 1,000 floppy disks for which I had little use... Now I've got plenty of reason to use them.

The camera comes with a nice software package that allows for editing of photos and storage in albums which are viewable individually or in slide shows.  Pop in a good CD and start the slide show and you've got a fabulous photographic show with interesting transitions from shot to shot...

The rechargeable battery is terrific -- I've NEVER run out of power and because it's a lithium ion battery it can be recharged at any point in the lifecycle without fear of creating that "memory" that shortens the lifespan of ni-cad batteries.

It's very convenient to review shots as you're shooting pictures and taking as many as you need to get the ones you really want while discarding the less-than-perfect images (if you want to discard them.)

I also take great joy in sharing these photos with other people...even total strangers who may happen to be in the picture.

I bought my camera within a month of it's release and paid $700 for it.  I can tell you that it's the best $700 I ever spent.
