            I have had this car for several months.  I can't wait to drive it in the snow, as I have seen one go up an ice covered hill in my neighborhood with no problem.  

I got the Limited Wagon and it comes packed with features, cruise control, rubber tray for the back (useful for wet dogs, wet scuba equipment, garden purchases), leather seats, sunroofs, power windows, bun warmers, windshield and side view heaters, and more that I can't remember.

The dealership experience was reasonably positive - Performance in Chapel Hill, NC.  Got a reasonable deal since it was the last day of the month and quarter.  Got 2 year zero percent financing for much of the price.  

The car has adequate acceleration, good braking, but the handling was not as good as a Passat.  The handling is probably average and like other wagons in its class.  I suspect the AWD degrades the steering response a bit.

The seats are comfortable and adjustable, though I wish the lumbar support would come out a bit more.

The gas mileage is a little lower than I hoped, but that is the price you pay for AWD.  It would be nice if there was a 5 speed automatic, the highway mileage could be better.  Seems to be better than an SUV, but not as good as comparable non-AWD wagons.

The tethers and new child seat hooks are very nice.  I put three seats in - a bit cramped, but it worked.  The fold down seats, sliding trunk cover, and under-floor storage in the back is quite nice.

Rear wiper and washer works well.  (I don't use it much since Rain-X Rules)

The car is rugged and rugged looking.  If you want a sleek German look, then this ain't it.  

The tires are large and I have felt confident in the car's ability to do what I need it to do.

I thought my front windshield washer was broken, but you have to push a button on the stick to make this work.  Pulling the stick back only makes the wipers go.  Not very intuitive given the other cars I have owned.

I will follow up on this review if I encounter an reliability problems - 5K miles is too soon to know.

I have recommended this vehicle to several people.  I didn't realize how many people drive them until I bought one (now I see them everywhere).  

Consumer Reports rates this car as having above average reliability.  This is a key factor in my decision making process.
