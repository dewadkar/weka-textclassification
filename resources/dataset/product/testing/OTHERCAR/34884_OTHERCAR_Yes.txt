            My wife and I drive a van because we have not, not because we want to.  The reason: Three children and a dog. Our first and previous minivan was the 77 Dodge Grand Caravan LE, which we we fairly happy with, but does not come close to the level of satisfaction we receive with the new Odyssey.

We can summarize what makes this a superior vehicle with the following comments:
Fit &amp; Finish: Beautifully built. Both interior and exterior parts and panels fit seamlessly toghether, with a solid feel, unlike the &quot;plastic&quot; and &quot;cardboard&quot; feel of similar components in the Caravan. Even power sliding door work like jeweled movements

Performance: Power is ample and smoothly delivered.  The engine exhibits 
that famous Honda &quot;hum&quot;. Handling is terrific. Until you look behind you you don't even realize you are driving a van. Brakes like a sports car, even under load!

Comfort: Great support with all seats, plenty of space for both passengers and cargo.  The best HVAC for the entire van with vents galore.

Only things we don't like: sound system is just OK and tape player is an option instead of standard.
Transmission Shifter is too long, get in the way of use and viewing of some thing on the dash. <br><br>
