            I bought this camera on ebay. The FD71 model was first sold in '99 and I did not get it until 2002.

First of all I would like to mention how easy this camera is easy to use. The fact that it makes use of  standard floppy diskettes and still provides sufficient  print quality is this camera's strongest atribute. Most of the shots taken with the camera are taken indoors. Get the camera outdoors in bright sunlight, as I have done on the weekends, and the results are astonishing.

To add pictures to my computer all I had to do was insert the floppy diskette on to my computer and save them. You can very easily email pictures to friends, relatives, or just place them on websites. There is no use for cords, or something that connects to your computer, and no software required!

10X Optical zoom is very rare, even on today's models. Credits for that. The ability to use floppies is a "strength" for new users, or people in a hurry like those in real estate, insurance, etc.


The only things that were misleading were the 640 x 480 resolution. Pictures were average in size, but are not good enough. The bulkiness also was not a help, you can't carry it around without the strap around your neck or risk the camera falling out of your hands. The battery life is very limited lasting only 2 hours the most. You won't be able to re-charge the battery if you are on a road trip, or at the theme park unless you had a spare.The flash is extremely powerful, causing anyone without a very dark tan to be "glowing" white if you're closer than 6 feet. The size/weight of the camera is prohibitive to being a camera you can lug around with you all day.

Overall this cam has proven that it is up to the task. I wouldn't recommend it for a professional photographer but it does a good job for the beginner and occasional, casual photographer
