            My wife and i were in the market for a new van. We had a Plymouth Voyager(91 base model) and it worked fine, except for the paint problem. We looked at Edmunds car site and used Consumer reports 99 car issue. We decided that the Toyota Sienna LE was our new van. The negotiating of the price turned out to be the worst thing about this van. Once we found a dealer(in the southeast) that was willing to come down from MSRP we were in business. We have the LE 5 door model with only 2 options, the UN package (tinted glass, keyless remote entry) and the roof rack. We were &quot;forced&quot; to buy the Toyoguard package, because all of the vehicles coming into a 6 state region in the southeast have that package already applied(it's the body undercoating, sealant, and rust proofing package). The car runs very smoothly, it's is very roomy inside, somewhat deceiving when looking at it from the outside. The only problem is a blind spot. The rear view mirror isn't very functional because of the headrests on the seats. Once you get used to that, it's a great car. We paid $25,000, a good deal considering the prices others were offering. This is a great family car. Seats move, fold down, and can be removed. I strongly urge those concerned with safety and reliability to look at this van. For the money (we were looking at Dodge Grand Caravans and Chrysler Town and Country's) this van beats all of the competition hands down.<br><br>
