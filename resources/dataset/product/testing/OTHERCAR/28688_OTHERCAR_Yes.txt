            I bought my 90 Lebaron coupe in 94 when it had 92K KM's on it.  I have since driven it to today, and it now has 305 000KM's on it.  It has the 3.0 mitsubishi v6 and that engine alone has soured me on 'japanese quality'.  I have had to do the heads twice, once because the stem seals gave out, then again because the rings had carboned up so bad from the leaking valve stem seals that they stuck and let major oil by, taking the cat convertor with it.  When the engine runs its great, smooth power and realitvely quite with good freeway milage (city milage sucks).  The transmission is ok, rebuilt once under chryslers 7yr/115km powertrain warranty, and since then trouble free.  The suspension is a little rough, doesn't take bumps too well, and doesn't really handle all that well eiter so im not sure what iacocca was aiming for.  The infinity stereo is great, the seats super comfortable, the breaks are ok, except for the lame azz implementation of rear disc brakes seems not to have been thought through, and the caliper adapter was made of poor quality steel and dents easily from the pads sliding forward and then you end up with wierd sounds.  The a/c worked great till last year and ever since ive been suffering through the poor quality of cooling offered by r134a.  Steering is ok, allthough i had the rack replaced once due to morning sickness (rack very stiff till it warms up).  What else can i say?  the styling is 1st rate, the trunk is big, and oh yeah, too bad the metallic blue paint wasn't applied better so that it didn't fall off so i wouldn't have had to had it repainted two years ago.
