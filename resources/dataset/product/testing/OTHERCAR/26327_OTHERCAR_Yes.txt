            I'm not the station wagon type.  When my Volvo sputtered and gasped its last breath last year, I was left without a car, and a burning need for one.  I live in Southeastern Virginia, where the public transportation system is a joke.  I am a college student and employed full time.  I needed a car and fast.  I actually ended up with a Mazda 323, but there were so many problems with it that I exchanged it for the Camry.  

When I first saw my white station wagon sitting there on the lot, I knew I was going to buy it.  I am a single 24 year old female without children, and the very mention of the words &quot;station wagon&quot; brought pictures of overworked soccer moms to mind.  My Camry is amazingly compact, yet roomy on the inside.  It has power brakes, power steering, power windows, power locks.  It came equipped with a tape player (which I promptly plugged a cd player into) and plush blue interior.  The car test drove fabulously.  It's comfortable to ride in and after a year, I can say I'm a proud station wagon owner.  I LOVE my car.  That hatchback comes in very handy, much more so than I would have guessed. It holds dozens of shopping bags and luggage for trips.  It even has a tarp you can pull down over your stuff so no one can see it.  

The Camry is Toyota's flagship model, and even the 1991 version is wonderful.  I have had the Camry for over a year now, with no major problems.  I have kept up with the required maintenance.  However, there is an inexplicable short in the display panel for thermostat control.  I just tap it until it comes on.  Not that big a deal.  The air conditioning and heat kick out without fail.  The car is quiet.

This is an excellent first car for individuals stepping out on their own.  It's not boxy like other station wagon.  It doesn't scream &quot;tired, married soccer mom with 3 kids&quot;.  However, if you ARE a soccer mom with three kids, you may want a bigger wagon.  This one is the perfect size for active adults, but I wouldn't recommend it for, say, transporting the soccer team.  I haven't had any problems with my Camry, and I would definitely buy another.  My dream car is a convertible BMW 328i, but I'm happy with my little wagon until I can afford that Beamer!<br><br>
