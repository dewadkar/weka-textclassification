            I have owned four Saturns and the first three were ideal cars. (One I still own and love at 136,000 miles.) Unfortunately, the 2000 LS V6 has been a nightmare.  After approximately 250,000 miles on the first three, (all 1994 and newer S series)the LS has spent more time in the shop during its 33,000 miles, 11 month life than the other three combined.  It has been towed twice, and I have had the service engine soon and service wrench lights on more times than I care to count.  I have had numerous problems with &quot;non-mechanical&quot; items, such as defective door handles, quick-wearing interior, and an ever present rattle as well.  I have lost the ability to be anonymous when using my cell phone while the car is running - everyone knows it is me before I speak from the loud roar of my tires.  
As indicated by the number of miles I put on a car, I travel a lot and need dependability.  I am an adult female who is out-of-town alone often.  If I was not concerned with breakdowns, I would not have bought a new car.  More than once I have had to write out the loan payment check, while the car was in the shop.  
I am now looking for a new car again.  Considering the good luck I had with the cars made in Springhill,TN, I went to Saturn to look at trading the LS in on a S series.  They offered me $13,000. for my car.  I wonder if it had anything to do with all the 2000 and 2001 LS's piled on the lot.  Seems they are not moving as fast as they hoped.  Hmmm, what was it they used to say about Saturns retaining their value???   <br><br>
