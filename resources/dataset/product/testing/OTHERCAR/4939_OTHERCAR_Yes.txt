            When the old Saab started hinting that it's transmission was about to go, I knew it was time for shop around for another vehicle. My two concerns were sunroof and cargo space. I have to haul stuff a couple of times a month for my business.

They don't seem to make hatchbacks anymore. Gee I remember a time when every car was a hatchback. Now even the ones that look like they should be hatchbacks aren't. My business requires me to make several stops once a week, so a small pick-up was out because I needed a secure place to keep things on my weekly circuit. So I gravitated to a small SUV. 

A used CRV or RAV4 with 30K miles and no sunroof was about the same price as a new Suzuki. I paid under $16,000 for a new 2001 with 25 miles on it. I got them to throw in a multi-disk CD player, though a single disk comes standard. I should have asked for floor mats too, but I bought some decent ones at Kmart for $25. I may have gotten a good deal since the 2002s were already out. AC, power windows, locks and mirrors are also standard. There were no hidden games, like AC not being standard. This was my first new car.

The 2-Door Vitara gives me the convertable I always wanted with some decent cargo room. Actually there is no cargo room with the back seats up. I put them down the first weekend and they haven't been back up since. 

The front part of the roof, the sunroof part, goes up and down easily with push after undoing a couple of latches. Since this is manual, you don't have to worry about a sunroof motor going on you. The rear part of the roof goes on and off in a few minutes. 

There are many nice touches, besides the power mirrors and CD player. The dome light goes on when the trunk door opens. There is a power jack in addition to the cigarette lighter. 

The car is high and I broke the metal/plastic arms that hold up the rear roof backing out of my garage one morning when the garage door wasn't fully up 100%. 

It took me a few days to get used to driving a jeep like vehicle after tooling around in the Saab for a few years. I feel safe driving this car, but it's not built to go 90 down the freeway. I don't take turns at high speeds like with the Saab, but the high clearance allows me to drive up and down high curbcuts that the Saab would have bottomed out on. 

There are many favorable Suzuki reviews on this site and they are on the mark. I have had the car for 4 months now and am very pleased.
