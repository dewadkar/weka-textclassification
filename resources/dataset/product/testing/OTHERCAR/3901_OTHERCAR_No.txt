            We bought a used 1994 Plymouth Voyager with about 35,000 miles on it.  Within a few weeks it began to shift sluggishly, and at about 70,000 miles we had to have the transmission overhauled.

During the 2 years we owned it we also had to:

-replace the A/C evaporator
-replace the belt tensioner
-replace spark plug wires twice

I averaged over $100 per month in repairs, after owning 2 Hondas that almost never needed work.  I took a chance on Chrysler and regretted it a lot.  We replaced the Voyager with a Toyota Previa (same year) and have loved it!  We've never done anything to it other than maintenance.<br><br>
