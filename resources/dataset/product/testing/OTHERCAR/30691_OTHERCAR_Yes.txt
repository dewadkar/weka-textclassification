            When I was a teenager I owned a 1986 Dodge Charger.  It was a really awesome car.  I loved it.  Never gave me a problem.  I give it away when I became the proud owner of a shiny blue 1998 Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

It was a big, roomy, extremely luxurious car that rode like a dream.  LOL, I used to call it 'Kitt' after the car on the old television show <b>Knight Rider</b>.  Kitt and the Jedi had some pretty good times, up until last September.  Enter Hurricane Floyd.  I still remember it like it was yesterday.  It was a Thursday afternoon, and the rain was poring down in torrents.  I wanted to leave work early, but my boss would not allow me to.  So, I left the office promptly at five o'clock.  As I walked outside, I felt like the Morton Salt guy, as the wind was howling, and the rain was streaking sideways in true cats and dog fashion.

I got inside ole Kitt, patted her on the dashboard, and proceeded to head out into the dark of day.  The rain was pounding off my windshield, and the puddles were extraordinary.  I made it about half way home, when suddenly I came upon a road that was extremely flooded.  Car after car passed through the road with nary a problem.  So, I figured Kitt could make it as well.  I pushed my foot down on the gas pedal, and proceeded ahead.  After another hundred feet or so, I realized I had made a really big mistake.  The water was much deeper then I had perceived, and poor ole Kitt drowned.  She just stopped running.  Her lights were on, and the radio still worked, but her poor engine was flooded.  Poor ole Kitt died on the road that day.

After everything was taken care of with the insurance, I had to go out and go car shopping once again.  I thought to myself long and hard about what car I wanted to buy.  I knew I wanted something more practical and less luxurious, but also a car that looked cool to drive.  

I looked at the <b>Honda Civic</b>, the <b>Volkswagon Jetta</b>, and the <b>Pontiac Sunfire</b>.  Each of the three cars ahd their strong pluses and minuses.  However, after test driving each of them, and weighing out exactly how much I wanted to pay, I decided the Sunfire was going to be what would give me the best buy for my buck.

So, that's what became the new Tattooedjedimobile.  She is bright red, and really beautiful.  She doesn't have a name yet, so I just refer to her as the Tattooedjedimobile.  The Sunfire has a sleek, rounded design.  Essentially, it is the same car as a <b>Chevrolet Cavalier</b>, only it is slightly sleeker.  It has a fresh rounded spoiler on it's rear, and a great sporty appearance.  On the inside it's roomy enough for my little Jedi bootie.  It is equipped with a wonderfully powerful radio which allows me to blast all my CD mixes.  It has a terrific air conditioner that cools the whole car at a moments notice.  While, I've rarely sat in the back seat, my friends tell me that there is ample room to stretch out.

It drives really well also.  It hugs the road, and provides the passengers with a fairly smooth, and quiet ride.  Road noise is at a minimum on the interior, and is virtually eradicated with the radio on.  How is she on gas, you may ask next?  Well, I find that the Sunfire usually gets close to 20 miles per gallon on highway travel without the air conditioner on, or 15 with it on.  Local, it usually gets between 12 and 15 miles per gallon in stop and go driving.  All and all that is not fantastic, but is about the same as what my old Monte Carlo used to get.  The Sunfire also accelerates really quickly, making it very easy to merge onto highways and fast paced roads.

My little Sunfire also drove pretty well over this past winter's snow.  As long as I drove slow and cautiously, she did not let me down, as she provided a fairly skid free ride.

All and all, I really do not have a single complaint about my little Sunfire.  I've owned her for about months now without incident.  If you are looking for a economy priced car with a really sleek looking body style, this could be the car for you.  It provides a smooth, quality ride with no problem.  While I would not recommend this car for someone with a large family, it is pretty perfect for a single person, or for one who does not usually have many passengers in their car. 

It has lots and lots of trunk space.  In fact, I was surprised at the size trunk the car actually had.  It can definitely hold a few suitcases, and perhaps even a set of golf clubs.  

Oh yeah, one more thing.  I thought we could have a little contest here.  I'm gonna take suggestions to name the Jedi's Sunfire.  I've been having problems coming up with a name for my little Tattooedjedimobile.  So it's Claritin time everybody...time to get creative.  Let's play...it's time to name Jedi's car.  Please feel free to leave any comments or suggestions you may have as to what I can call my little car.  I will pick from the suggestions, and actually begin calling my car by that name.  Wacky, yes, I know...but that's the name of the game.  so come on, be imaginative and inventive and help me out here.

Also, if anyone can answer this question for me as well.  My Sunfire is red.  Why, oh why does it get more bird poop on it then any other car in the neighborhood?  Is it that birds are attracted to red or something?  I just don't get it.

Overall, I would have to give the Pontiac Sunfire a big thumbs up.  It is a quality car, at a quality price.  If you are looking for a car in the $12,000-$15,000 price class, I would highly recommend checking the Sunfire out.  It is a beautifully sporty car, that really will give you a smooth, carefree ride.

As always, thanks for reading...
