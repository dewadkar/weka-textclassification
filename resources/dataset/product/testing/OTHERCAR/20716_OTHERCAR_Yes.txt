            I bought my 1998 Chevy Blazer new in the summer of &quot;98.  I was getting ready to retire in a few months and I wanted a new vehicle that I thought would be durable and that would last me for a number of years.

Within the first two weeks I had my Blazer, I tried to beat a very severe storm home, but the storm won.  While waiting at the last traffic light before I would hit the country roads, high winds hit, and the top of a tree snapped off, part of it landing on the hood of my blazer.  Obviously this was of no fault of my Blazer, but nature at it's best.  So this was the first trip to the dealership.

Repairs were made, though it took three weeks to get the vehicle back.

Three months later, the first snow and ice hit our area, on the way to work, I had slid it into four wheel drive ( done by the push of a button on the console)
my intent was to drive in four wheel drive  until I would hit the county line where they salt the roads.  But I had two miles to travel thru fresh deep snow and patches of ice underneath.

The first curve I hit was a sheet of ice, and though I was not going more than 25 miles an hour, as I hit the curve and the ice the Blazer slid off the road into the ditch, almost in slow motion.  The ABS (anti lock brakes) worked, but I still went off the roadway. Fortunately I ended up backwards, facing the direction I was coming from, but was not hung up on anything.  

Four wheel drive is NOT effective on ice, but it certainly is effective in getting out of a snow filled ditch.  All I had to do was gently accelerate and I was able to drive right out of the ditch.

When I got to work, and parked the vehicle, I could not see any physical damage to the vehicle, but later in the day when I stopped back by my vehicle in the parking lot, I saw that I had a flat tire.  Apparently when I slid sideways on the ice, it must have pulled the tire away from the rim, for the mechanic that fixed the tire, found a lot of gravel and debris inside the tire.

Again...not the fault of the Blazer...just questionable driving on my part.

In the two years that I have had my Blazer, I have had it in several times for it tends to pull a bit to the left when your drive, each time they adjust this or that and say it is in &quot;specs&quot;, but a few weeks later, it always starts to sort of pull a bit to the left again.

Other than the incidents listed above, I have not had any other negative incidents with the Blazer, and two of the incidents I listed were not not the fault of the vehicle.

I take it in for general maintenance and regular oil changes, but have had no reason yet, for emergency mechanical visits.

My Blazer is pewter in color, and I DO recommend that color for anyone that does not like to wash their vehicle very often.  Even when it is down and out dirty, at first glance it always looks pretty good.  Only when you realize you can write your name on the hood, do you notice that it needs to be washed.

The Blazer came equipped with Uniroyal Tiger Paw all weather tires (NOT FIRESTONE).

The air conditioner is one of the best I have ever had in a vehicle.  In seconds it can drop the temperature from warm to almost cold, often I have to turn it on low and turn the vents away from me. 

Radio sound is decent though not exceptional.  The speakers all seem to work fine and do what they are supposed to do, which is distribute the music evenly.

I do not have a cd player, but do have a cassette player, but I have never used it.

One of the nicest features of the Blazer is the back seats, they flip and fold and you can leave one up and fold the other flat, which is convenient for me if I want to take the dogs with me.  Folding the seats is very easy, with no strain or major effort.  Simply flip the lever and fold the seat.

I have the four door model, so I do have a bit more room in the back area, though it is still small.  Four adult people in a Blazer could be considered crowded, though easily done.  Five adult people would definitely be a crowd, and I wouldn't care much to be the person in the middle.

Both seats can also fold flat, giving you a cargo carrying area in the rear, and you can get quite back there when folded flat, though if you have small packages, I think you actually get more room by leaving the seats up, as you get to utilize the floor foot area that way.

The back hatch window flips up, and the tail gate drops.  Having to use a key to open the hatch window is annoying, but you get used to it.

Fuel economy information said city driving 16 mpg and highway 20 mpg...I find this to be pretty accurate, though I tend to get a bit more than their average.

Comfort in the Blazer is average, I don't find it to be particularly hard or bumpy, just normal.

The Blazer has head lights that come on by automatically, if something happened to the sensor, I probably wouldn't know how to turn on the lights, without stopping the vehicle and looking the light controls over.  They are a mystery to me, and probably will continue to be.

The front seats in the Blazer seem to fit my back perfectly and that is important for someone that has had back problems in the past.  My husband also has and still does have back problems, but he finds the front driver seat to be extremely kind to his back.

I enjoy my Blazer, but I don't know if I would ever buy another one.  I traded my Chevy Lumina van for the Blazer and after two years it still feels cramped inside the Blazer.

My husband missed the van so much, that when I traded in my Lumina van on the Blazer, within a month, he traded in his car for another Chevy Lumina van.

If you live in a bad weather area, then a four wheel drive vehicle is almost a must, and I would certainly recommend the Blazer.  

If you have a more than two children you may want to look at a larger SUV, though I think two in the backseat is about max (adults), three could be done if they are small children, but if they are teenagers you may want to go bigger.
