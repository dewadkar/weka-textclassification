            Feel free to read my first opinion, but please note that I have added additional information to the end of this opinion that you would really benefit from reading.  I first wrote during the honeymoon period...and again I am updating this epinion... for a third time.  It seems as though my personal hell may be coming  to an end.

FIRST EPINION
I took delivery on my new Volvo S40 on October 30, 1999, and life will never be same!  I love it!  I did get alot of fun options added, but I don't think they were all necessary.  I think the only package I am missing is the "sports" package, and I also decided that I did not need a sunroof.  So, I did not get a base model.  


I went from a 6 cyl sedan to this 4 cyl 1.9 turbo.  I feel this car is much faster, as well as lighter.  Although it is the Volvo made for the younger crowd with the 5 figure income, it is a great car.  I hardly feel a bump in the road.  With Anti lock brakes, Traction control, Winter driving mode,  and Sports driving mode, any driving conditions can be conquered.  


I get 20 mpg going to and from work each day (only about 5 miles.).  I have a trip computer that will tell me what kind of mileage that I have gotten in the past 50 or so miles, as well as how many mpg I am getting at any given moment.  I also have the fun feature of how many miles until I run out of gas.  

The heat works extremely fast, and the headlight wipers are very useful when it snows.  I have options that I am still discovering.  Of course Volvo is known for it's safety, so there are drivers and passengers side airbags as well as side impact bags.  I feel extremely safe in this car.  I opted for leather interior, so of course I had to get heated seats, which I cannot believe I even lived without.  

I had the opportunity to sit in the back seat recently. It is a comfortable ride, it is not spacious, but then again I am the driver, so I really don't mind.  The truck is surprisingly spacious.  This car is very attractive. Someone chased me down at my local Blockbuster yesterday to ask me about it.  


In closing, I truly think that this is a great value, and a great auto.  I really wanted a S70, which I could not afford, but I am very happy that I chose this car.  After only 2 months, I can say that I only car I ever want to drive is a Volvo!!! 

UPDATE!!!!!!!!!

Hi there, yup, still love my car HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT... IF YOU HAVE ANY  THESE SAME PROBLEMS, PLEASE EMAIL ME: volvolights@aol.com
My mileage has been decreasing over the past 6 months.  Sticker states 17-29 mpg, regardless mine is at 16.7.  I would consider myself city driving... I expressway for about 8 minutes on the way to work. I have asked my dealer to investigate, however they only "reset the engine specifications".  They didn't check filters, spark plugs, or dragging brakes... or anything else they should have.  I changed my own spark plugs and they were total crap... after 14,000 miles.  And now My rear brakes are TOTALLY dragging (grinding on braking and acceleration).  I have been investigating this problem on the internet and have found (in the past half hour)so far 10 people that have had to PAY to have their rear pads and rotors replaced at 13,000-19,000 miles.  That is totally unacceptable.  If you are in the Chicago area and planning on buying a Volvo, contact me so I can tell you where not to purchase it.  I am not treated respectfully or intelligently at my dealer.  Once they have their money, basically you are at their mercy.  Volvo needs to replace these brakes for no charge.  There are also several other service bulletins that are out there about this car.  One of which is  52-01, clean and dry vacuum pump and seal housing.  This results in difficult braking the 1st 10 minutes of starting.  I took my car in for this and the service department told me that they could find no problem.  The bulletin states that all they needed to do was re-grease and re-seal the brake vacuum pump.  Does everyone have to be so lazy... if you are a Volvo dealer and you feel that you are fair and honest, email me and maybe my next car will come from you.

UPDATE 10/01
This car sucks.  I mean it just plain SUCKS.  The dealer knows it sucks.  DON'T BUY THIS CAR!  I have intermittent check engine light coming on, have replaced both front and rear brakes before 16,000 miles.  HAve had cam shaft retimed, 2 way valve replaced, oil leaks, transmission fluid leaks, suspension serviced, center caps on tires replaced.  Paint job sucks.  Bird crap eats through paint seems like within moments. I wash every Sunday rain or shine and it still sucks.  The seat hardware is rusting, the roof has a leak of some sort that is staining the material of the car ceiling.  Sometimes the car just won't start... and guess what??  THE DEALER CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  

IF YOUR VOLVO S40 is a lemon also, please contact me via email:
VOLVOLIGHTS@aol.com

THANKS for experiencing the emotional rollercoaster with me!!!!!

Welllllll boys and girls, my S40 is in for the 23rd time (to the dealer, silly) but it seems that they will no longer allow me to take it home.  Maybe they don't want to have this kind of relationship with me, maybe they pity me, maybe I scare them, who knows.

First of all, for those of you sad folks that have a 2000 S40 already here is some vital info for you:

There is a SECRET warranty/ recall/ campaign (whatever they are choosing to call it this time) on the braking problem... hard pedal on cold engine... not a fuse, it is some vaccum pump that needs to be replaced because moisture gets into it (and blows the fuse)... which is why it is only bad brakes on cold engine the moisture evaporates after the engine warms up...  the dealer is supposed to replace your pump with a waterproofed one.  Mine didn't until I asked.  

Anyway this info is from the DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION which just started investigating the S40 brakes.  I got a personal phone call about 4 weeks ago.  He asked me if my A/C had gone out yet, evidently when this guy calls the people who have filed brakes complaints they tell him every other problem they have... even though he is only working on safety issues... poor guy.  I do not know if this applies to the V40s.

What else sucks with this car? The repeated H7 bulbs going out.  Luckily I only pay $4 for them.  The plain old public... $15-20.  A rusty stain on the material of my ceiling around the visor hinge.  The streaks that the headlights cause on the street.  Now, if you have an S40, you will never see the road the same again.  Go, drive your car, there are streaks of light on the road...don't follow them, you'll go cross eyed or crash. And ridiculous vent reflection in the windshield.  And the fact that you cannot eject a CD when you have a beverage in the cup holder.  And it just shuts itself off whenever it wants to.  And the transmission thuds into place while shifting into 2nd gear only.  And the A/C makes these whipping noises that cause others to look over while at stop lights.  And And And And....eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

What a bucket of crap.

Volvo is buying the car back for me or trading me out of it... however you would like to word it.  Truly amazing.  I am happy, but this car caused me so much misery. What happened to the 240's and 740's?  Still going, and I have a 2.5 year old, 27,000 miles piece of junk.

All I can say is read all you can and request the warranty work history on the next car you buy. 

BECAUSE GUESS WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO WITH MY CAR?

They are going to wholesale it to another dealer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't know if I can live with the guilt, but I will just be happy to be rid of the car.

If you would like the VIN number to the car from hell, feel free to email me. It may be on a dealer lot near you in the upcoming weeks.  Scary, ain't it?

UPDATE 12-2002
This car was sold to someone in the Northwest suburbs on October 29, 2002.  Congratulations!  Obviously this person did not investigate this model car!  

Happily driving my S60.
