               I love the looks of the GS 400, it's lustful style and the mad reving V-8. It was and always will be the perfect car for me! The car goes from 0-60 in less than 6 seconds, and that very well matches it's looks. 
   The craftsmanship in the car is just what I would have expected you would get in a Toyota/Lexus, great build quality. This car is great, but all great things have flaws, for example, the car is very sporty but the steering feel is mushy and there is more body lean than necessary.
   The feeling when driving this car is great when you are in the mood to go fast. When I first got this car I put 3,000 miles on it the very month I bought it because I fell in love with it, it was like my way of gettig all the stress out of me.<br><br>
