            This car is truly a Lexus in a Toyota wrapper.  It has quality through and through, from its real wood inserts through its attention to detail.  The car&#146s ride is smooth and luxurious even on long, extended drives.  The seats are supportive, the dash well configured and engine quite yet responsive.  The room in the back is truly cavernous and all my friends are astounded by the leg and hip room.  I investigated many cars before purchasing this one and I can truly say that 1-year and 12,000 miles later I have no regrets.  I have not had to bring the car back to the dealer for anything except the normal oil changes which I normally due religiously every 3,000 &#150 5,000 miles.

As with any care there are MINOR draw backs or irritations with model options or configurations.  With the Avalon, I have only found two that bother me.
1.	The heated seats do not recycle nicely.  You may have to wait as long as 20 minutes to turn them back on after they feel the job is done.
2.	In very bright sunlight, it is nearly impossible to read the radio display.  A brighter output such as orange is called for.
I would tell anybody looking for a Full-Sized car that this is the one to get.  I would suggest spending the extra $1,800 for the navigation system, it is a real God-send to directionally challenged people like me.
