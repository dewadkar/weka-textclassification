            In July, I bought a 1986 Chevy Nova (US-built, restyled Toyota Corolla) with 268,000 miles, with some accident damage and an engine which ran on 2 cylinders for $60.  The body was not rusty and the manual transmission was good, so I decided to fix the car up.  I have never taken an engine apart before, but it was surprisingly easy to replace the cylinder head gasket (a major job which would cost several hundred dollars at a garage)  After spending a little under $1000 (including some sharp rims/bigger tires) the car looks and runs like new.  Now having reached 278,000 in only a few months, I'm amazingly impressed by how dependable this car is, with over a quarter of a million miles on the clock.  It drives like a new car, handles nicely (with the bigger wheel/tires) and is completely rattle and problem-free.  Even with a carbureted engine, it starts up on the first try even when it is below 0 outside.  I'm looking forward to reaching the 300,000 mile mark sometime next year. The car is a pleasure to drive, I often take it on an aimless drive just for fun.  Having done my own repairs when first purchased, and regular maintenance, I wouldn't hesitate to say that this is one of the best engineered older vehicles I have seen.
