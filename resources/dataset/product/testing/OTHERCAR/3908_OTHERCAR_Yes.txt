            I have officially joined all the other &quot;life is over's&quot; out there. Now having my 3rd child, space is a huge factor when driving somewhere. I always thought we would just go bigger &amp; bigger when upgrading &amp; get a Tahoe or something. After much pricing &amp; comparing of mini-vans to mini-vans &amp; mini-vans to SUV's, this is the van we chose. 
We opted for the Premiere edition of the Silhouette. This is the 1st official year the Silhouette has been labled &quot;Premiere&quot; on the exterior of the van. 
Here are some of the many options this van offers. The ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM offers a VHS player, a new, enlarged 6.8&quot; LCD color monitor, four pairs of cordless headphones,  second-row speakers, a remote control with on-screen programming and auxiliary jacks to plug in a video game or camcorder.
The REAR PARKING AID gives you audio and visual warning when nearing various obstacles.  It works while the vehicle is in reverse, going less than 3 mph. 
ON STAR  offers on the push of a button, connection to a OnStar Advisor that can help you twenty-four hours a day in the U.S. and Canada. They can direct you to hotels, ATM's &amp; track your vehicle if stolen. If you lock yourself out, they will remotely unlock your Premiere for you.
a third-row bench that can be folded and stowed away by one person in a snap, providing a flat spacious cargo floor.
Third-row stowable bench includes rear convenience center with compartments &amp; hooks for cargo-carrying options. It folds away when not in use.
The 3400 SFI V6 engine will have years of trouble-free driving.It features long-life engine coolant and transmission fluid. And has spark plugs that have a 100,000-mile* replacement schedule. The other features include a maintenance-free battery and a stainless steel exhaust system. The exterior is something that drew us to this van as well. The design is not one typical of mini-vans. The design is sleek &amp; the chrome wheels offer a nice added look.And the rack &amp; pinion steering responds well to quick steering &amp;/or turns.
Some of the other features I won't go into detail about include, heated seats, heated outside mirrors, rear wiper &amp; defrost, remote/keyless side door entry, CD/cassette, power seats, leather interior, LATCH SYSTEM, air compressor etc.
I would recommend this to any family with more than 2 children. It is comfortable &amp; we feel safe in it. The only things I can think to mention that are negative, is the ride being bouncier in the rear. My kids have not mentioned it, I noticed myself, when riding back there. And the price is a little steep for some. It is $33,000 or so for this particular model. We got ours for $28,000 after much searching &amp; haggling.
