               Although the 2003 Hyundai Tiburon is a dramatic improvement in all respects over its previous generation, the predecessor cars such as the 2000 Hyundai Tiburon still offer a healthy amount of positive attributes. While having a relatively low-grade, unrefined twin cam, 2.0 4-cylinder as it's only power plant, and a somewhat mediocre suspension, the 2000 Tiburon offers aggressive styling, innovation, and economy at a price that most car manufacturers for this model year just couldn't match. While many buyers will opt for the successor models, (2003 models) the 2000-2001 Hyundai Tiburon's offer a great value on the used car market.

 <b>For the 2000 Model year</b>, the Hyundai Tiburon comes in no trim lines ( FX trim lines are gone) and 1 body style; a 2 door coupe. There are no engine options for the 2000 model year. Standard for 2000 is the carryover engine from 1999's FX models; a 2.0 DOHC 4-cylinder (same engine that powers the 2000 Elantra) that pumps out 140 horsepower and 133 lb-ft of torque. Transmissions include a 5-speed manual transmission ( equipped on tester) and an optional 4-speed fully automatic.

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

While the horsepower specs from the 2.0 liter DOHC engine may seem commendatory, this car was not designed mechanically for out-right performance in any fashion. Off- the-line <b>acceleration</b> comes sufficiently, however many cars with less horse power, such as the base Toyota Celica 1.8, and even the Ford ZX2 come with much sportier road manners, including quicker take-offs. The Tiburon's 5-speed manual transmission furthers this car's inability to make fast jumps from the light. The shifter is too small which made it somewhat hard to reach, and shifting into gears 'quickly'  was to say the least "aggravating;" the throws were much too long. Embarrassingly a few times I found myself placing the gear shifter halfway into gear due to the long throws which made for grinding, high revving, etc. Taking off from a standing start, once I got the shifter down, came surprisingly hushed. While hushed take-offs are great for many cars, I feel an expressive exhaust note would fit the exterior and interior character of the 2000 Hyundai Tiburon much better. 

  <b>Handling</b> is impressive. Unlike the powertrain in the 2000 Tiburon, the chassis/suspension systems offer more of a sport feel to it. Despite being based on the Elantras' platform, running this car through the twistys is fun, and very little body roll/lean can be felt. At high speeds however this car can feel a bit unstable which can get a little hectic, but overall this car is does well in this department. Relatively large, low profile tires (P195/55/HR15s) are added which aid in the fun factor through twisty situations.

Unlike the 2003 models, the 2000 Tiburon does not find its home on the freeways and expressways. <b>Cruising</b> is harsh both through town and at speeds up to and above 60 MPH. Wind noise is kept to a minimum, but constant rattles, jolts on bumpy surfaces, and roadgrain noise can be quite annoying.
Cars like the 2000 Toyota Celica, 2000 Honda Civic, and even the 2000 Dodge Neon all do a better job at keeping the occupants in a hushed and composed environment. Hills are taken fairly well. Unlike the 2003 models, when equipped with the 2.7 liter V6, the standard 2.0 in the 2000 Tiburon struggles to maintain speeds in high gear at 65-70 MPH up steep inclines. A down-shift into 4th provides all the power needed, however many cars in this class for the 2000 model year do a much better job tackling the mountainous roads.

As an almost $3,000 equipment package, my test 2000 Tiburon came with standard 4-wheel disc brakes, but had additional 4-wheel ABS that is only is available with this numerological option. <b>Braking</b> is excellent, as expected, and next to handling is probably this car's strongest asset in the performance department. Braking is firm, very quick, and allows for driver confidence while approaching stops a high speeds. 

<b>Fuel economy</b> is good, with an EPA of 23/32 the 2000 Hyundai Tiburon won't break you with high fuel costs. 

<b>Performance Gripes:</b> More power, or a more refined engine. This has been delt with for the 2003 model year.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

The <b>interior</b> of the 2000 Tiburon, while containing mostly cheap-o materials, has a very sport oriented design. The HVAC controls and the large 'easy to read' instrument cluster gauges are dressed with silver/gray chrome looking accents, which make them look more like metal instead of the plastic that they really are. The plastics on almost all sections of the Tiburon are of a 'pleather' like consistency. Instead of basic flimsy plastic used in cars like the 2000-2003 Nissan Sentra's, the plastic actually has a good look and feel to it. Ergonomics are excellent, the HVAC controls are perfectly placed, and the CD/tape player can boast the same claim. As part of the $3,000 dollar optional list of equipment, the 100 watt 6-speaker CD/tape/AM/FM radio player sounded excellent. Unlike many sporty cars, the standard equipment for the 2000 Tiburon comes completely loaded. Some noteworthy standard amenities include, dual front air bags, cruise control ( which has to be turned on using a dash control, then operated via the controls that are connected to a steering wheel wand), tilt steering, power windows, locks, 2 cup holders, a tachometer, and AC. Optional equipment on my tester included a power tilt sunroof, a small center console, and an Am/FM single CD player with cassette that is very easy to operate. Seating is somewhat accommodating, but only for adults 6' and under. The cloth sport bucket seats are comfortable enough, which offer good bolstering, but being 5'6" I had to recline the seats halfway just so my head would not hit the ceiling, the rear actually felt like it had more head room than the front. Leg room in both the front and rear is tight, even for small adults. 50/50 split bench seats are added in the rear for added hatch space. With the rear seats folded up there is little space for groceries or storage in general.

<b>Interior Gripes:</b> HVAC vents are oddly placed. 2 directly in the middle of the dash, and 2 on the doors give more air to your knees than to the rest of your body.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

 The <b>exterior</b> of the 2000 Tiburon, like its 2003 modeled successor, was, and still is its biggest selling asset. The front fascia is a little 'Acura Intrgra' looking, while the rear remains very 'Hyundai Tiburon.' With bulging fenders, swooping lines, a muscular hood, and rear 'novelty' air pocket vents, the 2000 Tiburon is one to stand out in a crowd. Perhaps a little overdone in design, you still have to respect the fact that Hyundai has made a excellent effort to improve its image over the '99 modeled Tiburon's. Standard on the 2000 Tiburon comes handsome 5-spoke alloy rims. Optional visual cues are mud flaps, and a '96-'99 Ford Taurus looking spoiler that somehow looks good on this vehicle. 

<i>Price and Reliability:</i>

 While once claimed one of the worst cars for reliability (1986-1994) in the automotive market, Hyundai can now boast at least acceptable reliability. According to many sources Hyundai owners are still having major problems with their vehicles (nowhere hear as much however), on the contrary the owner of this 2000 Hyundai Tiburon had no problems whatsoever since being purchased in 2000, and having over 16,000 miles on the odometer, <b>www.consumer reports.org</b> may have more info. Prices for these cars are excellent! For 2000, with the optional packages suggested, the 2000 Tiburon was close to $18,000. Today these cars can be had with less than 20K miles for around $10,000-$12,000. With the 2003 models being much more desirable, many owners are selling their older models for cheap.  

<b>Conclusion:</b> This is a car with sporty looks, that offers more show than go. This car should not be purchased with out-right performance in mind, instead as economical, sporty, good looking transportation.
