            After almost 175,000 miles on its original motor and tranny, what more can I say about this car?  It is absolutely one of the finest cars I have had the pleasure of owning and, I have owned quite a few to know the difference.  This is one of the most economical cars available.  I have got as much as 45MPG on the highway and never fail to get at least 32MPG driving in the city.  Through the years I have done some running repairs on the car &#150 changed the brakes a few times, and the muffler - but I live in Syracuse, and the salt always pull a number on the undercarriage.  Still, the body is in remarkable shape with only 2 small rust points &#150 partly caused by my own clumsiness.  I have never had any repairs done on the engine, other than for changing the plugs every 40,000 miles or so, and the distributor assembly ones.  The small but peppy engine is fast to respond, even though it obviously lacks in power.  Handling is superb &#150 very easy and precise steering; almost feel as if you are driving a more expensive sports coupe.  The ride, well it is no Mercedes, but given the vehicle size and class, it is commendable.  Almost no body-roll, even in tight cornering; and suspensions are tight and sturdy.  
On the disadvantage side, you need to understand that this is a small car.  While at 6 feet in height, I can sit comfortably in the front, the few times I have tried to sit in the rear it was very cramped!  While the instruments are easily accessible and well placed, this car has the worst placed cup holders!  If there is one thing that I detest about this car &#150 it is the cup holders, which are placed right in front of the stereo, almost making it impossible to access any of its controls.  The stereo has much to be desired, but the standard equipments available for the car is very good.  
Compared to its import rivals &#150 Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Mazda 323/Protege and the Mitsubishi Mirage, the Nissan Sentra has an edge over all of them.  It is obviously much cheaper than the Civic and the Corolla and still as reliable and durable as they are.  Though the Sentra does not command as high an after market price as the Honda and Toyota, it is good news for the buyers.  It has a better ride than the Mirage and is more durable and reliable than the much-flawed similar vintage Proteges available.  
In conclusion &#150 if you want an economical, small, reliable car, the Nissan Sentra is one car that you absolutely cannot overlook.
