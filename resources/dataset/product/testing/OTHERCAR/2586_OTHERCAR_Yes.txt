            We purchased a 1995 plymouth voyager rallye and it is a great running
car with dual air. friends and family claim it rides like a lincoln
towncar, smooth rideing..great cold air...todate has been hassle free.  only recently did we have to buy new tires and a battery the original
battery carcked.we get 23 to 27 miles per gallon on long trips, and 19 in city driving...the only drawback is the way the seats were placed in 
the van..the benchan seat should have been placed behing drivers seat
because it makes it difficult for people to enter and disembark the van.
when i am ready for a trade in and these changes have been made i will 
consider a tradein... thank you<br><br>
