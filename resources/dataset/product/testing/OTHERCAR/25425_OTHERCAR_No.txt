            This is my first car.  I bought a '98 SC2 partly because it looked cool and I didn't want a Ford ZX2 or Honda Civic (too many of them).  My friend has a '96 SL and he didn't have any problems--so I figured what the heck...  

Boy was I wrong.  The car has the worst trunk design ever, the hinges crush whatever is inside and the hook protrudes catching everything and poking holes in my parcels--I don't think Saturn tested it before approving the design.  The turn signal sucks.  It takes a bodybuilder to operate them.  Apparently, all Saturns are like this.  So, I rarely use them.  This is just the start...

Currently, I have 35K miles.  

When I first got the car, it had three problems: 1)incorrectly installed weatherstripping, 2)loosely anchored driver's and passenger's seats (safety concern), and 3)loose heater hose which makes a very annoying sound over rough roads.

After 15K miles, the car began to get extremely noisy.  The dashboard started rattling--in numerous places.  So I had to upgrade the factory stereo to drown out the noise. All I can say is that I probably need a thousand dollar system to drown out the harshness of the car. 

After one hot summer, the cheap plastic dash began to look even cheaper, and the plastic interior parts faded in color.  The dash components are all DIFFERENT shades of black now.  Its an eyesore.

After 25K, the engine hesitates at 3rd @ 40 mph when stepping on the gas. That's accompanied by a strange gurggling sound from the engine.  After about 2 seconds of flooring the gas, the engine decides to downshift and teh noise goes away.

After 30K, the engine continues to make strange rattling sounds and the dealer claims there's nothing wrong with it (yeah right--its the &quot;design&quot; right?!).  Also, car hesitates in 2nd gear @ 30 MPH now.  I better not have to take the car in for a major engine/tranny repair in the near future.

After 35K, the car doesn't start until you turn and hold the key for 2-3 seconds.  Not a good sign.  Also the car is extremely noisy and the dash/steering wheel vibrates violently when first starting the car.  The vibration subsides after the engine warms up.  Also, there is a new strange popping sound coming from the engine compartment.  When idle, the engine makes a high whistling sound, similar to 10+ year-old cars.  I will have the dealer look at this problem next time I take it in for service.

This car has been babied and well-maintained.  This car doesn't age well.  My friend thought the car had 100K...Oh My God!

This is my first and last Saturn.  Probably my first and last American car, too.  People who don't enjoy the spirit of driving and aren't selective about their cars should buy Saturns.

The service is over-rated and over-priced and the marketing teams at Saturn are so good, they can sell ice to eskimoes.  Don't believe their advertising and propaganda.
