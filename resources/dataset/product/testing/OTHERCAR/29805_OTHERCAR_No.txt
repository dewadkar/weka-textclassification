            My husband bought me the DC 260 Kodak digital camera last christmas. I was so excited to start using it. I read all the directions and thought I understood it well.   I have had nothing but problems with this camera.  It is endless.  It is now sitting at Kodak to be repaired.  When this camera works, it takes wonderful pictures. It is just not very reliable.  I have had problems with downloading pictures and my pictures becoming a corrupt file (EX files) and are subsequently lost forever.  I think that if you are interested in this camera, purchase it with a return policy of no less than 1 wk and use it until you are satisfied that you are happy.  The software that comes with it is antiquated and has several area which are not usable.  The pictures take a while to download and they don't all download even when you select the 'select all ' option.  The other downfall is that this camera goes through lots of batteries.<br><br>
