            I bought my sunfire used, it's a '95 model and it was previously a rental car. I've had it for nearly a year. I have givin this car a really hard time. I drive it to concerts all over the U.S. I drove it with me and 3 friends to Florida from Kentucky and it did not once give me any kind of problem. 
While in Florida(spring break) we did the whole crusing thing, which is probobly the most damaging kind of driving you can have, due to the continual stop and go conditions. Then afetr a week and a half of that, we jumped in and took it all the way back to Kentucky. it was a 12 hour drive and the car just took it like a champ. 
I don't really give this car the attention it deserves, I don't change the oil every 3000 miles, it's more like every 5000, but, it still goes. I do try to keep it clean. I bought this car beacuse my step father is an auto body repair specialist and he suggested it because parts for it are reletively inexpensive, it looks sporty and is a good car. 
I've heard horror stories about the '94 model, but the problem with them is that blew cylynders really easily, and pontiac fixed this problem on the '95. I love my car, and it loves me back, even though I do neglect it sometimes<br><br>
