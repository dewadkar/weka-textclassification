            My Rodeo has seen about as much duty that a privately owned vehicle could and all in all I've been very satisfied. I bought my Rodeo as a bachelor, and drove it in the mountains, in rain, in ice, in snow, in mud, in sand and in water and I have always felt safe. I've pulled boats and trailers and always have had enough power. The major positives are: Handling, power, mileage and safety. The negatives are: A little uncomfortable on long trips and the spare tire can block your view, (I've heard they've changed it).It's a fun ride <br><br>
