            With the lease on my 1997 Honda Civic DX paid off, I find myself with a little under a year to own a car free and clear before I have to turn the sweet thing in.  So naturally, I'm looking <i>now</i>.

I like my Civic, but...well, let's face it, there are only about a zillion of the things on the road.  I'm getting rather tired of losing my car at the mall, or looking like I'm in the Honda parade during rush hour.  Plus, having another subcompact in the Kia, I would kind of like a vehicle I could actually <i>put</i> stuff in, without killing the budget.

Yeah, I know.  I have some issues owning a <i>station wagon</i> - not exactly macho, is it? But in rush hour traffic, taint any of us looking all that impressive anyway.

Today I dragged the wife along and went for a test spin of the new <b>Suzuki Esteem Wagon</b>.

On first impression, the car won't turn too many heads.  It isn't ugly by any means - in fact, compared to the old Escort wagons, or the newer Saturn�s and Daewoo�s it's downright beautiful.  Visual lines flow from front to back, without being too aerodynamic; a modern looker without going overboard.  The roof-mounted rack adds a touch of style to the package, and the rear taillights wrap around the side to add a bit of contrast.  Still, it suffers from the same problem all cars of this class suffer from - it looks like a car with a topper slapped on the back.

Paint choices are basic, but pretty: Silver, Green, Dark and Light Blue, Black, White, a dark Red.  The top of the line GLX+ model can be had in two-tone, Blue/Silver or White/Silver.  Most of the colors weren't stand out, but both shades of blue caught my eye, as did the blue two-tone model.

Normally, I wouldn't consider getting the top of the line - I ain't rich. However, considering the Esteem tops out at $14,899 (depending on dealer markups), it's a possibility.  That is a whole 500 dollars more then today's bare bones Civic sedan is going for, at least in my neck of the woods.

Intriguing, but let's shake this baby out.

At 172 inches long and 66.1 inches wide, it's just a tad smaller then my Civic, but with tons more storage space - 61 cubic feet, with the rear seats down.  Also, Suzuki has added wonderful little storage touches.  Lifting what I thought was the spare tire cover revealed many compartments for tools, flashlights, safety flares, etc, all located on the <i>real</i> cover.  The spare of course is of the donut variety.

Interior room for my non-beefy 5 foot 6 inch frame was adequate; I actually felt a little tall as the seating is a bit higher then the Civic.  Sitting down, I noticed the logical placement of dials covering everything from fuel to tachometer, easy access to comfort controls and the Clarion cassette radio - and more storage compartments.  The seats were comfy, though a little lacking in lumbar support, and the steering wheel feels too slender.

Starting up the 1.8 liter 16 valve DOHC engine, I pulled out of the dealership hoping to test out those 122 horses.  Well, I wouldn't win too many drag races, but the acceleration was decent, and power was available through every gear without hesitation.  Ride was about as smooth as the Honda, but cornering felt a little odd, just a wee bit body roll going on.  It wasn't excessive, and the oddness was due in part to the difference in the cars center of gravity compared to what I'm used to.  Overall a pleasant ride, one I could live with.  Some reviews have called it lackluster performance, but it really felt as speedy as the Honda, if less refined.

All models of wagon come with AC, a decent AM/FM Cassette deck, power steering and brakes, rear defogger, annoying daytime running lights, and the standard duel air bags/side impact beams.  GLX and GLX+ models get the power window/locks package, remote mirrors, keyless remote, cruise control, and <b>more storage areas</b>.  Sheesh.  GLX+ adds a power sunroof and the option of two-tone paint.

Suzuki seems allergic to tilt steering.  Why they don't just include tilt as an option is beyond me.

Overall, I'd have to say...I don't know yet.  Obviously I'm not ready to jump right back into monthly payments, and Honda is planning on...FINALLY...updating the Civic design in August, so I'm taking a wait and see.  But the Esteem is not a bad little car, for a wagon, and Suzuki has served the wife�s family well over the past 10 years with 2 very reliable Sidekicks, so I have no fear there.  It just didn't give me the buzz the Civic did when I first spied it - no love at first sight, but we could be friends.

A pleasant car loaded with plenty of options for its class, and a very decent price range.  Not overwhelming to say the least, but an option for future consideration.
