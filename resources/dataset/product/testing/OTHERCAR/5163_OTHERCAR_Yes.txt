            I purchased my Dakota (extended cab) to replace a smaller Ford Ranger. I also moved from a 4cly to the V6 engine. It was a toss-up between another Ranger with similar features, but Dodge beat them on the price, so I went with them. I use this truck as my primary vehicle. I don't do a lot of 'truck-type&quot; work, but when I do, there's been no problems thus far. The engine is strong and fuel consumption is low (~20MPG) compared to friend's bigger trucks.

I love the comfort in driving this truck and the room it offers. That was a major selling point from moving from the smaller truck. I ramble a lot and like carrying fishing gear and other items and the large cab of the Dakota can store them easily and keep two riders comfortable. I do not like the way the Dakota performs on wet surfaces or snow. My model is the sport and the truck with the extra kick spins very easily and will strand you quickly if you don't watch out. 

If you're looking for an off-road, two-wheel-drive truck, steer clear of the Dakota, or order one with positive traction and/or 4WD.

The Dakota handles great and is extremely enjoyable to drive. I have made several +500 mile runs and felt good afterward.
