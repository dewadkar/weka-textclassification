            having no experience with digital cameras, i was shopping for something reliable and easy to use in the 2+ megapix range.  short movies with sound and a decent zoom lens were biggies on my list.  that narrowed things down pretty quickly and as soon as i checked out the c700uz, i had to have it.  the price was high but i soon realized that the awesome 10x optical lens, olympus reputation, and abundant features are well worth a little extra ching.  after some experience, a thrifty c700uz operator can make a good picture out of any situation.  the camera is small enough to allow it to tag along with me almost anywhere.  the lens extends an inch while in use but tucks away after being turned off.  its features range from completely automatic to fully manual, white balance adjustments for different lighting conditions making colors more real, spot metering, macro, several flash modes, self timer, movies with sound, etc.

about the movies- no matter the size of the smartmedia card, you can only take 16s (HiQ) and 62s (StandardQ) movies before the camera has to write it on the card.  the optical zoom can be used before starting the movie but is limited to the 2.7x digital once rolling.

speaking of zoom, a tripod is helpful when getting way in there on the action to prevent blur, especially under low light.  also, with any picture it seems like a steadier hand is required compared to a film camera to get a clear image.  olympus has the highly recommended c2100 with stabilized lens to combat hand shake if this is a concern.  those two drawbacks along with the purple fringing (highly backlit objects and bright lights have thin purple perimeters) common to many digicams are my minor complaints.  after 5 months of steady abuse this thing redefines "durable".

some necessities not included are a carrying case (even though it fits in a shirtpocket), rechargeable NiMH set, and a bigger memory card.

i barely scratched the surface of the c700uz's capabilities in this review and if you want the nitty-gritty, check out www.steves-digicams.com for comparisons, specs, and sample pix.
