            My husband purchased our 1996 Dodge Stratus 3 years ago, and we have had one problem after another with it.  First of all, with only 30,000 miles, the transmission blew out on the freeway.  Also, we have repeatedly had to take it in to be worked on because of electrical problems, like the windows and door locks and brake lights not working.  For a fairly new car, we have been very disappointed with our purchase of the Stratus.

We still are driving the car because it still looks really nice, and it drives comfortably.  We feel like we may have just got a lemon, because we do know others who are happy with their Dodge Stratus.

We would personally not recommend this car, based on our own experiences.<br><br>
