            The Olympus C-2000 Zoom Digital Camera features 2.11 Megapixel CCD, 1600x1200 Resolution, 3x Optical Zoom with selectable controls, 8MB SmartMedia� Card, and Burst Mode Shooting (taking up to 45 images at 2 per second at any resolution).  With this profesional camera your amazing will come out very profesionaly.  The digital camera has an auto flash with 5 modes: auto-Flash(lowlight and backlight), red-eye reduction, off, fill, and external.  The C-2000 Zoom has a self timer, rapid-fire snapshot capability and can conect directly to your TV or VCR.  My camera came with Adobe� PhotoDeluxe�, Enroute QuickStitch�, Olympus Camedia� Master, 8MB SmartMedia� Card, 4 AA nickel hydride batteries, and a battery charger.  It is a great product, but comes at a high price.<br><br>
