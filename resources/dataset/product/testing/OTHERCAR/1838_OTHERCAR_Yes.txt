<TEXT>
            I have a 1997 Grand Am SE with about 58,000 miles on it.  It never has given me much trouble at all.  It has broken down very few times in the past 4 years. The only thing I can remember doing was blowing my alternator.

<b>Speed</b>
The Grand Am�s V6 engine provides plenty of power for the car, as for an Standard Edition car it is very fast.  It is fast compared to many other cars also.

<b>Handling</b>
I think the car handles very well, however I don�t exactly like the turning radius.  I always find my self having to make K turns when I know in a little bit smaller car I could have made the U turn.  Anyway, there isn�t much one can do about that and it isn�t much of a big deal.

<b>Fuel Efficiency</b>
It takes about a little under $20 more or less depend on gas prices to fill up the tank.  This isn�t too bad, and I notice I get pretty good mileage.  I have never really checked out the mileage details though.

<b>Comfort</b>
I love the seats in the Grand Am 97, I think they are extremely comfortable.  My brother got a 2000 Grand Am GT and although I like the car a lot, the seats are horribly uncomfortable.  The adjustability of the seats in the 97 Grand Am could use a little improvement though.  The roominess in the back of the car is a little crammed, but it is not real bad.

<b>Other Pros</b>
<b>-</b> The speakers the car comes with are very good. Compared to what other cars come with you notice a big difference.
<b>-</b> The trunk is a very roomy size.
<b>-</b> The circular design of the air conditioner / heat slots lets you shoot air at you in almost any way.  It is really a great feature.

<b>Some Cons</b>
Notice I have yet to mention many Cons.  This is because I really can�t think of too many.  One thing that always angered me is that there was no cd player, however I just plugged in a portable one.  The A/C also only has 4 notches, so I think the max A/C could be a little stronger� Don�t get me wrong though the car gets real cold pretty  quickly.
