            After selling my Porsche for more room and loving the styling of the M3, I have driving the car for four months and will be selling it as I just ordered another Porsche.

Unfortunately, I bought the car without a test drive, as it was not at any dealer to try out.  I imported it through an import company who specializes in M3s.

Although this M3 is considerably better than the last, it still suffers from being a "car for the masses".  That means it has a too soft of a suspension at the detrement of handling and cornering.  It really disappoints in this department.  Another problem is that the car is way too heavy, thus making the 343 HP feel like 250.  I use this figure as I saw this with my own two eyes as a Porsche Boxster S accelerates neck and neck with the M3 Cabriolet and then blows it away in the corners!

Back to the "Masses" comment, the seats....they are made for a 275 pound driver...as if you weigh less than this, you will slide left and right while cornering.  Very disappointing.

The exhaust note....at first, you think it is cool.  Then with the time it bugs you as it is very high pitched.  Somehow, I think the BMW engineers made the exhaust loud to compensate for the poor acceleration due again to the heaviness of the car.  At least it sounds like you are going fast.

The steering is very sloppy and requires way too much rotation of the steering wheel for sporty driving.

The "Sport Button", you will find yourself always driving with this pushed, as the car is even more boring otherwise!

The HK Stereo.....save your money, it is absolutely terrible!

On the positive side, the brakes are very good.  Plus, if you are looking for a "sporty cabriolet", it is comfortable and has room for four.

This car is not a "Sports Car"!
