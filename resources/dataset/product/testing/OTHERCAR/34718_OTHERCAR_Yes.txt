            I just excepted delivery of a 2000 JXI Limited Black(body) on Black(top) on black(interior) which I special ordered back in October.  I traded in a 92 Ford Taurus SHO for this car.  So far (800 miles) this car has far exceeded my expectations.  It is without a doubt one of the best looking American cars on the market today.  While the performance of the V6 in no way compares to the power of the SHO's, it is very exceptable especially combined with the 'AutoStick' transmission included with the Limited package.  I have consistently received aprox. 22 to 23 Mpg and expect this to get better with age.  I rented a JXI and got 30+ in highway mileage.  The build quality is excellent and other than one minor flaw in the paint job I have absolutely no complaints.  The space afforded by the Sebring is about the best offered by any convertible on the market today.<br><br>
