            I bought my 1994 GS Galant as &quot;new&quot; back in 1995.  The dealer had been driving it so it had about 7K miles on it, but it had never been titled, so technically it was a new car.  Initially I have to say I loved this car, and still can't complain, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it as a used car to anyone.

Mitsubishi is great at coming up with lots of neat features at a great price.  Back in 1994 this car had a TON of features for the money.  Moonroof, remote door locks, in dash CD player, fog lamps, and cruise.  
It's still a lot cheaper than the Accord or Camry, but there's a reason.  

MAINTENANCE ISSUES:
Mitsubishi has a good warranty and my dealer had a great service department, but the problem is we got to know each other too much.  First there was the recalls for the brake pedal switch and front suspension.  Both were replaced for free, but not an encouraging thing. Driving on urban street full of potholes the suspension has worn rather quickly and the ride is not nearly as tight or comfortable as it once was.

Then there was the electrical system problems.  The dealer told me to not bother replacing the fog lamps.  They are expensive and tend to blow after only a few months.  (I was told water tends to get in and cause the bulb to blow.)  Add to that the door switch which turns on the interior light. I've replaced it twice and it's not working again.

At this point I have 80K miles on the vehicle and it's burning oil.  I have to be sure to check in between changes which I do fairly religiously every 3K miles.

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS CAR:
I can't say this vehicle isn't without redeeming features.
Really it's strong point has always been that it has a lot of creature comforts.  Mitsubishi makes a great radio, and this one is no different.  I've yet to make the CD skip and the sound is excellent.

The interior layout is excellent with well place cruise controls and well thought out armrest to store CDs.  Controls are easy to operate and well placed; visibility is excellent.

Performance is also good.  The GS has a slightly higher performing engine and with the 5 speed,gets off the line and passes admirably for a 4 cylinder engine.  Steering was initially excellent but has soften to acceptable as the suspension has loosened with age.

BOTTOM LINE:
I've got my money's worth out of this car, but it hasn't been pain free.  I really can't recommend this car to others and won't sell it as a used car.  At this point I just use it to drive to work and will probably do so for another couple years till it dies or really causes a major repair.  My experience is enough to swear me off from Mitsubishi until they do something extraordinary to prove they've gone up the quality ladder substantially.  Pay the extra and get a used Camry or Accord.  It's worth it.
