            The Olympus D-510 is the best digital camera on the market for under $400, and it is a great all-around camera.  The highlights of the D-510 are:

<b>(1) 2.1 Megapixels</b>
The film industry introduced the Advantix film a few years ago when they found out that 99% of all pictures were developed at 5x7 or smaller.  With 2.1 megapixels, you can make perfect prints up to 5x7.  1.3 megapixel is not quite enough for 5x7 prints and 3+ megapixel cameras are still much too expensive.  2.1 megapixel is a great compromise.

<b>(2) Olympus Optics</b>
Olympus has great optics.  The D-510 lens is of the highest quality.  The D-510 lens is also faster than the competitors' lenses.  A faster lens = smaller f number = bigger opening in the lens, allowing the camera to capture more light and produce better pictures.

<b>(3) QuickTime Movie Mode</b>
In addition to taking great still photos, the D-510 can take QuickTime videos (video only, no audio).  You can then download the video to the PC for easy uploading to your web site.  In the HQ mode, you get great quality video.

<b>(4) USB, Batteries, SmartMedia</b>
USB capability is a must for digital picture taking.  Serial connection is too slow to transfer large amount of data.  Having USB connection ON the digital camera is not that important since you can separately purchase USB readers for around $20 nowdays, but having it built-in to the camera enables you to download directly without the adapter, so this is definitely a plus.  The ability to use AA batteries is also really handy (you can also use lithium batteries).  AA batteries are easy to find and they are cheap.  It's best, though, if you use NiMH rechargeables as they contain more power than alkalines plus you only have to buy them once.  Some digital cameras (like many Kodak's or Sony's) use proprietary rechargeable batteries which are expensive and hard to find.  With the D-510, even if you lose charge in your rechargeables, you can easily find AA alkalines at just about any store.  As for storage, the camera only comes with an 8MB SmartMedia card.  But you can buy 32MB or even 64MB SmartMedia cards for really cheap on the Internet.  I picked up a 64MB SM card for under $40.

I looked at all the comparable Kodak, HP, Fuji, and Toshiba models, and none came close to this Olympus.  I bought mine on line for $350.
