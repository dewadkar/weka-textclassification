            In 1999 my family went to St. Louis Missouri in search of a new car and I wasn't happy with what they came home with. Just before this search we owned a 1995 mazda 626 which I wasn't really old enough to recognize its attributes. So all we did was upgrade form a 95 to a 99 woopy doo. So I have had to the chance to drive this vehicle many many times and am yet to be impressed.

This car has a 4 cylinder engine that doesn't impress me at all. We have had this thing in the shop many times in the last 2 years I will admit at first it was a nice car it ran smoothly and would get up and go decently. IT WENT DOWN HILL FROM THERE. Now I don't know what they have done with the new models but hopefully it is more than they did in 99. We have had trouble with the transmission, the timing belt, the computer, the starter for a while there when you would step on it it sounded like it was slamming into the gears and it is an automatic. 

Some of the dash features have also went bad the bass and treble nob is broke and radio channel switches don't work half of the time and don't get me wrong we have treated this car very well. My mom drives like an old lady and my dad is a mechanic thank goodness. 

This vehicle on the other hand gets around pretty well in the snow and does have a good suspension and a very smooth ride on the highway and gets about 22 miles to the gallon.

I don't know maybe it is just this one car but I doubt it this is just my opinion and maybe we have had just bad luck but if you buy a car no matter what it is luck shouldn't have anything to do with it it should just run.
