            Mine has the standard 1.9L SOHC 4 cylinder.  It runs smooth.  It gets about 35 MPG on the highway.  Crankcase holds 4 quarts of 5w-30 oil.  It currently has 104,000 miles on it & does not burn or leak anything.

It has the 5 speed manual transmission.

Only problems were; starting at 30,000 miles the transmission would sometimes pop out of reverse & warranty would not fix it since it did not do it to the mechanic on a test drive & if they were to disassemble it & couldn't find a problem the dealer said that they would have to charge me $600, so I never fixed it.  Alternator shorted out at 85,000 miles & in turn killed the battery with it.  Replaced the front break pads & pully belt for the first time then too.  The plastic parts like the lap belt holder & interior trim broke easily, but I can live with it.  At about 90,000 miles the engine would knock all the time except when at idle & would idle fast (around 1,500 RPM), had to replace a computer temperature sensor located on the back side of the cylinder head.

The brakes on the front are disc & on the rear are drum.

The stock tires were 175/75/R14 & would cost $100 each to replace (because they were hard to find), but I found some Goodyear Viva that were 185/70/R14 for $50 each.

I usually had to replace the air filter once a year for $18 & had to purchase it from a parts store.  But then I bought a K&N lifetime warranty filter for $40.  So after a couple years I will start saving money & without the hassle.

Make sure when you replace/add coolant to the car, only use phosphate free antifreeze.  Just to be safe, buy it from a Saturn dealer only.  According the the owner's manual standard antifreeze that contains phosphate is harmful to the block.
