            This car was the needle in the haystack.  Found when I needed a car the most, it has been a very reliable means of transportation.  Starting on the 3rd turnover everytime, quiet, fuel economical, rides like a dream, and convenient safety design.  Plenty of space for both leg room and head room.  The kids don't have to complain about their area either.  To top it all, plenty of 'wagon' space to carry just about anything.  I have myself used the car to haul most household items (including mattress and boxsprings, washer and dryer for example)you could haul in a truck.  A full size spare tire is conveniently contained beneath a carpeted hard plastic covering beneath the floor board of the wagon. The carpet of the interior still looks like brand new.  Seat covers are hole and wear free.  The only problem I can see with the interior is the covering on the inside roof of the car.  It is sagging with age now and will have to be replaced.  All electronics/electrical gadgets still work.  Granted, amenities are few, but it has enough of what you need.  I have opted to replace the old AM only radio for a newer Optimus bass boosted cassette AM/FM with CD adapter.  Outer appearance of the car is eye catching, with plenty of chrome fixtures and noticeable lighted braking and backups.  Artistically speaking the paint could be better, as it is, yellow or cream/tannish to some isn't beautifying.  Engine performance is an optimum, with good acceleration/engine strength, quiet ride, and gentle shock system.  Virtually maintenance free design, the engineers of now could learn from the manufacturer and designer of the 1985 Plymouth Reliant 'K' car.  A good to go choice in my opinion.  Thumbs up!
