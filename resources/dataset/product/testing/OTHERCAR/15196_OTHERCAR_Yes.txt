                 I was not totally convinced that I wanted a van instead of an SUV.  But when I looked at the safety features, roominess and &quot;people capacity&quot;, not to mention the quality that Toyota stands for, I grudingly gave in to my husband's choice of vehicle.
     We bought our Sienna LE 2000 in late September for a little over $26K, excluding taxes.  Acquiring it at that price and quality was quite a challenge in itself, since it seemed that everyone and his cousin wanted one!
     Since then, I've been very happy with our choice.  The quiet purr of the engine is unexpected when you know that it's got a powerful 6-cylinder under that hood.  The somewhat-SCARY part is that the Sienna  rides so smoothly, that unless you are on cruise control, you could easily hit the high 70's without feeling the speed at which you're going!
     We love the CD player, stereo controls at the driver's wheel, the individual ventilation controls in the back passenger areas, and the cup holders for each passenger (that accommodate different sizes).
     There isn't anything I don't like about the Sienna--however, the quality of customer service varies, depending on which dealership you are forced to deal with.
     I do wish the vans came with a cellular phone feature and palm computers...
