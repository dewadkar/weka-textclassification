            Wow, I love my car.

I bought it on eBay for $910 in Dec. 2001.  It had some minor accident damage which I repaired myself; I still got it for about $700 under market value.  In addition to that, after being rear-ended at about 20-25 mph last weekend, I got a check from their insurance agency for $959.83.  Best part is I can go to a junkyard I know and get everything I need to fix it for about $30 (only the back bumper was damaged!  it's a beast!).  So, technically, this thing owes me nothing.

But for those who might need to acquire one under more normal financial circumstances, let me extoll the virtues of this fine automobile.

Mine's the DX, not the top-of-the-line LE.  However, the only features the LE's got that I don't are plush seats, power mirrors, an optional V6 engine and a moonroof.  My car has power windows with express down on the driver's, central power locking (unlocks everything from the key- NICE!), working cruise control, rear wiper/washer/defroster, tilt, A/C, and mine even came with an aftermarket CD player.  And all these toys work.  But that's not the only reason to seek a Camry Wagon of this vintage.

A big reason I love it is the fact that I consistently get about 28-31 MPG.  This thing will glide down the highway all day long.  I've already taken long trips with it and it inspires nothing but confidence.  The automatic seat belts took some getting used to but I've come to like them- one less thing to think about.  This car does a lot of stuff for you.  It even shuts your lights off automatically.  I also really like the low dashboard and thin windshield pillars- this car has outstanding forward visibility, unlike the boxed-in feeling of most new cars.  And you wouldn't think it, but it handles like a much smaller car.  Not wallowy or boat-like in any way you'd expect an American station wagon to be.  I can throw this thing around in rain and snow with confidence!

Also, there isn't a single object I own that I can't fit inside this car.  It won't take everything at once, but nothing short of a U-haul could pull that off.  I collect mid-century modern furniture.  I once fit a knockoff Eames lounge chair and three Lucite table chairs in it with enough room for three people left over.  It passes the giant-console-television test, albeit only with both halves of the 60/40 split rear seat folded flat.  (I consider the ability to haul one of those huge old wood-console TV's you often see on the side of the road a mark of excellence for vehicle cargo capacity)  This car is a true companion on thrift store runs.  Oh, so much space!  With the backseat folded flat, you can sleep two in it comfortably with the hatch closed.  The only thing my car lacks to make its cargo carrying potential fully realized is a luggage rack.  And maybe a trailer hitch...

Besides, I like the styling.  It's got chrome door handles and chrome trim around the windows, and that makes the primate-who-likes-shiny-things in me happy.  Mine's a real nice dark blue metallic- definitely the BEST color on this car, and it just exudes class.

Mechanically, all I've replaced are an exhaust pipe (they tend to rust on these cars every 40k, for some reason) and a CV boot.  I'm a little concerned about the starter drive gear.  Every once in a while, it makes a grinding noise when you turn the key.  Supposedly they made the starter stronger than the drive gear, which can chip teeth.  Once it's totally stripped, it's a fairly costly fix- possibly $1,000 at a dealer.  But this is important to note- TOYOTA DEALERS SUCK.  Most often than not, you can have the work done elsewhere for at least half and down to a third of what the Dealers want.  However, it seems to be holding up quite nicely.  Otherwise, this car simply has no disconcerting quirks...everything works better than you think it would.  The brakes on this sucker could stop the world...four stars!  

I bought this car from the original owner, a college professor, and he included every receipt (save for gas) ever associated with the car.  I have its complete repair history for every one of its 167,600 miles.  I even have the window sticker, and this was, like, a $15,000 car in 1988.  And I bought it for $910.

I consider myself one of the cheapest bastards to ever walk the face of the earth, and this car is quite frankly my ideal auto.  Toyota reliability, station wagon space, and the comfort of buying a 14-year-old car that has already bottomed out on depreciation.  Try not to pay over $2000 for one.  This is how to buy a car!  It's actually worth well over what I paid for it, and still will be years from now...how many car owners can say that?

As an endnote, the day we drove to Madison to pick it up, we were listening to CarTalk on NPR.  Some guy called in and asked about how to keep his 1988 Camry, with 307,000 MILES ON IT, running well.  Click and Clack told him to just keep doing what he's doing, because the Toyota Camry certainly will do over 300k with just routine maintenance.

In short, I plan to have this car the rest of my life.  It is that good.
