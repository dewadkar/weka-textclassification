            I bought my neon in 1995 used with under 10,000 miles on the odometer.  The original owner bought the car in April of 1994 (via a car reporting service) and showed no problems.  Within one week the car had me stranded on the side of the road late at night.  The dealer fixed it but I was never sure exactly what happened.

Well, I figured one problem is not too bad and for a while things were ok.  At about 30,000 miles however my car started burning oil.  I have not bothered to fix it as many other problems have crept up at about the same time.  The paint on the roof has started to chip.  I have quasi fixed it with clear coat but it detracts from the look of the car.  The rear tail light collects water like Santa likes cookies.  I literally have to empty the tail light every couple of months so that I do not burn out the lights.  

I have a new problem that I'm not sure how to categorize.  I have gotten into the car and the radio has not played for several minutes.  I know that it is electrical but I have checked the fuse and all is ok with it.  

This car is not a good purchase unless you are very handy and like a challenge.
