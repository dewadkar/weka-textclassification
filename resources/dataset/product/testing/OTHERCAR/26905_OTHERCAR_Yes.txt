            Perhaps Toyota doesn't have the style or power of it's American-made cousins, but there's one thing that you can count on with a Toyota: dependability. My family is the proud owner of 3 Toyota Camry's in a row, and each one proved superior in quality to anything American. We drive ours vehicles pretty hard, but the Camry has always been up to the challenge. 165 K on the first, 190 K on the second, and a whopping 204 K on our last. Unfortunantly we deviated from our Camry tradition and now drive a '98 Accord. Although a decent car, we all miss our beloved little Camry. The Camry may not be able to beat a Taurus or Grand Prix in a drag race, but it'll leave them behind in the shop when their transmissions go out. Yep, the Camry is an excellent buy for those with some money to spend, but would rather spend it on the car, not repairs.<br><br>
