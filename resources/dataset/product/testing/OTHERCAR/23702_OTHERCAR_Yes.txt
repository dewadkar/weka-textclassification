            We have had numerous Astros/Safaris on our carlot over the time we've been in business.  We have had excellent luck with these mini vans, with very few customer-returns for problems with these vans.  These vans come equipped standard with the world-renouned 4.3 Liter V-6 Engine, and the excellent 700R-4 transmission, which is almost an indestructable combination for the powertrain.  We have had some of these vans, with miles in excess of 400,000 miles, and most still run very strong.  The only bad thing about the 4.3 V-6, is the fact that most of them built prior to 1993, smoke when they're fist started up, but they still hold an ample amount of oil pressure.  This is not a life-threatening problem for this engine, it will run well over 300,000 miles with this condition.  It is a relatively expensive problem to have fixed, especially at the Dealer, but there's no need to fix it, unless it really bothers you. This is the only bad thing I have to say about the 4.3 V-6 engine, produced by General Motors.  Because these vans are almost as heavy as the "full" sized vans that GM produces, the fuel mileage is better than that of a V-8 powered full sized van, but the fuel mileage the Astro/Safari vans get, is considerably less than it's competitor's.  But, on the flip side, you also cannot pull a 6,000 pound trailer/boat with the competitor's vans, either.  These vans are very difficult for the handicapped, or the physically challanged to get into.  There is a fairly limited amount of room in the front seats, even with the front seats set all the way back, and alot of that is due to the fact, that the front wheel wells come into the passenger area of the vehicle.  As for the Astro/Safari's driveability, handling, and comfort...  These vans generally handle well on any road, and in most types of weather conditions.  The 2WD models do not get around well in ice or snow, and do not stop well in these conditions, but the AWD models are unsurpassed in literally all types of conditions.  The handling of these vans is great, and on most any type of roadway.  The wind does not push these vans around too badly, nor does the wind coming off of other vehicles on the interstate.  The comfort level is unsurpassed, the seats provide an ample amount of lumbar support, and for the driver, all of the controls are in very convient places, as well as the gauge cluster.  These vans ride very nice, the EXT Model rides a little better than the "short" version, but all in all, they both ride very nice, for a rear wheel drive van.  The amount of cargo or storage space is more than ample, and is way more than enough in the EXT Models of these vans.  There is plenty of leg room, and head room is more than ample.  The digital display dash that is available on these vans, is very reliable (for those of you who may be wondering), and I've never seen one of these digital displays fail as of yet.  I have been just simply impressed with the appearance, performance, reliability, and longevity of these vans.  I would recommend anyone that would ask me, to go ahead and purchase one.
