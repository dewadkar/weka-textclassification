            I have not purchased this but I'm going to.

I bought a 1987 S10 blazer in 1998 because I had a child and wanted a truck, but couldn't afford one, so I got the next best thing.

 	I love this S10. It is a great work truck and it can go into the woods for that weekend fishing trip or what ever. 

My S10 has a 3"body lift on it. I paid about 150.00 for the lift and then put 31/10.50/15" tires on it and some dress up things like black outs and so on.

 The S10's have lots of goodies that can be added if that's what you like. I think that it is the best 4x4 that I have ever had and I'm going to buy another one, but this is my opinion.

 Allot of people think the opposite. You will either love it or you will hate it.

 	The thing I hate about the S10 is that there are a lot of bad ones out there, mostly the 2.8L. They are known for losing the engine at 100,000 miles. I would not recommend buying one without having someone thoroughly check it out, if possible buy a mechanic you trust. 

 I will tell you if you have any doubt, don�t buy it because there are so many of them for sale that it would be worth waiting for the right one. Another thing that I hate is that if you want a suspension lift on your 4x4 S10 it is going to cost you in the range of 1000.00 to 5000.00 for 2� to 6�of lift. I would love to have one, but it is so costly.

 In case you were wondering, the '87 I own has never been to the shop I do all my own work.

   	Whether you are going for a long ride or not it will give you a good ride as long as you keep up on maintanance like the oil, spark plugs, it is also a good idea to get some good shocks for the best ride, well worth getting.

  	 If you are looking for a good work truck then this is a good buy for you. If you live in the city it might not be for you.
