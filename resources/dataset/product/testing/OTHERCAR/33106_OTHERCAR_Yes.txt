            This vehicle is great.  My mom bought the car new and kept it for two years and gave it to me on my 16th birthday.  The car runs excellent.  The jimmy has more than enough space for my stuff and my friends stuff.  The cargo area has tons and tons of room.  The Jimmy also gets good gas mileage, about 23-27 miles per gallon.  That's good for people that are on a budget.  This is a great car for families of 3 or 4.  The Jimmy can seat five comfortably.  The back seat folds down turning into a bigger cargo area or a make shift bed that is sort of comfortable.  <br><br>
