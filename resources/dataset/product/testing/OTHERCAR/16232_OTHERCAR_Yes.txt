            Car: 1999 Corolla CE. Automatic(3+1), Power everything, Alarm and Remote Locks

My car until last year was a 1987 Dodge Shadow.  For those of you who have driven them, they don't break.  I had 125000 miles and the only reason I gave it up was cause it was totaled.  But this is about the Toyota Corolla.  I wanted a car as dependable, new, compact, and inexpensive.

I used the web to research the cars I was interested in. I limited myself to the other side of the pacific.  Since I wanted inexpensive, most European cars were out, and dependability rules out most American cars.  Toyota had the best price for what you get.  

My most recent excursion took it on a 12 mile unimproved road and it handled well.  It was covered in dirt, but as long as I avoided large rocks I had no trouble.  It handled well on loose gravel and I never felt I was close to losing control.

Mechanics: 

Good: The Corolla handles very nicely.  It has get up and go when you need it, its not a sports car(duh), but since its light and has a good engine, it can accelerate.  It has a great turning radius.  On highway (and commutes) I routinely get between 32-35 mpg.

Bad: The engine is very tight.  Since I like to do some routine maintenance on my own I find it very difficult to change the oil.  The oil filter is in a very inconvenient place, and its always to tight to get off by hand.  

Interior:

Good:  Plenty of room for me.  My friend who is 6'6&quot; can easily sit in the passenger's seat.  The back seat is a little tight, but I have had four adults in the car and they aren't too cramped.  The trunk is very spacious, and the fold down seat allowed me to move a futton (though the frame was mostly taken apart).  I recently drove from MO to WA in four days.  I was never uncomfortable in the car. 

Bad:  Light interior shows dirt.  Also I miss having a tachometer.  The cup holder is right at knee level for me.  So when cruise is engaged and I relax my leg, my knee always goes into the corner of the cup holder.

Service:

Good:  None

Bad:  The only two times I have been to a Toyota service I have been displeased.  The first time was the first time I was changing my oil.  I had already changed it but couldn't get the oil filter off.  I went into the service department to ask them to loosen it.  They first insisted I would have to pay $15, then brought it down to only $8.  I considered this would take less than a minute.  Even the owner seemed disinterested in helping me, so no more service from them.

The second time I went to change my oil while on vacation.  They only had 10W30.  The Corolla is specified to use 5W30.  While they were kind enough, I was annoyed by the lack of parts.

Service has always been a problem of Toyota's

Overall I think its a great car, just don't plan on Toyota service centers being of much help.<br><br>
