            The interior of the 1997 Jaguar XK8 Convertible is opulent with its walnut instrument panel, leather-trimmed woodrim steering wheel and leather interior. It's also fairly roomy up front with comfortable seats. The rear seats are another story - the XK8's rear seat area is essentially a nicely upholstered parcel shelf. However the XK8 isn't about passenger capacity. It's about fast elegance. 

The XK8 has the AJ-V8 engine - aluminum block and heads, dual overhead camshafts, four valves per cylinder, varible cam phasing, 290 horsepower, 284 pound-feet of torque. The AJ-V8 delivers enough punch to propel this classy car to 60 mph in less than seven seconds. It takes just over 17 seconds to reach 100 mph, and top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph.

Aside from that, though, the XK8 ranks as one of the best-looking cars on the road. However the XK8 clearly belongs to the realm of high disposable income.
