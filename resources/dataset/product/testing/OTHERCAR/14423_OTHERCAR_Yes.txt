            LOOKING to buy a vehicle? Here's the best buy for your money. I purchased a 1997 DODGE DAKOTA back when they first came out. This was a mistake, because you should never buy a first year vehicle.Had some minor problems(bugs), but they were taken care of promptly. After all bugs were gone this little truck was a charm. It rides,drives, and handles quite well. This truck is not made for a lot of heavy hauling. It's basically a pleasure truck in my opinion.It is great to drive on the highway. The first month I had it the wife and I went on a trip(ABOUT 700 MILES). It was a pleasure to not only ride but to drive this truck on the highway. It is very sound proof, and gets about 23 mpg on the highway. I purchased my vehicle with the V6 engine which is the best size for this truck(LIGHT REAREND). The V8 is available but  is too much engine for this size truck. I have personally seen what the truck will do with the V8, it will get away from even the most experienced drivers, so stick with the V6 if you purchase .There are some great colors available but none look good unless you purchase with black trim, not chrome.So all I can say now is enjoy if you buy,because that is what I'm doing now.<br><br>
