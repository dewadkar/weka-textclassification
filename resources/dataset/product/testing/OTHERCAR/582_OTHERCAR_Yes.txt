            AT stop lights, the guys next to me will look over and say - what a cool truck.  We bought it new as our second vehicle to the family car; ordered it with the special features we wanted.  Five speed manual transmission, which is lots of fun to drive. 
It's sporty, yet very comfortable.  Lots of room in front; we got the jump seats, so a it's only for kids or smaller people, but it gives that 'extra' amount of room that is really handy.
The air conditioning will freeze you out.  The radio and sound is great; sorry we didn't get a CD player then.  
The engine is very responsive; changing to four-wheel drive is as easy as flipping a switch.  It's a good when you're in the mud and need to get back on the road!
After five years, it's never been in the shop for any repairs and it's even got the original battery.  Since we have other vehicles in the family, it's only got 40,000 miles on it.  But it does go to work every day and is the 'hunting' truck. So it sees a real variety of driving.
Who knows how long we'll keep it -- at least 100,000, I would guess.
If you want a good truck and you find a used 1995 b4000, you'd be making a good buy.
