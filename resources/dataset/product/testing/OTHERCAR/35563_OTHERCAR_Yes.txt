            I�ve never had a brand new car. I�ve owned 3 cars in the past and they were all used when I got them and American. I have gained a reputation of being tough on cars but even if I hadn�t been tough on these cars, they would have still fallen apart. It seemed like every other week something else went wrong.

So after my Cavalier hit 97,000 miles, I decided it was time for a new car�.. a BRAND NEW CAR. I wanted to go foreign and looked around at the options. Foreign cards seem to run a higher price tag than domestic cars, but it was something I was willing to pay. I needed quality. I needed endurance. I needed to make it to 100,000 miles with no repairs. 

I decided that the Honda Civic EX was going to get me that.

I didn�t do much research. I basically went around to about 5 different car lost  and looked at the stickers and made my decision from there. Toyotas seemed nice, but the Hondas were more reasonably priced. I went to St. Louis Honda on a Sunday to avoid salesmen and really scoped it out. I found a red (I had to have red) Honda Civic EX that had everything I wanted.  

All my past cars have had nothing. This had a power moon roof, power locks, cruise control, POWER MIRRORS ( I think those are the coolest), and a 6 speaker sound system with a CD player. Those were all the requirements I was looking for. Plus the price tag was under $18,000. I had to get this car. 

I went to the dealer on Monday, took it for a test drive and I was hooked. It handled great, low road noise, and had a really comfortable feel. I went in, traded in the Cavalier and left in my new Civic.

I�ve had it for about 4 months now and I have no major complaints. Everything still runs smooth and the air conditioning works great. It takes about 2 minutes to get cool air on a hot day but compared to my past vehicles, this is record speed.  The back seat is cool because it doesn�t have that middle hump and the entire floor is one height. The trunk is really big and I have no problem fitting all my stuff into it.  

Actually, that could be a complaint. The trunk is so big that my stuff slides from side to side when I take the turns too hard. I guess I should utilize that cargo net a little more.  I guess if I needed to pick another negative, I could say something about the remote keyless entry. It seems like you have to be pretty close to the car for it to unlock your doors. I also wish you could set the remote so it would open both doors with one click instead of having to click it twice to open the passenger door as well. 

I have put 7000 miles on it so far and it still runs like it was brand new. The moon roof has a small rattle now, but my subdivision roads are so crappy that this has to be expected from any vehicle I own. Gas mileage is about 33MPG.. I keep track on a regular basis.  

I am extremely happy with my Civic. It doesn�t look like a compact car compared to the Focus or Neon. It stands out from the rest of the compact car market.
