            In October of 1999 my best friend purchased a 1995 Hyundai Scoupe from a local GM Used car dealership.  Well, one day in late January 2000, I borrowed my friends� car.  I began to cross a busy intersection when a woman driving a Toyota 4-Runner (Blinded by the sun) drove over the car, crushing the roof of the car.  The woman ramped over the car, and landed upside down numerous feet away.  Because of the manor that the seatbelt is attached to the door, when the door opened, my head was pulled outside with it.  
Recap--Door opens due to crushing of roof, seatbelt attached to door pulls head outside.
I narrowly escaped death that day, however I did not escape unscathed.  I lost a 2� by 4� piece of my scalp.  Because of the lack of safety features included in this inexpensive import, I nearly lost my life.  No airbag, inferior seatbelts, thin body, and poor design are to blame for the seriousness of this accident.  

If this seatbelt would not have been attached to the door, I would have been able to escape uninjured, but as are result of their inferior design, I suffered severe head trauma, resulting in memory loss, which will affect my life indefinitely. 

Please don�t make the mistake I did.
