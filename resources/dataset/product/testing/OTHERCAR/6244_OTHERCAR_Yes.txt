               The Nissan Frontier four door truck is one of the ugliest trucks that I have ever seen. It looks like someone stoped its grow before the bed could get bigger. Though it has a bad apearance, the handling and versatility of it is incredible. The design of the truck gives you the best of both the sport utility and truck advantages in one vehicle.  Though this is a great design I would advise going to look at the other compact  four door trucks offered by ford and dodge. I bought one for my son and he loves it. The versatility is the best on the market.<br><br>
