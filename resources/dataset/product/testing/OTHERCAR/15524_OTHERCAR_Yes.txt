            I leased my convertible in August of 1999.  I have the JXI model which includes the leather, upgraded stereo, upgraded wheels, canvas top.

I have taken this car in 3 times for repairs under its bumper to bumper warranty.  The forward dash had cracked, the suspension had lost it lubrication and therefore creaked at any bump, and the passenger side door controls became dislodged from the door.

What I like about this car.  I was looking for a reasonably priced convertible that could fit 4 adults comfortably without the folks in the back seat being shoe horned in.  I have actually carried 3 in the back seat although not designed for this.   I have never had any complaints about the room from the back seat.  I have even ridden in the back myself with another adult and can say it was comfortable and roomy.  The other thing I like about this car is that it rides very smooth.  It has a wonderful large sedan car ride about it.  The trunk is huge.  We can fit 2 small and 2 large suitcases in the trunk.  I appreciate the appointments in the car.  All of the functions are near by and easy to address except for the radio.  The upgraded stereo sounds wonderful and very powerful, if you look under the passenger seat you will actually find a stereo amp.  The leather is holding up well, and I just treat it every 6 months with leather cleaner.  The top is easy to put back and forth.  I really like the wheels on this particular year of car.  They are classy yet sporty.

Things I wish were different.  When hitting a bump, although the car rides smoothly, the upper portion of the car can vibrate.    I have also had to replace a few of the internal plastic parts.  Although I think with any new car, you can expect to have 1 or 2 things not up to par.  Lastly, this car has a history of loosing it lubrication in the front end at around the 25-30k mile range.  Although not a detriment to the car I was told, it does get a little noisy but can easily be fixed with a little grease. 

When my lease is up, I will be purchasing this car.  A good friend just bought one for his wife, and I know several other friends that are looking to get one soon.   That should say a lot about the car.
