            Our family had an 87 Chevy Blazer S-10 sport with just about all the options. It had A/C, sunroof, 4-wheel drive, and these cool little pouches everywhere to stuff things.  Anyway, we had it for about a year, and the transmission went out.  The dealer told us that the automatic transmissions were not very good, and they were notorious for failing.  We spent $1200 replacing it.  A few months later the radiator fluid leaked into the engine because of a cracked block.  We then went so far as to replace the engine!  We thought we had ourselves a working reliable vehicle after that.  Then the transmission went out again.  

The poor vehicle, unable to reach speeds over 35mph, now lies with a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign in the window.   <br><br>
