            I've researched trucks online for many months and I've finally settled on the Nissan Frontier because, A) Honda doesn't make a truck yet, B) Toyota's are expensive and every option is extra.  

I looked hard at American trucks, the RAM was impressive, but I was worried about their service history.  I wouldn't touch the Chevy's with a 10 foot pole(Road to Redemption is their new ad campaign, look up redemption in the dictionary).  Ford is... well Ford.  I have owned a Ford Ranger for a number of years as a second vehicle, and I would recommend the Ford to anyone.  It was a sturdy little truck, however everything fell apart around 150,000 miles.


I've owned a Nissan 300ZX for 16 years, and honestly if you take care of a Nissan engine (oil changes, timing belt...)they will run for 300,000 miles easily.  Plus their paint topcoats seem to withstand the test of time.

So after many searches, I purchased a used 2000 XE V6 Automatic 2WD CrewCab (Silver)w/ 52K miles.  I thought I worked a pretty good deal and the truck was in great shape.  No scratches, dings, or paint chips.  According to Carfax no wrecks and one owner.  

I did test drive the king cabs, but I liked the Crew Cab because it felt more like an SUV ride, very sturdy and equally distributed front to rear weight ratio.  The Crew Cabs also sit higher than regular or king cabs.  10.2" ground clearance.

Even with a V6 don't expect to race around town or peel out much.  The engine has good torque and 'highway horsepower', but 0-60 your not going to beat anyone.  I've been averaging 17.6 mpg with regular unleaded.  The tanks takes a surprising 19.75 gallons to fill up.

Options: My XE model came with PW/PS/PL/3 Disc changer/AM-FM radio with Tape/tinted windows/sliding rear window/ chrome bumpers/tow package/cruise control/AC/Bedliner(Factory)/Power Mirrors/Bug Deflector(aftermarket)/Cloth seats/Four Wheel Disc brakes/Alloys...  The reason I really liked this truck is because the original owner kept it all factory.  But I'm not...

I also like the front ends on the 1999 and 2000 models.  Nissan did a redesign for 2001 and made the new front ends all plastic.  To me a truck without some chrome isn't a truck.

Bottom line, I test drove the Dodge RAM 1500, Ford F150, Toyota Tacoma PreRunner, Toyota Tundra(Nice truck!), and the GMC Sierra.  For the money, I think my Nissan will outlast them all, except maybe the Toyota's, but remember I said "for the money".  

If you can find a good used XE or SE crew cab 1999 or 2000 model and your so inclined, go for it.  It's a smooth consistent ride, with defined styling, and good power.  Hey at least it was assembled in the USA.
