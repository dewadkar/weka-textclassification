            1999 VW New Beetle Review

In the spring of 1998, VW introduced the New Beetle to the North American market. Immediately, my wife wanted one. She drove an original Beetle when she was a teenager and had fond memories of the car.  I, too, had a brief fling with the original Bug when I was a kid in California &#150 mine was a white, 1965 Beetle that someone had added the Baja kit to. Since it ran on a 6-volt battery, I found myself stranded more times than I care to count.

The wife&#146s desire increased when one of our son&#146s friend&#146s parents bought a red 1998 New Beetle, 5-speed with the gas engine. We had a chance to drive it briefly and it just solidified my wife&#146s decision. When our existing lease had 2 months left, we started looking in earnest. The local VW dealer was not following the standard practice (at the time) of adding thousands of dollars in &#147Additional Dealer Markup&#148, but they were adding lots of dealer-installed accessories to bump up their profit.

The wife&#146s color desire ran from yellow to green. Since I would be driving the car a good part of the time, I suggested that perhaps a less, um, &#147noticeable&#148 color might be better. We agreed upon the bright blue. The dealer had one coming in the following week &#150 it was the GL model, 5-speed with the gas engine. Perfect!  The only &#147accessories&#148 we added were window tinting, a clear bra and the installation of a 6-CD changer in the trunk.

We took delivery on the first Saturday of December 1998. Our ownership &#147honeymoon&#148 lasted exactly one week, as the &#147Check Engine&#148 light came on. Back to the dealership, where we were told that the O2 sensor had failed. They originally told us that it might take several weeks to get the part in, which made the spouse less than happy. Fortunately, the next day the dealer called to tell us that the part had arrived and that we could pick it up at the end of the day. This would not be the first time our dealer went above and beyond the call of duty to keep us happy.

Almost 5 years later, we still have our &#147Beauty&#148. She has just over 54,000 miles on her, and the wife still drives her back and forth to work. She still looks pretty good, with only a couple of minor &#147kisses&#148 on the passenger door to remind us that she&#146s not brand new (note to parents: do not let your kids park their bikes next to the new car without using the kick stands). Our son, who was 12 when we acquired her, is now 17 and drives the car occasionally to and from work. The plan is to sell it to him next year when he turns 18.

<b>Ownership Experiences and Driving Impressions</b>

I will admit to being a bit concerned about VW&#146s reliability when we got the car. Five years down the road, I can say that I have been pleasantly surprised at how reliable &#147Beauty&#148 has been. No, it&#146s not been a perfect relationship &#150 the following list of troubles can attest to that:

�	O2 sensor needed replacement
�	A/C gasket failed &#150 no cold air. Replaced.
�	Power mirror switch broken by wife&#146s friend who didn&#146t know how it operated. Repaired.
�	Belly pan damaged by driving in (too much) snow. Replaced.

Fortunately, the GL model did not have the power windows, so we were spared that particular malady. Another early production problem was a persistent rattle in the hatchback. We avoided that, too. New tires at about 28,000 miles were needed (not sure if it was just the OEM Goodyear&#146s wearing quickly or the aggressive driving), and all services, save the last couple of oil changes have been done by the dealer.

One very nice thing about the Beetle is its adjustability to drivers of all shapes and sizes. The height adjustable seats, coupled with the tilt and telescoping steering wheel, means that both my 5&#1463&#148 wife and my 5&#14611&#148 body could get comfortable. Visibility is not stellar, however &#150 I have struggled for 5 years to deal with the blind spot over my shoulders, while the wife has had persistent problems in seeing around the thick A-pillar. You just gotta look carefully where you&#146re going, especially when you are changing lanes.

The seats, like those in most German cars, are firm. Nice for short trips but I&#146m not sure that I&#146d want to drive it cross-country (that, and the lack of cruise control on the GL model). In fact, the furthest trip I think we&#146ve taken it is about 80 miles, which we did about 3 weeks after we got it.

As I mentioned earlier, we&#146ve got a teenager at home. In fact, we have two. Trust me, this is not a car you want to try to put 4 people into comfortably. Anyone over about 5&#1467&#148 will likely bump his or her head on the roof in the rear seat. Legroom is also at a premium in back. The lucky folks up front do not have the same problem. As a matter of fact, I cannot reach the pedals if I push the front seat all the way back.

The best part about the New Beetle is driving it. No, it&#146s not a dragster &#150 115 horsepower in a car weighing close to 2800 pounds does not make for lightning quick getaways. But, with the 5-speed, it can be a joy to drive nonetheless. My wife frequently comments about how she&#146ll look down at the speedometer and find that she&#146s doing 65 or 70 in a 55 zone. Part of this is due, I suspect, to the short gearing &#150 on the highway, 80MPH translates to 4000 RPM&#146s in 5th gear. So, it&#146s kinda noisy from the engine compartment. The engine never seems like it&#146s breathing hard, even though we live at 6000&#146. For those people used to the &#147snick, snick&#148 of a Japanese gearshift, the New Beetles&#146 shifter is going to come as a bit of a shock. It demands precise movement, and feels heavy to the touch. Satisfying, if that is your thing.

Handling? Quite nice, if I do say so myself. With 16&#148 low profile rubber and a low center of gravity, the Beetle goes around corners as if it were stuck to the road. The downside is a rough ride &#150 it won&#146t fool anyone into thinking it&#146s a Cadillac, much less a Camry.

The utility of the car is about a C. The small back seat contributes to this, as does the fact that it only has 2 seat belts in the rear. The trunk area with the rear seat up isn&#146t awful, but the shape is awkward and the CD changer takes up some space. We&#146ve only had the rear seat folded forward a handful of times, but it totally transforms the rear cargo area. Remove the trunk shade and there is quite a bit of room for golf clubs, large boxes and other items.

The interior is, to me, a work of art. I&#146m not sure there is a straight line on the dash anywhere &#150 everything has a curve to it. The blue dashboard lighting at night is cool and calming. I do miss a temperature gauge, though &#150 the Beetle only has a light that indicates when the car is cold. The stereo is loud enough, the A/C blows cold air instantly, it heats up quickly in the winter &#150 what more could one want?

Overall, I&#146ve been very pleased with our &#147Beauty&#148. No, it&#146s not a family car, but rather a perfect size for a single person or a young couple. Unique to look at, fun to drive, economical (we&#146ve seen up to 31mpg on the highway, and probably 25-27mpg normally), the New Beetle is a modern interpretation of the car that most folks remember fondly.
