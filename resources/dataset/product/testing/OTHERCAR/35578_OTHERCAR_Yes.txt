            Honda.  Just about exciting as a heap of soggy clothes in the washer.  Where's the adrenaline rush?  Where's the testestrone?  Where are all the screaming perky college co-eds spilling out of their car windows when they see you drive past by?  

These were my primary concerns when I started searching for a new car to replace the totaled Miata by an anonymous hit and run driver still being sought after by the LAPD.  (S/he deserves to be locked up and their personal domains tickled with various tubular veggies by amorous inmates, that git.)  

Yes, the most important factor in selecting a new car was that sex appeal.  The downside of it was that I only could pay $10k to $15k for a new mode of transportation.  Begrudgingly, I crossed off the Mitsubishi Eclipse and the Chrysler PT Cruiser.  That left me with the VW Beetle, a horse-drawn buggy, and this, this Honda vehicle with a pristine reputation as an efficient people mover.  

Off to the Honda dealer!  My heart was set on the German People's Wagon ever since a customer of mine offered to give me a lift out to lunch a few months ago so I figured that at least I could claim to have made an effort to be...what's that word...oh yes, "PRACTICAL".  The disaster with the unsalvageable Miata had left me limp, apathetic to all other cars.  The African American salesman at the local branch of the Honda empire was particularly helpful, if not a bit misinformed when it came to the mechanical components of the Civic DX when we went for a test drive.  Mind you, I only wanted a slat with four wheels in working condition. However, at some point in the 1 mile course, a question occurred in my head, 'Does his face get pale every time he takes someone else for a test drive?'

Another thought popped in my head whilst turning around a block corner at 35mph.  'Hey Sid, this car handles tight curbs surprisingly well.  Not too shabby.'  If you've ever been a fan of Super Mario racing, you'll recognize that Princess Toadstool has the speed akin that of a Corvette and Donkey Kong has the maneuverability of a lunkerjob like a SUV.  Traffic lanes being the ideal location to open a roadside barbeque or Mexican peeled fruit concession stand, there is no need for speed or all-terrain bulk here in LA.  Besides, I've always opted for Luigi who had the best handling, and viola, I was enjoying the ride.  

After contemplating for a few more days, I went back and sullenly signed my life away on the yellow contract.  My heart was broken and the best way to mend it was to get even.  With better fuel efficiency at 29/38 miles on the gallon.  With 121 or so horsepower.  With spacey interior and sporty styling.  I should mention something about aerodynamics but don't know how to sound convincing enough.  

The real surprise came as I drove home.  The machine zipped though the 110 freeway, weaving in and out of lanes, at a top speed of 80mph (at which subtle complaints emanated from under the hood), enabling me to flick off people who I will never see again.  Close to the ground, the Civic's brakes are phenomenally responsive like any two-seater roadster.  Faithfully, the Civic yielded to all my temperamental inclinations devised to torture it to its limit.  

To top it off, there is that 10,000 mile maintenence free warranty, which was not a crucial factor in selecting the Civic, but it sure feels good to know that I needn't bother with the oil change and tune up and all other grease monkey business for a long time.     

There's one minor feature I dislike about the 2001 Civic. The factory installed AM/FM Cassette, while serviceable, looks like it should come equipped with a magnifying glass.  The buttons are puny and it's as appealing as your great-aunt's used microwave oven.  The speakers can handle something conservative like Madonna or Kenny G, but I wouldn't dare anything over 79 decibels.

For your perusal, here's the financial aspect.
