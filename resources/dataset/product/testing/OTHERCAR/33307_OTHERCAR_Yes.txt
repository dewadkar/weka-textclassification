            After my 1995 Subaru Legacy wagon was stolen, I wanted another. It had been a great car, but this was 1998. The Forester, I thought, would be a second-best solution, but now I don't know how I could have lived without it. I love the way it handles, it has an extremely comfortable interior, and you get most of the benefits of an SUV without the bulky size and gas-guzzling properties. I get about thirty miles per gallon, more or less, depending on how I'm driving. It handles very well on snow and ice, as I'm finding out this winter. I think the automatic all-wheel drive has saved my life more than once, and it has NEVER failed to start immediately, even in sub-zero weather. This car is ideal for families, couples, or singles. It seats five people comfortably.<br><br>
