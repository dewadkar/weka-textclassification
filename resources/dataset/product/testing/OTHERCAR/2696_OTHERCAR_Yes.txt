            Okay, so I finally broke down and bought a digital camera. I did my shopping around, and checked Epinions for feedback about digital cameras. I decided that the Agfa 1680LE was the camera that would suit my needs. After receiving the camera (I bought it through Ubid.com), I have been completely happy with it. 

Being new to using a digital camera, I was a bit nervous. Well, I am happy to say that the 1680LE is a very simple to operate camera and very user friendly. The instruction book is easy to understand and the prompts on the menu (which is a scroll-type), are pretty intuitive. I was up and running in about 10 minutes.

The quality of the pictures is excellent. Crisp photos with great color. I couldn't believe how well this camera takes pictures. Plus, if you happen to take a bad picture, no problem, delete it (which, like using the camera, is very simple). 

Now the problems, which aren't major at all, just quirks that I have. As with all digital cameras, the 1680LE eats batteries, big time. One of the first things I did (after going through a set of batteries) was to buy a charger and extra batteries. Trust me, spend the money up front, buy a charger and save yourself some money. The other complaint (and again, a minor one), is that it takes about a second or two after you push the button to take the picture before the camera &quot;captures&quot; it. The solution? Have your subjects stay still. 

As for the software that Agfa supplies (Photowise), it makes it really easy to upload images from the camera. It does take quite a while for images to be uploaded (especially if you have a full disk of them), so be patient. A solution to this would be to get a card reader as they upload the pictures up to 30 times faster (or so the advertising states).

Overall, this is a great camera for any level of user. I'm extremely happy with it and glad I spent the extra money to get extra features (zoom, tilt lens, high resolution) as I will have this camera for a long time. If you are thinking about digital camera, look no further than the Agfa 1680LE. <br><br>
