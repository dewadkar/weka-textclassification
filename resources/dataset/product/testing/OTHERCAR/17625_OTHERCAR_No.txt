Great Size
Easy to Download Pictures
Easy to use
All the features of a bigger camera
Quick seek times

Dislikes:
Battery recharges in absolutely no time
No way to permanently disable LCD at start-up
Very sensitive to unstable shooting
Awful night-shooting
No way to stop the exposure from auto adjusting in low-lux shooting.
Atrocious color reproduction unless your shot is just perfect.
Annoying/Constant focus adjustments by the camera - noisy as well.
LCD is way too small and does not accurately display images.

All the accessories are there, but I find that I'm having to constantly reshoot the last picture because the camera didn't get it just right.  I have had a Canon A50 and it (IMHO) was 10X better at almost everything (except the slow picture upload via Serial Cable).  I really dislike this camera and feel that the biggest drawback is the non-accurate depiction of the colors.  I wouldn't mind if the colors were too soft or too hard, but in actuality, the colors are OFF.  Creams turn into tans, purple turns into blue and the other way around, edge detection is too sharp in some places and not sharp enough in others.

I think the Canon Elph S110 and the Fuji CoolPix 775 are a better value, though a little more expensive.
