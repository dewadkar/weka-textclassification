            My mother has owned a Buick LeSabre for about a year now and wow what a car.  Driving a Buick LeSabre is like gliding on air.  If you like comfortable rides with no bumps or squeaks this is the vehicle to get!  I never thought that as a young adult I'd like to cruise around in a Buick especially a LeSabre but once you take it for a spin you feel how relaxing it really is! Fully loaded, leather interior, larger size car that's a great investment for any size family!  The Buick LeSabre is a fairly priced car with all the extras.  Who could ask for anything more?  If you want to enjoy those long trips driving to work, running errands, driving to your vacation destination in style and comfort opt for a LaSabre you won't be undersold!   <br><br>
