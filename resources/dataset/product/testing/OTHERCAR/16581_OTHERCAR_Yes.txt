            We've had our 2001 MPV for about 3 months, and we've completed one 3500 mile family excursion. My initial impression has been sustained. This vehicle is overall about 80-90% as good as the industry-leading Honda Odyssey. If you want a slightly smaller van (the Odyssey is too large for small garages and is a bit big for tight city parking), or if you can get a good price, the MPV is a reasonable choice.

We bought the MPV because we got a VERY good price (due to a special program my former employer had with Ford/Mazda) and the advantages of the smaller length outweighed the loss of cargo space (compared to the Odyssey).

We have not found the vehicle to be underpowered for our uses, but I wouldn't try towing anything big with it.

Things we like:

1. In general it's a basic functional van. We like the way the middle windows operate.

Annoyances:

1. The front passenger door does not have a control for locking all doors. You have to use your key. There may be some safety reason for this but it's annoying.

2. The open-door light doesn't specify what door is open. This must have saved Mazda about $5.00 per vehicle. That was a very dumb decision. You have to walk around and look for the incompletely closed door.

3. The floor mats obscure the attachment points for new generation car seats that use the rear attachment.

4. Our (unwanted, but an unavoidable option for us) security system malfunctioned one day. The lights flashed and horn beeped unendingly. I pulled the horn fuse and a terrific dealership in Burlington Vermont somehow reset it. It's worked since. They don't know what happened.

5. The cargo net is an expensive extra. (Cheap!)

6. If you get the security package (hard to avoid) getting extra keys made costs a bundle and is quite annoying to do (need to bring in all keys).

7. The rear seat, which folds down nicely, is much flimsier than the Honda rear seat.

8. The front shades are wrapped in cheap vinyl. Tacky.

9. Front seats are bit longer than the Honda, a bit more comfortable for taller persons.

Overall, a decent van that's working for us. However the price is not much less than a Honda Odyssey, and the Odyssey is a much more finished vehicle. For most people this would be a second choice, for us the price made it a good value.
