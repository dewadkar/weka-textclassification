            Okay to some folks a 4 door is far from a dream car. But I have always taken pride in my weirdness. For as long as I can remember I have always wanted a brand new Honda Civic. I have had used Honda's, but I wanted one that no one had owned but me.

When we finally decided to get a new car, I of course wanted a Honda. My husband wanted a Toyota. So we test drove, we price checked, we safety checked, we talked to folks who had owned both. But I think what sealed the deal was when we talked to our mechanic, he simply reminded us how little maintenance we had to do on our 84 Honda (we changed the clutch for the first time at 160,000.) So we test drove again. This time the actual Honda we were looking at. A '99 Civic LX 4 door in a very nice silver with matching upholstery. I am happy to say we leased the car and including our 5-mile test drive the car had 6 miles on it when we drove it home.

What do I love about this car? It's simple really, it is reliable, it always starts without fail, even when the gauge reads empty, although I don't think they guarantee that. It looks nice; the silver stays clean a while and cleans up very nicely. It fits my shorter frame of 5' 1&quot; as well as my husbands almost 6 feet; the seat has knobs that turn to adjust pitch, elevation and location in relation to the steering wheel. It fits both my baby's infant seat and my child's booster seat safely. It has a valet key that only opens the doors and drives; it will not open the trunk. This allows me to use valet service with confidence while shopping. It has a 6 disc CD, an alarm (the kind that unlocks the doors) and a Lo-Jack.

What do I not like about this car? Occasionally the door's stick, actually I think it's the latches not catching and the handle therefore not working. Locking and unlocking usually corrects this. The black trim that adorns the edges of the doors comes unglued in hot weather. There is no adjustable lumbar support, just the standard support built into the seat. 

Who should buy this vehicle? Anyone who wants a quality, dependable car, Honda has always been known for its good looks and reliability. Anyone with kid's, the civic is just made for driving kids around, it is comfortable and gets excellent gas mileage, but isn't so large as to force you to have to drive the entire soccer team to the game. Anyone with babies, it is a very quiet car with a great sound system, letting you play your &quot;Baby Mozart&quot; CD's while baby snoozes undisturbed.

From the owner of both an '84 and a '99 Civic I can tell you, few cars can beat the quality of a Honda. Both of mine are still in perfect working order and require no more than the basic maintenance. These are excellent vehicles.
