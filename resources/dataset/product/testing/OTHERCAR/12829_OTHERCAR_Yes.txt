            What can you say about the RAV4 other than &#145spectacular.&#146  This car combines the benefits of larger SUV&#146s with the benefits of smaller passenger cars.  Great gas mileage, four-wheel drive, comfortable ride, space for passengers and/or cargo &#150 what else could you ask for?

When I started shopping for cars this spring, a RAV4 wasn&#146t even on my list of possibilities.  My only requirements were that the vehicle gets reasonable gas mileage and had either four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.  I had always owned Subarus and I was planning on purchasing a new Subaru because of my experience with them.  However, after seeing prices on those new Subarus, I decided to expand out my search.  I looked at both the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CRV.  I test drove several of them and my folks have a CRV that I had driven in the past quite frequently.

Styling wise, after looking at both the CRV and the RAV, the newly redesigned RAV definitely caught more of my attention.  The styling is sporty, outdoorsy (I&#146m not sure I could say rugged) and somewhat sophisticated at the same time.  The CRV on the other hand appears to be more focused on aerodynamics than real styling &#150 I think the Toyota team has definitely won in the regard.

As a tall guy (6ï¿½&#148), my first concern with a vehicle is legroom.  Most vehicles I have to have the seat all the way back and my legs are still crunched up against the wheel.  The first thing I noticed with the RAV is that when I sat down, I actually had to pull the seat forward in order for it to be comfortable.  This was the first car that I ever sat in where I didn&#146t have to put the seat all the way back in order to fit.

I test-drove both a standard and an automatic version of the RAV.  If you know how to drive a stick, the standard is 100 times better than the automatic.  The automatic while having enough power does not have the kick that the standard has and is not half as fun to drive as the stick model is.  In addition the manual transmission is one of the nicest transmissions I have ever used.  Shifting is smooth and clutch action is easy.

In the end, I purchased a new RAV4.  I did not get the L package on the RAV, but the standard options package.  The model has a standard transmission, and four-wheel drive.  The only extra I did get was runner bars along the sides so that people have something to step on when getting in and out of the vehicle.

Even the price of the RAV4 was great.  Comparable vehicles from Honda or an all-wheel drive vehicle from Subaru probably all run at least several thousand dollars higher than the Toyota and in the end I think you get a better deal for your money out of the Toyota.

I&#146ve now had the RAV for about 5 months and found that it is a blast to drive and has been one of the best cars that I have had.  My gas mileage runs anywhere between about 24 to 28 miles per gallon and I can go about 300 miles on a single tank of gas (on average).  I haven&#146t had all that much opportunity to try out the four-wheel drive in snow (since I got it in April), but I did a bit in New Hampshire.  The RAV handled very well (as long as you get used to having a higher center of gravity) in that little bit of snow.  I have done some off-roading with the RAV and found that it handles dirt, mud and rock fairly well and have been quite impressed every time I have taken it out.  As for a city vehicle, it is also great.  I commute into Boston every morning and it&#146s been a great commute car.

I&#146ve taken a few trips with the RAV to New York and to New Hampshire.  There&#146s plenty of cargo space.  The two backseats can fold down or pop right out to give you even more space.  As for passengers, you can fit 4 people comfortably and you can fit 5 people if you stuff three people in the backseat.  Even with a full load of cargo or passengers, the RAV continues to ride very well and continues to get good gas mileage.

I would whole-heartedly recommend the Toyota RAV4 to anyone who is considering a smaller SUV with the benefits of a big SUV and a passenger car.  In the RAV4 you get great styling, good gas mileage, four-wheel drive (if you want it) and plenty of space for passengers and/or cargo.  If you can forgo driving a monster down the road and want the functionality of an SUV, then I think you would best be suited with a RAV.

1/23/03 Update - Now that I have had the RAV for about 8 months or so, I still have not found anything to complain about.  Other than having my oil changed, nothing at all has gone wrong with the car.  Massachusetts also finally had a real winter and the RAV has been handling great in the snow, on the back roads on for highway driving.  Gas mileage is still between 24 to 28 and sometimes I have even managed to hit 30 with a lot of highway driving.  I can't rave enough about the RAV!
