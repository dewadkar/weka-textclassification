                    I found that the price was right for me to buy this car at the time. To this day I wish I had made another selection. I bought my Kia when it had only 6 miles on it. It was small but I thought the gas would be cheap and the car would last for at least 5 years. It didn't last a week. There were so many things wrong with this car I will try to remember them all. 

        The first thing that went wrong was it wasn't taking gas. I would go to the pump and spend I swear 15 mins filling it up. And it would say full, however I was left 2 times on the side of the road because it ran out of gas. I could not understand what was wrong the meter said it was half full, yet here I was on the side of the road with a dead NEW car. I took it in for work one week to the day I bought it, and told the men about the problem. They told me it was normal for a car to take that long to fill until they tried. There was a problem with the fuel tank. So they &quot;fixed&quot; it. 

        Two days later I opened my back right door and the seal around the door came off, that same day someone was getting out of that door and a plastic piece of the car by the floor came off. Three days after that one hour before I was going to drop it off at the shop, the tire cover in the trunk broke. At the shop the guys &quot;fixed&quot; the seal checked the fuel pump again and put the plastic thing back on. They also ordered a new tire cover. 

        Lets see my car is about two weeks old and has been to the shop twice. When I went to pick up my tire cover I asked the guys if they would fix the seal on the back left door this time and find a leak that I had on the front right side of the dash board. They kept my car 3 days fixing these problems. Then I had to return because both seals this time came off the windows and I was still having problems filling the car up. 


        It would now take me 20 mins. to fill My Kia up!!!! Then to top everything off i get a recall notice on my car something about the fuel pump. So I had to bring my car in the shop AGAIN to have it stay there 2 days so that this recall could be fixed. As soon as Saturn came out with their new LS I traded that NIGHTMARE of a car in. I lost out in the end with what I owed on the HUNK OF JUNK (at not even a year old it had lost $4000.00) Now I have a WONDERFUL car and will tell anyone who will listen DONT BUY A KIA!!!!! To top everything off it drove like a brick. It was not fun to drive at all.<br><br>
