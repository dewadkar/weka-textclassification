            When I started looking for a digital camera, I expected to pay upwards of $1000 for a real good camera. However, when I found the Kodak DC-240 my expectation of cost for product diminished. This camera wowed me with its ease of use, its portability, and above all its price. The price of this camera was right for me and it looked as though it could get the job done. However, I was amazed when I first used this camera. The pictures were incredibly clear. I expected them to look as though they were made on a computer, however, even when I printed them onto paper (glossy photo paper, of course) it looked like a real photo. I deeply love my digital camera and am very pleased with my purchase. I recommend this to anyone searching for a great digital camera at a good price.<br><br>
