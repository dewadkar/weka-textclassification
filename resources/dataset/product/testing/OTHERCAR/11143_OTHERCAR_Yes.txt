            QV 3500 is the direct successor of the camera QV 3000. If they put near, they will look as two brothers-twins. From apart only strict black color of body allows distinguishing QV 3500. When closer look it becomes clear, that outwardly camera has not undergone any modifications: it is the same body, same optics and, is probably, as would show it opening, same matrix. However, I did not open camera and believe to the manufacturer. 

Thus, it is the camera in body 3000 with optics from Canon and matrix ICX252 from Sony. In appearance there are two small modifications: the window of infrared port has disappeared and instead of a decorative ring around objective a ring with a thread for optical tools at last has appeared. However, thread is rather exotic, somewhere something about 48 mm. So, with appearance like have understood. 

Now we pass to an internal essence and character of the camera. And characters at cameras polar. The familiarity with the camera QV 3000 will not help you in dialogue with 3500, as systems of the menu at them is different: at QV 3500 it something similar QV 2800.

QV 3500 has become less hidden. All undocumentary features intrinsic QV 3000, now become documentary and at once are accessible when reading the description of the camera. So, now you quite legally can select between recording files in format JPEG and TIFF. And the file format TIFF now quite standard and easily is understood by any program, including such as Photoshop. It is good or poorly, to decide to you, as now one frame in format TIFF-RGB takes 9 Mb against 6 at QV 3000 in TIFF-YC and, accordingly, is transferred through USB in the computer through 50 s with difference from 27 s at QV 3000. 

With the camera the remote control is delivered, same, as at QV 2800. The modifications have touched also software of remote control. Now when you use program DiCa Soft you can make shooting, recording each shoot at once after shooting in the computer for any focal length. 

Unfortunately, the unification with QV 2800 has both positive and negative sides. The switching between setting of an exposition, priority of the diaphragm is valid, perhaps, more convenient, than at QV 3000. And here the sequence of switching of modes of a focussing, on my sight, is a step back. 

As well as in the camera QV2800, in the menu there is a lot of specialized tunings permitting, not reflecting, to do almost all kinds of shooting. The menu of viewing too has undergone some modifications, and they, in main, pleasant. So, you can look an information about parameters, with which the frame was shooting and even to see a histogram of brightness of points in a frame. It is interesting, that if in the camera to insert a map of memory shot on the camera QV 3000, you will see a histogram and for frames shooting by QV 3000.

Quality of shots is enough good and have not revealed cardinal differences between cameras, therefore everything, that concerns to shots made QV 3000, can be referred and to QV 3500.

On my sight, for purchase of the camera QV 3500 speak two facts. First is a possibility of remote control and shooting of frames with any focal length, with transfer of frames in the computer at once after shooting. The second argument for this camera is the possibility of using of a firm transitional ring for optical tools. In remaining, 3000 and 3500 are completely equivalent. Those who already have QV 3000 can not hurry it to change.
