            After owning many used cars (European, Japanese and US, alphabetically from Alfa-Romeo to Volvo) over 20+ years, I decided to get my first new car. Having owned three Mazdas previously, and seeing the Protege recommended highly in &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine, I took a look at the Protege, and to make a long story short, I bought the Protege a year ago and have no regrets!

(My previous car was a Mazda MX3 sport coupe--I'd still be driving that, except that it was wrecked in an accident. But I digress...)

In a new small car, I was looking for one feature: A center-rear shoulder belt. At the time, the small cars I was aware of with this feature were the Protege and the Chevy Prizm/Toyota Corolla twins. (At least as of a year ago, the Saturns lacked this feature. The current VW Jetta has this feature, I've learned.) Overall, I found the Protege jazzier and a little more fun to drive than the Prizm/Corolla twins, plus I'd liked my previous Mazdas.

So that my wife can drive it easily, I chose a Protege with the automatic transmission. For this size of car and engine (1.6 liter; an optional 1.8 liter is available for more $$$), the automatic transmission does well in most any driving conditions.

However, it's only adequate for driving in the mountains, which I do a few times a year. Overall, I think the manual transmission and/or the bigger engine would be a better choice for people who need to drive on steep grades regularly.

As for reliability, the Protege runs perfectly. At 13K+ miles, so far all I've done is routine maintenance. If I needed to buy a new car today, I'd probably buy another Protege. It's very comfortable, quiet for a small car, and has great ergonomics too.

The only odd thing I've noticed about the Protege is that when I roll down the driver's window (I have electric windows), I can feel the inside of the driver's door bow outwards very slightly against my arm--it's a forgivable quirk, but feels slightly odd. Many people would probably never notice this--just something I've never noticed on any other car. I'd also like the Protege to have headlights that are on all the time, like GM cars. It's no big deal to turn on the headlights, but having the headlights on all the time automatically is a good safety feature--makes your car more noticeable to other drivers.

(By the way, recently I drove a rental Ford Focus and liked that almost as much as the Protege, as far as driving and interior. But the Focus is too new to know what to expect in the way of reliability. Eventually, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; will have reliability data on the Focus--by the April, 2001 auto issue at the latest, I assume. And as a used or ex-rental car, and because there are so many Ford dealers, you might be able to get a great deal on a Focus. One quirk about the Focus: I left my rental Focus parked in a snowstorm, and the headlight lenses accumulated snow, which I had to brush off before I could drive. The lenses are so close to flat--almost as flat as the hood--that snow piles up on the lenses while the Focus is parked, and doesn't blow off, at least at low speeds. Another car quirk I'd never seen before.)

In conclusion, the Ford Focus might be worth a look too, assuming the Focus' reliability turns out to be decent, but consumers probably can't go wrong with the Protege (or with the Prizm/Corolla either). Overall, I prefer the Protege.<br><br>
