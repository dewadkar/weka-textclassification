            My husband and I were already discussing the purchase of a new car this year, but the buy was sped up when our Jeep Cherokee met a tree head on this February.  We decided on a Honda CR-V after hearing nothing but raves from friends and family who own them, and we are confident we made the right decision.  As we are weird people and name our cars (the Cherokee was known as "the honeytruck"--don't ask, I don't have the space), we immediately named our 2001 CR-V EX "the Smurfmobile" due to its bright blue color (a rare breed among CR-Vs, we're told, and yes, I chose the color!) and general cuteness.

The CR-V is in the same size class as the Toyota RAV4 or the Chevy Tracker, but unlike either of those provides a great deal of standard features that are usually options--CD player, cruise control, alloy wheels, etc.  The 4-cylinder engine may not win Daytona, but it zips pretty nicely on a commute.  Visibility is great!  The interior is well laid out, and unlike many SUVs it isn't a pain in the butt to fold the seats down to get more stuff in--in fact, each back seat can be folded down individually, which is great for carrying oddly shaped stuff.  My only complaint is with the air conditioning/heating system--the knob may say OFF, but I can always feel a warm or cool breeze in the car depending which way the temperature knob is turned, but this is a minor complaint.  The gas mileage is decent as well--we've been averaging 22, and got 30 on a interstate trip.  If you like the looks of an SUV but don't want to be putting your salary in the gas tank and don't need cargo space the size of Guatemala, you will not go wrong with the CR-V.

By the way, if you're ever driving in the Richmond, VA area and see a bright blue CR-V with a stuffed Smurf sitting on the dashboard, you have just seen the Smurfmobile!
