            My 2000 Olds Silhouette is 4 weeks old. I love it.
Excellent ride, combined with luxury features, not found on all the other makes, equals a superb van.

As for looks, let me tell you something, it's a handsome vehicle.
Compared to the Dodge product it looks masculine and strong.
Compared to the Ford, it gives the impression of strength.
Compared to anything else, it JUST PLAIN outshines!

Time for some realism.

As much as this van THRILLS, it has a couple of drawbacks:

Interior noise:... Rattles and clunks.
Mine has been back to the shop and the guess is, a unaligned hatch which is causing the clunking (problem corrected.... still no change).
As for the rattles, I have been told it's the seats.  NO solution!!

... Power, or should I say lack of.
Going uphill, noticeable loss of power, to the point where you have to give some extra juice. 

Enough complaining. 
 
Overall, very satisfied.  As for the above problems, the noises can be fixed, or just learn to live with them.
I doubt the power issue can be resolved.

Overall...... I am giving this van 5 Stars.
The pros out-weigh the cons in a HUGE way.

My request to all the readers........ please post your Epinions regarding my issues. Let's see if you've had similar complaints.
I am most interested in what you did to resolve the problems.
Any other issues that I have not experienced?

Thanks and regards to all!

Secret Agent.
