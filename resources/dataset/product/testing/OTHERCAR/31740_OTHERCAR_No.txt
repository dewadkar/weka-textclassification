            While many reviews here discuss the newer cars, this review is about the older versions of this car.

My main experience with these cars is my friends Intrepid, which we use to get to and from school. (carpoolers get very good spots) At first it seemed like an ok car, and the styling was typical of 90s Dodges, with flashy lines and a sharp design that makes it seem less like the family car it is supposed to be. This car typically gets fairly light duty, with maybe a few miles around town each day. After awhile this car started getting some very strange shakes when it was not up to speed, eventually becoming bad enough that it had to be sent to the dealership's shop to alieviate this problem. What they said was just a &quot;tune-up&quot; ended up taking 4-5 days, which put both of us at an inconvienience.

As of now, it seems to be working fine, but my friend says this has happened before. This and other things end up making the car seem poorly built.

Its a great looking car, but if reliability is high on your list, I would suggest considering other cars.<br><br>
