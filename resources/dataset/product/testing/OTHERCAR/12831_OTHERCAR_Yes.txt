Toyota  RAV4, 2002

For the 2002 RAV4, Toyota�s designers and engineers went back to the drawing board and came out with a re-designed and re-engineered product to offer consumers.

The model I drove was equipped with the package B option and this added to the base vehicle air conditioning, ABS brakes, power windows, power mirrors, keyless entry and cruise control.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The new 2002 RAV4 is longer, higher and wider than its predecessor this does give the driver and passengers more room is. I remember driving a 2000 model and did feel quite coupe in so this improvement was needed.

Another excellent change is with the new all-aluminum,     4-cylinder engine that adds 21 horsepower more than the 2001 RAV4 had.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

Immediately after opening the driver side door, I did noticed the added space compared to the 2000 model.

The dealership had a 2000 RAV4 on their used car lot. I drove by before the test-drive and opened the door and yes quite a big difference in space, not only for the front seat and rear seat occupants but also for the cargo volume available.

In the 2002 model, sitting behind the steering wheel you will have an excellent front and rear view, I was a little displeased with the small size side view mirrors, so if you
intend to pull any trailer what so ever you will need to add larger after market mirrors.

From the driver�s seat you have an excellent view of all gauges and all control buttons can also easily be seen and reached.

The sound coming from the audio system was not the best but still very acceptable.

The base model comes equipped with power door locks, tilt steering, AM/FM radio, CD player, rear window defrost and luggage rack. Other options are available but you have to get them as a package.

The exterior:

I did like how they re-engineered  the RAV4 for 2001, I am not so keen about the new design styling. There is nothing wrong with it is just a matter of personal taste.

The cargo volume is at 23.9 cubic feet and the standard towing capacity is at 1500 pounds.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The RAV4 I test drove had under the hood:

Engine: A 2-liters, 4-cylinders motor that will develop 148 horsepower at 6,000 RPM.
Transmission: A 5-speed manual transmission.
Brakes: Front disc and rear drums with ABS.
Tires: 215/70R16
Safety: Driver and passenger front airbags.
        Child safety locks.
        Keyless remote entry.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The 2001 RAV4 is a fun SUV to drive. Aside from the manual transmission, which can be annoying when driving around town it handles rally, well both on city streets and on the highway.

I am not to happy with the package options set-up that Toyota has, you always end up with something you do not want and the option you really want is part of another package.
