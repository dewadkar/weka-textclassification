            We have had our Outback since Dec., 1999. In general, it's a little gem with some small impurities. We like its generally good fuel economy. We get about 27 mpg in mixed city driving in the summer. This drops to 24 mpg in the winter. The car feels quite secure in winter driving. The seat heaters add a nice bit of warmth on a frigid morning. The space of a conventional station wagon is important to us and this car delivers just what we need.  We can haul large, awkward items such as a rototiller or a lawn mower with ease. Its size fits in nicely between a minivan and a conventional sedan. The Outback is quiet on long trips and provides us with a nice environment for listening to books on tape. 

The front seats are our real sore spot with this otherwise excellent car. We replaced the padding with softer foam because the original was far too hard for our taste. After an hour or so of driving, we were both in great pain from the seats in spite of having a power adjustment for the driver. There is inadequate travel on the front passenger seat for long legged people. There is only one intermittent wiper speed, which means the driver still has to do an occasional manual swipe to clear the windshield.

Dealer prices for parts are quite high for the do-it-yourselfer. Spark plug changes are a major hassle even though there are only four of them.
