            I just did trade off my 1997 Malibu, and did so with some reservations. I traded it on a pickup truck, which I need now, or I never would have parted with it. I bought the Malibu new in 1997, only put 13000 miles on it in two years, and really thought I would drive it for the rest of my life. I'm sure somebody will enjoy it for another 10 years or more.

I bought it quite simply because it was the classiest looking car I could afford! It looked just like the Buicks, and not just a little like the Catera. And I got a good deal on it. 

The only maintenance I ever had to do on it was to keep the oil changed. The car had one repair - the headlights were somehow not seated properly when I got it, and moisture collected behind the lenses. The dealer put in whole new headlight assemblies at no charge, and I never had any more trouble with it.

I am a short person, and usually have trouble seeing out of mid-size or full-sized cars. And this one was no exception. I had to sit on a cushion to drive, and still couldn't see the front fenders. I like to be able to see the fenders to help me judge distances.

The car did have one really great accommodation for us short folks: The seatbelt was adjustable at the door post, so the shoulder strap wouldn't dig into my neck. I've never had a vehicle before or since, that had that feature.

It didn't get great mpg, though I never actually checked it, but I didn't buy it for economy. I bought it for reliability and good looks, and got both.<br><br>
