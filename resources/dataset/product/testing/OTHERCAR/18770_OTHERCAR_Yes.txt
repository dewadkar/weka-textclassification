            This is my second half to my Kia experience. I figured if I added this to the other one, it would end up being way too long. I suggest to read the first part before reading this one to get a sense of what's going on....

As I stated in the last opinion, the 1997 Kia Sephia that my fiance and I owned really hadn't given us any trouble..(I bet you guys can see where this is going!) In all honesty, the problems we had were fairly minor, but if we had kept the car, I think it would have gotten worse. A few months ago (around 55,000 miles) we had to replace the back half of the exhaust pipe. It started with a small hole that eventually got bigger and made us sound like a motorcycle coming down the road. :) We went to the dealer who informed us that a new pipe would cost over 200 dollars. Hello?! Luckily my fiance has a friend in a repair shop and he was able to give us a pipe and labor for 50 dollars. We weren't happy about the hassle, but you can't beat that price. 

Then at about 56,000 miles the check engine light came on. We had a different friend who is a mechanic look at it and he didn't see anything wrong with it. He didn't charge us anything for that. (Thankfully!!) At about 58,000 miles the car started to shake on the highway. we thought maybe it needed a tire rotation or balance and alignment. We had the tires and all that checked, and they were fine. The shaking got worse and also was noticeable idling. It was like being in one of those massage chairs. 

We decided that it was time for our dear Kia to go. We didn't want to start dumping money into a car that we still owed 9,000 dollars on. Many a dealer didn't even want to look at it, and the most we were offered was about 2,700 dollars. Since I just bought a 2000 Dodge Neon a few weeks ago (I'll write soon about that!), we decided to try that dealership. The GODS must have been smiling on us that day, because they gave us an awesome deal. We ended up with only about 600 dollars carry over. So now my fiance also has a 2000 Dodge Neon. We match. We are so cool. (Bleh!)

My overall point of view is the Kia lasted us three years with minimal problems. It would have been nice if it lasted longer than that, but what are you gonna do? I'm able to say this fairly nicely because we were able to get out of our hole. If we didn't, then I'm sure this opinion would have had a much different tone.  I don't know if the newer ones were more solidly built or not, but I sure hope so. I would still recommend this car if you can pay it off in three years, maximum. <br><br>
