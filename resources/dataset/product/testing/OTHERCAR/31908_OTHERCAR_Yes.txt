            We recently purchased a 2001 Subaru Forester S model.  We love it!  We traded in a 1994 Nissan Pathfinder 4X4.  We had excellent service from the Pathfinder but I did not like the gas mileage it got (17 tops on the road)or the power when traveling in the mountains (especially pulling our tent trailer).  I did a lot of research including reading the 2000 Consumer Report Auto issue before I decided on the Forester.

I found, for the price, the Forester is an excellent value compared to other SUVs.  The S model comes with just about everything you would expect in a good SUV.  It actually has several more items we like than the Pathfinder did.  I bought the 5 speed for economy and power.  I am pleased to report it was the right choice.  We have a vacation house in the San Bernardino mountains which requires climbing a 14 to 16% grade on the way up (to 6700 ft elevation)  I had the Forester fully loaded with 3 adults (none of us small)the dog AND the cat (in his carrier) plus ice chest and overnight bags.  The Forester climbed up the hill without much effort.  We have filled up the tank 4 or 5 times now.  It got 27.5 mpg on a day trip and 25 mpg on the other fill-ups.  I live in the desert so we are running the air conditioning (very effective system)most of the time.  The all wheel drive works extremely well in sand.

We have found the Forester to be adequately roomy and comfortable on an all day trip.  The 6 disc in dash CD player is standard, electronic thermometer standard, cruise, pwr windows, 16 inch wheels, ABS, 4 wheel disc brakes are just some of the features.  I managed about $1500 below MSRP by negotiating through the internet on the 2001 model.  The 2000 models offer less equipment for the same MSRP - get the 2001.  For $21,500 I believe we got a good one! 

September 2000 update:  Our car is just turning over 6000 miles and I thought an quick update is in order.  I just read the new Consumers Report write-up on the Forester and find it all to be accurate and true.  We continue to drive our car up and down some pretty steep grades to our mountain cabin (2nd home).  We've encountered some pretty heavy rain in it and found the All Wheel Drive traction to be excellent.  I still continue to find functional little features which make the car even more fun to own.  I've talked to other owners with automatics and they wish they had bought the 5 speed for more power. 

November 2000 update:  Snow has arrived in the San Bernardino mountains and I've driven the Forester up the 14 - 16% grades in the snow and ice.  The AWD worked flawlessly.  I passed a number of cars and trucks who had to stop and &quot;chain up.&quot;  The Forester requires no stopping to lock hubs, no backing up to release hubs (as I had to do with my Pathfinder). It was actually fun to drive in the winter conditions.  I did have to watch my speed, though.  The AWD works so well that it would be easy to exceed safe speeds for the conditions. <br><br>
