            Prelude
----------------------------------------------------------
The wife and I were searching for a reliable near-luxury auto to replace ou venerable Grand Am.  After much research, we looked at all of the biggies: Accord, Camry, 3-Series, etc.  After out alternator failed (followed by the computer itself), we decided to bite the bullet.

As we were looking at the Honda dealership, our alternator decided to call it quits.  Since the Pontiac/Cadillac dealer was nearby, we decided to swing it in for service. An eager salesman told me that the service department was closed (5PM on a Saturday, no biggie), but since I was trading, maybe I should look around.  We rode around to every lot they had, seeing nothing but the usual Cavaliers, Grand Ams, and GM/Chevy trucks they usually trade for.  As I knew they were a Caddy dealer, I asked about the Catera, since they were in our long list of possibilities.  Well, well, well... they had just traded for a "creampuff," a '98 one-owner with 24,000 miles.  We looked at it and asked if we could take it home, since it was better than a taxi (being as my mount was in service!).  We were informed that it was due for new tires and that they would need to replace them before we could take the car for a spin (it hadn't even been inspected by the dealer yet).  After waiting 2 days, and having them loan us a '99 Grand Prix GTP, we finally got to drive the Catera home for a trial.


The Car Itself
-----------------------------------------------------------
'98 Cadillac Catera w/o the Sport Option 
Gold with tan leather
All options except trunk-mounted CD changer

Engine
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Opel V6 that powers the Catera is adequate, but I stress that word severely.  It will get you up to speed, but passing power and merging prowess are limited. The reason??? Horsepower/weight ratio.  The car is simply too heavy to be pushed easily by the V6.  As a result, it has little to no midrange punch.  As a Sunday cruiser, however, it will do fine.  The car also ran a little hot for my taste.  It hovered around the boiling point, never crossing into dangerous territory but coming too close for my comfort.

Interior
-----------------------------------------------------------
The leather itself is nice, but isn't up to BMW's standards quite yet.  I also felt very cramped after awhile, with little or no legroom to stretch a bit.  Headroom was OK with the moonroof, but I still had to tilt my head a little to keep the top of my hair from brushing the roof (I am 6'4", and this is a common occurrence).  Ergonomics are fine, but the steering-wheel controls are a little tough and the turn-signal lever is a little bulky.  A/C controls take some getting used to, but are pretty intuitive.
Rear seat comfort is merely OK, for the unlucky person behind me is stuck in Crampsville.  There are nice little vents for the backseat passengers located in the center console.
Visibility is fine, with one large blindspot behind the B-pillar.  

Ride
-----------------------------------------------------------
Billed as the "Caddy that Zigs," the Catera has a stiff, sporty ride that tries to mimic the 3-Series and C-Class.  Unfortunately, it cannot be called comfortable.  Although some media have said it is more supple than the 3-Series, I have to disagree.  Handling is fine, with a touch of understeer.  I had no problem with that.

ALL OF THIS WOULD SEEM POSITIVE, BUT...

Reasons for not buying the Catera
------------------------------------------------------------
The car is simply a Lemon no matter how you look at it.  Consumer Reports grenades it, as well as Consumer Guide and Epinions.  Since I had no experience with the Catera before I looked at it, I am so glad I didn't trust my gut instinct to go with Cadillac.

After running a Carfax check (highly recommended), I found that the car itself had been in the shop a total of 11 times in 2 1/2 years. 6 visits were due to recalls, the other to "non-routine service."  Sad...  

I called the previous owners, who echoed my findings. The car had 3 sets of tires in 3 years, due to the infamous alignment problems I have read about on other Epinions, and the serpentine belt had to be replaced at 13,500 miles. The older couple who had it before told me to run away as far as I could. They were emphatic about it, too... guess I could take a hint.


Overall
------------------------------------------------------------
I hate it that this car wouldn't work for us, since you would think that Cadillac would equal quality.  I really wanted to like the car, and it was disconcerting that reality dictated this for us.

So, what did we end up with??? The '99 GTP we drove home with in the first place!!!  Yep, there is a review for it as well.
