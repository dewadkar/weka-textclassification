            My husband and I bought this car in the summer of 1998.   We brought it in several times for problems with the brakes in just the first couple of months.  The rotors were replaced 3 times.  In the winter, the car wouldn't start.  We had to have the car towed 4 times last winter alone.  One of the last times we had to get the car towed, it was a very cold morning, and I was trying to get to work.  We called the Kia road side assistance, and they assured us that the car would get towed to the dealer and repaired.  When I came home from work that night, my car was still in my driveway.  The road side assistant persons had jumped my car and left it running in my driveway for a total of 9 hours.  It had used up a half a tank of gas.  We called the next day to complain about this and spoke to who I thought was a manager, hoping to get paid back for the gas.  We have yet to hear anything from them.  (Not even an apology).  That's just the beginning of our problems.  The trunk leaked water in when it rained.  The seals on the door were replaced numerous times.  One of the reasons they said the car would not start was something to do with the fly wheel.  But instead of fixing the fly wheel they charged the battery and jump started the car. Overall, I think that if you are looking for something reliable to have year round, this would probably not be the car of your choice.<br><br>
