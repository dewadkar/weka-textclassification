            I began looking for a lightweight camera that I could use on a vacation that had a good automatic mode for producing idiot-proof pictures.  My criteria were:

- sensible, intuitive user interface
- good performance, resolution, specifications
- solid construction, convenient size, handy to bring anywhere
- good value in the $400 - $600 price range w/ 2+ megapixel resolution
- ability to manually override the standard exposure settings as I got more familiar w/ the camera
- ability to capture images quickly and in rapid succession

After looking at some digital camera models at a local store, I realized that some had absolutely TERRIBLE controls, poor menu systems, and were completely non-intuitive in how they provided options to the user.

The Coolpix 800 was instantly usable, and when I activated the menu system, I instantly could navigate using the up/down controls with my right thumb and make a selection by depressing the shutter button with my index finger. The windowing system was legible on either the display or on a TV if connected.

Results: The images I've captured have been superb, and the 1200x1600 resolution does allow me to print relatively large size images with good results. The VGA mode allows me to capture quite a number of additional pictures if I'm intending to publish on-line or use only on computer.

Accessories:  I picked up a 32M CF card for add'l storage which gave me plenty of space for a full day's worth of Fine resolution shots, and also picked up a NiMH recharger and hi-capacity spare batteries which could last a couple of full days, with conservative but not restrictive use of the rear display. 

Software: I use both the Mac and a Win98 machine, I transfer images to computer by inserting the CF card into a PC-card slot via an adapter, and the transfers are near-instant. I tried the serial connection, which works fine as a last resort.  Viewing images works fine with the Nikon browser on the Mac, but am trying out various photo-printing services now to see which works best (Ofoto.com, PhotoAccess.com, and Shutterfly.com), each of which have photo-manipulation software.  I also use PhotoDeluxe on the Mac to print on an Epson Stylus Color, which produces good quality prints on photo-quality paper.

Summary: Great device. The $75 rebate and no sales tax gave me a great price for the functionality of this unit.  I'm having fun with it, am learning more, and continue to be impressed by the added features and functionality of the camera.
