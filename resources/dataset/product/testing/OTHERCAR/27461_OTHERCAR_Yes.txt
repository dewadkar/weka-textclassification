            I have owned a 1995 Dodge Neon for four and a half years and been extremely pleased with the vehicle.  Since I travel alot for business and to visit family, my main concern when buying a car was to get one that was reliable and economical at the gas pump.  I got both when I bought the Neon.  My Dodge is a Neon Sport which as I understand it is not much different than a regular Neon, just a little longer with a couple of added features (a better stereo being one of them).  The Neon has never broken down on me and it now has over 86,000 miles on it.  I take average preventive maintenance of it, but nothing special besides regular oil changes, an occasional tune-up, and having the tires rotated.  One problem that I have had with the car which turned out to be more of a nuisance was the &quot;check engine&quot; light kept coming on.  I had to take it to the dealership three separate times before they finally figured out that it was just an electrical short that was causing the light to keep coming on.  But that has honestly been the most serious problem I have had with the Neon in over four years.  The vehicle has more power than most people think and handles quite well in poor weather conditions.  I would recommend the Dodge Neon to anyone  looking for an economical car that also looks and handles pretty well on the road.<br><br>
