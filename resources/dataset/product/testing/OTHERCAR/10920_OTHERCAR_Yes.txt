            I had the opportunity to drive one of these beautiful cars a few weeks ago. I did mostly highway driving and a little bit of backroad driving(which was much more fun and what this car was intended to do)

The way the car is put together is amazing for this day and age.
In this age of car companies just looking at the bottom line, 
it is refreshing to see a company who still values engineering
as priority numero uno. 

The 323Ci that I drove was silver, and looked
incredible sleek and sexy. This is due to the fact 
that it happens to share exactly ZERO body panels with 
the sedan (323i). The 323 (2.3 litre) engine is great
for most folks, especially if you normally drive the car alone
with no load. The 328 (2.8) does not add that much more power for the 
money, making the 323 a better value.

The engine is not over-muted as are some modern day cars, 
you can still hear the germanic sounds oozing out, which
is a good thing for some people but not preferable for others.
Another subtle feature which just goes to show the 
degree of thought put into this car is the way the windows
crack an inch when you open the door. This coupe is so airtight
that I am sure you would have trouble closing the doors without
this feature.

The precision and feel of the brakes and steering is the standard
against which all other cars should be judged. Both these features
are BMW's forte, and inspire confidence when you encounter a
road that can challenge this car.

This car will win many accolades, but this is hardly a surprise
since it has won so many awards for many, many years. 
Good luck finding one to drive.
