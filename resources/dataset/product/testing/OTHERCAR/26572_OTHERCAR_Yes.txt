            This was my first car purchase and I researched it thoroughly.  I admit that I was going to buy a domestic car but when I went to purchase it the promised interest rate was 6% higher so I walked off.  I paid more money for the Nissan and have NEVER regretted it!  I LOVE this car!  I have just started having more major things needing to be repaired (struts) but it still runs as well as it did the first day I drove it off the lot despite all the mileage I have put on it.  

The main thing I was looking for in a car was safety features.  This car has steel rods in the back seats and the engine drops down in an accident so as not to crush your legs.  At the time, air bags were new and this car has a driver air bag.

I was also VERY interested in mileage.  At the time of purchase, the car was supposed to get 40 on the highway and I would get 41-43.  I still get close to 40 even after seven years!

My needs have changed over the years and the car still meets them.  I have found that a lot of cars don't have compatible seatbelts for car seats.  I am able to use the seats next to the door for the forward facing car seat. The seatbelts lock when pulled all the way out, which a lot of cars don't. It is also very easy to tether car seats in the back seat.  I LOVE the child safety door locks also.

I admit there are a few things that I don't like about the car.  I don't like riding in the back seat since the seatbelts next to the door don't fit correctly (cut too deeply into my neck).  I don't like the fact that the back seats don't fold down to create a larger trunk (the steel rods prevent this but the safety issue was and still is more important than the trunk space). 

The only problem that I have had since day one is putting the car in reverse.  I have a manual transmission and it usually takes me more than one try to put the stick into reverse.

I think this is a great car for people with no kids or a for a small family.  It has a lot of zip and runs well.  Nissan has built a great car that keeps going, and going, and going....

My husband tells me that in about two more years we are going to need a new car.  HIS car will die before mine since I really think mine will live forever--the car is as tight as it was the first day, well almost.  I am told that I will get the new car.  I can't imagine NOT driving my Nissan. I LOVE it!  Personally, I think my husband wants my car!<br><br>
