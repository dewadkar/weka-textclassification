               I am the owner of a new 2002 Honda Civic EX. The EX seemed to be the best choice when reviewing all of the models available (EX, DX, etc.) It has the CD player, automatic moon roof and some other extras that make this car feel like a million dollars. (Well, not literally, but at least like 25 grand.)
   My main concerns when looking at new cars were gas mileage, eco-friendliness and safety. My gas mileage has averaged 34 miles to the gallon. When I was doing research on hybrid vehicles I came across the Civic as well. It is not as green as the hybrids, but Greenercars.com listed it as the second choice after the Honda Insight. Hybrids were slightly out of price range at the time of purchase. The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety listed the Civic as one of the Best Rating cars in collision tests. All of my criterian met in one car? I thought it would be impossible! 
   I am happy to report my odometer reads 6812 and not a single creak, clank, bang or pop. Not that I would expect any, but so far so good!
   I am not so happy to report that the carpet on the floor beneath the driver and passenger seats looks as if it is more than 6 months new. I do have floor mats down, but around the edges it is wearing. I would recomend maybe using a Scotch Guard protectant spray in addition to fairly large floor mats.
