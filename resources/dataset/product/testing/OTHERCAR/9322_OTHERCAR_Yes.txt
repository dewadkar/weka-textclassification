            The Toyota Supra proves to be one of the best twinturbos on the market producing 320 horsepower and 315 lbs of torque. The turbo model of the supra comes in a six-speed manual and four-speed automatic. Although, surprisingly the automatic is faster than the manual in the stock models because of the great design of the manual transmission.

The supra is especially for those who are enthused about having a fast good looking car at an affordable price. When the supra becomes modified it proves to be one of the fastest twinturbos on the market. The car is also great for racing because it can stop on a dime and corners very well. The supra comes very close to one of my favorite twinturbo's the Nissan 300zx. Although I love the 300z because of its looks I would rather buy a supra than a 300z because it makes up in speed what it lacks in looks. The supra is in fact well designed but does not compare to the 300 in looks. The turbo model of the supra comes with 17&quot; rims, which is nice because after market rims are not needed in this case.

I would not recommend a supra for those buying a car to get around or show off. Although the supra does fairly well in car shows I would only recommend the supra for true car enthusiasts. The supra requires a lot of work and maintenance because of being a twinturbo. If you are a person who does not have time to work on the car yourself you should not buy a supra. Getting a supra worked on by a mechanic may become costly and put a hole in your wallet.<br><br>
