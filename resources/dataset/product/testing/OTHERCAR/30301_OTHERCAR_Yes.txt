            I have driven my avalanche for about 12,000 miles and I am very happy with it.  I use it as a car most of the time, but it comes in handy on those trips to Home Depot and to haul around DJ equipment.  Power is great.  Gas Mileage is a pretty steady 15 on the fast highway situation between california and las vegas.
On Star bailed me out when I lost the keys as they say they can.
Car is very quiet and a pleasure to drive.  Very nimble.
Has a few electrical glitches which cause the alarm to go off unpredictably (twice), and the radio to lock (also twice), and the lumbar support to return to fully pumped out when the key is turned off (about half the time). Probably electrical noise that has to be filtered out somehow.
Reaction of friends is usually "what the h*** is THAT?", but when they ride in it they all want one.
