            Warning! The 2000 Northstar Engine has &quot;Product Problems&quot; 

We purchased a 2000 Deville DHS only to have it back for service six times. Turns out that Cadillac has redesigned the Northstar for 2000 to be more fuel efficient but there's just not enough fuel getting to the engine. Other engines could be quickly repaired by adjusting the fuel to air mixture but being computer/software controlled the dealers are unable to correct the defect. Most significant problem is that it shakes at idle &amp; feels like its running out of gas. The hotter the engine gets the worse the symptoms of the defect and the symptoms are magnified in gear with your foot on the brake. At a stop light or stop sign for example. After aggressive discussions with Cadillac we are told they know of the problem but still do not have a fix. All 2000 Northstars suffer from the same defect both the Seville &amp; Deville. Cadillac tells us they are working on a fix but over time the problem is only suspected to get worse as carbon builds up more fuel is soaked up and even less will be combusted

We are in negotiations with Cadillac &amp; expect to return the car due to the severity of the problem &amp; the non disclosure of the known defect by Cadillac at the time of purchase. More &amp; more people are returning to the Dealerships to seek some type of satisfaction or for refunds due to the un-repairable defect.<br><br>
