            I had the opportunity to run the new Corniche model some 170 miles on freeway and cross country to deliver it to its new owner. While no longer a Rolls-Royce/Bentley dealer, I was at one time and so have a more than normal familiarity with the various models including most of the pre-WWII cars. The Bentley Azure is the other convertible in this range, and I found the RR to be substantially more comfortable. The seating is less 'Continental', more comfortable. I had the feeling the windscreen provided a fuller view of the road. There was excellent head room for a tall person. The ride was excellent, and, compared to the Bentley suspension, less harsh, yet there was little lean in curves. The Rolls-Royce V8 engine with 'light turbo' boost is more than adequate to make this a fun car to drive; it has plenty of get up and go. The design of the fully retracting top is characteristic of the Bentley Azure; it operates smoothly and requires no assistance. There was no noticeable wind noise, particularly when compared with the earlier Corniche design, which was discontinued after 1995. Fit and finish are what one might expect from Rolls-Royce. The car includes modern electronics to control braking and ride control in addition to engine management. I'm not sure any car is worth over $350,000, but if you cherish a Corniche, that's the price you pay. <br><br>
