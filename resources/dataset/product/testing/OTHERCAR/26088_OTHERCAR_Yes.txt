Third Protege owned.  Previous models 1992 and 1995 (both DX).  Last car had 100k plus miles and was still going strong.  After physically searching and driving lots of other brands, I came to the conclusion that the protege is, by far, the best money spent.  I mean that it is a functional vehicle.  It looks small, yet seat four adults very comfortable.  It has a quiet ride and the position of the driver's seat makes me feel like I am very much in control of the road.  I don't know about you all, but sticker means a lot to me, and for $16K I was able to get everything I wanted in a car (including leather seats).  I was very much surprised.  I have put about 12K miles on my new one and other than fuel and oil I have not spent a dime (I will be honest...I have spent a lot of money also on wax.  I like to see my car shine on the road.)  I have never being happier with a car.  I like to pinch my pennies and I think that I did pretty well on this purchase, I highly recommend it.<br><br>
