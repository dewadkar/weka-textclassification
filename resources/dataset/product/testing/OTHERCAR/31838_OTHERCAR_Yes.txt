            I have owned Hondas since 1985.  My college-age son is still driving my 1990 Civic with 250,000 miles and the only major repair was replacing the clutch last year.  

My 2000 Civic 4-door EX does not disappoint.  It's got plenty of power for the highway and the gas mileage continues to run in the mid 30's (a big help with the rising gas prices).

If I had to complain, I would say that it seems this model is a little smaller on the passenger side than previous years.  A couple of friends who are rather on the heavy side have difficulty riding with me.

As with most standard sound systems, it's not that great.  I purchased a refurbished JVC receiver/CD changer combo and that does the trick.

The Civic is easy to drive and maneuver.  It's the most reliable car I know.  This model year seems to have better handling on wet surfaces--not so much being thrown around by water laying in the road.

All in all, the Civic continues to be my car of choice.  For a single mom on a limited budget you can't beat it.  I need to know I can rely on my transportation to get me to work EVERY day, and the Civic does just that--in style!
