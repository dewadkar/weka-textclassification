            I recently leased a Jeep Cherokee this past summer. It was my first Jeep/Chrysler product of any kind, and though I had reservations, they were all quickly put to rest. I test drove the Cherokee, and its two closest American rivals, the Chevy Blazer two door and the two door Ford Explorer, I was the most impressed with the Jeep.

The Cherokee I ended up with was the Sport model. It has a 4.0 liter in- line six cylinder engine, with 4WD. It came with all the basic options, keyless entry, A/C, Cruise, 6-CD changer, AM/FM cassette etc... It is truly a tight vehicle. Jeep has kept the same essential design on the Cherokee since its inception, and because of this, they have been able to refine all the bugs and customer complaints out of it. The inline six provides much more torque than the either the Explorer or the Blazer do. Compared to the Blazer the Cherokee seems to have a bit more &quot;zip&quot; to it. It has a tighter feel, tighter suspension, and quicker acceleration than both the Explorer and the Blazer. It cruises nicely on the highway at 90 - 100 mph.

In fact the only major complaint I would be able to post about the Cherokee is the rear seating. The bench-like rear seat does not offer much legroom for rear passengers, and is not very comfortable otherwise. This is really no concern for the driver, however, unless the driver is a soccer mom with lots of bratty little kids to haul around. The front seats are very comfortable, even on longer car trips.   <br><br>
