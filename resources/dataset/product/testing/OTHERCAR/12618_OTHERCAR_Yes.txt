            I have had this camera for approx <b>2 years</b> . It goes everywhere with me.

I find it very easy to use, strong , light (approx 9.5oz) and a  good size to pop into the pocket or bag. (4.1 x 2.7 x 1.3 inches)

Resolution is in pixels &#151&#150 large 1600 x 1200&#151&#150medium 1280 x 960 and small 800 x 600 , this means absolutely nothing to me! I&#146m a real dummy here! 
But I have played around with these a per instruction book to try and get the most images on the  8meg CF card you are provided with.. E.g. in Middle resolution in L compression 12 images, in M compression 18 images, in S compression 33 images.
I would rather Canon  had also put in the  max/min print sizes for each compression.

The Zoom of x2 I found really good but sometimes lost clarity on x4 &#151&#150 this of course may be user error and not the camera.

The operation panel took me no time at all to master ,(<b>WHEW!</b> Thank goodness!) and I found the <i>&#147Omni&#148</i> selector  easy to use. 

The other thing I liked was the view finder, when I brought this camera a lot of the other models on the market didn&#146t have one. I liked to have the option.

The timer mode has been used a great deal, especially at family gatherings and has worked so well at times I have had a number of prints to post away.

I have never had a problem with the capacity of the battery or the CF card because I simply brought an extra of each, and have found for a days outing 1 battery usually does it but it feels good to have that back up ready just in &#147case of &#147, and ditto for the CF card.

I have taken fabulous shots of insects and flower details using the <i>&#147macro mode&#148.</i>
There is also a built in warning if you get too close to the subject.

The continuous shooting mode I must admit to being abit of a failure at but somebody with a bit more flair than me would probably master this no problem.

I have used the <i>&#147stitch assist&#148</i> mode (joining a number of images together to get a panoramic shot). After trial and error I have perfected it to get really great images.
A little <b>TIP</b> here is to hold your camera in one place and move your body only &#151&#151not the camera.

Adjusting the setting for exposure, white balance or with the AE lock I found extremely easy.

Of course the magic of digital cameras is the ability to preview your image, erase it and retake it if necessary. In replay mode you can magnify, rotate, jump back and forwards, play as a slide show, mark for printing (in a definite order if you want) and view image information.

I also brought a CF card reader&#133 a good investment that I wouldn&#146t be with out&#151&#150so fast to download the images from the card to the computer.

The camera comes packaged with  a program called Zoombrowser, into which you download your images. From there you can edit them using Adobe or any other image editing software you prefer. In Zoom browser you can also store your images in &#147libraries&#148, handy if you are keeping large numbers stored, or view your images as slide shows.

You can print using Photo Record (also packaged) although I wish Canon had given us the Gold version of this as it is mush more versatile . However Photo Record lets you print images of  what ever size or number per page that want, and  with a variety of frames and backgrounds or none at all.

The instruction books are clear and very easy to understand with adequate illustrations.

I like this camera &#151&#150 it doesn&#146t have all the &#147whistles and bells&#148 that some other cameras have but a 2.11 mega pixels it has been a great little performer for me.

It hasn&#146t let me down yet!
