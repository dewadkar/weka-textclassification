            with my new altima!

I suppose I have to set up the scenario for you fine folks- ever since I crashed my mother's chevy station wagon (not my fault!!!!) I have been driving "clunkers".  First came the 1980 Chevy truck that got 1.5 miles per gallon.  Then came the "love of my life," a 1988 Buick Regal that I have to admit was fun to drive. I drove the Buick for six years.  

But recently the Buick began showing its age, leading me through two separate thousand dollar repair jobs in less than a month's time (still feeling the sting on my credit card bills).  In between repairs I began cruising the internet in search of what would be my next road companion, my next steed of the pavement.  

My search led me to about seven lightly used cars, camrys, altimas, and a mustang (prettttyyyyy).  I went in to the test-drive phase almost fanatically.  I was GOING to buy a car, no matter what. And I was GOING to do it THAT day.  (good thing I started early) I was a fiend as I headed to the used car lot (spending lots of money did that to me, the first time I spent $1000 on my old car, I went out and bought leather pants.  The second $1000 payment resulted in something much more drastic).

I got to Carmax to try the 2000 White Altima GXE at around 9 in the morning.  Within an hour, the car was mine.  The main reasoning for the decision was that the car simply felt good.  I expected it to feel light and bouncy (which is how everything else felt after the Buick), but it felt surprisingly substantial for its size.  It also had a lot more leg room than I expected to find (also hard to beat the Buick there).  It did not have the same "get up and go" that I had been used to, but I was not in the market for V-6 supercharged engines, so I let it go.  The car definitely has some "go" to it, nonetheless.

I made my decision right away, even though I had only test driven two used camrys before then.  I felt very confident in this car, and felt that it's slightly smaller size (than the Camry) gave it a little more verve as it had the same sized engine.  

The more I drive the Altima, the more I find I like it.  Though I miss the heaviness of my old car, and its bigger engine, I feel substantial in the new one, and very safe.  I have not driven it in winter yet, but word has it that it handles fairly well.  It has a lot to live up to in this regard, my old car could plow through eight inches of unplowed snow without wavering one inch to the right or left.  

The only problems I have with the car are that the seats are a little harder than I am used to (but not uncomfortable) and the steering wheel blocks some of the display (the engine temperature gauge).  The extras in the GXE model are exactly what I would have chosen- CD player, A/C, rear defrost, no exterior antenna (built in to rear window), sunglass holders, outlet for cell phone charger, extra compartment in armrest (perfect for registration and insurance information), fold-down back seats, and baby seat anchors (ok I may not have really thought about that, in buying a new car, but someday it might come in handy)

All in all I love this car.  It handles very well on curves, cruise control works very well, and it responds very quickly.  Excellent car for a good price.  I'm not sure I would buy it again, if I had more money I may go for a Maxima.  However, it was definitely the best decision I could have made for my money.  

(two thumbs up)
