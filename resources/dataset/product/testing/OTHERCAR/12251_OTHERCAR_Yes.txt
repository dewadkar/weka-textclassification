            When I met the love of my life on our first date about two months ago, it wasn't just her looks and charm that blew me away. Her black '99 Mitsubishi Galant was the best looking car in the parking lot, and despite the fact I suspected she had a hefty monthly payment along with insurance, it's like they say, sometimes you get more bang for your buck. With the new Galant, it's definitely the case.

This car handles real well, and the way this lady drives, it's been a lifesaver more than once. It stops and turns on a dime without undue bucking or jolting, and it's designed for good periphery in heavy traffic (she lives in Houston, go figure). 

The roominess is a big plus as well. You can ease the seat back for the long leisurely cruises, and it doesn't give you that cramped-up feeling you get in lots of foreign cars. Trunk space is great too; she moved to the Galleria area a couple of miles from her old place and we knocked the job out (with help of a U-Haul) in TWO trips. Yep, that black beauty of hers can hold quite a bit of luggage without serious ramming and cramming.
It's great on gas mileage as well. She visits me bi-monthly in San Antonio and uses under a tank for the 400-plus milelong trip. We cruised down to Galveston for Xmas, did the Westheimer/Montrose strip and took a spin around Loop 610 on less than half a tank. Downside is that she has to put that expensive super-premium stuff in, but she says the performance pays off and that's good enough for me.

All in all, it's a kickass-looking ride, real comfy, plenty of leg room, trunk space, great gas mileage. Plus Mitsubishi stands by its product, I hear, though I don't think she's gonna have to refer to her warranty for quite some time.<br><br>
