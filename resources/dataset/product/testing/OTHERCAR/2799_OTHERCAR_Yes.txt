            I have recently had the opportunity to purchase an Olympus D340-R. Before making this purchase, I had done extensive research, and had found through various opinions, that this is by far the best camera to buy for the money. Not only does it feature great resolution(1280x960), but the battery usage is very miserly. 

The camera I had before the Olympus was a Ricoh DC-4300, which got about 15-20 usable shots out of fresh alkalines before conking out. After getting my Olympus, I used the OLD alkalines that wouldn't work in the Ricoh. That was two weeks ago, and I'M STILL ON THE SAME SET OF BATTERIES!! 

Picture quality is also great, as the pictures turn out great indoors and out, as well as in low lit environments, where the automatic flash kicks in. Needless to say, this is a great camera. It takes great pictures, the trademark Olympus sliding lens cover switch is very convenient, and in picture taking mode, the LCD is automatically turned off to conserve batteries, yet another plus. 

I'd definitely recommend getting a Flash Path 3.5 floppy adapter, or better yet, a USB Smart Media reader (however, this costs extra money). It's too bad this camera doesn't have an optical zoom, or USB compatibility, but for 250-300 bucks, who cares? This camera gives the best bang for the buck, hands down.
