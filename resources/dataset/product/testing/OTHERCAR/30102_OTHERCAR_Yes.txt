            I did my homework: realized my needs and sought a product to match them. I'm not a professional photographer, so I knew I shouldn't spend a fortune. I wanted something I could use to take photos on vacations, something durable and easy to use, with excellent quality everyday pictures. When I compared the DC280 to other cameras with the same features I was astonished at the sub $400 price. It became the obvious choice for me.

I've been extremely pleased with the picture quality, with the caveat that the exposure must be adjusted to at least -0.5 in almost all settings to avoid over-bright pics. The colors and detail are incredible. It has a bit of a blur problem with motion and the digital zoom could be a little sharper. But in general, I find it nearly impossible to take a bad picture. Uploading via USB is fast and easy; viewing pics on a TV is a terrific thing. All in all, this is a great camera at a great price.

p.s. Hint: use the viewfinder to take your pics, then review them on the LCD. It's much easier that way.<br><br>
