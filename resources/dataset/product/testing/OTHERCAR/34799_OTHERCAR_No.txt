            I was surprised to see so many reviews praising this Sport Utility Vehicle.  Then again, most people are only inspired to write reviews when they first buy their product, before anything starts to go wrong.  Here's the truth about the Mitsubishi Montero:   

Engine/Transmission:
Most Mitsubishi Montero Sports are powered by a 3.0L V-6 gasoline engine.  While the vehicle may have a modern looking exterior, the engine is carry over from the Full-size Montero, where it was used between 1989 and 1997.  I have reason to suspect that the engine is built by the same company, Chrysler, as it was for the early 1990's Montero.  Since the Montero was a poor seller, the company (Mitsubishi) wanted to increase the power; because V-6 Mitsubishi Engines weren't viable, the company, which is a partner with Chrysler, used the Dodge Caravan's V-6 and dropped it in the Montero.  This same application was taken advantage of by Isuzu, with its Trooper II in the early 90's.  Isuzu used a V-6 variant of GM's 2.8, since GM owns over half of Isuzu. This application was woefully unreliable (see my Isuzu Trooper Review) and there's no evidence to prove that this application, in the Montero, will prove dependable.  The V-6 Chrysler Engine was developed for cars, thus explaining the Montero's leisurely acceleration (around 10.5seconds to 60mph), poor passing power.  The slothfulness of the engine if further impaired by the unresponsive automatic transmission, which is slow to downshift. 

Routine Use:
The Mitsubishi Montero provides a clean cabin area that is accentuated by fake wood trim and leather seating.  The front seats provide good support and legroom, but a very low roofline makes it difficult for anyone near, or over, 6feet tall.  Outward visibility is hindered by a very narrow and short windshield.  The space between the top of the windshield to the bottom can&#146t be anymore than 3feet in length, forcing all those that can see over the hood to crane there neck to see a stop light.  Those that can see a stop light cannot see over the hood!  A very high load floor makes lifting objects into the cargo bay straining.  With the rear seat nearly on the ground and lack of leg and foot room the rear seat is only comfortable for adults on short trips.  

Reliability
As stated above reliability is in question, because the power plant is a joint venture with Chrysler, which is notorious for engine problems. Another problem found upon inspection of the Montero we were going to buy was brakes.  All 4 brakes had been replaced, and the rear ones needed to be replaced again; all on a car with less than 50,000 miles.  It is my conjecture that Mitsubishi fitted the Montero Sport with inadequately small brakes as a cost-cutting measure; this would explain premature brake replacement. The other thing that prevented us from buying the Montero Sport was the transmission fluid was low.  

Last Words: 
In all honesty the Montero Sport is a cheap automobile. It was intended to be a profit vehicle from its production.  Mitsubishi, because of very slow sales of its larger Montero, spun off the Mitsubishi Montero Sport very cheaply, by recycling the old Mighty Max pickup&#146s frame. For further cost cutting measures Mitsubishi acquired a pre-existing inadequate Chrysler car engine for this 2 ton plus SUV, resulting in poor performance.  If you are thinking that repairs on your Montero Sport will be cheap, think again.  Even though the Sport has a Yank engine, it must be serviced by a Mitsubishi dealer, because of the mechanisms that surround the engine are Japanese: a recipe for disaster.  

If you are considering a mid-sized SUV I&#146d recommend a used Toyota Highlander, a used Toyota 4 Runner, a used Hyundai Santa Fe, or a used Honda Pilot. Please remember to always have your car inspected by a third party before purchase.
