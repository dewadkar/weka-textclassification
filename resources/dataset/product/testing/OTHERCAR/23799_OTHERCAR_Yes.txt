            Now that I'm going to go to college in a year, my parents decided that it was time for me to get a good, reliable car.  When we began our search, we had no intentions of buying the car for at least a few more months but after looking at Sentras, Corollas and Elantras, we fell upon this new car.  I could not believe my ears when I heard the price.  It was less expensive than much older cars it looks like, such as a Jetta.  I took it for a test drive, instead of the Corollas my dad had in mind, and we both decided that we had to have this car.  After we specified what we were looking for, including a five speed, the stereo option of a CD player and the cool black color, the car was in within three days.  It gets great gas mileage(34 miles per gallon in the city) and is very comfortable.  My parents even think its safe enough for me to take it to the beach.
I recommend this car for nearly everybody, especially those who need the room for going to college but can't spend the money on an SUV.  If you have a big family, though, I'm sure you'd be better off with a van.  It's got room but it's still a car. <br><br>
