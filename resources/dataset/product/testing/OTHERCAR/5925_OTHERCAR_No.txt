            I have a 1991 Cherokee Laredo 4WD, and it has served me well on- and off-road.  I shall assume that you are looking for a capable and strong SUV, not just a grocery-getter.

This vehicle is the best off-road SUV for the money, with solid axles, a strong engine (the inline six-cyl 4.0 - avoid the wimpy smaller engines). There are newsgroups, websites and plenty of aftermarket vendors to help you do suspension lifts and other mods to improve its off-road prowess even further. 

However, I learned after buying mine that this model year suffers from some major factory defects (some of which can be fixed under recall, some of which are unfixable). To summarize:

- 1990-1992 Cherokees with anti-lock (ABS) brakes have a dangerous  ABS system, even after it has been fixed under recall. When the ABS system loses pressure, you will lose all power-assist on the brakes. There have been accidents, and a big class action lawsuit over this. 

- early '90s Cherokees (and Dodge minivans) were poorly painted, resulting in flaking clearcoat.  More lawsuits and buybacks. (I just had mine repainted across the border in Tijuana). 

- early '90s Cherokees with the 4.0L (six-cyl) engine suffer from &quot;piston slap&quot; due to poor tolerances in the engine. At idle it sounds like a &quot;glack-glack-glack&quot; sound. Probably harmless except for the resale value of a noisy vehicle. This &quot;feature&quot; was remedied in the 4.0 in later years. 

Just my luck -  my '91 Cherokee (bought 1994) had all these problems, and has needed a fair amount of other repair work typical for a US-made vehicle of that era. (e.g. At 130k miles I've been through 2 water pumps, two radiators, 2 complete brake overhauls and various electrical glitches, plus an oil leak in the rear main seal). At least repair costs and replacement parts are fairly cheap, compared to the Japanese counterparts. 

The automatic transmission and Selec-Trac full-time 4WD system have proven to be bullet-proof, however - I would recommend both. 

My advice to you - do yourself a favor and buy a Cherokee from 1995 or later to avoid these problems, and you'll get an airbag and improved side-impact protection thrown in. When my current Cherokee bites the dust, this is what I shall do, unless gas prices rise even further. (The Cherokee gets a miserable 14-16mpg around town, and even less if lifted or carrying extra load).
