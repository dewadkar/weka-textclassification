            I bought this camera largely due to reviews on this site. I thought it would be a good purchase for my first digital camera. I was looking for a small camera with good quality pics I could transfer to my computer. I wasnt looking to print any, so this seemed to be a good camera for my price range.

Some positives I found about it was, for the price, it seemed to take some quality pics if I was in really good light. But, if the lighting wasnt the best, the pics werent either. The flash seemed to be too strong and hurt more than helped. It made all the pictures of my friends in a lower light have their faces with blueish purple hue for some reason and made their faces rather unflattering. Maybe their was some way I could have fixed it, but I didnt find much for customizing settings. Another thing I didnt like was that there was no optical zoom (and I soon found how pointless digital zoom is when trying to get closer at a concert). It is a very simple point and shoot camera that works best in good lighting, and if thats what you want, then get it, especially if your budget is limited. If you have some extra money though, it will be worth it to get optical zoom. I returned the Samsung and now have a Canon A60 coming in the mail now that I bought off of eBay for not much more than I spent on this camera new.
