            Overall, our 1992 Trans Sport has been a great vehicle, and shows every sign of continuing to serve us well.  It has been reliable and extremely practical.

The sleek styling was an attention-getter when it first came out (this review's title quotes the first reaction of one of the kids at church).  However, the design of the 1992 Trans Sport's nose and windshield is its worst feature.  The top of the dashboard is extremely deep.  It's hard to wash the inside of the windshield, and you can't see the front of the vehicle.  At first, I backed into parking spaces because it was easier to judge the location of the rear bumper than that of the front bumper.  Also, the windshield requires a second support pillar, which obscures the driver's forward-left view a bit more than normal.  Later models changed this design; their appearance isn't as distinctive, but they're probably a little safer.

One of the first things we noticed about the Trans Sport was the roomy interior.  There's plenty of legroom up front, both in depth (for long legs) and in breadth (to move your feet around, or to store something on the floor between the front passenger's feet).  There's enough room between the front seats to allow people to make their way to the back fairly easily.

This minivan's seating design is extremely flexible.  Each of the 5 rear seats detaches separately.  That makes it easy for one person to reconfigure its seating unassisted, and it's easy to adjust the seating/storage arrangements to suit different situations.  With all the seats installed, there's room for 7 people (including the driver), but not much storage space (unless everyone's small enough that the middle and rear seats can be installed in the forward position).  With the 2 rear seats removed, there is room for 5 people and plenty of cargo.  With the right-rear and right-middle seats removed, there's seating for 5 and room to store a couple bicycles along the right side.  With all 5 seats removed, there's plenty of room for large objects.  And so on.

Our Trans Sport has been reliable.  We've made a few unscheduled trips to the garage, but nothing major--a dead alternator, a dead starter, a couple flat tires--just things you'd expect occasionally after several years of driving.

The plastic body panels are great.  They've taken a bit of abuse on occasion, but they don't show it at all.  However, if you need to have it towed, the magnetic taillights will stick only to the narrow steel panel right above the rear hatch-style door.

The 3.2-liter engine in our Trans Sport is adequate.  You definitely notice the difference in handling when you're carrying a full load of passengers/cargo, but you still get where you're going.  And it gets good mileage for a vehicle its size.

The dashboard is clear and easy to read.  The controls are easy to reach and operate.  The driving position is relatively high, affording a good view of the road.  You don't have to climb up into the Trans Sport (as you do with SUVs and full-sized vans), nor do you have to lower yourself into it (as you do with many small and mid-sized cars).  ABS is standard, and ours came with cruise control, power windows, power locks, and similar features.

Our Trans Sport has met our needs very well.  It has been reliable and practical, and even with 100k miles on it, it's still doing great.
