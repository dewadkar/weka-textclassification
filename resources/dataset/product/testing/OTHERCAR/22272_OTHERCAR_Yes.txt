            My wife and I finally decided to buy a good digital camera.  We'd had a Polaroid digital camera and liked it ok, but we hated that it seemed to eat batteries with a passion.  So we broke down and invested in a Sony.

I'd used friends' Mavica' previously and liked the image quality.  But I only wanted one if I could get it with the CD in it.

We waited until Best Buy offered their digital cameras for 0% interest (18 months, in this case) and made our purchase.  So far, the results have been great!

We've probably taken somewhere around 500 images (mostly of our son) so far.  The images are great.  In the highest resolution (1600x1200) and quality (fine), the camera will hold about 130 images on one CD.  This is an amazing feat.  Our old digital camera would run out of battery power before it could fill up it's internal memory.  This camera has Sony's famous rechargeable Info-Lithium battery.  It lasts a LONG time.

The MVC-CD250 also takes short MPEG videos.  This is a nice feature, but really only works in brightly-lit areas.  We took a few short ones indoors of our boy playing and you can barely see them on the screen.  It's not a deal-breaker, but if you really want digital video, get a digital video camera.

The "Flash-3" mode is interesting.  It takes three pictures in quick succession.  Once again, the images are a little dark when compared to a standard image, but if you're taking pictures out-of-doors, it's a nice feature.

Downloading is a snap.  Just plug in the provided USB cable and download it to your computer.  Then, the images can be read by any good imaging program (I use Paperport 8.0 to download and Microsoft Image Composer to manipulate the images for desktop wallpapers, etc.)

The clarity of the images is so good, that I have a closeup of our son on my computer desktop at work that is full screen (1600x1200) and looks great.

You can also take the CD from the camera and use it in most computer CD-ROM drives to directly access the images.  This, sometimes, is the quicker method for image viewing.
