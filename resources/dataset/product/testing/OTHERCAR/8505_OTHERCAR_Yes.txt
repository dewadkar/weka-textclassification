            If you don't want to spend money on a new car, then don't test drive the new Jetta Wagon. Especially not the 1.8-liter turbo engine. I can assure you that you won't walk out of the dealership without it. Although it costs a bit more than other wagons in its class, you get so much in terms of neat features and safety add-ons that all the money you spend on this smooth and functional vehicle is worth it.

I got the GLS trim with 1.8T, perhaps the best value if you want to get some extra horsepower without splurging on the V6. In fact, the new turbo engine has more horses than the V6, at least until the spring of 2002, when Volkswagen will roll out the new V6 engine. Until then, those who like to feel a little more control on the roads, especially on the freeway will appreciate the ride that the 1.8T engine gives.

The wagon comes with standard driver and passenger front air bags. But it's also equipped with side airbags that come out of the side seams of the front seats, plus curtain airbags that protect the people in the back and come out of the top of car. This alone should give the safety-minded driver an excellent incentive. A feature called ASR, or anti-slip regulation, detects and minimizes wheel slippage. (You can turn it off from the ASR button on the dash.) The keys that the dealer gives you are really cool, ultra-secure, small black rectangular blocks that flip the key open at the push of a tiny silver button. The keys are coded to your car, so if someone happens to steal one of them, you only need to go to the dealer to have them recoded so that the stolen keys get invalidated. (It will cost quite a lot, however, so I hope to never lose any.) And if you are going to test drive, turn on the lights and see how excellent the colors are on the display panels. The purple numbers and luminous, bright red dials are simply too cool for words. You have to see this one feature in person.

The 1.8T GLS has an optional Tiptronic transmission, which allows you to shift both automatically and manually, though the manual transmission is not exactly like a real manual transmission. Still, because it's so easy to overspeed with this zippy car, the Tiptronic in manual helps to keep your speed in check when you're in residential neighborhoods. Beyond that, it also adds extra oomph when you're passing others on the freeway. This is certainly an optional feature, but if you've got the extra bucks, go ahead and splurge. It will be the same engine as the Audi 1.8Ts.

The engine does exhibit some lag in the lower gears. Particularly when you're entering the freeway, you may feel a second or so wait before the power kicks in on the turbo engine. However, once you reach the 40s or 50s, the engine only provides pure horsepower, not to mention sheer pleasure. Also: don't believe the sticker's mileage claim of 22 city/29 highway. It may be true if you drive very slowly and never step on the gas too quickly. But if you do (and I certainly do), the mileage comes closer to 18 mpg on side streets. I took a long drive of about 400 miles and I got better mileage, but I still don't believe it's 29. It's probably closer to 25 or so. And you will need premium gas for the turbo engine, so you should take that into consideration if you're watching your gas budget.

The Jetta Wagon seems to be a rarity for now. I see a lot of Passat Wagons, because they're better for families. The back seats can be cramped, especially if passenger and/or driver are tall. But they're adequate for short rides or average-sized adults. Still, this is a single person's or couple-without-kids' wagon. It's sporty and roomy in the back. The Jetta comes close to luxury without your having to spend $40K or more. I have fabric seats, but I'm sure the leather is even more posh.

I highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a wagon. It may be more than others in its class, such as the Ford wagon, but you get much, much more in terms of feature, plus a drive that's unquestionably German.
