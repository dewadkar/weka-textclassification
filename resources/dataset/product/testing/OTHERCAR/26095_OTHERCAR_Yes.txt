            I wanted a digital camera.  I don't know how many Epinions reviews I read or how many electronic stores and websites I visited (many, many) during my search for a relatively inexpensive, tricked-out camera.  All the cameras I saw fell into two categories: cheap with no resolution and no bells and whistles, or super-duper expensive.  I would have loved to get one of the big Sony Mavica's with the floppy disk slot, but they all neared $1000.  So I researched other image storage methods and decided that the second-best kind had the Compact Flash memory cards.  These, at least, were ubiquitous, could be upgraded, and were removable.

Fine, I knew I wanted a digital camera with Compact Flash capabilities.  And I wanted one for under $400.

What else did I want?  Zoom.  A LED video display panel.  Various types of photographic options (black and white, panorama).  Various resolution possibilities.  High resolution that I could transfer to prints.

And definitely rechargeable batteries, since I know how much power digital cameras can eat up.

But all the cameras under $400 didn't have nearly the kinds of high resolution I wanted.  I didn't want one of those $199 models that only has 640 x 480 pixel resolution, suitable for nothing but fuzzy Ebay snapshots of products.  Most of the cheap ones don't even include a flash!  (And I have a tendency to live at night.)  All the cameras with everything I wanted seemed to be at least $700.  There was no lower mid-range.  I thought I would have to wait a few more years for the prices to drop radically.

But then I saw the Epson 750z on sale on Amazon for $370. I jumped at it.  It has everything I've listed that I wanted--even a battery recharger.  It comes with a 8MB Compact Flash Memory card, and another 8MB built-in to the camera.  That gives me more than 120 shots at the lowest setting--more than I would have if I just brought regular camera film with me on a trip.  The super-high settings have great resolution (Superfine: 1280 x 960, HyPict: 1600 x 1200), although they do eat up the memory much faster.  I'm thinking of buying a 64MB memory card, which will give me enormous room to play around.  I also vary the resolution for different pictures--the memory allows you to store whatever sizes and types of pictures on the same card.

The flash works very well, and has a great automatic setting that hasn't misled me yet.  The pictures themselves have been crystal clear, and look wonderful up on my website.  The bundled software makes it easy to upload the pictures to my computer (although pictures on my hard drive take up an insane amount of space).  It even comes with a variety of wires to hook up to different types of computers.  The software also includes a pretty decent photo editor, to adjust the contrast/brightness/etc.  Surprisingly, the rechargeable batteries last a really long time, even when using the LED video screen.  I've only had to recharge them once in the last two months--and they stayed charged for the entirety of my last 10-day vacation.

I also like the built-in timer, so I can be in my own pictures. I also like the nifty shoulder bag case for the camera and the battery charger.  It's quite attractive.

Overall, the camera is stylish and pretty lightweight.  The buttons are relatively intuitive, and the flip-through menus on the LED screen are simple to navigate.  (I love that you can flip through the pictures you've already taken while you're away from your computer, and delete the ones that came out not quite as good as the others.)  The camera is also pretty sturdy, and came on a camping trip with me (and to the beach) with no problems whatsoever.

I should also mention that Epson's warranty is wonderful.  When the camera first arrived, it didn't work at all, so I called Epson and they told me to send it to them.  It came back UPS in two weeks in perfect working condition for no extra charge (other than postage).
 
There are a few minor negatives with the Epson 750z, which I can deal with because of the reasonable price.  The shutter speed is pretty slow, so I have to keep the camera very steady, especially at night, or lights leave trails.  That slow shutter speed also takes away some of the fun of spontaneous pictures--it's easy to miss something that's moving fast.  The zoom works well, but the lever that controls it isn't very responsive, and it takes a few seconds to kick in.  And the non-digital viewfinder is great for saving batteries by avoiding using the LED screen, but it doesn't feel all that comfortable against your eye and face.  Also, the package doesn't include an AC adapter, which costs extra.  The camera will NOT accept any generic AC adapters--only the Epson adapter for an additional $39.  

Still, those problems seem very minor when I remember that I've got an excellent digital camera that I could actually afford.  At long last, my search is over.
