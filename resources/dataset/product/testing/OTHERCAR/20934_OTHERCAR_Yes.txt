             Chrysler had to have something different to re-capture the American car buyers attention. The PT Cruiser seems to have done just that and more.
 The cruiser is very unique in so many ways. One of them is the seating configuration. If you need seating for 2 with a lot of cargo space, simply pull the back seat out and there you are. if you need just a seat for the driver, and you have purchased the limited touring edition, you are able to lay the passenger front seat flat and have now increased the cargo space even more.
 I like the &quot;tray&quot; in the back. there are so many uses for this and I have tried every one. If you need to carry plants in the back, and we all know how big a mess they can create, just flip the tray over, and there you have a rubberized tray that you can set the plants on and not worry about the mess on the carpet.
 If you are going to go to the big game, and want to &quot;tailgate&quot; you are in luck. when you put the tray in the top position, it is easily accessible to use for the food, drinks or whatever you are having.
 The engine is a very capable dohc 4 cylinder that is powerful enough to merge onto the beltway in DC during rush hour. That should speak for itself. The comfort of ride is unequaled in any of the smaller cars that it is compared to. The rear suspension keeps the sway factor very low and helps in cornering.
 The seats can be in leather or cloth and are high back bucket seats. Very comfortable even on long trips. The back seats are very comfortable and there is enough leg room for people who are 6 foot tall. That in itself is one of the biggest benefits of this vehicle.
 The largest drawback is the availability. Unfortunately, Chrysler blew it by not being able to keep up supply with the demand for the vehicle. With the new CEO, possibly this will change. Currently, if you order one, you will wait anywhere for 4 months to 6 months for delivery.<br><br>
