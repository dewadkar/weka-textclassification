            This is a great digital camera.  I like it so well, I have 2 for my business.  I am in Real Estate and am always photographing properties.  I have another more expensive digital camera by about 3 times, and it is actually less reliable than the PDC 640.

This works well in almost any light and you can edit your photos if need be.  It is basically a click and shoot camera.  The viewfinder can be used or just look through the lens like a 35 mm.  Children can take good photographs with this camera.

Downloading the photos is also easy.  It takes very little time.  The program that comes with this camera is as user friendly as the camera.  This is the one to get your non technical relatives who don't think they will understand anything about computers.  

Shop around and find a deal on this one.  My second one was purchased for less than $200. <br><br>
