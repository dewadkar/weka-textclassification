              My 1997 Pontiac Sunfire Sedan is gone, and nobody has an explanation for this. I first purchased my Sunfire at a local Pontiac dealer that was having an end of the year close out sale. I looked over the car and loved the price and the features. The car ran great and if you look at my previous review about the Pontiac Sunfire, you will see the pros and cons about it.

  I am here to tell you all exactly how this car came to be a heap of expensive garbage and to warn you about some of the security features that Pontiac claims are so great.

  I first started noticing that my radio system with, a built in cd player, started dimming when it was in the heat for awhile. In Texas there is no escape from the heat! I had this car for 2 years and the mileage had barely hit the manufacturers warranty limit, so that was a lost cause!

  Finally, it happened, 100 miles after my warranty ran out the car was locked. I called Pontiac and asked them why my car would not start. They asked me what the problem was and I told them that I thought it was the radio. See the radio is the cars alarm feature. When I first bought the vehicle, I had to enter an ID number into the radio so in case the radio was ever stolen, the car would be disabled. Well My car was disabled and no one touched the radio.

  They told me to bring the car in and they would fix it for free. I agreed and had the car towed to Pontiac. I left the car there and called about 3 hours later and was very concerned about what they had to say. They said that they were in the middle of fixing my vehicle and asked for my permission to continue. Of course thinking that the problem was simple but maybe they were over stocked with cars, I gave the o.k and said I would pick it up in 2 days. On many occasions it was about 2 days so I just mentioned 2 days.

  2 days later, I am at Pontiac and looking at my car, totally disassembled and laid out everywhere! I was so shocked. I asked to speak to someone immediately and was taken to their main office. They explained that by some freak accident,(and I quote) the car threw a rod and blew the whole motor to nothing! I know nothing about cars, that is my husband's job, so I called him and told him to speak with this guy. My husband asked why they didn't tell him about this 2 days ago. And guess what they said... yes we told your wife and she said we should work on it. The car was not even 2 years old it shouldn't have happened. 

  I have been writing Pontiac and plan to win this one. I did let the car get reposessed because they wanted $3,000.00 in order to finish the work on it or (get this) I could have it for $346.98 but I would have to get it towed from there(with the engine in the trunk) and it would never work again. The motor had metal in it and I had a mechanic check it out. He said he wouldn't pay them a dime for it!

  Needless to say it was money down the drain and now to top it off I have bad credit. They have recently sent me the remaining statement. They have auctioned the car off for $1000.00 and I am liable for the remaining $8,000.00.

  <b>Buyers beware of this scam</b> I have never heard a story like mine about the 1997 Pontiac Sunfire but where there is one incident, a similiar one can follow. See my first review, before it bit the dust!
