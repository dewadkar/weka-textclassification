            I bought my 96 T&C LXI in 99 with 63K miles on it.  Since then we have put only 33K miles on it and have had to spend about 3K in maintenance.  Most recently the rear main seal went out, which ruined the crankshaft.  This was a $1500 repair.  Prior to that a bolt came loose around the transmission causing a tremendous squeal.  This was another $500 to repair.

The AC has had problems and leaks.  It currently has a freon leak somewhere behind the dash.  We haven't fixed this one yet.  Also, the transmission has leaked and required a major repair to fix.

Electrically there are several problems.  The service engine light turns on intermittently.  The mechanics cannot determine the cause.  The wipers sometimes turn on by themselves.  The turn signals will fail to work at all, about 25% of the time.  The CD player controls do not work well.  Skipping a track on the CD player usually turns on the radio.

During the winter, if you go down a steep hill, the car will come out of gear and not go back in until you move in and out of Drive several times.

The most dangerous feature:  You can move the car from Park to Drive or Reverse without putting your foot on the brake.  A child can easily bump the gearshift and get the van moving.  Holy Cow, that is amazing from the so-called leader in mini-vans.

I think I can get another 50K miles from the van, but I will need another $10K to do it!!!
