            After trading in a Prism(great car also) I got a '99 Cavalier(in '98) The only thing bad about it is the color (Fern Green Metallic) It was the only one on the lot with a CD player that was two doors.

I have 28,000 miles on it already and only have had to do oil changes and rotate the tires. It is solid sounding for a compact. Drives nice and is comfortable. The factory tires are great for a little box.

Three of my family members also own cavaliers, two of them are repeat buyers. One of them hit a gas pump (that's right, a gas pump.) and only had minor paint damage. It is great for single people, the back seats leave a little to be desired. 

The battery is also very reliable, I drive with my lights on all the time (to get rid of the annoying 'running light' alert on the dash board.) and when I first got the car I tended to leave the lights on a lot, the car would always start, but would let me know that I left the lights on (by starting a little less than willingly!)<br><br>
