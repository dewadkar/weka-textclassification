            The new discovery series is a wonderful vehicle.  All the other write ups are for on road driving so this is about the off road driving.  It is the best so far.  It has a very impressive four wheel drive system that allows for the vehicle to move with very minimal traction.  I have had the opportunity to do some fun off road driving and i have been very happy with the results.  I didn't opt for the wench which is something that i would have liked to have, but there has not been a single instance that i could have used it.  The four wheel drive has always pulled through.  I am also impressed with the water crossing capabilities as well as the ground clearance.  The people at land rover put the differentials on the same side so that there is a good 10 inches of ground clearance under the drivers side from the front to the rear.  In all it is very impressive and i would recommend it to anyone who would like to adventure.  The down side is the fuel consumption due to the weight and the full time four wheel drive...
***note, for drives over 6ft, like myself the drivers side gets cramped on long road trips.
***also, the cup holder are for soda can sized drinks so if you have a coffe mug it wont fit in the front cup holder (you have to use the ones in the back)
