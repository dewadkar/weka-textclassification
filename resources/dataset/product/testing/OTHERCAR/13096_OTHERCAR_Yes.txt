            After owning a 1995 Honda LX Coupe for two years, it was not much of a hard choice to make when I decided to purchase a new car.
1999 Honda EX V6 Coupe is everything I wanted in a sporty automobile.
The inside interior is designed superbly, VTEC V6 engine featured for the first time in these cars is more than &quot;gutsy&quot;, the handling is a bit choppy but the over all comfort of the ride makes up for it.
As I was debating over buying a Lexus ES 300 or a BMW 318, what caught my eye and was later a deciding factor in making the right choice, was the fact that the Honda offered many exciting features as a part of a package, which were considered optional with other car makers.  These include: a CD player, automatic climate control, leather interior, power moonroof, remote keyless entry and many others that would come at a high price with the more luxurious car brands- unless you are one of those who thinks: &quot;I will look better in a Beamer no matter the cost!&quot;

The EX V6 comes loaded with the 200 horsepower, 195lb. ft of torque VTEC engine, (more than any BMW under $40,000) 16'' wheels, all power leather interior, automatic climate control, CD player, an excellent 6 speaker  sound system, moonroof, auto-off headlights, keyless entry and much more.

The gas consumption is ample at 21mpg/city and 24mpg/highway.  Even though the acceleration is well appreciated, I still think that a pickup ought to be more pronounced and less &quot;delayed&quot; as one would expect for a 3 liter engine.
The ride is comfortable and quiet even when driving long distances- a bit choppy in corners and noisy at sharp turns- this is not a vehicle you want to race your friends Camaro in!
If you have an extra grand, definitely invest it in buying a body kit- you car will repeatedly turn heads as you cruse down the road.
For less than $25,000 I strongly believe that the EX V6 is the best buy in its category.
