            Hewlett-Packard came through with the C200. Ease of use, reliabilty, a solid frame, and top quality digital images are all a part of the package. The camera is fully automatic, so you can basically point and shoot. Not happy with that take, take another. A digital camera is like having a Poloroid, since you can review your photo right after taking it. Got loved ones? E-Mail your favorite images on-line with the easy to use included software. I find this camera most useful for my business. I throw hip-hop concerts and to make flyers, I'll use images from a live show, insert them into PhotoShop, and create and manipulate a brand new show flyer. For examples of this work visit www.darksideproductions.net. I tried the others, but they didn't equal the quality or ease of use. This seemed the best buy, and the name of the company is reliable enough. If you want affordabilty and ease of use choose the C200. Most of all, if you want quality pictures this is your camera.<br><br>
