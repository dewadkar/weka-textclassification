            At first glance this car resembles the more heralded SL-series that has been the benchmark for style and luxury in the convertible class.  But take a closer look and one will quickly learn that the car designed in the vision of the classic mercedes roadsters of yesteryear is nothing short of breathtaking.  
The retractable hard-top clearly sets the SLK apart from its competition... namely the porsche boxster and the bmx Z3.  The retractable hardtop, which is a marvel to watch as it disappears into the trunk in less than one minute, is great for those who want the security and the convenience of a hardtop.  
While porsche and bmw offer hard-tops for their respective roadster... their tops need to be stored and don't look natural on the cars. 
The SLK also offers a better driving experience than the Z3 or the Boxster.  Simply put, the boxster is noisy.  A dealer told me that most people enjoy the &quot;growl&quot; of the boxster.  The &quot;growl&quot; however sounds more like a whine as the car emits a harsh, high pitched reverberation that makes the driver cringe.  The Z3 can be described as miniature version of the batmobile, with its unique styling.  While the Z3 is a thrill to drive with a marvelous manual transmission... it does not offer the same luxury of the SLK and does not out perform the boxster unless equipped with the motorsport pagkage.
If there is a flaw with the Mercedes SLK, it lies in the fact that the SLK is not a true sports car.  When equipped with the sports package(which I strongly recommend) the roadster is sure footed and can handle the sharpest of turns.  Its weakness lies in in the turbo-charged but nonetheless underpowered engine.  The 4-cylinder engine that comes in the base model SLK doesn't deliver on the promise of a true sports car.  Mercedes has introduced a 6 cylinder engine that puts out more than enough power to transform the SLK from a sleek but underpowered roadster to a full-fledged driving experience that rivals that of the aforementioned boxster.
In short, the Mercedes SLK is a blend of both style and luxury... but if your are looking for a true sports car, one would be better served to either look to the six cylinder model(SLK320) or consider the: Porsche Boxster, Honda S2000, or the BMW M-roadster.  <br><br>
