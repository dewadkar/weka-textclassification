                  This car has been made to perfection. Even the past models of the Toyota Supra have been powerful, sexy and well enginered. The Japanese have a great theory. Instead of completly redesigning a car every year like americans, they improve bit by bit. This means that the quality flys up because they learn from their mistakes. This perfection idea has been a gift from god. The version next year will be improved more and more. Normaly I like old cars that I can make better and fit my needs, but the Toyota Supra caught my eye. This car is most likey the most souped up car on the road.  Almost every Supra I see has something that is upgraded.  This shows how much people love their cars.  It had what I was looking for in a car. Overall it will beat out all americans cars and will edge out those from Japan and the rest of Asia. And you can never forget a price so low for a car so nice.
