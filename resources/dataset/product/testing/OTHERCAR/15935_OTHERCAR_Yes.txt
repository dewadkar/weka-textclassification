            I finally broke down and purchased a digital camera.  I searched and searched and eventually found one that was in my price range and seemed to be well received according to most of the reviews I had read.

To start with the price is right!  At $240 retail the Epson PhotoPC 650 is priced well below most digital cameras out there.  I will caution you that I found it as high as $320.  Just keep looking and eventually you will find a reputable dealer who is offering it at a reasonable price.

This camera is easy to use.  I was able to &quot;master&quot; it in about a day thanks to the excellent users guide that came with it.  Contents include step by step instructions on how to get started, take pictures, adjust image quality, load pictures to your PC via USB or serial cable, viewing pictures on the TV, recording them to VHS tapes, and much more.

The following is included with your initial purchase:

- 8MB USB Compact Flash Card
- Jumpshot USB Cable
- Video Cable
- Mac Adapter Cable
- Serial Cable
- Imaging Software
- Hand Strap 
- Four AA Alkaline Batteries

Optional equipment is also available.

Taking pictures is very easy. Be prepared though to take the same picture several times until you get the color and lighting just right. The color can also be adjusted with the imaging software included.  The best thing about digital is that you can take as many pictures as you need to get the shot since there is no film to buy.  Additionally the camera has four image quality settings. The finer the setting the fewer pictures your memory can hold.

Standard     - 88 pictures
Fine         - 47 pictures
Superfine    - 30 pictures
Uncompressed - 4 pictures

I found that Fine is sufficient for most of my pictures.

For beginners and casual users this camera does not have many drawbacks,  but I would be irresponsible if I did not mention the batteries.  You need to keep fresh batteries available because this thing can eat them like Tic-Tacs, depending on your usage.  Which brings us back to the optional equipment.  I would strongly encourage anyone buying this camera to look into getting a battery charger and some rechargeable batteries, possibly even purchasing the AC adapter for use when showing pictures on TV or recording them onto VHS tapes.

To conclude I am very happy with this camera and would recommend it to beginners, casual users, or anyone simply wanting to get a few good pictures onto the net.<br><br>
