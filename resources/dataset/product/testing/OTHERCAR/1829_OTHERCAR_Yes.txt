            My husband and I bought our 1994 Grand Marquis almost 2 years ago.  We bought it because of the size and comfort it gave us.  It has been a good car and rides great.  It has always been reliable and trustworthy.  The only think I can think of that we hate about this car is the miles we are putting on it.  They just add up so fast.  We have taken it on long trips and it gets very good gas mileage and is also very comfortable to ride in.  We are very happy with this car and in the future hope to get another one.  <br><br>
