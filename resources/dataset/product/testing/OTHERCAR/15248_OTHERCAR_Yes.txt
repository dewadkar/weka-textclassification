<TEXT>
            My Grand Am is fairly old.  I have problems with sometimes, but I guess that's to be expected with a 1991 (I bought it in 1995).  One thing I must say is that it gets great gas mileage.  I get about 25+ miles to the gallon on road trips.  So gas is pretty cheap for me.  I probably won't keep it much longer because it's almost 10 year old.  Time for something newer.  But overall, it's done pretty well throughout the 4 or 5 years I've had it.  It's pretty comfortable and has a few options such as cruise control.  But over time, it has lost some of the power that it had when I first bought it.  I wanted a 6-cylinder, but decided to go with the 4 because it had such good power.  No, it doesn't.  But I can't complain too much, I've had two wrecks in it and come out unhurt (neither were my fault for the record).  So I can't complain much.  It's treated me pretty well over the years.<br><br>
