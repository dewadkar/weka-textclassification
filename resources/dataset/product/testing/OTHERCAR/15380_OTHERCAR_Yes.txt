            This is by far the best digital camera for the money. The key reasons I state this are the ease of use, clarity, MPEG mode, ruggedness and media format.

I enjoy using this camera so much that I had my company purchase several for field use (I am out here in the desert).

The simple floppy media allows even the most timid computer user to simply insert the disc and bring up the photos or movies.

Several advances have only improved this camera.  The extra long LI battery and the &quot;Memory Stick&quot; adapter.  The latter nearly allowing up to 400 1280 x 740 jpeg pictures to be stored.

Yes, this camera is larger, and a bit more costly.  But due to its ease of use, no requirements for external cords  or adapters, and the use of Floppies for media, this is your best bet.<br><br>
