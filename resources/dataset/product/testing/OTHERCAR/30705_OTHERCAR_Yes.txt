            I love my Sunfire. It is terrific. I bought this vehicle in 1999. My husband was overseas and my car had just broke down. I had a 1992 Pontiac Sunbird. It was a great car, it was used and had over 200,000 miles on it. I was so set on getting another Pontiac. So, I went out and bought this one. I got a 2 door silver one with, a sunroof and a CD player. It rides smooth. You can't even hear it running when your stopped. The CD player and the radio sounds great with it's 6 speakers. This car is not for someone with a big family. The one thing it does have for kids, is the Carseat straps in the back. Certain Carseat's have long straps, they go around these hooks that are in the back. The seats fold down to make more room in the trunk. But, with or without the seats down, the trunk is very roomy. The entire car is roomy. I will have this car for a long time. <br><br>
