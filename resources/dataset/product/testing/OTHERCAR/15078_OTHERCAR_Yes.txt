            As an avid traveler I wanted a way I could take pictures on my trips without the expense and hassle of having to get them developed before I could see them. It was then that I decided upon a digital camera. It didn't take me long to settle on the Sony FD-73 digital camera. It has all the features that I need in a camera without the major cost associated with most of today's cameras. With proven durability (I dropped mine on cement)and easily the best method of file access Sony has definitely created a proven winner with this one. This camera is so easy to use that anyone who wants to take good pictures quickly and easily would be bettering themselves and their photographic opportunities by purchasing a camera like this one. The best photographs that I have ever taken have been done with this camera. I no longer fear taking pictures and neither should you.<br><br>
