            To be perfectly honest the guy at the WalMart told me the Olympus 360 was the better camera to buy. So I bought it and now I'm so glad I felt adventurous and believed him.
When  one is considering buying an item of this sort you begin to question your sanity so that before you know it questions of whether you really need it begin to enter in. The one overiding rational thought to counter your questions of your sanity is this. This Olympus camera is a GREAT little camera. Even Q in the 007 movies  would be found  saying Gee Whiz upon looking at all the fine little qualities Olympus has packed into for even the novice beginning photog  can soon master. This summer at my daughters High School graduation ceremony the students were walking the gauntlet of parents in a procession to the stage. My daughter came walking by and waved at me so i quickly found her in the camera picture frame and snapped a shot. I thought oh gosh  this won't turn out but when I got home and downloaded the frames to the computer to process...there she was  smiling and happy; so was I. The included software is also very very powerful and I would say rivals Paint Shop Pro in useability.
