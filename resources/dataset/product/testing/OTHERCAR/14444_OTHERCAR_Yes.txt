            I just purchased a 1996 Toyota Camry LE and have loved every minute I spend in the car.  It has power locks, power windows, A/C, sunroof, moon roof, and a extremely comfortable interior.  

The drive of the vehicle is smooth and the engine can rarely be heard!  A wonderful change from the last vehicle.  

I recommend this car for anyone that is looking for reliable yet stylish transportation.  I haven't had to take the car into the shop for anything but a regular oil and lube.  

Before I purchased the vehicle I spent several hours scouring through Consrumer Reports, the Blue Book, and other used car publications that rated the performance of used vehicles.  Time and time again, the reports were not only positive but rated the Camry as a best buy for the price and performance.  This car is going to last me a long time.<br><br>
