            How could I go from a luxury auto to a sporty convertible?  How was it a midlife crisis?  Not it was purchased on a hot summer day with visions of the wind in my hair, I must have forgotten weather does change.

My car is and was so very cute and wouldn't I be also.  Not quite.

When buying a car there are others to consider like my significant other who is almost 80 years old.  

First the seats are designed for 18 years olds (that is why my grandson borrows it for dates).  The curves on the sides are firm so if you want to slide out forget it.

What if I need to start transporting a wheel chair?  Forget it the trunk and back seat just won't do.  Maybe the trunk should have instructions to advise no more than 5 bags of groceries.

If you want fuel economy then this is your car.  It is reliable.

Cruising down the road is nice but convertible tops do flap in the wind
