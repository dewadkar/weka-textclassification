            I purchased my new 2000 X-terra SE about 9 months ago and I love it.  I am an avid fisherman and it handles very well off-road as well as on the highway.  It does consume quite a bit of gas, but is equal to other SUV's.  I love the look and style of it.  If you are looking for a dependable, sharp looking SUV that won't break your piggy bank, then the X-terra is for you.  I have not had any problems with it as of yet and I don't intend to.  Regular maintenance is a must.  The only thing that does bother me about the vehicle is the stereo.  It comes standard with a 6 speaker, 100watt CD, cassette stereo, but I am not that impressed with its power.  I am very accustomed to BOSE in my cars and this does not live up to that.  It's not bad though, it's just not BOSE.  Anyway, I am very pleased with it and plan to keep it for a long time.<br><br>
