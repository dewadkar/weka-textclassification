                 Think about this question.  What is your favorite car?  Do you like sports cars?  Luxury cars?  SUV�s?
     My favorite car is the Lamborghini.  I said my favorite car is a Lamborghini.  My favorite truck is the AM General HUMMER.  But let�s get back to the main story.  Just by looking at it, you can tell what it is.  The holes in the back and on the sides are air pockets that let the air get through.  These let the Lamborghinis have better aerodynamics and faster speeds by reducing the wind resistance.  The front end is also slanted down to cut through the air.
     The interior is loaded with goodies.  They have air conditioning, am/fm, cd/cassette, heated seats, sunroof/moon roof, leather seats, heated windshield, and many other extras.  The Lamborghinis have a little headroom, but not all that much.  If you are too tall for a Lamborghini, some dealers have a thing that they call �The Tall Mans Conversion�.  My friend is pretty short, so he didn't need it.  They raise the roof so you can fit in it.  The windshield and other windows make it hard to see out of, due to the body shape and style, but there�s really nothing you can do about that.
     The ride is fast with 350-530 horsepower that can take you to top speeds of 187-209 mph.  The Lamborghini Diablo can go 0-30 in 1.8 seconds, 0-60 in 3.8 seconds, and 0-100 in 8.0 seconds.  The ride isn�t all that smooth at all at least when I drove it it wasn't.  The seats are comfortable and the accessibility to all the functions is pretty easy also (a/c etc.) from the driver seat.
     The Lamborghinis are expensive, as you would expect.  They�re anywhere from $250,000-$350,000 base price.  That�s alot of money, but some lucky people can afford two or three.  Myself, I can't afford one, but my friend let me test drive his, and I fell in love with it.
     The Lamborghini comes in many models including the Diablo, Diablo GT, Diablo VT, Diablo SV, Diablo VT Alpine Edition, Diablo Roadster, Diablo SV Monterey, Countach, and many more.
     If you own one of these, you should be proud.  They are ranked up there as one of the greatest cars ever built.  As you�re driving down the road, you�ll see almost everybody in the other lanes trying to see who�s driving the car.  Is it a movie star, sports star, or rapper?  My friend told me that when he was driving one time, there was almost a wreck because the person driving beside him was too worried about the Lamborghini than the road in front of him.  
     The cars are great, but expensive.  With alot to offer, it�s one of the best.  If you like speed, attention, and have alot of money to blow away, then you should consider getting one.  That�s only if you like these awesome and totally remarkable cars.<br><br>
