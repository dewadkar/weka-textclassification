            While working for the local rental car agency I rented out Concordes.  What I have seen while working there is that they seemed to be quite dependable despite being made by Crysler.  These cars have been good for the two years that I worked there both the 99 and 2000 models held up nicely.  With over 25 different cars most worked smoothly with only routine maintenance.  With a huge trunk this car is ideal for a family that doesn't want that mini-van cramping their style.  Test drive one and find out how nice it is.  I do suggest getting the CD player.<br><br>
