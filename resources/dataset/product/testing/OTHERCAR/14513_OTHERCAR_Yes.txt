            My wife and I bought our '96 RAV4 4D automatic used in early '97. RAV4 was the only sub-$20k car both my wife (5'5") and I (6'2") could sit in and drive without spending three minutes adjusting the seat and the mirrors. We live in the boonies but commute to the city every day, so 4WD was a factor as well. Currently, our RAV4 has 95k miles on it.
Interior:
The RAV4 is classified a truck, and it feels like it, too. Sound insulation is poor. Tire and wind noise are loud and get progressively worse with age. The front seats are functional and the fabric resists wear well, but there's not quite enough leg room for someone over 6' tall. We like the fact that the back seat folds down with minimum hassle, but you have to remove the head rests.
Handling and performance:
The RAV4 is, in my opinion, grossly underpowered. The engine sounds rough especially in higher RPMs. It's hard to maintain a steady 70 mph speed on the interstate, especially when it's windy. The acceleration is poor, but once you get going, the RAV4 handles more like a car than a SUV. The brakes are excellent. In city, the car is fun to drive, it handles well, although the turning radius is ridiculously large for a car this size. Because of the four wheel drive, instead of over- or understeering, the RAV4 tends to "slide sideways" fairly easily when cornering, which can take one by surprise. Visibility is excellent to all directions. The RAV4 runs on great on regular (87 octane) gas. I get decent gas mileage, about 28 mpg which, surprisingly, doesn't vary that much between city and highway).
Reliability:
The car came with Toyota extended manufacturer 3 year/100k miles power train warranty. We purchased the additional extended bumper-to-bumper warranty, which proved to be utter waste of money -- not only because Toyota is so reliable, but because the dealership has tried everything they could to not honor the warranty. We've had a number of small problems, but basically, the extended warranty is worth anything only if the car self-destructs. Overall, the RAV4 has so far been extremely reliable, but scheduled maintenance costs at the dealership have been obscenely high. If you're considering a RAV4 (or any Toyota for that matter), check out the reputation and price level of your local dealership.
Quality:
Typical Japanese quality. All parts fit, no major squeaks or squeals, but the dashboard and assorted plastic mouldings begin to rattle with age. In our RAV4, front door power window motors stopped closing the window properly around 80k miles and the windows started to leak. The vinyl/plastic/whatever cladding is a pain to keep clean.
Overall:
Don't expect any thrills with RAV4, it's got a high initial cool factor, but once the novelty wears off, you'll realize it's still a glorified pickup truck. It's reliable, but even scheduled maintenance at a dealership can really hurt your wallet.
UPDATE 01/2001:
Our RAV4 has now 110,000 miles on it, it's been paid off and it's still going strong! Interior noise is getting worse by the day, but I can live with that. Btw. the 1996 RAV4 was the 1st in reliability in JD Power & Assoc. used car survey...
UPDATE 10/2001:
Hit 120,000 miles, starting to eat up a little oil (about a quart/3000 miles). Other than that, nothing major. I changed the standard Bridgestone tires to Dunlops, and the interior noise went way down, and gas mileage went up to 35 mpg!
UPDATE 5/2002:
130,000 miles and still going strong. Original brake pads are finally dead, but other than that, nothing but oil changes to keep the RAV going.
UPDATE 9/2002:
Just hit 140,000 miles. The RAV developed a tendency to stall every now and then on idle when the engine got hot,  switched to Castrol High Mileage oil and that got rid of both the stalling problem and excess oil consumption.
UPDATE 3/2003:
The RAV started developing small but annoying problems: stalling on idle, emergency brake light coming on at random, fan rattling, so it came time to part ways with it at 148,000 miles.
