            My company evaluated half a dozen different digital cameras to determine the best overall product to incorporate into our id badging packages.  The Sony proved to be the simplest to operate, no matter what the user's skill level was.  It has an excellent range of features, was intuitive to use, compact, medium weight, and the choice of a 3.5&quot; floppy as the transfer method ensures that most of the customer base is already equipped to download images.  Also, the variety of file formats available to save images reinforces the camera's utility.

The bundled software is perhaps too limited in scope, especially compared to the broad market design thinking behind the camera's engineering.  Plus, of the near dozen cameras I've provided to customers, two had a defective pixel in the built-in display.  The images themselves are crystalline in their purity, so it's a relatively minor complaint, but a valid one nonetheless.  

Overall, the camera is worth every penny, and promises to give full value over it's lifetime.  The Sony name is nearly always an indicator of quality, and Sony upholds the grand tradition yet again.<br><br>
