            We bought a 1990 Saab 900 Convertible about 4 years ago.  When we bought it there were 100,000 miles on it and it was flawless.  Over the past 4 years we have enjoyed this car so much.  Mechanically speaking it is a great car.  Although expect to pay out some money when it does break, however those occasions have been few and far between.  Things to look for are transmission troubles in automatics, and make sure to check out the top and see if it is in good condition.  These are fairly inexpensive to replace, with a good aftermarket costing around 500-600 $.  Also I would highly recommend taking this car to a certified Saab mechanic before purchasing, just to look it over and make sure everything is on par!  Make sure he or she checks the Turbo.  This is a costly item to replace.
These cars will keep going and going, as long as preventitive maintainence is performed, and the car is taken well care of.  I highly recommend it.  Have Fun!<br><br>
