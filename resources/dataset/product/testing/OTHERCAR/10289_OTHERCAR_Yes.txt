            OK, I was tired of driving my mother-in-laws car!  That's why I did it.  I was engaged to be married and had no way to take her shopping.  That's important you know!

Looking for cars is not easy, and I did lots of it.  Heck, I wasn't even looking for a new car.  All I wanted was a reasonably priced, economical car, and not a &quot;grandma car&quot;.  (Done that...) A brand new Nissan Sentra was the perfect choice.

It came with all the essentials, air, electric windows and doors, caset player and rear window defroster.  And the color was perfect.  The price was very reasonable.  Don't forget the new car smell...

This would not be a good review if I didn't tell you all the facts, though.  The first year I owned it the shifter locked up.  I think that it might have been partially my fault.  Some kind of liquid spilled near that location.  The car was fixed by a repair shop in one day.  (Must have been an easy fix.)

The only other problem I have had with my Nissan is that the brakes seem to need replacing a little more than previous cars I've owned.  No big problem to me though. I've got a lifetime warranty on them.

Over all I have to say it is the best car that I have ever owned.<br><br>
