            I shopped Honda (overpriced), Toyota (tall Corolla's are NOT style), Ford Focus (Close second but Dodge had the best seats and safety and a best ride). Saw the car at 6 PM on a Friday at a CarMax dealer and by 7 PM I drove home. The car drove right..power to pass...quiet...side airbags, A/C, 2.0 liter 16 valve, CD/tape/6 speakers, GREAT seats and loads of detail in very hi quality materials (MUCH nicer upholstery than the japanese cars!). The car has a 7 year/70000 mile warranty, and free oil changes every fifth one.
Silver paint and charcoal interior added a bit more style...almost classy look to an other wise smart looking design. Trunk is huge and access is easy and has drop split rear seats for the skis and occasional 2x4. And the $15,800 sticker was discounted to $10,200! DONE DEAL! Look for a 2002 NOW as the 2003's hit the streets. 30% off. It was the deal maker...and it doesn't look like the boring competition.
