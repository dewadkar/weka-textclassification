            I was a big fan of SLR cameras in the past.  I've used a Minolta 700 for about the past 10 years.  I started having problems with it and decided to shop around for a digital camera.  I researched a number of different models, first on the internet and then at various electronics stores.  Finally, I settled on the Sony DSC-S50.  I was already comfortable with Sony products because I owned a Sony Hi 8 camcorder.

The first thing about the Sony DSC-S50 was something I've found all Sony products have in common:  You don't need to read the manual to use the device.  The controls are laid out well and the menus are very intuitive.  Once you charge the battery, you can take off and start shooting.  The battery life is also pretty good considering you can only use a display to frame your picture.  You start out with over 3 hours of life and work from there.  I've learned several tricks to conserve battery life.  First, turn off your camera in-between pictures.  You know - if you're waiting a few minutes or more.  Second, if you're going to review the pictures stored on your memory card, if you can, use the a/v cables that come with the camera and plug it into the TV or VCR.  That way, you can leave the screen closed.  It's the main energy drain.

As far as shooting goes, I've found that the camera does have about 1/2 second delay before the shutter goes.  You just have to adjust to &quot;leading&quot; your subjects and anticipating them.  Also, while you're framing your picture, if you bring your subject close, you have to hold your breath while snapping the photo or you might cut off the top of the image.  It would have also been nice if Sony had been a little less miserly with the memory card that shipped with the camera.  All we get is a 4 MB stick.  I greatly recommend going out to buy a 32 or 64 MB stick.  You'll love the difference...especially if you use the video feature.  With a 32 MB stick, you can take a video - with sound - that's a few minutes long.  When you load the software to transfer the software to your computer, the USB transfer is very fast.  It would have been better though, if you could specify your own directories for download.

There are a few more features I recommend for your camera.  One is relatively cheap but very important.  You need to get an ultraviolet filter for your camera lens.  It only runs about $8 and you'll cry a lot less if you scratch the filter than if you scratch the lens.  I also recommend you get a camera case for the camera, an extra memory stick and maybe a usb cable.  I looked around 4 or 5 different stores and the best case I saw was the Ambico camera case (the model about the same size as the Cybershot.)  It fits the camera perfectly (if you put in in sideways) and has an extra pocket for a few extras.  It comes with a shoulder strap and a belt strap that loops under your belt and snaps in place.  I tested it out before buying it and the case is very hard to pull off your belt (e.g. - someone trying a snatch and grab.)

The only thing I have against the camera is that it can't be used for any telephoto work.  But I knew that going in.  Really, it's a very good all-around value.<br><br>
