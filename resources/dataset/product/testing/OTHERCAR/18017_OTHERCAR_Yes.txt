            I purchased this camera December 31st 1998.  I will NEVER use print film again!

I have always enjoyed toying with photography and developing my own photos.  It is an expensive hobby; not to mention the danger using some of the chemicals involved.  I always saw digital imagery as one day being the way I would love to go, but I was never satisfied with the digital images of the first consumer Digital�s on the market.  

I wanted something with a megapixel resolution, somewhat allow manipulation of the exposure while taking the image, as well as the ability to use an external �slave� flash.  When this camera came along, and after some extensive research, I jumped.

You can take many exposures without having to change the batteries. (considering all the electronics in this thing, and use re-chargeable Nicads)  On average I could shoot about 60 images before I need to swap out drained batteries.  I have two sets of four, so at one setting, I can take about 120 shots without recharging!  These same four batteries are still going strong after using them for over a year and a half.  I liked the feel, and look of the 620l as opposed to some of the other models out too.  It felt more like a SLR than most of the others.  However, if you have a LARGE or LONG NOSE (as I do) you will find yourself leaving a NOSE PRINT on the LCD after shooting.  You also have to be careful with the Smart Media Card as it can break.  (This has NOT happened to me)

A number of Digital�s that have come out, actually a blizzard.  Some are around the same price as the 620l, but now have the ability to go fully manual.  I do not regret my decision to purchase this fine camera.  The flaw I see in many of the cameras out today is that they allow bits of video and sound to be recorded.  I did not want that.

I that the price of the Olympus 620L has remained in the $800 to $900!  

Eventually I�ll purchase another digital, but not until some of those SLR Digital�s, with interchangeable lens� go below $1000.  They are now around $5000.  My guess is in about 3 to 5 years print film will not be as popular in the consumer market as Digital�s will be.  

I have shot some 600 to 700 digital photographs (think of the cost of purchasing the film &amp; printing costs that were saved).  I also have printed ONLY images that I liked.  They rival any 35mm photo that I have seen printed up to 8x10�.   Once you do decide to go digital, you will have to decide how to store images safely (CD ROM burner) and how to print them.  But overall, I could not be happier going digital.  And the Olympus 620L suits me just fine 

 I�ll follow up with commentary on the hardware I purchased.
