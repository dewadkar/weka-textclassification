            I bought my 92 SL1 from the original owner earlier this year.  He took a lot of trips to Tennessee football games during his ownership of the car totaling some 140,600 miles in 6 years.  

Prior to buying the car I arrived on my first visit to the Saturn dealership with some skepticism - could they really be a &quot;different kind of car company&quot; and still be owned by GM?  I was wondering where all the jelly doughnuts were too - that guy from the commercial had surely been making the rounds on this day - none to be found.  What I did find was a friendly service manager (a bit oxymoronic) inviting me to the shop floor where the Saturn I was about to buy from the UT fanatic was being probed and scanned and evaluated by NASA engineers (or so it seemed).  I mean, these guys knew this car inside and out.  As it turns out, the mechanic...ahem..., I mean ASE certified technician had given the little gray four-door the benefit of a complete work over from bumper-to-bumper including calling up a detailed repair history from the Saturn database.  After spending an hour with me explaining the features and condition of the car, they walked me back through the shop about half an hour after closing time and when I reached for the VISA they exclaimed - &quot;Oh, we don't charge you for just checking out the car.&quot; &quot;Uh...OK!&quot; I said.

The only problem I have had was with the wiper stalks months later (it turned out that they only needed to be cleaned).  I finally admitted defeat to diagnosing the problem myself in the effort to be cheap.  When I took it into the dealer to see why the wipers were giving me trouble, the PARTS counter guy came out in the pouring rain, fixed the problem without me having to purchase anything and joyfully waved goodbye as I pulled off the lot with mouth agape and shaking my head in sheer disbelief at the Saturn commitment to customer satisfaction I had once again witnessed.  Frankly, many companies have apparently deleted the term from their corporate speak altogether

After 9 months of ownership and another 14,000 miles on the old odometer, I am happy to report $0 spent on repairs, and about $70 on a couple of winter wiper blades, two oil changes and a tune-up which I did myself (they've made it really easy to do your own maintenance if you're into that sort of thing).  This is a great car with an excellent reputation, incredible durability (I've got 156,000 miles on the original clutch!!!), ultra cheap to maintain, and an incomparable service program.   <br><br>
