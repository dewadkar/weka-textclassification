            I purchased a 1993 Z34 new back in October of 1992 and owned it until November of 1999. Needless to say I got to know this vehicle very well. The first couple of years this was truly a wonderful car. Power, gas mileage, good ride, it had it all. 

Then the reality of having a large engine crammed into this vehicle took hold. The first of TWO alternators quit, it is located under the engine and most places won't even work on this engine, needless to say expensive repair, mostly labor. The engine also developed a oil leak. It was found to be seeping from the back side head gasket. The dealer said it would never get worse and that the repair would probably make more trouble. They were right, the oil leak never get worse.

Since I know the service manager at the Chevy dealer quite well, they were starting to warn me about a much more serious repair that the 3.4 dual twin cam engine has, in fact everywhere I went mechanics were warning me about this problem. The problem is that the timing belt breaks at aprox 100,000 miles. A very expensive repair since engine damage can occur.

When I got rid of this vehicle it had less than 80,000 miles and I did not have to change the timing belt, one mechanic said it was amazing how close to 100,000 miles each one of the failed belts that he had run into.

The other area that was costly but not for me since I always use the parking brake, was the rear disc brake repair cost. This affected all Lumina's not just the Z34. I believe there is a class action law suit against GM on this one.

I liked my Z34 but it was very expensive for the few repairs that I had. I was told by a very good source the the 3.4 Dual twin cam engine was very expensive to make, well whatever it has since disappeared from the GM engine stable.
