            Just so that you know where the review is coming from, I'm new to digital cameras and have the &quot;camera- and photography-consciousness&quot; of an average person.  My primary motivation for buying a digital camera was to get my feet wet with new technology, and be able to send pictures to family and friends via email without the hassle of developing, printing, and scanning.  Besides, with a digital camera, one never has to keep bad pictures... they can be simply deleted, and they cost nothing!

I paid $499 for my camera (DC 240i blueberry) at CompUSA in 02/2000.  It was available for a little less on the web (around $450), but I didn't want to wait, and plus I prefer to buy expensive stuff in a store because if it has problems, returning it is easy.  The price for it was the same as for the DC 240, but the DC 240i just looked a lot better.  

Overall, I have liked the camera.  It was very easy to use.  I was able to take pictures and download them using the software within minutes after opening the box!  However, if you don't have a USB port on the computer, it might take a while.  I've never been able to get the transfer mechanism working through the COM ports.  Here's what I like and dislike about the camera.

Like:
- Color
- Light weight
- Day time pictures are beautiful
- Pictures in the dark are great with the flash
- Picture detail is excellent
- I didn't have to buy a single additional thing to get this camera working (it came with rechargeable batteries, cable, software... everything that you'll ever need for using the camera)
- Ease of use
- Tons of features like flash modes, borders for pictures, date stamps, etc.

Dislike:
- Low battery life.  It's very easy to drain a set of fully charged batteries if you use the LCD display and review feature a lot (or even the flash for that matter).  I've had days when the fully recharged battery drain after about 15 shots.
- Pictures in the dark with not so powerful batteries makes for bad pictures because the flash doesn't work too well, even though the flash flashes.
- Pictures in the dark without a flash are very poor
- Size is a little big

All in all, it's a great camera, but if you're a value shopper, you might be disappointed because the technology is changing rapidly and I would expect cameras with much better battery life to appear shortly obsoleting this particular model.  It would also be nice if Kodak would make it possible to recharge the batteries while they are in the camera.  Lugging around a host of cables and batteries on a vacation is not something I'd be looking to do :-)

When I bought the digital camera, I was expecting it to be a replacement for my existing 35 mm camera.  I guess I was completely off there.  After doing some post-purchase research, I realize that we are still far away from the day when 35 mm cameras will become obsolete, and that this expectation of mine was actually unrealistic.  

This is a fun camera and I would recommend it because it's been a great digital camera for me.  Just don't expect it to be the only camera you'll ever need, because when it comes to things like portability, the cost of getting printed pictures, and battery life, nothing beats a 35 mm camera... at least not yet!!

Just wanted to add an update... I read somewhere that you can buy lithium batteries that will work well with the DC 240.  Apparently, someone said they lasted about 300 shots.  The down side is the cost.  They cost as much as the rechargeable NiMH batteries, but only they are non-rechargeable.  So it's useful if you need to take the camera on a vacation and don't want to lug the recharging equipment with you.  I haven't tried it yet, but I'm excited that there's a way around the poor battery power.
