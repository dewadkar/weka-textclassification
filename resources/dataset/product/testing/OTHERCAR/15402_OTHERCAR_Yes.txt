            I bought myself the Sony MVC FD-83 digital camera for Christmas.  I had looked around at other cameras with smaller price tags but the Sony won out.  I love being able to take a few disks along to a party and snap away.  In daylight or in darkness, this camera can auto focus and I can minimize the subject area to make the picture I really want even sharper.  The battery lasts for a couple of hours, and a timer tells you how much battery time you have left. I would highly recommend the Sony MVC FD-83 to anyone who is looking for a worry free digital camera.

Just for price comparison information, I bought my camera from a Sony dealer in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and it cost me approximately $775 once I converted the local currency into US dollars.<br><br>
