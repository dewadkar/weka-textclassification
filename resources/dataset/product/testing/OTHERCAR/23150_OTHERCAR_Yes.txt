            I picked up the Canon IXUS V3 to replace our wonderful IXUS V.  We were very happy with its predecessor, but it met an unfortunate end when the motor suffered damage while shooting in subzero temperatures in Romania.

As with the V, the V3 is superbly made.  The engineers at Canon managed to smooth out some of the bumps and it appears to be slightly smaller than the V.  The case is still metal, which does a good job of protecting the V3 from bumps and minor mishaps.  

The controls have changed slightly, offering easier access to some settings such as flash, mode, etc.  Canon has also added some features, such as white balance, b/w, sepia and colour enhanced shooting modes.  You can also adjust things like ISO when in manual shooting mode.

The increased resolution really makes a difference.  I find the images produced with the V3 to be of high quality overall.  Granted, a lot of it depends on the photographer, but I have got some excellent results using the V3 with very little effort on my part.  

I bought this camera for snapshots and spur-of-the-moment shots, and in this it excels.  It is small enough to carry around without being a problem.  As a matter of fact, I carry it in a small, leather cigarette case!  For the most part, I leave it on auto and adjust the flash accordingly.  However, when used with a tripod in manual mode I have been able to get some really good shots in low light situations.  The tripod also helps out when shooting in panoramic mode.  

The movie mode has also been enhanced.  You can now shoot up to 3 minutes, with sound.  This is great for me, as I detest lugging around a video camera just for a few minutes of footage.  

It appears that the lens motor has been tweaked to make it faster - at least I think so.  The 2x optical zoom is a bit limiting, I would have preferred more but it is better than nothing.  Digital zoom is the same as before - dodgy - but that is as expected.  I do not use it unless absolutely necessary.  

The LCD on the back of the unit is bright and easy to use.  Battery life has been extended, so now I do not have to worry about using the LCD as my viewfinder.  

The software that comes with the IXUS V3 is easy to install and use, but I really cannot comment on it as I only use it to download the images to the HDD and to stitch together panoramic images.  The latter come out well enough, but you might want to consider touching them up in Photoshop.  

There are also a plethora of other features which I do not use, including remote capture and operation (via laptop), line out to a TV or projector, etc.  I am sure they are useful but I do not have any need for them at the moment.

I find the Canon IXUS V3 to be a worthy successor to the IXUS V.  The combination of image quality, features, construction and small size at a great price make it a recommended buy.
