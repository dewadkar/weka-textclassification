            We just bought a c240 this weekend.  We looked at most entry-level luxury cars (BMW, Volvo, Audi, Cadillac, Lexus).  We quickly narrowed the list to the BMW 330 and Mercedes C240.  The BMW is definitely more sporty, faster, and handles better.  The Mercedes is a little more roomier, feels more like a luxury car (not sports car), and has better safety features (8 air bags, an SOS button).

The Mercedes also offered an extra year of free service on the warranty (4 years instead of BMWs 3 years).

So far, we love the car.  For a Mercedes, it offers a good value.  We looked at many non-luxury cars (Nissan, Mazda, Toyota, etc.) and for the extra few thousand dollars, you get a better built car and a better warranty that includes free service for the first 4 years.  It also offers free loaners (very nice), free car washes, and roadside service.

We did purchase the extended warranty that extends the warranty to eight years or 100k miles.  We plan on keeping car at least 8 year.  I think it is pricey ($2500); however, for the next 8 years, I don't need to worry about a costly repair.  All luxury cars are expensive to fix, so it is kind of like insurance.

Some of the car reviews that I have read complain about the Mercedes buttons.  They do seem complicated; however, the dealership spent over an hour going over every detail of the car before we took delivery.  So, we understood how everything worked before we drove off the lot.

I own a Lexus LS400 and I have to admit that the Mercedes Dealership was more friendly and helpful when we bought their car.  I love the Lexus LS400; however, they are too expensive and I am not trilled about the Lexus entry level cars.

Don't expect too much room on price negotiations.  We checked with three different dealerships and there is not much room.  I got an option thrown it . . .that is about it.

Best of luck.
