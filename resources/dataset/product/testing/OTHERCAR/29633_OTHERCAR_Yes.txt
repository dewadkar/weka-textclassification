            Interested in some serious digital photography? Willing to spend stratospheric amounts to get the very best of SLR capabilities in a digital environment? Want over 3 megapixels to boot? Want the quality and assurance of the Canon EOS name?

Then open up your check book, starting writing a whole lot of zeroes and say hello to the <b>Canon EOS D30 Digital SLR Camera</b>.  With the <b>EOS D30</b>, you'll not only get the best of both SLR and Digital environments, you'll get it in a package that was built from the ground up to be the very best digital SLR available - anywhere.  Instead of just slapping on digital technology on top of an existing SLR body, Canon created the <b>EOS D30</b> the right way.  Adding the latest technological and photographic elements to create a sure-fire hit.  But it is at a price - $2000 for the body alone.

The <b>EOS D30</b> offers an incredible high-quality image. Canon's new large-area imaging element, the CMOS sensor is the driver behind the resolution. It allows you to get a better picture with more definition, 3.11 million pixels to be exact. Canon also established a 2:3 aspect ratio just like the pros use. The result? More professional pictures even if you're not a professional.

The key to the SLR is lens compatibility & accessories. The <b>EOS D30</b> uses all EF lenses without restrictions or limitations. According to Canon, that's over forty current lenses and nearly 100 since the series began in 1987.

And because this is an EOS camera, you can use many EOS series attachments such as EX-Series Speedlites and N3-series remote control accessories without modification to enhance its performance. 

The built-in flash system featuring high precision E-TTL Retractable Autoflash, is linked to focusing points, so your subject will always get the correct exposure even when it's off-center. 

The <b>EOS D30</b> supports USB and NTSC/PAL Video Out for instant access to your digital images.  The NTSC/PAL Video Out option allows you to view your images on a TV and other audio/visual devices.

The <b>EOS D30</b> provides 5 data recording formats, allowing you the flexibility of assigning increased (or decreased) resolution per picture. 

The continuous shooting feature allows you to always be ready for the next shot, even when the action gets fast and furious. The <b>EOS D30</b> supports continuous shooting up to 8 consecutive frames in Large/Fine mode at a rate of approximately 3 frames per second. If you switch to Large/Normal mode or one of the Small resolution settings to more than double the maximum number of consecutive frames.

The list of features and abilities of this camera go on and on.  Clearly, for the price, you get a tremendous amount of digital power all coupled in your awaiting hands.  If you have the means, and you're ready to get serious about digital photography, then the Canon <b>EOS D30</b> is likely the camera for you.
