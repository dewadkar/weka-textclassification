            I had the pleasure of recently renting a 2000 Base Intrepid for my vacation. I drove it for 5 days and 1500 KM (900 Miles).

To make sure that the readers understand where I am coming from... I am a 5 year Honda Accord owner and even though I have had my share of trouble with the old girl (1989 with over 300000 kms), I am still very pleased to get behind the wheel.

Handling:

1989 Accord. Crisp, responsive and accurate. I can do a u-turn on a dime. Rough ride, but you have to sacrifice a little when you want the handling. I especially love the variable assist power steering (standard since 87)

2000 Intrepid. Decent, average and under-confident. There is one thing that Chrysler knows how to do very well and that is to over-assist the steering. I felt as if I was on ice every time I turned the wheel. I know that the R/T should fill in for this problem, but were talking about an 11-year difference. My accord? A technology leader 11 years ahead of its time?!?!?!?! Nope just typical Chrysler steering. I must say that the ride was nice and smooth. The biggest contributor being the long wheelbase.


Power:

Intrepid = V6. Accord = 4 banger....

Need I say more? (I have driven the V6 Accord and I will say that the Intrepid seems more responsive on the pedal)


Entry:

You may ask: Why is he bringing up such a topic?

I say: If the car is as big as it is, why the he** was I forever hitting my head on the doorframe!!!!!!!!!?????????!!!!!!!!!

I don't have that problem with ANY of the accords. (The only one I have not driven is the 84-86)

To all drivers from 5'11&quot; and up. Beware the Ides of an Intrepid Head eater!!!!!!


Long drive comfort:

I found that the Intrepid had an excessive amount of wind noise for such an aerodynamic looking car. That coupled with the fact that the seats did not have any real lumbar support made for a shifty 6-hour drive.

The Accord on the other hand with its 11-year-old seats is always inviting. I have driven for 6 hours straight in it and loved the whole ride. I would say that the wind noise at the same speeds as in the Intrepid produce only a bit more noise. (It doesn't help that I mashed one of the window seals on my Accord though)


Overall:

I could go on for hours.... But.

Here is my one liner:

The Accord was and is the perfect marriage of sport and sedan. The intrepid is the perfect spouse to an old person.

I have yet to test the R/T so I will not get to demeaning yet....
