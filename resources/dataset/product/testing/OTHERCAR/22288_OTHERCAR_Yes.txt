            I purchased the 2000 MPV Model LX with Sport Package Option in June this year. Having researched the vehicle thoroughly against Toyota Sienna LE, Honda Odyssey and Dodge Caravan (Long Base, upscale model), I feel confident we made a well-informed choice. We read pages of web comments on all vehicles and test drove them all as well.

We chose the Mazda for price, ergonomics and handling. We have a family of 4 (with a fifth on the way) no pets, no heavy towing needs and no need to load up with drywall sheets (crazy comment but crucial if you are a do-it-yourselfer, expecting to pack a construction site in your van.)

We are simply delighted and would recommend the vehicle to anyone of similar driving needs. 

This van corners and brakes amazingly. It lacks the off-the-line power and torque of the Honda and Toyota, but you don't get the bus-like characteristics in corners, that those vehicles definitely display. The sport package includes alloy wheels and I am a big believer in reducing unsprung weight for enhanced handling. One glitch I expected (having read it in a review) was poor low-speed shifting whereby the automatic transmission would be &quot;undecided&quot; and up-shift/down-shift frequently as though it can't make its mind up. This irritated the auto-mag reviewer. I personally found the solution to be laughably easy: simply thumb the overdrive setting &quot;off&quot; in city conditions. And truly, it is only the &quot;red light after red light&quot; type of driving that warrants it. 

The seat arrangements and re-arrangement ergonomics are the best in the class. My wife is a spend-a-holic for other people's junk, and I usually get the &quot;honey-do&quot; requests to deliver the loads. I have popped out both rear seats in under 5 minutes and loaded a 6-piece maple dining room suite in this van. The combinations of seating and the ease of doing so makes the Dodge and Ford designs look Cromagnon by comparison. On the Caravan, even simply folding the rear seat up and down takes either Arnold Schwarzenegger or two smaller people. The Mazda is ultimately people-friendly.

Value for the options was reasonable. I negotiated the sport package (normally $1,800 Canadian) to cost and saved hundreds. It didn't take hardball with the dealer either. The 6-CD changer, 9-speaker, 192-watt stereo with subwoofer is nice, but under-powered as they rate RMS power TOTAL instead of per-channel or per-speaker. For the lower price I paid, fine, but at list I'd call it poor value.

After sales service and glitches have been OK for a new model year. But I experienced some issues. The steering wheel quivered a bit at speed like the tire balance was off. It turned out to be defective front brake rotors -- replaced cheerfully under warranty. So far that's it, other than a pesky sunglasses holder on the roof console that has a cheap design and breaks regularly. (The demo vehicle at 2 dealers had this thing broken in the showroom units!) Last minor irritant: the speed of the power windows is a little laconic. 

Even with the minor problems, I'd buy this vehicle again and unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone who doesn't pull motor homes or run a contracting business on the side. <br><br>
