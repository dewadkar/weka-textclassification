            I bought this camera before the 990 came out and because the 900 was too expensive for me.  Now both the 900 and the 800 are much cheaper.  But overall I like my 800 the best.  

It does remind me of a Volvo in the sense that it looks boxy, but it's just really good and solid.  It's definitely not fancy looking, but does take fantastic pictures.  Sometimes, however the pics come out a bit dark. The flash can definitely be improved.

Battery life with regular batteries is horrendous.  You definitely need to get rechargeables.  Also, you need to upgrade the 8mb flash to at least 32mb or 64mb.

The biggest problem with this camera is that there really is no &quot;click&quot; sound at time of picture.  It's fine if you know how to use this camera, but if you have friends or strangers take group pics for you, it's very hard for them to use it because of this.  Therefore, those pics don't come out too great.

It is a bit bulky to carry around, but overall great for the price.<br><br>
