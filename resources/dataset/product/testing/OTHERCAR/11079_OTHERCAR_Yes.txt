            I'll be the first to admit that styling is subjective, but about once a decade, some automaker uncorks a visual bolt of lightning that resets everyone's standards for design. The Audi TT is this year's lightning bolt, in two ways. Not only does its bulbous sheetmetal evoke the prewar Auto Union racers and early bathtub Porsches whose designers are intertwined with Audi's history, but the TT provides revolutionary relief from the permutations of pebbled polymer and wearisome wood-grain that have been the tired interior standards for decades.
From its glittering polished-aluminum bits to the functional knee pads fitted onto the aluminum console braces to the stunningly detailed telescoping seat-heater controls, every millimeter of the TT interior has been advanced by bold and tasteful designers.
The TT doesn't get by on its looks alone, however. Its 180-hp turbocharged engine produces strong urge at any rpm. Its Volkswagen Golf-based chassis is responsive and comfortable, in either front- or four-wheel drive. And its hatchback layout includes a kiddy-sized rear seat or room for plenty of luggage when folded down. <br><br>
