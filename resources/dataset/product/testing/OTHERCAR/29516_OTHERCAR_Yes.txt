            This is an excellent camera.  Although CNet rates this camera much lower than the DC280 I believe the DC240 is a better camera.  Kodak has improved on the DC240 with firmware upgrades (version 1.08 is now shipping with new units).  The new software has solve some of the problems that early users were complaining about (outdoor pictures).

I tested both the DC240 and DC280.  Although the DC280 has much better resolution, the DC240 pictures were actually sharper (and had better color rendering).  This might be due to the fact that the DC240 has better response to low light conditions (I take more indoor pictures than outdoor).  Also, the DC280 pictures often seem to be too red.  Under &quot;ideal conditions&quot; the DC280 had great results but this was not consistent.

In addition, I compared the DC240 to the Epson 850 (2.1 MPixel unit).  The Epson pictures were very sharp but the color tended to lean toward the yellow green.  

The DC240's pictures consistently had excellent color and the sharpness was also very good.  The controls are easy, the response is very fast, and the optics are top rate (3X and very clear).  This camera is a very good value and I highly recommend it.
