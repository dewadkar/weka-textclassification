              Ours is fully loaded: 
 I never liked the looks of SAAB, well until they went to this newer body style. Now that they are owned by GM, keep an eye open for new models and many good things ahead. This is our first SAAB. Seriously, this is one of the LAST cars I would have considered buying, now that we own one, I LOVE it!. We drove the BMW 5 series, Toyota Avalon, Chevy Impala. All good vehicles in their own way. 
 BMW, too much money for what you get
 Toyota Avalon, Great car, we just had a Jerk for a sales person
 Chevy Impala, considerably less money, but no creature comforts (even if fully loaded)
 SAAB, we got a Fully loaded SAAB 9-5 for about the same price as the Toyota Avalon (maybe a little more?)

 SAAB's 4 year (or is it 5?) Bumper - Bumper is great, Free service (for the 'bigger' service visits), oil changes are buyers responsibility, Our dealer (in this area) is unbelivable, if every dealer was like them, buying a car and having it maintained would be a pleasure, VERY RARE these days. 
 Interior - Even the Glove box has an extra function (move a slider and it will keep you food and drinks cold via. the air conditioning), Not much plastic cheap stuff, so it feels / looks sturdy. The Audio system is decent (not the best, but certainly better than some). Seats are comfortable and adjust in every way imaginable. It takes a while to get used to the key being in the center (between the driver and passenger). There are so many neat features in the interior I won't list them all ... suffice it to say .... totally kewl!!! And things I would have never thought of / or expected.
Drive -The car is a pleasure to drive (even on the rough roads of upstate NY). It can pin you in the seat in Sport mode. I was never too thrilled about a 4-cyl engine, but after looking at these cars with 140,000, 180,000, 230,000 (one in the service dept. all for minor work), I realized these aren't the cheep aluminum blocked warp machines I've seen in other automobiles. These things are BUILT!!
 Exterior - OK, they aren't those ugly bubble, Egg, weird looking freak cars any longer. The 9-5 looks almost like a Nissan Maxima.  Wipers on the head lights, sun roof, Not the greatest selection of colors, Brake dust from front disks constantly (like BMW's). 
Overall - Great car!! Since my wife is the Primary driver of this car, I'll give it another year ... if I'm still this high on the car (which I probably will be ... since the first 5 months have been great), I think we'll buy another one (Maybe and Aero for me).
