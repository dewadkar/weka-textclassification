            Let me say this up front, I love my 2001 Volvo.  The first drive did it for me.  I had decided I needed a more �adult� car than my little red cop-magnet and what better way to go �adult/yuppie� than in a little black station wagon?  This Volvo-badged Mitsubishi is beautifully made, reasonably quick, has a remarkably capable optional sound system, and is built like a tank.  In the week since I took delivery, I have put 530 miles on it averaging 25.4 miles per gallon, covered the wheels in brake dust, washed it twice, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.
 
My dealer experience was very good  / excellent.  I opted for the Sunroof / Stereo / Leather / Wood / Power Seat packages which punched the price up to twenty-nine thousand, the invoice was about two thousand less than that, the dealer averaged the difference, gave me full book on my Porsche, had all the paperwork filled out in advance, and filled the tank with gas.  I was in, and out, in 30 minutes.
  
A couple of things worth noting about mine:  My V40 was delivered with a small hairline crack along the plastic handle above the rear hatch lock.  The dealer has assured me that this will be replaced under warranty.  Also, the 5 speed automatic transmission features a �driver adaptive� program which ostensibly figures out how the driver drives and adjusts its shifting pattern accordingly.  In practice, it works very well except when you let up off the gas downhill going into a turn.  The tranny shifts down to maintain engine braking and then picks with a slight shudder as the car exits the corner under hard acceleration.  It�s only a small annoyance now although I am not sure how the tranny will age.  I am over 6� and when I adjust the front seat to allow me the legroom I need, there is ZERO back seat legroom.  For my needs, this is not a problem, but it is worth considering for young families with growing legs.  And my final grip has to do with the keyless entry system:  The system requires a single click to unlock the drivers� door and a second click to unlock the remainder of the doors.   I must click wrong because it takes me a few tries to unlock all the doors.  In computer-land, we call that sort of thing �a feature, not a bug.�

As a whole I am very pleased with the car, I am thrilled with the dealer (Napa Volvo), and I would recommend the car whole-heartedly to any single twenty-something guy who needs to shuttle lots of stuff / dogs / shrubbery around and wants a wickedly quick, cheap (relatively), and sporty hot-hatch to do it in.  Oh, and the sunroof is wonderful.
