            After my boyfriend and I had thought about all our options on what digital camera to buy, we decided to purchase the Olympus D-600L.

The retail value of the camera when it first came out was about $1300, but currently it is $700 or less.

Luckily for my boyfriend and I, we were able to find a brand new one on ebay for a very cheap price - $361 shipping included...so we got a very great deal!

The price of the camera is alot cheaper than the Sony Mavica, and they pretty much have around the same megapixels.  They both are also pro SLR cameras with aspherical lenses.  So I think it's a great buy to purchase the Olympus since its about $400 cheaper than other digital cameras that provide about the same quality photos.

The Olympus D-600L has alot of easy to use features, and produces very high quality, accurate photos.

It works great with flash and natural light.

The only thing that I don't really like about the Olympus is the fact that it is sometimes hard to focus in low light.  And also that it didn't give too much instructions on how to put the shoulder strap on, which was kinda difficult.

Other than that, it's a great buy if your looking for a professional SLR Digital Camera within a price range that doesnt go beyond $700.

But make sure you have plenty of re-chargeable batteries handy...this camera eats up batteries!!! (But dont all digital cameras do that?)
