            I recently took a trip to San Francisco for a wedding and we rented a Kia Sedona to haul friends and family around the city for 3 days.  I was very impressed with this minivan.  We had the LX model (low-end) which comes with a long list of standard features.

<b>Ride:</b>
The ride is very smooth no matter which end you are sitting at.  The cabin is very quiet, there is minimal road and engine noise.  It handles bumps nicely I noticed, especially in San Francisco where the roads are no where near perfect.  It felt very stable and smooth, not jerky or wobbly.  

<b>Engine:</b>
The Sedona has a 3.5 V6 with 195 horsepower.  It has an automatic transmission and overdrive (manual is not an option).  It can tow up to 3,500 lbs., but only gets 15/20 MPG.  It comes in only front wheel drive.  It accelerates fast and still maintains a smooth ride well at high speeds.  I did not notice any vibrations or strange noises while we were going 85 MPH, it hardly felt like we were going that fast at all.  It comes standard with cruise control.  It had no problems going up the steep hills in the city.

<b>Inside:</b>
There is plenty of room inside with enough leg room in the 2nd and 3rd row seats for adults to be comfortable.  I noticed while sitting in the 3rd row of seats, my head came close to hitting the ceiling while going over bumps fast, but I am 6� tall.  It will seat 7 passengers and the 2nd and 3rd row of seats can be taken out and moved around in any configuration.  It comes standard with power windows and locks.

The 2 fronts seats have arm rests and the seats are very comfortable.  I was impressed that I was not tired of them after the 2 hour drive into the city.

It has 2 large glove compartments, 8 cup holders and another compartment in the center on the dash that will easily hold maps and books.  The LX model comes with an additional center console and you can add tables/trays as an option.

It has air vents and overhead lamps on either side of the 2nd and 3rd row of seats with controls.  Up front, there are separate AC controls for the front and back as well.

It�s easy to get into with large sliding doors on either side and a large lifting door in the rear.  The rear door lifts high enough for tall people to stand under.

<b>Exterior:</b>
The Sedona looks a lot like every new minivan on the road now.  There�s nothing unique about it�s looks, but it has clean lines and is nicely balanced with large headlights and large windows.  It has 15� wheels, which seem to fit its look well.  

<b>Safety:</b>
It comes standard with dual front airbags and side impact beams.  It does not come standard with ABS, but you can get both the LX and EX with ABS as an option.  

<b>Reliability</b>
This is unknown, but Kia/Hyundai seem to be confindent with the Sedona, it has a 5 year basic and 10 year powertrain warranty.  Both interior and exterior seemed well designed and durable.  It felt very solid, not rattles or strange engine noises even for a rental car.
