            When the time came to trade in my fiance's tiny Saturn SC1 coupe, we agreed to look for something with more room for us and my 15-year old son, plus some cargo room.  After visiting dealerships to see vehicles in person, reading the JD Powers &amp; Motortrend reports, and reviews here on Epinions, we decided on a Chevy Blazer.  Though we had wanted another Saturn, we both agreed that something bigger was needed.
We have the model pictured in the example, except in black with a gray cloth interior.  And the pictures don't do it justice--this is the sharpest-looking smaller-sized SUV we saw out of any.   We got the 1SC option package, which includes electric windows/seats, on-demand 4 wheel drive, CD and cassette player, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, remote keyless entry and security system, and the overhead console with temperature gauge and compass.  And plenty of storage space all around the vehicle in both front and back, which comes in very handy on long trips!
So far we are more than pleased with the performance and features of the Blazer and feel that we got our money's worth.  Though it has the usual cornering problems of any SUV, the Blazer drives much more like a car than a truck.  The sight lines are great, the tight suspension and steering give total control over the vehicle, and it sits just high enough to see over most other traffic while not being too big to park comfortably.  
I would recommend the Blazer to anyone who needs something larger than a station wagon but smaller than an actual truck, for work or long trips or just the daily commute.<br><br>
