            I have used a number of digital cameras (Sony, Kodak, Fuji etc.) over the last few years in my job as a teacher, but decided I needed to purchase my own with the birth of our first child.  We chose to go digital because of the amount of pictures we anticipated taking, plus the amount of film we new we might waste with a regular camera trying to get the best shots.  I did a great deal of research before making this purchase.  I wanted something easy to handle, a variety of picture quality options, good color and resolution, and a low price (around $300).  This camera met all of these criteria..yes, even the price (if you shop on Cnet, you can find some very good prices)! 

I have been thrilled with the performance of the camera.  The pictures are sharp and colorful.  The ease of use is a huge bonus.  I have taken close-ups, wide shots, bright light, and night pictures and they have all turned out remarkably well. It works just like an Olympus film camera.  I also bought the battery recharger and rechargeable batteries...a  lot cheaper than non-rechargeable batteries in the long run.  The software that comes with the camera makes uploading pictures a snap, plus you an edit your pictures with ease.   The only thing that didn't come with the camera that I wish would have is a camera case.

I would recommend this camera to anyone who is wanting great digital pictures but doesn't want to spend a fortune.  <br><br>
