            I received this camera as a gift about a year ago.  I was so excited to finally have a digital camera because I wanted to be able to upload pictures onto my computer.

I briefly read the owner's manual, which was well written and humorous.  Once I got used to taking pictures and the distance I needed to be for them to look good and clear without taking up alot of memory, the troubles began.

My husband has purchased rechargable batteries for me along with a charger.  This camera requires 4 &quot;AA&quot;  batteries.  I would only take 20 or so pictures before the camera would die out and I would have to recharge them again.

One time I couldn't wait for the batteries to recharge so I bought regular ones.  The same story.  This camera eats batteries so much that I'm thinking of taking out some stock in Duracell or Energizer.

I have taken out batteries that my camera said were used up only to press the batteries to see how much life was in them and the batteries registered full power.

The other problem I have had with this camera is that sometimes pictures don't appear when you are trying to crop them or otherwise edit them.  YOu get the message, 'unable to load picture'.  Othertimes, I have seen the picture, cropped it, saved it and go online to upload it on my personal web space, only to have it not come up.

It was a good started camera for someone who doesn't know much about them and only needs to have digital pictures for pleasure use.  There are no special functions on this, no zoom although it does have delay shooting so you can set up the family reunion shot and still be in it.

  I would have thought the Kodak name would have been reliable and that the product would have been as good as a regular Kodak 35mm camera.

My next digital camera will not be Kodak.  I think I'll put this dinosaur in storage.  Maybe the Smithsonian will want this for the next century as how not to make a digital camera.<br><br>
