            In preparation for purchasing a Sport Utility Vehicle, my wife and I recently rented a Mercury Mountaineer for a long trip (3000+ miles) over the holiday season.  Compared to the other SUVs we have taken out on demos, the Mountaineer had a remarkably smooth ride.  My wife particularly enjoyed the lumbar support in the front seats.  Plenty of cargo room, easy handling, and very easy &quot;in and out&quot; for both young and old alike.  We were slightly disappointed with the lack of &quot;consumer friendliness&quot; in some of the ergonomic design and other conveniences (interior door handles hard to get to, cup holders too small, etc.)Overall, however, we liked the Mountaineer and recommend it!<br><br>
