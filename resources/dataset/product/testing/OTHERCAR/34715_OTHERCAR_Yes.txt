            We bought a 1991 MPV van with high mileage (147,000)in 5/2000 in hopes of getting an inexpensive option for hauling up to seven people with the ability to tow.  We love how the van handles, plenty of power with the v6, and a few nice features like the rear a/c and tow leveler system.  

But our sweet deal turned into a sweet lemon when a week later a cracked head, worn valves, worn timing belt tensioner, and a number of electronic bugs (e.g. corroded a/c switch, driver side window &amp; lock, high beams flickering, dome light flickering...) cost us over $1,500 to fix.  I also learned from the mechanic I used that if the transmission goes you have to get a new radiator along with it, and that it usually went out as a result of people using non-dealer filters in the transmission, at a cost of $3,600!  

We still like the van but the engine remains a bit noisy.  After repairs we have $4,200 into it, which is not bad considering the tires, brakes, heads...are new on it, but still more than we wanted to spend.  It would be harsh to say it is a lemon, so I will call it lemonade.<br><br>
