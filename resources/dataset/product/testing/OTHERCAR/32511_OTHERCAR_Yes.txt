             The 2002 Audi A4 is a very impressive vehicle, I recently had the opportunity to see and test drive this vehicle. After my first introduction to the A4 in the Dallas Autoshow I was obsess with the car. It's level of sophistication was impresive even by Audis standard of technological breakthroughs. I have to admit that the technology that this company put in this car is actually practical. Companies like BMW with their new 7 series added technology that would make Bill gates scare to drive it. But in Audi technology such as a Continiusly Variable Transmission and the impressive 3.0 V6 engine with Quatto a highly sophisticated and practical AWD sytem. I strongly dislike the fact that you can't get the CVT transmission with the Quattro system. Instead you get a 5 speed automatic with the audi Steptronic Clutchess manumatic system. You do get buttons to shift in the steering wheel. But I stil like the CVT better.The styling is like a shrink A6 with a little bit of more refinement. I have to admit the A6 could use some of the A4 design features. I think the A4 looks a lot better on the dark Blue color with the 17 inch wheels. Leather is everywere and the wood is genuine. Not a paper over plastic immitation. This car is truly worthwile and family or not you definetly should drive an A4.
