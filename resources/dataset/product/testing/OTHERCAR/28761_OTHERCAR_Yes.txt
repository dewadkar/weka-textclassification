            I have a 1998 Honda Prelude Automatic.  It now has about 35K miles on it, and still is going strong.  I have not had a single problem out of the car what so ever.  I do enjoy modifying cars so the Prelude is no exception.  I have added an AEM performance air intake system, a DC Sports exhaust, and few bells and whistles here and there.  The performance of the car is amazing, but was FAR from poor without the mods.  The horsepower is wonderfull for a Honda and combined with the light weight of the car, it makes for one powerfull ride.  The four cylinder VTEC engine pumps out plenty of power, but does lack in the torque department (it is afterall only a 4 cylinder).  Also, the sport shift option on the automatic version is great for anyone who loves to feel more connected to the road or just have a neat toy.  On the outside, the car has great lines and style.  The front view of the car is awesome, giving a look that both the masculine and feminine minds can enjoy respectivly.  The interior is nice, but could be better.  The spedometer panel set up is great, but the air control area could be MUCH better and more modern in apperance.  The seats are fine for driving around town, but do get a bit rough in the long haul giving the car a true sports car feel.  Overall, the Prelude is a nice car that will satisfy the weekend racer and tuner well.
