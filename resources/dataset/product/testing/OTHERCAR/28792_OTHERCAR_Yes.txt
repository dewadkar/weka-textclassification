            3 years ago I was car shopping.  Something we all usually love to do, but hate the prices and settling for something we really aren't happy with.  Well, I was looking at SUVs at first.  It just so happens that one Sunday, my husband and I drove past the Chevy dealer and there it was!  My future transportation, the Chevy Lumina LTZ.  What a beauty!  At first I didn't care what it had, I just liked the look.  I told my husband that I wanted THAT car and I was buying it first thing in the morning.  The nex morning, he went to the dealership, signed the papers, called me and I came and picked it up (I didn't even test drive it!).  Little did I know how practical this car is.  Being the parent of a small child, I have to use a car seat.  The Chevy Lumina LTZ has one built right in the back seat.  I didn't know this.  I was thrilled.  It was fully loaded:  CD player, Leather seats, Air bags, Sun Roof, Aluminum Wheels, all electric, ABS, Dual Exhaust, Cruise Control, you name it, it had it.  The price?  That's the best part.  Only $21,000.  For what I got, that's all I paid.  It doesn't need a tune up until $100,000 miles.  I have never had an ounce of trouble and 3 years later, it still looks brand new.  The paint job is just as pretty.  The gas mileage is fantastic!  I get around 25 on the highway, 20 in town.   It has an optional 3.8L engine that gets you where you need to go.  If you have kids, please check out the Chevy Lumina LTZ.  It's a sporty car without the sport price.  Not only that, the insurance costs are low.  I also found out that it rated high in the vehicle crash tests, so that's extra piece of mind while driving it.
