            I bought this car in 1996 when I was attending college and driving a lot of distance.  I bought it because it was inexpensive for starters, it has great gas mileage, the Toyota name represents quality so it would probably be low-maintenance, and it looked stylish.  As a student, this was the perfect purchase.  Now that I am a mother of 2, I am ready to toss this car.  Only thing stopping me is that it's paid off.

Speaking as a mother of a 2 year old and a newborn baby, I can say that 4 doors is the ticket to sanity.  I have to lug a 25 lb kid into the back seat into a car seat.  Then I have to go around to the driver side and put an infant in a carrier, weighing altogether around 20 lb or so, into the back seat through a space not large enough for the carrier.   My back is totally strained now and I am beginning to resent my little car.  Now I know why people buy mini-vans after kids.

Well, after 4 years, the gas mileage isn't so great anymore.  The little repairs are starting to come up now.  I guess what I had initially bought the car for served it's purpose.  But I want a new one now!!!!  I would recommend a 2-door Tercel to child-less people only.
