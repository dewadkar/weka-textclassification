            This is a review of the vehicle pictured, which is a Subaru Outback Impreza.  It is a SMALLER version of the popular Outback wagon.  

I bought this car in June as a replacement for a small, gas-guzzling SUV that was giving me huge mechanical problems.  I wanted a car that would be easier on my wallet, would last me a while, and had all of the positive features of an SUV without the unnecessary expense. 

This car was the perfect compromise.

Equipped with a 2.5 liter, 4-cylinder engine, it produces about 165 hp.  This is plenty for a small-ish car.  I have the manual transmission.  Subarus are extremely easy to drive, even with the 5-speed.  I estimate with this setup that I get about 28mpg on the highway, compared to about 14-16 I was getting in my SUV.  It's amazing how much money I've saved on gas in the last few months!

The interior of this car is pretty much what you would expect from a mid-priced Japanese import.  The seats are comfortable enough, but not luxurious.  Most of the interior is fabricated of cheap-looking plastic, but if you're looking at this kind of car, you probably don't care.  It's also a style of interior you're going to find on just about any car in this price range.  There is actually a good about of cargo space in the hatchback style trunk - in fact, MORE space that I had in my Jeep Liberty - go figure!  The controls are well placed, easy to find and easy to use.  The rear seats have a 60/40 split, and fold FLAT, which makes for plenty of cargo space.  I was amazed at how much I could fit in this car!

The exterior of this car is nice!   I didn't like the earlier looks of the Impreza wagons, but Subaru did a nice job remodeling this car for 2004.  It has a stylish, sporty look, but doesn't have unnecessary extras.  They got rid of the bug-like headlights, and added sportier looking taillights.  The Outback Sport version of this car has a nice two-tone color scheme.  

Other features which are nice about this car is the fact that it comes with full time AWD, which requires no shifting or pulling of levers to activate.  Although I haven't had a chance to take it out in the snow, you can feel the added traction of this system in everyday driving, too.  It also comes equipped with ABS, a nice added safety feature, and 2 airbags in front.  

Of course, for a relatively inexpensive car (this is NOT a luxury car by any means) you only get what you pay for.  The features mentioned above are about the only thrills you get in this car.  The standard sound system is totally LAME!!!  I should have upgraded to a better system, and when I have some money to spare, that will be the first change I make to this car!  For someone who likes to listen to music, the crappy system they throw in is horribly weak.  Actually, that is about the only complaint I have yet found about this car.  The standard warranty is only 3yrs, 36K miles, but that doesn't seem to be a problem, at least with other Subaru owners I've talked to.  (I guess you have to wonder why other car companies need to offer more of a warranty than this... does that say something about their vehicles?)

The bottom line is this:  If you are looking for a car that has the features of an small SUV (4WD, ABS, good amount of cargo space) but you don't want to spend a fortune, get stuck with a gas-guzzling pig, and you don't need a lot of fancy frills, this is the car for you!  I know many, many Subaru owners who are so happy with their choice of car.  It supposedly handles great in all weather, too, so that's one less worry.

Look around as you drive.  How many Subarus do you see on the road?  Now that I own one, I feel like I see them ALL the time!

Hope this was helpful.
