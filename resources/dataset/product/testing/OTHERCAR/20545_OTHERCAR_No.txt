            I fell in love with this car (1999 Acura LS) when I saw my coworker's in the garage every day at work.  Sporty, low to the ground...very sexy-looking little car!

My love for the car blinded me to some of the &quot;annoying features&quot; during the test drive(s), and since it was very similar in design to my current car (1993 Eagle Talon) I signed the lease papers willingly.

A few weeks later, however, the flaws of this car made me wonder why I just didnt take it back to the dealer(I still  may)!  Any enjoyment received from the handling and look of the car is countered by:  

---No interior hatch release....very inconvenient to have to get out and unlock the door when it is raining, snowing, windy...you get the idea

---A CD player that would not turn on when the outside temperature fell below 40 degrees--finally worked after the car &quot;warmed up&quot; 20 minutes later (Player since replaced by dealer, but it now RATTLES all the time)

---Cup-holders that cant hold a dixie cup, much less your average medium sized coke from McDonalds....the CD player is useless when you do put a cup in because it completely blocks the controls...I have changed the channel when trying to jam the cup into the holder (forget putting the car in park....)

---I am not a short person (5' 7&quot;) and I have to lean awkwardly forward out of my seat every time I want to change a channel on the radio

---TINY, TINY gas tank.  I am at the gas station every week, and am I getting just below average mileage.

If anyone were to buy this car, I would see it being very attractive to a high school or college student.  This is a car that you really want to be seen in, but for long-term ease of use and comfort, is not a car that you want to own (thank god I leased!)
