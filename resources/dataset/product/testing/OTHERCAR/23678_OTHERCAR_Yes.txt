            Having shot my 2000 VW Jetta with a deer rifle (metaphorically at least) I was looking for something practical, yet fun.

I settled on the 2002 PT Cruiser Limited Edition for the simple reason that one of my 8 kids is obsessed with them, saying it looks like "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang." Not sure I agree but after I drove one, I knew I would like it.

PT's come in four versions in 2002; base model, Touring Edition, Limited Edition (adds leather and sunroof) and Dream Cruiser (limited to 7500 cars in mustard gold metallic.)

I got my Limited Edition for 20K, which is amazing considering it has leather interior, CD/cassette, power moonroof, power locks and windows, power seats, ABS and many more features.

This car is very, very fun to drive. Still very sharp looking when waxed and clean. (My black paint shows every speck of dust.) Acceleration is enough but barely. If you are looking for something fast, hold off for the rumored turbo coming this fall. The acceleration here is modest at best. (Not annoying but not fast, either.)

My observed gas mileage has been 19 in city and 26 on my highway commute. The tank is a smallish 14 gallons, so I stop a lot for gas.

The warranty coverage of 7 years or 100000 miles is a real plus. Currently expires on 5/31/2002 so check if they are still offering the deal as well as 1.9 percent financing.

My only issue thus far (2000 miles) has been a piece of one of the brakes that broke off and was quickly repaired by the dealer.

The gauges are nothing special at night, though the color-coded dashboard inserts are pretty cool. The moonroof is nice (if you are taller than 6-5 you may want to skip the moonroof) and the foglights are a nice addition to the Limited Edition.

UPDATE: At 12,000 miles this car is still quiet as a church inside and holding up well. Recalled once for minor adjustment. Sunroof switch replaced under warranty.

New 2003 model offers a turbo for faster acceleration.

UPDATE2: At 14K miles, still solid. Sunroof switch died again. Kids in rear seat often put feet on center-mounted window switches and raise/lower the windows.
