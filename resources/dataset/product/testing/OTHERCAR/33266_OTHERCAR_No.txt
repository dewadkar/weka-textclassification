            My husband bought one of these little beauties with only 13 miles on the odometer.  My first opportunity to drive it started on Dec 23rd, 1999 at 6:30 am.  Our fuel gauge read a quarter tank of gas and I figured once I had made my first stop at the construction site I work at, that I would fill up with gas.  Just as I approach the intersection in a very bad part of town, the truck sputters and dies, like it's out of gas.  I locked all the doors, and called my husband on the cell.  He brought me some gas and I continued on to the gas station.

  The truck has a 19 gallon tank, and I only was able to put in 11 gallons.  Once the truck was full, it ran fine.  At this time, the truck was only two weeks old.  We returned to the dealer and they serviced the truck, and I would like to tell you that all was well. 

 In the last 6 months, the truck has been in the service department 5 more times for the very same problem, and one time to have all 4 wheels aligned.  We hate this truck, as it it very uncomfortable to drive and we find that on trips that our gas foot begins to hurt.  Nissan is not willing to buy back our truck, only replace it.  Too scary a thought. Not only would I not recommend this vehicle to my friends, but is a constant source of amusement at the construction site.<br><br>
