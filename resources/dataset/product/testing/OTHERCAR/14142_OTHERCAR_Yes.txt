            My first digital after years with film cameras!

To stay with the times I had to make the transition, but was not prepared to re-invest thousands for digital equipment, especially when some of the features look rather confusing. (I did not like it when they started making film cameras automatic). So I found a good deal at the local Staples and bought a Fuji.

 I must say I am impressed. While I'm not going to make fine looking 11x14's with the images, it takes great pictures of general stuff, family, and, my greatest need at the time, auction items. It's just a good starter digital camera.

One thing I would highly recommend. The reason I got it at Staples, is they were giving away an Olympus Camedia floppy disk adapter with the purchase of a Fuji. This allows you to take the smart media card out of the camera, insert it into the adapter, and put it in any 3.5 inch drive on any computer. You then can take your photos off, reformat, and take more pictures. It works on almost any computer, (my notebook won't handle the Fuji's usb adapter) and it takes only a couple of minutes to install the software, get the pictures off, and reformat to do it all over again.
Great accessory!

One final note. A couple of weeks after I bought the camera, there was a fire in my town in the middle of the night. I went over to be nosy, took the camera with me, took some photos, and one of them was used for the front page of the local paper. The trick was that I got back from the fire, and e mailed them a photo while the thing was still burning. 

That's neat.<br><br>
