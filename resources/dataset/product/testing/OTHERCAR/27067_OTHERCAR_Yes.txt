                   I have had my DelSol for 4 years at the time I am writing this and I still feel I need to sit down and help give a opinion on this great little car. 
      My model happens to be a automatic Si and it has been a very good car for me and my husband.  I average about 300 miles on a tank ad the car has been virtually maintenance free.   At the time I am writing this I have over 130,000 miles on the original engine with just the routine maintenance. The car feels like a hard top and has all the safety issues of a hard top but when you want the feel of a convertible it only takes a minute to pop that top into the trunk.  The rear window goes down for even more of a roadster feeling.
      Not many negatives for me to come up with on this vehicle.  The top rattles a bit but that is to be expected at this age.  Also I would be happy to have a few more horses under the hood or at least a little more torque to get up a hill without it having to down shift.
     All in all I would not easily part with this car.  It has become part of the family.
