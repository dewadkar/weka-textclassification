            I purchased my Canon Powershot A100 new from amazon.com in September 2002.  I chose this camera for its compact size, attractive looks, and name brand.

EASE OF USE
This camera is incredibly easy to use.  I figured out how to take pictures without even consulting the manual.  The manual is well-written, and made it easy to do more complex things, like recording movies or setting the self-timer.

PORTABILITY
I was able to fit this camera into my purse.  It traveled with me pretty much everywhere.

PICTURE QUALITY
Even though I always set the camera to take pictures at the lowest image quality setting(thus allowing more pictures to fit on the memory card), they always looked great.  I never had problems with graininess or anything like that.

At the same time, it is important to note that I never enlarged any of my images.  

DURABILITY
My main problem with this camera was that it broke three months after I bought it.  I knew that the battery case was going to break;  it was very flimsy plastic and often didn't immediately respond to being released.  When the battery case did break, it made it so that my camera could no longer read the memory card, as that fits into a slot right next to the battery case.  When I sent my camera to be repaired, they said that it would cost a full $100.  

SHUTTER LAG
Sometimes it would take the camera several seconds to focus on an object, especially if it was in a dark setting.  This wasn't a big problem, but it was a little bit annoying.

BATTERY USAGE
I know that digital cameras are infamous for eating batteries, but I think that this camera was probably even worse than most others.  If I had the LCD screen on, the batteries would almost always be dead within a half-hour of usage.  If you do decide to purchase this camera, getting NiMH batteries and a charger is going to be a good idea.


OVERALL IMPRESSION
I loved my Powershot A100...for the three months that it worked.  While I think it does a great job at taking pictures, I don't recommend it to anybody because it has such flimsy componentry.  Frankly, I expected better from Canon.
