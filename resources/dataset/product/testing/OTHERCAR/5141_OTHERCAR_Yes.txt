            Dodge does it again!

As an owner of a new Dodge Dakota R/T 5.9 I am impressed.  I have been a long time follower of Chrysler products and traded in a 1994 Dodge Dakota for my new one.

Dodge did not spare any technology when they built this truck.  From the tight suspension, to an engine that just screams, it has it all.  The 5.9 (360ci) engine is all performance with exceptional gas mileage. There was a slight low end torque problem that was corrected by installing a new air system which I will highlight in another area.

There are a couple of things that could be improved upon however.  To start with, the windshield dogleg is very wide and creates a vision loss of about 20 degrees left or right.  One needs to be careful especially when there are pedestrians involved.    

Secondly, The seats are not as comfortable as my old truck and lack the adjustable lumbar support which came as a standard item in my old truck.

Other than the things that I mentioned, I have had no problems whatsoever with 14,000 + miles.  Everywhere I go I get compliments on the truck and that in itself makes it worth owning.<br><br>
