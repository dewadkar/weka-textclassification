            I own a white 1992 400E.  I just hit the 90,000 miles mark this week.  The car has a few problems.  First and foremost, the air DOES NOT work properly.  I have taken this car in to 2 different dealers and 2 other non-dealer mechanics and no one can locate a freon leak but the air does not cool.  It is only a fan that blows when the air is turned on.  This Mercedes in only 8 years old and should not be having this kind of trouble.  Also, the power steering fluid is constantly leaking out.  No one can find a leak for that either.  Are 4 mechanics wrong or is this car a money pit?  I live in Florida and WILL NOT drive this automobile another summer!  The name is not worth the heat!  Also, I have had this car for two years and have replaced the battery two times already.  I realize that Mercedes has a good name because they make a good product, but this particular automobile does not live up to it's good name!<br><br>
