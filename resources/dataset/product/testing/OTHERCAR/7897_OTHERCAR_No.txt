            I don't like this camera, and I would not recommend that you buy it.  I don't think that it judges the light well; it either underexposes or overexposes a lot of the time.  If you need to move into digital zoom range, good luck getting a picture in focus.  The picture will <i>appear</i> to be in focus on the little screen on the back of the camera, but just wait until you get home and see the picture on your screen.  Very blurry many times, and very disappointing.  

I recently bought this camera, and took it on vacation with me.  Many of the shots were acceptable, but I was looking for better than that...I was hoping to get tack-sharp shots, especially on my computer screen.  This is not what I got.  To get somewhat decent shots from this camera, you have to be close enough not to need to use the digital zoom, and the lighting conditions need to be perfect. (Not too light or too dark in all areas of the shot)  Otherwise, the camera will expose for the shadows, and the light details will get blown out, or the camera will expose for the lightest part of the shot and the darker sections will be black.  There is very little in the way of finding the best balance.  The camera seems to lock on to one area (you have no idea which it will choose) and expose for that area, ignoring the rest of the shot.  Traditional film cameras have advanced metering systems that usually can avoid doing this.  Maybe better digital cameras can avoid this also.  The only plus here is that you can try to reshoot based on the first exposure, and compensate by telling the camera to underexpose or overexpose by up to two stops in either direction.

I was hoping that I would be moving up when I bought this camera.  My last digital camera was an Epson, non-zoom, and just one mega-pixel.  I am not impressed with this camera, and would not recommend that anyone purchase it.  My feeling is that if I had stuck with  a "traditional" film camera such as a Nikon F-100, and used a decent lens, my shots would have been a lot better.  Maybe this is an unfair comparison, but I do not feel that I got my money's worth out of this camera.

To be fair, one other good point is that the camera seems to take decent flash pictures, and if left on auto-flash, knows when to pop the flash.  Here are a few links that will help you see some of the best examples of shots taken by me using this camera.  Please remember that these are about 15 of the <i>best</i> shots out of almost 250 taken in a week. (Copy and paste these links into your browser.)
