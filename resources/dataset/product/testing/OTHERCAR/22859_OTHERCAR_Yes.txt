            We had to upgrade to a larger van when our 5th child was born. With 5 children in car seats, a minivan nor conversion van were going to cut it.  We decided to go with the 15 passenger 3500 series and decided to go new. It has been the BEST investment we have made for our large family.  There is plenty of room for the children and my husband and I and anything else such as a large shopping trip or a long car trip.

The bad thing is the height, if your short, your gonna have to practice getting in and out.  But ya get used to it.  The seats are very very comfortable. The ride is very smooth. It has power up hills and pulling things behind.  

Gas can get steep in this especially with the rising gas costs, but it's better than taking 2 cars out with a large family or taking a small car or minivan and not having the extra room for a large shopping trip (was a DREAM for Christmas shopping!).

You can remove rows of seats if needed. We did just that and were able to buy a new washer, dryer and oven and come home in it with room left over. The seats were a bit difficult to get out because of their bulkiness and weight, but there were not that bad and easier than the previous minivanS we owned.

It was a bit steep in price, but that could be becuase we had always bought our vehicles with cash and never brand new.  :-)  This was completely worth it.  I love my "Monster Van".
