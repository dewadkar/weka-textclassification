            I bought a Subaru Outback Wagon in July.  I bought the 2000 model in black with two sunroofs, and in leather seats.  It has been a joy to own.  I have never had a single problem with the car.  It always operates well, drives very smoothly, has graet handling and steering, and most importanly to me it is a very reliable car.  When the snow storms hit town and all of Washington D.C. was unplowed and ocvered in fifteen inches of snow I was the only one in the neighborhodd who was able to get out and drive around.  The four wheel drive works brilliantly, better than I had expected.  I just plowed right through the snow without a problem.  Inside the car is also great.  The seats are very comfortable even in the back seat on a long drive.  There is enough leg room for me, an average size man, to sit in the back seat of the car and ride for a while.  The mileage on the ong drive is great also.  The mileage is around 25 miles per gallon on the highway and about 19 miles per gallon in the city.  That is very good mileage for any car and better than almost all of its competitors.  I now have near 6500 miles on my car and not a single complaint.  I put a lot of research in to making the purchase of a car and I hit the jackpot with this car I highly recommend it.<br><br>
