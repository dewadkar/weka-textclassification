            The new 3-series is by far and away the benchmark in it's class.  The previous 3-series surely was noticably more &quot;raw&quot; in its sporty undertakings, including aural sensations, but for sure, the new advantages outweigh the quoted disadvantages (compared to the E36 cars) by far.

The new chassis is exemplary.  The solidity alone speaks for the high price asked for this car.  However, in my opinion, even 40k is a bargain for this car.  Why do I think so?  In no particular order:

1. Looks.  Very classy and cohesive.  Definitely a BMW even from a mile away.  Excellent fit and finish inside and out (although, the truth is, if you pay close attention to little details, BMW products are certainly in the top echelon, but just not as good as those from recent Benzes and Lexus products).

2. Handling:  Nothing compares to BMW.  Truly the Ultimate Driving Machines.  And these new 3-series certainly join that group.  Even w/o the sport suspension/wheels, the car is fabulous in the turns and on the highway cruising.  The steering is incredible (how do they do that?!), if not a little less incredible than say, the current M3, and rack-n-pinion steering-based 5 series (in the USA, that would be the 528i solely).  Well at least that what I felt.  No matter, the chassis composure during any kind of driving is utterly impressive and unique in any price range.

3. Engine.  Inline-6 2.8L.  It is so well engineered the performance belies its size.  All this from 2.8 liters.  They really know how to do it those engineers.  I mean, with the 5-spd, it's very satisfying to learn how well this powerplant motivates this 3200 lb. car.  Rest assured, this baby will thrust ahead with urgency up until redline, literally.  Watching the speedo while flooring it in 5th gear will make you think you're feeding a much larger engine.  Utterly smooth too. Inline 6s are perhaps the best layout out there for this, better than V8s and some V-12s, and with the advent of things like double VANOS management, they are getting close to offering similar torque curves (people, this is *THE* most important performance criteria for your engine).  I'm very happy to say BMW, for one, is strictly adhering to their &quot;no V-6&quot; policy year after year.  They care about their trademark &quot;feel&quot; of their 6 pots more than anything else (like switching to V6s which take up less space in your engine bay).  Yes, there are quite a few V6s out there that are eerily smooth (Maxima comes to mind, and a couple from Acura), but the difference, that &quot;BMW&quot; feel, is all over the 3-series, yet again.  

4. Brakes.  Oh my Goodness.  Forget the data you see for 70-0mph, the 328i (323i close, tried it) has among the best brakes I have ever tried, include the exotics.  Not only that, to make a long story short, the design of the rotor/calipers interaction rids any possible occurrance of warped rotors!  That's engineering.  Large, vented all around brakes, with a FABULOUS system all around (13 inch rotors all around will not be a great upgrade on your car.  You gotta deal with the whole package; ABS system, computer assist at various levels, pedal feel and modulation at different levels, proper ventilation, matching brakes lines, fluid, calipers, pads, and perhaps the master brake cylinder).  And I hear the upcoming 330i will get larger (326mm up front!) brakes too.  Wow.

5. Interior:  They did a great job.  Now looks a lot like 5 and 7 series (in my opinion, arguably the best looking interior from the Germans, period).  Interior room now vastly improved, yet 3 people in the back is still a squeeze (but that is understandable, certainly).  And there is not enough storage space to satisfy quite a few buyers in the US market.  Oh well, there's something for future improvement!

6. Engineering/safety:  The new 6 cylinders have double VANOS.  If you know how that works you would appreciate it at least as much as any great VTEC version 3 application.  They also feature a temperature control map by a CPU.  Previously only available on the V8s from BMW, it's a feature that is a far cry from a simple thermostat controlling the temp. and fan settings at various loads and temperatures.  Basically it allows faster warmups when it &quot;senses&quot; it can do so (like when the driver just started up the car and is driving with a very light right foot), and more cooling when fully-warmed up when it &quot;senses&quot; it can do so (like cruising on the highway with a long enough duration of kick down).  If one of the brake lights burns out, a sensor rewires the power of the turn signal circuitry to cause that amber bulb to act as a brake light when the brakes are applied.  So you'll never be w/o 2 functioning brake lights. In a crash, the electric power is disconnected to prevent any threat of gas explosion, while retaining power to the headlights, hazard lights, interior light, and audible alarm which are all going off after the accident.  The doors unlock automatically.  In the event of a side-collision, there are hooks designed into the frames that &quot;catch&quot; the door trying to intrude into the passenger compartment, and thus creates a single solid part.  Immedeately after the impact, the lock &quot;unlatches&quot; for the door to be opened again.  There are an available 8 airbags!  The list goes on...

And that 5-spd shifter.  Fabulous.  Very very smooth and expensive-feeling.  It is made by ZF, while the one in the 323(C)i is made by Getrag.  It's almost as good, but the 328's is a little more precise.  One of the BEST.  The automatics offered are either std. 5 spd or the sportronic (+/- shifting ala Honda Sportshift).  Both are excellent, but the 5-spd is a joy to use for anyone with any enthusiasm towards driving.  Again, this is CERTAINLY not a poser car &quot;Look people!  I drive a NICE car!&quot;  Yes many will be sold to many w/o a clue about how great these cars are, but that's a tribute to perhaps the marketing department?  :)

Oh, almost forgot.  The ASC+T system is excellent.  However, even better, for year 2000 and onwards, DSC (Dynamic Stability Control, which offers oversteer/understeer (yaw) control in addition to the features of ASC+T) will be available.  Previously this was only for the 7-series.  One thing that is great about the BMWs is that their TC systems don't interfere as drastically as say the ones from Benz or Lexus, but still perform their duties eficienty and quickly.  Actually in the rain and snow RWD BMWs have been proven (with the new electronics controlling wheelspin and car drifting) to be *superior* to some FWD and even AWD cars!  Yes, they did tests in front of the public and professionals in Sweden and other areas.

The suspension design for these new 3-series is even better than before, being mostly aluminum, like the 5 series.  Incredible.  I cannot give enough praise for this car. I was driving it like a race-car it complete confidence for several minutes straight.

Reliability?  Never as good a point in a BMW as it is for Lexus or Benz.  But, they say these new 3-series are vastly improved, and the factories that build them were rated #1 in the world for auto-manufacturing.  That's gotta amount to something.

Also a navigation system is available.  It's decent (although I liked the Acura ones best), but the problem is you can't get the in-dash CD player with it.  Actually, you can't get the in-dash CD if you want the cassette player!  Geez, why can't they design it like say the new Acura TL, offering all 3 together in an uncluttered design?

Oh, and damn, do those Germans know how to paint silver!  Beautiful on this German car.  Oh, try to check out that special order color called &quot;Metallic Steel Grey&quot; for the 3-series.  I saw one in a showroom.  Awesome.  Any color is great on this vehicle.  But of course silver and blue/black will be the most popular as usual.

The entire package, if you really know what you are getting, is truly a bargain.  Worth every cent.  The attention paid to styling, the interior, engineering, performance efficiency, and sportiness is truly world-class.  
You might be thinking &quot;yeah I think I wanna give this new 3 a chance, but I wonder why to pay extra for the 328 over the 323&quot;.  Well there are a few things here and there that aren't offered in the 323 (just as an example I'll give you a couple, like the front seat nets behind the backrest, and the chrome lining as opposed to black at the exterior).  

Disadvatages: I can only think of 2:  Not enough storage compartments, and kinda small for serving as a family car.  But you and your family members will surely be treated to safety and fun.  Step up to the fabulous 5-series if you'd like more people/trunk space (and perhaps a little better isolation) but it of course costs a little more.  That's it.  Enjoy.<br><br>
