            Got my (non-Miller) end of 1995.  I have used it for some 7,000 mile cross country trips, and mostly local and short trips.  It is going in for the first repair in 4.5 years, a new switch on the Gas/Trunklid.

We get about 24 MPG on Regular, and have 37,000 miles.

I find it comfortable and quiet to drive, and only have one or two minor beefs:
      a)  It doesn't like to drive at 20 in school zones... My wife solves this by downshifting.

      b)  It seems a little sluggish on low range acceleration, but we usually drive for Mileage, and have other HOT cars (own 5) when we need kicks.

Our Dealer experiences are pleasant.  Depreciation has been too much versus, say, a Toyota Avalon.  But, if you are looking for a used luxury car, check these.  My impression is the non Miller Cycle engine would be a better used choice due to leak problems those have.<br><br>
