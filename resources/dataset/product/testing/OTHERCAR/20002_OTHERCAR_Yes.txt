            I leased a 99 ES300 because the monthly cost was far lower than other manufacturers offering near luxury cars with MSRP's between $35-38,000.  The dealer (Prestige Lexus) was very helpful and very low pressure.  I was equally impressed with all vehicles in this class.  However, you truly learn to appreciate the ES300 once you experience the car over a period of time.  It is absolutely one of the quietest automobiles I have ever driven including cars costing twice as much.  It is smooth and comfortable at all speeds and traffic conditions.  One may believe that the leather seats are too firm to be comfortable on a long trip but they really are . . . even after a 5 hour trip!  Generally, I own a vehicle for a few months before I am bored with it.  However, I love and respect my Lexus more and more every day I have it.  The fit and finish is incredible.  The car always looks classy whether you have just left a car wash or whether its been weeks since the paint has had a good scrubbing.

Another aspect that Lexus owners can appreciate over other manufacturers is the customer service you receive from the service departments.  They seem to love the vehicles they work on and care for them as if they were their own.  A member of the service department stayed late one night as I could not get there during normal business hours for the 5,000 mile service.  On the way, I hit a tire on the road and believed that the car was going to have serious damage.  I drove the car to the service department and the service man took my report.  He could tell I was concerned about the car so he told me he would bring it in (it was 8:30PM) and check it out right then.  The car checked out OK and I appreciate that he went that extra mile that so many just won't do anymore.

I feel proud everytime I drive my Lexus whether it be to work in full business attire or on weekends wearing jeans with my German Shepherd sitting in the back seat.  

Questionable areas are as follows:  I live in a cold northern climate and have questioned the dealer why the car does not shift out of 2nd gear until it is warmed up for about three miles.  Lexus holds that this is normal and is for pollution control.  The car will still do in excess of 70 miles per hour even though it is in 2nd gear.  Another issue which has been addressed in the 2000 model is the single temperature setting on the heated seats in the 1999 models.  Some people that have rode in my car believe that the seats get too hot to be comfortable.

It is certainly not the fastest auto on the road but it does have enough get up and go to please most drivers.  

In conclusion, I really have nothing bad to say about the ES300.  With over 10,000 miles on it since July 1999, it has given me nothing but reliable service.
