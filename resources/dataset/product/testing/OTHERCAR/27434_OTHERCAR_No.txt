            Talk about troubles! My husband and I poured more money into his Neon than it was worth. We finally got rid of it by paying someone to take it off our hands! Attractive, affordable and cute from the outside is what lured my husband to buy this car without investigating its history or record of reliability first. He never went more than 6 months without something major going awry. Within a year of his purchase we were shelling out thousands of dollars for faulty disk brakes, cracked engine heads, and bad exhaust systems to name a few. It had three recalls on it to boot. We both made sure regular oil changes were performed as well as tune-ups; and we both know how to drive a car as to not run it into the ground. After doing some research we discovered that Neons, especially this year and make, are notorious for the very same problems we encountered. Additionally, we had 3 different auto shops explain that to fix certain things on the car would cost more because Neon builds their engines in a cookey way- virtually hiding the most used parts (like where the alternator is located). They actually had to take apart some of the engine to be able to change the alternator (my husband's dad's life long friend who is a mechanic confirmed this so we know we weren't being taken for a ride). By the time we got rid of it, the AC didn't work, one of the pistons was bad, and you couldn't drive without the check engine light going on, and we were $3000 in the hole and that's not including the money we spent on repairs... and oh, did I mention that we couldn't drive over 35 miles per hour???!! It was the epitome of a piece of junk.
It was a learning experience to say the least. But I would like to strongly caution anyone from purchasing this car. You will regret it for a long time, especially in your wallet.<br><br>
