            I own a '95 Nissan Maxima with the 5-speed transmission. All 95-98 model year Maximas come with a 190 horsepower (205 ft.lbs. of torque), 24 Valve, Aluminum block V6. This engine has gotten numerous awards for its power, smooth action, and reliability. Acceleration in the '95 maxima is incredible for a 4 door family sedan. Going 0-60 in 7.8 seconds w/ the automatic transmission, and just under 7 seconds with the 5-speed manual(personally achieved), ranks it among luxury sports cars such as BMWs and Mercedes. 
  I love racing in this car because of the great acceleration and the smooth, fun-to-drive manual transmission. I have raced many fast-looking 2002 models and blown away most of them. I have beaten such models as a '01-02 Pontiac Grand Prix GT, '01 Mustang V6, and several Oldsmobile Aleros and Intrigues, to name a few. The only two lost races so far have been to a '91 Mustang GT 5.0 5-speed, and a '02 Stratus R/T coupe, both only lost by a car length or two. 
  The interior of this car is very comfortable and the controls for everything are easy to use and of high quality. The only thing I feel that is definitely missing from the interior is cup holders. If I had an automatic they wouldn't be quite as essential, but when you are driving a manual transmission, you have one hand on the wheel, and one hand on the shifter until you are at the desired speed and gear. A cup holder would help, but I find places to wedge a cup so that I can concentrate on driving first. I have an AM/FM/CD Bose sound system with 2 aftermarket 6X9's in the trunk. These speakers complemented by the high quality Bose system blasts sound and bass louder than I care to hear. 
  My Maxima currently has 122,000 miles on it, and has had no problems since the day I bought it. I always run Mid-Grade gasoline, or premium if I plan on driving a lot or frequent racing. DO NOT put regular 87 octane gasoline in a 95-98 Maxima, for I have heard many stories about problems with the "check engine" light and several parts under the hood due to low-grade gas. My car puts up with the occasional abuse of my hard driving, and doesn't give me any problems. This is a true sports-car in disguise. 
  If you plan on buying a maxima from the 95-98 generation, I highly recommend the 5-speed manual transmission. It is a blast to drive, and makes the acceleration quicker and gets better gas mileage. I get anywhere from 22-27mpg in the city(depending on the severity of my driving) and around 34-35mpg on the highway. The maxima has an 18.5gallon fuel tank so this means that I can go over 600 miles on a single tank on all highway driving. Typically, I get about 400 miles on a tank in the city. A Maxima of any 95-98 model year is highly recommended and definitely worth the money, for you will see how fast and luxurious a Nissan sedan can be. My next car will likely be a Maxima of a 2000-2003 model year.
