             The 2000 Toyota Celica is the 7th generation of Celicas. It has a great redesigned body, with sharp angles and great new headlights. Everything is different about this car from the last one except its name. Toyota has given it a new 1.8 liter I-4 engine with its new VVT-i technology. The GT cranks out 140 horsepower and the GT-s cranks out 180 horsepower! It is also light on feul, it gets about 28/38(city streets/ highway) miles per gallon. The interior has a great new dash with cool looking dash and the most comfortable bucket seats yet. The sound system is excellent, so blast the music loud. The car has a great &quot;No more Mr. Nice Guy&quot; look. The totally new redeisgned 2000 Toyota Celica is a great competitor to the Mitsubishi Eclipse(which offers a 200hp engine) and the Mazda Miata( very weak engine). The Celica handles incredibly well and the new E-shift technology allows you to swith from manual to automatic transmission. The Celica is awesome and I am hoping to get one. Also, it is only available in a coupe.<br><br>
