            I got my Saturn SC new in 1992 because I wanted a lightweight, sporty, domestic car that looked cool. The retailer was excellent. No hassles. No haggling. I love the plastic body! No dents. No rust. The SC with the 5 speed manual trans is fun to drive. Quick and nimble. Nice steering that's variable based on road speed so it tightens the faster you go. Good brakes even without ABS. The original Firestone Firehawk GTA tires lasted over 40,000 miles and don't cost too much to replace. Gas mileage is good if you control your right foot you can get 30 mpg in mixed city/highway driving. On the way to the Homecoming event I got 40 mpg cruising at 65-70mph most of the way there. Did I mention the plastic body? NO dents, no dings, no rust. Some scratches but those can be buffed out. The coupe is a nice alternative to imported sport compacts that I checked out at the time. Doing the routine oil changes and so on is very easy with most things were you can see them and reach them so you do it yourself. With a jack, jack stands and a set of metric sockets I could do the oil, oil filter, air filter, fuel filter, spark plugs, struts, springs, brake pads, hubs, drums, rotors, control arms, tie rods, aftermarket radio and speakers, and most stuff like that using the factory service manuals. I put a lot of miles on my SC and the roads around here gave it a good beating but it held up relatively well. After over 7 years and 182,000 miles my SC was good until sadly it was totaled in a wreck. I got another SC2 (the Saturn SC became the SC2 in 1993) to replace it. Anyone looking for a small sporty car should consider the Saturn SC/SC2 coupe unless you need back seats with room for adults, then get the Saturn SL2 sedan or the SW2 wagon if you need to haul a bunch of stuff. Get the twincam engine and the 5 speed manual for best results. <br><br>
