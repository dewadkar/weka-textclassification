            There was a period in history, in which Toyota built interesting cars. In 1966 and 1967, in fact, Toyota was building what was perhaps the coolest car in the world, the 2000GT. But I am primarily referring to the 1980�s through the mid 1990�s when Toyota produced a volley of entertaining cars like the Corolla FX/16, Celica All-Trac, MR2, and Supra. Then, as the 1990�s got under way, the Corolla went from fast to family, the Celica turned into a "chick-car", and the MR2 and Supra fell victim to hefty insurance rates. So, for about five or so years, Toyota�s became what your mom drove, and little more (although, Toyota is still battling this problem today). As the new millennium has rolled about, though Toyota has made efforts to get back on top. The MR2 is back in sexy drop-top form. The Celica has regained its manhood, and Toyota Racing Development (TRD) is doing marvelous things with the humdrum Solara coupe. Though the market is a bit obscure and prone to buying used over new cars, the street racing sub-culture in Southern California has taken off quite a bit in the last seven years as young speed freaks have embraced small Japanese car bodies and engines for their ability to withstand the riggors of aftermarket tunning.

Yes, things are indeed looking up. But what about the kids? When I was in high school back in the early 1990�s, boys and girls alike were enamoured over the smoothly redesigned Tercel. In years recent, as other manufacturers have raised the bar on styling, performance, and content in this economy-minded class, the Tercel had subsequently not aged well. According to Toyota�s USA General Manager, Don Esmond, �Toyota�s future success lies in its appeal to young buyers looking for something new, different, and affordable.� Those buyers that he is referring to are actually two groups. The first are the very late generation �X� children, born in the mid to late 1970�s, up until 1981. Second are those known as the �net-generation�, or the last children of the younger baby-boomers, born after 1981, but before 1988 (though this generation is on-going, children today will not be old enough to buy new Echo�s). I am actually considered part of cynical generation �X�, as I was born in 1976, so I will speak with authority about the automotive needs of this whiny group of people. We grew up with nobody to watch us after school, except Voltron, everyday, channel five, four o'clock. Women�s emancipation of the 60�s, the free spirited culture of the 70�s and career fair of the 80�s left lot of us in single parent homes.  We feel that this has made us deep and street smart and for now, we utterly deplore the conventions of our parent�s generation. We use words and phrases that our elders couldn�t possibly understand, such as 101-ism, Architectural Ingestion, and Dumpster Clocking. We all spent the 80�s in the back seat of a mini-van, and subsequently refuse to ever own one. Also, many of us disapprove of SUVs because we have embraced the environment, and refuse to conform.

Understanding all of this, Toyota became scared because there was a notably large, upcoming demographic that wouldn�t be caught dead in a Camry or a 4-Runner (the average age of a Toyota buyer is creeping up around 50 now). In 1994, the Chrysler Neon took the normally drab economy car market and gave it a whole new twist by making the cars catchy and exciting. Not wanting to be left behind, Toyota needed a new product. What they needed was, unfortunately, something that Toyota has difficulty understanding how to build � something cute and fun.  Enter the Echo.

Toyota already could build quality and socially responsible cars, so that piece was taken care of. The rest was a crapshoot. A friend of mine bought an Echo last year, much against my advice. Seeing her makes me believe in Toyota market evaluation. She is a Gen-Xer, in her early 30�s. She is fun, cute, and environmentally friendly (she usually rides a bicycle around town). She is single, hip, and works as an interior designer for a trendy urban firm � almost spooky, huh?

Convinced that I would see things her way with a brief drive, she brought the new Echo by my office for a test drive. Part of the Echo�s charm is that it appears very purpose built. This is appropriate because to many, the Gen X motto is �everything you need, nothing you don�t�.  The car is aptly sized for friends and stuff, and little more. Circling the bottom of the car and up over the wheel wells is an optional wrapping of some sort of black plastic-paint affair. This protects sensitive areas of the car�s sheet metal and paint system from chipping and rusting- this I like. A popular new philosophy in car design that I call �short-talling� is employed. The idea is to decrease the overall length of the car substantially, to make urban parking and visibility better. Then you make up for the lack of interior space by increasing the height of the car. This not only gives generous headroom but also makes the interior seem open and airy, because the greenhouse or section above the beltline containing all of the glass is expanded. Sometimes it works, like on the Chrysler PT Cruiser, sometimes it doesn�t. The nice black, protective trim makes the wheel-wells appear larger than they are, which in turn makes the ties look overly small. Mix this with a proportionately tall body, and the Echo looks a bit like a linebacker wearing ballet slippers. Without the trim, the Echo's body seems even more overwhelming dor the tires. 

The whole car, in fact, seems a bit too purpose built. A little fluff is necessary in any car, otherwise you have a World War II era, Willys Jeep � and this car is not far off from that. Toyota seems to feel that an over-involved design is quirky, which it is often not. If you have clear and well thought out concept in a product, it will make all of your decisions for you. Though the form and details seem to play into the idea of the car, some of the Echo�s design work seems overwrought and unnecessary.  This is especially true on the interior. Textures feel well integrated but below typical Toyota standard. The shapes and lines are very disconcerting and the center-focused console just seems different for the sake of being different. Toyota claims that the center mounted instrument cluster is easier to read because there is less focal-length disparity for the eye�s to adjust to. There is some truth to this as my eyes took less time to adjust from the road to the speedometer.  However, being so far away from the driver, the speedometer had to be so large that a tachometer wouldn�t fit. Also, the fuel gage and idiot lights are not as easy to decipher. There are lots of great pockets and cubbies for CD�s and cell-phones � staples of the Gen-X lifestyle, and interior comfort and space are surprisingly acceptable. The trunk seemed large enough to accept a tuba. Power comes from an evolution of Toyota�s variable valve timing technology. The VVT-I (Variable Valve Timing with Intelligence control) is supposedly like a Honda VTEC with a higher IQ. Tree huggers and penny-pinchers listen up because this internal combustion engine that makes 108 horsepower can see 41 miles per gallon on the highways. Around town, the Echo darted in and out of traffic without too much difficulty, though the engine was surprisingly buzzy.  The manual transmission Echo can rip off 0-60 in a respectable 8.8 seconds. Opt for the 4-speed automatic and some of the crudeness will dissipate, but you will lose more than a second off of that 0-60 time. At 170 feet, 70-0 braking is good for this price class. The car felt solid while rumbling over the broken patchwork of Richmond city streets, though it�s light weight and skinny tires caused the car to bounce about, disconcertingly at anything over 35 miles per hour. On twisty back roads, the Echo fought me all the way. Body roll was excessive, despite a trailing arm integrated independent rear suspension, and it didn�t take much to unset the tires and make them squeal like Ned Beatty in Deliverance. On smoother pavement, tire performance improved, leading me to believe that the rubber was chosen for a smoother ride rather than grip.  Steering had a nice feel to it, not being overly quick or under assisted, but the car does not like to be tossed around, so what�s the point. After feeling the instability at low speeds, I had to experience this buzz-bomb on the freeway. I talked my friend into extending the drive and we hit the parkway. Top speed on the Toyota is governed to 109 miles per hour, but this car felt spooky above 55. At highway speeds, interior noise was noticeable and the car didn�t track very well in its lane. Skinny tires and a tall physique mean that breezes play with this car like a Ping-Pong ball.  Crosswinds from passing trucks make the Toyota feel as it were driving on a road of Jell-O, and swift lane changes feel terribly wobbly as the top-heavy Echo tries to catch up to where you send the tires. Passing power is unimpressive too. He whole effect makes you want to keep your Echo as an urban skate-about that never sees long distance travel. 

Echo�s have not been leaping off of the showroom floors, even in Europe, where the car is sold as the Yaris, and cars of this formula are often successful. It is safe to say that, thus far, the sarcastic, twenty-something Gen-Xers and computer-savvy teens, have not embraced the spunky new, youth oriented Echo. It�s easy to see why as the Echo finds itself too tame to appeal to young males and too utilitarian to appeal to young females. Compared to economy cars of 10 years ago, this is a terrific car. But in today�s market, the potential Echo buyer can also choose the Ford Focus, Dodge Neon, Saturn SL2, Honda Civic, or Mazda Prot�g�. All of these models feature competitive quality, perform better, look classier, and have far more and better features at roughly the same price. I used to blame executions like this on the Japanese misunderstanding our culture. They would also, occasionally place rebadged Asian models on our streets thinking that what works in Osaka Kansai will surely work in Grand Rapids (remember the first Toyota minivan?) But this I fail to understand as the Echo was designed in California, and after considerable research on the part of Toyota. The Echo hit the market promising a lot for a little. But these days, where performance and civility are the norm in economy cars, the Echo is being left behind. Gen-Xers might call the Echo a victim of Japanese Minimalism � a design aesthetic used by rootless, career hopping young people, that is appreciated only because those over 35 don�t get it. Please do not misunderstand, I still believe that Toyota builds terrific cars, but given the sensibility of the market and exemplary competition, this simply isn�t one of them.
