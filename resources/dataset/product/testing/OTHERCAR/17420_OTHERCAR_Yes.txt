            This car has to be one of the best things you could spend your money on. I love the look of all SUV's and the Toyota 4Runner caught my eye. I test drove it and I knew I had to have the car. It had a totally silent engine which is great because a lot of SUV's have rather loud engines. To drive this thing feels like driving a car, except it's a little bigger. It handle's the corners great, I feel like I have total control over the road. I thought that getting an SUV would be a lot different than the little car that I used to drive around in, and it's not really. The only thing I don't like about it is the gas. It get's good mileage for an SUV, but I'm used to a little 4 cylinder engine car. This is great just everywhere. In the snow last winter I didn't even have to shovel out my driveway when I was late to work because it just climbed right on over the snow banks! I wouldn't recommend this car for people who think that just because you are in a 4 wheel drive vehicle that you can do anything, it has great traction, but you need to be careful in any car. I would defiantly recommend this car for anyone who wants/needs a reliable vehicle and lives in a snowy area or for someone who camps a lot (it has a VERY smooth ride in the woods according to my boyfriend). It has a lot of space and it's very roomy, but you still feel like your driving a smaller vehicle. The air conditioning and heat come out cold and hot right when they should, barely even 30 seconds needed to let the car start and get acclimated. It's a great car that I think everyone should drive at least once!
