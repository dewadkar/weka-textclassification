               This is my third Mazda truck,a B4000 4WD extended cab,  so you may think I like Mazda trucks!! However, the Mazda truck is really a Ford Ranger in disguise. In fact, open the drivers side door and read the manufacturer's statement.     The B4000 engine, a V6 4.0 liter powerplant is very reliable and very capable of heavy duty towing. I have used the 4WD often to pull my boat out of water with no difficulty. A drawback to this truck may be its gas mileage. It very rarely will exceed 17 mpg on the highway and 15 mpg during city driving.     What attracts me most about this truck is its good looks inside and out. I chose the light prairie tan exterior and tan interior. The sound system is excellent with the optional CD player which has performed flawlessly. All electrical accessories function properly and the additional power outlet is handy for the cell phone. The custom wheels and tires match the truck well. As you may guess, I love this truck!!    <br><br>
