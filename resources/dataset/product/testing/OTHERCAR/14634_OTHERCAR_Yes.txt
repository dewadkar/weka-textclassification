            I have only owned the 2002 300M Special for two months, but I've driven it enough to be able to compare it to some of the other cars I've owned or driven, such as the Acura RL, Jaguar XJ, Volvo S80. For the money (under 30,000), there is no car currently on the market which comes standard with all of the features the Special has. You have to compare it with the top of the line cars from BMW and Mercedes if you want to find the same standard package, such as 18" wheels, Xenon headlamps, manual shift capability, leather interior, power passenger seat, heated front seats, 255 horses, etc. You do your homework, and if you can find ANY car with just the features I listed, in a  standard package for less than 30, you have powers beyond those of mere mortals. I get many compliments on the Special, and the only change I made was to have the dealer chrome the 18" rims. This car performs just under the level of serious sports sedans costing much more. Stoplight racers will love the autostick, and the tranny performs well even when using the regular automatic setting. Don't challenge any Vipers, Porsches', or Ferraris, but go ahead and dine on all American sports sedans, and all but the top Euro sports sedans. There is no roomier car at this price either. You have to step up to the 40,000 Lincoln LS for this kind of room, and the LS doesnt come with as many standard features and does not have the exciting styling of the M Special.
