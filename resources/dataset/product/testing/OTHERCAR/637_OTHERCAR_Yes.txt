            I purchased the CoolPix for use as an adjunct to my photography business.  The camera is compact and easy to use for basic digital photography with a little bit of effort.  The 2.11 megapixel images are very clear.  And the matrix monitoring system gives great exposures.  The camera has the capability of doing much more with a little research, experimenting and practice.  

The camera uses AA batteries eliminating the cost of expensive battery replacement.  The built in flash works reasonably well.  However, the camera has the advantage of offering the capability of using off camera flash.  

The compact flash card gives the camera unlimited storage capabilities with great flexibility.  The camera comes with an 8mb card but cards with much greater storage capability can be purchased.  These cards are easily downloaded to your computer in a matter of seconds with the use of a very reasonably priced compact card reader.  

I have used the camera when doing sports teams.  I take team photos along with individual athletes and have a variety of items available for sale.  Two of the more popular items are buttons and magnets.  The CoolPix enables me to store the images of individuals, come home and download them, print them out and make the buttons and magnets all in the same day.  The prints are outstanding and my customers are greatly pleased. 

 There is unlimited potential to use this camera for profit or fun.  I would recommend this camera to anyone from beginner to professional.  <br><br>
