            My wife had a sports car and she wanted something with more room. She decided on an SUV. At first we were looking at larger SUVs like the Explorer and Pathfinder. They turned out to be a little expensive and too &quot;big and trucky&quot; for her. We looked at other SUVs (CRV, Sportage etc.). We were not impressed. 

When we got to the Toyota dealership we saw a silver fully loaded RAV4. The fully loaded ones always catch your eye but are usually just out of your wallets reach, not here. A loaded RAV4 is about the same as many other base model SUVs. Ok it has to be a lower quality vehicle, right? Wrong. We give it a test drive. Fun and quiet are the best ways to describe it. It is very quiet, I just had to say that again. 

I went with the RAV4 for a couple other reasons. I know too many people that own Toyotas and have those 100,000+ mile stories. So I was confident that the reliability and dependability would be there. And second the attention to detail on the RAV4 is great. It seems like they assigned an engineer to even the smallest areas.<br><br>
