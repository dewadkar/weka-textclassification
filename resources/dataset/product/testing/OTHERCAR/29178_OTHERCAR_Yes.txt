            I just want to start out by saying that I don't know anything about cars (excuse me for being a girl).  I've been driving cars that are 10 years old or more since I first started driving.  I started out with an '89 2-door Honda Civic Hatchback, then went on to a '92 2-door Geo Metro, then was driving an '87 2-door Volkswagen Jetta.  As you can tell, I'm extremely used to driving cute, tiny little old cars and driving a stick-shift (and I loved every one of those cars).  Recently I had to give up my Jetta (that's another story) and desperatly needed a car, but like most of us, had no money.  I decided it was time for me to get a new car.  Ok, well a '99 is pretty damn new to me (I am not talking to you people with money!).

The best deal I found was a '99 2-door Dodge Neon with 27,000 miles on it.  It cost me $7900 with a 3 year warranty, every other service is free, and I get a free rental car when I take it in for service.  The car looks brand new, inside and out, I kid you not!  The car runs so smoothly, I feel like I'm on a flawless road (this is impressive taking into fact that I live in D.C. where the pottholes are more common than politicians), and when I roll up my windows, I hear nothing of the busy, loud streets.  

The inside is is very good looking.  The seats are incredibly comfortable, and there is so much space for my legs (I'm 5'11) and my head, including everybody else who always wants a ride home (now that I've got a new car).  Ok, ok, I've only had it for 2 months, but it already had 27,000 miles on it and there is absolutely no sound coming from the engine, and I think it will be a long time until I have to bring this car in for service.  The speakers sound great as well.  I'm so happy that everything works, but that's probably because there were so many things wrong with my other cars.

There is little space in the front for drinks and knick-knacks, but there is a change holder, an ashtray, and cup holders, and I don't even know what I'm complaning about because I didn't even have any of those things in my other cars.    There is a mirror on my side on the sun-visor (or whatever it is called) and the sideview mirrors can be changed remotely.  

The problem I have been having is with parking.  But that's because I've never had a trunk, only hatchbacks where the rear window indicates the end of the car.  I'm also not too fond of the wing on the trunk (I know it's supposed to save you gas, I'm not completely ignorant) because it blocks half of my view in the back.  But I've been told that it is removable, so problem solved.  I'm used to better gas mileage from my old cars, but I'm also told that for a normal car, I get pretty good gas mileage.  DO NOT ask me what it is, I am a girl!  The best I can explain is that a full tank lasts me about a week and a half, driving about 20 miles per day.

Altogether, I wouldn't trade it in for any other car ,except maybe for a Mercedes, or a Jaguar, or....anyway, you get my point.

Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention that it's an automatic, which makes my life so much easier in traffic (even though I love driving stick shift, it's a little annoying after I've been on my feet all day and then I get stuck in traffic, it just becomes a little too much exercise).
