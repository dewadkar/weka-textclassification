            I have a lot of Sony stuff, so naturally when I started looked into Digital cameras, I looked at the Sony models, along with others. Because the feature sets this camera listed matched my needs (at that time, anyway) better than the rivals, I purchased it this last Christmas, and have been using it for the past 1/2 year or so. 

The camera is easy to use and setup, unless of course you are looking to tweak obscure settings every couple of pictures. All of the settings are easily accessed through the LCD menuing, with some available via the function buttons. 

The LCD screen is very usable indoors and outdoors. It is slightly hard to see in very bright sunlight, so as other have said, an optical viewfinder might have been a nice touch, but I have not found it necessary yet. Also, the LCD can be positioned in almost any conceivable angle, mitigating many of these visibility issues. 

The stick media is easy to use and compact, and yes, very proprietary to Sony. However, I have not (yet) found it to be any more expensive per MB than other media, such as CompactFlash. 

The MGI Software that came with the camera is OK, but could be more functional. It suits the essential need however. 

One thing I have had difficulty with is the images when using flash -- skin tones tend to gray out a bit, losing some of the natural warmth of the skin tone. I have found that using the Midnight or Midnight+ setting works well to fix most of this. Also so tweaking with the flash intensity settings helped as well. 

Overall, this is a great camera that I am using regularly with much pleasure and success.
