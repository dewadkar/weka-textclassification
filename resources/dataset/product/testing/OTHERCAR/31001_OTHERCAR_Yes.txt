                 <b>F</b>rom any angle the 2002 Dodge Ram is huge! Inside, it boasts one of the most spacious cabs in its class, with ample room everywhere. Turning the key brings the optional 4.7 liter V8 to life. There is also the 5.9 which has a little more torque and power on par. But the 4.7 is no weakling, it has an adequate 235 HP, enough to haul around most anything you want, just don't expect to win any drag strip races, personally I feel that Dodge should have upgraded for the 2002 model year to more powerful engines. The base V6 and the 4.7 come with an all new 5-speed automatic, the 5.9 still comes with the 4-speed automatic, which gets terrible gas mileage, rated at 15 MPG on the freeway! The 4.7 with the 5-speed automatic gets around 21 MPG; fuel economy you can live with (at least for now). Rugged and very spacious, the Dodge Ram is perfect for a night on the town or working on the ranch.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

     <b>Performance:</b> The 2002 Ram is offered with a 3.7 liter 210 HP V6, a 235hp powered 4.7 liter V8, and a 5.9 liter V8. My advice is to get the engine in-between; the 4.7. This engine not only gets as good gas mileage as the V6, but you get the extra power, and unlike the 5.9 you get the all new 5-speed automatic transmission. I do like the 5.9 but it only offers 10 more horsepower than the 4.7 and honestly I couldn't feel that big of a difference in out-right performance, however there is a much more aggressive sound that comes with the 5.9. One should note that even with the horsepower offered from the 5.9 powered Ram, it's no road racer, although it does offer slightly more aggressive road manners than the smaller 4.7. Handling is what you would expect from a big truck. Body lean is present in sharp turns, and aggressive driving can get almost scary on narrow twisty roads. The Dodge Ram is capable off-road just as much as it is on-road. Driving over large rocks, and climbing steep hills at low speeds in 4-wheel drive is a piece of cake.  

    Beneath the 2002 Dodge Ram's aggressive skin is a ladder-type frame, built from heavy-gauge steel. Standard <b>suspension</b> consists of unequal length wishbones, coil springs, and shocks up front, plus a live axle and leaf springs at the rear. Even with the 4x4 option, the Dodge Ram still retains a relatively comfortable ride. ABS brakes are optional.


<i>Interior Innovation:</i>
     

The <b>interior</b> of the Dodge Ram is very 'car-like,' and boasts considerable interior refinement for a full sized pick-up. Amenities are everywhere you look, cold AC, tachometer, supportive luxuriously equipped power seats, 4 swing out doors, and a  boombing sound system makes this  truck a class leader in interior innovation. The quad cab has 3" less bed space so the back seat room is larger, 60/40 split bench can be found in the rear. The plastics used throughout the cabin are a tad on the cheap side, however are a huge improvement over the previous generation Dodge Rams.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

     The <b>exterior</b>, is... well, very macho, bold, and screams "Get the heck out of my way". The Dodge Ram is one of the most aggressive looking 2002 modeled trucks on the road, perhaps the Ford F350 V10s being slightly more aggressive. There is a larger grille this year, and wider body colored moldings. In terms of overall presence, this truck is like the Dodge Viper, only in truck form.

<i>Pricing:</i> 

  Part of the Dodge Ram's tremendous sales appeal is its big grille, and macho appearance. This gives it an all-American look combined with modern styling cues. Love it, or hate it, you certainly can not ignore the current Dodge Ram pickup. Base <b>price</b> starts at around $21,000 but can run upwards of $37,000 with every option.

   Since this is a 2002 model, I don't think anyone can comment on reliability quite yet, but I forecast this will continue to be a solid truck for years to come, that will not only prove useful, but also give the owner pleasure he or she never thought possible from a 'Dodge' truck. The 5.9 liter is a proven engine.
