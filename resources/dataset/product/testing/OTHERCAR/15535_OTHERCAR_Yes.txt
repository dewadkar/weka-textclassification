            The first time I saw a Sebring convertible, I almost ended up underneath it. I was crossing the street when all of the sudden a Sebring bolts past the yellow light and the driver hits hard on the brake to avoid hitting me.  He stopped within, and I swear this, an inch of my leg.

I was about to scream and pound my fist on the hood, when I actually got a look at the car.  My jaw dropped and I stood there, admiring it's creamy beige leather interior and its sharp, black lines on the exterior.  The driver was some yuppie suit, who was holding a phone in one hand and a Coke in his steering hand.  He looked me in the eye, flinching, waiting for me to lose it.  I looked back at him and my lips silently formed the word, &quot;Wow.&quot;  He smiled, proud that his car was gorgeous enough to help him avoid a beating.

After that I wanted a Sebring.  A friend of mine told me that it was the most beautiful car he'd seen on the road lately.  Usually I think this guy is a moronic loudmouth, but in this case I agreed.  I wanted a Red Sebring convertible with all of the trimmings, but I figured that it was a pipe dream.  I'm a practical gal and I have &quot;sedan&quot; written all over me.

Then one day I was walking past a Chrysler dealership and I saw a couple of hot, used cars.  The Acura Integra was pretty sweet; a red stunner with black leather interior and it was only $17k.  The next car was a white Sebring JX, which was cool, but I don't have a penchant for white.  Then I saw it- my true love had finally appeared. A red Sebring JX, only one year old and in really good condition.

The dealer offered me his hanky so I could wipe the drool from my chin, then started in on the pitch.  I wasn't looking to buy a car that day, but I thought it couldn't hurt to at least see what I could get for it.  I had the  sales crew stay three hours after closing, trying to get me to buy that car.  At nine o'clock, I drove home with the car of my dreams.

But for every dream, there is a price to pay.  My particular car sometimes rattles in the interior, as if the door didn't close completely because a seat belt got stuck in the jamb.  The car is also too long for my comfort. I live in a place where parking is hard and I know that parking won't be as easy as it was for my sweet little Celica.  I also don't like how there isn't enough storage for little things.  There's no tape storage area near the cassette player.  The ash tray is a removable compartment that fits into the cup holder.  The ragtop creates these whopping blind spots in the back corners of the car.  The trunk space is a joke.

But all of that is stuff I can cope with, since the payoff is amazing.  Pulling that top down and crossing the Golden Gate Bridge on a sunny day, watching the people watching me, while their jaws drop and their mouths silently form the word &quot;Wow&quot; makes it all seem worthwhile.<br><br>
