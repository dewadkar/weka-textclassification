            Husband and I decided to buy this 1995 Oldsmobile Cutless because it was Value Priced meaning that there was no haggling with sales men about the sticker price of the car.  What you see is what you got.  

I love the car it is very roomy for our family of 4.  The seats are comfortable and it is a nice riding car.  We were in an accident in 1996 and the vehicle subtained major damage.  Now no comments on female drivers!  If it had been a smaller car we would have been injured I am sure.  The car was 500 dollars from being totalled.  My kids were in the back seat and nothing happened to them or myself.  We were all seat belted and car seated in.

The driving of the vehicle is smooth.  The steering is somewhat loose compared to the small car that I use to drive.  Nothing major had gone wrong until it hit 170,000 miles and then the transmission went out.  The car was not babied at all.

I think it is a great, reliable family car.
