            Ever since 1993, I have wanted a Nissan Maxima.  One of the main things that attracted me to it was the styling.  The first time I saw a Maxima  was in the showroom back in 1993.  I thought it was one of the sexiest and most sophisticated looking midsize cars around.  I even thought the interior well complimented the exterior (simple but nice looking).

The Maxima in the showroom was a nice metallic gold color with a tan cloth interior.  It was fully loaded (of course) with automatic transmission, power windows and locks, Bose stereo, and a power sunroof.  It had sexy but simple looking alloy wheels on it.  I instantly fell in love with the car!  Then I looked at the window sticker and noticed the price.  I instantly came crashing back down to reality and looked at what they had in their used car lot.

When the Maxima was redesigned back in 1995, the exterior styling took a turn for the worse.  The front end maintained a sexy, sophisticated look, but the rear end looked as if it had been rear ended.  It's just flat and plain.  This rear end got even worse looking the following year.  However, the interior looked much more expensive than the '94 and older Maximas.  It seemed as if the materials used were of a higher quality.
I feel sorry for any person that bought a '96 Infiniti I30.  It's exactly the same car as the Maxima, but much more expensive.

When the Maxima was redesigned again in 2000, I was horrified at what I saw.  It has completely lost its sex appeal, inside and out.  The outside is just plain ugly.  The front end looks swollen.  The front bumper, headlights, and grill are all molded into one large hump.  It reminds me of the big knot on my dad's bald head that he got when he hit his head on the kitchen cabinet door.  The rear end is just as ugly as the front.  You can't tell whether this car is coming or going.  What's with those tail lights!?  Inside, the interior looks a little cheaper in my opinion.  It seems like they used cheaper interior plastics this time around.  The interior just looks and feels cheaper than the previous Maxima.  I do love the seat fabrics though.  Nice leather!

When I first heard that the '93 Maxima SE had a 190hp 3.0L V-6, I was amazed.  190hp from a 3.0L V-6 was a lot of horsepower back then, and still is!  Now, the Maxima has 222hp from the same 3.0L V-6.  Wow!  It must really fly!

I'm guessing that the new 2000 Maxima will be a great car like the older Maximas, but I would not buy one just because they are so darn ugly!  Over $20,000 for that thing, no way.  I'll stick with a '93 Maxima! <br><br>
