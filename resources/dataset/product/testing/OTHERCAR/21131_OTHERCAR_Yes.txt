            So I went on Ebay and hocked a couple of my gizmos so I could go out and buy a new gizmo for my upcoming birthday.  I decided on the DSC-F505V because it was on sale at Circuit City, and quite frankly, I was tired of shopping around. :)

The F505V was Sony's high-end model a year ago.  It's now been replaced in that category by the F707, Sony's 5 megapixel version of this camera (larger physically and $1,000).  Here's my scoop on it:

<b>WHAT YOU GET</b>

You get of course the F505V camera, len's cap, wrist strap, video an image transfer cables (USB), an "info-lithium" battery, battery charger, and instruction manual. An 8 meg memory stick is included (BOOOOO) which will only allow for a few photos so go ahead and plan on the added cost of a 64 or 128 meg stick so you won't have to worry about how many photos you take.

<b>THE GOOD</b>

Nothing beats a good zoom lens.  Most digital cameras are still stuck in a 3X range, but the F505V gives you a good 5X optical zoom with a good wide-angle to zoom range on it (approx. 38-190mm).  With the 2X digital zoom turned on, you can get a 10X zoom - and Sony's digital zooms really do a fairly better job than most other manufacturers, so the image is not degraded too much when using the digital zoom like it does with other makers.  Once you use a 5X to 10X zoom you can never go back to 3X again.  The entire lens barrel is also hinged, so you can tilt it up, down, or straight ahead, to get hard shots that you can't get with a camera that simply aims "straight on".

The threaded lens barrel allows you to purchase off-the-shelf lens filters from any camera shop (52mm size) to attach to the front.  You should always keep a UV filter on the camera simply to protect the lens at all times, but I also suggest a polarized filter for use at the beach, lake, or near other water/metal/reflective shots.  Most digital cameras do not have actual threaded lens barrels, so this is a plus (to me, anyway).

The 505V is very easy to use.  The on-screen menus are easy to navigate and understand, though the manual can be a bit confusing at times.

External Flash Option:  With the optional flash unit, you can get up to 30 ft. of flash.  It's about $110 from Sony, but it does give you greater options than just the small built in flash unit.

Extras:  Black and white mode, Sepia mode, and more.  Spot metering for better exposures in extreme conditions.  White balance controls to brighten/darken photos.  A manual focus ring so you can focus yourself in odd conditions.  A pop-up flash that is pretty strong compared to other Sony cameras, that you can control the intensity of.  All of these are built in to the camera, and to top it off, the "info lithium" battery that will let you know exactly how many minutes of power you have left.

Photo Quality?  I rate it "good", or on a scale of 1-10, maybe a 7.5 to 8.  No, it's not the best, nor is it "bad" by any means.  On-screen images are typically very clear and bright, and have good color saturation.  In print however, they do require quite a bit of printer "tweaking" as I had to greatly darken the image and add a good bit of saturation to it in order for the printer to give me a good 8x10 shot - unlike my Olympus models that seem to print well "as they are" out of camera.

Movie modes:  You can shoot short video clips which of course, will never replace your camcorder at 15 second internals.  A gizmo add-on, but fun regardless.

<b>THE BAD</b>

If you have large hands, the tiny 3.5 x 2.5 inch body (approx.) will feel "cramped".  There's not a large or comfortable place to rest a larger thumb, and the zoom control switch is a little awkward to reach.  I find myself having to divert my eyes from time to time to see/find the zoom control or shutter button due to the diminutive size of the camera body.  FYI.. model 707 features a body that is about 30% larger than the 505V, good for larger hands (but again, $1,000).

Many makers today are adding "AF Assist" lights to their cameras - a small reddish light that emits from the camera in low-light conditions to help the auto-focus work correctly.  The 505V does NOT have this feature.  Indoor night shots may well turn out blurry.  Boo Sony. Though they say this newer 505V model does better indoors than the older 505 (no "V") model, I can't see how it could do worse.  In a room with 3, 60 watt lamps on, the camera was completely unable to focus on the subject I was aiming at.  No other camera I own is as bad as this one when it comes to low-light focusing.  While it take great shots outdoors, this fault alone means it's definately not the camera to take with you to a party or night time gathering.  You can however, use the manual focus in these situations, though it's more time consuming, causing you to miss those sudden photo opportunities.

The battery door feels a little flimsy, and you must open it to remove the memory stick too.  It would have been nice for the memory stick to have it's own access door (such as on the Sony P30 and P50 models) to reduce wear and tear on this one door.

No optical viewfinder.  You MUST use the color LCD display to compose your images.  It's harder to see in sunlight, so be ready.  Boo again Sony.

No image quality settings.  Many Sony cameras offer you the ability to choose "normal" or "fine" quality settings on the images, depending on their use (email, printing, etc.).  The F505V does NOT.  You're stuck with the default setting, which is probably closer to an "upper normal" than a really good "fine" setting.  You can also choose "TIFF", an uncompressed mode, but be aware that while it stores more image data, it takes 30 seconds to store each TIFF photo.

<b>THE BIG BOO BOO</b>

Newbies are easily confused.  Thank God I'm not a newbie to digital cameras.  Sony however, sells this camera basically as one that takes "3.7 megapixel, 2240 x 1680 pixel images".  This is untrue.  This is a 2.6 megapixel camera that takes "true" 1856 x 1392 pixel images.  It will "interpolate" images to the larger size, but this involves in-camera software that adds pixels to the image to make it larger.  This does degrade image quality since it is "faked" imaging and not a true 3.7 megapixel image.  Sony's interpolation is a little clearer than what some other camera makers use (when they use it) but regardless, be aware that this is a 2.6 megapixel camera, and not a 3+ megapixel unit, as many stores advertise it as.

<b>THE REST</b>

If you can find the F505V at a good price (under $650 as of 2/10/02) then go for it, if you want a great zoom, filter options, and good (though not perfect) images.  If you have huge hands, take tons of photos out doors in sunlight, and are very very picky about getting "perfect" 8x10 prints, then you should look elsewhere - the F505V may disappoint you.

Overall I'm glad I got the camera.  A few gripes and moans here, but the total package is "just fine", especially for the price I found it at.
