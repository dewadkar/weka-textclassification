            The 300M is a DREAM CAR...!

I have owned several four door sports sedans in the past. Just prior to the purchase of the 300M I owned the two door Chrysler Sebring Coupe.

The 300M with it's 250+hp engine is quick to pick up speed when entering the freeway....passing on country two lane roads...and just for fun!  I and my family reside in Colorado...NEVER a problem climbing up the several thousand feet in altitude from the valley floor into the mountains with the 300M.  Even with a full load of luggage and passengers for a long week end in our mountain resort home, we leave the slower traffic behind us!  I LOVE IT!

The room in the passenger compartment is FANTASTIC....!  My goodness, five adults can be comfortable on long trips.  I sometimes ride in the back seat with friends, while my wife drives...as we show off the mountains of Colorado.  Plenty of &quot;leg and elbow&quot; room for this tall frame of mine and my friend's.

Last yet NOT least, the styling...a SEXY KILLER looking automobile.  I have had strangers on the street, at stop lights roll down windows and ask &quot;what kind of car is that&quot;.  I was sitting in the 300M, waiting for my wife, a woman visitor at the ski resort just a week ago commented, &quot;this is the first car I have seen, that I like the front end and the back end styling...&quot;!!!  I do LOVE my 300M DREAM CAR!
