            Yeah, I have a 1992 Chevy Cavalier and I can't say I'd rather have another car! I've driven this car for 3 years already, my mother gave it to me when she bought another car. We bought this car new in 1992 and it's been going very strong ever since. In fact, I don't think there's been a day since the year 1992(9 years ago) that this car hasn't been driven. And never have we had any major problems with it. Well I guess only 1 big problem occurred, and that was when the head gasket blew. But we got that fixed, it cost 500 dollars but it was well worth it because ever since we got the head gasket fixed, which was 3 years ago, it's been running just like a new car! Also some little problems occurred and the cooling fan went, the water pump went, and also the alternator, but these only happened 1 time in the car's 9 years of existence, which isn't bad. Right now there's 172,000 miles on my 92 Cavalier and really all I do to keep this car running strong is change my engine oil every 3,000 miles and just simply check all the other engine fluids, which isn't a problem at all. Also I love driving this car because it's really easy to handle and its fairly small size makes it easy to zip around in, something a bigger car just couldn't do! Heck I've driven this car on country roads that have twists and turns in them like crazy, and I can still go at least 45 mph cause this car is small and zippy and easy to maneuver. Also, with a surprise, this car has awesome pick up. When you step on the gas this car goes and really doesn't get lazy, which kind of surprises me because it only has a 2.2 4 cylinder engine in it, which in a way performs more like a big V-6 or perhaps even a V-8 engine. The only time this 92 Cavalier is sluggish is when you go up a steep hill, I guess that's when you can tell there's a 4 cylinder engine under the hood. But this isn't too much of a problem at all because 95% of the time, this car has a lot of power in it and will get you anywhere. The interior is comfortable too, never does anyone get uncomfortable when riding in this car because there's cloth seats and also a lot of head room. I think my car actually has more head and leg room(and just overall more comfort) then my dad's Mercury Grand Marquis, believe it or not! Overall I love this 1992 Chevy Cavalier and it's by far the greatest car I've ever driven in or owned because like I said, it's small and zippy, and also has great gas mileage, and good engine power. I already have 172,000 miles on this car and it seems like it's gonna go for at least another 100,000!! Good car overall.
