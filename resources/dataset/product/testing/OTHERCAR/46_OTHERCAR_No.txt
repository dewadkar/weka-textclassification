            I bought my '98 4wd Isuzu Amigo as a new vehicle on Nov. 10, 1998. Shortly after purchasing it, I noticed it pulling to the right and a vibration problem felt in the truck and the steering wheel. At first, my dealer (Roger Burdick, N. Syracuse, NY) tried to tell me there was no problem, or that it had been fixed. Over and over, I would bring the truck to the dealer and have them try and fix it. My mechanic thought that it was a design problem with the newly released models, while my service advisor finally admitted to me that Isuzu new about the problem &quot;from day one.&quot;

After moving back to my hometown, I tried to get my new dealer to try and fix it. The day I brought it in for service, I happened to run into an engineer (Pat Reynolds) from Isuzu's legal department in California. He took it for a drive with me an agreed there was a vibration problem. He called it &quot;oscillation&quot; in the truck while the vibrations in the wheel were called &quot;nibble&quot;. He told me not to worry and that Isuzu &quot;stood behind its vehicles.&quot;

Mr. Reynolds had another engineer look at it, make recommendations to the mechanic, and then disappeared. He was supposed to come back to check the vehicle, but never did. After waiting four days, my service manager gave up and told me to come get the truck.

So, right now I'm going to arbitration next week (April 11). Isuzu IS NOT a company that stands behind its vehicles and you really should think about buying a different make of vehicle.

Please heed this advice. If you'd like some details on the nightmare Isuzu has put me through, check out my website. Good luck if you do decide to purchase your truck from Isuzu.
