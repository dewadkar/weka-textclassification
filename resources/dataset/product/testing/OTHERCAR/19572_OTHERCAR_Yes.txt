            Space: Very roomy, good for long road trips with the kids and dogs.  You can fit suitcases, golf bags, and a snowboard in the trunk without removing the third seat.

Fun: Lots of fun to fix up with after market products like a TV/VCR unit, billet grille, and nice wheels and tires.  Also nice for in car dinning. It has 10 cup holders, 2 of which can fit the McDonalds super size, &quot;tub o coke&quot;, drinks.  

Handling: What can I say, it drives like a luxury truck with good handling and high speeds.  It does great in the snow and even off roads, through the brush.  

With an automatic transfer case it pulls almost anything with a push of a button.

One of the only bad things about this car is that it is a gas waster.  It gets about 10 to 11 miles per gallon and with a 40 gallon gas tank it can hit your wallet hard when you go to fill it up.  Another bad feature is that there is no light to indicate when you are running low and need to fill it up.  I have run out of gas a few times because I haven't paid attention to the gas gauge.

All in all this car is the right car for you if you need lots of room and and you want to roll in style.  For some reason lots of young children and teenagers admire this car and would love for you to get one, I know mine do!<br><br>
