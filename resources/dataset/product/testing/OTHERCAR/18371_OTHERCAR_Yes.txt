            When I began car shopping about a year ago, I was sure I was going to be purchasing a Mitsubishi Eclipse.  With many manufacturers discontinuing their sport coupes in favor of trucks and sport utility models, where wasn�t much to choose from for those of us who like to drive back and forth to work with visions of race cars in our heads.

Then I discovered the Hyundai Tiburon.  It�s a beautiful car, with lots of artfully sculpted sheet metal, bulging fenders, and an aggressive stance that say �please drive me fast�. I went to the dealer for a test drive, and drove away with a new car three hours later.  Priced about $1,500 less than the Eclipse I had my eyes on, it was a great value.  I�ve been having loads of fun with it for the past year.

You�ll stand out from the crowd if you own a Tiburon: there are only about 9,000 of them in the entire United States.  I�ve had people speed up and drive beside me on the freeway just so they could get a closer look.

If you don�t like that kind of attention, you just need to put your foot down to get away. The Tiburon is geared for acceleration � it�s not difficult to get a burst of power even when running in 5th gear. The engine has an absolutely beautiful exhaust noise for those that like to imagine themselves at the wheel of a Porsche 962.  On the down side, I�ve found that the great acceleration comes at a price:  higher than usual RPMs at normal speeds, which translate into mediocre gas mileage for a car of this size.

The handling and braking of the car is excellent, and the ride is quite stable for a sport coupe.  The Tiburon takes bumps so well, that I had trouble getting a good seat-of-the-pants feel when I drove through corners quickly.  For a serious driver who likes to heel-and-toe downshift, the Tiburon�s pedal placement is horrible.  Only those with extremely huge feet will be able to reach the gas pedal to blip the throttle while braking.

The Tiburon�s transmission is an acquired taste.  I�ve found that it has to be warmed up in the morning; my first few gear changes have to be very light and delicate.  Anything else, and the car lurches to a crawl, almost as if it needs to wake up, yawn, and stretch for a bit before actually doing its work. After a few shifts, everything works fine. The shifter is somewhat notchy and is a far cry from the silky smooth transmissions that I�ve experienced with other sport coupes from Honda and Ford.  But, now that I�ve driven it for a year, it�s begun to grow on me.  The Tiburon rewards a light touch and smooth shifting and clutching, which is how a manual transmission should be driven anyway.  

The interior of the car is what really sold me:  the dashboard literally wraps around the driver, branching out to include a portion of the door.  Everything is within easy reach, including the heating and air-conditioning controls, which have huge knobs for easy adjustment.  The driver�s seat has a cockpit feel that adds to the racing feel of the Tiburon�s driving experience.  Even though there�s a back seat, I think this is basically a two-person car � the back seat is as small and impractical as any car I�ve ever ridden in.  With the rear seats folded down, I�ve been able to transport some large loads in the hatchback.

I�ve only had one trip to the dealer for a problem, but it was a scary one:  the engine power would randomly cut out for a second or two at high speeds.  The dealer replaced the engine control module, and the problem went away. 

I would recommend the Tiburon to anyone looking for economical fun.  The car was designed and tuned for a high-performance driving experience � which is something it delivers at a price thousands of dollars less than other similar models.  You might not be able to compete with a Mustang in a drag race, but you�ll have a lot of fun while you�re doing it.<br><br>
