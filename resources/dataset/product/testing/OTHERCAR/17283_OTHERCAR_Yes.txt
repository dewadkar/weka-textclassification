            This vehicle is in a class of its own. If you are a family on the go this is the ultimate family car. No other has the power or performance that this one shows time and time again. It will amaze you over and over at the things that you can accomplish with this all around vehicle. It is number one in my book and it's style and class will never fade away. It's design has been thoroughly thought out to provide you with whatever you may need in a vehicle. Whether it be for towing, hauling around the family, winter weather travel or just for the security of the size. I would recommend it even to an older person because it drives like a Cadillac.<br><br>
