               Yeah, I bought one. I'm glad I gave in to my wife, its all I used to hear when car shopping came around, Let's get a Saturn, so one day after work I say &quot;why not, lets go take a look.&quot; We called our local dealership and they invited us, not for a test drive, but to come down and enjoy the Bar-B-Que. I immediately thought &quot;ahh, another sales scam to draw them in like cattle.&quot; But we went anyway, it is free food.

   We got to the dealership and found a picnic style atmosphere of new Saturn owners. So we grabbed some napkins and put our guard up for the vultures. Finally they arrived, we prepared ourselves to say those nasty words &quot;yes, we're looking for a new car&quot;, but the reply from the sales staff member was very different then we were accustomed to hearing &quot;welcome, feel free to talk to our customers here, and look around for yourselves. I'll be here if you need me to answer any questions.&quot; First impressions of a car salesman, very important in my book.

   My wife and I explored the dealership and learned everything you need to know about the cars was clearly posted, either on the window sticker(for ACTUAL price and features)or saftey features and extras available in the showroom floor, on interactive boards which my baby girl thought to be very interesting as well. We were both tired of car shopping and it was nice to be in a pressure free environment.

   A brand new 2000 SL2 (AUTO Trans.)is the car that caught our eyes. We drove the car, and for a four cylinder i was even impressed. The features that came in our car were excellent also, it has power windows,locks, mirrors, cruise control, alarm, AM/FM CD and Cassette, Keyless entry system that we both love. My wife and I loved the car, for its features and especially the price, which i thought, after spending about a month or so of shopping was VERY reasonable.

   So we tell the sales guy &quot;yeah, we like this one, it drove pretty good&quot; trying not to let him know we liked it more than he knew. He replied with &quot;are you planing on trading in your vehicle?&quot; Yes we were, but we didn't think we'd get much for the sweet chariot that led us to Saturn. The sales staff came up with the idea of us taking the car out for a day or two on our own, while they found a prospective buyer for our automobile. So we were off, enjoying the car.

   The next day we arrive at the dealership. Our salesman had found a buyer that offered more then we had thought of getting for our automobile.
So we chose to buy the car. The process and paperwork were a breeze, I think it took us about forty-five min. We still couldn't believe the deal we got, and our monthly payment was well under $300.00, for us that was almost unheard of.

   We've had the car about three months now, and it's great. A real joy to drive. Now I see why there are so many on the road.

   Saturn really is &quot;A different kind of company.&quot; With Saturn there is no negotiation with there price, but you really get the actual price of the vehicle. I believe in my &quot;epinion&quot; the price is very reasonable.
