            I am on my second Chevy pick up.  This one I love and NEVER want to give it up.  It's a 91 stepside silverado.  I have never had any vehicle be as dependable at this one is.  It has a 350, automatic (700R4)the best tranny!! and 4-wheel drive and a posi rear end.  The area I live in is covered with hills and I have never had trouble getting out in the winter even when we had a bad one with over a foot of snow!!  The only problem with my particular truck is some kind of factory paint defect where the paint is lifting off the truck.  Seems to only be on the metal portions, since I have a step side the back is fiberglass and is unaffected.  I have over 100,000 miles on this truck and she runs strong.  I have never been left stranded and hope to get another 100,000 out of her!!!<br><br>
