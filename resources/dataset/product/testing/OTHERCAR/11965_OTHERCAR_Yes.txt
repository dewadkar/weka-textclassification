            The 96 Sunfire GT is the best entry level sporty coupe that can be bought for the money. It offers head-turning style, impressive performance, and reliability. Like a typical Pontiac, styling and performance are the car's forte. It is really a car built for drivers.

The styling is definitely attention grabbing, especially the GT's. The sleek and rakish profile is unmistakable, even from a distance. The GT comes with added styling cues such as dual exhausts, three-spoke alloy wheels and low-profile tires that can fool you into thinking its a muscle car if you're not careful. There are also round turning lamps in the front; they're so neat that Pontiac decided to use them for the SE models as well for 2000. Much of the styling has been adapted from the Firebird, making the Sunfire share a definite resemblance. That's better than I can say for the Cavalier, which looks nothing at all like the Camaro. I definitely recommend the Sunfire over the Cavalier in the looks department; the Cavalier just looks sedate compared to the aggressive looks of the Sunfire.

Performance-wise, the Sunfire GT is really a blast to drive. The 150 hp and 155 ft lb Twin Cam 2.4L engine is surprisingly powerful and torquey, giving the car a lot of zip, yet it is quiet and smooth (too quiet for my liking) and the fuel economy is still excellent. It also gives a nice Pontiac rumble; unfortunately it isn't very loud. 0-60 isn't all that's appealing to the Sunfire. The sport suspension and 205/55R16 Goodyear Eagle RS-A performance tires combine to give the Sunfire excellent handling and response. The engine and suspension setup makes driving a winding mountain road take on a new dimension of excitement. Unfortunately, the stiff GT sport suspension does exact a small price on ride comfort, as it makes poor road surfaces much more noticeable. Braking is excellent; it stops on a dime and the brake pedal gives good feedback.

While the Sunfire blows away its import and domestic competitors in styling and performance, it is no loser in the reliability department. After so long, I have had no major problems with it. The biggest issue I ever had with it was when a faulty fuel gauge stranded me by lack of fuel, but the car was still under warranty and the problem was fixed. Fit and finish is quite good, surprising for an American car, as there are very few squeaks and rattles, even though the road maintenance in my area is chronically underfunded. I've only had one recall performed on it, an airbag recall, which is just minor.

The only really annoying quality problem with the Sunfire is the transmission. My GT comes with the 4-speed auto, which has an annoying habit of shifting into gear late and very abruptly when Drive is selected and the car is fairly cold. This results in an unerving thump and the car tries to jerk forward. The auto is also not very smooth; I know it's not a Lexus, but it's not supposed to be that coarse.

Overall, the Sunfire GT is the car to go with when buying an entry level sporty coupe. Don't even think import, they're dead when it comes to styling and performance. The Sunfire even beats out North American competitors, even its twin from the Bow Tie division. The Sunfire GT is yet another example of the excitement coming from Pontiac<br><br>
