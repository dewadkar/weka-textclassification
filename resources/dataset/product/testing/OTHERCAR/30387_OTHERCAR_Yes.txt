Let me start by saying the Pontiac Aztek is definitely a car for the open-minded. If you are worried about the way it looks, maybe you should look elsewhere. However, if looks aren't that high on your list of things that are important, and you want something versatile, look in the direction of your nearest Pontiac dealer.

I had the oppurtunity to drive an Aztek and I was enthralled. It drove nicer than a minivan and felt as sporty as a car. The 3.4L V6 delivers adequate power and gets the car up to speed without question. It wouldn't be a bad move for Pontiac to possibly introduce a small V8 for this car in years to come, that would be quite nice for towing. The all-wheel-drive package that will be available in 2001 will be a great asset to this vehicle as well.

Now, let's talk versatility. Just in reading the brochure I was turned on to this vehicle. I am currently car shopping and were looking at two other vehicles similar to the Aztek. I won't mention names, but cargo space is a big thing on my list. One had up to 72.3 cu. ft., another had 88, but the Aztek boasts a whopping 93.5 cu. ft of cargo space with the rear seats taken out!! It may not look it from the outside, but looks can be deceiving. 

I also like the potential of choice in sound systems...I believe there are 4 different ones (maybe 3, maybe 5, pretty sure it's 4) so it appeals to the younger crowds to get the 10-speaker pioneer system...for those not interested in bassy audio, there are other choices.

I'd pick this car over any regular Sport Utility Vehicle - it's a lot more fun in both the way it looks and the way it behaves. If you're looking for serious off-roading fun, this isn't the car you want...but if you live somewhere where you get snow in the winter, pick up an All-wheel-Drive Aztek - it will get you places safely in the winter, while being a lot of fun all year round.

I hope you find this helpful...<br><br>
