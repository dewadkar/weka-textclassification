            This model should never be confused with the 2-door model.  The cars are very different.  The JLX Sport model is also different, having a wider wheel base for stability and more insulation for a quieter ride.

We bought a Suzuki Sidekick JLX Sport new in 1997 and have been driving it to this day.  When we first got it, it was our primary cars for trips, etc.  We have over 70,000 miles on it to this day. The car has been used to drive in the back roads of the Adirondacks to the abuses of New York City Area commuting.  Our other cars have been a Toyota, Integra, and Volvo, so keep in mind the quality that we compare it to.

The positives:
The car is awesome in the snow and the suspension is great off-road.  When 4-wheel drive is engaged, the car grips the road and drives through anything. 

The visibility in the car is great.  The cabin is very airy.  We test drove all the SUV's, many of which seemed very cramped.  The head room seems a lot better in the Suzuki and the front doors have large windows.

During Flood Floyd, this car traveled through the worst of storm.  We had to jump over curbs and go off road in the muddiest of soup to avoid the foulest of conditions and did it with ease.

The back seats fold down to make a good cargo area.

The car shifts well (we have a manual) and is very peppy.

The negatives:
The fronts seats are very smushy and on a trip greater than an hours, hip fatigue sets in.  

I have an dog the size of a Labrador, and he has trouble getting in the passenger doors.  He can get in the back door though.

We tried to get a sun roof, but were told it wasn't possible due to the contoured/rippled roof.

There have been a few repairs,,some under warranty, some not.  Things that have been fixed: fan clutch, brakes, fuel pump, fan belts.

When it rains, the droplets pound on the roof sounds like a tin can.  Driving/road noise is not too bad.

Paint integrity and interior finishes are not as good as my other cars.  But what do you expect for a car at that price.

In summary:
We take our rear wheel drive Volvo for all our longer trips, but if the weather is bad or we are going on back roads, we take the Suzuki.  We also take this car when a shopping spree demands a square large cargo area! For the price, this SUV worth what it costs.
