            I bought this car because I wanted a comfortable highway car.  I looked at the usual list of cars (4cyl Camry, accord, malibu, altima), but bought the Intrepid because of its price and style.  

I was skeptical at first, because of Chrysler's reliability history and having never owned an American car.

So far, the experience has been good.  I have 59000 km (37000 Miles) on my 98 base Intrepid. 

Here's the work I have done so far:

-oil change every 7k (4500 miles).
-Replace transmission fluid at 48000 km.  I don't know why it needs to be replaced so often.  Other cars or even other Chryslers aren't like this.
-Replaced driver's side power window motor at 40000 km.
-My passenger side window did not work for a day around 35000 km, but hasn't happened since.  Hope it doesn't happen again.
- My car would not start at 59000km.  I called Chrysler Roadside and had it towed to the dealer.  The problem turned out to be a corroded battery cable on the positive side.  I noticed that my battery was leaking some sort of fluid months before this.   Luckily, it happened before my warranty expired at 60k km.

Because my dealer was 50km away and Chrysler only pays up to 35km towing, I had to pay $44 CDN for the towing charges, which seems a bit cheap.


Pros:  The car is very comfortable, especially on the highway.  So far pretty cheap to maintain.  I have about 70% brake pad left on my front wheels.  Trunk space is big (no fold down seats though!!).  Nicely styled and handles reasonably well for a big car (i.e. doesn't feel like a floaty American boat).

Cons:  Difficult to park at first, due to size and can't see any corners of the car.  Using the side mirrors are a must.  Dealers service not very good compared to imports, imo.
The big low sloping hood gets many stone chips.   Brakes are a little weak.


Overall I like the car, though I did have a few minor problems.
I usually like to keep my car for long time, and would like to hear from people who have high mileages on the newer model Intrepid.
