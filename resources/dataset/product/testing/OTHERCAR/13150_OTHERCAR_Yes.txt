            I bought this camera a couple of weeks prior to a trip.  I have been looking for a couple of years for a step up from my older digital camera, and this is the closest any digital camera has come to my desired specifications at a reasonable price.

Pictures taken under all conditions were excellent.  I took pictures outside in sun and overcast, backlighted (using exposure compensation) and in glare (with a polarizing filter).  The annoying extension tube required for filters and auxiliary lenses does not result in shadowing at the corners, as I had feared it might.  I took pictures inside with flash and in available light.  The focus was reliable, even in relatively low light, and exposure was usually dead on.

This camera allows great control of automatic features.  Each aspect can be adjusted or set manually, including full manual operation.  Your preferred settings can be saved and recalled automatically in "my mode."

Most functions and settings are available both from a "tree" menu, or with fast access buttons.  It's a little intimidating at first, but logical and easy to get used to.

The automatic flash fires too often for my taste, washing out detail and further slowing the already slow shutter.  That doesn't seem to be adjustable, and I now keep the flash on manual.

The camera doesn't break new ground in styling, but it is intuitive, and controls line up with your hand without particular thought on the part of the photographer.

The included 32Mb card holds only 7 pictures at minimum jpg compression.  I bought a 1Gb micro drive (260  pictures at same resolution) which the camera recognized and formatted flawlessly.

The USB connection seems to be 1.1, rather than 2.0.  Even so, the speed of transferring even large images to the computer is satisfactory.

Other advantages include:

Images seem to be sharp edge to edge

Logical and convenient access to functions

Diopter adjustment for use without glasses

Macro focus without adapter

Slots for both smart media and compact flash simultaneously

5 megapixels allows large prints

Comes with rechargeable AA batteries - uses any AA batteries in an emergency

Good range of shutter speeds

Tilting lcd display

Other disadvantages:

lcd display is hard to see under many lighting conditions

Filter and accessory lenses require an awkward extension adapter.  The larger diameter of the adapter means you need two lens caps.  This wouldn't have happened before Dr. Maitani retired.

I have found that good design and bad design both manifest themselves with increasing intensity.  As you use a well designed product, you continue to discover conveniences you hadn&#146t known were there, enhancing your enjoyment and satisfaction.  Poorly designed products, over time, continually find new ways to aggravate and annoy you.  This camera shows all of the early indications of good design (as did my earlier Olympus cameras).  I like it better every time I use it.


Probably not right for those who don't want to be bothered thinking about the picture taking process.
