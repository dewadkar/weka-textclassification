            It was October, 2002, and it had been 6 months since my 1995 Honda Accord EX Sedan had been stolen.  Enough was enough,  I needed a car before the rough winter started.  I travelled <i>(by public transportation)</i> to my local Honda dealer, and began to shop around.  I've owned 3 Honda's in the past, so I decided to stay with the brand that has almost never let me down.

When I walked in to Plaza Honda, in Brooklyn, NY,  I noticed the brochures for the newly designed 2003 Honda Accord Sedan & Coupe.  The new sedan didn't appeal to me, but the new coupe looked outstanding.  Gazing upon the prices, I realized it was a little out of my league.  I realized I had to go used.

I noticed a 1998 Honda Accord Coupe in red.  The car was in mint condition, but stickered about $2000 out of my range.  I walked over to the next vehicle, and it is the one I own today.  A mint white 1999 Honda Accord LX Sedan, with only 50,000 miles.

Only 50,000 miles on a 1999 Accord is a real find.  I took it for a spin with the salesman, he even let me bring it on the highway.  The ride was smooth, even on uneven pavement.  I noticed the car came with only an AM/FM Cassette player.  That was soon to change.  The dash had nice easy to read gauges, & large red dials.

I have some gripes with the standard features of the LX.  No car manufactured after 1995 should come without a CD player.  Who's listened to cassettes in the past 10 years?  Not anyone I know.  I also would have liked to have some alloy wheels on my car, but the only Accord EX's available were V6's, a little out of my price range.  I guess I'll have to buy some rims pretty soon.

The four speed auto tranny shifts smoothly, even on hills.  I like to mash the gas pedal when taking off from a green light, and the tranny never slips even on those quick shifts right thru 80mph.  I've yet to have any mechanical problems, despite the harsh way I drive my car.

Back to the dealership,  the car was stickered at $13,900.  Knowing many people in this particular Honda dealer,  I knew I could get this price knocked down, despite the fact that I was financing this vehicle.  I met up with my friend, the service manager, and was able to get the car down to $11,100.  We put all the paperwork through, added the car to my insurance policy, and the next day I was on my way.  A very simple car buying experience.

It's 4 months now, and I have no known mechanical issues with this Accord yet.  I get my oil changed every 2,500 miles, and always get all my fluids checked regularly.  No leaks, no squeaks, I acutally purchased a used car that wasn't somebody elses headache!

Since purchasing the car, I have put about 21,000 miles on it.  The ride on the highway is superb, even driving on these rough New York City roads.  The ride on the street is likewise, the brakes are magnificent, and I've yet to feel a shimmy in my steering wheel, even when mashing the brake pedal.  Over rough pavement or a dip in the road,  you may feel a bump or two, but nothing major at all.

Sitting in front in the driver's or passenger's seat, there is plenty of leg and headroom (no sunroof).  There is a center armrest over the console, nice spot for my elbow.  The backseat can get a little cramped, if you are seating more than 2 adults.  But 3 or even 4 small children should fit back there without a problem.  Trunk space is more than adequate, 3 large suitcases should be able to fit in there, without squishing.  This is a big little car.

All in all, my Accord does for me what it does for almost everyone else that owns one.  It gets me around, safely, quietly, and quickly, and keeps on doing it day after day without coming out of my pocket.
