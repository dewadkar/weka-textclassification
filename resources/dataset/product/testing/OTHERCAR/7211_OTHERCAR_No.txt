            I still love my kitty and have written two reviews previous to this one.  However, I have four problems now and I am starting to be concerned.

My 99 Cougar 6 cyl. has 21,000 miles on it now.

First-

I am not a happy camper.  The city I live in, which boasts a population of over 38,000 people has lost it's Mercury Dealer.  This has left me with a drive of over 45 miles to my nearest dealer for any repairs or maintenance.  I am not happy about this, nor was I given any notice from Mercury.  I found out after a recent recall on the brakes.  

Second-

Shortly after this recall repair being done on my kitty, I noticed the back seat was making a noise.  Rarely does anyone sit in my back seat.  I looked and found a plastic clamp that holds the seat to the frame had been broken.  How this happened, I do not know.  Interesting though, as now you can see underneath the car from the inside.  I have always wanted to do that.  ;-)  Now I am forced to drive 45 miles to have this looked at, a part ordered and then drive back when the part is in and wait for it to be repaired.  Not happy again.

Third-

Now for the biggest concern I have.  This has to do with a noise I am hearing from the front end.  I think I have finally figured it out.

I think it has something to do with my idle.  I noticed last evening when I heard this noise, my tach was idling at 2,000 rpm.  A normal idle for me is a little under 1,000 rpm.  I cannot describe the noise, except it sounds like something is stuck.  Almost like a belt but without the squealing sound.

Previous to this I thought it had something to do with the brakes.  I am always braking when I hear this noise.  Last night, I happened to be braking at a very icy intersection and my car did not want to stop.  I looked at the tach and realized why.  Be careful out there!  I did go a little farther then I wanted to at this intersection.

This usually happens in cold weather and it has been extremely cold here in the last few days.  Average daytime temperatures have been 15 degrees.  The first time I heard this noise was last year, again extremely cold.  I did not hear it again until recently.  I thought it was gone.  Now it is happening more frequently and I will have to get this checked out during my next 45 mile drive ONE WAY to the dealer.

Fourth-

Always knocking when on interstate.  I have done everything to correct this.  The timing, the best gas (all grades) and had this repeatedly checked out. This car only knocks when at speeds of 60 mph or higher.  I noticed this during the summer on frequent trips on the interstate.  I do not hear it any other time and trying to convince the dealership of this is impossible.  I guess they are not taking it out on the interstate.  Any slight pressure on the accelerator and it starts knocking.  

Other than that I still like this car but I am starting to look around for something else.  It hasn't been doing very well with the wide tires on the ice lately.  Feeling like I might be ready for a more conservative change.  It might be a good idea considering some of the problems I have been experiencing and the fact that the nearest dealer is 45 MILES ONE WAY.  Oh yeah, I mentioned that didn't I.

If anyone else has any similar problems to mine, please let me know.  Perhaps I can give some advice to the dealer to help fix these items.  You know the one that is 45 miles ONE WAY.
