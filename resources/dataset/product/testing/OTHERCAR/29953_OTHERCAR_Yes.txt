            One of the most well known and best selling minivans of all time, the Caravan is a perfect family vehicle. The 2000 Caravan includes a 4 cylinder, front wheel drive, 2.4 L (148 cid) multipoint fuel injection and 3 speed automatic transmission. The Caravan gets about 17 to 23 miles per gallon in the city and 22 to 30 miles per gallon on the highway. 

The initial feeling when I first sat in the drivers seat is how comfortable the bucket seat is and how high and upright you are. The visibility is really nice with no major blind spots. The Caravan can seat 7 people comfortably with 2 front bucket seats, a middle bench which can seat 2 adults and rear bench which can seat 3 adults. The Caravan includes many storage areas including a cargo net (between 2 front bucket seats), lockable storage drawer (under the front passenger side bucket seat), silencer (at the rear floor), grocery bag hooks (at rear seat back) and side storage areas for other storage needs plus many cup holders. 

The Caravan's standard equipment includes next generation air bags, side impact protection (door beams), height adjustable shoulder belts (front and second row), head restraint (outboard seating), variable intermittent windshield wipers (one of my favorite features), rear window wiper/washer, power rack and pinion steering, compact spare tire, easy out roller seats (it really is easy to move/take out/put in), AM/FM cassette stereo with 4 speakers, power outlets (front and rear / 12 volt DC), tinted glass, fold away side mirrors, all season tires and side accent color molding. 

The Caravan's optional equipment (already installed / additional charge) includes air conditioning, sunscreen glass, windshield wiper de-icer, defroster (rear window) and California conformance emissions. I personally think the optional equipment should be part of the standard equipment.
