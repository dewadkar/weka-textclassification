            I purchased this truck to replace my 1986 Toyota 2WD pick-up, which was still running as good as ever, I just got fed up with the lousy bench seat, which offered very little lower back support.   Compared to my Toyota, the Nissan has weaker acceleration, but a much smoother suspension and ride.  It is very difficult to find a new Toyota 2WD truck at all, and nearly impossible to find one with a specific set of options, if you are fussy about those things.  Even if you could find a Toyota 2WD configured to your likings, it would be approximately $2,000 more than a similarly configured Nissan.  Nissan has a good selection of 2WDs available.  

  This truck is very comfortable for long trips, especially with the bucket seats.  The over the rail bedliner is a great addition.  Gas mileage has been a bit of a disappointment, it's rated 22 city/26 highway but I seem to get 22-23 no matter where I'm driving.  I bought this truck with hopes of putting my kids in the rear jump seats, but I've learned that's not a good idea and should be avoided as much as possible because the seats face sideways, with no cushioning on the back of the cab.  As a result, they bang their heads at stop signs and even during gear shifting.  In the event of a crash, their heads and necks would be very vulnerable.  This probably applies to all extra-cab trucks with sideways facing rear seats. <br><br>
