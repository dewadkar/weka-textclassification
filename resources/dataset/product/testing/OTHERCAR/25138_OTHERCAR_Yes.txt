            I bought the Canon Powershot S110 camera for many reasons after some very extensive research. At the end of my research I went to a local electronics store just to put my hands on some of the choices that I have narrowed down to. All were nice, but one thing stood out with the Canon Powershot S110 was the quality of the camera. The shell is made from stainless steal while all of the other cameras were plastic. All of the controls felt good and felt well made. On this observation alone, I made my decision. What helped me finalize my decision was the fact that the reviews for the Canon Powershot S110 were very good. I was able to catch some sample photos online which were absolutely beautiful. I found the best price online and made the purchase from Beach Camera. Beach Camera not only had the best price but they were also an authorized Canon dealer (I verified this with a phone call to Canon)

I bought this Camera for myself, as a Christmas 2001 gift. When it arrived, I opened the box and pulled everything out. The package includes: camera, battery, USB transfer cable, AV cable, 8mb compact flash card, 1 year full warranty, hand strap. The specs are impressive for such a small camera (about the size of a deck of cards)and too many to list here. Go to http://www.powershot.com/powershot2/s110/specs.html

The pictures that I have taken are sharp and clear. I have the resolution set as far as it can go at 1600 x 1200 fine. Each image takes up about 1mb of space on the compact flash card at the 1600 x 1200 resolution. I like compact flash because it is SO durable, small, inexpensive and easy to find.

The camera can also take digital videos. The format is AVI with the length of the compact flash card and file resolution that you set.

I am very happy with the Canon S110 and plan on using it for at least the next 3 to 4 years (I am a techno nut so I will probably want a new one by then)
