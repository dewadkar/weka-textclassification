            It all began with a trip to Florida. We flew down expecting to get a mid-size car from our Car Rental company. Well, when my father came back and told us he got a Chevy Prizm, my mouth dropped open and I couldn't believe they had given us, what I consider (and what actually fit into a spot for...) a compact! 

We walked out and got it. We each got in and took a look around . To start with, the seats are very uncomfortable, and the head rests are tilted at too strong of an angle. We took it out of the parking lot, and started on US41, we were trying to catch up to other drivers, but the engine didn't have any real "umph" to it. Nothing to push it forward. There's no way around this, it's really lacking horsepower.

Now, we're in Florida, and so it's very hot, as you'd expect. So, we turn u the air conditioning. We have everything set for it to get very cold, but it only gets medioceraly (if that's a word even) cool. Even with the AC on full blast it felt like it was blowing warm air, while we got into our friends Buick Century and it was blowing very cold air very fast! 

The suspension on the car seemed to be shot, you felt every bump you took, and you felt it hard. Also, it was a very noisy car. You hear the engine rumble, you heard the cars pass by you when they drove by, and you heard everything you'd drive over with an echo, it really wasn't a pleasant experience.

Even its look isn't very appealing. Although it somewhat resembles the Toyota Corolla, the Corolla is sportier and a much more reliable car.

I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone, and if you ever get this car put on you as a rental (even if it only has 6000 miles on it, like ours) pay the money to upgrade your car!
