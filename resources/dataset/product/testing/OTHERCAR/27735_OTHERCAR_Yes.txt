            This is the only thing I can think of, because I'd love to give this person a HUGE slap on the back for a job well done. .. 

For the longest time, I was searching for a digital camera that was actually portable. In portable, I mean something that you can take anywhere with you, and not have to worry about carrying the damn thing on a neck strap, like an SLR camera. Given that this is a review of the S100, I will try my best to give the most objective viewpoint I can.... 

Before this camera, I had an Olympus D-360R (check my review), which was very nice... the size was about the same as a cheap 35mm fixed focus camera, and the pictures the 1.3 megapixel CCD took were very well balanced. However, in lieu of the latest and greatest 3+ megapixel monsters, I figured it was time to move on... Here's the interesting part... Was there anything on the market that had a high pixel count, and wasn't the size of an Olympus-2020, or a Nikon Coolpix 900 series, etc...?  Yes, and no.

The Canon S100 is miniscule in size, which is first and foremost, it's most eye-catching, camera-selling, whoop-dee-dooing feature. It literally has the footprint of a credit card (LITERALLY!!!), and a depth of about 2 packs of playing cards... The camera has a 2.1 megapixel resolution, giving file sizes that range up to a little over a meg. However, this camera has a few downsides, although not as important to me, may possibly be important to others. 

First off, I wish there was a little LCD counter on the top of the camera to let you know how many shots  were left, flash options, battery life, etc... (like the olympus D-360R) It's too bad that the camera relies on the LCD solely for all the information that must be displayed to the user... This really sucks, since the LCD is the most power-sucking, battery draining bastard of the entire camera. 

Another gripe I have is the slightly soft focusing of the camera. Although the pictures really come out nicely, and color balance is very good, (although a bit underexposed) I never got this camera to take professional shots. If I did, I'd get a Nikon, or a Kodak. If you're a real stickler for focus, you could also take the images that you like the best, and go into a photo editing program like photodeluxe or photoshop(my fav), and apply a slight sharpening filter without much artifacting. The main reason I got this camera because of it's size, since a great camera that you never take pictures with is totally useless. 

That's about all I have to say about this camera. There are many reviews you can look at, and most importantly, PLAY with this camera before you buy it. I have a friend who already has one, and that was the deciding factor for me, since he explained all the functions of the camera, and I could see pictures that I took with that camera immediately. If you're really hung up on super high resolution, and razor-sharp focus, this really isn't the camera for you. However, if you're like me, and love to take a camera along w/you  for a special occasion, or just a regular ol' outing, this camera is perfect as it slips in your pocket with hardly a bulge showing through.
