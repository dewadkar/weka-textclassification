            I own a '91 Honda Accord that runs superbly.  Honda's are one of the longest lasting cars, and it has been proven to me.  My car has over 125 thousand miles on it already, and it runs perfectly.  One of the best advantages of this smaller car is the handling. The accord has great handling around corners and is very easy to drive.  The gas mileage is also a plus.  My accord averages about 30 miles to the gallon, which saves a good deal of money in gas.  For families this would be an idea car.  The accord if very roomy, but comfortable.  Also, the trunk is very large, and can fit almost anything in. 
After buying a Honda there is no other brand of car I would buy.  <br><br>
