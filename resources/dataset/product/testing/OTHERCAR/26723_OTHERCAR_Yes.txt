            If you are a casual camera user, this is for you!  If you are a photographer by nature and insist on the right zoom, the right lighting, etc., this may not be for you.

I use cameras for snap shots of friends, scenery, etc.  This camera does the trick.  

HERE'S THE GOOD STUFF:
-Fairly easy to use.  After about 10 snapshots you will know how the camera works.
-Inexpensive.  As far as digital cameras are concerned, this one is cheap.
-Good quality.  I used the camera to take some scenery shots on vacation in Hawaii.  The picture came out really nice...don't know what the marginal difference would be from a more expensive camera.

HERE'S THE BAD STUFF:
-Poor zoom.  You can zoom 2x, but that's it.
-Battery life.  It's not bad, but there are a couple annoying things.  When the battery runs low, you can no longer use the LCD screen for pictures.  You basically have to use the LCD screen for zoomed 2x pictures, so you can't zoom on your last 15 pictures or so before the batteries run out.

Again, this camera is a great deal if you like to take pictures of the fam and friends.  But if you insist on perfection in your pictures, you might want to look up the scale a bit further.
