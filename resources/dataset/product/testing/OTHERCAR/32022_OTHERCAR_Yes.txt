            I have owned my 2500HD LT 4x4 S/B crewcab for about two months now and am very pleased with it. Initially I was a little skeptical about such a big truck when I drive 1/2 city, 1/2 country but like most things in 5 minutes you've got the hang of it. The standard 6.0L engine is rated at 300 hp w/ 350lb/ft for torque. This is an incredibly quiet engine when you want it to be and snarls at the right time as well. I went with the LT version which pretty well loads it up. (Leather, full pwr seats w/ heat in both front seats, Onstar communications link, etc, etc) I haven't had any problems with the truck yet at all. When I was looking I compared it to Ford, Toyota, & Dodge but they were nowhere near as comfortable.
Negatives - When I was narrowing it down to the finer points I noticed that if I had bought a GMC version I would be able to get the larger 265 tire, but since I wanted the Chevy the max tire size could only be 245, and then when it came in they were Firestones! I know that not all their tires were flawed but the name gives me the willies everytime I take a corner too fast (everyday) also the plastic console lid has its good/bad points but overall I would more appreciate a flat, soft area (for a laptop). I won't get into a mileage comment at this time (it's not good so far) because it is still breaking in and getting better with every tank (90L/450km) (Iam Canadian) and I drive it fairly hard most of the time. Maybe it's a good thing that the engine cuts out at 160km/h (100mph) I will update later.
