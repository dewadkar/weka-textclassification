            After 3 months of research looking for a digital camera to take on vacation, I selected the Epson PhotoPC 850Z because it had the most bang for the buck.  I was pleasantly surprised with it.  I've gotten so many compliments on my pictures, which never happened with my film camera pictures.  I'd never owned a digital camera before this, and it had a wonderful out-of-the-box experience.  Just stick the batteries in and go to town!  The manuals are clear and easy to understand, as is the operation of the camera itself.  You get all the necessary cables and software to download pictures to you computer.  I've used it with both a PC and a Mac, and like the PC version better although there is not much difference.  I would suggest that anyone purchasing this camera also buy an extra memory card, because they will be taking pictures for the sheer enjoyment of it after seeing what this camera can do.  I liked my camera so much that when my boss asked me to buy one for work, I got another Epson PhotoPC 850Z.  Everyone at work fights over who gets to use (play with) it!

It's great for indoor and outdoor pictures, moving or still, and is perfect for taking pictures to post on a web site.  Quality is excellent!<br><br>
