            Hi, my name is Kristy and I own a 99' Prelude, and let me tell you some interesting facts.  I recently got into a car wreck with it, but you know what.  The 99' Prelude is so great and strong, that I wasn't badly hurt. I thank God, but the most important thing about the Prelude, is that it had both the safety and looks like a cool car needs.  Also, most of my family members own Honda's and they are so reliable.  I have a friend that has the same year as my Mom's Honda.  Her car is a Ford, and she had to go out and spend so much money fixing her car and stuff.  My mom has not yet spent a single dime on fixes except oil change and stuff like that. The Prelude is kind of expensive, but its worth it.  You can also do something unique with the Prelude.  If your one of those people who always wanted to drive manual but really cant, all you have to do is hit a button in the Prelude, and it changes to manual. Although its not really manual, you still feel like it.  And the best thing is, it saves you gas! Well, I hope all you guys out there find the car you like,  I know mines a HONDA PRELUDE!<br><br>
