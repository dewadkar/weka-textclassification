            The HPC20 is an inexpensive (by digital camera standards) camera that packs high features into an entry level product.  My wife and I bought this camera almost solely for it's low price.  The camera is easy to use, takes adequate pictures, and can transfer your images directly to your computer with little hassle.  The picture quality is good, although if you like to print your pictures, you will want to research this choice more thoroughly.  The operation of the camera is straight-forward and easy to use once you've read the manual once or twice.  Like most digital cameras, this baby eats batteries.  I mean it eats batteries.  This is not a practical camera for extended sightseeing. Do yourself a favor and invest in a battery charger and several sets of rechargeables; they will pay for themselves in no time.  I found that a set of four AA batteries will last for about 30 photos.  You will also want to get an external AC adapter to power the camera while you are downloading your photos to your machine.  This is a good camera if you don't want to spend a lot, but keep in mind that every bargain comes at a price.  Is this the right camera for you?  Only you can make that decision, if you want a camera for your personal web work and for the occasional event photograph, this is a good choice.  If you are looking for more, you may be disappointed.<br><br>
