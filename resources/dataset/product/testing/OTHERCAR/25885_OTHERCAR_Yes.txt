            Bought my 1986 Jeep Cherokee used. It had the factory lift with an additional lift for the 31.5 R15 tires.  The poor best had 150,000 miles at the time.  Since then I have increased that too 215,000 miles and it is still running.  

The only problems I have had with it are the wiring-- which was not a problem until a thief decided to cut my alpine stereo out of it literally and cut every wire in site trying to get it out. unfortunately they were successful at getting the radio and heater and air conditioning wires.  Another problem was when I woke up one morning and someone had used there car to drag my jeep down the street by the door jam.  really sucks cause I had just changed my insurance and the damage was not covered.  Last problem is that since I recently moved to arizona I am unable to register the vehicle in the county cause it will not pass emissions.  So it just cost more to get that taken care of.

Oh well I still love my Jeep It gets me were I want to go when I need to go.<br><br>
