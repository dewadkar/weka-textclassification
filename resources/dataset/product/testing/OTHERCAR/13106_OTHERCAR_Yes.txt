            By now, everyone has heard the great things about the car and they are all true.  I've had my car for almost 10 months and love it.  People can't believe its a Honda.  

For those of you who are thinking of this car, just a few things that you should know....  First, there is a lot of trunk space, however, its hard to lift things into it.  Also, even if you make it over, sometimes its hard to get an item into the trunk.  Take a look at the Sedan, it has a low back so its much easier to get things in and out of the trunk.  This will only be a problem if you use the trunk on a regular basis and are loading/unloading suitcases, boxes, etc. Another thing is the climate control.  Maybe I'm not using it correctly, but there are times when it is cold outside but sunny ( I live in the midwest).  I have to crank it to 80+ to get the heat to come on rather than than the a/c.  Last, it is difficult to get in and out of the back seat, but once your in there is a lot of room!
