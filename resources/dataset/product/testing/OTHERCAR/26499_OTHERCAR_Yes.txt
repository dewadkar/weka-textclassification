            Recently I bought a new Chevy S-10 Extended Cab Pickup Truck.  
We decided it was time to make this purchase based on these things: 

1. I found that the things I needed to fix on my Ford Ranger Pickup were going to cost about $2000. before it would pass inspection.  They were minor things, but costly.  New tires, a new windshield, a brake job, and new shocks.

2.  It was too small for our family to go anywhere together in.

3.  It had a smaller engine and we were afraid we were straining the motor every time we hauled our boat or pop-up camper with it.

SO, we went down to look at different pickup trucks.  A local dealership sent us a coupon in the mail, so they were one of the places that we went.

We were torn between a new Extended Cab Ford Ranger, and the Extended Cab Chevy S-10.  When it all came down to it, the Chevy dealership found the financing for us and the Ford dealership couldn't.

We brought the new truck home, and had it over the weekend.  By this point, we had already mounted my toolbox to the truck so it wouldn't be stolen.  They told us that the financing had been approved. We thought that the truck was ours.  

A couple of days later, we got a call from the dealership, and they told us that they had additional papers for us to sign, we went there and found out that the original deal wasn't going to fly with the creditors, and that it was going to cost $510. a month.  They made a big deal over the fact that it was ONLY going to cost about 100 dollars more a month than our present loan payment, which was $298.00.  

We liked the truck, but didn't like the finance package.  We had already mounted the toolbox so if we took our old truck back we would have to pay them to make the repair. Also, while driving the new truck home, the toolbox scratched the bed of the truck, so it would have to be repainted as well.  We figured we were out 1500 bucks and the space of the new truck if we didn't just take the truck. Don't let this happen to you!

We like the truck, but are very aggravated at the dealership's finance department for lying to us on the original contract.  

Here are some of the things that we like about our new truck.

1.  Extra room for carrying things for work, or to take the family somewhere.  This truck has a little seat in the back that folds out for a kid to ride in.  This isn't a full extended cab, the seat in the back doesn't face the front of the truck, it faces the driver's side door.  It has three doors - two full, and one half door.

2.  This truck has a bigger engine than my old truck.  The one I got has a V-8 engine, my old one had a 3.0 liter one. It eats more gas, but I know that I'm not straining the engine.  It has great pickup entering freeways as well.  

3.  It came with extra spiffies!  My old truck was just your basic truck.
It had an engine, wheels, seats, a/c and a radio.  This one came with a lot of neat stuff.  I had a choice between a basic truck without cruise control, and a deluxe package that came with cruise control.  The price difference was only $2000. so I took the deluxe package.
In it was a cd-player/tape deck, electric windows, an alarm package, remote control locks, and cruise control.  It also had the better air conditioner, and had an automatic transmission.  My old truck was a standard.

All in all, although I'm generally a Ford person, I find that I now own two Chevy's.  Come on Ford, get with the program.  Chevy is actually competing with you.
