            As a relatively average consumer, without any mechanical experience, knowledge or inclination, I bought the Toyota Tacoma based on looks and reputation.  It lives up to both.

I think it has the most striking profile of all the mid-size pick-ups made in past years.  In my opinion, only the recent Dodge Durango competes with the Tacoma in sex appeal.

Functionally speaking, the Tacoma is fantastic.  I didn't purchase the vehicle for its towing capacity, so I only got a four cylinder.  Living in mountainous terrain (Denver, CO), I often long for a more aggressive and powerful engine.  At those points, I just pop the stick into third and the truck responds to my wish.  As might be expected, this is accompanied by a droning noise.  The factory sound system could be a bit more robust to my liking to help combat this.  The four cylinder engine rewards me with consistent gas mileage of approximately 23 mpg.

The ride, when compared to a car, is true pick-up truck.  However, it's not overly fierce or bouncy.  I traded in a Toyota Celica and immediately noticed the differences (turning radius, ride feel, center of balance, etc.) as would be expected.

Driving comfort is good.  The overall design of the cockpit puts everything within easy reach and extended trips don't leave you feeling fatigued.  The glove compartment could afford to be a bit deeper though.

The Tacoma is an extremely functional and dependable vehicle.  It boasts the security and reliability of the Toyota name and holds its value amazingly well.  All things being relatively equal, buy this vehicle rather than its competition for the future it promise you.  <br><br>
