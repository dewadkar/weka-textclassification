            I bought a used 1999 Toyota Tacoma Ext Cab 4x4 SR5 with the TRD package 
in September of 1999 wit 10,000 miles. This is my first import truck 
in the past I have always owned GM products. WOW what a great truck so
far.I have put approx. 6,000 miles on it so far and it has been trouble 
free.The V6 and five speed really work well together although I would like better fuel mileage I have averaged around 19 MPG and have got as high as 22 MPG also a low or 14 MPG. As a professional mechanic (heavy trucks) I 
can honestly say that Toyota seems to have very high quality The only
additions so far have been a set of Huskey floor liners and a shell
for the bed. I have every intention of keeping this truck for at least 10 years.I priced new units and happened to find a 99 used one that was 5,000
 cheaper than new so that was enough savings to justify purchasing a used 
truck. Off Raod it will go through anything I attempt although I must admit I am not a hardcore off road driver lets face it i plan on driving this thing to work for at least 10 years. :)<br><br>
