            I bought a new 1500 SLT Dodge Quad Cab in August and absolutely love it.  I am especially pleased with its comfort and its ride.  It is easier to handle that I thought it would be, although parking at the mall can sometimes be a challenge.  You can also see other traffic due to its large mirrors and lack of blind spots.  Its gas mileage is about 15 mpg in town and 19 mpg on the highway.  The 5.2L standard engine is more than adequate and seems to be a good choice.  The four doors make it easy to load and unload the kids or groceries.  Overall, I am very pleased and would definitely recommend buying it.<br><br>
