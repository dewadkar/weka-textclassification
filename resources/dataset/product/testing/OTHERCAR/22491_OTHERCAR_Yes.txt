            I'm Saturn's target market for the mid-size car. 31, married, child. Owner of a couple of SL2s. Need a bigger car.

I'm happy to say, that if I'm the market Saturn wanted, then they did a nice job offering what I need. I have been ready for a couple of years to get out of my SL2--a nice little car, but definitely little, and the seats were murder on my wife's back. We went out looking for either a mid-size wagon, like the Subaru Legacy (but without all the useless "Outback" crud that jacks up the price), or a mini-van like the Mazda MP3, Toyota Sienna, or Dodge caravan. We also looked at Ford Escapes, Toyota Rav-4s, and Hyundai Santa Fes. In other words, we wanted a somewhat larger vehicle, good in snow (we spend a lot of the winter at our in-laws in the snowier parts of New England). We drove probably 12 different vehicles in all, and had basically settled on a stripped-down Mazda MP3 as the car of choice, when a newcomer entered the fray--the Saturn.

Saturn doesn't negotiate on price, so we had more or less ruled out the LW series a while ago, because at a sticker price around $20,000 (before tax, title, etc.) we knew it was just a little out of our target price range of $18-19. This summer being Saturn's 10th anniversary, they offered something unusual--0.9% financing, that even mere mortals like me could qualify for. This resulted (compared to the 6.5% my credit union was offering) in about a net $3000 savings off the sticker price, and put the Saturn back in our price range.

And thank heaven, because we got a car with all the power features you could want, a spacious interior, and still a small enough size that it doesn't frighten me to drive it (like a couple of the cars did!). The European styling (it started life as an Opel Vectra in Europe) are a nice look, and the interior is pretty well thought out. Some nice features: the computer monitors driving habits, and recommends when it's time for an oil change, so no more 3,000 miles to be safe. The engine has a "distributorless system" and so the sparks are good for an expected 100,000 miles, with no wires to change. The transmission shifts smoothly and more or less where I want it to shift. The AC cuts out automatically if you are trying to accelerate rapidly (as at a highway on-ramp).

The ride and seats are not ideal, but they are pretty good. (Minivan captain's chairs are what I consider "ideal"). The ride occasionally is a little stiff, but still much better than the Caravan, and comparable to the newer Legacies. We've had great experiences with Saturn on service in the past (one car had a bunch of problems, but they took good care of us, and even fixed for free a couple of minor things that were actually a little out of warranty). 

And, finally, it's eye-catching. Lots of people stop and say "nice car!" when they see us getting out, which is fun. No one ever says that (with a straight face) when they see me getting out of my other car (a 1995 Escort wagon, which I also love).

On the whole, I would say, if you are looking at minivans and wagons, make sure you take the Saturn for a ride too. It's a very pleasant upgrade from a company that was, for a time, loosing sight of its goals.
