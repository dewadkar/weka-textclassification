            To start off, I would like to say that whoever thinks there is ANYTHING wrong with this SUV is running an extremely high fever, or on opium. Proceed with caution as what i might say could shock you.

This suv has had only 1 problem in 3 years, the factory hitch had to have new bolts or something put in because of a recall.

This Lincoln Navigator has proven itself in extremely terrible condition, we crossed the Calfornia-Nevada line, on hwy I-80, in a blizzard, with at least 4 inches of packed snow on the ground without chains, we ended up putting them on to go back into CA just to be safe. This was when we were seeing cars that had spun out into the center divide, and snow drifts on the side of the road.  The traction in the 4LOW mode is amazing.  There are 4 different transmission settings, 2high (regular 2 wheel drive), A4W(automatic 4 whee drive, kicks in when there is tire slippage), 4H (alltime 4 wheel drive), and 4low (all time low 4 wheel drive) this setting is used for off road and slow snow use.  In this setting the Navigators air suspension raises the suspension up 1" for added ground clearance.  I wont even discuss gas mileage in this review because i did not buy this vehicle for that, it was not made for mileage (15-18 on fwy) about 13 around town

The interior of this SUV is second to none...ok so a Bentley or a Rolls would top it but come on...330,000 for a Continental T??  The seats are of top quality leather, and 
are extremely comfortable. The second row seats are bucket seats (same as the front), and the third row removable bench is comfortable as well. This suv seats 7, and has room to spare in the back, behind the 3rd row...albeit not that much because the legroom is so great everywhere, and they had to take room away from the rear cargo space.

The engine on this SUV is great, and we installed a K&N air filter, for added throttle response (definitely noticeable).
And custom dual exhaust flowmaster 70 muffler, with 4 chrome tips, this was definitely noticable in the lower ranges of power, although it does get noisy cruising on the freeway, but thats why the audio system is so good.

I do not understand the person that said they needed to replace their engine at 34,000 miles, and rotate and rebalance the tires quite often. A navigator is not a GS300 or a bmw 530i, (the two quietest cars you can buy), it is a durable Luxury Sport Utility Vehicle. I would not expect my Navigator to be silent, and if i did, i would buy some Dynamat Extreme, and sound deaden the entire car.  That way it would be SILENT. But dont start replacing stuff because it makes noise...engines do that, it's a huge engine (by todays standards) at 5.4L.  Its going to make noise. Well this is enough for me...you get the point.
