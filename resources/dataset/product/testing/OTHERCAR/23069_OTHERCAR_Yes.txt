            The Polaroid PDC 640 camera is a great bargain!! The price is nice and all the software, drivers and connector cables are included with your original purchase. This item is your basic point and shoot camera. The images come out crystal clear and are saved and organized in a folder with the provided software. 

The included software also has image enhancing capabilities as well as easy navigation when looking for photos previously downloaded onto your computer. 

The camera also has a downside to it (as do all products available on the market today). Using this camera without the included ac adapter will literally drain your wallet!! Purchasing batteries for this camera has probably cost me twice what I paid for the camera itself!! Whenever you use the camera, make sure you have PLENTY of extra batteries on hand, especially if you are the type of person who constantly checks the images as you take them to see which ones you want to delete. It seems as though using the LCD screen doubles (perhaps even triples) the battery consumption. 

Also, I have had a problem with Polaroid's customer service folks. So I know first hand what kind of hassle you get if the camera ever fails to meet your standards. Actually, all I wanted was for the software to use the driver with my XP upgrade which they do not have available at this time which is something anyone purchasing this product should know.

If you have Windows XP, this is a non-compatible item. I have the professional edition, so it could quite well be compatible with the home version of XP. Check this out with Microsoft or Polaroid to be sure before you go off and spend the money...

good luck and enjoy your product...
