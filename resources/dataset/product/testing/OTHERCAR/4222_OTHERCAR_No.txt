            Our Dodge Grand Caravan is the 1996 model, the first model produced with the new style and dual passenger doors.  I love the headroom, legroom, hip and shoulder room, which seems to be more space than most other minivans in comparison (from 1/2 to 3 inches difference).  The ride is smooth, the gas mileage is fair and sleek design won us over.

However, within a month or two from purchase, our back wiper blade and front wipers would come on as if some little demon had flicked the switch.  After turning a corner, the wipers would come on. We felt silly going down the road with both sets of wipers on in 90 degree weather. We took it to the shop.  They replaced some &quot;chip&quot; and the &quot;wiper demon&quot; went away (for a while - it returned again, replaced another chip and it went away permanently).

Four months after we drove it off the lot, we had hot hair blowing from our air conditioner.  We took it back to the shop.  They replaced another computer chip and we were on our way.

About nine months after we became &quot;possessed&quot;, while driving either at high speed (55 mph) or just a jaunt around a corner, the power would completely shut down.  The steering wheel would act like it was torn out of your hands, due to the power steering being shut down.  Then if you popped the accelerator with your foot, the power would come back on (most of the time).  A few times, I had to pull to the side of the road and restart the car.  Talk about a little frightening... Dodge dead while you're driving???  Yes, we took it back to the shop.  They replaced yet another computer chip and we were on our way again.

The power door locks are a problem - the driver's side passenger door lock does not lock automatically.  I've heard from a couple of my friends who own Caravans and they have had problems with their locks as well. It makes a sound as if it is &quot;catching&quot; on something.  But we know better.  The demon is possessing the locks now. We haven't gotten that fixed yet.

Within the first 16 months, we had several computer chips replaced, one battery, some other items I would have to check my service papers for. Demons or not, I have to admit, I love the ride.  I love how it handles.  But I don't believe I'll buy another Dodge Grand Caravan, or any other Dodge for that matter.  Our lease is almost up and we'll be out looking for another mini-van in the &quot;un-possessed&quot; area of the car lot.<br><br>
