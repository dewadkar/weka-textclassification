            This is by far one of the best cars I have ever owned, after 10 years of being strictly a GM owner, I made my move to the Dodge Intrepid, thank you GM for all the problems and showing me that there are other car manufacturers.  I have no complaints about the Intrepid, it is very roomy, has a great ride and handles like a dream.

  I have the 1999 ES model, which was a little pricey, but well worth the money, everyone who sees the car gives me lots of compliments on its looks and the car turns a lot of heads.  Having a bad back, the seats are one of the most comfortable I have ever had in a car, the ES has all the goodies and then some, the power and the pickup of the car is excellent, it's not a V-8, but for a 3.2 6 cyl, it's a good engine.

  The only thing replaced on the car, was the motor for the drivers window, it sounded like the window was not going to stop when going up or down.  Test drive this car, buy it, you wont be sorry, I'm not.<br><br>
