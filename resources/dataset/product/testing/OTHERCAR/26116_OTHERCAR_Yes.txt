            I recently purchased this digital delight out of a burning desire to have a digital camera to produce simple website photos.  The GSmart 350 fits the bill rather well.  Quality of photos are adequate for wallet size and 3 X 5 size prints or web shots. Any larger and the blur factor becomes obviously clear!!!  The simplicity of use is a real plus.  Power button on then point and shoot.  Be sure to have a steady hand when taking your shoots as the capture mode may produce a shaky looking photo.  No problem if you do..just review the photo in the cybershot viewfinder and delete it.  Mustek GSmart 350 control buttons are rather small but functional.  Only a few buttons to manipulate to make changes in resolution, delete captured photos, thumbnail, or slide show all from this very inexpensive and smart camera.

You gotta love the price of this camera.  It originally went for around $300 and has dropped to around $130 or less.  The unique cybershot viewfinder eliminates the need for a larger battery draining LCD viewfinder.  Additionally, the fast USB camera to computer connection makes for quick transfers of photos.  Downside of this digital camera would be the mediocre quality of the photos. Also, the lens placement is about 1/4 inch from the left side of the camera. Several times I would have part of my left hand in the photos while holding the camera.  Overall, these are relatively small drawbacks for someone new to digital photography and would like to start with an inexpensive camera like the Mustek GSmart 350.<br><br>
