            I recently purchased a 99 Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT Sedan and I am positive that my choice was an excellent one.  The Legacy Sedan has impressive steering control and braking ability.  All wheel drive definitely helps in conditions hazardous for driving such as snow and rain.  The Legacy grips the road well and never have I felt that I wasn't in control of the car.  My car gets low gas mileage, but this is because it is sturdy and weighs quite a bit.  About a year ago I was rear ended at about 35 miles per hour, and the driver who hit me sustained damage to the front of his car.  My car, however, honestly looked as if it had never been hit.  I decided not to report it, and no one believed that I had got in an accident.  I assure you the Subaru Legacy Sedan is a wise investment.<br><br>
