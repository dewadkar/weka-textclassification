               The Olympus D-490 zoom is in my opinion is the best digital camera for the price.  I've been looking for a digital camera for about 4-5 months because I just go married and wanted to take it on our honeymoon.  I looked at the Sony FD-73 which was about the same price as the D-490 but with less Pixels and the Sony was to big, you can fit the D-490 in your coat or purse with no problem.  Then I looked at the Cannon Elf it has about the same features but with out the quick time movie feature, that was to small.  Then I looked at the Olympus D-460 but when I seen the D-490 and the price wasn't that much different then the D-460 I bought the one with more pixels.  I also looked at some other 2.1 mega pixel cameras but to much money for me.  
   I've only had the camera for about a two months my experience has been great.  The great pics I've taken so for printed out great.  My wife wasn't to sure about me spending our money on a digital camera when she seen the pics I printed up with my HP 722 C she was very impressed.  When I took the camera to x-mass everyone I seen said &quot;I want you camera&quot; I think I talked my dad in getting one.
   I love how easy it is to use and get into the different functions.  The camera has a great look to it.  It has a solid feel about it.  I think the camera would last about for ever if well taken care of.  Overall there is nothing not to love about this camera.  Except for not coming with rechargeable batteries and an AC adapter.
   I think anyone who is looking for a digital camera in this price range should really consider this camera.  The easy use makes it so anyone can use it even if you don't know a lot about cameras.<br><br>
