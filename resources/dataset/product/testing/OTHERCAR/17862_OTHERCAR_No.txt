            On Superbowl Sunday last year I bought a new Chevy Blazer from Bill Heard Chevrolet in Memphis, Tennessee.  Little did I know that I too was going to be shafted like the Tennessee Titan were.  The basic gist of my dissatisfaction is that my car is a lemon and Chevy won't buy it back and put me in a better Blazer.  Two months after I bought the car it was back at the dealership replacing the intake which was causing oil to leak.  It was your normal repair and I was satisfied that the car was fixed.  Then I moved from Memphis to Chattanooga and found myself back at the dealership fixing the intake again.  I know am beginning to wonder if there is not a serious problem with the intake on this vehicle.  Then several months later the handle on the drivers seat to recline the seat broke in my hand.  It just broke.  So I was in the shop again getting that fixed.  Then not a week later I was back at the dealership having the power steering pump fixed.  I have done what I am supposed to do with Chevy trying to get the buy back implemented and I have contacted the dealership is also in the know.  What they have said to me is that the dealership won't do anything until Chevy tells them to do it and Chevy's feels that there is nothing they can do at this time cause the repairs are covered under warranty.  

My car is a lemon and Chevy should do the right thing and buy back my car and get me in another car that is not a lemon.

I am not saying that all Chevy's are bad cause when I did the research before buying the car all I could find were good reviews.  But I feel that what I got was a bad lemon, and Chevy should stand buy its cars and replace it and fix whatever the problem is and sell it to another consumer.

Regardless of what happens with Chevy I will not be in that truck after the warranty runs out.  I would like to be in a Chevy but I most likely be in another car.
