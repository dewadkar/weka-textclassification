            We originally purchased a used 1992 Mazda MPV with 30,000 miles in 1994.  We drove the van for almost 7 years and 130,000 miles.  It was such a great vehicle, when the new model came out for 2000.  I just had to have it!

We were in the mood for a car, but needed the extra seating for hauling our sons friends and all the other hauling that goes with a family.  I loved the sunroof and the 6 cd player, also the new look was so original and striking.  I used the internet and the epinions sight for pricing and hints on what to buy and how much to spend.  

We were very pleased with the deal and the detail regarding pricing was very advantageous when negotiating.  It came down to two salesman who would work with me.  We were able to purchase the vehicle within 40 miles of our house.  

We ended up with the LX model with roof rack, 6 disc cd changer, moonroof, GFX, and Touring Package.  The list price was $27,500 we purchased the van for $24,600 or $21,600 with our 1992 Mazda MPV as a trade.  

I would highly recommend this vehicle for family use or for those who enjoy a comfortable, easy to manuever, good gas mileage vehicle that will seat 7.  My teenage boys love riding in this van!  We all thoroughly enjoy the moonroof and the cd player.  Also, the roll down back windows!!!  The back seat drops flush to the floor with two simple pulls, also flips backwards for tailgating!  We used this feature at a softball game last week, it was great!

Good luck in your negotiating process, that is the hard part!  Do your homework!!!<br><br>
