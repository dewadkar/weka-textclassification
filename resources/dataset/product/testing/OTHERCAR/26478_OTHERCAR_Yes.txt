            I bought my used '89 S-10 because I had to replace my Cimmaron a deer fell head over heels for. I like the get up and go, economy with power!  The truck looks good, runs good, and is actually quite easy to work on if one is of the mind and body to maintain his/her own vehicle.  I have replaced the water pump, starter, alternator, and brake calipers on mine.  But don't be misled!  The truck has almost 190,000 miles!  Almost every part is available at auto parts stores and is reasonably priced.  The air conditioning will cool off even the biggest hothead behind the wheel.  The engine gets to normal running temperature in little time and the heater works very well on even the coldest mornings.  The air conditioner does not bog the engine hardly at all, and the aerodynamics of the vehicle make it more economical to run the air conditioning as opposed to running with the windows down due to reduced drag.  The truck is very stable at high speeds (60-75 mph) and handles well in the curves, even for one who prefers front-wheel drive for stability.  I would recommend this truck to anyone who wants a light- to mid-duty truck that performs as well as it looks.  Mine is just a work/commuter truck, so it runs better than it looks!<br><br>
