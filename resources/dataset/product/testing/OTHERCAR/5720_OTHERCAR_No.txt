            The Toyota Solara Convertible is a huge mistake by Toyota. It is a butchered stock Solara instead of a convertible built from the ground up.
The Solara is a good car in many respects (Pre-Convertible conversion). The acceleration is outstanding on the V6 and it is loaded with lots of amenities if you are willing to pay enough. This includes power everything, leather upholstery, etc.
As for the convertible, the chopped off top results in a lack of stability in the structure and you gets a noisy uncomfortable ride. The top itself is poorly designed and does not seem to be 100% air tight. Occasionally droplets of water will sneak in, and you will have lots of road noise. The car rides quieter with the top down!
Another annoying feature is that you cannot bring the top back up unless you are in park. The Chrysler Sebring allows you to do it if you are going slow enough.
So if you are caught in 5mph traffic with exhaust in your face, you cannot bring the top up.
Toyota needs to redesign this from scratch to get it right!
