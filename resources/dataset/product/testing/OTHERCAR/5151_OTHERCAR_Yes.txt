            After shopping for trucks for what seemed like an eternity, I finally decided on the Dodge Dakota. I could not have made a better choice! With a love for the outdoors, and living in the city, I needed a vehicle that was diverse enough for both. I could not have been more right. The Dakota is fun to drive and has surprising power when needed. With the 4-wheel drive it can go almost anywhere and haul almost anything with ease. Even at high speeds this truck handles extremely well. The truck only gets about 15MPG and the room in the cab feels cramped at times. This makes long trips a little hard. However, for the money the Dakota provides the best value for the money. I have had no mechanical problems at all and it runs as good as it did the first day that I drove it off the lot.
