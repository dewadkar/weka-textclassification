            When I first saw this car, I knew this was the one. I picked it up for $15000 (I live in Fond du Lac WI, nobody seems to like foreign stuff here so they are really cheap) and there is nothing wrong with it. The engine is very smooth, powerful, and sounds really great. All shifts are smooth too. The interior is top notch with well thought out details. The seats are very comfortable. Controls are intuitive and well placed. The back is comfortable too, seats (again) are great and it's actually not cramped at all. The rear headrests drop out of view when not being used (by pushing a button up front). On the outside, the styling is a refreshing change of pace from past Volvos. The optional wheels look great (but I hope you have a big wallet for when the tires need replacing due to their 17 inch low (50) profile nature). This car is just plain great, no problems, excellent detail, and the promise of safety.
