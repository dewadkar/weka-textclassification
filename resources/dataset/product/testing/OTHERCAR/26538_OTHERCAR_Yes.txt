            I am only 19 yrs. old, but I have had the opportunity to drive/ride in many different trucks.  In my short time I have found that the S-10 lacks power, power, and more power.  I have the stock 4-cylinder, and there's plenty of room for improvement, unfortunately there are not many after market products available to help this problem.  I have driven the V-6 and that has much better acceleration and power, Chevy needs to make the V-6 the stock engine.  As far as the exterior goes, it is one of the best looking trucks on the road.  The biggest problem I have had is that the brake pads were replaced at 35,000 miles (ridiculous), and the engine rattles just a little bit.<br><br>
