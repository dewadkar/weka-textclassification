            I love this car... I shopped around, November 1998 for cars in the same class and felt that the Malibu was a fun, sporty and yet practical car.

My Sandrift Malibu [gold] has a great fold down, split backseat which has been handy when traveling with gifts for the holidays or moving furniture.  I fit a bookshelf unit in the trunk/backseat this summer. 

The CD stereo system in this car is great!

Quirks: I often bump my elbow on the up/down door lock and lock myself in without knowing it.  [Not a downfall, probably a safer way to drive.]  I also chose the base model, not the LS and without cruise control; I regret not having the cruise control, but the base model has proved to be quite adequate and it did save me some $$$.  

This car is good for families, big enough for my 6'4&quot; relatives, roomy enough for me to not get kicked too often by the kids in the carseats. I would also recommend this car for single unmarried persons, as it is roomy enough to pickup all your friends and go out for the night, and has a huge trunk for the luggage.<br><br>
