            The first time you touch the gas you'll never go back.  The Bonneville SSEi is a classy car that does 0-60 in 7 seconds.  The i - series supercharger placed on the 3.8 liter v-6 engine has more than enough pick-up for any speed freak, yet the streamlined molding,and large four door frame is appealing to even the clean cut businessman.  The main disadvantage that I see with the SSEi is that the large body is when it comes to manuverability and handling.  Also, because the vehicle is front wheel drive and puting out around 220hp it becomes a little hard to steer when applying a lot of gas.  As for merging in with highway traffic, there is no problem at all, the supercharged engine will put you back in your seat even at 60 mph.  Also the Bonniville's design makes it very easy to see &quot;blind spots&quot; while driving.  I definatly recommend this to anybody who wants a safe reliable car that can move as smoothly at 85 as it does as 20.<br><br>
