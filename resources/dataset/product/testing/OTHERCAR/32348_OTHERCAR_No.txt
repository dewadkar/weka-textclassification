            I have been a loyal VW owner for about the last 12 years. This is my fourth VW, including two Jettas, and a diesel Rabbit. I bought this car outright from the dealer and have been impressed with the power of the engine and responsive handling. I lived in Germany for a few years and this car proved itself on the Autobahn many times.

The problem I have been having is with the continued burning out of the wiring harness within the steering column. The first time it happened was within a month of owning the car and I passed this off as a fluke in a new automobile and the warranty replaced this at no cost. The second time happened on the Autobahn and smoke filled the car while blowing out most of the electronics in the dash. I replaced this at my cost since a US warranty is void overseas. I have spent over a $1000 to replace all the damage caused and I still have another approx. $500 worth of work to fix the cruise control system. Both occurrences happened under 50,000 miles. I have kept up on the maintenance of the vehicle and the only change I made was to replace the stereo with a new one. This greatly improved the sound even with the original speakers. The only other major problem is that the door moldings constantly fall off and have to be reglued.

Other problems encountered include replacing the door locks because they fell apart while turning the key, changing the tires, and having the sunroof fixed.

So far, VW has refused to help me with this problem and after this, I will not buy another VW
