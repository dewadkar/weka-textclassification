            Wow, what can I say?  My wife came home one day after driving our old Trooper and dropped the bomb.... she wasn't going to drive that old Trooper anymore.  No problem, right?  She could drive my pick-up, and I'll drive the old Trooper.  That lasted about a week.  "Honey, maybe we should consider getting you another car", I mumbled at the dinner table.  The horses were out of the gate, the cat was out of the bag, and the search began.  Besides, I wanted my truck back.  

Okay, so we looked at a 2003 Corolla, and we would have bought it if the dealer would have come off his price a hair, had to pass it up, too high, besides, it was BORING.  We drove a 2002 Jetta GL TDI (used) in Abeline, Texas, and we liked it, but it had roll down glass.  Sure, it would go 750 miles on a tank of fuel, but you had to roll the glass down by hand, and it was perhaps a bit pokey.  No sir.

Then, as serendipity goes, we stumbled upon a 2000 Jetta GLS VR6.  It had all the moves, leather, moon roof, power everything, and a paltry 28,000 miles on the clock.  This car, well equipped as it was, went for about the same price as the 2002 TDI with only 9000 miles on it.  When it all came to a head, we bought the VR6, as much as I extolled the virtues of one ton pick-up truck fuel for the little car, my wife resisted in favor of those leather seats and moon roof, and I'm glad she did.  Snob appeal piqued her sense of style, but the bonus was in the VR6 for me.  

<b>Ticket Waiting to Happen:</b> This little gem of German engineering, albeit assembled in Mexico, is a car that likes to scoot, and how.  For those not familiar with the 174 HP VR6 engine, here's the quick lowdown.  It is a very peculiar narrow angle V design (15 degrees) and uses one head for the two cylinder blocks, and the exhaust flows out of one side of the engine.  The idea behind this ingenious design was to fit a small V-6 in the space usually occupied by a four banger (and trust me, the 2.0 liter VW four is a real yawner, the 1.8T now available is very good).  Because of the narrow angle design, the engine pulls with the torque of an inline six cylinder, very BMWesque.  As a matter of fact, if you squint your eyes when you nail it, you can pretend that you are in a 325i.  One unusual feature of this engine is the oil capacity, a whopping 7.5 quarts.  This "well oiled" engine displaces a healthy 2.8 liters, and is certainly the star attraction of this little sedan.  Upon acceleration it growls with aplomb, and its torque curve is matched perfectly with the four speed automatic in our car.  At highway speeds it sings along, the very definition of smooth.  29 MPG is what you should expect highway, about 22 city or mixed driving.  

<b>Looking for Drivers?:</b> VW always had those adds, "drivers wanted", and that Madison avenue hogwash always beaded up and trickled off my dense forehead.  If they would have said, "this car will haul buggy and perhaps excite you a bit", I might have looked at one sooner.  These little cars are the heat, I'm here to report.  The handling and steering of this car are probably the best of any I have ever owned.  The rack and pinion/MacPherson strut front wheel drive is inclined towards a little bit of understeer if you choose to flex the sidewalls, but it is not excessive.  The suspension is taut as far as I'm concerned, and if you've only driven Buicks, you might find it disconcerting.  If I had to describe the road manners of this little sedan in one word, I would have to say, "composed".  AT fifty miles an hour it is composed, at 90 miles an hour it is rock solid, and at 115 miles per hour, it may seem that you are just making your way down the interstate, but you need to understand that the Highway Patrol may not see the beauty in all the stability and the tranquil nature of your ride.  They will probably write you a fat ticket, after they catch up with you, of course. 

<b>Inside Story:</b> If you are seven feet tall you may pass on the Jetta.  If you weigh 300 lbs, you might look for something a little larger.  If you are of average proportions, the Jetta may fit just fine.  The steering wheel is telescopic and tilt worthy.  The seats are small and well bolstered, but the leather may be a little firm for some people's tastes.  I recently drove the car 2000 miles on a last minute road trip in a five day window, and I found it very comfortable after I adjusted the seat just right.  The seat goes six ways, with a pump that raises and lowers the thigh cushion, you can change the rake with a knurled knob, and you can change the lumbar support firmness.  You can also move the seat forward and back with a nice handle, not the cheap metal bar in many GM and Ford badged products.  The leather seating option has a center arm rest (you fight with the passenger for this thing), and heated seats (you turn this up in the summer to watch your passenger start to squirm).  If you spend a couple of minutes, you can adjust the driver's seat to a just-right position if you are more or less average in size.  The car has a very small back seat.  If you regularly haul rear seat passengers, may I show you a Passat?  If you haul a kid or two in the rear seats, don't leave so fast... There is plenty of room for the little ones back there, give it a look.  The trunk is capacious and more than willing to swallow suitcases, coolers, golf clubs, you name it.  With its low entry and nice chrome skid plate treatment, looking into the trunk will please.  There is also a 12v outlet back there, just for your convenience! 

<b>Exterior Styling:</b> It is hard to find fault in the Jetta's exterior styling, except for perhaps the oversized chrome VW badge in the grill, it's roughly the size of a cantaloupe.  Our Jetta is white, with color coded door handles, grill and fairings.  The car is crisp and clean, and the styling cues are meaningful.  With the 16 inch allow wheels, the car has a muscular demeanor.  I really like the styling of the vehicle.   

<b>Amenities:</b> The sound system in this car is excellent.  The system in ours was the middle of the road, not the available Monsoon, but the eight speaker, six CD changer cassette deck model.  This system has some great sounds, and some real power to bring the music right up to the fore.  Of course, you'll annoy anyone riding with you, so this option is best left for solo cruising.  The moonroof has an excellent control scheme, using a rotary knob so you can dial the setting you want and let go, not the annoying button that you have to hold down on lesser designs.  The fit and finish of the interior of this car seems very well done, and the leather seating is substantial and well stitched.  The car also has 60/40 fold down rear seats, a truly ingenious design to help sedan owners get longer cargo into their car (you never know when you might find a good deal on fishing rods).  The car also has an integrated keyless entry in the key fob, that actually contains the key blade.  At first I thought it was frivolous, but after using it for a bit, I really liked it.        

<b>Cons:</b>   Another con could be road noise, there is a bit of tire grind, but it really depends on road surface.  Many times, if the road surface is smooth the car is very quiet, even up to autobahn speeds.  Also, wind noise is very good in my estimation, the car is fairly hushed. 

<b>Safety:</b> 2000 and up Jettas feature some impressive safety items as standard equipment.  Full next generation airbags front and side for the forward seat passengers are part of the GLS package.  All wheel ABS is standard on all Jettas (you'll pay extra for this on most all japanese import sedans in this category).  The VR6 has standard Anti-Slip Regulation traction control both automatic and standard (which can be cancelled out with a button on the stack, but why would you?  Oh yeah, smoking the tires at a dragstrip).  The car does very well in crash testing, but it is small, so you have to factor in the weight margin.  It is such a quick and manueverable car, however, that you should have no problem dodging the slippery boiled peanut hulls being thrown at you from the truck you are about to pass ahead. 

<b>Let's not forget the sacred cupholders:</b> The cupholders in the Jetta are lame.  An assembly emanates from the dash (you've seen it) and the cups hang right over the stereo controls in the center stack.  You'll end up with your Big Gulp soda between your legs rather than trying to use this cupholder.  Backseaters are out of luck, they are holding their drinks until arrival.  There are small cupholders emanating from the center console, but they are adequate for only 12 ounce soda (or beer) cans.  Backseaters are treated to their own overhead lighting, an option usually only seen in much larger and more expensive cars.  Also, the Jetta's vanity mirrors are lighted by a light <i>in the headliner</i> instead of the visors themselves.  There must be a German engineering reason why this is better.  There is a little flap above the rearview that is supposed to help you with that little space of windscreen that the sun can sneak through, I suppose it does its job OK.  

<b>Turn the Key:</b> Turn the key and hear that VR6 (requires 92 octane fuel or better) fire up, and you'll know that there's something different about this econo-sedan.  The difference is in the performance, the conformation and the composure.  This car will tick off the miles at speeds that will make your grand-momma hit you with a hog stick, but you'll be grinnin' all the way to the Sheriff's office.  

If you haven't considered it, give one of these cars a look, you might be surprised at what you find.    

<i>Update Nov. 17th 02</i>: My wife bottomed the car pretty hard on one of our town's drainage gulleys and cracked the cast aluminum oil pan, causing it to leak an ounce or two of oil a day.  I'm an ok hand at easy mechanical repairs, so I ordered a new oil pan from a VW dealer in Arixona ($129) and replaced it myself at my Air Force base's auto hobby shop.  The job took about an hour and a half, but was very simple.  The only thing that bugged me about this was that the transmission case is protected by a steel skid plate, but the oil pan is not.  The car is very low slung, and the depth of the VR6 engine has the pan hanging pretty low.  Fortunately it was a very straight forward repair and quite easy.  The mechanicals of the Jetta are very compact and tightly engineered, someone went through some thought to fit all that stuff under the hood, that's for sure!
