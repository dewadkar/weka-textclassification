            I bought this van because I can't fit my brood into a car (I've got four kidlets, three of whom still use car seats). It's a roomy but compact vehicle, gets decent gas mileage, and has all KINDS of room inside.

It's also kind of weird looking. I'm not sure WHAT it is about the back end of this thing, but it perpetually SCREAMS 'Square'. Really. I've got the 'Farfrompukin' and other necessary punk evils all over the back, but it doesn't detract from the overall *square* look of it. But it's grown on me. Like a mushroom :)

Now, the BIG con to this thing... its NOT a car for anybody who plans to work on their car themselves. Even a spark plug or oil change is a major pain, with the necessary removal of a large metal plate under the front end of the van just to get at the tune up stuff. Thank goodness my boyfriend is a heck of a mechanic, or I'd be paying through the nose at a dealership - I can't get chains like EconoLube or Firestone to do ANY work on the car for me at ALL.

We've also experienced some problems with the engine mounts, and we believe it's a design flaw in the year we got (1993 EuroVan GL). Two of the three broke at the same time, and the one that didn't is now broken. The work for the first two cost over $700.00, and with the sticker price for this van being as high as it is, that's a hefty chunk of change for repairs.

All in all, though, we're extremely satisfied with our EV. It handles excellently and safely in all weather (rain, snow, heat). The optional rear air and heat are wonderful addtions that enhance our long trips (through four National Forests in ONE Labor Day weekend) and short alike.

I'd recommend a EuroVan, but only to a family with a decent mechanic they trust or in the home, and only if you have a second vehicle. Just in case.<br><br>
