            I usually hate it when a new model of a vehicle that I own is released.  There's always new features that are more appealing, or additional options that I just wish I had.  Not with the new Odyssey. 

One of the most important features on any vehicle I consider buying is the  external lighting system. A well-designed lighting system is one of the best safety features you can ask for, especially when broken down on a dark road at night.  More specifically, I think it is imperative to have amber-colored directional/hazard lamps on any vehicle.  The amber color shows up much better than the red in any weather condition, and doesn't have the tendency to get &quot;lost&quot; in the brake lights as red-colored blinkers do.  If you come upon a car in the breakdown lane with red flashers, you're much less likely to spot it from a distance than a car with amber flashers.  From a distance, the red lights look like the brake lights of other vehicles on the road.  You have to get pretty close before you realize what the situation is - especially in rain or snow!  The same goes for following a vehicle that is signaling to enter or exit your driving lane.  With the amber blinker, your peripheral vision picks up the signal.  With the red blinker, you actually have to take your eyes off the road and look at the vehicle to distinguish if the car is turning, or just braking.  If part of the car is hidden from view, you may never know what the driver's intention is with the red lights!

Honda got this right on the 1995-1997 Odyssey.  The rear blinkers are amber.  For some stupid, unknown reason, the new Odyssey's are red (They are also red on the Acura and Accord coupes).  Why Honda would make this obviously inferior engineering choice is a question I wish they would address.  Amber directionals are safer, easier to see, and more efficient.  

Honda also had the high-mount brake light right on the 1995-1997 Odyssey.  It was a string of LED's.  LED's don't burn out like light bulbs.  They illuminate quicker, and look a lot slicker.  The new Odyssey went back to a traditional light bulb, which can burn out, rendering it useless.

While I'm at it, I think the windshield wiper design was superior on the 1st edition Odyssey.  The left and right wiper moved in opposite directions to each other, rather than sweeping in the same direction together.  I think the older design clears more glass area than the current method.  

And one other thing:  The &quot;magic&quot; hideaway third seat on the new Odyssey is not the newsflash that everyone thinks.  It too was found on the 1st edition Odyssey.  Thankfully, this wonderful feature WAS retained.

I'll keep my 1996 Odyssey thank you.  Sure it would be nice to have larger sliding doors and better cup holders, but I'd really miss the other items I mentioned.  On top of all that, my 1996 was made (and still is) in Japan, where the quality control has a proven record.  A good friend of mine purchased a new Odyssey (from the Canadian plant where they're all made) and felt some play in the steering after a few months.  It turned out that steering linkage was &quot;loose&quot; in several areas, and needed tightening.  That's not something you hear about from cars assembled in Japan.
