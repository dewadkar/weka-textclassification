            This was my 3rd Regal and second Grand Sport. I was very impressed with the luxury of this new GS.

The car did lose some of it's sporty suspension, and the turbo engine is not nearly as fuel efficient as the non-turbo-charged 3.8L - but it's very responsive and runs great. 

I've only had the car back to the shop for one minor adjustment in the 2 years I've owned it. All my Regals were very dependable cars.

The car handles excellently on ice and snow.

It has automatic headlights, and it would be nice if there were some indicator light on the dash to let you know that the lights come on, for those in-between times. 

The seats are very comfortable and the leather wears very well. I'd recommend heated seats for cold climates. They warm up instantly. However, the center console sits back a little far to comfortably rest the arm on.

The car handles very responsively and is very comfortable to drive. The turning radius seems good.
