            First, you need to know I have owned a list of &quot;sporty&quot; vehicles. You know...2-dr, straight-drive, sunroof/T-tops/convertible. The car I drove was my signature, so to speak.

Then along came my 3rd child. (&quot;Sporty&quot; vehicles definitely do not accommodate multiple children.) And we were planning a trip to the Orlando/Daytona, FL. area. The change in vehicle style was inevitable, however not very welcomed.

I started shopping around for a vehicle that would accommodate my family of 5, with room for luggage and toys while traveling. The only option was a VAN. Definitely, not me!

I looked at every make and model of vans on the market. Other than being safe and mechanically sound, I was looking for sleekness/style, options, and comfort. The only Van I found that could accommodate me in all these areas was the Dodge Grand Caravan!

I'm so thankful for the sliding doors on both sides and the integrated car seats. The middle and rear seats both recline and can easily be removed/reinstalled. (This really makes cleaning it up a breeze if you know how it is to try to clean up spilled drinks and food/candy from beneath the seat). The rear seat is adjustable, which is very convenient when extra cargo area is needed, but not quite enough to require the seat to be completely removed. Also to help ensure the comfort of all aboard, the Dodge Grand Caravan has front/rear climate control fans.

Those are the highlights for me, a stay-at-home mom of three (ages 2,4, &amp; 10). I recommend this van to all who are looking for both style and comfort. I get alot of compliments on my van! <br><br>
