            If I had to get a pickup, this is the one it would be. However, my friend owns it, so I can live vicariously through him.

This is a great truck. It is very fast, and it looks nice also. His truck has been lowered a little so it doesn't sit up so high that I must jump in. 

This truck has a huge Dodge Magnum V8, which puts out close to 250 horsepower when it is standard, equip it with a performance chip, as he has, and it pushes 300HP. Not to shabby!

The Dodge Magnum truck has plenty of room in the front cab, if you sit three wide, and don't mind banging into each other all the way to where you are going. So this is more or less a truck for one or two people, not a family. Unless you are irresponsible and will allow the children to sit in the back pick up bed.

The interior is a nice and spacious for two people, it appears to have a normal bench seat, but it doesn't. You can actually adjust the tilt of the back of your seat, unlike your normal bench seat. This is nice. There is also a little room behind the seat so that you can throw something, provided it is not all that big. A grocery bag or two really is the limit. Not a tall grocery bag either, as the seats slants back and you would crush the eggs at the top of the bag if you had the seat all the way back. If you are short, you can move the seat forward and you will have more room behind it to store things. 

Why not just throw all your groceries in the bed?
Because they will spill all over the place when you hit the gas, they will tip over in the bed and you'll have to crawl all the way up to the front to grab the oranges that spilled out. They will spill too, because when you hit the gas in this truck, it MOVES.

This is a truck which seems much wider than your regular car, so it handles differently also, and does take a little to get used to. It is great fun because of how normal the truck looks, yet it has such great speed. Although it is illegal, it is fun to race all the little punks in their wanna be cars who think they are up to the challenge.

Of course this truck has a great drawback.

Gas mileage. You'll get 12 miles per gallon. Expect not much more. This really is awful with the price of gas these days, especially if you stick that performace chip in the engine and you have to use 93 octane gas in it all the time. You'll have to take out a small loan to drive it.

It sure is a nice truck, expensive, but very powerful, and it holds a lot in the bed. <br><br>
