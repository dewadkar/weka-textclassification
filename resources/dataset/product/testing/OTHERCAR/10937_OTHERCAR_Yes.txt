               Over the years, I must say I have become quite an automotive enthusiast and over these years, I have tried to test drive as many cars as I possibly could. This past month, I had the chance to drive two versions of the BMW 3 Series. Never have driven a BMW, I was not sure what to expect. Needless to say I was blown away!
   First was the 328i with the 2.8 liter inline six and five speed Steptronic automatic transmission. It belongs to a fraternity brother of mine who was kind enough to let my drive it. Everything the magazines say about BMW handling is true. This car was taking curves at 65MPH that my Mazda won't take at 45MPH. The steering was particularly sharp and the brakes worked perfectly. The Steptronic transmission is the best automatic I have ever used, smooth and decisive.
   Second came the 323i with the five speed manual transmission. I must say I liked this version way better. The sound the engine makes is pure music, the shifter and clutch worked perfectly and even in fifth gear, the 2.5 liter inline six was still building power.
    Inside is a high quality, comfortable environment that is built for the driving enthusiast. Well placed gauges and controls shows BMW's commitment to fine ergonomics. The front seats are comfortable and supportive without being hard.The rear is a bit cramped though.
    Ok, I know I'm gushing, but the 3 series is one of the finest sports sedans you can buy at any price. Prices start in the low $30s for the 323i and go up to the $45,000 for the M3. In any form, the 3 series deserves a very serious look if shopping for a mid-priced luxury sports machine.
