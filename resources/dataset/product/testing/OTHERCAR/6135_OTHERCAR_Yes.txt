            We bought one of the first Impala's out in June of 1999.  Because the Impala was brand new, we certainly got a lot of stares.  That in itself made it fun to drive.  

We loved this car from the moment we test drove it.  We were downsizing from an Astro and wanted a car that got relatively good gas mileage.  This is a great size -- plenty roomy in front and back.  The cargo room in the trunk and absolutely cavernous.  The seating is very comfortable and I love all of the automatic gadgets!  The headlights come on automatically, the radio volume turns up and down depending on the speed you are going in the interior noise, the doors lock and unlock automatically, I could go on and on.  

We recently moved way out in the country, and we now have 36,000 miles on it.  Not one repair have we had to make!  Mechanically it is unbelievable.  We get great gas mileage -- somewhere around 28 mpg.  

I only have a couple of suggestions on the design aspects.  The vents for the air conditioning need to be able to aim somewhere other than at the occupants of the front seat.  The horn is VERY hard to find when you need it in an emergency.  The cup holders in the front are flimsy and cheaply made.  I think they have changed those in the 2001 model.

Overall I absolutely love this car and would highly recommend it.<br><br>
