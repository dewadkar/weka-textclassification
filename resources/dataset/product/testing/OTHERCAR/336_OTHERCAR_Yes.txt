                The Nissan Xterra is most definitely an &quot;image&quot; vehicle; and it lives up to it's active image.  Unlike almost every other SUV on the market, it almost screams &quot;Get me Dirty!&quot;.  Most people would never dream of taking their Luxury SUV off-road for fear of scratching their Pearl-Glow paint or denting their &quot;body colored&quot; bumpers, but the Xterra's molded bumpers, tubular side-step rails, and aggressive BF Goodrich tires are obviously meant to take some punishment... 
 
   ...But back to this image thing.  We all know, that despite (or,perhaps on account of) Nissan's ad campaign, the reason you buy this truck is either because it looks cool, but it is still just as tough as it's only real Utility competition, the Jeep Cherokee.  Unlike the Cherokee, however, this is a well built truck with storage racks, bins and tie-downs galore.  Still, I have used the roof bin to hold a wetsuit every bit of once, but just knowing how cool it is that I can is enough.  
   
 The reason I bought the Xterra is simple... it was the only SUV that had all the things I look for.  The CR-V and RAV4 are a bit less expensive, but also smaller, less powerful and too cute.  The new Ford Escape/ Mazda Tribute are similar in size and more powerful, but fit-and-finish and reliability are very important, and Nissan always scores high in these areas.  

     The Xterra does have it's compromises, however.  Fuel mileage is not great, ride is a bit choppy due to the welded ladder frame,  and, after washing, you'll never keep water from spotting on it unless you take the roof bin off and let it dry before putting it back on.  Other than these things, I've no complaints.  It serves it's purpose as hauler of my family of 4 like a trooper.  It's interior is spacious, quieter than expected and the ergonomics are very good.  Not flashy or luxurious, but clean and functional, just as you would expect. 

2 things to consider:
- Get the V6.  The V6 is really the only engine choice when you actually drive it.  If you get the 4cyl, you will regret it later.  The 4cyl model is noticably less refined, causing much more noise to protrude into the cabin, and it's anemic output may be dangerous entering a freeway.
- Get the roof rack.  The hump on the roof that accomodates its &quot;stadium seating&quot; is way too noticable without the rack.

     If you are young and active(or want to appear either young or active) this is your truck.  It's the Jeep Cherokee of the 2000's; Cool, rugged, modern and reliable.  It will be interesting to see who is the first to try and duplicate the Xterra's rugged, good looks since Nissan sold over 90,000 in its debut.<br><br>
