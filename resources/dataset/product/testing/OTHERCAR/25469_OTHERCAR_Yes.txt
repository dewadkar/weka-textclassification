            I'm really impressed with the Saturn family.  I had never known much about a Saturn or really thought to check one out.  I test drove a used car at a lot and really loved the car.  I then decided to check out the Saturn lot.  What a difference that was!  I never felt pressed and once you buy a Saturn you really do feel like a family member.  I decided on a SL2.  This is a great mid-size car.  I'm a tall person and have plenty of room to move around in it.  You chose what options you want and never have to argue or try to bring the price down.  Everything is standard priced.  I've had many cars in my lifetime and my SL2 is my favorite car so far.  I love it and would be happy to purchase one again.  Great gas mileage too.  I've not had any problems so far and I've had my car 2 years.<br><br>
