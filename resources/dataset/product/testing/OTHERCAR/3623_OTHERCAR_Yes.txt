            I bought my forest green 1999 Grand Prix GTP 4dr after reams of research. I have done about 7000 miles for the past 6 months now.  And I just adore the car. 

The first vehicle I drove when I came into the US as a grad student was a rented '97 Grand Prix. I loved it from the moment I tried it. Once I graduated and started working, I did extensive research digging up specs &amp; comparisons of all vehicles that would be within
and just out of my <b> price range. (20,000 - 25,000)</b>

<b>My priorities were power, comfort, price, fuel efficiency &amp; resale value  - in that order. </b>And I would say this is a very good buy for such a combination. 
I test drove the following 
<b>*</b> Grand Prix GTP 
<b>*</b> Honda Accord V6 
<b>*</b> Honda Civic
<b>*</b> Volkswagon Passat GLX V6
<b>*</b> Volkswagon Jetta VR6 
<b>*</b> Nissan Maxima '99 &amp; 2000 


The GTP topped in power, acceleration, spaciousness, price &amp; overall external looks (the last of course is  my opinion). 

The Accord was too sluggish ( to believe some professional reviewers - because its a V6 engine on the same V4 backbone)

The Nissan Maxima 2000 model was fine, but would come to $30,000 for the same features as the GTP. The audio quality wasn't so impressive at all.  

The Passat &amp; Jetta were great in power, acceleration, and looks (both internal &amp; external) - but the price for the same features as in the GTP was $30,000 and above. And the best loan I could get was at about 7% APR. Moreover, the dealers were really snotty &amp; charging a premium on the models because of the supposed demand for 'German' cars. 
Some past owners of the Passat I talked to weren't too happy about it, though they conceded that Volkswagon had improved the newer Passat models. 
Another friend of mine who has a new Passat says my GTP is smoother 


<b>Research &amp; References : </b>
I also checked out several web based reviews of the GTP at http://edmunds.com/,  http://carpoint.msn.com, http://www.grandprix.net (a site for Grandprix owners to discuss their car problems) to name a few.  All were glowing about the GTP. 

I also listened to lot of advice from friends - and tried my best to go with the conventional thinking of 'buying Japanese/German' because of resale value, fuel efficiency. The GTP just wouldn't let me. 
And the resale prices for post-'96 Grand Prix, I've seen are pretty good. 

As of yesterday, I'm back from a 1,500 mile trip over 4 days from California to Zion national park in Utah. And this car made it a pleasure to drive. One of the drivers in the trip owns a new Nissan 2000 Maxima GXE. He too was ga ga over my car. 
The average <b>fuel efficiency has been 25 mpg over long drives, and city driving gives me about 20-22 mpg.</b>

<b> PROS: </b>

<b>* Power - </b> 3.8L, 240 HP, supercharged V6 (equivalent to V8) 
<b>* Acceleration  -</b> 0-60  in 6.7 sec  (rest were in the lates 7's or early 8's) 
<b>* Spaciousness -</b> Lots of leg room, shoulder space - roomier than the maxima 2000, Accord &amp; the Passat. Trunk space also is good.( 16 cu ft.)
<b>* Internal features - </b>
�� <b>-</b>HUD (head up display) shows your speed on a non-intrusive console in the windscreen. 
�� <b>-</b>HUD also shows the current CD/station you are playing when you change them
�� <b>-</b>Common audio controls like volume, CD &amp; station seek, preset, mute are all embedded in the steering. You don't have to bend over to the stereo to manipulate these
�� <b>-</b>Red glow of the interior console looks great in the night. 
�� <b>-</b>An onboard computer shows the current mileage, range with the gas you currently have, oil, status of all the doors, etc. Its fantastic. 
�� <b>-</b>If a door isn't closed right, or the trunk is open it indicates so on a graphical image of a car
�� <b>-</b>Great audio quality
�� <b>-</b>If you don't take the Bose audio, you get a 7 band Graphic Equalizer that more than makes up for the loss.
�� <b>-</b>As quiet as any other car inside, though sounds like an aircraft from the outside.
�� <b>-</b>Power controls for seat adjustment 
<b>* Dealer experience -</b> maybe I was lucky, but the dealers weren't pushy at all. Instead of haggling at monthly rates, I just told them the price &amp; APR I was interested in, and how much I dealer commision I was ready to pay them. They worked out something for me there.
<b>* Price</b> - I got it at $24,500 including only a 3% dealer markup over invoice. And 0% APR financing from GM over 3 years. On road, it was 26,600. 
<b>* External looks -</b> the muscled look is just great from most angles. 
<b>* Handling - </b> Power steering handles great, and the ABS brakes are pretty fast. I tried that out just yesterday at 100mph on the highway. You just can't get over the feeling where the rest of the traffic looks stationary. :-) 
<b>* Tough 5 mph bumpers - </b> A while ago I touched another Mazda van at about 3-4 mph. The Mazda bumper went to Mazda heaven, and my GTP had nothing but some paint specs on it. 

<b> CONS: </b>
<b>* </b>Internals (even leather) don't look as good as the Passat or the Jetta or the 2000 Maxima. 
<b>* </b>No tape player - only radio/CD &amp; equalizer
<b>* </b>Tires - GM starts you off with cheap noisy tires, but you can put better ones after the first set. 
<b>* </b>The brakes groan sometimes  - but that I've seen in most V6 machines 
<b>* </b>Only available in automatic 
<b>* </b>Only premium gas - hurt me quite a bit esp. during the gas price increase in California.
<b>* </b>The 4 dr forest green I have doesn't look good from behind - the trunk looks a bit too big 
<b>* </b>No great colours to choose from - I'd recommend only the black, white or the red.  They handle that size best.
<b>* </b>On the highway, be prepared to get some battering from your better half 
<b>* </b>Most of your trunk space might get used up in storing your speeding tickets 


If you are looking at similar budgets as mine, with the same set of priorities, this car is definitely worth a serious, serious consideration. <br><br>
