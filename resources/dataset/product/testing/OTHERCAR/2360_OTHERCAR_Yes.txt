            The Toshiba PDR-M4 is my first digital camera.  I have been searching for one for a long time, and had originally ruled out 2 million megapixel cameras as too expensive.  Then I came across the PDR-M4.  Even this was a little expensive for $499, so I waited a little while for it to go on sale.  It Eventually went down to $399 at Target, so I went one and snatched one up right away.  This is a great little camera.  It is nice and small, unlike many other digital cameras.  It takes really nice pictures.  It also has a lot of features, like zoom, macro, and a lot of others.  It is incredibly easy to get the pictures on the computer as well.  In about 5 minutes I had it all set up ready to get them on there, and the included program handles your photo albums well.  There are a few things that could be a little better.  First, the battery drains quickly, unless you turn the flash, and LCD screen off.  Another is they didn't include, and so far I have not found available a carrying case for it.  Other than that it is a great camera, and I would highly recommend it.<br><br>
