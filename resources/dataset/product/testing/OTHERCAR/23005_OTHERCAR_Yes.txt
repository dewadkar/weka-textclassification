            I bought this Polaroid digital camera kit because I got a great deal on it and I really wanted to go digital. But, my camera is capable of just 640*480 pixels and I found that the results that came out were mostly disappointing. <br>I would say that to get the results vary so much in low range digital cameras that one really needs to acertain where he/she is going to use it before deciding on what camera to buy.<br> 640*480 pixels (the most important thing to look for in digital cameras) give you a equal or better picture quality as compared to a normal camera when there is ample light and the subject is close enough. The results are really sensitive to these two factors. If you want to use it mainly at home to click some snaps of your friends and your house to send to relatives etc via the internet then this kind of camera is perfect for you. Its very convenient and you will find yourself taking and sending more photographs then ever before.<br>But, you wont be deriving any artistic satisfaction off the photographs. The results are pretty ordinary for outdoor use and is probably useless for traveling. These cameras generally dont have a huge memory so you need to upload them to the computer every so often.<br>The one great thing about digital cameras in general and which I found very attractive was that you can morf and edit the images easily with some software which generally comes witht the camera. Its pretty easy to use and you can really have some laughs by morfing the images of friends. I use this feature all the time and its become real popular with my friends.<br>So overall, if you dont have too much extra dough and just want a camera for general use, go for a lower pixel one but remember it wont take care of all your camera needs <br><br><br>
