            This was my first new car and I love it!  I'm not so blind not to see its shortcomings, though.

Summary:
This is a fun car.  And it's pretty.  That's basically the begin and end of it.  When I was shopping, for the same price range, I could have gotten a loaded Accord or a Maxima.  Even though both of those have a smoother ride, I fell in love with going topless!  And it's a lot cheaper than owning a boat :-)

Pros:
* Power convertible top, nice to put up at those red lights when it starts to sprinkle.

* Glass rear windshield - You won't notice it new, but after five years and your friend's Miata window looks like your grandma's teeth, you'll see why glass rules!

* Roomy - the backseats, although a little uncomfortable, are very roomy, favorable comparisons to Accords, Camrys, etc.

* Negotiable - Chrysler makes a ton of these and promotes the heck out of them, so you should be able to get this car &quot;at or below&quot; invoice.  I went to www.edmunds.com, got the invoice price, and after test driving a bunch, made an offer of $100 over invoice, take it or leave it.  The first dealer took it (plus after rebates, I ended up paying $800 below invoice).  Try reading some of the epinions on &quot;How to buy a car,&quot; they have lots of good ideas.


Cons:
* The top can be hard to close sometimes--when I test drove a used Sebring, one top had obviously been damaged somehow and took a great deal of effort to close.

* Mediocre gas mileage.  21 mpg for a 170hp V-6 is fairly poor in this day and age.

* Avoid the built-in security system if you can.  When I test drove used models, I had THREE alarms go nuts.  One of the salesmen claimed that that was a serious issue with older Sebrings.

* Poor resale.  The resale value has a little to do with reliability (Chrysler had a horrible rep in the 80's), but reliability has improved markedly in the past five years.  The main reason resale is low is that rental car agencies LOVE this car.  There are therefore a lot of 2-3 yr old rental cars in the used car market.  DON'T BUY THEM.  As someone who drove a lot of rental cars, let me tell you that rental cars ARE ABUSED (not by me, but by plenty of people).  They are never discounted enough to account for the additional abuse, in my opinion.

Recommendations:
* No matter what model you get, get the V-6.  The 4-cylinder was just too wimpy.

* The JXi, in my opinion, was overpriced for the options you get.  Get the JX with the V-6.

* Avoid the Security System package

* This is a big roomy car, but it is not a family car.  With the top down, it gets pretty windy in the back :-)  Nor is there a ton of trunk space (enough for two suitcases and a golf bag).

* Don't buy a former rental (1-2 yrs old, high mileage).  Rental convertibles, especially, get abused.
