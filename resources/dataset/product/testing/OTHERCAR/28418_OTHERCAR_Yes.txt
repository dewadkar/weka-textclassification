            I bought a '98 Maxima SE in November '97.  I was considering several other cars at the time, including the all new Passat and the Audi A4.  For the amount of money that I wanted to spend, the Maxima was the only car I could get loaded.  So far, I haven't had any major mechanical problems.  The only thing I've had to fix is a part from the emissions system, but that was only very minor.  I've already got close to 60k miles on it (I know, I do a lot of driving), and everything is running great.  The only minor things that bothered me was the finish of the dash was a little crooked on the climate control console, and on hot days, the rear right passenger door lock sticks on hot days.  Besides that, I'm very satisfied with the car.  Service is okay.  It's not great, but not as horrible as it is at American car dealers.  I'm planning to keep this car for at least until it's at 150k, probably longer, and I don't think that there will be any problems with that.  <br><br>
