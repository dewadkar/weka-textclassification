            We received this as a gift, and I couldn't be happier, but would I buy it myself? 

No way. We estimated that my mother-in-law paid $750 for it, because she always pays close to MSRP. I would say it is worth maybe $500, but even then I would advise people to either buy a cheapo digital camera for snapshots in place of this, or, if you want to spend money, get a mini dv camcorder that can also serve up digital snapshots on the side, like the Canons. 

Still, with these price complaints in mind, I have to say ... I love this thing. Let me explain.

What I love to do with this camera is take digital snapshots to post on our family Web site and to email them to relatives. The user interface is easy, the thing is reliable, and the batteries last a long time and charge quickly. The camera stores images on floppy disks, and you can fit a surprising number of medium sized, Web-quality or higher images on one floppy -- over 12 easily. You can also take near-print quality (but NOT print quality, an important distinction) images, and put 3 of them on a floppy. The playback function works great. The camera feels good in your hand. And it's so easy to use that children can take it, figure it out almost immediately, and have a great time with it.

So why wouldn't I buy one? I'm sure the Mavica takes higher quality images than a cheapo digital camera, but the fact is that for me, quality is not what's attractive about a digital camera. If I want a quality image, I still use my film camera. What I like about the Mavica is the speed and convenience -- the fact that we can see the images right away, and delete the bad ones, or immediately send the good ones. This could be accomplished with a much cheaper digital camera. 

Meanwhile some of the expensive, enhanced features of this camera, like its video and sound features, are stupid and worthless. The videos look like jerky, Quicktime movies from 1991, and they last all of 5 to 15 seconds (which is actually a blessing, if you have to watch one of them). The sound ... look, if you want video and sound, get a video camera, not a still camera. 

For $800 or more you can pick up a Canon mini DV that takes outstanding digital video, great digital audio, and at the same time can reproduce digital snapshots -- very easily -- which can be emailed to friends and family, or posted on Web sites. Since this is what I like to do, I wish my in-law had given me the cash she overpaid for the Mavica, and let me pick up the mini dv. However, she was extremely generous, and I do appreciate the Mavica now that I own it.<br><br>
