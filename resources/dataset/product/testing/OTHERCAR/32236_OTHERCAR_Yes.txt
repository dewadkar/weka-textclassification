            I've owned this car for about six weeks and have over 1,200 miles on the odometer.  We ordered it back in July and collected it on October 16, one of the first 2002 models to arrive at the Houston dealership, Advantage BMW (***** by the way!)

First impressions standing still were that the minor changes from the 2001 convertible were for the best.  New turn lights in the so-called Euro style and a number of upgrades to standard, including the CD player (previously a $200 extra) and an auto headlamp option.

After a three month wait, actually driving the car took some getting used to, particularly as the BMW replaced a Jeep Wrangler and our other car was a Range Rover (see separate review).  But the refined nature of the sport suspension, coupled with all the technical wizardry, helped to sort out the best way to approach this car.  After 1,200 miles or so, I cannot believe how quickly I have got used to the driving position, though I am still working on exploiting the power and cornering ability to the full!

The interior of the 330 CiC is extremely well made and finished.  We opted for both the luxury and sport packages and this provides all the amenities a Houston-based car needs.  The top goes up and down in less than 20 seconds while the seats are extremely comfortable and supportive.  The sport suspension means that every small irregularity in the road surface passes through the seat at slower speeds, but this contact with the road gives a better feeling of confidence.  The trunk is small but not impossible.  In fact it works well with our philosphy of simplifying the lifestyle; kitchen sinks it will not carry though!

Steering is fantastic.  The brakes are near perfect (I had to do an emergency stop on the freeway after about 500 miles and my primary concern was a Lincoln Navigator in my rear view mirror - it did not stop but careered down the freeway, out of control, after missing me by inches).  The Steptronic transmission is good, though I still have not quite got the first gear takeoff right - there seems to be a knack in making the 1st to second gear change work hard and smooth at the same time.  In sport mode the box is hard to fault.  I still have to master the manual mode.

Luxury appointments are all as one would expect for the price of this car - great stereo, excellent air-conditioning and very comfortable and supportive sport seats.  Overall finish is high and the little touches (flashlight in glove compartment) are welcome.
