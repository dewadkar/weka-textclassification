            Ask any mechanic and he'll tell you to get a Honda if you're looking for a reliable car!  When I graduated from college, I new I wanted an Accord.  So, in February of 1997, I bought a 1990 Honda Accord EX.  It had 88,000 miles on it, and was just the right price for on a student's budget.

I've had my Honda for just under three years and it now has 150,000 miles on it!  I've had minimal work done on it besides regular maintenance.  One job was replacing the EGR valve ($200), which apparently goes bad in late model Hondas, and you can only get the part from a dealer. But since, it's not leaving anyone stranded on the side of the road, Honda won't recall the car!

The other drawback is that the Accord is one of the most frequently stolen vehicles in America. And guess what...mine got stolen.  Fortunately, it was recovered (with $2500 worth of body damage).  These cars are easy to break into, easy to steal (the hoodlums yanked out the ignition column and drove away with the help of a screwdriver), and blend in well in traffic.

I love the size of the windshield.  It's huge compared to my boyfriends Convertible Mustang, and the Neon rental car I drove while the Honda was being repaired.  I also love the size...it's a 4-door sedan, but I can still zip in and out of traffic.

I wouldn't trade this car for anything, well, maybe for a new Honda, with anti-theft devices installed.  I get great gas mileage (even with 150,000 plus miles on her), I can still go 80+ MPH, I have plenty of room in the trunk for all my stuff, and the retail value hasn't dropped as much as other cars (mine is still worth about $6000).

I had the pleasure of driving my friends 2000 Accord EX.  There is more leg room in the back seat, a larger trunk, and even a sunglasses storage compartment.  It is so much quieter too, you can bearly hear it when the engine is running.<br><br>
