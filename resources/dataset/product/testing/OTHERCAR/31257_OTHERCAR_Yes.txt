            I just bought my Pontiac Grand Am 3 months ago and I LOVE IT! Its appearance attracted me first. Dual exhaust, spoiler, and a V6 engine, sun rood and good gas mileage really attracted my attention. I bought the vehicle because it was really clean on the outside and inside. The Pontiac had a sports car look to it and was red on the outside. Absolutely no dents on the body. I bought the vehicle for $5500. The only draw back to buying this car was it had 95,000 miles on it. But I barely notice the difference in the miles. This vehicle gets up to speed fast. I highly recommend Pontiac cars for potential buyers because they are low priced. <br><br>
