            <i>Hello</i>


<b>To start with</b>

Ok I needed a bigger car than my Corolla and I had three things in mind. Number-1: Honda Accord, Number-2: Toyota Camry and number three was the Nissan Maxima. I still ended up with the Camry. Why? I chose the safe way. When I spend this much money for a car, I want no surprises. Since this is my fourth Toyota, I know how reliable they are. Previously I owned an 89 Tercel, a 92 Paseo, a 98 Corolla-VE and this week we have purchased the Camry. We are still getting used to it.


<b>First Impression</b>

My firs impression of the Camry was it's size. This car is big. We never had a car big like this. I drove pickup trucks and cargo vans before but owning a quality automobile this size! When I got inside, I saw the same thing. It was big. Room everywhere. I love the interior design and the placement of the controls. My Camry is a CE model and I bought it used. This car is new for me. It looks and drives new. It even smells new. I am not sure who owned it but it doesn't even have a scratch on the dash board. In one word, it is very well kept and maintained. I somehow outgrown my Corolla, plus we have a child. The car has 15 inch wheels with Brand new Pirelli P-3000 Cinturato on them.


<b>Equipment and options</b>

As I mentioned before, this is a CE model with a power group. This means that this car has a similar options as an LE would have. I am talking about Power windows, locks, CD Player, Cruise control, Remote keyless entry and remote starter. The radio sounds very nice and the car has four speakers. Two big ones at the back. It also has tilt steering and remote trunk opener on the remote control. the starter will come handy in the winter time. The colors are beautifully matched up to each other. Outside the car is metallic forest green with than interior. The car has no alloy wheels or sunroof. It has no CD changer as the XLE would have and I am really missing the rear disk brakes. 
I understand that this is a CE model and I have no disk brakes. I also miss the splash guards behind the wheels.
I like splash guards, especially in the winter time when I know that the front wheels don't spray salt and slash on my front doors. This can also prevent early rust development on doors.


<b>Test drive</b>

Firs I got into my Camry, I thought the engine is off and I almost started the car right up. Than I realized that the engine is running when I looked at the tach. I could not hear the engine on idle running. When I drove the car I could not hear it much more either. The acceleration was a bit slow for a big car like this. The four cylinder Camry could use a bit more pick up. the transmission shifted up and down effortlessly and without a jump. Handling: The Camry handles softer than the accord and keeping this in mind I expected some under-steer. It did not happen. Nice surprise. I could feel the transmission downshift smoothly on the highway as well to be ready for my next move. I did not notice much wind noise or tire noise. It will take me a short time to get used to it.


<b>Over all</b>

I very highly recommend the Toyota Camry to a couple with needs and life or for a family or older people. For young people there are sportier cars out there. Do not expect sporty acceleration and firm handling from the Camry. it is not designed for that. Regardless all of this, the Camry looks very sporty and sleek. I have no negative comments say about it. It comes with a long power-train warranty and the price is very reasonable for a "mid" size sedan like this. The trunk is huge and the car is the best selling family sedan in the USA. No disappointment, jus going & going & going & goin & goi & go & g & @ &.............
