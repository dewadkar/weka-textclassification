            The LS420 is my second digital camera, purchased 2 months after my FujiFilm 2800z.  Since I've had it, its been on a few trips and events where light weight and size mattered more than picture quality.  So far I've been pleased - it meets all reasonable expectations for a camera of its size.  I immediately added a 128MB card for $60 and I was in business.  It also has features that you won't find in a super-lightweight film camera - such as an LCD screen and the ability to record movie clips with sound.

This camera has found a sizeable niche with me because I can carry it anywhere and snap shots at a whim.  It is the size of a cell phone, and weighs just a little more.  It powers up in just a few seconds, and it's so small most people don't notice you taking their picture.  How they feel about that is your responsibility ;-).  Folks like when I snap a couple of impromptu pictures and I can email them along that same day.

You must be careful with a camera of this size.  The flash is not powerful and doesn't brighten evenly for anything outside 10-15'.  There is no optical zoom, but I'm not sure that would be very effective anyway since the small size makes holding it steady more of a challenge.  Zoom optics weigh a lot and use lots of batteries, so in an ultracompact camera you can't expect it.  Like other consumer digitals, there is a one-second delay between the press of the button and the actual shot, which is something I'm still getting accustomed to.  

Update: It does beep at the instant the shot is recorded, which is valuable feedback.  I believe novices can get consistently good pictures from this camera, but it's not as forgiving as a bigger point-and-shoot camera.  The shutter speed is noticeably slow - I got blurry results trying to get good shots during a running meet on an overcast day, but perhaps this improves in very bright light.  My Fuji took beautiful shots of the same race.

The quality is very good IMO, but if you make mistakes it will show.  I only shoot at the full resolution and fine quality (2.1 megapixels gives 500k to 750k jpegs).  There is no uncompressed file option, but remember this type of camera isn't your best choice for capturing perfection.  Brightness and color depth is realistic, but I think the low-light mode is better on my Fuji.  Keep in mind the excellent quality is compared to other point-and-shoot cameras - not the big professional cameras.  My point is that when I carry this camera I don't feel I'm giving up much quality compared to my Fuji.

Battery life is good for me - I've taken 100 pics in a day with flash without the battery indicator.  One gripe - there is no battery meter, only a 'low battery' warning that signals the camera is about to die - now.  I suppose that means you need to carry a spare battery if you need insurance to last through a long day or weekend.  The battery is proprietary, which is an understandable concession to keep the weight and size at a minimum.  Charging is done through the docking station, which is also small enough to go along in my luggage+laptop on trips.

The LCD screen is par for the course, but viewing a picture is limited to zooming in to 2x.  This just isn't fine enough to be absolutely sure the picture has sharp edges and to verify, say, facial details.  But 2x is better than nothing.  Brightness is a problem on bright days, and since the viewfinder isn't digital, you don't have any other options.  Update: the viewfinder has adjustable brightness, and I forgot to try to turn it up when conditions are bright, so it's probably not as bad as my first impression.

The LS420 can also take motion pictures (320x240 @19fps, I believe) in Quicktime format.  Unfortunately, my other camera caps in AVI format.  The motion video works well enough that I can get good information from capturing a golf swing.  One gripe - the automatic brightness adjustment changes the brightness about once per second, so if you pan across areas of different brightness it adjusts the brightness in noticeable 1-second increments.  Other than that, I think it's really cool to cap movie clips using a 6 oz. camera.

The menus are controlled by a joystick/button, which might not be best for everyone.  Also, the flash, light sensor, lens, and viewfinder are on one side of the front of the camera, so I find it easy to let my left hand get in the way.  I solved that quickly by using my right hand to primarily hold the camera, but if I'm forgetful I ruin the picture.  There are no finger contours or handholds.  Basically, this camera is small enough that those with big or insensitive fingertips could get frustrated.  It definitely couldn't be operated with any kind of gloves on.  The menus are easy to understand and are intuitive if you've done digital photography before.

As with my Fuji 2800z, I installed only the basic docking station driver and not the full software suite.  Once downloaded, I had no problems running on Win2000 and XP Pro.  The docking station itself is very easy to use - Just hit the big button when you want the docking station to be in 'transmit' mode, otherwise it functions as charger running on an as-needed basis.  The ever-critical connection in the camera does worry me, because it is largely unprotected against anything that could poke into it or gum it up.

It does not include adjustments and settings used by enthusiasts.  I do like the fact that the flash mode is its own button, as opposed to a setting in some hard-to-access menu.  The camera includes a useful lightweight carry case that resembles a sunglasses case.

More about portability.  I bought my first camera and took it on a 3-week trip to Sï¿½o Paulo, Brazil.  I took some very good pictures with it, but I couldn't carry it to many places.  This huge city has its crime problems, and a sexy-looking digital camera could walk off easily.  The LS420 will be going with me next time because I can carry it discretely in a pocket and it mimics a cell phone.  I can take it to night clubs, restaurants, amusements, etc without worry or the inconvenience of carrying a separate item.  Unlike almost any other camera out there, I feel confident that the presence of this camera won't make me or my things a target or give me away as a tourist.  

Update: this camera is a fun gimmick to take to social events - enough fun that it's entirely possible to revert to the role of detached shutterbug.  My favorite thing is to hand to a friend and ask them to take a few shots, repeat as necessary - you'll really get interesting results.
