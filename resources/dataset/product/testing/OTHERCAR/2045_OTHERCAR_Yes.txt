            Well.. it was year and a half since I bought the STS, 97,
white diamond -- same color as pictured here and the best
color in my opinion. The car is awesome from the performance
point of view -- it has a lot of power and you get it at
every speed, and no need to wait for turbo to kick in.
Very agile (despite being a pretty large car), heavy and
stable so it goes through the snow like a tank.

Inside -- a lot of luxury appointments and minimum amount
of gadgets -- so you are not overwhelmed. Most controls
are easy and intuitive. Pretty large, yet somewhat
shallow trunk.

And, of course, I love how the car looks -- sharp and 
aggressive at the same time. I do drive fast and it was
on very few occasions that people would not move to the
right when they see me coming. Just thought I would
mention this feature in case if it is important to 
someone.

Bad things: sun roof rattles a bit when fully opened,
CD changer is a step back compared to the after market
Alpine that I had installed in my good old Camry - it does
not allow to enter the CD name, does not let you go
directly to the CDs #7-12, sometimes gets stuck with CD
inside and needs a light pad to release the CD and takes a long time after you change CDs to start playing (well,
long is about 2 minutes).
What else -- yes, door handles virtually do not exist,
but you get used to it.

If you are looking for one of these cars -- I would suggest 
the 97 as the year to look for -- in 98 I believe GM 
redesigned the engine for regular gas and completely
re-styled the car -- personally, I do not like it.
Check the famous mid-engine leak, be prepared to add oil
between the changes no matter what -- these cars do 
consume oil. But, again watch out for oil leaks when
buying.
