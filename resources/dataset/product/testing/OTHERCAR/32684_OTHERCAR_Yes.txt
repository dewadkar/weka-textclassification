            Although new Town Cars are not as beautiful as older ones, they still loom over all other new cars in the aesthetics category. The ride is incredibly smooth, even on a beat-up road. The handling of the car is even more wonderful: the steering is nice and loose, and that's the way I like it. Small cars make me sick in the way they handle. You almost have to force the steering wheel around in an Escort or the evil Neon. In a Lincoln, you could easily steer with your pinky finger. Another wonderful thing about the Town Car is its size. The Town Car is a virtual living room on wheels. It has more room, is more comfortable, and flings wussy little compacts to the side in the event of an accident.
People think I'm insane for liking the looks of Lincolns, as many people are sports car enthusiasts, but I've always promoted Lincolns because sports cars make me sick. This car is suitable for those who want substance to a car, not the tastelessness of a Viper or other atrocities. The older generations would also love this car.
If you are not a fan of big cars, this car is not for you, but if you want to float down the road in style, buy a Town Car.<br><br>
