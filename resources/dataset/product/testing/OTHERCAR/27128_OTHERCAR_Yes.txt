            We bought our Safari right after our son was born.  This is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned.  We bought the Safari to have more room for our growing son and for everyday needs.  It easily holds a month's supply of groceries and cleaning supplies even with my son's stroller!  The Safari is extremely comfortable and rides very smooth. We took it to on a 14 hour ride to the beach and were comfortable the whole way!   The only problem we have had with the Safari is it does slide a bit in the snow.  I recommend the Safari for the growing family or those who need lots of room.<br><br>
