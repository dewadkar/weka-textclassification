            I recently sold my Land Cruiser for something a little smaller and more fun to drive, and I couldn't be happier with my 2000 4WD Limited Trooper.  Although not as luxurious as the Land Cruiser, the Trooper has many features that I think are nicer than the $20,000 more Toyota.  

It has an enormous interior for its not-so-enormous exterior.  The stereo is nice, although nothing to brag about, but it does have an in-dash 6 CD changer which is very nice.  The &quot;safari&quot; sunroof is HUGE and was a pleasant surprise.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much &quot;pick up and go&quot; the Trooper has. The torque-on-demand feature is also very nice and is monitored by a dash graphic.  It does, however, lean quite a bit during corners, even for an SUV.  Isuzu is known for their attention to detail, and it shows in the Trooper.  The dash is well thought out.  There are plenty of storage spaces and cup holders (important in a family car).  Side lights that come on when the blinker is activated.  Automatic climate control (seat heaters as well but I've never used them because the car warms more quickly than any other car I've ever driven). There is plenty of space for a family of four and two rambunctious dobermans!  I chose the black with silver trim color and I get SO many compliments on it.

Isuzu's customer loyalty is extremely high and I can see why! 

Add'l Comments:

I did have to have the truck readjusted after 5,400 miles as it was idling poorly during cold starts.  Service was excellent, BTW, and very thorough -- the truck seems to be fixed. 

MORE Add'l Comments:

The strange idling is back after a week or so.  I guess this means another trip to the dealer.

BTW, I just found out that I am pregnant with our third child and have found a drawback to the car:  the middle seat of the second row only provides the passenger with a lap belt but no shoulder harness.  Every seat in a car should have a shoulder harness in my opinion.  This alone would have been enough to make me use another car if I had had three children when I purchased it.  This will also cause me to look elsewhere when my lease expires in 2 1/2 years.<br><br>
