            I've only had my Acura for about a month, but I must say this is one of the best purchases I've ever made!  When I recently began looking for a new car, I discovered that there were an overwhelming number of choices on the market.  I basically knew that I wanted a 2 door coupe but I needed something mid-priced, mechanically reliable, and solidly built. Coming from owning a Mazda Miata for 3 years, I was also really ready for a luxury-smooth ride! I didn't want to go overboard on the price of a vehicle, but I'm at that point in my life where I wanted a luxury vehicle (with a bit of a sporty feel to it) and the Acura CL-S fit the bill nicely.

While shopping I checked the reliability of the Acura.  They have a good track record with repairs and flaws in the car itself.  Considering the Acura is essentially built by Honda, it put my mind at ease in the reliability of this car. Honda's reputation of manufacturing some of the world's most popular and reliable vehicles made the choice for the Acura that much easier.  

If you're looking for a comfortable ride, the Acura CL-S has it.  The suspension feels solid without that mushy feel of bigger cars. You can still feel the condition of the roads. Cornering is easy and responsive and the car hugs the road nicely.  The engine is quiet but has a bit of hum to it when you punch the accelerator.  This car can move!  Ever get stuck behind somebody going slow in the left lane?  The Acura quickly leaves them where they belong - in your rear view mirror!

The exterior has excellent fit and finish (I opted for the San Marino Red) with a subdued sporty look.  Some folks have been a little disappointed with the styling of the Acura CL, saying that it looks too pedestrian - or not sporty enough.  This may be somewhat true, the Acura's styling reminds me somewhat of a Ford Thunderbird. I still think it looks classy!

You're not going to turn heads with the styling - if you want that, pay several thousand more and go with a Mercedes CLK class or BMW Z3.

The interior is beautifully appointed in either ebony or parchment colored leather. Seating is comfortable yet firm.  The well designed bucket seats (2 front and 2 rear) covered in perforated leather, cradle the passengers with excellent side supports and a nice adjustable lumbar support for the driver.

The dash is well designed for easy viewing day or night and the gauges (tachometer, speedometer, fuel/coolant/oil) have that sporty look to them. The windshield is expansive, you can view the world around you very easily without any real "blind spots".  The power windows and power sunroof - operation is smooth and convenient.

The leather wrapped steering wheel has controls for the stereo system and the cruise control - two of the most often fiddled-with items when on the road - so you don't have to take your hands off the wheel to find your favorite song or to reset the cruise.  I've found this a very useful feature!  

Speaking of the stereo system, it has just about every configuration available for the music lover in you.  AM/FM radio with scan and search (12 presets for FM - 6 for AM) a cassette deck with dolby and a 6 CD in-dash player.  The 6 speaker Bose sound system sounds really sweet and envelops you in your music.  The only improvement I would suggest is the ability to swap between CD's or radio from the steering wheel controls. 

One of the big selling points for me was the Acura's Navigation/GPS system. I'll never have to ask for directions again - a man's dream come true!  The navigation system is a 4x3 inch touch-screen computer interface.  The DVD based geographic information system's "heart" is mounted in the trunk.  You can buy periodically updated DVD's for it for about $150 - but I don't think that should be necessary for a few years.  The navigation system has 3 main purposes - shows your current position and surroundings, allows you to find nearby services by category (Gas, ATM, Restaurants, Shopping, etc), and helps you plan your trips by giving you the best route possible.  This is an excellent feature that I think all cars should have - just make sure you keep your eyes on the road, this feature can be mighty distracting if you're a sucker for technology based gizmos!  I could go on for pages on the virtues of the navigation system, but you really need to check it out for yourselves - either at the Acura dealer or the Internet demo at the www.acura.com website.

There are some nice minor comfort appointments in the Acura CL-S that round out this luxury car's features.  The keyless entry system, front and side airbags, rearview mirror that automatically tints at night, side mirror than points down when backing up, power seats that adjust to every conceivable driving position, a trunk passthrough for long items, lighted vanity mirrors and visor extensions on both sun visors, alloy wheels with 17" radial tires and super-bright Xenon headlights. 

The only negative points I can think of concerning the Acura CL-S may be that it feels like a "big" car.  When parking or backing up it's a bit like being a little kid in dad's car.  The front of the car can be hard to determine because of it's slope.  Another minus is that this vehicle requires premium fuel, and with gas prices rising higher every day, this may be a serious consideration for you.

The Acura CL-S comes fully equipped - so there aren't any option packages (outside of the navigation system) to add on to the car. There are a itemized add-on features you can get - trunk spoiler, wheel locks, burlwood shifter, mud flaps, bra, etc. 

Overall, the Acura CL-S is an excellent buy for those in the market for their first luxury car.  It has several features that you would expect on cars costing several thousand dollars more.
