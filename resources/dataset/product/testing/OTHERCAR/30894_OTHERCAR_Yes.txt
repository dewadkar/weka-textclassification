             My parents bought me my 91 Toyota Tercel my Senior year of high school. Now almost two years later my little Toyota is still very much alive and kickin!!
 
My Toyota has 80,000 miles on it, and granted that is excellent for a 91 my little car has never given me any problems. I am able to get 30-35 miles per gallon, which can increase when my tires are aired up to full capacity. My Toyota is a stick shift and has more power then you would think. Anyone who I let have the privilege of driving my car is amazed at how much power it actually does have.
 
 Aside from the great gas mileage there are still many more advantages to the Toyota Tercel. The Tercel provides a smooth ride, even at speeds up to 80mph (but I don't speed). I do a lot of commuting to the bay area which is good 2 1/2 hour drive, my little car does great of the freeway and in weather conditions. The Tercel also has a great body style. Even the older ones have the new rounded look, not like the older Honda's with their boxy look.

  The best thing about older model Tercel's are the price. I picked up my Tercel for only $5,000. That is even higher then the average price of most, mine was more on account of the low mileage. The Toyota even has capabilities of being on the sporty side. With the right system, tires, tinted windows, and paint, I have seen some older Tercel's which any guy in his early twenties would love. The Tercel is great car whether male or female, young or old, it is economical and still looks good.
