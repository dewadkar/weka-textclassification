            This is a review of the 1987 Omni which is very similar to the 1990 model.

Several years ago my father decided to buy a car for my mother. My mother had her license since 1966, but rarely drove, never had a car of her own, was intimidated by the size of my father's Aerostar van and was more or less frightened to drive despite the rather light traffic in our neck of Northeast Pennsylvania. 

Also, NE Pennsylvania winters can be very treacherous. One or two foot snowfalls aren't uncommon. Four-wheel or front-wheel drive would be the select choice in such conditions. My father had concerns of his own, namely fuel economy and the cost of a vehicle. Therefore, whatever car he purchased for Mom had to be small, fuel-efficient, safe and preferably front-wheel drive. The car was a used 1987 Dodge Omni.

The VW Rabbit-inspired Dodge Omni and its sister the Plymouth Horizon, introduced in 1978, were the first domestically produced front-wheel drive subcompacts. Quite innovative for the oft-criticized &quot;old&quot; Chrysler Corporation. Two sporty cars, the Dodge O24 and Plymouth TC3, were derived from the Omni/Horizon along with a car-like truck.

The car Dad purchased for Mom had 40,000 miles on it at the time. Fairly low for a four-year old car. However, my parents put an additional 90,000 miles on this little car over the next seven years. The car was teal blue metallic with a medium blue cloth interior. The car was powered by a transversely mounted 2.2 litre inline 4-cylinder engine mated to a four-speed automatic. 

Despite what we kids thought, my mother absolutely adored this somewhat homely little car. Styling isn't much of a priority at this end of the price spectrum, especially for its time. The Omni's looks said &quot;practical, sensible and utilitarian.&quot; Looks aside, this car had a lot of virtues.

You could drive this car like a Manhattan taxicab and it would still say, &quot;Thank you, sir. May I have some more?&quot; It was used almost exclusively by my parents in the winter while Dad's Aerostar was snowbound.  You could even drive this car on some surfaces SUVs would fear to tread. 

This engine was beautiful in its simplicity. Unlike a lot of cars with a labyrinth of hoses and wires jam-packed under the hood, there was a lot of room to allow one to service the engine. Oil changes were a snap. You could literally remove the oil filter with your hand due to its tiny size and location toward the front of the car. Replacing the timing belt simply called for the removal of a sheet metal cover. Spark plugs and tune-ups? No problem! Somebody with even rudimentary mechanical skills could perform most of the maintenance. Parts were cheap and plentiful, many which could be found in the local junkyard. You could practically build your own Omni since so many have been manufactured since just about every color including a woodgrain option. Omnis haven't changed very much since their '78 debut, so parts are very interchangeable whatever the year. 

This little engine also had a lot of get up and go. It was hardly a hot rod, but acceleration was still respectable due to the car's light weight. Turning radius was very tight. One could practically drive in a circle even on a narrow street. Fuel economy was legendary. Despite all my parents' driving, they only filled this car once every three weeks.

There was a lot of room both fore and aft in this little economy car. The dashboard had a really cool design. It's hard to describe, but the instruments were housed in a narrow vertical console, with two large circular pods inside, one of which included a tiny ammeter, oil pressure, and temperature gauge in a triangular formation. The car heated up quickly, even on the frostiest day. There was no air conditioner. The standard AM/FM radio was merely adequate and my Dad exchanged it for an aftermarket unit. The seats were fairly comfortable and the cloth material held up extremely well - no holes or appreciable wear and good resistance to stains. However, the interior plastic and vinyl materials along with their fit and finish would be an embarrassment in today's cheapest Korean import. This Omni didn't have an airbag, but I believe one may have been an option. 

The rear compartment with its lift-up hatch carried a lot of groceries despite its deceptively small appearance. However, the hydraulic cylinders supporting the hatch would grow weak over time. These cylinders may be inexpensively purchased at any auto parts store. 

Replacing a tire was even an easy chore due to its light weight. Jacking up a corner required little physical exertion. 

The very worst thing about Mom's car was the paint. Within a year the clear coat was showing bubbles. By the time Dad sold the car, the teal blue finish was peeling off in large flakes. It's too bad Chrysler didn't put much effort into painting these cars.

All and all, the Omni and its sister the Horizon would make an excellent choice for those on a tight budget.<br><br>
