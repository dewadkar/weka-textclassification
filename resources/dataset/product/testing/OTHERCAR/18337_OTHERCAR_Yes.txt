            I bought the Fuji Finepix 4900 Zoom in May of 2002, after many months of intensive research.  Probably like many shoppers, my biggest difficulty in settling on this camera was balancing how many nice added features in a camera merited a larger price.  I was specifically looking for a camera to photograph horses, so I was concerned with features such as a good optical zoom, varied ISO and fast shutter speed, good outdoor photo quality, and high enough resolution for magazine advertising.

I got an excellent deal on this camera by purchasing it new on Ubid. Having purchased based on reviews, I was quite pleased with this camera when I opened the box.  It is smaller in size than I expected, fits comfortably using one or both hands, and feels lightweight yet substantial.  The camera was packaged with a battery, charger, and Smartmedia card, and I could hardly wait to charge the battery to get outside and try it out.  

Having used the camera all summer, mainly for photographing horses, I can say the following:

1)  I really wanted a camera that did not require a lot of extra parts.  Working around animals, it is no fun to juggle multiple lenses, filters, flashes, and so forth.  This camera is packed with everything needed to take pictures and move them on to a computer, which is a plus.  I did add a few accessories to camera;

2) The battery has good life and charges relatively quickly.  While the batteries are easy to find and an optional stand-alone charger is available, I have managed all summer with only the original and one spare;

3)  The camera uses Smartmedia cards, which are readily available, and somewhat pricey at the outset but indefinitely reusable.  I bought a 128 MB card which I use most of the time, using the original 32 MB card as a backup.  The 128 MB card holds about 74 photos shot at the largest JPG format, 2400 x 1800, which is equivalent to about 3 rolls of 36-exposure film.  When you consider that you can check the pictures you have taken and delete them on the go, the large card is adequate for most picture-taking outings;

4)  The camera does pretty well on stop-action; as long as you hold the camera correctly when shooting, you can get fair clarity.  Unfortunately, the camera lacks an optical viewfinder, and there is some lag-time between pressing the shutter button and taking the picture.  As a result, you won't know exactly what picture you took--or if you caught the subject at all!--until you look at the photo;

5)  If you are trying to store minimal photos, the camera has a preview mode.  This is a plus for shooting stills, but usually not applicable for motion;

6)  This camera has a continuous shooting, rapid-fire, or "burst" mode, which is great when you are shooting a moving subject to get just the right frame.  Because of the lack of an optical viewfinder, learning to pan with the subject takes some practice;

7)  The greatest thing about the Fuji 4900 is that it combines good resolution with a nice zoom at a very comfortable price point.  The camera produces JPEG or TIFF files at up to 2400 x 1800, which are adequate for making 8x10's that are acceptable to magazines. The 6X optical zoom is a feature usually available on more expensive (or lower-resolution) cameras.  The price, which should become even more appealing as the newer models continue to be phased in, was the clincher for me.
