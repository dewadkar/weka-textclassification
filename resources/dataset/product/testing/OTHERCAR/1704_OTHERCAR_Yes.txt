            I purchased my Honda C-RV in the end of 1997 and have been very happy with it. It's very reliable and solid build car. Sure it does not offer a lot of interior room and power as big SUVs - but it costs almost 50% less.
Why did I buy this vehicle?
1. It looks very attractive. In my opinion it's the best looking SUV,
may be one from Mercedes looks better but it's a completely different 
price range. Don't forget to get a roof rack - it looks much better with it.
2. Price tag. CR-V comes full packed with all safety features: ABS, 4 wheel drive and etc. Everything is automatic - doors, windows, mirrors.
And all of this for just around 21,000.
3. It's very comfortable. You have a very good view of the road. Windows and mirrors are big. Seats are adjustable and comfortable. You can even 
get from the front seats to the back. 
4. You can move big objects. Fold back seats and there is enough space for a dishwasher or dryer in the back (done that twice). I even moved a set of coffee tables ones.
5. It's does not eat a lot of gas. I am getting about 23 miles per gallon in the city and about 25 on the highway. 


What I like in this vehicle?

1. I like to drive it - it feels very nice. You feel total control and it handles very nice. 
2. It's very easy to park. My second car is Honda Civic, 2000. CR-V is
much better than Civic when it comes to moving in the parking lot.
3. Very good view of the road. Huge windows.
4. Excellent stability in the snow &amp; icy conditions. 4 wheel drive really
makes the difference. ABS also helps on the icy day at the traffic light.
5. Plenty of storage space. There is a well in the back. I kept there an inflatable king size mattress once. Cup holders, door pockets and etc.
Everything is very well designed.
6. Back seat is very comfortable. Actually my wife likes to ride in the back seat more than in the front. The first time she tried a back seat - she decided that's the car to buy.

What are the weak spots of the car?
1. 2.0 liter engine is good enough for a city, but a little bit weak for aggressive interstate driving. Everybody likes to make this point.
Actually it's not that bad. I drove from Nebraska to Oregon once and had no trouble passing cars on the interstate in the mountains of East Oregon and Utah. Sure, I wish CR-V had more power but it's not really critical.
2. Air conditioning sometimes seems a little bit weak - especially if you leave you car in the sun for couple of hours. It takes a long time to cool down a cabin.
3. It would be nice to have windows and mirrors controls visible in the dark. 

This car is for a small family with no more than 2 kids that live in the city. It's not designed for aggressive driving or back road trips, although I had no problems riding on the sand dunes once. It has everything that SUV should have - but just in smaller size.
