            I will be sharing with you my driving experience in the 1998 Q45. 

This car sure speaks of luxury, but is that good enough these days?  Quality construction?  Spaciousness?  Safety?  Is that really enough?

Apparently not.  Sales figures speak for themselves usually, and I for one can't see why most people who opt for the 5-series BMWs and LS400 would choose the Q45 where it that they woke up on the other side of bed.

This car has a lot going for it.  The exterior shape I especially like, which in my eyes is CLASSIER than the LS400 (the headlights and tailights look real good), and interior space is quite generous too, even compared to the amazing competition.  Yes, the wood looks real good, but I think it's actually artificial.  

The engine is decent, nothing special.  In the handling department, it felt more composed under hard-driving than the LS400 for example, but that car felt &quot;faster&quot; in its reactions.  The brakes however, are perhaps the only thing I would truly give praise to in this car.  I almost want to say amazing.  I am not sure if they give shorter stopping distances than most of the competition, but they sure felt over-capable.  Very impressed, I was.  :)

And I am sure this car is dead-reliable.  Infiniti also has a fantastic reputation for customer service and satisfaction.  That alone in the United States accounts for a lot, but again, not enough.

All in all, this car is great, but that is not good enough these days with the consistently-strong competition from Lexus and the Germans.  Heck, I would probably get the new Acura RL over this car and save some money while at it for those hot tech stocks.  Yes it's a V6 and FWD, but so?  Unless you offer a hell of a lot more in your package on top of RWD/V8, it just won't catch peoples' attention.<br><br>
