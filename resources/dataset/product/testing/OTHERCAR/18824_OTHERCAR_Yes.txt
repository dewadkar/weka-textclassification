            I leased a 1998 Jeep Classic.  This was my first time to lease a vehicle and I am not so sure it was a good idea.   I must warn people to expect the unexpected when leasing.  Things, such as milage, can change.  The vehicle is the toughest one i have ever owned.  It holds up very well while it also has a rougher ride than I expected.  I would suggest buying or leasing the Grand model to anyone else.  I will next time. It holds more than the other sport utility vehicles of it's size in my opinion and drives better.  It really has more power than the others priced in this range.  The color I chose was the new gunmetal blue that I am in love with.  I hope they put it on a Grand model soon.  The last time I checked they had not.  For the money I find Jeep the best buy in a SUV.<br><br>
