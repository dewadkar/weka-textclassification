            The Saturn Ads are all hype.  The talk about customer service and dependability.  this is all hype built up by a very smart marketing manager. My wife and I purchased our 1997 SL2 6 months ago used.  the vehicle had 29000 miles and seemed to be in good shape.  Within a week of owning it we had it back to the dealer to replace the brakes and fix the clutch.  They did not want to replace anything for my wife and I had to visit the dealer to get anything accomplished.  it was like they did not want to deal with a woman.  I guess they need to watch there own commercials.  The car rattles and rides poorly.  We test drove one of the new SL2 series shortly after purchasing this one and they are just as bad, they just smell newer.  For the price one would do better going with a Neon or Tercel.<br><br>
