            After almost 3 months of research on this car, and the study of the relaibility of the Sephia -- I purchased my Rio and drove it off the dealer's lot on November 16, 2000.  This is a fanastic vehicle.  It is well made, rides great and I dearly love it.  One of the best things about the Rio is you have a 5-year, 24hour roadside assistance warranty (better than having AAA) plus during the next 5 years, all I have to pay for is oil changes.  Besides, my insurance company gave me a great rate and my payments are only $185.00 per month.  I highly recommend this car to everyone and know I have some happy years ahead as a Rio owner.
