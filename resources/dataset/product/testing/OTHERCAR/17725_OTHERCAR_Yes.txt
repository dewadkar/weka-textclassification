            I purchased a 1996 Saturn SL-2 And it was the best car I ever owned. 

When I went to the Saturn Dealer, there was NO dickering on prices, which I liked very much.  The price on the car was IT.  The salesmen did not work on commission, so they did not try to pressure you to buy a car from them.  They were very helpful, which made my buying a car a pleasant experience.  

The car was beautiful.  Aquamarine w/sunroof and a spoiler.  I lived in Upstate NY then and we had big snow storms...this car handled the snow great.   I was able to go up snowy hills, this car got me through everything, I never got stuck.  It also had traction control, which I would recommend getting if you have a choice. Whenever you did start to slide, this seemed to grab the road and get you back in control. I never had to get the car repaired....it was wonderful having one and again the buying experience was great.    <br><br>
