            I bought the 1998 Legacy because it was good looking and different from the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. I liked both of those cars, but it just seemed as if they were everywhere. 
I really like this car's unique look and I often get compliments on it. At first, I was very happy with most things about this car. The only negative was it's tendency to lurch forward when I was starting up after stopping for a light. Although this has not really been dangerous, I can see how it could be. Mainly, it's just not smooth.
I drive a lot, about 3,000 miles every 6-8 weeks. I've kept up with all of the routine maintenance, but before a full year had gone by I had started to notice that the ride was no longer as smooth and quiet as it had been originally. The Subaru mechanic in my town says that this is normal and there's nothing that can be done about it. I guess I'll get a new car.
 Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that this is a good choice for a person who spends a great deal of time on the road and doesn't have extra time for second and third mechanical opinions.<br><br>
