            I'm on my second LS 400 and there's a reason why this is the only time in 36 years I have re-bought from the same manufacturer.  How often have you done that?  My first LS was 1990, and my second is a 1995.  I drove the 2000 LS 400 several times, including today, prompting this review.  I have tried the Porsche 911 two weeks ago, and there's NO WAY the Porsche can compare overall with the Lexus--obviously, the incredibly sporty acceleration of the 911 and the incredible braking and the incredible handling are the best you can achieve when you buy any car at any price off a dealer's lot, but try to carry more than 2 six packs of Black Cherry soda in the trunk of the 911, or try to count the days before you kill yourself in it, either because of the phenomenal acceleration of the beyond belief handling.  The Lexus just doesn't whisper to you to try to be crazy--it wants and deserves and gets more respect from the driver.  I have looked at all cars available in the $50,000 plus price range over the last 6 weeks, including the Mercedes 600S (the auto Princess Diana died in), and NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, COMPARES WITH THE LEXUS LS400.  It somehow achieves that unheard of, not found in the universe, balance between sybaritic pleasure of driving, safety of driving, handling (I can't believe the absence of &quot;roll&quot; when you corner in the Lexus), and price.  The dealer is NOT TO BE BELIEVED.  After you buy the Lexus LS400, you are treated like a family member.  Your salesman does favours for you he/she doesn't have to.  The service manager, whom you had never previously met, does favours for you he/she doesn't have to.  Toyota knows how to run a business.  They price their cars so competitively behind Mercedes I honestly fail to understand why anyone would purchase any other luxury car other than the Lexus.  You need to drive this car.  You won't believe it.  It will haunt you until you buy it!!!<br><br>
