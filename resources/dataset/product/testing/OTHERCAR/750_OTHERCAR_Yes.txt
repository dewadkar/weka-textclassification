            I purchased a used 1994 Nissan Altima that had 80k miles on it at the time.  Now I have crossed the 150k mile mark, and the car is still running strong.  I have had no troubles with the car since I bought it.  With regular oil changes and tune-ups it runs just as well as it did when I got it.  I drive a lot, and I drive hard.  The acceleration is quite impressive, mostly, I believe, due to a good transmission and gear system that I have noticed in all Nissan vehicles that I have driven.  The handling on the Altima is also surprisingly agile.  The only minor problem I had was paint chipping off the front grill.  I have driven many cars in my lifetime, and I must say, the Nissan Altima was well worth every cent I paid for it.<br><br>
