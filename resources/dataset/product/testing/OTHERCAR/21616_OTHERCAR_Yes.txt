            I purchased my Grand Cherokee Limited in 1996 with low milage.  The vehicle has all factory available options.  Other then normal preventitive mantainence there has never been any major problems.  The only complaint is with the front stabalizer bushings that developed a squeek and need replacing.  This jeep has been coast to coast running for as many as 48 straight hours only shutting down to refuel. I tow a 26 foot RV, when fully loaded wieghs 6500 lbs.  This Jeep and RV have been across the states, over the Rockies, through and around the Cascade range without any trouble pulling the rig.  When I purchased this Jeep no other car maker had a comparable V-8 SUV in this size range.  I have never been sorry and would recamend this model to anyone.  I have 103,000 miles on it to date and it stills runs as good as the day I purchased it.<br><br>
