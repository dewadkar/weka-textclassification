<TEXT>
             The 1999 Chevy Silverado is a well thought out step up in the pickup class.It retains the original skin as opposed to the ultra ugly Ford and Dodge but hides a host of refinements in the powertrain, suspension and chassis departments.the truck is a pleasure to drive with plenty of power from the 5.3 liter V8 and fair gas mileage (15 to 22). 
 The One thing GM needs to do to make this is better is to pay more attention to detail. The truck is full of rattles, squeaks,clunks and other irritating foibles that one should not have to put up with in a top end $30,000+ vehicle.If GM does a little work to make this vehicle foible free they have a great truck and in the extended cab version it can do all the things you expect of a normal sedan and a working machine.
