            I bought this vehicle because it is the only one like it on the market today.  I have not had any trouble with it so far.  In fact when I drove it off the lot I noticed a small tear (from shipping) on the lower part of one of the windows and Chrysler was eager to replace it free of charge.  The jeep sells itself, just drive one. 

Yes, it is bouncy, much like a truck, but if you've purchased it for off-road use then you'll be glad later when it bounces. 

I have had no irritating flapping noises from the soft top at 45+ mph. In fact it is quiet enough to hold a soft spoken conversation. If the top flaps too much then it's probably not on right.  Remember, in order to take down the soft top it is recommended that you unzip the back windows and roll up the rear window WITH a towel inside (to prevent those ugly black stripes down the back). Taking the top down is not a push button job, but with practice it can be done in a matter of minutes.

This is definitely a safe vehicle for younger drivers. With dual airbags that's a feature that makes everybody feel safer. On my second day of ownership I backed into my friend's fathers' minivan.  There was extensive damage to the minivan but not a scratch on the jeep.  They're meant for abuse.  This vehicle will hold its value!

BEWARE: Dealers of used vehicles (especially 97 and prior) will try and sell you a 4 cylinder wrangler without a/c and promise to install the a/c free of charge if you promise to take the vehicle.  THEY KNOW THAT THIS WILL SEVERELY AFFECT PERFORMANCE, this is why they want agreement of sale before a/c is installed.  Three dealers tried this with me! If you still add a/c to a 4-cylinder you will feel as if you are towing a semi!  Please you have been warned!

I LOVE MY JEEP, and I think anyone who visits a Jeep 101, Jamboree or Camp Jeep will decide that's the vehicle for you!
