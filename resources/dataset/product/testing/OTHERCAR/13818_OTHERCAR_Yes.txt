            My first Mercedes was a used 1985 380 it was a great car that I was very impressed with. Since that car I have own 3 others Mercedes including a 560SL, I do'nt think I will never own any other brand of automoble.  Anyway, I decided to trade the 560SL for the 2000S. I knew the car would be a wonderful piece of german design but I was truly wowed over the new cars luxury, comfort and power. Getting in this car is a true pleasure. The leather seats are soft and comfortable, and they position perfectly for my short body. I also love the luxury features like the navagation system with its crt terminal built right into the dash.This has keep from getting lost a many of times. The car is very sure footed and handles wonderfully. People who buy this car will value its creature comforts and its command of of all things on the road. No one should buy this car if price and insurance preimums is a issue.<br><br>
