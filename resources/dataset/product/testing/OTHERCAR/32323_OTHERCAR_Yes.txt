            I have been in this car a couple of times and I must say the ride is amazing.  When the engine is put to the test, pulling off at a red light, you are thrown back into your seat which is odd with a luxury sedan.  Then engine is extremely powerful and the control that you have over the car is amazing.  The one quirk I don't like about this car is its lack of options on the control panel.  The stereo system looks extremely basic and it is probably to attract attention to the older generation who want to have a simple and comfortable drive.  Overall this car is amazing in its handling and comfort, but the interior look is very old fashioned and it needs to be remodeled for 2001.  If you have the money to burn, buy this as a priamry car for its comfort and drive, but keep in mind you may want to update the dash options.<br><br>
