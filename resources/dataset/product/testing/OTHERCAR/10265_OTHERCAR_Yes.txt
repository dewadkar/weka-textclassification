            The second car I ever had was the Nissan 200 SX.  I put that car through everything.  After two hundred-and-some thousand gruelling miles I put on the poor thing, I decided this February I would get another Nissan.  I got the Nissan Sentra.

I have only had the car for approximately two months, but I love the car.  I got a GREAT price on it (25,000 miles and not a scratch on it with a 5CD player in the trunk AND keyless entry for $9250)!!!  I know I did well on this one.

The car handles like a dream and takes the nastiest pot holes and turns them into minor bumps in driving.  Not to mention while driving it is easy to flip on and off the cruise control as it is right there on your steering wheel.

On the floor of the drivers side is the gas door/trunk lever.  This is an extremely great help to the driver.  You will remember to open the trunk from inside the car all to quickly.

Another great addition to this car is its a/c and heat.  The Sentra warms up or shoots out cold out at your request.  I have felt heat coming out of the vents in 20 degree weather in less than 30 seconds.  I have felt a/c almost immediately.  

This car also has a great transmission.  I have an automatic.  When you floor the car to get ahead of someone, or speed up on the entrance ramp, the transmission does not throw the car or wing your head back like in a gravitron or something.  The change in gears is extremely smooth, and light to the senses.

This car even has a cup holder that pulls out from the center dash console...these are handy needless to say.

The only thing I have found wrong with this car so far, is if you do not screw the gas cap on tight enough, your check engine light will come on.  But at least it is being cautious.

I highly recommend this car.  If you are looking around, stop here.  It's a winner.  Did I mention it gets 38 mpg???<br><br>
