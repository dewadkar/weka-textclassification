            My wife and I took European delivery of a Black on Black 330i in June 2001.  Options included Sport Package, Xenons, Moonroof, CD, etc.  

Our dealer, Bluegrass BMW in Paducah, Kentucky did a fabulous job of setting up the process.  Parenthetically, this is a first rate auto dealership that, by virtue of its quality people and fair pricing, sells BMWs to individuals throughout the U.S.  

It is difficult to understand why so few people take advantage of BMW's Euro delivery program.  First, we saved money, enough money to pay for a part of the trip.  Second, it gives you a chance to experience the car in the environment for which it was designed (and at the speeds it was designed to achieve!).  

Delivery at the factory was a snap.  The factory rep did a superb job of introducing us to our new car and we were on our way in an hour.

We had read (on this website) a number of comments that we were anxious to verify.  First, we read a number of comments critical of the stereo system.  When our car was built, BMW had just made the Harmon-Kardon system standard for the 330i.  Whatever you might read elsewhere, this is a terrific system.  No, it cannot produce the mind-numbing volumes of the after-market system in my wife's car.  Even so, what we like in the Harmon-Kardon is its combination of fine bass and a certain smooth "integratedness".  It is truly a stereo "system" with all components selected and placed in a way to delivery great sound to all occupants.  I had intended (before hearing it) to replace the system.  I wouldn't even consider doing so now.  

We had also read (not on this site) that the clutch in the 330i was "notchy" between 1st and 2nd.  Not true, at least not with ours.

Finally, I had read various complaints that the car is a bit too refined to be worth of the name BMW.  After spending the last three years being absolutely beaten up in my (former) 1998 Cobra, I am delighted to finally drive a car that has some refinement.
