            Forgive me if I wax sentimental during this review, folks.  I'm afraid that all the begging, pleading, and yelling out by the F-body fans has fallen on deaf ears at the General.  As of 2002, the Chevrolet Camaro will cease to exist as a new car.

This saddens me greatly, because I've always wanted to own a Camaro.  It's just that no matter what I do, they've always been just slightly out of reach.

The most recent example came when I had the opportunity to test-drive one of these machines.  It lived up to my expectations and then some.
The model I tested was the base Camaro coupe for 2000.  It was equipped with the lower-level engine, GM's venerable 3800 Series II V-6, producing slightly over 200 HP.  It was mated to GM's four-speed automatic with overdrive, powering the rear wheels.  Stepping on the gas even in the &quot;weaker&quot; engine produces more than enough thrust to motivate this car, as evidenced by the skid-marks I left on the dealer's lot, and in the salesan's underwear.  I was not expecting that much go from such a &quot;small&quot; engine, and I was more than impressed.  The exhaust note is relatively quiet at idle, without being luxury-car quiet.  One rap on the loud pedal, however, will easily give you an audible reminder of what lurks under that long, beautiful hood.  Acceleration is strong all through the rev range, providing ample power for passing on the highway.  Yet this engine is fairly tame, and quite happy to cruise at a low RPM on the interstate.

The Camaro has a much more forgiving ride than most sportscars, and is somewhat better than some cars I've owned in the past.  While not isolating you from the potholes and such in the road, it does a good job of soaking up most minor road irregularities.  Should the need (or want) arise, the suspension is quite capable of supporting this car through the twisties with little worry.  Like most rear-drive cars, it's prone to oversteer if it gets out of hand, and the live rear axle in back doesn't help matters any.  However, it's not a completely unforgiving car, and is fairly capable even in the hands of a hamfisted amateur like myself.  Just don't get too cocky behind the wheel.

Along with the handling are the brakes, and in this respect, the car performs quite admirably.  The vehicle I had was equipped with discs at all four corners, and has standard ABS, for short, controlled, reliable stopping power.  This thing could stop on a dime, and in an emergency, it may need to.  Should you not be able to stop in time, the Camaro also has dual front airbags, in case of the worst.

The interior of the car is well-designed.  The controls are fairly basic.  Large, easy to grab knobs for the climate control help when you're trying to turn on the air conditioning to full blast, or cranking the impressive stereo system.  The vehicle I had had the CD and tape deck both in the oversized GM head unit, and sounded very good, if a bit distorted at high volumes.  A good set of aftermarket speakers would solve this problem, however.  

The seats are quite comfortable, but mounted low.  However, despite this, I had no trouble getting into or out of the car.  Headroom was a big surprise.  Even with T-tops, I had more than enough above me for comfort, and there was plenty of legroom for my six-foot frame.  The cockpit is very driver-oriented, and all the controls are within easy reach.

Visibility is a serious problem with this car.  It's got a huge blind spot, and the side mirrors are too small, making it tough to see what you're doing.  While I understand this is a sportscar, that doesn't mean you don't need to see what's going on.

There was only one thing keeping me from purchasing this car right then and there: Price.  Although the Camaro may be a great performance bargain, it gets very expensive very fast.  The model I tested was fairly well-equipped, and tipped the scales at over $22,000.  This was out of my budget, and sadly I could not purchase this splendid auto.

The Camaro is a part of American history, whether we like it or not.  Kids like me have dreamed of owning one for a couple of generations now, but sadly, I'm afraid ours will be the last generation to get some fresh ones.

There is still a glimmer of hope in this dark tale.  Rumors are circulating that GM may bring back the Camaro, as Ford did the Thunderbird.  It is expected to be more like the first-generation coupe, rather than the contemporary sportscar it has evolved into.  It will have a retro look, possibly have V8, rear-wheel-drive power, and may be based on GM's new large-car platform, called Sigma.  If this happens, you can expect a premium price for this retro-rod, putting it out of reach of the people who want it most.

If this isn't good enough for you, there is one other slim chance.  The Pontiac Firebird, the Camaro's mechanical twin, may survive.  Strong sales of the Trans Am model (the equivalent to the Z28) have made GM execs think about sparing its life.  If this happens, then maybe, just maybe, they'll spare the Camaro, too.<br><br>
