            This Jeep is one of the best vehicles ever placed in the production line.  I love driving this car I have so many fun times with it.  The four wheel drive on this car keeps me on the road during the snow.  One thing you got to remember when you drive this car in snow: it won't drive well on ice as with every car.  Oh well ice shmice.  If I had to choose any vehicle in snow driving it would be the Jeep Wrangler and then the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The Grand Cherokee combines luxury with SUV and makes a perfect car.  Well as I finish this opinion, I leave with you this final thought &quot;I before E except after C and some more stuff after that&quot;  TOODLES!!!!!<br><br>
