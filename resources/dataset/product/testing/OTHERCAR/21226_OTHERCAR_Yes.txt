            I feel so dirty. I try to clean myself, but the fowl stench of conformity just won�t wash off. I hope my gearhead friends from highschool don�t read this. Never, did I think that I would find myself recommending a Toyota Camry to anyone, but here we are. I draw inspiration for my articles from actual experience, so since I recently had a satisfying Camry experience, I feel compelled to share the real deal with the buying public. My poor friend Sara is still having extreme difficulties with her 01� model RAV4, and every time it goes into the shop, she is loaned a neutral over neutral, 2000 model Camry. I have been privy to a bit of passenger time in the new model and have been reluctantly impressed.  I also have logged a bit of time in an 87� LE, 88� Base model, and in 92� LE and SE model Camrys through various past girlfriends and their families. My opinion of the car has consistently been that it is a very solid and reliable machine, with no detectable soul. I still, more or less stand by my opinion, however, I feel I must speak out because what the Camry does do well, it does better than almost anyone.

Introduced as a 1983.5 model, the Camry was a front drive successor to Toyota�s long running, mid range Corona. A four-door sedan and liftback were available, both featuring a 2.0 liter, 92 horsepower, in-line 4 cylinder. A turbo diesel was initially offered but proved very unpopular. The Camry enjoyed a successful 1987 restyle, in line with Toyota�s new premium Cressida. The wheelbase remained the same, but additional length and weight were added. The liftback was replaced by a 5-door wagon. Engine displacement was also unchanged but a new, advanced multivalve, DOHC design replaced the old SOHC and 20 horsepower were gained. 5 and 4-speed gearboxes were again offered. All-Trac all wheel drive as well as a V6 soon became available. While the smartly styled second generation felt a little BMW about the edges, the third generation in 1992 took on a completely unique, but very unimaginative monochromatic appearance.  A coupe did appear, though to spice things up. For the 1997 model year, the fifth generation Camry hit the streets, and still serves us today.
 
The current generation Camry has been a marvelous seller for Toyota. This is even despite the sometimes-questionable dollar/content ratios. For the average American, it�s easy to see why. The Camry I most recently experienced was a lower end LE, with a 4-cylinder engine and 4-speed automatic transmission. The cost was in the early twenties and was stocked with an acceptable amount of comfort and convenience features. It was, however missing aluminum rims, fog lamps, power seats, and leather upholstery. Exterior styling was dull (more on this later) and the wheelcovers stuck out from the tire so far, that brushes with curbs had scuffed them all very badly. The interior was highly bland and monotone, though space was good (38.6 inches of front headroom) and everything felt very solid and high end. The power window switches moved with a distinctive click and sent the window up and down with little hesitation. The seats were firm but comfortable and everything was in ideal reach. On the road, the Camry feels to be carved from a single piece of metal. Under heavy acceleration, the little four cylinder moved the Camry along swiftly and without a hint of strain. In fact it felt like a bit more than 136 horses.  Power was very smooth and performance linear. By this I mean you simply point the Camry, and shoot, the car does the rest. The optional V6 engine with 194 horsepower delivers terrific 0-60 times in 7.8 seconds. Get yourself the LE V6 with the standard 5-speed and the time gets down right close to 7 seconds. Stick with the automatic and be treated to almost unpalpable and perfectly timed shifts. The ABS equipped Camry broke quite well too, returning 60-0 in roughly 130 feet. As good as these figures sound, though, the Camry is so quiet and so well mannered that it almost feels like you are sitting still and the world moves around you. Road isolation is so good that the car is completely unentertaining to drive.  Especially with the automatic, the Camry doesn�t let you feel as if you are participating in the driving much at all. Enthusiast drivers take heed. Styling is subjective, but I have been opposed to the way this car looks from day one. To begin with, the car bares an uncanny resemblance to the Alfa Romeo 164.  I am not suggesting impropriety on the part of Toyota, as I see no value in plagiarizing such an odd looking car to begin with. But the tail, nose, and upsweep of the belt line don�t lie. This is especially noticeable when applied to a car of similar size and proportion. If Toyota did �draw inspiration� from the Italians, they didn�t do it very well. Cars today often are styled with character lines sweeping up from the front to give an aggressive stance, or tapering down toward the trunk to lend an elegant tail. Both philosophies are attractive in their own way, but should be combined only with great care. Crimps in the Camry�s sheet metal and beltline characteristics tend to sweep up like the Alfa. But instead of terminating in a tight, high, angular tail, the upper bodylines break over beneath the C-pillar and try to terminate down into the trunk like the exiting model Infiniti Q45. Also, the upper body sweep line and belt level break-over line are at serious odds with one another because one is straight and sweeping, while the other is an irregular compound curve. The whole effect makes the Camry seem unsure of how it wants to look. The styling wants to be all things to all people and yet commit to nothing � much like the rest of the car. Toyota has made some subtle changes to improve the car�s dowdy and uncooperative looks through more dramatic head and tail lamps and larger, more stylish rims, but the core problems are still there.

Competition in this class is fierce, in a strange sort of way. Everyone tries to aggressively excel. However, nobody seems to want to overstep their bounds too much as it might tip their hand that their product may come up short in some hidden way.  If you are considering a Camry, you may also want to look at the Honda Accord, Mazda 626, Nissan Maxima, and Chrysler Sebring. There are many other products available in this market, for sure, but these are the only ones that I feel pose any direct threat to the Camry. These models are the only ones that can compete in terms of price, quality, content, and lifestyle. The 626 is the least competitive, serving up less interior space, and less in the way of refinement, power and performance � but also less in the way of cost. The Maxima has for years, been somewhat of a wildcard in that it presents itself as the budget sports sedan, instead of the budget family sedan. If you would rather pass than be passed, think Maxima. But for conservative daily duties, the Nissan�s talents are not as well utilized. Removing the periphery characters leaves us with the three key players.  The Accord simply goes through the motions each model year. The formula is so ideal that (with the possible exception of the Camry) Honda doesn�t really care what anyone else is doing. The Camry acts in much the same way. Chrysler, seemingly the new kid on the block in this market, is the exact opposite. The new Sebring sedan (and sister Dodge Stratus) has been designed to cautiously pace the Accord and Camry step for step. For example, in terms of size, all three are nearly identical, offering similar interior and trunk space. All three offer small displacement, light-weight, DOHC four cylinder and V6 engines, returning almost identical power and performance figures, and all three price out similarly (though the Chrysler is clearly the value champ).

So, which on is right for you? Well, all three are excellent, on this you have my word. But all three attack the same field in slightly different ways, by bringing something unique to the table. The Accord is more inclined to performance, of the three. The Honda returns marginally better overall numbers on the road, and seems to track better and sportier. Also, ergonomics tend to favor this concept. The Toyota brings comfort to the table, as ride compliancy and road isolation seem to be its strong points. The Chrysler, while competent in both areas, seems to stand out in terms of style. Chrysler�s confident lines and classy nostalgic details make the Sebring feel richer than the other two. Plus, the Sebring has the best dollar/content ratio of all considered.

Regardless of your personal preference, the Camry will be able to cover the spread with ease. Its greatness, though, lies in the fact that everything about the Camry, be it size, power, handling, engineering, comfort, or whatever, is in perfect balance. I have always felt that my wife�s Chrysler Lebaron had just a little too much torque for the steering to deal with. This fact sets off a chain reaction that affects the handling, which in turn affects the ride, which in turn affects the interior comfort level, which in turn affects my over all experience in the car. A lot of vehicles do that, especially when companies put parts in cars that shouldn�t be there. For example, Ford�s Duratec V6 is a marvel in the Contour, but a joke when applied to the hefty new Mazda MPV. When you romp on the gas in a Camry, all the other workings of the car seem to be prepared for it, and may even appear to have been anticipating it. The Camry�s execution of your commands is completely unobtrusive, too. You never feel like the engine is straining, or the suspension is overburdened, or even flicking a switch too hard may break it. Throw whatever you want at the Toyota, it seems to be able to take it.
I truly believe that the key to the Camry�s success, is not what it does, but what it doesn�t do. To drive the Camry you will feel that nothing special is happening. But, there in lies the beauty. After a few miles you begin to notice that all the little things that have annoyed you about other cars you have driven, simply aren�t there. The Camry isn�t beautiful; but then again, it�s no Pontiac Aztek.  The interior isn�t interesting, but everything is exactly where you need it. The performance isn�t great, but the car gets you where you need to go plenty quickly and without ever breaking a sweat. The technology isn�t ground breaking, but a Camry will never leave you stranded, and will last forever. The truth of the matter is that the Camry appears so unimaginative that it is completely non-offensive to everyone. It does what it does, and never pretends to be anything more or less. Little about the Camry, I would call great, but it does absolutely everything well with utter consistency. In my book, that is good enough to break the bell curve in this competitive class and rocket the Camry to number one. The Camry�s willingness to conform to whatever lifestyle you see fit, and do it so well, is simply remarkable. I, like some of you out there, want a car that is an inspiration. When I rip my face off the Sealy every morning to the sometimes drudgery of life, I can smile just a bit, knowing that in the garage, a little excitement waits in the form of an entertaining commute in my very engaging, high performance sports sedan. That said, I would likely never own a plain vanilla Camry. However, despite my concerns about its personality or styling, I reluctantly give this car my seal of approval. You see, I believe that after years of shoddy domestic offerings and overpriced European fluff, this nation has asked for a simple car that will allow them to live their lives however they choose, never let them down, and never get in the way.  Toyota is one of the few that have truly responded. 
Ask, and ye shall receive.
