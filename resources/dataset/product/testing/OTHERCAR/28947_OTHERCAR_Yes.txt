            I love my Rodeo Sport. 

I have a bright blue 4wd V6 hard top. After 2 years, I still cannot stop looking at it and admiring it. The exterior styling is beautiful and rugged at the same time. The fat silver overfenders give it a mean stance and a bulldog look. Who ever heard of 2 sunroofs? I see other drivers going by and taking a second look. "Did I see 2 sunroofs sticking up?" The tires are big and rugged and can go anywhere. I've climbed a few mountains and played in a few mud puddles. The short wheelbase provides predictable and tight handling.

The interior is truck-ish and rugged looking. The speedometer and instrument panel are white in the daytime and appear black at night. Very sleek. Cup holders are abundant and buttons are intuitive. The ONLY downfall to this entire vehicle is getting into the backseat. It's not too easy, but then again, not too hard. Just like getting into a raised 2-dr car. I usually have my backseat folded down anyway. My RoSpo came with the 6 disc in-dash CD player, power windows, locks. The stereo sounds GREAT. Great sound for a stock system. I was kind of surprised. 

As for performance, give it some gas and you're gone. I read somewhere that the Rodeo Sport has slingshot passing capabilities. I couldn't describe it better myself. It passes like a sports car. Never had a single problem. 10 year/100,000 mi warranty.

Tiny tiny cons: The sunroofs aren't automatic. The rear mounted tire is semi-view-obstructing as are the headrests on the backseats. It just takes some getting used to. Makes you more aware of your surroundings anyway, right? Short wheel base makes bumps a little bumpy.

Overall, I refuse to complain. I wish I could buy these little SUVs in bulk so I could have one for the rest of my life.
