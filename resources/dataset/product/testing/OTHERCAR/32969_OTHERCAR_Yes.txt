            I bought my wife a 1997 Camry LE w/leather and wood trim. We have 2 kids and needed good room but the main thing was quality and reliabilty. We had a Chrysler T/C minivan. Not good. 

I wanted a V-6, but the cost was prohibitive. So, we settled on this car. I owned a '91 V-6 and really liked the car; we got many quality miles out of it. We paid $17,900 for our Camry and consider that a reasonable sum; but don't expect any big discounts on any Camry-people want them!

Camrys show their Lexus heritage everytime you get in one. All controls work seemlessly-they have a quality feel to them-not cheap. Except, for 2 places in the interior that Toyota seems to have decontented. The radio knobs feel cheap, cheap, cheap, the release pull for the hood feels as though its going to break anytime you pull it. Unusual for a Toyota. The remainder of the car is substantial feeling. The ride is that of a $35,000 Lexus (hushed and well isolated); it handles reasonably well and sight lines are excellent. We got the 2.2L 4 cyl. and while no Corvette on acceleration, it is more than adequate and really pays off while passing those fuel pumps. We have had nary an problem w/the car (and don't expect to) in 5,000 miles of driving. 

The lights illuminate the road better than any car I've ever had (incl. MB). Backseat room is adequate, not luxurious and trunk room is great for a midsize vehicle. The seats are very firm and are great for hour or less trips, more than this they begin to make your back hurt. Other Camry owners concur. Buy the car if you want good, reliable transportation that's basically invisible.<br><br>
