            The 1992 Mazda 323 is a great little car.  Even after seven years on the road, it requires only routine maintenance.  Of course, it is not the largest nor the most powerful car on the road, it is perfectly adequate for the practical driver who is not interested in trying to impress other drivers. My model does not have air conditioning which is, naturally, a drawback in our hot, humid Florida summers.  Since most of my driving is on the highway, I don't really miss it and consider the increased gas efficiency worth the sacrifice.  This small car is not for someone who needs a lot of leg room but is large enough for drivers and passengers of normal height and weight.  Also, the car is so light that the breeze from passing trucks can be felt.<br><br>
