            Purchased new for a family of 6 in 1994.  Difficult getting into the rear seat.  Kids don't seem to mind but adults have a tough time getting in and out of the rear seat.  Roomy except for the back.  Got the tow package for pulling a large boat and this has worked out surprising well.  Engine is strong and starts like clock work.

Had to replace the transmission at 70,000.  Rear, side, electric operated windows failed to open or close at about 15,000.  Van is very noisy inside.  Utility drawer under passenger front seat is flimsy and won't close.  Very difficult to remove back two bench seats (heavy and bulky).  The sliding door is heavy and the rollers are difficult to oil and don't roll smoothly.<br><br>
