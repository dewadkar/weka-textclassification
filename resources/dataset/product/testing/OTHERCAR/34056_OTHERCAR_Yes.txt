            In 1998, My wife and I were looking for a car to replace the 90 Pontiac Bonneville that was given to us and on it's last legs... we didn't do much looking around, and we lucked out when we found out that Chrysler would finance us with a cosigner. I, being attracted to bigger cars of yesteryear like 80's Cadillacs, was drawn to the Intrepids and bigger cars on their lot, but we saw our Forest Green Neon with 29k miles, still clean, inside and out. Our Neon is the DOHC Automatic Sport model with 4 doors, power locks, and manual windows (power windows weren't put on the Neons until 97).

In the beginning of 1999, our Neon wouldn't start, even though it was garaged, evidently sludge and water had gotten into the throttle body and had froze, requiring getting it cleaned, a $125 job at the dealership. 

It's two years later, we still have another 2 years to go in paying it off, and it now has over 82k miles. We just got it out of the shop last week to get the head replaced and a few other things. 

The biggest problem with the 95-96 Neons, from what I've seen and heard, is that under normal/rigorous driving, the head gasket and/or head needs to be replaced around 60-80k miles. The head is made of aluminum, which tends to get much hotter than regular steel heads, and in turn, kills the head gasket because of the heat. The head gasket, when it goes, usually leaks coolant into the oil, and robs performance because the engine gets hotter and the oil doesn't do it's job as well. This results in the engine burning off coolant, which you can see as white smoke from the tailpipe when stopped or taking off from a stop, and you can also distinctly smell the steam from it. I've heard the same story from 3 or 4 people regarding the head and head gasket, and there's not much you can do about it but get it fixed and foot the bill for it. Ours cost about $650, and took about a day to fix. If you already own a Neon and will need to have this done, specify the type of engine (SOHC or DOHC) so the mechanic will know which head to order, and keep the receipt in a safe place in case Chrysler issues a national recall, you'll be reimbursed for the full amount. (hopefully.) 

After the work was done, I've noticed a lot of lost performance has been restored; it's peppier on the street and on the highway. 

Here's some other problems I've run into: 

1. Gas gauge sensor or float has gone bad, making the gas gauge unreliable in the car. I'm not paying $300 to have a mechanic pull the gas tank to fix this, I can measure the amount of gas from the trip odometer. 

2. Valve cover gasket O-rings not sealing completely, causing oil leakage into the spark plug wells, ultimately resulting in spark plug failure. Luckily this never happened on the road, but I replaced the valve cover gasket twice, and still got the leakage and had to keep an eye on the spark plugs. It's since been fixed, but I realize this was partially 
my fault. 

3. Radio getting power surges/losing time. This recently started happening, and is a bit aggravating since I don't wear a watch. :P 

4. Brake squeal. I'm not sure why this is, but the 2 times I've replaced the brakes, rotors, and drums, it's quiet for the first 1000 miles, but gets a high pitched squeak when stopping. I've used disc brake quiet liberally on the pads, and I still don't know why this is. 

Another small con is the engine noise on the highway. around 65-75 MPH, the engine is very noticable, I'd guess because of the cab forward design. I've heard the noise isn't as bad in the Breeze/Stratus', because of the extra engine space, even though they're the same engine. 

One nice thing, the oil is easy to change with even the scissorjacks, even easier with a normal jack, and is possible without even jacking it up (it's a tight fit, however.) 

After all is said and done, I have to say that the Neon is still a good car, maintenance hasn't been completely absurd, and it could be a lot worse. It's still a fun car to drive... not sluggish in handling and acceleration like most Fords, and it feels a little better than a Chevy Cavalier. The interior is comfortable, although it takes a little getting used to the blind spot right over your left shoulder when you're driving, and on sunny days, the dashboard is reflected on the inside windshield, being a bit of a nuisance. I'm also dismayed at the depreciation value. Sad that a decent car like this has to depreciate so quickly. 

If you're not looking to spend much and have found a Neon with low miles for a good price against the bluebook, pick it up. If you have a little more to spend, you might consider a Saturn, just because I've been a little unimpressed with the Chrysler dealership keeping tabs on how the car is doing and keeping a good repoire. <br><br>
