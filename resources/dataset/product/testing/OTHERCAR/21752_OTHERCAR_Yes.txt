            I have had my Cavalier for 3 years now and I can say, I have been pretty satisfied with its performance and look. I bought this car while in college because I needed a reliable car that would not break down on me while I drove to visit my parents 250 miles each way. The Cavalier has delivered for me! 

In 3 years, I put on 50,000 miles and she's still going strong. I have only replaced the tires and brakes recently (around 42000 and 50000 respectively) and those vary based on where and how you drive. The only other problem I experienced was with the drivers side seat. i had to have it serviced 3 times in the past year but it has been good for about 5 months now. 

Aside from those things, the Cavalier has never given me any problems. Its a pretty smooth ride for a low end car, but it lacks the power I would like it to have. I bought a pretty stripped down version because I was a college student so I was lacking a few things. But that was my fault not theirs. Aside from this being a low end car, there are still plenty of ways to soup this car up. They do have the Z24 version available which offers a powerful V6 engine and an even sportier look. They have very up-to-date colors inside and out and the car seems to be we made. It can have cruise, power windows, locks, and steering, CD Player, and many other addable options. 

This car is not meant to be a family car or a large group car, this is evident by the back seat. Adults will be very cramped, especially if there is anyone over 5'8" driving. If you plan on having others in the car with you very often, this car is not the way to go because they will be cramped in the back. That aside, compared with the other cars in its class, I would say the Cavalier is definitly one of the winners. 

In retrospect, put in the same situation, I would definitly buy the Cavalier once again...I hope you do the same.

Update:
In the past months I have still found myself happy with this car despite having to have my drivers seat fixed numerous times. The Chevy dealership has backed themselves up numerous times so I will not say anything bad regarding their service. My tires lasted for about 47,000 miles and my brakes for about 52,000 before they needed to be replace which was nice. Its still a great low end car, but I plan on upgrading in the following months!! I have experienced a downside of the Cavalier though...its somewhat difficult to sell. The market is pretty small for a used low-end car. Its amazing just how un-powerful the car was when you compare it to my new car. Again, for its market...this is a great car to buy!
