            First of all, I am biased.  I love this car.  I looked at a few others in this category, namely the BMW 328i, and the Lexus GS400.

The A4 comes with two available engine sizes and trim options.  The 1.8T is the less expensive of the two, while the 2.8 costs a little more.

The first thing that attracted me to the A4 was its substantial 190 hp normally aspirated V6.  The acceleration is smooth and constant, no doubt due to the amazing 5 valves per cylinder ( 30 total ), and there is always power available, even upwards of 90 mph.  This powerful engine alone distinguishes it from the BMW's relatively pedestrian 16-valve inline 4 engines that it uses in the 3-series.  

Another great feature that I had to have was Audi's famous Quattro AWD system.  It was Audi's Quattro system that got them disqualified from the World Rally Championship in the early 80s, as it presented an unfair advantage.  You get the benefits of this unfair advantage, as the Quattro system offers flawless performance under any conditions.  I found the A4 to be just as at home in the snow and slush as it is on the freeway.  Quattro is a must-have for anyone who enjoys winter sports or lives in a place that has sever winter weather.  Quattro also helps on the freeway at speed, as it digs in and accelerates quickly. An optional winter weather package offers heated door locks, mirrors and a ski bag that extends out from the back seat arm rest.

Overall, I found that the A4 had more standard equipment than the others, and the interior was much nicer than any of the others, which I felt contained too much plastic and vinyl to justify their price tags.  Leather seats and wood paneling accent the ergonomically designed cockpit.  The dashboard layout is clean and intuitive, and a nice touch are the turn signal, wiper and headlight controls are a set of levers, as opposed to rotating knobs, which always drive me crazy.  The red backlighting is weird at first, but then you're thankful because the instruments won't mess with your night vision.

Safety features are all there, of course, and the 5 speed manual transmission that I selected is substantial and very snappy, although the long-throw clutch pedal takes a little getting used to.

The standard issue sound system is, unfortunately, appalling, as are most sound systems that come with European cars.  If you want, you can order a Bose sound system package, but I opted instead to replace the sound system with a much better aftermarket system.  I'm a stereo nut, so perhaps the standard sound system will be satisfactory for most people.

Overall, the A4 is a German sedan that offers terrific performance and style, and definitely outshines its nearest competition, the BMW 3 series, and fully loaded, still comes in with a lower price tag by far than a BMW without any options.  ( US$32k for the A4 vs. US$36k for the 328i)<br><br>
