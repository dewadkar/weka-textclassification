            What a big tall SUV. I might say, the design needs to be improved. A bit sluggish and should bring a V-8 engine standard. Breaks pretty good and you can stuff a bunch of stuff in the back. Pretty good offroad, but I haven't tried it on serious bad stuff. Really cool seats in front, great stuff and items many suvs do not bring usually, many hidden compartments, and it steers nicely. This cars feels slow though. When your going 60 it feels like 40 or even 30mph. It brings super heavy duty shocks so you feel every bump and hard! The integrity could be better but it's not bad. Better than many cars. The seats in the back have leg room but only 2 average size adults fit fine. 3 is a crowd. Those seats are narrow, just like the car. The height it considerebly high, and the width is too little for it's size. The ground clearance makes it worst. That's why the car brings heavy duty shocks or else it will tip over! Personally they should re-design the car a bit. I would make it a bit shorter in height and a bit wider. Then put a nice V-8 engine. This car is pretty good for going from point A to B. The back view could be better(thanks to the nice tire and small window it has). Should improve integrity plus add more stuff! The SUV also leans quite a bit in turns and it feels like your going to tip over, but my friend took his and did a 180, so I think there's a chance there. It's also a bit unstable at high speeds. You could loose control easily in wet roads, easier than usual.<br><br>
