            I purchased a 1996 Cirrus from my grandfather in October of 1999, it had only 35,000 miles when I purchased it.  Since then I have invested over $3,000 in servicing the car, $2,200 just in A/C work alone.  I have had the transmission serviced, the airbag light come on, anti-lock brakes trigger when pulling into a parking space, car won't start when gas tank gets to 1/4 tank, sometimes the gas gauge won't work, have to stop and restart the car for it to show a full tank of gas.  It is a fun car to drive and I have had more complements on the looks of this car than any other car I have owned.  It handles nicely and has lots of room.  All the service issues though made me wish I had bought something else.  I would not recommend this as a car to by to anyone because of the constant service problems I have had. Chrysler has offered to pay for the parts if I paid the labor on many occasions since the car is not under the warranty, but has low mileage.  Still not acceptable the amount of service problems it has.
