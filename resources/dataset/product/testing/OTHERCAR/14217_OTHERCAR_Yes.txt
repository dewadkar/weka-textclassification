            When I hear the name Casio, I immediately say� Don't they make watches??  Yes they do and several other electronic goodies as well.  This time, I think they finally have a quality product. <i>(I stress I THINK)</i>

This is one of many of my Digital Camera Series that I will be reviewing this April.
I feel I am highly qualified to review digital cameras as I have worked with them for three years now and use them on a daily basis.

If you need info on a specific camera feel free to email me, and I�ll help you best I can.

<b> Quick Comments:</b>

When I first entered the digital camera fray a few years back, I found several casio's on the market.  My first instinct was that they should stick to electronic stopwatches. The junk they were putting out back then was appalling.  Up until recently, I continued with that opinion.  The new 2000UX has changed my mind for the time being and I think Casio finally has a decent addition to the DC arena.

<b> <i> Camera Details: </i> </b>

Max Resolution � 1600x 1200  (2.1 megapixel)
Autofocus (via contrast)
4 Mode Flash on, off, low, outdoor
Compact Flash � CF Type II
File formats:  AVI, JPEG, DCF, DPOF

<b> <i> What I liked: </i> </b>

The storage availability!  The Casio can use the new IBM microdrives allowing up to 340 Megs of picture storage.  Decent control set and fairly easy to use, with advanced features not hard to access or grasp.  High Resolution ability.  The Casio allows me to control Aperture and shutter speeds!  USB connectivity allows for super fast downloads to my computer (when not swapping CF cards)

<b> <i> What I disliked: </i> </b>

Deleting pictures is a major pain in the butt!  I can�t wait for a camera to come out with a one-touch delete button.  The auto lens cover takes too long to open at camera start up (yes, I am THAT impatient) Battery use; this thing sucks the juice down in record time!  Ughhh!  How I hate having to �recharge� things.

(This is speculative) Quality of design and longevity.  Casio has ALWAYS let me down, every watch I have ever bought has failed or broken, and after one day with this camera, there were about 10 mysterious scratches on the unit.  I say mysterious because I do not remember banging it around.  And there was a tiny scratch on the lens itself when I opened the box.


<b> <i> Extra Features: </i> </b>

User Aperture and shutter speed control.  Burst photos, which allow up to 6 rapid fire (1/2 second) shots.  You are able to hook up the camera to a TV to view actual images or �live� shots; you can even record these on a VCR for a low quality picture show.
Low light and Night time capabilities.  This camera does really well with night shots, out performing my Kodak 290.

<b> <i> Who is this camera for: </i> </b>

Someone looking for a higher resolution that the �standard� of today who would like to get into some advanced digital camera techniques, and/or the need for higher storage for prolonged use of the camera before �downloading� GREAT for a vacation!

<b> <i> Value: </i> </b>

With DC�s coming down in price every day, I do not see the Casio as an extremely great deal.  The features are nice, but not exclusive and there are better cameras on the market for around the same price point. (Olympus and Kodak)


<b> Bottom Line:  </b>

Nice design overall, shoots really nice pictures, comes with two storage options and USB.  

Even with all that I would still go with a Kodak camera (the 280 0r 290) over this Casio if you have the extra $50.00 or so.  Maybe I am biased, or have a precognition, but something has always nagged me about Casio from a quality standpoint.  Don�t expect this unit to last the test of time.  But if you are a super careful type person and want some cool features, take a shot, but wait a month or so for the price to drop.
