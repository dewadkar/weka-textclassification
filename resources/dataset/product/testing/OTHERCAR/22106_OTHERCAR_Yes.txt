            I bought this digital camera to use when I was a professional photographer for an Internet travel site. I needed a small, professional-quality unit that would allow me to have easy and fast uploading ability. The DC215 was an excellent choice.

For Internet pictures, this camera can't be beat. It allows the user to choose quality levels, and with the included software you can alter the photos to suit your needs. The picture quality is excellent, and the photos look equally good when printed. I have used this camera for professional shoots, as well as for auction listings and I am very happy with this purchase. It is a great camera for someone with no photography experience as well as someone who knows the ins and outs of photography. The LED window on the back is a must-have feature, though it does get a bit smudged with fingerprints, but that is only an annoyance and not anything to do with the performance of this great little camera. <br><br>
