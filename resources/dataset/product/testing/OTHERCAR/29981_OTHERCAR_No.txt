            I thought it important to let you all know that the Dodge Caravan has a fundamental flaw.  We have owned 2 of them &amp; have had the same problems with both.  The flaw is that when they get over 120,000 miles on them, the transmission begins giving you trouble and will eventually go out.  If you are the type of person that buys a vehicle new, drives it a couple of years, then trades it off for another new vehicle, that flaw probably won't concern you much.  But if you are the type of person who drives a vehicle a long time, puts a lot of miles on a vehicle or buys a used vehicle I would suggest that you think hard about choosing a Caravan. I don't know if the other minivans have the same problem as the Caravan, but I do know from personal experience that Caravan has this problem.  Don't get me wrong, Caravans do have their good points.  They are very easy to drive and they are great if you have a family.  And they new ones even have 4 doors instead of 3 making it easier to get in &amp; out of the back seats.  I don't know about the newest ones, but our '94 Caravan has the front seats a little too close to the doors.  If you are a small or medium built person, it won't bother you.  But if you are a big person, like my husband is, you might feel crowded.  Like I said though, Caravans have their good points, but after having to replace 2 transmissions in out 86 &amp; our 94, I'm not going to buy another one.<br><br>
