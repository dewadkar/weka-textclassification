If the family needs a new vehicle, the best selection is a minivan, especially if many trips are taken throughout the course of the year.  Although I wouldn't be caught dead in a minivan because I think they are women cars and that men drive trucks (male stereotype I follow :).

The new minivan has front wheel drive but also comes with all wheel drive, depending on your choice.  The models used to be always ES's but now I have seen only SE's and Sport's for these newer minivans made by Dodge.  This might be due to the amount of fancies that have gone into the interior, including the built in Pentium IV computer with cable access internet! (Haha! Just kidding -- you internet access junkies!)

It comes with a V6 engine and this particular model gives the car a lot of kick.  I test drove one of these at the lot to see how it rides, but wasn't considering a purchase because of financial problems, lol, not because I didn't like it or anything.

I have driven a Ford Winstar and I have to say I do prefer this 2001 Dodge Caravan to that because the interior is very comfortable and roomy.  And also "Finally!" a minivan with a thinner and smaller "nose" (that being the front of the car.  With this smaller nose, I found it easier to park, because I could see more of the car in front of me.

A new climate control now allows yourself and the passengers to set the temperatures and ventilation.  So it is great for family members who have contrasting temperature opinions, LOL! "Its cold!" -- "Are you crazy?! Im boiling!"  Tried out the heated front seats; made me feel all cozy as it was freezing this particular day.  What else could you ask for? *Presto*  A Cellphone holder!

The minivan was a great drive and has some great handling.  For the music junkie, the 4 CD stereo is clear and easy enough to use and control while driving.  The sound system is decent.

Going on a trip with bored children? Pull down the videotape player for the kids and avoid hearing "Are we at Granny's yet??!"

The minivan has a 5 year warranty or 60,000 mile warranty and is priced at around $26,000 - $40,000 (40K with all the interior and exterior options)  A decent price for a family minivan.
