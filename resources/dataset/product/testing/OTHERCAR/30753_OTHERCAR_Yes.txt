            I picked up the Olympus D-340R for $275 + tax about 6 months ago.

Are you looking for the right digital camera but can't decide whether to make the investment or just by a sub-par 640x480 camera for the time being? That was the same reason I began my search for the perfect camera(digital) for the perfect price.

At first I needed a camera to just put images on the web(EBay, webpages, etc.)

I tried a few digital cameras I could find for under $100. They worked. That's about all I could say. They could put images on the web for me. But quality was pathetic. Some of my pictures were turning out really bad because I couldn't see them before I uploaded them to my PC. The no LCD thing was beginning to really bug me.

So I searched, and looked at reviews, and everything else I could scour about digital cameras. Then I decided went to an electronics store to check out their display, namely Circuit City. First thing their commission based salesmen did was swarm me as I entered the digital camera section. But I did learn a lot about the Olympus 340R that visit.

It had everything I wanted! LCD, TV-out, 1.3MegaPixel. 8MB removable SmartMedia Card(can hold 120 640x480, 36 1280x960, etc.), from a good brand name, flash, red-eye removal, timer, you name it. It even had a few functions I would have never thought would come with a camera with a price tag of only $275. It had a panoramic function built into it, a burst shutter to take up to 10 pics at half-second intervals, 2x digital zoom, good LCD functions, and it was EASY to use!

But then I thought to myself, this camera is 3 times as much as the other cameras I tried! So then I decided to make the investment. I could use this camera for more than web graphics(even better ones). I could use as my regular 35mm, after all I don't have a 35mm film camera anyways.

I compared it to its competition, namely the FujiFilm MX-1200. No comparison even though the MX-1200 was a bit smaller and more modern looking. The screen was tiny on the MX-1200, and there was no protection for the lens.

So I took the D-340R home after I bought it and wow, I must say, Olympus really put together a nice camera. A few things I didn't like was the look, it looked like every other Olympus camera. I wanted a camera that would be more catchy and modern looking. Also it didn't have a USB interface but only a serial one. It didn't come with an A/C adapter, or carrying case, but it DID come with a strap.

Image quality:
Uses square pixels to reduce breaking up when the picture is enlarged
excellent color reproduction
sharp images
light compensation in dark or bright places
auto focus
macro mode
perfect pictures every time

Software:
Olympus CAMEDIA Master(a few advanced image tools), very easy to use
Enroute Imaging Quick Stitch for panoramic pictures(also easy to use)
Adobe PhotoDeluxe 3.0 HE

A few nice features:
panoramic, with stitching software, really works!
10 image burst shooting
2x digital zoom
1.8&quot; LCD
ease of use
lens protection
multi flash(red eye, fill-in, etc.)
8MB Smartmedia, a lot
fast image capture, no wait between pictures
excellent quality images
no compression mode(1 image = 4 MB)
nice feel in hand
TV-out for non-PC viewing
optional PCMCIA card, or floppy disk adapter to download images
well-built, durable

This is definitely the best camera for the price. You cannot find a digital camera with this many features for less than $500(I got it for $275). If you want a digital camera for only putting things on the web, for selling on auctions, or for similar uses I urge you to make this investment and be able to use it for family pictures and much more than just taking low-quality, dark, and grainy images with a crappy 640x480 camera.<br><br>
