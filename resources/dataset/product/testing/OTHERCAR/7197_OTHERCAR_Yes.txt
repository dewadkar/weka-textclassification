            For an old car, it�s a good car.  I don�t recommend it if it has a lot of mileage, but its great!  Comfortable!  Stylish!  Cute!  I had it in maroon, and I loved it!  The only problem I found was with the radiator.  After a lot of miles, the radiator broke and the car would over heat a lot.  After I got that fixed, it was fine.  A good quality stereo.  Great gas mileage.  A good looking car.  Leather interior is a plus.   I would recommend this car for local driving, but  a car this old would not be great for long distance driving.  I loved it though.  Look into the details before purchasing, but Nissan is a good, reliable brand of car!<br><br>
