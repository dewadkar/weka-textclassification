            We're a small family - 2 adults, one toddler -- so a Suburban isn't the obvious choice...  But I wanted to buy something with high marks for safety &amp; reliability, and my husband wanted an SUV with lots room for dogs, camping gear, friends, etc. - and the Suburban was the obvious choice.  I did informal polling of everyone I could find who owned one, and without exception everyone said &quot;I can't imagine life without it&quot;, &quot;We'll always own a Suburban&quot;, etc, etc.  And they are right, we've grown to love ours so much that I think we'll always have a Suburban in the family.  And why GMC over Chevy?  So petty, but I liked the look of the front grill of the GMC better than Chevy.  Since we got ours last summer, 3 friends/family members have also bought one based on our raves.  We strongly recommend it!<br><br>
