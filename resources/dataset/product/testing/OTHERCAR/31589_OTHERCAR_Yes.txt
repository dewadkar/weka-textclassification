            I received my 800 for Christmas last year, and it's my first venture into digital photography.  I took tons of practice pictures in anticipation of using this camera exclusively on a Disney vacation.  

I bought a bigger memory card (48M vs the 8M it comes with) and several sets of rechargeable batteries.  The rechargeables are really necessary; I was only getting about 50 pictures per set of batteries.  However, I use the LCD viewfinder exclusively and you could probably get several times that number of shots using the optical viewfinder instead.

The camera is very easy to use, and most pictures (75%) taken in the simplest automatic mode come out great.  Most of the failures are caused by a too-weak flash, but retaking a picture with the flash disabled usually has a good outcome.  The colors are generally true and vibrant, the focus is excellent, and it only takes a couple of seconds between shots.  A frequent problem is red-eye, but this is easily editable with the included software, or other image editing package.

While on vacation, I'd upload the pictures from the camera to a laptop via the serial interface.  It's a very slow process (1-2 hours to download the 30-50 pictures I'd take each day) - I'd have liked a faster USB interface.  At home, I have a PC Card drive that gets the images off the memory card in seconds.

Good camera, fun to use, and takes great pictures!  <br><br>
