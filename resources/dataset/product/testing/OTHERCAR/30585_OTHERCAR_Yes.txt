            The 1995 Honda Odyssey is a great van that feels like a car.. With famous Honda quality and attention to detain found through out, this van has proved to be a big hit for Honda.

We got a 1995 Odyssey because it was hard to get a new one (there is a 6 month waiting list) and the price was right.  The can was exceptionally clean, and had all the amenities that we were looking for (seating for 6, sun roof, 4 real doors, and it�s a Honda).

The van is designed on the Honda Accord chassis, and shares the same engine and drive train as the Accord.  The drawback being that only a four cylinder was offered in our year (I do not believe that they have offered a 6 cylinder yet) and this makes the van particularly �gutless� The fold down rear seat is very easy to use and innovative, and the fit and finish as stood up very well over 6 years.

The van offers a comfortable, quiet ride, and is nice to drive. It�s features include: 
Air Conditioning
AM/FM/Cassette Radio
Power Sun Roof
Power Windows
Power Steering
Power Breaks
Four Wheel Disc Breaks
Dual Airbag
Four Captains Seats
Folding rear bench seat (seats 5 and 6)
Great Looking Design
Good Fit and Finish
Good, High Quality Design

Some of the drawbacks (as I see them):
Underpowered engine (only a 4-cylinder)
20 MPG gas milage (OK, I know I want more power and more engine - I didn�t say that this list was exactly logical)			

That�s it.. Usually, in a car, you can come up with a litany of complaints, but these are rather mild, and can be easily lived with. The 1995 Honda Odyssey - a great all around value for the dollar.
