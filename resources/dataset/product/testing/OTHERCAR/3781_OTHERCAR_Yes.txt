            I mean, really, what else would you expect from the BMW name.  Did you really think BMW could ever produce a BAD car? BMW comes through again with the M3, the best car for your buck out there.
The M3 is a great SPORTS car.  This car can handle like you wouldn't believe, even at going at high speeds.  The engine is very strong, and you will feel slow going sixty five in this car.  I have always found BMW to produce cars with exceptional braking, among other things, and this car continues to fuel my opinions.  I first realised how tight and responsive the brakes are as I was slowing to the first stoplight after pulling out of the dealership.
On the inside, the BMW continues to deliver.  I found this car roomy up front, and very fun to drive.  The basic stereo in this car I even found to be pretty good.  In back, it is a little tight for larger adults, but hey, this is a sports car.  Nobody wants to drive in the back anyways.
Plus, the look of this car is one of my favorites from the BMW line.  Sporty yet it maintains a &quot;classy&quot; look.  You can't go wring with this combo.
Overall, this BMW is a great car.  Definately go buy yours today.  Words cannot be used to describe the greatness of this automobile.<br><br>
