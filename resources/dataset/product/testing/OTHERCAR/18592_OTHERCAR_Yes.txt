             	I leased an Alero about five months ago. I have been enjoying it very much ever since. To be honest, I was first attractive to the car by a nice 0 down leasing advertisement in the local newspaper. We need a second family car and we don't have a lot of cash to put as down payment. When we saw the car and test-drove it, we fell in love with it immediately.

      	In my five month experience with this car, there are many obvious advantages I found with this one comparing to our other car: a Toyota Corolla, which in itself was a very good car. Alero is simply more powerful, and have way many features for the leasing price of $250 we pay every month with no money down.

      	Our Alero is six engines with over 150 horsepower. It drives smoothly on the up and down road in the rocky mountain area we live. It has power everything, from door lock to window, from seat adjustment to mirrors, and it has the child safety lock system. The seats are comfort for several hours driving. The trunk size is very good to even hold in a Papson chair frame we just bought, and the back seat is much roomy and wilder than our old Corolla. It also has air bags system, which I hope I never have to use. It has a nice built in theft-proof CD player and nice stereo system. Now I enjoy my CD everyday on the way to and back from work. 

      	What I like most about Alero, is the smooth curve of the body. It makes the car look very smooth, and hide the inside space pretty well. Usually roomy inside means awkward looking outside body shape. But this is not the case for Alero, and indeed I think it's an advantage of Alero. 

     	I would definitely recommend this one to any of my friend. This is not your ordinary type of Oldsmobile car.
