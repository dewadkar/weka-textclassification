            I've had my Integra LS Coupe since March of '99, and after a year and a half of day to day driving, I concluded that I had logged enough hours to write a through, accurate review.

A little bit of history: I had gotten the new car bug back in the beginning of '99, and was looking for a reliable, cop-resistant enthusiast's car for under about $15K. After doing a lot of research and test drives, it looked like I had a winner in either Nissan Sentra SE sedan. It was really fun to drive, with agile handling, a peppy 140hp 2.0L I4 aluminum engine, and strong 4 wheel disc brakes. Plus, a fully loaded Sentra SE could be had for a little over $15K. Unfortunately, it was impossible to find one with a manual transmission, so I'd have to order one and wait 3 months without even being able to test out the shifter for myself. I figured I'd end up buying the runner-up Mazda Protegï¿½ ES, but on a whim, I decided to test out an Acura Integra LS Coupe. It was a little more than I wanted to spend, and although I had been leaning towards a 4 door sedan, the hatchback also appealed to me. So I took a test drive...

I fell in love with the Integra immediately. I was extremely impressed with the dynamics of this car. The steering was firm and nicely weighted, yet very responsive. It offered tactile response without any harshness. The engine, although small and high-strung, was just awesome for a 1.8L I4. It begged to be redlined, and it did it with a smoothness and refinement uncharacteristic of an econo-car. Above 4500 RPM, the Integra's engine came to life, and above 5000, the response was immediate and awesome, with a gutsy, satisfying wail. And this wasn't even the VTEC.  I loved the taut, yet compliant fully independent suspension that somehow allowed the car to bite hard into turns while trail-braking, while sucking up every bump and staying perfectly on track. I was impressed with the brakes, which stopped hard and fast, with good pedal feel. I loved the shifter, which was almost as precise as the one in the NSX on the showroom floor. It made it a joy to keep the peaky little 4 cylinder engine in its powerband. I loved the perfectly tuned clutch, which was almost too easy to modulate. Honda knows how to make a really good transmission.

The interior was very comfortable as well. I initially thought it was cramped, but intimate seems like a better word. The front seats are aggressively bolstered, and are firm and supportive enough for some serious backroad antics. I also appreciated the adjustable (and necessary) lumbar support, which I always keep cranked at its highest setting. The seating position is low, the steering wheel, pedals, and shifter are all placed perfectly, the gauge cluster is racy in its pure utility, and the overall feeling is that of a serious driver's car, considering the bargain price.

Stylistically, the Integra is inoffensive and restrained. It still looked purposeful and sporty, but it wasn't exactly a trendsetter. Some have criticized the round projector style headlamps, but I thought they were a nice, unique touch, and quite frankly, they did a superb job of lighting up the road. I thought it looked great without a spoiler, and the 15&quot; &quot;spider&quot; alloy wheels looked very handsome.

Satisfied that this was the best car for the money, I enthusiastically signed on the dotted line. I loved the Integra during the test drive, but how would I feel after 18 months of ownership?

Here's the reality-

Loves:

I love driving my Vogue Silver Metallic Integra. It begs to be pushed harder and harder. It's quick. Not fast, necessarily, but quick, probably quicker than 80% of the cars on the road. It's probably one of the most satisfying front wheel drive cars out there. It's also extremely comfortable. And when my girlfriend drives it, leaving me in the passenger's seat to relax and unwind, it almost feels luxurious. Almost. Don't let the Acura badge fool you. It's not a luxury car. It's a sporty, mature, refined interpretation of an economy car. In fact, much of the car is based on the previous generation Civic. Still, the build quality is outstanding. The body panels are perfectly aligned, and the interior is finished very well. It feels like a high quality product, and it is. I've taken the Integra on road trips, and the firm seats do wonders to reduce fatigue and leave me ache free. I'm still enamored with the transmission, and the ability to instantly and effortlessly downshift has gotten me out of a few tight situations. Despite stop and go traffic in the Metro DC area, it's worth shifting my own gears just for the times when I can find an unpopulated back road and give my car a workout. I REALLY love the hatchback. I'm now convinced that this car is infinitely more practical than a 4 door sedan. This isn't a subcompact sports coupe; it's the love child of a compact pickup and a sports car. The trunk swallows whatever I can throw at it, and with the rear seats folded down, I can take a trip down to IKEA and take almost anything back home with me. The Integra has singlehandedly convinced me that the sport-wagon concept is a great idea.

Likes: The stock stereo sounds fine. The sound is clean and detailed enough. I like having a moonroof, although when it's open, it's about as big as a mail slot. The central locking is pretty neat too. From any door, including the hatch, I can twist the key and open all the other doors. I would have preferred keyless entry, however. When I lay off the throttle, the Integra rewards me with great gas mileage. But when I mash it, well...

Dislikes: The HVAC system is a bit on the weak side. It takes its sweet time heating and cooling the cabin. The long doors and low seats conspire to make it a pain to get in and out of the car in tight parking situations. Honda also skimped on interior illumination. The moonroof controls, door locks, and window switches aren't illuminated, so you have to grope in the darkness to find them. The cupholders are chintzy and block the power outlet when in use. So if you have a cell phone you can only count on the ability to hold one modest drink. And said drink will also likely bump the radio controls. The illuminated temperature control slider has a poorly offset LED on it, so from the driver's vantage point, it always looks like it's pointing at the wrong setting. The side doors don't feel heavy and meaty, like on a good German car. They're a little &quot;tin-canny&quot;. I also wish there was a little less road noise. New tires would fix this.

Hates: The stock tires are underperformers. They don't adhere well during acceleration (it doesn't help that this is a front wheel drive car), and they give up way before the suspension does. They're awful in the wet, and the little 1.8 liter engine can overpower the tires in low friction situations. This car deserves better, and when it's time to replace the rubber, I'll do it right. The rear seats really suck. Don't put anyone larger than Gary Coleman back there. The center stack is an ergonomic disaster. The radio is too low, and you have to lean to control it. The HVAC controls are a disaster. Give me 3 simple, large rotary dials for temperature, fan speed, and vent configuration, plus a button to toggle the AC. Instead, the Integra makes me deal with chintzy slider to control the temperature, and several identically sized buttons to configure the ventilation. It's unnecessary and entirely too fussy. The center stack storage bin is useless. It's too level, there's no lip, and it isn't lined with rubber, so anything left in it will come shooting out during hard acceleration. The moonroof doesn't have a tilt control, so to tilt the moonroof, you have to play with the switch and catch it in its raised position right before it starts to slide back. Not a very rewarding game.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with my car. I'm very picky, and no car is perfect, so don't let my long negative rants dissuade you. The Integra is a great car and always keeps me smiling when I drive it. It's the perfect car for an enthusiast on a budget who wants performance, cargo carrying versatility, and a vehicle he can depend on. And for a few more bones, you can get the even slicker GS-R with a tighter suspension, a 170hp VTEC engine, and a close ratio gearbox. I highly recommend this vehicle, which is really saying something, since the design has barely changed since late 1993.<br><br>
