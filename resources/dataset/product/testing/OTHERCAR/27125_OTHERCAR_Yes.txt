            I went shopping around for vans for almost a month straight with my wife, and this van is by far the best we had seen.  We had looked at several vans both new and used.  We looked at and test drove several new vans to include the Chevy Venture, Ford Windstar, and Nissan.  The Safari was, to us, the best van for all around.  It is roomy, able to accommodate just about any task you may need, from hauling the kids to driving around town. The biggest downside to it's great size is that it has a great big gas tank to go along with it.  It is built on a truck chassis, but is surprisingly smooth driving.  Of all the vans we looked at we fell head over heels for the practicality of this vehicle.  It can fit me comfortably, I'm 6'5&quot;, and my wife.  Since I'm in the military I move around quite a bit, so, this van with a big chevy V-6 VORTEC engine allows me to move my family and be able to get a U-Haul trailer and bring along essentials to get started at my next duty station.  The biggest drawback I had with it, is that it has a boxy look, but, the interior more than makes up for that! Bottom line, if you buy a van BUY THIS ONE!   <br><br>
