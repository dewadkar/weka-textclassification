            Hello everyone!

I am 22 years old and I just bought my second car, a 1997 Mazda Proteg� SE.  I used to have a 1993 Ford Festiva before and believe me, nothing to compare!

I have to admit that I didn't want to sell my car.  Your first car is always something special in your life.  I've driven it everywhere, I took my friends on endless road-trips around the province of Quebec and it will always remain in my best memories.  I had my Festiva to go to school and with a "student" budget, it was the best I could afford.

It has been a good car overall the 3 years I owned it.  It had 90.000 miles when I let it go, but I had too many things to fix on it to make it work properly.  The muffler, the clutch, the wires, and so on.  Also, here in Canada, the winters are quite rough on the cars and they rust quickly.  Finally, I don't want to be fancy but this car was kinda outdated!

I decided to go shopping for something more reliable, more comfortable, and a bit more stylish.  I first looked at the Toyota Tercel.  Nice car, but so expensive!  I saw a 1994 Tercel at $9.000.  Eh, hello?!  Is it me or it's a bit too much?  As for the Civic, the insurance was too high for me.

I went to test-drive a Nissan Sentra and I decided that it was not for me.  Nissans are high-rated but I really have the feeling that that car was cheap.

I passed by a dealership-on-the-corner, and I saw that white Mazda Proteg�.  So cute!  I tried it and I loved it right away.  And the quality feeling you get when you drive it, it's hard to explain.  It has 50.000 miles on it and I have the feeling I could make another 100.000 without any major problems!

I have to commute 60 miles a day and I think this car handles it very well.  Especially in the traffic, the clutch and the manual transmission are easy to manage.  And the gas consumption!  I am used to my Festiva and I though that no car could do better than that.  NOT TRUE!  My Proteg� is better!  I was very glad to discover that especially with the gas price these days.

Another good aspect about driving a Proteg� are the seats.  I really like the molding of the seats, they support you very well when you turn quickly.  They give the feeling that you're driving a sport car.

The engine is peppy (I got the 1.5 liter, 92hp) and it's just enough.  I am often the first to go on a traffic light and I don't even make it on purpose!

What I was most surprised of is that my dad is jealous of my car!  He got a 1998 VW Jetta and he prefers my car.  I've always dream to have a VW but now, I think that Mazda is the dream come true!

Anyways, if you can afford a 2001, go ahead!  I saw them and they are amazing!  Especially the Proteg� 5.  But my 1997 really exceeds my expectations!

What are you waiting for?  Go buy one!
