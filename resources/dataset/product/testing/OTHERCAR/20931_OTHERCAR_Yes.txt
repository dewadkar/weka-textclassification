            First impressions of the Chrysler aren't that impressive. It looks like an old, almost classic car, albeit one that's slightly bigger. But after a while, you somehow come to love and cherish this veichle. 
I realise that this moment in time, there are currently another 120 opinions on this, so I'll try to be compact. If you're thinking of buying one of these, please read this!

<b>Price:</b> At under $20k, the PT is very well priced, and at a similiar price to inferior models.

<b>Looks:</b> As I said before, it looks strange at first, but after a while you'll come to appreciate it's style. It's a five-door, which is very handy if you have kids, and the car is reassuringly solid.

<b>Features:</b> You can pay a bit more for the metallic paint-job, but even if you don't, theres plenty of features here. Even the basic version comes complete with air-conditioning, electric windows, and a CD player- nice.

<b>Drive:</b> The Chrysler drives superbly. At it's heart is a 2.0 litre engine, similiar to that of the Neon, and can go up to 140bhp. It's top speed is 118mph, and it's 0-60 is 9.6 seconds, so it's still very quick for it's size.

But far and above the best thing about the PT is it's versitility. It's extremely spacious inside, again great for kids. But the back seat can fold in two, fold forwards, or can be taken out to turn it into a van.
It's an MPV that's good to drive - now that's rare.<br><br>
