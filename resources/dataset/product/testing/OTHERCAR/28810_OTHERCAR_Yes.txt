            Having just settled in for a nice nap after an exhausting round of golf with my &quot;always 10 strokes better than me&quot; brothers-in-law, I suddenly bolted upright with the thought, &quot;Oh my God! I left the camera on the bumper of the car!&quot;

I had left my Kodak 210 on the rear bumper of one of the family cars when I unpacked my golf bag. And when I got downstairs to look, the bumper I left it on....had left!

Holy ____! What was I going to do? Oh, not to worry, here comes the car and bumper now. Maybe! No, it's not there somehow miraculously stuck to the bumper anymore. Well maybe! No, my sister-in-law hadn't noticed it. Oh no! Where is it?

She remarked, &quot;Well, I thought I saw your camera lying on the road back there. But I thought, surely that wasn't....&quot;. I said, &quot;Holy ____!&quot;

We were back in the car faster than the Dukes of Hazard. And found it laying on the side of the road about three blocks down.

The batteries lay, squashed, in the middle of the road. And the case was a bit scratched up. I cradled my poor baby in my hands and we returned with the injured party. I could have sworn I felt it shivering. Its little 2x zoom was beating a mile a minute!

Thoughts of $100 dollar bills, floating up to heaven, raced through my mind. And when I initially put fresh batteries in it, the camera showed no signs of life. Bummer! This really put a damper on my weekend! 

When we returned home, I plugged it into the wall converter, and it came back to life! Its Alive!! And since then, it has worked with batteries just fine.

Thank God Kodak makes a rugged, dependable product. Rugged enough to put up with my stupidity! Even with the Kodak name, I did not expect this camera to ever work again.

But it is clicking right along. And it doesn't hardly wince anymore when I take it out of the case. I think it has either forgotten the incident, or it has forgiven me. And my Kodak 210 has accepted that I am only, after all, human.

That's my epinion! Mahalo for stopping by! <br><br>
