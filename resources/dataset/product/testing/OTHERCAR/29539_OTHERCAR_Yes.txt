                The kodak 240 digital camera is a well worth the money compared to other digital camera in its field. While is does seem to like batteries, the  kit comes with 4 regular cheapos, 4 nmh rechargables that do give it the power it absorbs, the recharger and the ac adaptor. The camera is user friendly and its menu and software is very self explanatory. Simple to use from the box to your hand.Even Homer Simpson couldn't screw this one up. I think this is one digital camera that wouldn't even kill Kenny from South Park. 
     Very pleased with its extreme ease of use and its quality picture results. Clarity and exposure correctness is excellent.
     If you are looking for a digital and don't want to give up your first born, this is the camera to choose.
