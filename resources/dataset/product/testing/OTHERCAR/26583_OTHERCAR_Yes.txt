            first of all, i am still in my "break in period" so i cant really torture it to see how it handles... accelerates..etc.

these are the vehicles i reject after test driving it, b4 i bought the 4runner:
dream car: nissan frontier crewCab SC
dream car replacement: nissan extera
second choice: toyota tacoma (4doors)
third choice: honda element
never considered 4runner because it was too expensive.

complaints: 
GAS MILAGE- is pretty bad for a vehicle(18/21) but i guess it is one of the better one for an SUV(MUCH better than frontier/tacoma/extera, equilvalent to element. i drive a camry b4 this... so it will take some time to get use to the gas cost.
FEELING THE ROAD- the engine is not as quiet as some people say, but it is pretty good. when driving i do feel the road's cracks and bumps(not use to yet). but it is way better than frontier/tacoma/extera. 
-lack of mirrors for the ladies to do there makecups on the road. they should have it, at least on the passenger side.
that is it so far.......

now the juicy stuff:
STORAGE CAPACITY- that tank is so roomy... it is perfect for camping/off-road/skii trip etc.back seat can be fold down to be as flat as the trunk(like a truck). 

COMFORT/CONVIENCE- seats and steering weel can be adjusted any way for a tall/short/fat people. there are much more cooler options but i didnt get it. front seat can be fold back evenly with the back seat like a bed (one of the Element's feature). automatic AC controler, i will never be too cold or hot again. 
-awesome stereo equipment with just the standard.
-cups and water bottles holder. 4 cup holders and 6 water bottle holders.
-trash bag holders.
-air conditioning vent for the back passengers.

LOOKS- my dream vehicle is actually the nissan frontier crew cab.( that truck is the Bomb for looks) after rejecting that truck, i didnt care too much for looks on anything else. so i really (dont know)/(dont care) how my 4runner looks. ever since i own the car i have notice that everybody who got a glimps of my car have to take a second look. in the parking lot or on the street.(it is like Belle in sleeping beauty).

PRICE- original the 4runner was too expensive for me. MSRP(27ish-36ish) plus options. but i manage to caught the "only one deal". my car's MSRP is $29,033 bought if for $23,788 plus tax. this is less expensive than frontier/top model honda accord/top model camry.
it is 1k more expensive than the top model of honda element/extera, but they suck so who cares.

too bad i didnt test drive more SUVs to give you a better comparasion. but i hope this helps.
