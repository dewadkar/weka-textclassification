            With this review of these two amazing automobiles, I have decided yet again to share my passion for exotic automobiles.  Ferrari and Lamborghini, two names that are almost unheard when the subject of exotic cars are brought up.  These two manufacturers of high speed vehicles can be identified as benchmarks of exotic automobiles.  In this review, I will examine what many consider the top of the line model for each of these car companies.  While the gap between the prices of these two cars is rather large, they can be put in similar categories because of the fact that they cost over $150,000 and they are high speed exotic automobiles.

<b>The Ferrari 360 Modena</b>
This car is now the companies flagship vehicle.  This mid-engine car is such a beautiful car, any person to lay there eyes on this spectacle is surely a lucky individual.   The car carries a 3.6 liter V-8 engine which cranks out 395 horses at 8500 RPMs.  Acceleration? 0 - 60 MPH takes just  4.3 seconds.  The Modena brings an optional F1 6-speed manual transmission which alone costs more than many cars available today.  This transmissions gives the driver overwhelming grace shifting through the gears with ease.  The 360 Modena has some of the best braking statistics in the world.  The car can go from 60 - 0 MPH in 110 feet and 80 - 0 MPH in 188 feet; simply world class braking.  Handling has always been a strong characteristic of Ferraris, and the Modena is no exception.  For those familiar with handling testing, the Modena does the slalom in 67.4 MPH (this from my knowledge is only outdone by the Porsche 911 Turbo).  The styling of this car is simply unmatchable.  Exotic, yet not overdone, the exterior is sheer beauty.  Smooth, aerodynamics matched with great looking 18 inch wheels, the Ferrari 360 Modena is an absolutely beautiful piece of machinery.

<b>The Lamborghini Diablo 6.0</b>
The Diablo 6.0 is truly an awe inspiring vehicle.  The car, made basically for pure speed, sports a V-12 engine with 550 horsepower.  This car zooms 0 - 60 MPH in 3.6 seconds which is barely slower than the McLaren F1 (the fastest street legal car as of now).  The Lamborghini Diablo 6.0 is faster than the 360 Modena as well as the Porsche 911 Turbo.  The car has a 5-speed manual transmission.  Braking 60 - 0 MPH, the Diablo 6.0 travels 120 feet.  This car does handle great as well, speeding through the slalom at 66.4 MPH.  The design of the Diablo 6.0 is, in my opinion, a look which you either love or you hate.  I, personally, do not really like the look of the Diablo 6.0.  It is rather overdone and a little too extreme for me.  This car is definitely impressive, but you are paying for it.

<b>Comparisons</b>
These two cars are both extremely expensive as well as rare sights on the roads these days.  I personally have seen a couple 360 Modenas and no Diablo 6.0's.  The Diablo 6.0 is definitely faster than the Modena by a decent gap.  The Modena, however, outmatches the Diablo 6.0 in braking and handling.  In the top speed category, the Diablo 6.0 takes the award with a top speed of 205 MPH as opposed to the Modena's 189 max.  A major factor when considering each of these cars is the price.  Well, the Modena is way cheaper at a base price of about $152,000.  The Diablo 6.0? A bank account draining $275,000 base price.  Quite a difference eh?

<b>Conclusions</b>
Both of these cars are highly rare automobiles with amazing statistics.  If you have the money and are considering one of these two vehicles, I would definitely recommend the 360 Modena.  One, you'll save over a hundred grand, and I think that the car looks better.  However, if you want to be one of the fastest moving people on the planet, go with the Diablo 6.0.  For the rest of us, we'll keep following these cars out of amazement when we see them on the roads; that is, if we can keep up.<br><br>
