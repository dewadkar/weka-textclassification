            As my four year old tends to say, "A long time ago, when I was a little boy..." In 1993 I bought a Jeep Cherokee Sport, brand new.  It was the first brand-new car I had ever purchased.  After years spent driving cars like a Ford Mustang or a Pontiac Firebird, I needed something that had a little more space to cart around the keyboards, guitars, PAs, amplifiers, and other band equipment from gig to gig.

I chose the Jeep Cherokee for one reason, and one reason only...it was BOXY.  Yup - just the fact that the car was almost SQUARE was the sole reason I bought it.  I did not test drive anything else, I wanted a SQUARE car, and I got it.  

But I got so much more...so much that when the car was 2 years old, I traded it in for a 1995 Jeep Cherokee Sport.
I had already put 72,000 miles on the '93 so I figured I would start all over with a new one. 

What did I get for my purchase?  Well, I got what at the time was considered a 'truck' that drove like a car.  Nice and smooth, with a powerful engine that could haul the load, and my friends as well.  I became the neighborhood mover-guy.  Need to move anything from point A to point B...give me a call.  Got a bunch of people who want to go to the concert, and not have to hassle with parking...give me a call.

Comfortable seats, everything within arms-reach on the dashboard, the air conditioning is ice-cold (still to this day), power everything...a good amount of cargo space in the back that virtually doubles when you fold down the rear seats.  The height of the car is perfect - just low enough to get in and out of easily, and just high enough to drive over most every piece of road debris you come across.  Need to turn around, but one of those annoying medians are in the way?  Just drive right over it!  (hahaha just kidding)   The rear door hatch lifts up and high-enough out of the way for most average-height people.  A nice feature are the speakers mounted in the hatch so when the hatch is open, the speakers are above your head, and works as an awesome rain shield when an unexpected shower kicks up while you're tailgating!

The down side?  There were a few 'little things' missing when I got the '95.  When you open the rear passenger doors, the interior lights do not come one.  Same thing for the hood.  When you lift the hood, there is no light.  Turns out those lights, as well as one in the ashtray, were 'extras' you had to specifically request and pay for - but who thinks of those things?  I guess Jeep did not want to pay for the extra door-jamb plungers used to trigger the lights.  

The main drawback of this is that if you have a security system triggered by the lights coming on inside the car (as most of the alarm systems do), if someone broke in to your car using the back doors, your alarms would never trigger!  And now that I have kids, I have to keep one of the front doors open to have the light on inside if I putting them in or taking them out of the car.

Another 'con' about this car is the way-undersized rear passenger doors.  They get cut down in size dramatically from the front doors because of the rear wheels.  The door is practically 2/3 over the wheel, so you almost have to be a contortionist to get in.   Good thing I drive it, because my 6'6 frame would never be able to get in and out of the rear seat of this car easily.   And Jeep has never solved this problem.  The rear doors are STILL designed the same way.  

In the 194,000 miles I have put on this car, it has only needed a few 'major' repairs.  In the 'expected repairs' category, I have replaced the water pump, distributor cap/rotor, thermostat, belt, hoses, spark plugs/wires.  In the 'unexpected repairs' category, I had to replace the radiator prematurely due to a rock that caused a hole, the oil pump (which turned out to be a clogged screen in the oil pan), and the electric fan that helps cool the radiator.

Not bad for a car with 194,000 miles on it, and still going strong!  I am going to be very sad when we get rid of it - the wife wants a mini-van to better cart around the kids, the dog, the stroller, the car seats, the cooler, the diaperbag, the toys, etc etc etc. . .So we'll either sell it outright, or trade it in...any takers?
