            I have a 1998 Dodge Neon and have had no problems with it. After reading some of the other opinions on here, I must be a lucky owner.

I purchased a brand-new 1998 Neon after my Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme died a slow and agonizing death (brought to a rapid end by a hit and run). I live in the city and park on the street, so a big factor when choosing a new car was parkability. I had to pass up several parking spots on many occasions because my Cutlass was just too big to fit in the spot. I was looking for something small and cheap. 

I narrowed my choices to either a Neon or a Ford Escort. I test drove the Escort first and it was okay, but I wasn�t thrilled. Then to put the nail in the coffin, the salesman wouldn�t speak to me when talking about the car, he would only speak to my boyfriend. Even though we had made it clear that I was buying the car, not him. So, off to the Dodge dealership we go.

Although the salesman was a complete doofus, I liked the way the Neon handled in city traffic. Nice and zippy. It was also cheaper than the Escort, so I could get all the bells and whistles I wanted. They were also running a special 1.9% financing rate. This is a special they run quite a bit, so if you�re looking for a Dodge, look for the special.

PROBLEMS
I have followed the maintenance plan and thus far, have only encountered minor problems: the liner on the sunroof �door� is coming loose on the edges, and the windows are not completely tight to the roof. As a result when I wash my car, a little water ends up running down the inside of the front door windows. This only happens when I wash it, rain doesn�t get in.

PERFORMANCE
This is a great car for city driving. It zips in and out of traffic and finding a parking spot is a much easier. My gas mileage in the city is about 22-24 mpg. 

On the highway, the car can move, but it takes longer to accelerate than other cars and once you hit about 75 mph, it gets shaky. My highway gas mileage is about 27-30 mpg. I do take 4-5, 600 mile+ trips per year and it�s okay, but if you are planning to do a lot of highway driving, I would recommend another car.

Also, if you have a full car (4 adults), the pick-up is very slow. Not quite as zippy.

COMFORT
For me, I am very comfortable in my car. I�m 5�3� and I can easily reach the pedals and all the buttons and knobs. I do wish the cupholders were placed better. They�re right under the ashtray, so that if you have a medium drink from McDonald�s, you can�t open the ashtray. I don�t smoke, but I keep change for the tolls in there. This placement has been fixed for the newer models, though.

My boyfriend is not comfortable in my car. He�s 6�0� and broad shouldered. His head is really close to the roof and he says he feels like he�s getting squished by the door. The unit for the controls for the electric windows poke out of the drivers door and it knocks his knee. So, if you�re a tall/big person, this car may not fit you well.

OPTIONS
I did get all the bells and whistles (except for the CD player): electric locks &amp; windows, sunroof/moonroof, spoiler, remote entry, alarm, ABS brakes, bigger engine. And for Christmas 2 years ago, I got a remote starter. One option I wish they offered is remote trunk opener. Maybe they do now. I haven�t had any problems with any of these.

SUMMARY
I really love my Neon. It�s zippy in city traffic, has good gas mileage and is easy to park! If you are looking for a city car and don�t want to spend a lot of money, I do recommend this car.
