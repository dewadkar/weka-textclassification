            Remember riding go carts as a kid?  The noise...the wind...the quick steering response...how after three laps you got to thinking &quot;Man, I wish this thing would go faster!&quot;  The same experience is now available to adults in the Toyota Paseo.

My Paseo replaced an aging Toyota Cressida, which was three times as heavy and very opulent.  I loved the car from the moment I laid eyes on it...enough that I didn't realize that 1.5 liter engine would be much more at home mounted on a lawnmower than pulling a car in traffic.  I think the reason I didn't perceive it's lack of power was that the illusion of speed is great in this car.  You sit low.  Road noises, wind noises, traffic noises assault you.  It feels like a go cart.

The go cart motif continues to the handling.  The short unibody construction makes for a short chasis, but begs for more tire...with quick manuvers on dry pavement, it was easy to get the rear end to slide.  As cool as this looks on Dukes of Hazzard Reruns, it's a bit unsettling on a twisty two lane.

The interior is laid out very well - everything is within an arms length.  Heck, the car's so small that the rear WINDOW is within an arms length for the driver.  It has a rear seat, but it's unusable for anyone but small children.  I'm 5 and a half feet tall, and my four year old (at the time) complained about being cramped.  This is at best a two-adult car, and you'll notice the added weight of the second adult.

Build quality was very good - fit and finish of body panels was excellent for a lower priced car.  

If I were in the small sporty car market again, I'd look harder at the Honda CRX (if you need a back seat, the Paseo isn't for you anyway, and the CRX is much more sporting to drive).<br><br>
