            I bought this car for my wife. She needed a decent size sedan with 4 doors and an automatic. We considered a Jetta, but for the price, the car is way to small on the inside. VW Passat is the ultimate, but $22,000 will get you a bare bone car without luxuries. 
Recently, our friends bought a 1999 Altima and were very happy about the car. I decided to go to the dealer myself and fell in love with the 2000 GLE model. Equipped with 16 inch wheels, sun roof, leather interior, automatic, fog-lights and a nicely tuned suspension and auto-everything, the Altima added up to $22,000. I got it for $21,000. Although not German Engineering, the $4,000 I saved on an equally equiped Passat makes me feel content with Altima.
The car feels solid, responsive and reasonably quick for a 2.4L four-banger. The transmission shifts are smooth and barely noticeable. The stereo, complete with CD/Tape/AM/FM, is great. The spacious interior feels like you're riding in a more expensive car (thanks to the leather covered seats and door panels.)
The only negative that I can think of is that the wind noise is somewhat obvious at highway speeds. Other than that, the car is terrific.<br><br>
