            I'm a sears salesman and sell a few models of the sony mavica. I've used it and sold many of them to many different customers, never have I gotten a complaint about the quality of this unit, and to tell you the truth the defective return rate is low for the mavicas in general. I guess sony really puts quality work in there mavicas, sony phones on the other hand would be a different opinion. 

After learning about the sony mavica 83, I have found that the picture resoultion is excellent with a excess of over 1024x764 and the 1 min video is fun to play with, although the quality of the avi/mpeg isn't that great, no digital cameras gives out excellent end result movies in this class and type of cameras, digital camcorders would be another story. 

Just playing around with it and demoing it for myself I took pictures of my class ring. Using the &quot;MACRO&quot; mode which allows you to take pictures of really small objects, it auto focused itself on my ring and took a picture. I popped the disk out and viewed the picture on a nearby PC, and was amazed by the sharp, crisp, clear, and detailed picture that displayed infront of me. I don't really need glasses but to tell you the truth I could actully see the small creaves's that my eyes could not see. Since I was so impressed of the picture, I suggest this model mavica to anyone of my customers interested in taking pictures of jewalry or other small objects for e-bay or such. The excellent macro resolution will impress anyone. After taking pictures around the store, I found that the picture result was also very clear and sharp, but with the optical/digtal precise zoom lens, is not very strong, but is precise, but again you really don't get that much of a zoom lens with any digital camera of this class. 

If your interested in more of a zoom lens but not so much on the resolution you may want to go with a mavica FD73 which gives you a better optical zoom lens but at a lower resolution of 640X480. Then next models up will give you a better zoom lens, you'll find. Now as far as me getting one of these suckers for myself I would love one, but my god look at the price tag on these things. I understand they have better zoom lens then most digital cameras and that its the 1st digital camera to record right on a floppy disk. So you have to ask yourself a question, do you want to pay more for the sony name, the better zoom lens, and the 3.5inch floppy disk access? In my opinion, I would suggest this camera to e-bay users, the deperately digital camera illiterate, and to the rich. For the rest of us like myself I would be fine with a normal digital smartmedia camera, which will cost the equalivant to a 83, this just as good of a resolution..less on the zoom..and just a normal memory card for around $300. Since the mavica uses the easy to use floppy, and the zoom lens you have to shell out around $600 for it. But this is how the mavicas have always been..overpriced. The mavica FD73 when it came out was only 640x480 resolution and zoom for $500. Get real you could get a regualr digital camera with a compact flash card with 640x480 $250! I say, if you wanna spend the money for the sony then go for it! but if your uneasy about it and don't need all of the features that come with the mavica, get a regualr camera. don't worry about messin with the wires either to download your images on the computer, they have readers out for the compact flash cards and the smartmedia cards..all USB driven..also avaliable at SEARS!<br><br>
