            This is my 2nd ML320E 2000. The first one saved my life in a head on head collision with a minivan that lost control on a icy road. One always hopes you don't have to rely on all those raved about safety features. If I had to do it again I wouldn't choose any other vehicle. 
There is a lot of hype and negative publicity about The Ml series.
I think it is now generally accepted that the initial models 1998 +early 1999 had some severe quality issues, new factory etc. Fortunately MB sorted out the problems and the late  '99 and 2000 models are superb
I live in Northern Canada and spend 6 months of the year driving on ice and snow. As I am involved in motor sport I really put this vehicle through its paces. On ice snow and gravel the ESP is uncanny. You can throw it into a corner which would have any other vehicle spinning like a top and it will magically be put back on the road. Piece of mind for when my wife has to drive in these conditions. It is extremely difficult to lose control of this vehicle. There are many journalists who write an opinion about the ML320/430 after driving it around the block in Los Angeles. The vehicle only comes to its right in the worst driving conditions, torrential rain, ice, snow, blizzards etc.
The four wheel drive system is a novel idea and takes some getting use to. A lot of people shoot it down without realizing its full potential. My second vehicle is a jeep TJ with 4 inch lift lockers front and rear and 35 inch tires obviously no comparison off-road.
The only factors limiting the Ml's off-road capability is it's lack of ground clearance and approach and depart angles and tires.
Initially I was disappointed, as I got stuck in mudholes my jeep could drive through in 2 wheel drive.
What they don't tell you in the manual is that for great off-road performance you should put it in low range with ESP OFF!!
The difference is amazing all of a sudden I can go and fetch my jeep where it got stuck in the lake through thick slimy mud and sand...remember the 50cm depth limit though.
All in all an unbelievably well thought out and built vehicle. I wouldn't have expected anything less from MB.
