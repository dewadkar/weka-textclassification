            This car is ALMOST an amazing value.  It's a beautiful car with a wonderfully powerful engine (I have the V6 and can't imagine why anybody would even consider the V8 because the V6 has unbelievable power.) 

The car handles extremely well for a big luxury car.  The wheel actually gives you some feedback, they dialed back that squishy Detroit steering enough so the car is fun to drive as well as being comfortable.  The suspension is a long way from the old-style Detroit float as well.  The suspension is nicely tuned to make the car quite tossable in the corners, and the tires are well-mated to the suspension.  This is a car that urges you to go faster in the twisty back roads rather than one that screams "slow down, damn it, I'm just a domestic land yacht."  GM has finally figured out how to give a big U.S. car European road manners. 

It's so smooth and so powerful you really have to watch the speedometer.  I've looked down to see myself going 105 mph on the highway and didn't even realize it.  If it were legal, I think this thing could cruise comfortably at over 100mph all day long. 

The automatic transmission is a pretty good match for the engine.  At high speed, it just purrs along quietly and efficiently, even when climbing steep hills.  There is so much torque and power at the high end, that the transmission never sweats or hunts for the right gear.  If you want to accelerate suddenly at speed, it pops down into the right gear immediately and off you go.  At lower speeds, there is a small lag before everything roars to life after you step on the gas.  But once you put your foot all the way down, you won't leave it there for long.  After that tiny pause, it kicks you back into the seat with authority and gains speed like a sports car.  The whole process is very refined and dignified, never losing composure, but it's also a ton of fun.  The acceleration reminds me of a friend's Jaguar.  

When you want to bring all this fun to a close, the brakes are solid and strong.   There is no stability problem and the standard ABS works well in bad weather.  

The good stuff doesn't stop there, because the mileage delivered is outstanding for a big car.  I regularly get more than 25 mpg on the highway, and that's going pretty quick, and on very hilly terrain.  Unlike the V8 version, the V6 drinks regular gas, which improves overall economy even more.  It's also got a big tank, giving a very nice cruising range.

Inside, the seats are incredibly comfortable, the dash and the whole interior is beautiful, it's very roomy inside, the trunk is big, and it comes with almost every luxury feature imaginable (heated seats, great stereo, passenger climate control, rain sensing wipers that really work, incredible headlights etc.)  Although I thought this was rather silly at the time I bought the car, the controls for the temperature, fan, and stereo on the steering wheel are actually very nice.  There is a fairly full-featured trip computer, which lives in a little deeply recessed pod at the top of the dash.  It's just one single line of text, limiting the amount of information that can be displayed at one time.  Although clearly not the latest technology, I kind of like the implementation, because it keeps the center of the dash very uncluttered.  It's a clean look.  The computer can also read out oil pressure for you, so you can effectively get a full-gage cluster when you want it.  This is not as good as a dedicated oil pressure gage, but at least it's better than an idiot light.

The shift gate for the automatic is Mercedes style, with no button to depress, you just move it up and down, and either left or right at the same time to shift through the offset gates.  It's a nice solid, leather wrapped gearshift that clicks through the gears cleanly and crisply.  I can't imagine a nicer implementation of an automatic shifter, it's a joy to use. 

About the only thing I don't like about the interior are the power lock buttons.  They are small and mounted high up on the door near the door handles.  It's not an intuitive place for them, and because they are the same color as the door, they blend into the door and are somewhat hard to see (in daylight, they are lit at night).  And no, I'm not a blind old guy.  

It's also a very quiet, refined ride.   I use this car principally for a 200 mile run up into the mountains to my vacation house, and it's a marvelous ride.  The difference between driving up there in this, vs. my S.U.V. is like night and day.  I find myself far less tired and fatigued after 3 hours in this car.  The performance improvements in handling etc. are not at the expense of highway comfort.  It's just as comfortable as those old Detroit boats for long highway drives.  When the weather is bad up in the mountains and we need the truck, we always take it reluctantly.  

I got a very good deal on my Aurora and really thought I had scored the equivalent of a BMW 5 series, Audi A6 or top-end Lexus for basically half the price.

I have now owned the car for two years, and I no longer have any illusions that I own a Lexus.  This thing is far from Toyota bulletproof.  In fact, build quality is relatively poor, particularly in the interior.  It's never stranded me, but some little thing needs to be fixed almost every time it goes in for an oil change.  Since I've owned it, I've had the following problems: rear defroster doesn't work, the headlights flicker on and off (needed a brand new alternator after 8k miles), the steering wheel squeaks, the steering has funny feedback issues (something messed up in front suspension), the trim on the edge of the window wasn't installed properly so part of it sticks out.  Its now got little rattles somewhere in the dash that do not bode well for its longevity.  You just get a sense after driving it for a while, that it's not going to last forever.

The car came with a five year bumper-to-bumper warranty, and I plan to keep it exactly five years and one day.  If this much has gone wrong with it in just the first 25K miles, what will the future hold?  Don't ask me, because this is going to be somebody else's problem after the warranty is gone.  If you are smart, it won't be you. 

The reliability and build quality issues are really a shame, since I still really like this car.  My wife and I still fight over who gets to drive it.  I don't think there is anything remotely close to this car in terms of features, comfort, etc. at this price.  If GM could just implement this essentially excellent design better, it would be an absolute winner.  They are so agonizingly close, but they just can't quite close the deal.

After putting out a car like this, GM is planning to kill off the brand entirely.  2003 is the last model year for the Aurora apparently.  That's like climbing 90% of the way up Mount Everest and jumping off on purpose because you'll never make the summit.  It's really a shame.  With just a little more work, the Aurora could have had a great future.
