            BMW 5 series is the first step to getting to the top. A 3 series says that you have a nice car , a 5 series says that your upper class. especially a 540 . Because a 540 has a 8 cylinder engine and has teh 5-7 series rims that if you put armor all shine on it, it will blind your eyes when sparkling in the sun.  I take very special care of my BMW, i wash it weekly, park it in the shade, clean the interior every time i get the chance, and i park it where there could be less accidents.  BMW 5 series has 2 &quot;main&quot; vehicles : the 528  and the 540.  The 528 I wouldnt reccomend because it has a 6 cylinder engine and is not as luxurious as the 540.         BMW 5 series specialize in the field of comfort and smooth handling and smooth ride.  You can go 50 miles an hour down a bumpy road and fell little tremblence. These series car's are made for the owner to just favor and spoil like it was a kid because you can fully load your car with the speaker system , or drop it a couple inches to make it look sporty.<br><br><br>
