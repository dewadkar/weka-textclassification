            Why:
I like the looks of the Jetta. I've always trusted German Engineering. It was affordable 17,400 for the GT and test drove it.

Love:
I love the reliability. It's now 70,000 miles and the only thing I've had to replace was the brakes. Of course I take good care of it, changing oil every 4-5K miles. 

Hate: 
Don't get black. It gets dirty really fast. Dings and scratches are very apparent.

To Drive:
It's a pleasure. For a 4 cylinder car it's zippy. Shhh, I've taken it over 100 and it was fine. Though anything more would have been dangerous. It can't quite handle the high speeds. The handling is awesome. Not as good as the GTI (hatchbacks), but I like it.

Who should buy:
I'd recommend it to first time buyers. It's a good introductory car for a fresh-out-of-college, young professional. I'd also recommend it to the budget-conscious family man. It's got a roomy passenger seat and the back is also comfy. For people into performance, I know of a couple of guys who have bought all kinds of upgrades with their Jetta and has significantly increased horsepower. Chip, exhaust, and cool body work. A cool site to check out is CarREVIEW.com. I found some good help from the community there. <br><br>
