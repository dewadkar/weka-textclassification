            I've owned several cars, both foreign and domestic. My 1996 Camry LE was bought used in 1997 when it was used 11 months old. I have driven the car a lot: it is now just over 110,000 miles. 

I'm not one to be meticulous about maintenance, but I have changed the oil between every 5,000 or 10,000 miles, and I have gotten the 30/60/90k service within 5,000 miles of those milestones. I have not had any mechanical difficulties with the car. It is roomy, comfortable, reliable and fits my needs perfectly. 

Because it is my personal car, I don't get a chance to ride in the backseat very often. But every chance I get, I like the backseat. If the passenger moves up the seat just a little, there is plenty of room in back, and the armrest makes the backseat super comfy.

I wish there was a similar armrest for the front seat, but I guess I should be keeping my hands on the steering wheel anyways.

I plan to keep this car for a long time.<br><br>
