            I've always held the opinion that motor vehicles are primarily functional and that one need not have a &quot;luxury&quot; car in order to satisfy his need for reliable and comfortable transportation.  However, having now experienced my third Sedan DeVille (beginning with a 1989 model), I can truthfully assert that the comfort, feel and performance of these automobiles fully justify the premium one must pay for their enjoyment.  We are now driving a 1994 Concours model Sedan DeVille with about 52K miles on it.  While we've never really had a major warranty claim on this vehicle, we did get a seven year - seventy thousand mile warranty at the time of its acquisition, when it was two years old.  Although we did need a brake job, the car still is functioning on its original rubber and it appears to have another ten thousand miles on it.  A recent oil change and lube at our local Cadillac dealer was less than $22.00, more reasonable than the &quot;quick change&quot; spots around town.  

          Best of all is the comfortable ride, cushioned on deluxe leather upholstery with exquisite trim and complete instrumentation.  All of the auxiliary systems on the car are working well and have done so for the five years we've driven it.  

         In summary, the point we wish to make is that sometimes it is worth it to go the extra several hundred (or maybe even a thousand) dollars.
