            I've been wanting a digital camera for a while.  I've used a couple different kinds through my job, and enjoy the convenience and the ability to edit pictures on my computer.  So here is a camera, on sale and I'm in the mood!  It is a well known brand name, so that's a plus.  It is well within my meager budget, and so I go for it!  

The instructions are well written, and I'm able to begin taking pictures on the way home while my wife drives.  By the time the school bus arrives with my son, I've even photographed some graffiti on the telephone pole about a friend and it is legible in the image.  My son is taking pictures after only a brief verbal instruction.  Love the camera.  

But at home, it stops working.  Why?  The batteries are dead.  Yes, there was something in the instructions about saving batteries by not using the flash and the LCD display, but I didn't realize just how short battery life could be.  The next day, I was more careful, but each time the camera is turned on it defaults to using the flash.  Need 4 more AA batteries the next day.

Well, I've bought a battery recharger and have ordered some rechargable batteries (sometimes you can't get what you want, when you want it living in the country)  I'm also learning to be better about conserving the batteries.

I do like the software that came with the camera.  PhotMax 2.4 is easy to use.  The images go into an album and you can handle them nicely from there.  The adjustments are easily made to the images.

Oh,  by the way, there is also shutter speed and f-stop setting adjustment on this camera.  I haven't quite figured that out yet, but I did learn that even the brightest full moon doesn't illuminate my shadow on the woodpile enough for a picture in the standard mode, no flash.

If you get this camera, you'll enjoy it.  It is a one handed model that's easy to use.<br><br>
