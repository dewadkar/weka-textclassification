            My parents bought me my first vehicle. A '95 raspberry S10. I wasn't expecting them to buy me a truck. I wanted a car. As I drove it more and more I came to like it. The color was something unexpected. Anyone can recognize me on the road. That's a PLUS.

I like the extra room in the extended cab. It's great for taking stuff like gym bags and shopping bags, but extra people don't fit well. Long rides are only good for 2 people. 

The seats are black and grey. I like the aphoulstery because it doesn't show stains and it holds up wonderfully. Cup Holders, most people don't really care about that, but they're nice because the insides lift out, if you spill something you can easily clean it up. Little things like that are what makes my S10 great.

I only have a few complaints about my truck. The steering is quite hard. It isn't easy like some of the newer trucks chevy makes. Also, it gets pretty bad gas mileage. I use my truck mostly in town, I don't take many long trips so I am not expecting too good of mileage especially out of a truck. I get about 16.2 miles per gallon at worst....19 at best. 

I have grown to love my pink truck and It gets good compliments all the time. If you won't be hauling many people around a small truck is nice, easy to manuver and you sit up higher than in a car. I'd recommend it for single people or anyone without kids.

Overall, a great vehicle for a college student.<br><br>
