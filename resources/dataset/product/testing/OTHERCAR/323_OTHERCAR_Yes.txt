 My family decided that we needed a larger vehicle, and were debating the SUV's vs Minivans.  I was driving a toyota corolla with 2 kids.  So one day I started my search, and ended up at Nissan, I got one look at the X-terra and fell in love.  I went home and started my search in aspect of price and options.  The following day I contacted a local dealer and went to test drive and possible purchase. I found the *one* I wanted, Hunter green, manual, 4WD, all options with the exception of the sunroof.  I was fortunate that I was able to haggle my price down a bit and we went home with the X-terra.  
 I have loved driving this vehicle, So far I have found nothing wrong with it.  I like the basic look it has, no funky buttons the controls are cut and dry as far as working them. The seating is high, and I really like the stadium seating in the back, it makes me keeping a eye on the children easier.  I do have some trouble getting them into their carseats due to the height.  It comfortably seats 5, with plenty of leg room in the back. The rear seats come out to make for more cargo room, although in my opinion it already has plenty of room. Mine also came with a first aid kit ,hopefully I will not have to put that to use. 
 I find that it handles fairly well, but does drive like a truck. While making u-turns it has a small radius which makes it easier.  I have never had a problem shifting, and the 4WD works great.  All in all I find this to be a very practical SUV that meets all of my families needs with a sporty look. <br><br>
