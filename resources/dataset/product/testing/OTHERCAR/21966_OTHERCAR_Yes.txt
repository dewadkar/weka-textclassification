            The Buick is a sporty, fun reliable car.  The problems with the car are minimal.  One of my major problems with mine is that the ugly steel hubcaps fall off constantly, which makes the wheels  even uglier.  Another problem is the noise inside the cabin, there are many clicks and rattles when the car is on, which get very annoying.  The car gets ok gas mileage, but is very reliable.  The car is very comfortable, especially on those long rides.  The radio is good, except the tape deck has broken twice.  The pros outweigh the cons, and this car is very worth the effort.  I would recommend this car, and was surprised that the quality on this car is as high as it is proving to be.
