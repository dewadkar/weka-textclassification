            I researched numerous digital cameras and finally made a decision to purchase the Hewlett Packard C200. What a pleasant surprise. I found this camera to be very well made and it was also well balanced. The instruction manual was very clear and well written. In less than fifteen minutes I was using this camera and all of it's many features. 

The photo quality was at least twice as good as I ever expected from this rice range from a digital camera. I found it very easy to download into my computer. The software included with the camera is very simple to operate and to the point. This is probably the BEST buy and BEST camera for the money. You can't go wrong owning this camera.<br><br>
