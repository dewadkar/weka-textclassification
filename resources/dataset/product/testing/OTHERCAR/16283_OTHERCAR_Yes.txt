                About a month ago, I decided to trade in my gas-guzzling Grand Marquis for the remarkably stylish and fuel-conserving Aerio. I truly wanted the GS wagon version, but the dealer was completely sold out of the 02' wagon models. So, I decided to purchase a "racy red" GS sedan and I have been very pleased ever since. The Aerio is stylish and I have received quite a few compliments by on-lookers. It handles very well on the highway and exhibits peppy acceleration with its 141 HP engine including a 4 speed automatic overdrive transmission. It is amazingly roomy on the inside for a small car--I am a heavy-set guy that requires more than adequate interior room. Value-wise, it offers a multitude of creature-comfort features including power windows and door locks. The six speaker Clarion sound system is crisp and clear with a no-hassle "standard" CD player (I have owned a Lincoln that did not have a CD player as standard equipment). The standard fog lamps give the car a racy feel, and the optional sunroof sets it apart from most subcompacts in its class. I chose this car over a Honda or Toyota because of its unique styling and well-known reliability--GM has been selling Suzuki's for over 15 years under the Geo moniker. Besides, I am spending less than half of what I spent before on gas--A real plus considering increasing gas prices and the on-going problems in the Middle East. The only negative is that Suzuki has a small dealer network where I live, and I would have liked a "free" extended warranty like most car manufacturers offer. However, I'm still very pleased with my purchase and that is what really counts!!
