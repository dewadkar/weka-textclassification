            Okay, we live on a dirt road - and the flat, square "butt" of this wagon allows all the kicked-up dirt to attach to the back end.  Good thing this 1994 Toyota Camry Wagon has a rear window washer and wiper - it needs it out here!

Our family purchased this car new when our most recent Oldsmobile developed terminal electrical problems.  Having owned a few Toyota pick-ups and been impressed with their reliability and quality of manufacture, we went to the Toyota dealership looking for something that could comfortably transport our family elders, was dependable to have them drive, and not sacrifice much cargo room.  They chose the Camry Wagon.  I admit, it wasn't my first choice (I would have gone with the 4-runner, but they have trouble climbing in and out).  

The Camry Wagon demonstrates economy of design and line.  Space is used efficiently, and the placement of the accessories is close. I sometimes confused the lever for the REAR wipers and the knob for the FRONT wipers (I think that's because I drive several different vehicles), or is that the knob for the rear wipers and the lever for the front ones?  But they're all right there at your fingertips.  Visibility is quite good.  The motor runs so quiet you have to read the dash to see if it's running or not.  Toyota added more insulation in their doors, too, so you don't get that tinny CLINK when you close the doors.  

For the life of me, I don't know why Toyota doesn't put more padding in their seats.  The seats of every Toyota I've been in (1994 and older) has been flat, firm, and not well padded.  They compress even worse - my two 80's models have permanent fanny dents, which isn't easy in a nearly non-padded seat.  So we use a nice cushion and get on with the important features.  

The rear opens with a hatch type door, and the rear seats fold down for more cargo space/length.  The hatch also has a "child safety" button that you can press which does not allow the hatch to be unlocked from the inside.  This feature, in light of recent child lock-ins, could be a good thing to use judiciously, and can just as easily be turned off. 

The low profile tires?  I hate them.  They always look flat, if their a little low they run on the sidewalls, and I don't care what they say, I don't think they provide all that much improvement in the ride.  I'd eliminate them. 

All in all, this conservatively styled Toyota has lived up to the reputation Toyota set long ago.  A good, reliable, utilitarian vehicle that provides many, many miles of dependable performance.
