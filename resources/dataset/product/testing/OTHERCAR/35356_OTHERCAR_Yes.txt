                 I've driven a Volvo 850 automatic transmission since 1995. When I was looking for a new car I considered the 850, the Ford Taurus, and the Saturn sedan. As I drove a volvo for many years before, I was all too aware of its fuddy-duddy notion. I found though that the newly designed interior and smoother exterior styling made it quite a slick car. Back in the day my friends wouldn't believe Volvo could make something stylish, until they went for a ride. After five years and 60,000 miles, the 850 is still getting along fine. The engine is still fresh, and the brakes have not had nearly as many problems as my old 240 wagon. 
     There are many luxury options on this baby that turn it from a family car to a sports car. While I opted out of the turbo option, I've heard it is a great feature for any autophiles. Leather trim is a must, and the moonroof is also a good feature. The car was also one of the first to have side-impact airbags, so for any teenage parents out there, this is a good car for a nervous 16/17 year old. While the car is powerful and quick, it also has a lot of interior space, so that five people can sit comfortably. I heartily recommend it.
