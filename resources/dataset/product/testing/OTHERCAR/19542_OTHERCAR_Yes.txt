            During the past half-century, Chevrolet has produced some memorable models.  

Corvette.  Camaro.  Monte Carlo.  Impala.  Malibu/Chevelle.  Chevette.  (OK, I threw that last one in because I knew someone eventually would.)

I have not owned many vehicles, period, but fortunately for me my father has.  And we each invite the other to drive our vehicles whenever we want or need to.  

Growing up, Chevrolet was always the brand of choice in our household.  My father was a teenager in the late 1950s, when he personally believes American carmakers produced some of the most distinctive cars ever made, such as the early Corvettes, some Cadillac models and the 1956 and 1957 Chevy Bel-Air.  My father owned a couple of the aforementioned Bel Air models when they were relatively new, and I've asked him why he didn't hang on to them. At the time, he explains, even the 1957 model wasn't viewed as a potential collector's car.  <i>No one</i> had a clue what tremendous value the car would later have.


<i>I mention all of this because I personally think the Monte Carlo (particularly the SS model of 1983-88) will eventually have some level of collector car status.</i>  


Many true Chevy enthusiasts love the Monte SS, and it's getting more and more difficult to find one in good shape or not.  If you can find an SS model in good shape, though, you can pick it up for approximately $6,000-up.  Be prepared to pay far more moola for a mint SS.

 
<b>My Monte Memories</b> 
My father had a 1979 Monte Carlo small-block V-8 that ran great for 19 years and 140,000 miles (he sold it to a co-worker who drives it daily).  

In early 1988, my father bought a new 1988 Monte Carlo SS.  He had always loved Montes, and the SS model was especially appealing.  The "regular" Monte had a refined appeal and was a mid-size car quite suitable for family use.  The SS had the same platform, but it was made to move with a 5.0L V-8.  

This car served as a NASCAR staple until the latter 1980s, running with Ford's Thunderbird.  Dale Earnhardt's Wrangler and early Goodwrench car of the mid- to late-1980s were SS models.  In fact, Dale's untimely death may bring some added attention to this car since it was the type he drove for several years.  

For whatever reason, Chevrolet ceased production of this rear-wheel drive musclecar in December 1987.  


<b>"It'll Move!"</b>
The salesman's departing words to my father were quite simple and still sum up this car quite well:

<i>"It'll move!"</i>  

This car simply sounds of power.  When you crank it up in a garage, you hear it.  I think it's best described as a rumble, and you certainly know you aren't in a four or six cylinder wimpy car. The RPMs shoot upwards immediately, and in fact, I always tap the accelerator to get the engine to wind down a little before putting the transmission in gear.  You also hear a slight "squeak" of the tires as you proceed to move.


<b>Performance</b>
The car registers over 100 mph, and I have no doubt it will do that easily (aftermarket equipment such as chips make it an even more powerful beast).  However, even at swift speeds, it's a smooth, solid and nimble ride for a solid, mid-size car.  It takes curvy roads with ease. 

However, this is not a foul-weather vehicle.  Slippery roads require some level of caution.  It's rear-wheel drive, and it's rather powerful.  That's fine on dry roads, but not on slick ones. 

No fuel injection with this car - it was a throwback to the real muscle car set up: Rear-wheel drive with a carb fuel intake.

This car gets around 19 to 20 miles per gallon in city driving.  Insurance costs are reasonable unless you choose to have it covered for higher collector car value.  Then, you will pay a higher premium but will be covered for a higher amount in the event of a loss.  
    

<b>The Interior</b>
This is a mid-size muscle car that can haul people as well as haul - well you know.  Five people can ride in the car.  Actually, a bench seat model can haul six, albeit those riding in the center might not be too comfy.  Seats are reasonably comfortable and trunk space is sufficient, but hey, this is a muscle car.  There is sufficient space for groceries and small boxed items. 

Much of the interior hearkens back to the '79 model my father owned.  Sliding controls adjust the heating.  Overall, the dashboard is rather straight.  However, the gages are easy to read (no digital readouts except on the radio).


<b>A Sporty Look that Didn't Change Much</b>
There are very minor differences in the taillights and the striping packages on the 1983-88 SS models.  Colors were limited for these models (I believe the most colors ever produced in one year was four - silver, white, burgundy and black). Earlier models came in only two colors - white and a gunmetal blue metallic. 


<b>1988 Marked the End of an Era</b>
Shortly after Dad bought his Monte, Chevrolet sent him the usual owner-satisfaction survey.  Dad was not shy about expressing his feelings over Chevy's dumping this model.  He wrote something to the effect that there were still some who wanted this type of car.  

Chevrolet resurrected the Monte name in the mid-90s.  Although I think the new Montes are certainly nice cars, I still view the older Montes as the best.

Apparently so do some other people.  My father's 1988 car gets lots of looks (and offers to buy the car).  

In fact, my mom reported that a guy in a new Chevy truck actually saluted them recently as they were driving along the highway in this white beauty of a muscle car.  My mother is not a car nut like we are, and she seemed a little befuddled by that gesture.

My Dad and I know what he meant.
