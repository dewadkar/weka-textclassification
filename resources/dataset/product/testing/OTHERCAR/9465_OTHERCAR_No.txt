            The Dodge Ram is the best looking truck on the road.  That is its most important virtue � girls at school tell me that it the sexiest of all pickups.  Unfortunately, the mechanic sees more of my Dodge�s sexiness than does the road.

I love my truck . . . when it runs.  It handles well.  I put Monroe Sensa-trac shocks on it, and it now handles as well as any fullsize pickup can be expected to, even on tall 265/75/16 tires.  The Infinity speaker system it has is awesome.  It is roomy for an extended cab pickup.  The 5.2L V-8 provides respectable power.  Though the steering is heavy, my truck is fun to drive.  I have, on occasion, turned down the opportunity to drive my mother�s 1993 BMW because I enjoy my truck.

The suspension on the Rams is commendable.  I take me 2x4 over some serious bumps off-road, and, though I am by no means feather-footed, the suspension has held up.

I now know that Dodge transmissions have a reputation for fragility.  The transmission on my 1996 Ram died � it had to be rebuilt � at 60,000 miles, and I was lucky.  Some owners don�t make it that far.  My yardman has several friends who drive Dodges � they have had similar problems with Dodge�s automatic transmission.  I have a friend who works in a repair shop, and, according to him, the shop rebuilds at least one Dodge truck transmission every week.  Ladies and Gentlemen, the jury is back, the verdict is in:  Dodge transmissions are . . . terrible!

The Dodge�s mechanical problems are not limited to the transmission.  My engine coil fell down into the engine compartment � the truck died.  The catalytic converter recently clogged up � the truck died.  Dodge�s parent company, Chrysler, took over a month to send in the new converter, which was promptly installed.  My truck now makes a high-pitched whine.  The engine knocks.  As Chrysler�s former CEO stated, �Too much quality can ruin you.�

The truck has significant electrical problems.  I had to replace the wiring harness. The parking brake light once stayed on whenever the truck was driven � regardless of whether or not the brake was set.  It was four months before the light inexplicably began to behave again.  The truck has trouble shifting into overdrive when the cruise is set.  Sometimes, it refuses to use first gear.  If you neglect to set the parking brake on a hill, the transmission will jam and the truck won�t shift out of park.  The buttons on the radio must be forcibly punched before they will work.  Preset buttons 2 and 3 don�t work anyway.  Pressing power to turn the radio off sometimes activates the tape deck.  If you pull on the cupholder too hard, it rips out of the console.

Dodge does, however, have a unique engine lineup.  With the exceptions of the Diamler 4.7L and the Cummins diesel, its engines use more gas to deliver less power that those of any manufacturer.  Though I drive a 2x4 and do lots of highway driving, I am lucky to get 13 mpg with my 5.2L Magnum V-8.  Power in the Dodges is passable, but fuel economy is atrocious.

The Dodge Ram is a great truck . . . when it runs.<br><br>
