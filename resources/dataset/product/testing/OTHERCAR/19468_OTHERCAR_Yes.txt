            This camera was purchased specifically to take on vacations and cruises because of the unlimited number of pictures that can be taken.  I say &quot;unlimited&quot; because unlike most of the other digital cameras on the market, pictures are stored on 3 1/2 inch floppy disks that can be purchased at low cost anywhere in the world. Literally, thousands of exposures can be stored in extremely small spaces.  As long as you are more than 6 feet from your subject, the camera is a dream.  However, Sony screwed up when it came to the flash.  Anything closer than 6 ft. is totally washed out when using the flash, and no suitable remedy exists. Sony's tech support suggests a lower exposure setting, but this does little to help. A finger over a portion of the flash window helps, but that makes for hit and miss exposures.  If flash is only used infrequently and at greater distances than 6 or 7 feet, the camera ia a little jewel. I liked it well enough to give it away and buy another Mavica, but this time an FD-83 which is essentially the same camera with a much improved flash that works well at almost all distances, and a faster recording system. If price is a factor and most of your pictures will be taken within the limits mentioned, this is a great camera.  If your purse will stand one of the newer models, go for it.<br><br>
