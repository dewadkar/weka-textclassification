            I bought his about 2-3 months ago, but only started to use it recently.  It is REALLY easy to use and understand that any beginner (even myself!) can learn to use it in 10 minutes.  Even connecting to your computer to download (with the manuals and software) your pictures is simple!  Even a novice computer user can do it.

The resolution of the pictures is 1280 x 1024 (I think...have to go check) which is really nice, and you can choose between three differnt settings (i.e. low, medium, and high quality)  Low quality isn't all that great (you can kinda make out the pixels), but medium and high quality are real nice (you can't REALLY tell the difference between medium and high on first glance, so take your vacation pictures at medium setting if you want more pictures)...but if you want to take a few pictures here and there and have access to your computer to download, then by all means, take the high quality pictures :)

I don't know why they have the option to turn red eye reduction and/or autofocus off.  I figure everyone always wants these features.  There aren't a whole lot of buttons and such to confuse someone.  So any of you who are those high-techie people who love looking at things with 1000000 gadgets and stuff, this isn't for you.  It's pretty dull aethestically speaking :)

Although I can go on and on about the pros of the camera, there are certainly some downsides towards it.

The battery for instance gets chewed up REALLY quick, so if and when you start downloading pictures, you better get an adapter.  HP really screwed their consumers on this because it would cost you $50 (yes, FIFTY) to buy their &quot;custom&quot; made adapter.  This camera takes 6V (standard), but takes an UNUSUALLY high amperage of 1.25A.  Most normal electronics store (i.e. Radio Shack) DO NOT carry such a rare item.  However, based on experience and such, you really dont need to get an adapter that takes that much amperage.  I bought a 6V 1.0A adapter for $15, and it was well worth it, espically now that I have a 64MB CF card that would take HOURS if it was full.  I have heard that a regular $7.99 6V and 300mA adapter will work downloading pictures, but dont take my word  for it :)

Furthermore, the camera comes with a 8MB CF card.  Although it's nice, 8MB just doesn't cut it.  You can barely take any high resolution pictures with it (only about 17 i think)...and then about 30+ medium resolution and like 60+ low resolution.  That's why I bought a 64MB :)

Well, that's about it. I'm sure there's more about this camera that I can talk about, but that's the gist of it<br><br>
