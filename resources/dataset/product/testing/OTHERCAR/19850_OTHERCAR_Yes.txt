            Sometimes you just Need a truck for light hauling but also Need a commuter
car so all your money doesn't go to making oil companies richer. The S-10 will fit the bill. I get 24-25 mpg (highway) with my daily commute which usually includes a tie-up or two. I do have a few bugaboos with Chevy, the cup holder is right next to your right leg so I keep the coffee in front of the middle divider and in the rain the water from the wipers comes in the window (I smoke so the window is open). The stereo system is very well designed, as is the climate controls and the two extra jacks electrical jacks were a good idea (I use one for the cell phone). One word of warning don't expect to use the middle seat for a third adult, it is tight, my youngest child is 15 and it is a laffer when she wants me to drive a friend home and the wife has the van at work. For just myself, driving to work and hauling stuff, I couldn't be happier with the S-10 and my three boys love driving it when they can, it has a lot of giddyup. I would suggest this vehicle to a family that allready has a van, and has some light or occasional hauling.<br><br>
