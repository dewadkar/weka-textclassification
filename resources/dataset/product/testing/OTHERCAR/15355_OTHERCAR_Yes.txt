            The Sony digital Mavica FD83 has its strong and weak points. I really like the control of the image but don't like the size which is too large. If you are looking for something simple to operate, be aware that this is  not a simple camera. Actually, it is not a  camera at all. 

The fact that a floppy  can hold up to 30 pictures is a great feature. You can also carry extra floppies in your pocket. Another nice attribute is the ability to quickly transfer the images from a disk to a PC with no wires. The image can be easily manipulated or deleted.

On the downside, the camera is quite large for its type and doesn't easily fit into a pocket (maybe a purse). If you run out of a floppy, it may be difficult to buy an extra one at the lake, sports event, or races. Another problem is that you really do have to read the instruction booklet to operate this gadget. Ugh! Otherwise, it is a really nice camera with the right amount of gadgets.<br><br>
