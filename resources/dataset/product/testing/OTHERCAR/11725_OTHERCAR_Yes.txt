            <b>LOOK BACK TO SEE THE FUTURE:</b>

If you are at all familiar with my automotive suspension reviews, you well know of my affinity for the <b>Honda</b> line of automobiles. They are some of the most reliable vehicles on the planet, and the suspension in particular is one of the Honda Motor Companies strong points. <b>Honda</b> was the imaginer, innovator, designer, and finally producer of, the world renown and oft-copied <b>Double Wishbone suspension</b>.

It seems these days almost every automobile manufacturer has some knock-off copy of the <b>Honda Double Wishbone</b>, and if imitation is actually the sincerest form of flattery, then the Honda engineers should feel duly flattered. In their quest for filling another niche in the ever increasingly fastidious market, Honda has morphed two of its best selling automobiles, injected it with a dose of steroids, and released it to the purchasing public.

I'm sure you well know of the legendary reliability factor of the Honda automobile it has never been an issue or even a secret, and in keeping with this tradition, and having the already competent resources at their disposal let Me <b>and</b> Honda introduce you to the <b>CR-V</b>.

<b>THE CR-V SUSPENSION:</b>

Of course the <b>CR-V</b> suspension is top notch. Even some of the oldest and most basic Honda cars are a study in how. How to build something to last, something you put your hundred thousand miles on, and pass it on to the next generation. If you were The Honda Motor Company would you even consider re-designing something that has served you so well just for the sake of doing it ? I didn't think so, and neither would I. Neither did Honda. This has proven to be the industry standard of front suspensions to date. This form has been around for decades already, and there has proven no rival to unseat it as king. Going into the year 2001 where Orwellian dreams of space travel and interplanetary colonization are the norm, it seems a suspension system designed that long ago would be obsolete. It is not, and that in and of itself is a testimony.

<b>Front:</b>

The front suspension of the Honda CR-V is more than just basically the Accord suspension, it <b>is</b> the Accord suspension. <i>(Though possibly not sharing actual parts, it is the exact representation of the Accord)</i> It is as mentioned of the double wishbone configuration. This is the most reliable type you can own, and it lends itself to smooth driving, low body lean cornering, and the most predictable steering feedback in any class. It is listed in many places as a coil spring/ strut type, but in all actuality the double wishbone really isn't a strut type but simply a variation of a coil over shock. Of course this is splitting hairs, but facts is facts.

To aid in the already admirable anti-roll, <i>or body lean</i> capabilities afforded by this suspension, there is a 26 millimeter diameter stabilizer bar <i>(roll bar, or more accurately anti-roll bar)</i> to keep things on the level. <i>More later on body lean.</i>

As with almost every other double wishbone from the Honda stable, the only front alignment angle adjustment offered is toe-in/ out. There are some copies of this suspension which offer camber adjustment so why the innovators of this design still haven't incorporated this into the control arms is a mystery. It would be simple and if done correctly would not compromise integrity, so please Honda engineers, take heed. Sure there are kits available, but one shouldn't have to bother.

The steering system is a variable assist, power rack and pinion unit which not only gives excellent feedback, but like all other Honda automobiles is an extremely light steering system. Feedback is instantaneous and though never recommended, can be handled with one finger. <i>(Do not try this at home nor anywhere else)</i>  Tie rods, both inner and outer are well made and the steering rack is mounted so that operation is mostly horizontal keeping steering induced stresses and angles to a minimum and parts wear follows, nil.

The springs are of top quality metals and well wound so breakage is a non-issue and the gas charged shocks equal this with premature wear never occurring warranting early replacement.

<b>Rear:</b>

The rear suspension though mimicking the Accord is more akin to the Civic in adjustability and lay-out. Of the same high quality as the Accord it is simply a matter of a difference in mounting points and where things go. It too is a double wishbone suspension and has the same top quality in springs, shocks and most everything the front offers. A 13 millimeter anti-roll bar graces the rear and actually for a rear bar is about average, Honda could have done better. 

One improvement over the Civic is the rear cradle where the suspension mounts. In the Civic the rear cradle, though adequate for its task is made of stamped steel and is moderately thin. The CR-V on the other hand, goes a step further with a <b>massive tubular steel</b> unit of impressive proportions. It may be the perceived manner in which this auto is thought likely to be used, but in any case, you want this strength in a suspension mount. It just looks like it can handle anything the driver can dish out.

In keeping with the only failure Honda has ever been accused of, just like the front, the rear is only toe adjustable. Unlike the Accord where the rear toe is adjusted via a set os fully surrounded cams, the CR-V like its cousin in the rear the Civic is toe adjusted via arms mounted in a slotted hole in the forward facing arm.

I don't like this for the simple reason it is <b>much easier to knock the alignment out</b> of spec with a blow than the cam method which will hold the alignment much better and is harder to upset.

<b>Body roll:</b>

Though the CR-V does yeomans work in the suspension system and every attempt is made to control handling, most specifically body roll, cornering lean, sway, or what have you, it is still a high vehicle and will give some the impression of instability especially compared to its cousins the Accord and Civic if pushed beyond its capabilities.

Ground clearance isn't impressive either, so if you are looking to this as a serious off-roader you better look elsewhere. It is much better utilized in its all wheel drive version for northern climates and hockey moms, to and from games and to the mall and back. It does an impressive job there, so keep this in mind. If this is the type of driving you are accustomed to, and you aren't serious about anything but asphalt and concrete, you have just found your new car !
