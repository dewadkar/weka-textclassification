            I had this vehicle for 2 1/2 years for a company car.  I specifically had the Cherokee Classic with 4.0l 6 cyl, auto, air, power everything.  I think that this is possibly one of the best vehicle buys on the market today.

Loves: VERY strong motor.  This motor has a ton of torque and pep.  Rugged Jeep feel.  This is definately a truck / off road vehicle not a family sedan with 4 wheel drive.  Call me crazy, but I love the 15 year old styling.

Hates: Rear passenger doors on the 4 door model are only useful for loading your golf clubs in the rear seat.  Passengers are GUARENTEED to get grease from the door latch on their pants while ATTEMPTING to get into and ouf of the Jeep.  I also had the fog lamp switch replaced 4 times under warranty and finally gave up.  It would burn up after about 20 hours of driving.

This vehicle is very fun to drive.  I never had it on SERIOUS off road duty, but did manage to get into two track and lots of mud and snow.  Living in Northern MI it did manage to get tons of exposure to deep snow and it performs flawlessly.  My only complaint is that the Jeep (and all DaimlerChrysler vehicles for that matter) are very noisy to drive.  You will certainly know that there is an engine bolted 3 feet from your head, and wind noise was always an issue.  Remedy... Turn the radio up! 

I'd buy another one of these in a second.
