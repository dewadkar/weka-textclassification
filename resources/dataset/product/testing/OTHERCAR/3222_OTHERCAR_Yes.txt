            When the time came to replace of my aging Ford Scorpio I was struggling to find something to fit the bill.  On the long motorway hauls the comfort and size was appreciated but I also yearned something a bit more exciting,  more reliable and of better quality.  Just as I'd given up finding a car that was the perfect balance I ended up, almost by accident, hiring a Mercedes C-200 Sport while on business.  After three days I was convinced I had to buy one..... so I did! :)

Anyone looking to buy now should be aware that the current C-class is on it's way out, with a new model being introduced in late 2000.  I like the existing model and chose to leverage the fact that dealers will be looking to offload stock before the new model arrives, making room for some healthy discounts.  However, anyone concerned about the effect on residual values as the new model launches and those who absolutely must have the &quot;latest thing&quot; might be better waiting until the end of the year to pick up the replacement.

The C-Class is surprisingly affordable, starting at little more than the price of well specified Ford equivalent in the UK. Reliability, glacial depreciation and high residual values for dealer-serviced cars make them excellent value for money.  This is reflected in Guaranteed Future Values offered by finance companies, making them an attractive PCP or lease option. Solid construction, safety and equipment levels cause it to weigh-in heavier than many other cars in it's class so you're likely to get on first name terms with the petrol station attendant very quickly if you tend to use your car mainly for trudging to the supermarket and back, but motorway consumption is reasonable with some engines delivering barely shy of 40mpg unless you're into fast lane drag racing. 

UK specification levels are respectable with all cars getting PAS, ABS, front/side airbags, ESP (traction control to the rest of us!) electric front/rear windows, electric heated mirrors, alarm/immobiliser and remote central locking as standard.  All but the C180 have aircon and the Sport and Elegance boast higher levels of refinement with leather gear level/steering wheel and alloys as standard. The Sport, desperately trying to break free of the &quot;old man&quot; heritage, is laiden with GTi-esque features such as lowered suspension, restyled skirts, sport seats and ivory instrument dials. The standard Mercedes 5-speed manual box is sloppy and due to be retired in favour of a new and supposedly improved 6-speed later this year, but mention this to a Mercedes salesman and they'll say something along the lines of &quot;oh, manual, yeah I saw one of those once... erm when was it now?&quot; - although listed as an option, almost all Mercedes cars roll out of the factory fitted with their superb 5-speed automatic transmission; recently given an design overhaul and given &quot;tiptronic&quot; gear shift, cruise control and speed limiter.

The C200 packs enough punch to provide some fun but lacks the excitement of the lighter cars in it's class.  Drivers who yearn for the adrenalin rush of a sub-10 second 0-60 might opt for the supercharged C230K which delivers more &quot;bang for buck&quot; with higher bhp than it's comparatively expensive and thirsty 2.4 V6 cousin, or the torquey 2.6 six-cylinder power plant of the C280.  If that's not enough there are the AMG variants which pack enough punch to satisfy even the most demanding performance fanatics.

Prices start a touch below 20,000UKP (approx $32,000) for the base C180 Classic and rise into the high 30K region for bigger engined and better specified models. Adding options that should really be standard can add a few thousand pounds and the more impulsive buyer can easily add 10K with the huge variety of factory or dealer fitted options available, ranging from fitted mats to GPS and AMG body styling.

The model I purchased, the C200 Sport, is listed at 25,040UKP on the road before options; or a touch shy of 28,000UKP as reviewed with tiptronic auto, Sony header unit, 10-disc CD changer and metallic paint.

Safety features are excellent; a good solid car which inspires confidence and PAS, ABS, EPS and front/side airbags as standard. For a heavy car it stops well so I'd be more concerned about the guy behind than hitting something in front.  Driver and front passenger ride in luxury with plenty of space and independent a/c controls.  Boot space is sufficient for a couple of large suitcases.  The driving experience is refined with the 2.0 litre 4 cyclinder 16v fuel-injected engine delivering a respectable 136bhp which, although unlikely to take your breath away, feels consistent and confident throughout the rev range. Tiptronic cruise control and speed limiter make light work of motorways and allow you to keep your eye on the road rather than the speedo in camera-infested areas. Get it on a country lane and it's different beast with the Sport models upgraded suspension giving surprisingly responsive handling. Heat-insulated windows prevent you from melting the moment you open the door in hot weather and aircon soon gets temperatures down to something comfortable. Build quality is typically German; solid and reliable but should the worse happen the quality of dealer service is second to none. Low depreciation will attract a private buyer looking to for something that will hold it's value or with reasonable finance repayments, while company car drivers get a lot of car for their allowance.

Rear passenger space has been compromised to gain the extra legroom at the front and boot space behind. Instrument layout isn't as well thought out as it might be, lacking the logical driver-orientated feel of a British of Japanese mass-production car. Standard audio is &quot;wanting&quot; with all models supplied only with radio/cassette - most drivers are likely to feel compelled to delve into the huge array of options including CD, minidisc and boot-mounted stackers. Glove box space is limited, having made way mostly to the passenger airbag, and door compartments are also small - although this is mostly made up for with plenty of space under the centre armrest. As is the trend with air conditioned cars, the standard spec now omits the sunroof and an electric tilt/slide breath of fresh air will set you back a not-inconsiderable 1200UKP.

In summary, an excellent car, offering the perfect balance between refinement and performance car handling.
