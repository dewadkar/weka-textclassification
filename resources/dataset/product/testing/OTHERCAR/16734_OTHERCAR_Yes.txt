            BMW 5 series, 2001

High Tech plus Comfort

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

For the fist part of a recent trip in Europe I rented a Saab, I was very pleased with this car, .then we continued our journey via Euro Rail for a while, crossed the Chunnel and visited London for several days. After returning to the main land again we need a new rental car. So this time I rented an automobile I had never driven before. A BMW Series 5 and to be more accurate a 540.

At first I was a bit surprised that it was 2001 model, it seems that I have seen this same model on the road for years, of course we all know that German car manufacturers and in this case Bavarian, do not change their models very often.

I asked the manager if he was aware of any new improvements on the 2001 model from the 2000. He said that esthetically BMW added some chrome and restyled the front and rear of the body. He also mentioned that this particular auto was equipped for the US market, He said that many of his clients will not only rent from him they will also buy the auto afterward and import to the United States.

He added that for the American market BMW added some inflatable safety cushions and also offer 2 new motors and the car I rented had one of the new designed engine being marketed.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The interior of the 540 is a combination of high tech controls and gauges plus super quality leather covering the seats, the dash and the door panels.

Sitting behind the steering wheel is very comfortable, all controls and analog gauges are well placed and can easily be reached and seen. Once you star the engine you feel the power of the 540 motor and it makes you feel really good.

The all around vision is excellent with the exception of the interior rear view mirror. I felt it could have been placed in a different position to offer a better view in the rear window.

The front seats are very comfortable and you have a good selection of adjustments to select from.

If there is one thing that I would change in the inside of this car, it is with the rear seats. Any medium size adult will feel a bit cramped in.

The sound system was excellent and it came with a CD player. I asked the manager if they all have CD players. He said no that it was option he ordered.

The exterior:

As I mentioned above, the exterior body appearance did not seem to have changed very much. Maybe it would be different with a connoisseur of BMW, but for me it seems that this model has been on the road for years.

Now nothing wrong with this, I think that it looks fine and it does not seem to be out dated. 

THE ROAD TEST

The 540 is equipped with an excellent suspension and this is obvious in any type of driving you may be doing. Within the city limits it is a very easy car to drive around. With the exception of the restricted view in the rear mirror, the rest of the vision from the driver&#146s position is excellent.

On the highway is where you can really appreciate the superior technology of this auto. It simply hugs the road as if the tires had a perpetual coat of glue on them. It was really fun to drive some of the smaller roads in Belgium, Luxemburg and Germany with this car.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION 

The &#147Beamer&#148 I rented was equipped in this manner.

Engine: A 6-cylinder, 3 liters motor developing 225 horsepower.
Transmission: 4-Speed automatic transmission.
Brakes: 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS.\\

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

Being that it was my first time driving a BMW, I must admit that I was really impressed by the automobile. It was a pleasure to drive and one should feel very safe in this car.
