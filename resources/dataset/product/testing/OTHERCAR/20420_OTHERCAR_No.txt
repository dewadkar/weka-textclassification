            Upon the advice of an Epinions advisor, I am posting this revised review of the 2000 Volkswagen Jetta GLS VR6 Sedan.

 

Overview and Purchase Experience
 

I purchased my 2000 VW Jetta GLS VR6 on February 25, 2003 from the local CarMax store in Greensboro, North Carolina.  The car was in excellent physical condition, with only a couple of minor paint scuffs and one ding.  The interior was likewise pristine.  The odomoter was just under 41,000 miles, so I considered that average mileage for a three-year-old car.

 

I was considering the Jetta along with a couple of Asian brands, one a &#14699; Honda Accord SE, the other a &#14600; Infiniti G20.  Test drives of all three revealed the Jetta to be a superior &#147driver&#146s car&#148.  While the Honda and Infiniti offered modestly-powered four-cylinder engines that produced no more than 140 or so horsepower, the Jetta offered six-cylinder power at a price lower than the other two vehicles.  As a bonus, it had a five-speed manual transmission.  I paid $14,998, the advertised price of the car, which represented a savings versus Blue Book retail of over $2,500.

 

My Jetta, as mentioned before, was a GLS model equipped with the VR6 engine.  For those unfamiliar with the VR6, it is essentially the same as a regular V6 engine, albeit with one cylinder head shared by the two banks of cylinders.  This is accomplished by narrowing the angle between the banks of cylinders to allow for more efficient packaging and fewer moving parts.  The motor, 2.8 liters in size, produces a respectable 174 horsepower and 181 pounds-feet of torque.

 

The Jetta also had a host of luxury features, including leather seating surfaces, the cold-weather package (heated washer nozzles, front seats, and side mirrors), and all the usual power accessories including a power sunroof.  The only item standard in most cars nowadays that was absent in the Jetta was a CD player; it had only a cassette player.

 

Styling and Design Assessment
 

Since its release, I have been a big fan of the current-generation Jetta&#146s styling.  Much of the appeal comes from the clever marketing techniques used by Volkswagen to lure buyers, including their catchy television commercials.  That notwithstanding, the Jetta is one of the most eye-catching designs on the road today.  With the wheels pushed out towards the corners of the car, it creates an aggressive stance not found on many other cars in its price range.  The overall design is one of functional elegance.  It appears that the designers made a concerted effort to eliminate surface excitement, evident in the absence of an excessive number of body panel seams and such.  Like the two generations of Jetta before it, the decklid sits higher in proportion to the rest of the body; this likely is the only gripe I have with the overall shape, though many sedans today present this profile.  Short overhangs front and rear allow for easy entry and exit of parking lots.  The wheels, simply designed six-spoke alloys, fill the wheel wells nicely and complete the sporty look.

 

Inside the Jetta is pure German function.  The materials used appear to be of very high quality, and they fit together well.  The center &#147stack&#148, consisting of the climate controls and stereo system, is angled towards the driver for easier access.  A meaty three-spoke steering wheel frames the complete instrument cluster nicely without blocking the gauges.  VW has chosen to use indigo backlighting with orange needles for the gauges; all other interior control lighting is red in color.  It is striking and makes for interesting conversation when guests are along for the ride.  A nice touch is the texture of the dashboard materials, a matte finish that diffuses light instead of reflecting it back onto the windshield.  The overall look is a triumph for the VW design team, especially in comparison to the dowdy interiors found in the second- and third-generation Jettas.

 

Fit, Finish, and Build Quality
 

Most of the exterior panels fit together very well, with the exception of the right side back passenger door which didn&#146t fit quite flush with the rest of the body when closed.  There was no excessive wind noise as a result, however.  The paint, silver in color, looked rich and deep with very little orange peel.  The paint on the alloy wheels appeared to be fading, however, at the time of purchase.  The doors, hood, and trunk all closed with a solid &#147thunk&#148 that was very satisfying; little effort was required as well.

 

Interior assembly quality was nearly flawless.  Controls and switches move with a high-quality feel that speaks of excellent engineering.  The hides used for the seats are carefully stitched and matched well.  On the road, the car rides quietly, albeit with some creaking now and then from the B-pillars when presented with uneven road surfaces.  VW has touted highly how stiff the Jetta&#146s structure is, though perhaps it is this excessive stiffness that does not allow for the required flexibility to eliminate creaking?  In any event, it is annoying and belies the otherwise solid build quality of the car.

 

Performance
 

The Jetta is about the same size as a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla, yet it is the only car in its class to offer a six-cylinder engine option.  As a result, the VW has no peer when it comes to power comparisons.  The VR6 offers loads of power and torque at virtually any engine speed, allowing for easy step-off with the 5-speed transmission.  Passing power is ample as well, with strong acceleration from any speed in any gear.  Few cars possess this quality and it inspires confidence.  The clutch is nicely weighted, and the stubby shifter offers precise if somewhat rubbery gear changes.  Quick shifts under hard acceleration from first to second gear are difficult, frequently resulting in a crunch of the gear syncros.  This is a seriously fast car.  The only problem I have is that there is very little soundtrack to go along with the driving experience.  Though the VR6 makes a nice burble when fired up on a cold morning, the rumble quickly fades as the engine warms up.  While quiet is good&#151the engine is so silent at idle it&#146s difficult to tell it&#146s running&#151there should be some &#147sturm und drang&#148 to accompany the involving driving experience.  I consider as the standard in this area to be the BMW 330i.  It offers an engine note that is menacing yet never intrusive, the perfect complement to the &#147ultimate driving&#148 experience.

 

The Jetta performs well in the curves, equipped with 16-inch wheels shod with Michelin Pilot tires.  The steering is nicely weighted and provides good feedback from the road surface.  Like many front-drive cars, the Jetta understeers, which is to say it would rather plow through a sharp curve at speed then negotiate it successfully.  It&#146s very controllable, however, using a combination of steering and throttle adjustments.  The VW is equipped with ASR, which stands for &#147anti-slip regulation&#148 if I&#146m not mistaken; as far as I could tell, it never interfered with day-to-day driving.  Ride quality is excellent over all surfaces, firm yet never harsh.  Braking, augmented by anti-lock control and discs on all four wheels, is likewise strong and reassuring.  I was particularly impressed with the Jetta&#146s resistance to nosedive when slowing from higher speeds.  It simply squatted, slowed, and stopped with little drama.

 

Utility
 

Utility and practicality is one of Jetta&#146s weak suits.  While the Jetta offers a large trunk, interior volume is compromised.  Three headrests are perched atop the back seat, implying that three-abreast seating of adults is possible.  Should three adults choose to sit back there, however, they will want to line up chiropractic appointments after the end of the trip.  Legroom is also deficient in the back, even with the front seats moved considerably forward, which is not likely because legroom in the front isn&#146t all that great, either.  The overall backseat situation is a function of the steeply raked back window glass, which would impede on headroom if the seatbacks were placed closer to the rear of the vehicle.  Though the car is equipped with a power sunroof that slides into the roof of the car rather than outside it, the Jetta offers ample headroom for most drivers and passengers.  Cupholders are provided for passengers in the front and back, but they are small in diameter and flimsy; expect them to snap to pieces at some point.  The glovebox is nearly useless, oddly-shaped and small in size.  VW provides a slot for insertion of the book-sized owners manual, but the manual doesn&#146t fit into it.  Storage space is skimpy, with a shallow compartment in the center armrest and pockets in the front doors only.

 

Reliability
 

A lot of people have the impression that Volkswagens offer reliability that is above average.  Most of those impressions come from the experiences of those who owned Beetles in the past, myself included.  After only a couple of weeks with the Jetta, however, that impression soon faded.

 

While one could say that buying a used car entails certain risks not associated with the purchase of a new vehicle, I felt confident (and still feel confident) that CarMax&#146s used car reconditioning process, along with a 30-day bumper-to-bumper warranty and five-day return policy, eliminated many of these concerns.  That having been said, the Jetta suffered from a number of problems that should not be expected from a vehicle with only 41,000 miles on the clock.

 

Approximately one week after buying the car, the Check Engine malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) illuminated.  Though there was no accompanying falloff in drivability, it did warrant a visit to CarMax.  They sent it to the local VW dealership, which diagnosed the problem as a misfire.  A new set of spark plugs corrected the problem, but only temporarily, as the MIL illuminated once more just a couple hundred miles down the road.  A mass air flow sensor was fingered as the culprit this time, again replaced and correcting the problem.  One day after this repair a clunking noise was noted from the front end.  Back to CarMax, and after a ride with one of their managers the car was sent to VW once more.  I also pointed out a whining noise made by the engine when first started in the morning.  The diagnosis this time was faulty struts on the front as well as a bad water pump.

 

The time frame for all these occurrences was roughly two weeks.  In warranty repairs, CarMax was out $2,000; I drove three different loaner vehicles over this period of time.  While the Jetta is easy to love, the affection quickly fades when shop visits become a weekly proposition.  As a result of these problems, CarMax and I came to an agreement whereby they would purchase the car back from me and allow me to purchase another.  It should be noted that CarMax was exceptionally professional and singly focused on my satisfaction, offering no resistance to my request to exchange the vehicle.

 

I should also point out, after doing extensive research of consumer opinion websites, that the Jetta, along with the New Beetle and Golf models, are Mexican-built, and are more problematic than their German-built sibling, the Passat.  I would recommend to prospective buyers that they visit as many websites as possible to gather the information necessary to make a sound purchase decision.  I have to admit that the Jetta was an impulse purchase&#151I had done my homework on the aforementioned Accord and G20, and after spending an evening to think about which one I would buy, I changed my mind the next day when I returned to CarMax and saw the Jetta, newly-arrived, on the lot.  Fortunately for me, I was able to undo my decision.  Buyers from dealers other than CarMax may not be so lucky should they find themselves in the same situation.

 

The Bottom Line
 

The Jetta provides a driving experience that simply cannot be found in comparable cars from Asian or domestic brands.  When equipped with the VR6, it offers performance comparable to cars costing thousands more.  This performance comes at the expense of practicality and reliability.  For somebody who drives only occasionally, or has the financial wherewithal to fund frequent trips to the shop for repairs, the Jetta may be the ticket.  A lot of folks love VW&#146s, and a strong affection for the brand is required to overcome the niggling quality issues that are likely to persist over the ownership period.  I would like to have continued owning the Jetta, but it simply became too much of a nuisance to take the car back for repairs of components that should simply not fail under normal wear and tear.  Perhaps I will give the VW brand another try somewhere down the road, but it will be with a German-built model when I make that decision.
