            The Element is exactly what it seems -- a comfortable box on wheels.  I bought the Element because, at times, I need to haul around things that would make carpet, seats, soft interior surfaces and, in short, most cars, pretty wrecked pretty fast.  

The Element offers a rugged interior surface, is plenty roomy and shaped the way things I tend to lug around are shaped.  The fold-up/removable rear seats and hosable interior surfaces take away the worry and need to cover the interior with canvas, etc. to move stuff.  In my case, this includes moving hay, trips to the dump with brush, moving goats, yes goats, and potentially other hauls that I would not want to put into a carpeted SUV.  The cargo doors (they are way too well-engineered to deserve the outdated title of "suicide door") are fine for everyday use and a packing dream.

The size of the Element is very pleasing as well.  I went from a 1991 Toyota Tercel and, while the exterior dimensions (width and length) are pretty similar, the height give lots of room without being a pain to park and maneuver.

The drive is fine, despite what others have written.  I suppose it's no luxury sedan, but it would be unrealistic to expect a sedan ride in a rolling cargo box.  It is perfectly comfortable.  It has plenty of pep.  We took it, one week out of the box, on a 900 mile round trip to Washington, DC with two 8 year olds.  The extra DC plug was used to plug in a DVD player, and the rear 'lounge' seats are huge, fully reclinable and have a cupholder each.  With tons of room for a big bag full of snacks and drinks on the floor, our kids were essentially in a living room on wheels.  At bedtime, they just grabbed their pillows from the 'way back,' reclined and went to sleep.  They got a kick out of seeing a jet fly over the sunroof (which is over the rear seats) when we went by the Newark airport.

I got the EX model, though I was shopping for the DX, but the cost of air added to the DX made the EX a better deal. I also ended up with the AWD (all wheel drive), which I wasn't shopping for, but was also a better deal based on a dealer advertised special.  The cruise control and radio are included with the EX and both are nice treats after my 12 year old Toyota.

The price we paid was based on a dealer advertised special with about a $1,600 discount and a $2,000.00 guaranteed trade.  My '91 trade had a wholesale retail value of about $300, so the price noted below is the price I paid PLUS $300 added for the value of my trade.

We are very happy with the Element, which is exactly what it appears to be.
