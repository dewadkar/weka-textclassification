            I have a 1996 Saturn SL1. Over the three years I've owned the car, I have been very pleased and would readily recommend a Saturn to someone else. When purchasing the Saturn one of the biggest plusses to purchasing a Saturn was that they used Blue Book value for my trade in and the price on the sticker of the car was the price you paid. Absolutely no haggling. Service has been excellent every time I've brought the car in. The car had needed some warranty work done, some of which was found by the dealer instead of me. I have also needed to replace the battery already. Saturns are a good medium sized car, even though it is still considered a compact. Everyone tells me they can't believe how much room there is in it. You can see some creative ways Saturn used to save some money -- such as the window controls in the center console so they didn't need to put them on each door. But overall, it seems to be a very solid car. Typical gas mileage is still around 28-30 MPG for the city and 32-34 MPG for highway. And my car gets a &quot;Birthday Card&quot; each year from Saturn!<br>
