              There is little to dislike about the Acura TL Type S--it is sleek, fast & powerful, combining a blend of luxury, style and performance that is tough to match at this price category.
   The 3.2 liter motor on the TL Type S is "massaged" to deliver 35 more horsepower and 16 more lbs./ft. torque (260 and 232) than the standard TL. Push your foot on the gas and you are gone--if Jean Luc Picard were in the car, he'd say, "ENGAGE!" Zero to sixty comes on in 6.5 seconds and it does the quarter mile in 14.8! This is excellent performance for a normally aspirated 6 cylinder motor. The engine is refined as well, and it is as smooth as it is powerful.
   Build quality is typically Honda quality, which is to say, very good. Doors shut without rattles, the interior is incredibly quiet, and the level of quality is excellent overall. 
   The amount of standard features boggles the mind; a comparably equipped BMW 330 would run around $38,000, but somehow Acura gives you a 6 CD changer, 5 speed automatic, power sunroof, and other amenities for a tad more than $30 thou. In fact the only option offered is a navigation system, which adds about $2k to the price. 
   If you are considering a near-luxury vehicle for around 30 grand, test-drive the Acura TL Type S. You just may fall in love with it--I did!
