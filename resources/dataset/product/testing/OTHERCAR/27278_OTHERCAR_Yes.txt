            This truck replaces a 2001 Sierra 1500.  Basically the same truck as in the title only the new is the 2500HD.  Have camper now, needed more of a truck.
This GMC HD (Heavy Duty) comes standard with the 6 liter engine.  This is a 300 HP engine.  It runs very quiet and smooth.  The power can be felt from the get go due to the optional 4:10 gears.  The truck runs at 65 MPH at 1900 RPM's.  If features a nice throaty voice and a huge diameter tail pipe.  
Haven't run a full tank of fuel through yet to get Mileage.  
This truck has the Eaton locking rear end.  I have used it today while turning around in a snowy driveway.  a few milliseconds after the wheel begins to spin on ice, the locker kicks in with a thud and the other wheel
grabs.  If you were considering a 4 wheel drive vehicle but decided that you didn't want to go to the expense of that option, I would recommend the eaton Locker.  This certainly does not replace 4 wheel drive but it really can be a big help when sliding.  
The Quality of this truck seems as good as the 2001.  The fit and finish are also good.
I have found two minor issues that will require a return trip to the dealership.  A small dent at the top of the box, and the bumper was not installed level.
If this truck is as reliable as the last it will be another great truck that I hope to have for many years.
The whole GMC purchasing process when very smoothly and with today's discounts I was offered a 750. discount and a 3500. discount.
This appears to be a good time to purchase a new truck
