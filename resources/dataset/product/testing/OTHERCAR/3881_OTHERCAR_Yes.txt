            I leased my 1999 Plymouth Voyager in March of 1999. My husband and I had just had our second child, and we were quickly realizing that we needed a larger vehicle.  We traded in our 1999 VW Jetta on our Voyager.  We went with a short wheelbase base model.  We got dual sliding doors, integrated child seats, a rear power outlet and a rear wiper.  I think that is the extent of the options we got, but we are very happy with this minivan, nonetheless.

I love the fact that the bench seats are so versatile.  

**They are completely removeable.  This allows us to remove them for throroughly vacuuming the van.  We also can remove just the rear-most seat and this allows us to transport large items or a lot of little items.  

**Both seats also can slide more toward the front of the van....or toward the back.  If we need more leg room for occasional adult passengers, we move the middle bench seat forward and move the rear one back.  This creates maximum leg room for our passengers.

**The rear most bench seat can fold down to allow for more room.  It also has handy grocery back hooks on the back of it, so our stowed groceries don't roll around while we drive home.  

This van has a lot of other convenience features:

**There is a handy second power outlet (formerly known as a cigarette lighter!) behind the rear most seat.  This allows us to keep a DC cooler back there and we are always stocked with cool bottled water and drinks!

**We got a &quot;non-smokers&quot; package and instead of ashtrays, we got some extra little storage compartments! This comes in handy, since I have a lot of stuff!

**We got the under-seat storage drawer that rolls out from under the front passenger seat.  This is a handy storage area that locks for extra security.

**There are plenty of cupholders throughout the van, and most are adjustable and can accomodate small cups, cans, large cups, handled mugs, etc.  Even a 44oz drink will fit in most of them!

I am really impressed with how this van drives and handles.  It has a very smooth ride and drives very much like a sedan.  It felt funny to drive it in the very beginning, but within a week or so, it felt just like a car. 

The upholstery on the seats feels soft and plush, yet is durable and very easy to clean.  The carpet is also plush, but not so plush that it's impossible to get the crumbs out of it when I vacuum it.  (With my kids, this is important!)

The integrated childseat is perfect for my five-year old and has been perfect for her since we got the van.  It is designed for children who are 22 pounds or more and ready to be forward-facing, but I do not use it for my 24lb. 14 month old.  I tried him in it, but it just doesn't seem as secure for such a small child, since it does not provide any head, neck or side support.  I anticipate that he will start using it at around two, when he doesn't fit totally comfortably in his convertible safety seat anymore.

I have a four-cylinder engine.  That's one thing I would change.  I could use a little more power for merging on the freeway in certain areas where the on-ramp is only about ten feet long.  In most situations this isn't an issue.  The engine I have isn't too bad...with good timing I can pass easily and get some power when I need it.  I only get about 20mpg on the highway....I think this is because I floor it a lot to get the power I need.  I feel I would get similar fuel economy with the V-6 engine.

There are a couple of safety issues that detract from how safe I feel in my van.  The contour of the front seats does not provide any head or neck support.  This is something that I consider a real drawback....I don't feel like my neck is protected from whiplash at all.  I also don't have tilt-wheel and I feel that the steering wheel points up at my head on a dangerous angle should my airbag ever deploy.  Since I am only 5'5&quot;, I sit as far back as I can to try and minimize this danger.  These two issues are things that would keep me from getting another Chrysler minivan in the future.  I am hoping these issues will be corrected before I am ready to replace this van at the end of my lease.  If not, I would probably have to go to another brand.

Overall, though, I really love my Plymouth Voyager and I would recommend it to friends.  (I would advise that if you plan on regularly having passengers in the rear-most seat, that you get the long version.)  I think that for the price, you get a lot of space, functionality and extras.  It's a pleasure to transport our family in and I am sure we will continue to enjoy it for the next two years.
