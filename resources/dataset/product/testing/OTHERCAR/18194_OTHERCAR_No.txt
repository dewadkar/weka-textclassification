            My husband and I bought our 1996 Pathfinder SE 4X4 new in March 1997. Since then, we have had so many problems, I don't know where they start and where they end. Currently, the P.O.S. has about 52,000 miles. Thus far we have had:

Replaced SRS control unit 17,862mi
Heater stopped working 17,862mi 
Shocks & struts flattened out 18,000mi, again at 40,000mi
CD player broken 12,000mi
Factory window tinting peeling off 45,000mi
Rear differential replaced 18,212mi
Front bearings died 30,000mi
Road noise (sounds like windows are flying off) 55mph
All 8 control arm bushings failed (rubber turned to liquid and dripped out) 50,000mi
Steering wheel misaligned- as driven off lot

If you like having something to drain your extra hard earned cash on- buy a Pathfinder! It seems as though not even Nissan is willing to stand behind their own product. The dealership is growing tired of us, and I've about had it with them. We have finally put it up for sale, now that it is "safe," and can't wait to get rid of it. My new mechanic advised that in the future, it's worth it to pay the difference for a Toyota. I have filed complaints with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. I do NOT reccomend this SUV to anyone. If this message changes one person's mind from purchasing a Pathfinder, then it was worth my effort to reiterate my frustrations yet again.
