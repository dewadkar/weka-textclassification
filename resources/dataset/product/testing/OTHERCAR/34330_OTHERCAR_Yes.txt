            I purchased my Acura in October 1999 after considering many sedans in and out of its class.  I drove a BMW 323, Lexus ES, Lincon LS, Honda Accord, Ford Taurus, Ford Contour SVT and a few others.  What my decision came down to was the very solid value that the Acura brought for a car that cost me around $28,000.  

The engine is very powerful, the handling excellent, the overall fit and finish excellent and the compliments frequent.  After owning only American branded cars during my life, I've discovered why so many gravitate towards the Japanese luxury brands.  My favorite part of the car is it's power - both off the line and especially during highway driving.  I often find myself humming along at 90 MPH without really trying.  I find that the car is excellent for carting adult and child passengers - its interior room is very good. The BOSE audio system has excellent sound and is easy to use.  The heating and A/C has a climate control temperature setting which works perfectly - I set it at 68 degrees and hardly ever touch it. 

The downside is that the bucket seats probably are too contoured for a man who is my size or larger (6.0 ft, 200 lbs.) In long drives, the backs of my legs start to tire - something that probably shouldn't happen in a perfect car.  <br><br>
