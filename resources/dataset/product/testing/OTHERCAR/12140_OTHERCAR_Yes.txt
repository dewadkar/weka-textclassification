            I own a 1993 Honda Prelude VTEC.  It is beautiful and the best part is that it still runs strong.  Honda really makes good cars and the thing about the prelude is that it's fast and well built.  I can blow my friends 1995 Camaro off the street.  And I haven't seen many mustangs that can take me either.  

The great thing about it is that you can burst off the line like a NASA rocket, but unlike Camaros and Mustangs, it handles the back-country curvy roads like a race car.  Mine is also lowered and has improved suspension, so I am a little spoiled, but in general they are very good cars.  So if you want speed and great handling, buy a prelude!  Mine is for sale.<br><br>
