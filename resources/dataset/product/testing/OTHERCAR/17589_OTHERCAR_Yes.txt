            I bought my white 1998 Plymouth Neon Highline about two years ago. A rental return, the car had about 26,000 miles on it at the time, which seemed high to me. But it still seemed rather new and pristine, and it checked out with my mechanic, and the price was right, so my Neon and I hit the road together. I bought the car for about $9,000. Now, more than 40,000 miles later, I have little to complain about. My Neon's been a good little soldier. 

The Neon is what it is: An affordable compact passenger sedan. It's not a European luxury car, and it's not a sports car. It is, however, fairly good-looking, fairly roomy, fairly reliable, and fairly efficient. It's an economy car, and a pretty decent one. Therefore I will judge it in its own class, and give it four stars in comparison with its competition -- let's say the Ford Escort, Toyota Corolla, Chevy Cavalier, Nissan Sentra, etc., etc.

All Neons of that time period came with one of two engines, a single overhead cam 132-horsepower four-cylinder, or a double-OHC 150-hp four. Mine is the 132-hp version, and I must say, it is quite adequate for the job. Merging into traffic is easy enough, if you don't mind a little good-natured roar from the engine. The engine itself is fairly well-mannered; not too loud and not too soft. It's got that characteristic buzzy sound at high rpm's that can usually be found in American four-cylinders of its ilk, but it's not too obtrusive. 

Braking and handling are pretty good for a front-wheel drive car of this type. The car develops some understeer at high speeds, but you're probably not going to drive the Daytona 500 in it. It's fine for everyday driving, and handles better than most cars I've driven in its class. 

The three-speed automatic transmission is adequate. Punch the accelerator and you'll get an immediate downshift at medium speed, and then a relatively smooth upshift down the line. However, there is no overdrive, which means that highway fuel economy isn't as good as it could be. In fact, my fuel economy has been less than wonderful, as I get an average of 24-26 mpg. The car is rated about 27-41. I've never seen that kind of mileage -- not even right after a tune up. 

The ride of the car is adequate, if a bit stiff. The seats are hard, which can get a bit annoying on longish trips. In fact, my girl doesn't like riding in my car at all, as she says it makes her carsick. I guess the combination of stiff ride and firm seats is too harsh for her. That's something to keep in mind if you've got a sensitive stomach. In contrast, her Escort has a much softer ride and seats. Personally, I prefer the firmer support and ride of the Neon. 

The interior is fairly nice for a car of this price class. Yeah, there's a lot of plastic, but it's nicely textured and doesn't look too cheap. Some dashboards have a shiny, reflective look to them that suggests low quality, but the Neon's seems to absorb light. The cloth upholstery is soft and comfortable. The back seats can fit two adults, but not for any length of time.

The stereo is actually pretty good -- it has six speakers and good surrounding stereo sound. Distortion is low even at fairly high volumes, and the tape deck has a functional music seek feature that I use all the time. Controls for the stereo and other features are intuitive and have a well-put-together feel to them. I especially like the steering-wheel buttons for the cruise control (which our Escort doesn't even have -- and it's the high-end model). 

As for reliability, I have had only one major problem with the car. At about 35,000 miles I developed an oil leak and discovered that my headgasket was bad. Thankfully, this was covered by my extended warranty, but if I hadn't had one, this could have been an expensive repair. (An aside: If you ever hear of an extended warranty company called &quot;First Extended&quot;, run away as fast as you can. I wrangled with them for a month to get my repair paid for.) Almost every other repair or service has been minor and inexpensive. Parts for the car are relatively easy to come by, though don't try to get spark-plug wires for it. Apparently, retail parts stores don't carry them, only dealers and garages. 

All in all, the Neon is a good little automobile. It's well-mannered, reasonably comfortable, fleet-footed, and even looks good. It's got a clean line to it, and the little round headlights make for a friendly visage. I'd recommend the car to people looking for an affordable ride with a little personality. <br><br>
