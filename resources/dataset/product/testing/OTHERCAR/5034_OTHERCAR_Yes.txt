            I love my car!  And I haven't said that in at least 15 years.

I had owned a Chrysler Sebring coupe for less than 2 years.  Chrysler is a luxury marque, but my car was anything but luxurious.  It had the right appointments, but gave a harsh ride and was impossible for a middle-aged man to get in and out of.

I had rented a Buick Regal for a few days while on vacation and really enjoyed the ride.  I went in search of one locally.  Not only did I find my car, but it has all the bells and whistles -- leather (which I thought I wouldn't like, but I also have the heated seats and that makes winter more than bearable!), moonroof, Monsoon stereo CD/Cassette, etc., etc.  I don't think I missed any accessories.

The Buick Regal is no Honda or Toyota.  It doesn't handle like one.  It handles and drives like a true American car -- the kind I drove growing up.  This car could be sold in Cadillac showrooms and people would buy them up by the thousands.  But because it isn't a Cadillac, the cost is reasonable -- the list on my car was over $26,000; I paid about $23,000 including an internet rebate.  

I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a near-luxury sedan.<br><br>
