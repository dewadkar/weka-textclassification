            When I  went car shopping for a second vehicle I was looking for something to get me around town, back and forth to work and, if needed, the vehicle had to  blaze a trail during the winters here in Western New York.  I settled on a Tracker and 4 years later I am still grinning.  Not only has the vehicle gotten me around town and back and forth to work easily and economically, it has stood up to the snow and ice through any winter weather.  The ease of &quot;popping&quot; it into 4 wheel drive is just one more thing that makes it a joy to own.  I had been told that a Tracker rolls over easily because of the shorter wheel base but I felt, and still feel, that if one drives sensibly and is aware of the turning capabilities one will be safe.  While my sons were driving it from Cleveland at Christmas time 3 years ago they hit  black ice on an expressway, the Tracker spun out of control, went over a snow bank and flipped over 360 degrees. The damage was mostly cosmetic and even with it being a soft top they both walked away unharmed, thanks to their seatbelts and the roll bar.  Two mechanics looked at it and were most impressed with how little damaged it sustained  and the fact that the roll bar did not collapse. I recommended it to a co-worker who has since bought one and is enjoying it. <br><br>
