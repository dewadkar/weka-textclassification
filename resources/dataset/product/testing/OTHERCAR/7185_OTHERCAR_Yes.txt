            I bought my 96 Maxima in 2001 with 93K miles.

Consumer Reports predicted excellent reliability for this car and I also loved this car's styling - which is why I bought it.

This review will describe my observations after using this car for 2.5 years and driving 21K miles.  So, I will start with the Pros:

- Reliability exceeded my expectations!  I did not have ANY mechanical Failures over the 2.5 years of driving.  This car has a true Japanese build quality - no doubts about it!

Maintenance was my only expense - I changed oil every 3K miles at Jiffylube ( $30 each ), changed transmission fluid once ( $60 ), changed one of the belts ( $50 ), and did one tune-up ( $260 ).  

- V6 is simply out of this world!  After years of driving many cars, I started appreciating the silky-smooth and Very powerfull V6 of Nissan Maxima!  The engine has enormous power when pushed to the limits, yet it always sounds pleasant and smooth.  

Transmission also performs very well, especially considering the 115K milage.  Passing on the highway is easy - transmission downshifts when necessary and provides plenty of passing power to the wheels.  
Accelleration from a complete stop is effortless and the transmission shifts quickly and smoothly.  
When the car is moving around 5mph, there is some minor delay in the downshift time, when trying to accelerate - but that is expected and is a not a problem.

-Rear seats are very comfortable and provide excellent support.  They are good for short/long trips.  Leg room and head room is also very generous in the back.

-Styling.  I think the styling is excellent and best of all- it's somewhat classic, which means the styling ages very slowly.  After observing Maxima since 1995 on the roads - I still think it has a very pleasing design.

-Instruments.  Most are clearly laid out and make sense.  The speedometer and rpms are easy to read and the tilted wheel really helps.  Overall, the design of the instrument panel looks very pleasing and modern.  

The only control, which is oddly placed is the power mirror joystick.  For some reason it's on the left side of the panel, as opposed to the driver's door.  This is very minor problem, because I only need to setup the mirrors once a year.

-Gas milage is good given the 3.0 liter size of V6. I average a respectable 23-25 on the highway.  
Driving in Brooklyn is usually a lot less efficient, where I average 14-15 mpg - due to heavy traffic and tons of traffic lights.  Since Brooklyn probably provides the most extreme conditions of city driving, I would not use it as a good source of city milage information.  

-Fit and finish are top quality.  After 7 years on the road, the panels in my Maxima do not vibrate or rattle.  

Cons: 
-handling.  Maxima is more of a family sedan and not a sports car, so don't expect a BMW handling.  But don't worry - what you lose at handling you gain at reliability - just check out Consumer Reports on BMW vs Nissan reliability records!

-Front Seat comfort.  Front seats provide decent support, however, they are not always comfortable on long trips.  This is not a problem for me because I usually drive 1 hour a day in city traffic.
