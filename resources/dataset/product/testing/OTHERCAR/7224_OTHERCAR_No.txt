            In 2000 my wife and I traded in her trusty Honda Civic for a 1999 Mercury Cougar with low miles. The price was right for a car with so many options. My wife loved the way it looked, so we took it home.

In the last two years, the car has performed well with the exception of a few quirks covered under warranty. A few problems that prompted dealer attention were fogged up headlight lenses, leaking rear window washer hose, rear hatch that refused to release, and alternator light coming on during hard accleration. None of these were serious, but still an inconvenience when you have to arrange for warranty repairs.

The car handles well, stops fairly well dispite non-ABS rear drum brakes on my model, and gets very good fuel mileage on the highway. Which brings me to my main complaint, the base model seats are awful. They will have your hind parts in throbbing pain long before you run out of gas. Besides the awful seats, the V-6 engine is pretty weak when mated with the automatic transmission. Tall gearing gets you good fuel mileage, but lack luster performance is the tradeoff. 

Would I buy another Cougar if they were still being made? Probably not. I'm not overly impressed with the car, but not displeased with it either. It's simply an "average" car. Nothing too good, and nothing too bad. It's simply not as good as the competition from Toyota, Honda, and Acura. 

I've always liked Ford products, and I think they've made a good decision to scrap this model and concentrate on the Focus instead.
