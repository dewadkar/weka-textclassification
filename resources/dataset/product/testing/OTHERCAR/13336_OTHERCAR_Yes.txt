             My husband was looking for a car to take him to &amp; from work. We were looking at different used cars, and being &quot;die-hard&quot; Chevy people, he was drawn to this particular car. 
 The owner was asking $1000.00 for it, but he had gotten into an accident (was rear-ended at a red light) and it had close to $2500 worth of damage to it. We got the owner to go down to $600, but when we went to take it for a test drive, found out the clutch was blown. So, since my husband is able to fix most mechanical problems, we bought it (for $400).
 This particular car is the 1990 Beretta 5-speed, it only has the basic package in it, so, no a/c or power windows in this car! But for the price we paid (plus an additional $60 to fix the clutch) we've had no complaints! 
 It is roomy enough in the back to fit a booster car seat and a convertable car seat (we have a 14 month old and a 2 1/2 year old) and still have room for another person between the car seats! There is enough leg room in the front, and, as long as you dont have the front seats reclined ANY, there is leg room in the back, too. BUT, if you recline either front seat, there isnt too much room in the back (one downfall). The trunk is HUGE! Its roomy enough for a double stroller, a portable high chair, AND room for a weeks worth of groceries for a family of four!
 Even though I dont like small cars, I highly rate this one as it is a good car for the price.In the three years we've owned it, the only thing we had to fix was the clutch.The car now has 125,000 miles on it, and is STILL going strong! The only problem *I* have with it, is it is 5-speed, and I'm not too good with driving standard shift cars.<br><br>
