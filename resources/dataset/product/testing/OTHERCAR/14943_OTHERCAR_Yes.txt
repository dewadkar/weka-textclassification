            As an old photography hobbiest for the past 30+ years I've owned most cameras on the market from instamatics to Polaroids to professional 35mm equipment including Nikon and Canon. I still have an old fashioned &quot;dark room&quot; despite the fact that I also use Adobe Photoshop. If it has to do with photography- I've done it.

When I decided it was time to explore digital photography I began investigating. Now understand... I'm not yet convinced that digital photography will ever replace the luscious smooth emulsion of chrome slide films- nor am I sure I want it to. But I think it's wonderful for emailing snapshots, manipulating photos quickly, documenting home contents, online auctions and 1001 other uses. I wasn't looking for &quot;perfect images&quot;... I was looking for &quot;quick and easy!&quot;

The problem with most digital cameras is they use obscenely expensive memory sticks, chips, packets, etc. The second problem is that you have to have either a dedicated docking port configured to upload photos to your computer- or else turn your computer around and begin unplugging and plugging in various cords and ports- hoping it will reconfigure properly to allow you to upload that photo to email aunt Matilda. Good luck!!

Sony's brilliance lies in the &quot;gee-why-didn't-I-think-of-that&quot; use of cheap, compact floppy disks for storage- and using the same diskettes to directly allow access to any computer, anywhere, anytime without having to configure ports and plug in cords.

I've had my Mavica for close to 2 years now and have never had a problem with it. It's done all that I hoped and then some. It's as dependable as a hammer- always ready for a quick snapshot. And if you need to take a lot of pictures...just grab a fist full of diskettes and you're in business. Want to share with a friend? It even duplicates it's own diskettes on the spot- brilliant idea!!

So... if you're wanting to be the next Ansel Adams you probably don't want digital anyway. If you're looking for quick, convenient and dependable- you won't be disappointed. As the Italians say.. &quot;Mavica!&quot;<br><br>
