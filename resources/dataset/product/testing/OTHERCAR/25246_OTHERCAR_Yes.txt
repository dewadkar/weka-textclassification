            Add it up: German Engineering, famous Quattro all-wheel drive, airbag, anti-lock brakes, many luxury amenities (heated, adjustable leather seats with 4-position memory, trip computer, multi-position power sunroof, etc.), good reliability, excellent handling, great looks. Sounds pretty good, no?

Perhaps I should have waited to write this review until after I actually bought the car, but I felt compelled to share some thoughts on this versatile example of the epitome of luxury sports coupe.

The Quattro heritage can be traced back to the early 80's when Audi was struggling to find their place amidst the offerings of the other more famous German big 3 - BMW, Mercedes, Porsche. They had sold a recent potential big hit to Porsche in the mid-seventies which would have certainly peaked potential buyer's interest - a joint venture with VW which would become the Porsche 924. The entry-level offerings from BMW were also formidable, including the affordable and popular 320i. So Audi needed a big hit of their own - they turned to the World Rally circuit.

To make a short story long :) I'll skip the rest of the story and tell you that through tremendous success in rallying, Audi developed and perfected the Quattro all-time, all-wheel drive system for it's passenger vehicles. The Coupe in particular received a great deal of attention because it was the first test bed and was the sportiest of the lot. 

After a successful period of selling Quattro Coupes in the early to mid 80's, there was a discontinuation of the model until 1990 when an entirely different vehicle emerged. The more sophisticated coupe sported the 20V 164 hp engine as well as more compact and handsome good looks. Other important features (as mentioned above) included a driver's side airbag and anti-lock brakes, excellent safety features for that era. Unfortunately, the trip for the Audi Quattro Coupe would be short-lived - only 2 years (1990-1991). It would be replaced by the sleek S2 a couple of years later.

Expensive problems for the 1990-1991 Quattro Coupes included timing belt failure (make sure that you change the timing belt and chain before the recommended service interval of 90K miles - most shops recommend 60K); the 
&quot;bomb&quot; failure - a hydraulic pressure accumulator which affects the steering; leaks of the hydraulic fluid; A/C leaks; Clutch and slave cylinder; and the radiator and fan tend to fail prematurely. For an excellent web site detailing the pros and cons of the 20v Audi - see http://www.20v.org.

The split fold-down rear seats and ski boot are nice interior features. The leather heated seats are fantastic. Unfortunately, the rest of the interior is disappointingly clumsy and not very well designed. The climate controls seem terribly out of place - like something out of a Dodge Dynasty (very 80's Detroit-ish). The same can be said for the adjustable seat controls - I'd swear they were lifted from a Crown Victoria. The stereo controls are fairly accessible, although the gauge pod at the bottom of the center console is the worst display placement I've seen since the Three-Mile Island disaster. Clearly, Audi was not educated in dashboard layout ergonomics and usability at that time. The other annoying Audi habit of putting the pedal cluster too far to the right of the driver along with using 2 digits to display the RPMs were other blatant examples of the lack of a good Human Factors Engineering program.

On the other hand, drivability is good, but you really have to keep the revs up. This coupe pulls of the line like a diesel Rabbit, but keep your foot into the pedal until 5000 rpm or so and you'll be rewarded with a healthy dose of longitudinal g's. Like many late-model Asian imports, this engine likes to rev high and with a redline of 7000 there's plenty of power at the top end. Body roll is mild compared to the older coupes, helped out somewhat by the wider 205/60/15 tires (80's coupes had stock 195/60/14's). Of course, the aftermarket is teeming with upgrades for the suspension and engine. All in all, it seems like a fantastic car, albeit rare. A quick search on Classifieds2000 resulted in only one example in about a 300 mile radius. I'll have more data to report if (when) I buy the car at the end of the year.
