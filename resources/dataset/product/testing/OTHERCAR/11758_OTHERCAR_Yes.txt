            Now that digital cameras are here to stay, it's nice to try find one that's a cheap price and actually worth a darn. After doing massive amounts of research on looking for a digital camera under $200, I finally decided on the Kodak DC3200, and it's got a features list that even match more expensive cameras, but at a cheaper price. After reading a lot of good material, I took the dive on this camera. 

After owning it for a couple months, I am pleased by its quality, but annoyed by its problems. I don't regret it thought. Immediately who you start using the camera, it could not be any easier to use. You just turn on, point, click and shoot (but you sometimes have to hold for 2 seconds for the shot to be taken). It includes a menu system that's extremely easy to navigate if you want to preview photos, see a slideshow, or format the memory card. 

When you purchase the camera, you notice that it comes with a preview LCD screen so you can watch your shots, and even preview them (but can't delete certain photos to save on memory space) after you take the shots. The quality of the shots have been outstanding, with 1280x960 quality with over 1 Meg in megapixels with rich & detailed colors hich are excellent to e-mail or print out as they are in JPG compression. The camera does have a 2x zoom feature, but no auto-focus or zoom-in if you want high quality shots. This isn't intended to be a professional camera, but it's just right for taking personal photos.

After you take the shots, and you want to upload the shots to your PC, you use the Kodak software and your parallel port to put them on your PC. Just turn to the menu system, choice PC CONNECT, start up the software, and preview the pictures on the PC. If you want to edit your pictures, forget it. This comes with Kodak Picture Now, which is just a Macromedia picture editor, and completely abysmal in handling photos. Be sure to get something better (I use Adobe PhotoDeluxe that came with my scanner to edit and print) in photo editing.

In order to keep the price low,some features are missing. This camera only comes with 2MB of Internal Flash Memory. Unless you buy a CompactFlash card, this does cut it. You can choice between 3 different quality of photos, Good, Better & Best. With only 2MB of memory, on Best setting, you can only take up to 5 photos before the memory is full. Another huge hassle is that this thing sucks battery life like no tomorrow. Using typical Energizer batteries, this camera would only last me up to 25-45 minutes, running on 4 batteries before it dies on me, usually taking up about 20 pictures. This was also with preview picture LCD screen turned on. If you turn off the LCD, it lasts a lot longer. The last annoying thing is the flash. It is blinding, and regularly it'd washout an item. You can set it to different settings, but many times I'd just turn it off unless it's in the dark.

For someone looking for a cheap & easy to use digital camera, and don't need the frills, this is just right. camera to get. If you can look past its shortcomings, this is just the right camera to snap photos and print them yourself or e-mail them to people. So far been satisfied, for all that is given to me in this camera.
