            I am the proud owner of the Honda S2000. This car is simply awesome!! If your looking for a fast, sports car this is the one for you. This car looks great and performs great too. Some of the interior features are, Power windows, power locks, cruise control, map lights, digital instrument panel, aluminum shift knob, beverage holder and the best one...engine start button. It is a six speed, short shift and is really fun to drive. The top comes down very easily and fast. This is simply an awesome car. The only bad thing I could possibly say is that the stereo is not too good. It's just your basic Honda stereo. It has a cd player but the sound is just not up to par. But other than that there is nothing bad I can say about this car. It is outstanding!!!!!!
