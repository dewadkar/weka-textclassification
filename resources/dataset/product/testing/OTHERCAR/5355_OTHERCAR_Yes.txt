            The title says it all.  I love my Lexus!  Let me start by saying that I'm not the &quot;luxury car&quot; type.  When my daughter was born, it was time for us to get a second car.  My husband and I studied all the consumer magazines and came up with a list of about 6 cars that would meet our requirements for safety, comfort, reliability.  The Lexus ES300 met all of these requirements beautifully, so we went to a local dealership and looked at a previously owned 1995 model.  We fell in love!  Not only is this car reliable, safe,and extremely comfortable but the ride is wonderful.  The elegant leather seats and good looks of the car are merely added bonuses.  We've had the car for two years now and have had absolutely no mechanical problems with it.  We are very happy.<br><br>
