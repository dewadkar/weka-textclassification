                 <b>F</b>or many individuals who want the refined/meaty performance associated with the M Roadster, but the practicality of a 3 door coupe, The BMW M Coupe is perfect. It is just as fast as the convertible, but thanks to its much stiffer structure, the M Coupe handles even better!


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

   What happens when you add a full roof to the Z3? In the case of the M Coupe hatchback it makes the car around 3 times stiffer, sharpening up the car's responses dramatically. The M Coupe can handle any situation on the back-roads. Turn in is excellent, and body lean is next to none even with extreme aggressive driving. The feel is always safe, and well behaved, it gives the driver a feeling of flattery as he or she accomplishes some of the most daring roads. There's surprisingly strong understeer and it takes real effort to kick the tail out under full power (and it's impossible when the traction control is switched on). 

<b>Braking</b> is superb, the 4-wheel disc brakes mated with 4-wheel ABS brings this sporty BMW to a stop with full confidence. All this handling and good braking is not matched with no anemic engine. 

<b>Under the hood</b> there is a 3.2 liter 240 horsepower  6-cylinder power plant! Acceleration to 60 can be had from a standing start in just 5 seconds (according to specs). Acceleration comes so fast and with so much refinement that speeds of 60 MPH can be reached with very little throttle, and without hearing the engine whine in agony. Instead, the dual exhaust is meaty sounding  as if there is a much larger engine under the M Coupe's hood.  

   The <b>engine</b> in the M Coupe is an iron block alloy head 3.2 liter 6-cylinder, this engine was used in the old M3s. There are twin chain-driven overhead camshafts, and they operate four valves per cylinder. 

  <b>Suspension:</b> M Coupes, like the M Roadsters, have front mounted engines, sending drive to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual Transmission. No automatic is available for the M coupe. Its suspension uses front struts and semi trailing arms. With greater torsional stiffness and less weight than the roadster, the M Coupe has slightly different spring and shock rates to compensate.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

   First impressions with the <b>interior</b> of the M Coupe is that it is very small. There is enough room although for 2 average sized adults (this is a 2 seater by the way). The steering wheel is thick and feels like glue when it's in your hands. There is a tachometer and many cockpit like gauges near the excellent sounding CD player stereo system. The seats are 'super supportive' which offer excellent bolstering for aggressive driving. The cabin's ergonomics are first class and allow for the driver to keep his or her eyes on the road at all times, this is essential for a car that is made to drive hard and fast.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>
  

The <b>exterior,</b> while some may love it, this is not my favorite looking automobile. It is one of the most original coupes I have driven, but that is not going to give this car any brownie points in the looks department. The M Coupe comes with 5 spoke, 17" alloy rims, flared wheel arches, and side vents that were developed from the regular Z3 and the old 507. the M Coupes comes with very stylish headlamps, the tapered headlamp design is crucial in defining the Coupes front fascia.

<i>Price:</i>

  The <b>price</b> for these cars are pretty high, a 2000 model will set you back around $35,000. These cars new ran for as much as $42,000. There were not very many made so prices remain high.


<i>Conclusion:</i>


If you are looking for an upscale sports coupe on the used market, the M Coupe offers plenty of bang for your buck. While repairs may cost a bit more than your average American hatchback, the M Coupe offers exclusivity rights that the driver will enjoy as long as they own this vehicle.
