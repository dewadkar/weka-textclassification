            When it came time the replace my 2-year-old family sport utility I went to my local Ford dealership as I have many times before. After much dissatisfaction, my wife and I took some advice from a trusted friend and test-drove a BMW 525iT. I have been in the automotive business for some 15 years now so a BMW and I have crossed paths before.
 The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek looking road hungry appearance. After a short (but Fast) test-drive both the car and my wife knew I was in love. The vehicleï¿½s big six cylinder was extremely powerful yet quit as a mouse. The 5 series wagons suspension and fat rubber held the road as tight as any 2 door I have ever been in and the ride was as smooth as silk. Plus this baby stops like no other. As for room, being a larger size dude and two car seats in the back there is plenty. 
Some down sides to this vehicle are the automatic transmission. The shift points are set higher then I am use to so it seams like a long time before shifts. There is also a little more noise in the tranny then I would like to hear. Last major down side is, speeding tickets. This family rocket does not even start to let out its best performance until 80 miles an hour.
There is a huge line between a sports car and the family wagon but my 525iT has narrowed the gap.
Safety was a big concern but if you cant drive your way out with this nimble driver the anti-lock brakes, traction control ASC and dual air bags are there for you. 
It was a hard decision to purchase a used five year old Import when we set out to get a new Ford but after owning it for some time I do not know what I was waiting for.
