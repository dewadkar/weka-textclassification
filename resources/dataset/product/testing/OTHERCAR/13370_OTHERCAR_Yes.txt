            This vehicle is off the chain.  It is the best car that Acura has ever made.  I like it more that the R.L, the T.L or the integra.  It is the true definition of quality and sport all rolled into one.  It is very comfortable to ride in, it gives just the right amount of power when needed.  It's size is exactly what I needed for my family of 4.  The look of the car is also something that stands out amongst all other vehicles.  However, what I like most about the vehicle is it's price, affordable.  If I had one complaint it would be that I hate the fact that the company no longer makes these beautiful vehicles.<br><br>
