            After a long search and extensive test drives of the Volkswagon GTI, BMW 3 Series, Celica GTS, Mustang GT and Ford Focus, I settled on the Honda Civic 2 Door SI Coupe.  Although this is the first time I bought less car than I could afford, I find myself more and more pleased with my purchase with each passing day.

The car is a pure pleasure to drive.  Despite the engine's specs -- 160HP, 8000RPM redline -- it's not quite a sports car.  However, it is quite sporty when driven hard.  It's quick off the line, it corners like mad and the VTEC growl makes it sound like something out of formula 1 when you rev it past 5500 RPM.  The front seats are firm and make for a very good driving position.  They are also quite comfortable as I discovered on my drive from Houston to Dallas (roughly 4 hours).  Unlike some of the other cars I test drove, it can also behave like a very nice economy car when driven soft.

The car came well equipped with a power sunroof, AM/FM/CD with 6 speakers and AC.  It also has some nice appearance features like alloy wheels and VTEC decals.  Even so, I am often reminded that I am riding around in a sporty economy car.  The interior is a bit spartan.  At highway speeds the high-reving engine and other highway noises force me to turn up the stereo quite a bit.  Headroom is a bit cramped for a 6 footer like me.  Legroom in back is good for an economy car, but I wouldn't want to be stuck back there for more than an hour or so.

At around $18,000 I think this car is a great value.  It balances economy, features and performance better than anything else I thought about buying.  In stock form, it is a BLAST to drive.  Given Honda's reputation, it should be reliable and maintain good resale value.  Overall, knowing what I know now I would buy it again!<br><br>
