            I had the opportunity to check out the new PT Cruiser this past weekend, and I must say it is really a fun car with style.  Our friend is on the list to buy one and that I feel is the problem.  I don't like when you have to be on a list to get an item, what the manufacturer didn't think to make enough?  The PT Cruiser is a hot item, it looks cool and has all the fun stuff you would want in a car, but this waiting list nonsense makes me want to look for something else.  The car has style, it has plenty of features (I especially like the built in picnic basket) and it has the WOW factor that those of us over 40 enjoy, but waiting to get one is not my idea of a good selling point.  The last time a manufacturer did that to me was Mazda and the Miata.  I didn't buy a Miata for that reason and I am sure I won't get a PT Cruiser for the same reason.  I know it could just be me, but there are other cars out there and I don't think any car is worth the hype.  Our friend by the way may have to wait 6 months or more to get his, the one he brought by for us to see was from a car rental dealer.  He wanted to test drive one and the car dealer didn't even have one on the lot, so he had to rent one.  Now talk about hype.  PT Cruiser is sure to turn heads, and in the near future they will be as common as the new VW bugs, but for now the cry goes out...&quot;where are you?&quot;.  I guess if you just have to have one it will be worth the wait, for me, well I may just find a Toyota Echo in the meantime.<br><br>
