            I recently had the oppurtunity to rent a '99 Toyota Corolla. I enjoyed the ease of handling which included very good throttle response, adequate passing ability, and nice brakes.

The interior was comfortable and part of my enjoyment of the car was because of the great organization. All the controls were clearly marked and were easy to use. This car had a spacious glove compartment, a small storage compartment on the dash to the left of the steering wheel, which was big enough to hold pens, reciepts, or a candy bar. There as a decent cupholder which could actually hold 2 cups of any size without spilling. There was ample space to store a few tapes.

All these features made it easy to keep the car neat and mess free. However, my '95 Ford Escort LX has a number of features the Toyota did without, such as: power windows and locks, rear window defroster, attached gas cap, cruise control, and a trip odometer. I really missed not having these in the Corolla. I enjoyed having a trunk rather than a hatch thanks to the lower liftover height.

It was nice to try a different car [I might be tempted to buy one] but I will stick with the Escort for now. This is a nice family car that is well put together. It is designed to get you comfortably from point A to point B with no questions asked, not for pampering you with leather seats and the latest gizmos or blowing away the Trans Am in the next lane.
