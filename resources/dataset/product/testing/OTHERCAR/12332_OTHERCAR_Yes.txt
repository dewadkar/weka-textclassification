            The 2000 Eclipse is completely redesigned and definitely made for the Millenium.

I recently purchased a black 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS. The price was $19,542. After taxes it came around 21k. I do not regret paying that much for such a lovely car.

Why do I love the 2000 Eclipse so much? Well first of all, it's got a sleek, futuristic look to it. Mitsubishi calls it &quot;geo-mechanical.&quot; Shifting gears on the manual transmission is so easy, my dog could probably do it for me.

Mitsubishi took out the turbo charge and the 210hp versions and replaced them with 4-cylinder (155hp) and 6-cylinder (205hp) versions. No more sitting at the light twiddling your thumbs while inhaling fumes from passing cars (the turbo had to be charged up). Though many people may miss the &quot;power&quot; of the older versions.

One problem will probably always remain. It's been one of the reasons so many consumers stayed away from the Eclipse. From the birth of the Eclipse (1989) to present, leg space in the back seats were never enough. You might as well take the back seats out and use them as cargo space. If you can fit back there, you've got to be some kind of magician. I dislike the color of the interior. Beige seats do not fit to kindly with a sporty coupe. The black interface is pretty nice but looks and feels cheap (sort of like plastic).

In conclusion, the 2000 Eclipse is not only a great car that comes with a great price, it is the beginning of a new era of sporty coupes. Mitsubishi finally opened its eyes.<br><br>
