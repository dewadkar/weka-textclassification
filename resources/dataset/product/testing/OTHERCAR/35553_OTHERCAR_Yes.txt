            This digital camera is not for everybody.  If you're looking for a professional rig, great "available light" pictures, or a camera to take all the shots from your week long vacation- this is not for you.  

However, if you're looking for small, rugged, lightweight, camera for quick trips to the park or the zoo to send to grandma's email- then this cam deserves a second look.

The cam can be powered by either two AAA batteries in stand-alone mode or by plugging into your computer's USB port (which is how it connects to your computer).  In stand-alone mode it can hold up to 26 images in high res or 196 images in low res.  (You can find all the technical data on the camera by visiting aiptek.com)  High res pictures are acceptable but the low-res shot would only be suitable for small index shots.  In stand-alone mode you can also take short videos (without sound) with the "continuous exposure" function (number of frames limited by the maximum number of images the camera can hold in either high or low res).  Based on the storage of the camera this comes across as more of a gimmick than an actual useful function.  However- sometimes when the camera will not take a picture because of low lighting it is possible to "force" the camera to take a shot by taking only one frame of the continuous exposure.  When hooked up to your computer via USB you can still take single exposure or continuous exposure shots as well as use the camera with the included stand as a "web cam" for video conferencing.  You can also record video in this mode but without the limits of the camera's storage.  

The camera is very lightweight and sturdy.  It's roughly the size of a candy bar and fits in a shirt pocket easily.  When outside it takes its best pictures on overcast days or in the shade as a bright sun may wash the colors out of some pictures.  When used inside it's best to have as much light as possible.

The camera is very easy to use and only has two buttons to operate.  Battery usage is fantastic!  Digital cameras are well known for their ability to eat batteries but this little guy will work off of two AAA's for two or more weeks under average use.  The USB connection makes getting the pictures to your computer a snap.  USB not only allows the cam to download the pictures but also provides power as well which also cuts down on battery use.

In short, there are better cameras on the market- if you're willing to pay the money for them.  This little cam meets the needs of our family and is a great compliment to a film camera.  If you find yourself buying multiple one-time use disposable film cameras I would highly recommend you picking up this little cam.  We paid around $60 for it at a major retailer and along with the software that comes with it, I would consider that a very fair price for what you get.

And it looks like something James Bond would use...
