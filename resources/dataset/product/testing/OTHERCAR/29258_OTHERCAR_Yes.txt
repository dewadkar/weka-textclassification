            I have had my Chevrolet Blazer for a couple of years now and love it.  I would never go back to a regular car.   It is a 1995 Maroon 4 door/4 wheel drive, and options which includes cruise control.   This is great for highway driving which I do to and from work every day.  Another great thing about it is that it has a pushbutton to change it to 4 wheel drive even in motion which is excellent in the snow. I hate driving in snow.  The mileage is good, not sure about the mileage.

Another, ok minor thing I really like is it that it is so high as opposed to a normal car and I don't feel intimitated by the trailer trucks. etc.  I realize this seem minor, but I really get intimated and afraid when trailer trucks tail gate which is often on the highway.  Sorry if I offend anyone, but that is how I feel.
