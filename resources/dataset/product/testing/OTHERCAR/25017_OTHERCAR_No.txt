            We bought this minivan new in June 1995 when a car accident totaled our beloved, less-than-six-months-old Chevy Blazer. As the proud owners of a 1994 Chevy Astro, we knew that we would be trading some durability and utility for comfort and improved gas mileage with a car-based minivan. What we weren't prepared for was how much durability we would really give up.

For about the first 50,000 miles it functioned perfectly with the exception of a set of broken tie rods and shot leaf springs (a very inexpensive replacement). It was comfortable on long trips and had plenty of power -- even though the 3 liter Mitsubishi V6 didn't look like it could cut much mustard on paper with 142 horsepower (especially compared to our Astro with 200 hp or the Blazer with 190 hp), it could still manage to accelerate from zero to sixty in under ten seconds, while maintaining 23-25 mpg, a far cry from the Astro (16 mpg) and the Blazer (17 mpg).

However, once the odometer turned 60,000, the van literally fell apart at the seams. The power rear quarter vent windows had ceased to operate, as well as the driver's window. The power door locks were also shot. The air conditioning compressor and belt both failed in the middle of summer, and cost nearly $1400 to replace.

At about 100,000 miles, I almost became a statistic when I pulled out into an intersection to make a left turn. When I finally got a gap in traffic, I pushed on the throttle. I almost had a heart attack when I realized that the car was dead. I tried to start it, to no avail. At this point, I was in the middle of an intersection and had a red light. There was a semi coming down the road, on a direct collision course with me, going fast enough that he probably wouldn't be able to stop. On the third try, the car finally started (as did my heart) and I was able to avoid an accident, but it was like the damage was already done. I pulled into a parking lot and called for a tow. I was the proud owner of a faulty fuel pump. Cost to replace? $300. 

Now, at only 120,000 miles, the transmission is in need of a complete rebuild (harsh shifts are the norm, and the torque converter clutch is on its way out), the engine is losing compression like Carnie Wilson is losing weight, and I'm losing fuel economy and power at an equally alarming rate (I just made a 200 mile round trip in one day on flat, 65 mph highway at an average mpg of 19.5, according to the nifty onboard computer -- just one year ago I would probably average about 23-24 in the same trip). I've tried all the quick fixes, I've gotten a tune-up, changed the transmission fluid and re-trained the computer about a dozen times, all for nothing.

In contrast, my 1994 Astro has over 160,000 miles, but the engine is still functioning as new, the mechanicals are in perfect condition and with the exception of periodic maintenance is still in near perfect shape.

It is truly a shame because when this van functioned as advertised it was a perfect vehicle. Admittedly it wasn't constructed of the highest quality materials but I was willing to overlook that in light of the good value it offered for my family (over $6000 less than the Blazer it replaced, with a comparable quality level and more-or-less comparable equipment level) and the interior has certainly taken the abuse my family has dished out in stride...with the exception of one broken coat hook in the headliner, some scuff marks on the plastic in the cargo hold and worn floormats up front, the interior is in perfect condition. 

Nevertheless -- it has shaken my confidence in Chrysler and my faith in their products. I wonder if all those automotive publications that called Chrysler the king of the minivan market back in '95 knew just what kind of product they were really putting out. Needless to say, I will be dumping this piece of crap at the first chance I get, and moving on to something (anything) else.

UPDATE - 9/2002 - My transmission went to auto-parts heaven (or hell, in Chrysler's case) a week ago at 129,200 miles. I had the sh*tbox towed to a dealer in the next city and then to an independent repair shop to get two estimates, dealer said $2,000, while independent mechanic said $1,500. Either way, it's not worth it. I called DaimlerChrysler's zone office to complain about this piece of garbage, looking for maybe some partial assistance, and the only thing I got was "I'm sorry, but if you were looking for reliability, you should have bought a Honda, because Chryslers are not known for their reliability. We will not help you with your repair costs." In any event, I hope that the money that DaimlerChrysler made off of me back in 1995 will last them a good while, because they are CERTAINLY not getting any more of it. Watch for more updates as I consider suing Chrysler in small claims court.

UPDATE - 12/2002 - I just turned the Voyager in as a trade on a preowned 2001 Chevrolet Astro. After putting in a used transmission with 75,000 miles in for about $500, I received a trade-in allowance of $1,500 for the piece of crap, which was an offer that I couldn't afford to refuse. I am infinitely happy to be rid of the vehicle and am looking forward to many hundreds of thousands of miles with my new Astro. May the Voyager find a happy home with someone who has more patience with incompetent vehicles than I do. In a strange way, though, I do miss the car - I almost feel sorry for it, because even though it almost got my children and I killed on more than one occasion, I don't think that its the car's fault, rather, it's the manufacturer's fault. I hope that DaimlerChrysler learns from cases like mine that using parts of poor quality only ruins their reputations, especially when these unreliable pieces of equipment are billed as safe transportation devices for families.
