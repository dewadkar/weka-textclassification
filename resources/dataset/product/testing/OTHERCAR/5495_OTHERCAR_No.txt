            This was my first car.  I had my liscence for about three months when I saw it, I fell in love.  It was a little cutie with glossy blue paint.  And that's all i needed, I didn't even want to drive it.  But i did.  It drove excellent.  So, i took it home and it wasn't long after that that every little thing went wrong.  About three months after I got it, it wasn't shifting right...it was sluggish and up hill?  Forget it.  

So I took it in to get checked out.  The guy tells me I need a new head gasket in addition to the 267 dollars worth of work he just did.  I couldn't afford that.  But I guess Cavaliers are prone to blown head gaskets because the engines are small and aren't meant to go the speeds they are pushed to.  The mechanic tells me to put this stuff in that is supposed to seal it up.  It worked for the time being.  

This poor puppy was in and out of the shop so many times.  And then, when I had a buyer lined up and a new(used, but new to me) car waiting for me the transmission went...and i was stranded!  As if it wasn't bad enough my car wouldn't MOVE...I got ISS for cutting class.  Eventhough i only went home to grab a book, i ran in and when i came out and started my car and threw it in reverse, I just rolled back.  Okay fine, this leaves me with out a car for like 3 months while my dad fixed it.  

Don't get me wrong I loved my car.  But it did me wrong so many times.  My father put the transmission from another chevy cavalier into it, and I expected it to be fine.  BUT IT WASN'T.  About a month or so later, it decides it doesn't want to shift or go up hill.  I figured it needed a tune up, but that wasn't the problem.  So, now two transmissions later...I am converted from american cars for a few reasons.  THEY DIE so much sooner than foreign cars, and the gas mileage stinks.  And now i'm looking into a Honda CRX.  Where ever my car adventure takes me, it will never bring me back to a cavalier.<br><br>
