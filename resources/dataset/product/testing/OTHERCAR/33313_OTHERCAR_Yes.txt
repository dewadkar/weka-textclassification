            I bought this vehicle because it offered everything that I wanted in a vehicle.  Prior to purchasing my Forester, I drove a 1991 Chevy S-10 Blazer.  I enjoyed my Blazer, but there were several aspects that I didn't like.  Road noise, gas mileage, and handling detracted my driving experience.  

When I bought my Forester, I did some pretty deep research about them.  The more I read, the more I liked them.  Finally, it was time to go to the dealership for a test drive.  I was hooked!  Road noise was quieter, gas mileage was better, and the handling was more like a car than a SUV.

I live in the Upper Midwest and have drove my Forester through several ice/snow storms.  Never have I felt that I had such an advantage over the other drivers on the road.

Obviously, the Forester would not work for someone who would like to do some heavy towing.  If you are looking for mechanically superior car that is fun to drive, then the Forester is the car for you!<br><br>
