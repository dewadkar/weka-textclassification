            I have had a few Range Rover 4.0 and 4.6
They are solid tough cars with very old fashioned
and quirky designs. They are still very British in
their driving and in the interior controls. All of
the window switches are backwards and there are always
strange bells and whistles to tell you of all sort of
unimportant things. They are great cars for poor driving
conditions and given their weight probably very safe to
drive or crash
There are a few areas that are my biggest complaints
#1 they are very underpowered
#2 They are expensive to maintain
#3 They have poor resale value
#4 Too expensive to purchase
