            This car is a MUST for all types of people.  I'm a valet, and i own a 2000 Nissan Maxima SE, i have done things you won't believe.  Some may say &quot;What can a valet do?&quot; well i have tested every aspects of it before purchasing it.  I have tested cornering at 40-50, and braking at 65, and both were way above satisfactory.  The car is very responsive, and has a very comfortable ride.  The 222hp engine has enough power to pull 5 people without any lag or lose of power.  

PROS:
1)7 speaker BOSE stereo-Its loud, clear, and delivers just enough bass without having speakers rattling.
2)222hp-Has enough power to make you sink into your seat. at acceleration.
3)Interior-Excellent leather, spacious design, everything is within reach.
4)Exterior-Sleek
5)Handling-Corners excellent at 40-45, into a street corner, traction control really help.
6)A really new design, with eliminates a lot of extra parts to save you money in the long run EX: no spark plug wires needed (direct connection), a steel chain for the timing belt (a lot better then the old fashion rubber belt, which can snap over a long period of time.
CONS:
1)Manuel Transmission ONLY-If you redline, and pop it into first gear, the whole dash jerks, and shakes, due to vibrations from the wheels.  The suspension is fair.
2)A front strut bar may be need to keep the body from shifting much. at hard cornering.
3)I spent about $10 of gas in 3 days. Not really a car for you if you want the economy type car.

Basically i have tested it and beat on the car, from hard corning to fish tails with the back wheels locked up to peel outs. The car handles great
