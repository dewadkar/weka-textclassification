            I bought my 99 Tacoma 4X4 about 3 months ago and it is not everything it is said to be. First of all the myth that Toyota keeps it value Yeah right! I have checked on it and currently is only worth about 17,000 versus the 24,ooo sticker price..It lost that much value within the same year what is up with that?? Previous to owning this truck i had a 98 Isuzu Hombre which i will have to say for $9,999 it was a hell of a truck and worth every penny of it. It had more standard features than this truck from the 4 wheel antilock brakes to the daytime running lights and automatic headlights. I am just very disappointed in this truck for the money I definately made a mistake in getting this one. Also the road noise on the 2.7 liter 4 cyl is pretty loud versus the Isuzu.Well thats it for me I will keep you all informed.<br><br>
