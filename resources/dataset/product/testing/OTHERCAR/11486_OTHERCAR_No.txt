            When I started in college my father bought me a brand new 1995 Saturn SL 1.  I thought they were cute cars, the price was good, and I wouldn't have any problems...I couldn't have been more wrong.  This car had a whopping 40 miles on it when I bought it and was plagued with problems from the day I drove it off the lot.  Let me just list for you the problems I encountered...granted all were covered under my warranty, but if you bought the car today...you probably won't be that lucky...
1.  Odometer was clicking at 12,000 miles - replaced
2.  Front Door locks stopped working - replaced
3.  Front Bumper began to fall off - replaced
4.  Misc. Small problems - all fixed

All the above were minor compared to having the transmission fixed 3 times before 32,000 miles.  I want to point out that I had an automatic transmission on this car.

The first time it went out was on a cross country trip to California and it went out in Colorado.  I had about 15,000 miles on the car.  We had a hard time shifting from park to reverse or drive. We brought the car into the shop and they fixed the transmission.  It worked great for about 10,000 miles, then the same thing happened.  I took it in they fixed it.  I called the regional manager and chewed him out over the telephone regarding all the problems I had with my vehicle.  He didn't want to listen to any of them...after about 30 minutes on the phone he finally agreed to pay to fix my transmission again if I had problems even if my warranty was expired,  At 31,000 miles my transmission went out again.  Fortunatly Saturn held up their end of the bargain and fixed it for free...but when I got it out of the shop it began dying at every stop light.  I took it back the same day and had them check it.  They told me it was some mechanical problem and it was going to run me $400 to fix it.  I argued that it didn't have the problem when I took it in...they stated that "these things can just go out at any time."  Funny how it went out right after they had to fix my transmission for free.  I picked up my car and took it to a seperate mechanic.  He informed me that my only problem was a loose spark plug.  He tightned it and my car ran great.  After this hassle we decided to get rid of the car as soon as possible.  I wish I had known about lemon laws back then because I think my car would have qualified.  I would recommend steering clear of this vehicle.  I'm not the only one who has had transmission problems.  If you do decide to purchase one try to get a good extended warranty.  Good Luck!
