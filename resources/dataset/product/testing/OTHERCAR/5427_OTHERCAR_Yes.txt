            The Chrysler 300M was selected in 1999 and 2000 as one of Car and Driver's 10 Best cars from around the world.  It is luxurious and quite powerful.  The 300M boasts a SOHC 24-valve 3.5-liter High-Output V6 that gets 100,000 miles between tune-ups.  It produces 250 horsepower at 6,400 rpm.  Below are a list of some of the standard features:
* Low-Speed Traction Control
* Fully independent suspension
* Quad-halogen headlamps
* Electronic speed control
* Preset seat/ radio/ exterior mirror memory for two drivers
* Height-adjustable steering column
* CFC-free air conditioning with automatic temperature control
* User-ready child seat top tether anchors
* Vehicle Security System
* Heated, eight-way power front seats
* Leather trim
* 16.8 cubic feet cargo area
* 60/40 split folding rear seat
* Trunk cargo net

The 300M has a overhead console that has dual map lights, compass, outside temperature, and an available driver-programmable Electronic Vehicle Information Center (EVIC), and Homelink Universal Transceiver.  The audio controls are steering wheel-mounted and you have the option of the Infinity II Spatial Imaging Sound System that has 360 watts of power and a four-disc in-dash CD changer.

If you can afford the Chrysler 300M, you will be getting one of the best cars in the world today.  Also, one of the safest with the four-wheel disc brakes and antilock brake system.  Plus, the tighter suspension tweaks in the available Performance Handling Group Package boost the 300M's cornering power to the max.  

Go to your nearest Chrysler dealer and ask to take a 300M for a drive and feel the luxury.<br><br>
