            I'm very happy with my PowerShot G2.  I've had it just over a week and found it to take wonderful pictures.  I print them on my Epson Stylus Photo 890 on glossy photo paper and the results are stunning.  

The camera feels very solid in my hand.  It is comfortable to grasp and the crucial controls are placed sensibly.

The LCD is bright and very crisp.  It blows away the LCD on my 2-year old Kodak DC280.  The swiveling LCD viewer makes it much easier to view images without tilting the camera all over the place.  

The included remote control is a neat feature but I feel that it is too lethargic.  It is almost like piloting the camera on the moon as each time you make a change via the remote it seems to take the camera a second or two to perform the change.

The included software has a neat photo stitching package which amazes me in how well it puts pictures together.  I really can't tell that it stitched multiple photos together- it is that good.

Loading pictures and movies off of the camera is straightforward.  You plug in the camera (via included USB cable) and launch their "ZoomBrowser" helper software.  

Shooting movies is very easy and they actually turn out pretty good on the computer.  I wish you could plug in an external microphone though for better audio.

I like that it supports type2 compact flash so that I can add a microdrive later.  The included 32MB type 1 compact flash is nice but not nearly enough.  I bought a 256 MB compact flash and that lets me hold 123 pictures at the highest setting and even 83 pictures in raw mode at the highest resolution- very nice!

3x optical zoom is a welcome feature.

I'm looking forward to buying an attachable flash for even more flexibility in the future.
