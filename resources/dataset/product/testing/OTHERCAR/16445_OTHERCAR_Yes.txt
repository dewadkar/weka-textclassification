            I purchased this camera not only to share images on the web, but to be able to print photos rather than pay the high developing price.  I have been pretty satisfied overall with the camera and the picture quality.  The battery life on the camera is pretty low however, so when purchasing, splurge for the adapter.  If the adapter is used when uploading to the computer, or taking pictures around the house, you will save a lot on battery use.  Also, I recommend getting some rechargeable NiMh batteries, along with a charger.  (The NiMh have a longer life than the Nicd) A charger can be purchased at your local Walmart or Target, or online for approx. $10. This camera takes 4 AA nimh or nicd batteries, so you are set when you buy 8 of these rechargeable batteries, so you always have back-up.  Another con is the memory card it comes with.  It is quite small, so you will need to purchase a higher, or just another card shortly, unless you only plan on taking a few pics, and uploading immediately.  For the price of the camera, then all the extras, it could end up running you a pretty penny, although it seems that way with everything in this digital age. After taking pics, the construction of them is quite slow, however unless you need something to take quick pics, this camera works fine.
