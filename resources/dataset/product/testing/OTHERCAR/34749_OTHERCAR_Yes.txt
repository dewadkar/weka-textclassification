                The Successor of the boxy third generation Celica, the original Supra was aimed at the U.S market. It boasted a 2.8 liter straight-six cylinder engine that produced 160 horsepower. Handling is not all that great for this year, but it soon was perfected. Its last year in production, 1997, the Supra was one of the fastest production cars on the market, and one of the most exclusive! 

<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

    The sporty Celica Supra is comfortable and refined. Its 2.8 liter engine is smooth all the way to reline and has enough torque for this car to move its girth without much fuss. Despite the car's weight it can achieve a reported top speed of 128 MPH (according to specs), and 0-60 in less than 9 seconds (according to specs). In 1984 this sort of performance was amazing for a 6-cylinder powered car, and matched many cars that were equipped with much larger V8s. 
When flying through a fast corner the Supra feels well mannered, with not too much body roll/lean. If provoked the tail will slip out, but it is easily controlled. The wide 225/60 VR 14 tires help grip.

  Unlike many 6-cylinder engines of the early 80s, the Celica Supra's fuel injected unit provides large amounts of torque, especially for this year of car. With a relatively high torque peak of 163 lb-ft at 4,400 RPM, the engine still remains flexible, allowing the car to pull well in high gears as well as low. The 160 horse powered 2.8 liter engine has a cast iron block, and has two valves per cylinder and twin overhead camshafts driven off a toothed belt. It has breakerless ignition with a nippondenso electronic fuel injection system feeding fuel to each of the cylinders. Standard 1/4th mile times are around 16.5 seconds, hardly breathtaking for 2002 standards, but that was excellent in
1984 and could compete with cars like the V8 powered Chevrolet Corvette. 

  The silky smooth, inline-Six cylinder engine is mounted longitudinally, driving the rear wheels through a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, with a limited slip differential added to the final drive. Lotus engineers increased resistance in the suspension mountings that regrettably resulted in more road noise. Albeit transformed road-holding. Large vented disc brakes are used at the front and rear for very effective <b>braking</b>.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

  The <b>interior</b> of the 1984 Celica Supra is mostly of  black plastic. This black plastic is typical of almost all Japanese cars of the 1980s to early 1990s.  The steering wheel is thick, and ergonomics are excellent. Amenities are one of the Supra's Forte's for this year. AC, Cruise control, etc are all standard. This car even comes standard with a sunroof! The Supra's angular interior shape, and digital instruments are typical for the mid 80s. There is plenty of room in the 1984 Toyota Supra. The 2 2 configuration, unlike many other cars actually could accommodate 2 backseat passengers without compromise. There is surprisingly plenty of trunk room as well. The drivers seat is comfortable and supportive, which also provides excellent outward vision.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

   The <b>exterior</b>, while not a contender in the 2002 Miss America pageant, is quite good looking, especially for a 1984 vehicle. The exterior is your typical 1980s hatchback 2 door design. There are pop-up headlights, four spoke aluminum rims, flared wheel arches, and non functional brake ducts that  give the 1984 Supra a very sporty look.

   The <b>price</b> for these cars are 'super cheap' today. My brother got his in 1999 with 156K miles on it for $500.00 dollars. Talk about a good deal! New, these cars ran for around $16,000. He now has something like 220K miles on it and it's still running strong.

<i>Conclusion:</i>

The 1984 Toyota Celica Supra offers amazing bang for the consumer's bucks. If you are looking for a cheap performance car on the used market but don't want to settle for slow rustbucket, the 1984 Celica Supra is definitely worth a look.
