            Well, I had an old 1989 Ford Taurus that was pretty much on it's last legs. I went to the Kia Dealership because they had a big sign that said &quot;Kia Sephia's $8500!&quot;. I went in there to check out their cars and I absolutely fell in LOVE with this cute little 2001 Sunburst Gold Kia Rio. I got it for $10,000 with the upgrade package, which includes drivers side visor vanity mirror, body color side mouldings, passenger side airbag, and various other things.

You should see the looks people give when they see this car on the road. Sunburst Yellow is the coolest color, and not everyone has it!

The interior is very roomy, and it's a complete joy to drive. The only problem I have had with it so far, at 3000 miles, is the airbag light going on and off but that will be fixed this weekend along with a free oil change I got for filling out a survey about the dealership's performance in selling me the car. (Which, by the way, was EXCELLENT).

Also, I think the speaker system is kinda lame, and there are no controls for bass/treble. I only have the stereo/cassette option, they didn't have any Sunburst Yellow ones at the dealership that had a CD Player. I'm going to get a new stereo system installed sometime in the future.

You can also order parts/accessories online at www.kia.com. Things like a rear spoiler, carpeted floor mats, and such.

And one of the best things about it is Kia's Long Haul Warranty Program: 
*Limited Powertrain 10 years or 100,000 miles 
*Limited Basic 5 years or 60,000 miles 
*Limited Anti-Perforation 5 years or 100,000 miles 
*Roadside Assistance 5 years/unlimited miles 
(Applicable on all 2001 models and 2000 models sold after July 9, 2000). 

In a couple of weeks I'm about to take it out on a 1600 mile or so road trip, so I'll come back and tell you how it went. Stay Tuned!!<br><br>
