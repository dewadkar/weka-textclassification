            The Olympus C50 is my first digital camera.  That being said, this review will be very basic and geared for those people who will use it for traveling, family pics, etc.  I researched the internet for several months before deciding on the Olympus.  Despite it&#146s higher price in comparison to other brands, I do not regret the decision one bit.

EASE OF USE

In a word, simple.  After charging the battery overnight, I was up and running the next day at Mount Rushmore by simply reading the enclosed Quick start up guide.  The buttons on the camera itself are conveniently located.  My fingers are fairly small but a park ranger with much bigger hands used the camera without incident. The mode dial has small pictures on it to make it obvious which shooting mode you&#146re using.  I&#146ve kept mine in auto thus far and made out fine.  The monitor provides adequate indications for shooting such as battery life, number of storable pictures, flash setting, and target mark.  Navigation through menus is accomplished with arrow keys and an &#147OK&#148 button.  Frames can either be individually erased or all frames can be erased entirely.  There&#146s also a protect feature to prevent pictures from being erased accidentally.

THE MONITOR

The monitor is a 1.5&#148 color LCD display; approximately 134,000 pixels.  While small and not for the visually challenged, the clarity is superb.  It also works well in all types of light.  Another advantage is that you don&#146t have to open the lens barrier in order to view the pictures you&#146ve taken on the monitor.  Hitting the quick view button and navigating with the arrow keys is all you need to do in order to review your photos.  Unfortunately the LCD screen is just swinging in the breeze.  I bought some screen protectors to prevent scratching or damage to the surface.

DIMENSIONS

The compactness of the camera is one of the things that most attracted me to this camera.

Width: 3.9&#148   Height: 2.3&#148  Depth: 1.6&#148
Weight: 6.84 oz without the battery and picture card

STORAGE

The C50 uses the newest storage form Olympus xD picture card.  A 32 MB card is included which holds roughly 26 pictures in HQ mode.  Since xD picture card is fairly new, there isn&#146t much out on the market yet to support it.  I was in Best Buy today and they have the cards for sale and that&#146s about it.  The advantage of the card is its size, which makes the C50 itself small as a result.  

PICTURE QUALITY / SOFTWARE / BATTERY

I&#146ve yet to have any of my photos printed out so I can&#146t offer an opinion on that just yet.  I have, however, downloaded photos from the camera and emailed them out.  The picture quality is outstanding.  Tremendous detail.  I&#146m very pleased with the clarity and brightness of the photos.  The camera basically captures real life.  As for the software, Camedia Master, I didn&#146t see any specific instructions for it in my box so I just winged it (or should I say wung it?).  The Quick start guide walks you through the installation that is pretty standard CD-rom fare.  The camera requires a USB port to connect to your computer.  A USB cable is included.  The program lets you group individual photos into albums, edit the photos (resize, rotate, crop, red eye reduction, monochrome, etc.), and even create calendars or desktop wallpaper.  I haven&#146t quite figured out yet how to prevent my pictures from default saving to my C drive.  When hooking up to the computer, I&#146d recommend purchasing the optional AC adapter so your lithium-ion battery doesn&#146t run low if you&#146re hooked up to the computer for an extended amount of time.  Battery life is also excellent.  I&#146ve only charged it once a few weeks ago and have taken 26 pictures, downloaded them to the computer, deleted pics, and there&#146s still plenty of battery strength left.  The drawback is that you can&#146t charge the battery while it&#146s in the camera.  It must be in its dedicated charger.

PRICE

This may be the largest negative for the product.  It retails for $599.  I got mine off of eBay for $511 plus 29.99 for shipping and handling.  The company that I bought it from in addition to a factory sealed C50 also threw in a cleaning kit, a cheapy camera case, and an extra 64 MB card.
