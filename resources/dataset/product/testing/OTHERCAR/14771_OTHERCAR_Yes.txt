            If you're like me, you're looking for a decent used SUV and a) you don't understand terms like "torque" or "wheel base;" b) you really want to know how an older model performs NOW; and c) you like luxury features. Let me tell you about my 1997 Mercury Mountaineer :)

When I went looking for an SUV, I needed to keep the price under $13,000. In my area, SUVs are very popular cars, and the good ones are snapped up fast. I was looking for a Pathfinder or an Explorer, but the only ones I could find in my price range had very high miles and just <i>looked</i> old. As I was leaving my favorite dealership, the salesman asked me to try the Mountaineer. I was reluctanct, since it was blue (hate blue :) and since I'd never heard of this model, but he had spent so much time with me that I felt it was the kind thing to do. So I drove it.

And bought it as soon as we returned from the test drive :)

My Mountaineer has 70,000 miles on it but it drives like a new car. You know those annoying squeaks and rattles most cars seem to get as they age? None on this one. This SUV "feels" newer than many later-model cars I've driven.The doors open and close crisply, the controls are sharp, and the shape is classic and streamlined. It doesn't <i>look</i> like a 5-year-old vehicle....nor does it drive like one.

Let's get into details. This baby is loaded! All the extras, including cruise, a 6-disc CD changer, extra electrical outlet (to charge a cell phone or whatever), outside temperature and directional gauge, dual airbags, anti-lock breaks, built-in tissue holder, tons of "compartments" (if you're like me, you keep everything in your car from breath mints to CDs to extra lipstick to notebooks and everything else under the sun), keyless/remote entry, rear temperature/audio controls, power door locks, seats, windows, sunroof, anti-glare rearview mirror, rear-window defroster and wiper, etc. The interior is very roomy and extremely comfortable - like lounging in your favorite recliner! For a large truck, everything is within easy reach of the driver's seat, there's plenty of leg room in both front and back, and there isn't much of a blind spot.

The running boards make it easy for a petite person like me to hop in and out, and the seats are covered in such a soft material that you don't run your stockings or snag your skirt on anything (guys can ignore this part, but it's a biggie for women :). There's tons of cargo space in the back, and the rear divided seat folds down together or separately if you have odd-shaped stuff to carry. It has a V-8 so it feels very powerful to drive, and in the frequent snow and ice storms we have in my region, it handles beautifully and feels very safe.

The only drawbacks I've found so far are the gas mileage (the V-8 engine is a gas hog, but realistically, if you buy an SUV, bad gas mileage is just a fact), and the suspension. When going over bumps or dips, it can sway quite a bit - not sure if that's just the nature of SUVs or if I need to have some adjustments made - will check with the dealer next time I have it serviced.

For the price, this SUV is a prize, and one I would highly recommend over other models in its class. They're hard to find - don't know if this is because folks tend to hold onto them (I would!) or if they just aren't as plentiful as Explorers or Paths. Enjoy! :)
