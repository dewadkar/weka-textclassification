            My Mavica is great. I first saw one when a neighbor demonstrated hers to me, and I thought I had to have one too.  I considered other models in the Mavica line, but the FD-83 had the features I was looking for, and the resolution.  Picture quality is excellent.  I use the standard mode, not the fine mode, which reduces the file sizes a bit, at the expense of some resolution--however, I compared samples at both settings and can detect no obvious differences, so I opt for smaller file sizes, allowing more pictures to be stored on a floppy.  At the highest resolution and largest picture size, you might get four pictures on a disk. At the standard resolution and mid-size picture setting, I can usually get eight photos.  You can check out samples of my photos at www.photopoint.com, and type in my e-mail address (dbgrizzz@aol.com).
Picture files load quickly, and are very easy to download into your computer via the A drive.  Copies of disks or pictures can be made with the camera to give to your friends.  You can view the pictures on any television with an RCA input jack.  It also allows for MPEG files--movies--up to a minute long.  It has a 3X optical zoom, which is more than adequate for me.  The digital zoom does blur things a bit, but it goes up to 6X if you really need it. Color rendition is fantastic.  There are a few cons, however--for example, sunlight washes out the LED display, so I bought a folding lens cover at a nominal expense.  All in all, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants to keep digital photography &quot;simple&quot;, yet get great results.<br><br>
