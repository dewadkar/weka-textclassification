            <b>The S200 is Canon's latest pocket sized camera entry.</b>  In fact, it's one of the smallest on the market from any company.  This Digital ELPH is the same size as the camera it replaced, the S110.  At 1.1" thin by 3.4" long x 2.2" high it really fits in your palm, and at 180g it weighs less than half a pound.  On paper, it doesn't look much smaller than the similar S330 or other compact cameras, but in person it sure feels much smaller.  The metal case and built-in lens cover make it easy to slip in a pocket, backpack or almost anywhere.

<b>As for use, I consider it average.</b>  It's extremely easy to use, but it isn't particularly fast.  It takes a few seconds to start, and seems to have a bit more shutter lag than some models.  So, if you're not ready it's easy to miss shots that you might have gotten with a film camera or a different digital camera.  The menus are decent, though not as easy to use or intuitive as recent Sony digital cameras.  Once you get used to the icons, it's pretty easy though.  The built-in focus assist lamp is a great feature many brands don't have.  The LCD is not large, but it can be seen even in bright sunlight.

<b>The manual and software are great.</b>  It's a breeze to download and preview your snapshots or movies on the computer.  The manual is detailed and clear.  2-megapixels is plenty to fill up the computer screen, or to print out good quality 5x7 photos from the included software.

<b>Small size apparently has some disadvantages.</b>  In my case, I find the photos to be rather soft.  In some lighting, they border on being slightly out-of-focus.  I've seen similar complaints on some online forums, and suspect it has to do with Canon's new firmware compression routines.  I've tried the various resolutions and compression settings, but the results are the same.  Great color, decent exposure, but details are always soft.  

In addition, the flash does not seem as powerful as similar cameras I've used, and the screen and photos tend to be a lot noisier in low light.  Battery life is fair, perhaps 75-100 photos with constant LCD use, and 100-200 without.  Unlike other brands which can also use rechargeable AA batteries, you are stuck with pricey proprietary batteries.  You'll definitely want one, and be sure to get the higher capacity NB-1LH, and not the older NB-1L which won't last as long.  Buy.com had the 1LH for under $40!  Fortunately, Canon's charger is included and is separate from the camera, so you can charge a second battery while using the camera.  You should also figure in the cost of a larger CompactFlash card; 64MB or larger.  The 2x zoom is sufficient, but not as nice as the 3x zoom in the slightly bigger and heavier S330.

The professional digital camera sites (Steves-Digicams.com, Imaging-resourse.com, Dcresource.com, etc) all gave this model high marks, so it's possible mine and some others maybe have a firmware issue.  I highly recommend those sites for the nitty-gritty details of this camera and its competition from digital photography experts.  I'd definitely recommend you make sure to get a good return policy in case you aren't happy with the photo quality.  Our older Sony DSC-P30 takes much sharper photos even with only 1.3 megapixels, and it is also much better in low light.  Too bad it doesn't fit in a pocket, and that the Sony DSC-P5 is bigger and pricier than the S200. Plus, the Sony and most other brands only give you 90 days on the labor warranty, Canon's is 1 year.

<b>Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of options for a camera this size.</b>  I did compare the S200 to the Dimage X.  Overall, I thought it was very close.  In the end, I returned the Dimage X in favor of the S200.  To be fair, I also returned the S200 for a replacement, in case the original one was defective.  I have not yet tested the new one, but I suspect it will be no different based on similar complaints I've seen on web forums regarding the focusing ability of the S200/S330.  Overall, the S200 is a nice camera, but not perfect by any means and very likely it has been overrated by various professional digicam sites based on my comparisons using real-life photos instead of still test subjects.

<B>Update:</B>

Since my original review, I have taken hundreds of photos on the replacement S200.  I still feel it suffers from somewhat soft images on many photos.  I also feel that the autofocus system 'misses' more than it should, even in good lighting conditions.  The camera has taken some superb images, but also a lot more duds than any camera at this price range should take.  Many other owners of the S200/S330 have reported similar issues in digital photography forums, and some have complained that the S220 does not perform as well as their S110 did.  I advise anyone looking at this camera to make sure you get a good return policy in case you find the similar problems.  It's a nice camera, but may not be as great as some other reviews might have you believe.
