             The feel that came over me when I test drove this new Double Cab Tacoma TRD was awesome!I felt in total control.The engine response was good. Perfect view. Great handling.The upgraded TRD suspension that I got was amazing.
 I went offroad with a friend that has an upgraded Chevy, and my stock Tacoma went up a few inclines that his full sized one was having quite a bit of difficulty overcoming!
 Toyota knows how to put an offroad pakage on a truck right the first time, no question. I love everything about my truck today, as the first day I drove it home. I have added some nice accessories to it as well, 3" Revtek lift kit, Chrome step-up rails, Bed liner, Bed extender, Dark tinted windows.... Sweet truck!
