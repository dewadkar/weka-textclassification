            The Z3 Roadster is a pure driving pleasure.  There aren't many cars that hug the road like this one!  You can corner at 40+ mph with no problem.  It's a fun little car and highly enjoyable.  If you're looking for a convertible, and don't mind driving only one friend at a time, then the Z3 is a great choice!  The body design is stylish, and the inside is surprisingly roomy!  You feel like you're in a luxury sedan...not a small roadster!

The manual top is easy to convert, but you'll need some muscle to get it started when putting it back up.  I wasn't too keen on the &quot;plastic&quot; rear window, but I haven't had any problems with it.  In fact, the field of vision through the rear-view mirror is great!

Everything in the car is automatic, including the heated seats!  Great for those chilly evenings when you want to go cruising with the top down!  I had keyless entry and LoJack installed for added security.  I also insisted that the Cassette Player be replaced with the CD changer in the cab.

I swore I would never buy a BMW, but after test-driving the Z3, I was hooked.  I plan to enjoy many years with this beautiful, fun to drive car!<br><br>
