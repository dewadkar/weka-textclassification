            I got my Saturn SL-1 at the end of my freshman year of college, in 1995. I loved, and still do love, this car, and am still driving it.  My affection for the car, though, has not made me lose sight of several saturn shortcomings.

    In the interest of ease of reading, I will first list the pros and then the cons of owning this car.

PROS:
   This car is amazingly easy to drive and gets great gas mileage.  I can fill up before leaving from Philadelphia for New york.  When I return from New york, I often have more than 3/4 of a tank left.  It is not fussy about what grade of gas you use, as long as its belly is full.
    The car handles well and is very responsive.  I've never felt a sensation of oversteer or understeer on the car, and the diminutive size really helps to maneuver the car in through places bigger cars can't dream of going. It is great for city parking, because many street spots are too short for a full-sized sedan, but fit the Saturn.
    I haven't had to replace anything on this car. I take it in for more-or-less routine maintenance, and the car hasn't given me a moment of trouble, mechanically speaking. My mechanic vouched for this trait as being common among the Saturns he services.  The acceleration and pickup are pretty good for a car of this size, but a good owner will quickly abandon dreams of drag racing this car.  It's just not up to the challenge.  Nevertheless, it chugs along just fine alongside Toyotas, Hondas, BMWs, etc. on the highway and in the city. I drove my car 25+ miles each way to work during the summer, and never noticed my car lacking the "oomph" to get up to and stay at highway speed.
   The standard stereo equipment is good, and gets good bass response. Unfortunately, it is often drowned out by road noise (see below).
    There is adequate seating for 5, if your back seat passengers are short and slim-hipped. It is probably only comfortable for 4 adults.  The trunk is relatively spacious, given the overall size of the car. Interior storage is sparse, but adequate.
   Also worthy of note- the Saturn dealers tend to be pleasant and courteous, due to the their "no haggle" policy. The price you see on the sticker is the price you pay.

CONS:
   First of all, my Saturn has leaked from the passenger side window since I got it.  Two days after I drove it home there was a torrential rain which soaked the passenger seat.  The dealer was apologetic, and relaced everything, but sure enough, when the next rain came, my windshield was still eaking from the passenger side.  Again, they fixed it, and it seemed to solve the problem.  I suppose time has worn away at the sealant they used, but recently my car has begun to leak again. If the day following the rain happens to be warm, the car develops a "humidor-like" feeling inside. If you are a cigar enthusiast maybe this is a good thing. I find it unpleasant.
   Have I mentioned how NOISY this little car is? Most smaller cars are noisy, if only because the engine is not that far from the passenger compartment.  However, in the Saturn you are only sitting about 4" above the ground, so you hear and feel every bump in the road.  The ride is not luxurious by any standards, unless, perhaps, you are upgrading from a bicycle.  The seats are firm to the point of being hard, and the car is quite uncomfortable for any distance over 30 miles. Nevertheless, the interior is well though out, and the controls and display panels are intelligently designed for ease of use and accessibility while driving.
   While there is nothing mechanically wrong with my brakes, the car does struggle on even slightly damp surfaces, and occasionally skids on dry surfaces, just because the brakes have been applied too hard.  that is probably more telling about my driving than about the car, but I prefer to drive someone else's car in heavy rains or in snow. The car simply does not have enough weight (or perhaps enough safety features) to stick to the road and get the kind of traction one needs in all-weather driving.  I will admit I am not easy on brakes, and they have saved me from quite a few costly collisions thus far.  Just be mindful of the tendency to skid and, if possible, test drive one when the roads are wet.


  I am pleased to have owned a Saturn and would recommend one to a friend looking for a car in that price range.  The Toyota Corolla might be a slightly more expensive and appealing choice, with that great Toyota reliability.  My complaints about this car are few, and it has performed at or above my expectations.  I will be trading it in shortly, but only because I am now able to buy a more expensive model.  But for that fact, I might keep this car until it falls apart- but I don't think it ever would.
