            I love my 89 Nissan Truck.  I am 20 years old and I purchased this truck when I was 15 and I have no intention of ever getting rid of it.  The truck only has 52,000 miles on it!!!!!! It has done it all for me, haul lawn equipment, tow, and on top of all that, win car shows!!!!!, this truck is slammed to the ground and still performs like a normal truck.  I even drive it in the snow and it never gets stuck.  Of my 5 years of ownership of this truck the only upkeep I have had is to replace my front brake pads, but that is just regular maintenence.  People think that Toyota is the top mini-truck, but I think that the Nissan Hardbody takes that title.  My friend's 85 Nissan 720 p/u now has 313,000 miles and is still running strong, these trucks are truly tough and will haul forever!!!<br><br>
