            I live in Colorado so I wanted a capable SUV and not a compromise soccer mom vehicle calling itself an SUV.  I use my 4Runner to climb mountains on unpaved trails for fun and it's also my daily commuter during rush hour traffic on the freeway.  Ground clearance is important to me as is true FWD (not AWD) with locking rear differential.  Most other so-called SUV's would bottom out on what I consider to be moderate trails and AWD transmissions don't come with a low gear for climbing boulders.

I have aggressive mud tires on my 4Runner so the ride isn't quiet but it's solid - there are no rattles or squeaks after 48K miles.  The V6 is just right without sucking nearly as much gas as those larger V8 SUV's.  It's smooth and picks up adequately.

Many of the other SUV's I looked at came with more goodies and &quot;bells and whistles&quot; than my 4Runner but there's no denying that Toyota's are rock solid and reliable.  I owned 2 older Camry's and a 1995 4Runner before buying my 1998 4Runner.  All of my Toyota's were absolutely reliable.  Change the oil, feed it gas, they run forever!  That was another big factor in my decision to buy yet another Toyota.
