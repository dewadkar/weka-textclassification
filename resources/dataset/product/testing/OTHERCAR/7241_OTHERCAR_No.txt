            I saw a commercial for the Cougar and loved it.  One test drive and I knew it would be mine.  Not only is it one of the best looking cars around, but it is fun to drive.  I have been extremely happy with the performance of my car both around town and on trips.  It has ample power to accelerate on a steep hill, pass, and merge into traffic.  It has handled icy roads with barely a slip or slide.

Unfortunately, the love for my car stops there.  It has about 22,000 miles and has been plagued with problems.  They range from minor problems such as squeaks and creaks to more serious problems of needing new motor mounts, a fly wheel, and power steering rack just to name a few.  In addition the breaks grind, but I am told that there is nothing wrong with them.  I would not recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
