            In my experiences with the Dodge Ram 2500 with a V-10 engine is that their must be some way to make it keep the power that is shows every time I go up a hill or tow something with it and still make it more economically advantageous from a standpoint of gas mileage.  It leaves other pickups comparably equipped behind with the great horsepower and torque that is available any time you need it.  After test driving the Ford F 250 with their V-10 in it; the decision to buy a Dodge Ram 2500 was easy from my perspective as a consumer.  With all of the technology available to these automotive mega-giants; you would think that they make even the biggest engines more economical to operate.<br><br>
