            I've had my 1998 Jeep Cherokee Sport for two years now and it is the best vehicle I have bought in the last 10 years.  I've only had it in the shop twice in 22K miles, once for a speed sensor that started acting up (at 5K) and once for a recall (at 12K). 

This Jeep is fairly quiet, roomy up front and drives smoothly.  The power is excellent with the in-line 4.0L 6-cylinder motor while gas mileage is fair; about 19 city, 24 highway.  The first 18K miles were driven in Nebraska where the winters can be harsh at times.  I never got stuck (even though it is a 2 wheel drive) and never got into any bad situations.  The Jeep was always sure footed and a breeze to handle.  

Another big plus is the cargo room.  I've hauled everything from plywood to book cases back there and haven't found anything that it couldn't swallow.  The rear seat cushion pulls out super fast for an extra flat cargo floor and weighs next to nothing.

If I could change a few things on it, the first would be the lack of door pockets.  These are only available in the top of the line models.  A dumb marketing move which causes the owner to have only a small glove box and center console bin for storage.  Also, the rear seat back doesn't split so hauling long loads requires dropping the entire seat back down.  Finally, rear seat room is kind of skimpy but since I don't haul anything larger than a 6-month old back there, it's not a problem.
