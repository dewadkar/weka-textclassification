            I bought this car about 3 and a half years ago as a used vehicle.  I bought it in a hurry, because my other car had died, it was Christmas Eve and I needed a car BAD.  I can't tell you how happy I am with this car.  I have only had two repairs to the car itself.  I bought it at ~ 31,000 miles and needed to have the front brakes and some other brake related item replaced at around 70,000 miles for a total cost of around $270.  At around 85,000 miles I needed to have the clutch replaced.  This set me back about $700.  Other than that it runs great.  I have about 91,000 miles on it now.

The only thing I don't like about it is the cup holder.  I know it seems petty, but the cupholder is above the tape player and this allows condensation from my drink to seep into the buttons of my tape player and cause the buttons to not function correctly or at all in some cases.

Other than that - the car is great.  I will probably buy another Subaru after this one.
