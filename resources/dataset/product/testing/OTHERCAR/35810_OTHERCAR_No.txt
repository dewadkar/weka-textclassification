                 I purchased a 1993 Saturn SL1 from a Saturn dealer last year (May of 1999).  The car was in good shape and appeared to be well maintained, also Saturn provided me with the service log on this car to prove that it had been maintained properly.  Normally I am suspicious when buying a used car, but I bought into the hype that Saturn was a different kind of car company, my mistake.  

     I bought the car because I wanted reliable transportation that would not require me to spend huge sums of money every few months to keep it on the road.  In the past year I have spent $600 and had the car in the shop 4 times. This last time they told me I needed to spend $800 to $2000 to repair the air conditioner, I can't afford it, so I no longer have the comfort of air conditioning.  The car is only 7 years old, I own a 1980 Datsun 200sx that still has a functioning air conditioner.

     I talked with the local Saturn dealership as well as the customer assistance center in Tennessee, bottom line was that they were unwilling to help or stand behind their product.  I found it funny that while they told me they wouldn't help, at the same time they kept telling me how wonderful their car company is and how they distinguish themselves from other car companies.

     I think Saturn is starting to believe their own rhetoric, their cars aren't any better, they just have better spin control and advertising. In my opinion they are like politicians, they promise you the world, but soon forget their promises after you buy the car.  The service department was good, however repairs were expensive and all to frequent.

     In summary I would not recommend purchasing a Saturn SL1, they are no better than any other car in the same price range. They are all hype and no substance. If you want a good reliable car, I would recommend looking at Nissan, Toyota, or Honda.<br><br>
