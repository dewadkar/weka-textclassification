            I bought my 1997 Accent in mid February of 2002-my trade in was a 1990 Ford Taurus. I knew that any car available to man would be better all-around than the Taurus, but I wasn't expecting my new Accent to have great gas mileage (32+ mpg), be so reliable and affordable, and have simple yet stylish interior and exterior. It fit me perfectly-it was small, but that is what a lot of first-time, simple drivers need...not a big clunker that takes 20 minutes to park. The engine was small (1.9 leader), so it wasn't a powerhouse, but it does slow one down when one feels like illegally speeding. My happiness with my new car ended when the driver of a 1995 Dodge Neon failed to yield and took a left-hand turn right in front of me. We collided. Both air bags came out with force, the seat belt latched, and before I knew it, I looked up and saw that my little car was completely totaled. Had the hood latches not been as strong as they were, the hood would have come through the windshield. Surprisingly, I came out with a few bruises and scrapes..despite the compact size of the Accent, the safety features had saved my life-or at least my brain. Because there are no Hyundai dealerships in my city, I am painfully unable to purchase another Accent, but if I had the opportunity, I would without a doubt buy another. What can I say??? That is a lot of car for very little money!!!
