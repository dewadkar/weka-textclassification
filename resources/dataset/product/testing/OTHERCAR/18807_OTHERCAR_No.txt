            I have no complaints at all about the Jeep Grand Cherokee but its sister the regular cherokee PLEASE SOMEONE HELP IT.  Allright if I had to sum the car up in one word it would be &quot;not worth the money&quot; ok so its not one word but still its how I view the SUV.  The engine,better than a Geo Metro, is not as powerfull in the hp area as might consumers want.  Also the enterior is well extrememly lacking with no room in the back seat and a extremely uncomfortable front seat wich makes you drive in a weird angle.  Also you would expect the quality of a Mopar vehicle would have been better I also thought it would be.  All together the car isnt quite upto par with the rest of Mopar automobiles and maybe it should be discontinued all together or at least have a little more time spent making the base model a little nicer. The Grand cherokee is one of the better SUV's on the market at the time.I wouldnt like to drive the base model on a regular basis or even for a rentall car but heh its my opinion so go test drive one and prove me wrong.<br><br>
