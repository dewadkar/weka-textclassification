            First of all let me start by saying that I am not a big fan of Japanese cars in general. They tend to be well built and reliable but are also usually boring, lacking soul and have some very specific styling treats that turn me off. This car is an exception that I hope will start to change the rule...

That said let's move on to the review.

This car is another example of what the Japanese do best. Copy and improve. I have nothing against that. It's a free world and a free industry. But it seems to me like this time they copied, improved and actually added some originality to the package which is a great step for Toyota.

After spending some time with an IS300 sedan equipped with the 17" wheels and the manumatic transmission here are my views...

<b>PROS:</b>

This is a very well built car. There is nothing here that comes short of AUDI or even Mercedes initial quality. This car was built with Toyota/Lexus standards and that is enough to ensure a long life of enjoyable driving. Dont expect to be left on the side of the road or to have your leather break and tear for the next several years. I liked the feeling of the controls and the plastics, leather and alcantara are just top notch. 

The exterior of the car has a boy racer look that is quite pleasing. A very sexy, sporty look without being too much in your face. It states that this car is a handler and not a cruiser and sure enough it is. It's nice to see a Japanese car express personality through styling. They are learning...

And talking about styling... The interior of this car is spectacular. I love the styling. Again expressing lots of personality. This is a car for live hard, play hard type folks. Much like the BMW 3 series and the AUDI A4 are. They got it right here. The perforated pedals (Ferrari Style), the cronograph look on the dash, the small steering wheel and those beautiful alcantara/leather front seats. Great stuff. 

The stereo is absolutely fantastic as in Lexus' tradition.

The price of this car is very attractive. Not many options and all at a reasonable value. BMW are you listening???

And finally the handling. This is a great handling car. They copied and they improved. It is a point it and go car. Feels safe, is fast enough and you feel like you are one with the road, typical 3 series and A4 style. But this car adds a little on the rough side. It's almost a little less tame than the 3 series which is fine with me. I liked it.
A lot.


<b>CONS:</b>

On the negative side I would have to say that the exterior styling is typically Japanese. While I like what it says (see above) I dont like how it says it... It's too much like a car out of a cartoon. Lacking that serious (I mean business) look of the 330 or the A4. But then again this is a personal issue. And since this is the new kid on the block maybe it should look younger...

Although handling is great the ride is a little harsh at times and it feels like it could use a softer setting. But body roll was a priority here and I suppose if you stay away from pot holes you will not notice.

The back seat is cramped. Again BMW 3 series style. This is one thing they did not need to copy though... A larger driver like myself will make things very difficult for someone sitting behind me. 

Finally the gear box. The manumatic is a great idea but the fact is it is too awkward to use and does not respond fast enough. I like manuals and I found myself just not being able to enjoy the manumatic much. The auto transmission is racy enough that you can have some good fun with the engine. And the manumatic concept needs some work to compete with a manual...

<b>CONCLUSION:</b>

This is a finely built car. A car that turns heads. A car with one of the nicest (and most original) interior styling this side of the AUDI TT. And an affordable, road racing machine, designed with the 3 series and the A4 in mind but with a special asian flair in it. 

The engine and transmission are absolutely fantastic. 

If you are looking for a sport sedan throw this in your shopping list. Lexus did such a great job here that they are indeed capable of rivaling AUDI and BMW in what they do best. Cars for people who love cars. Never thought I would say that about a Japanese car... Oh, well. There is always a first time...
