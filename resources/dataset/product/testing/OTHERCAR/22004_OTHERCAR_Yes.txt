I just bought my third LS400, a 1999 model in the cool green color.

It wasn't perfect though... Some twerp at Lexus decided that the steering wheel on all '99 LS400's should be the swishy new Wood and Leather model.

This sucker, and I use the word intentionally, heats up about twice as fast in the sun as the surrounding air.  Ever fried your palms as you cruise down the freeway?

I called the Lexus 800 number and complained, leaning hard on my three time owner status.  About a day later I got a call from the dealer's service manager.  &quot;Would I care to care to schedule an appointment for my wheel replacement?  They would fit a 1998 all-leather model at no charge!&quot;

Do I love this car?  No question.  There is not a finer automobile made on the planet.  Are they &quot;relentless in their pursuit of perfection?&quot;

You be the judge...<p>
