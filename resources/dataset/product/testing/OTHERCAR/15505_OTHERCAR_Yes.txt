            I've owned my car for about 6 months and it has been my only 4-wheeled vehicle.  I am still just as obsessed with it today as I was the day I bought it. I chose the Z over an S2000 because I am not really a convertible fan, and I preferred the torque in the Z over the motorcycle-like response of the S2000.  This review pertains to the Track model, which has different features than other models.

First, let me say this: the 350Z is a sports car. It is a performance automobile intended to accelerate quickly, stop quickly, and go fast around corners. Relative to the average 4-door sedan:
- it rides rough
- it will not haul a 27" television in the trunk
- it will not run in snow with stock tread

This should be obvious, but many 350Z buyers end up selling their Z's due to one of these reasons.  If these are deterrents, consider the Z's sister car, the Infinity G35, which has four seats and a 'slightly' more plush ride.


Power/Drivetrain:
The engine is very torquey, with 200ft-lb of torque from 1200rpm (maxing out at 274lb-ft @ 4800rpm).  It is very smooth, and it pulls like a tank.  It also has a very respectable 287hp @ 6200rpm.  During spirited driving, I've broken the rear wheels loose in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gear.

The engine does not have much character, as there is no rev range in which the car 'comes alive'.  It simply has torque everywhere.  You can certainly get cars with more power in this price range, but the Z's engine serves it well and is more than adequate to make the car hustle.  The exhaust is throaty at low revs, but has a slightly more exotic sound past 4k.

The car is RWD with a viscous limited slip differential.  With the LSD the car has no problem putting power to the rear wheels, but too much gas during a turn will send the rear end sideways.

The shifter is not nearly as crisp as an RX-8 or an S2000 (which has the best shifter feel of any car I've ever driven), but it has a good feel and the physical position of the shifter seems perfect.  The shifter is short and pretty chunky, but mine has loosened up nicely after 7000 miles. 


Handling/Suspension:
The neutral handing of the Z inspires confidence.  It has little body roll and tons of grip.  The steering is fairly heavy but it has a good feel.  I usually drive with both hands on the wheel, even while cruising down the interstate.

Mashing the accelerator to the floor during a turn will easily kick the rear end out. VDC helps with this.  VDC will apply braking to specific wheels during a corner if it detects that the car is sliding.  VDC also cuts engine power to prevent the rear wheels from slipping due to excessive power.  VDC can be overprotective during spirited driving.  However, if VDC is disabled, be prepared.  Even with the stock tread that everyone gripes about, it grips better than any other car I've ever driven in wet weather.  However, I'd suggest keeping VDC on in the wet.

I opted for the Track model, which adds front and rear spoilers, underbody diffusers, but most importantly: Brembo brakes and lightweight 18" rims.  The lightweight rims are 7-8lbs lighter than the other stock 18" rims.  They cause the Track model to ride a bit rougher because the lessened unsprung weight allows the wheels to react much more quickly to the changing pavement.

The Z is not a snow mobile.  It sits very low and it comes standard with summer tires. Unfortunately, I must drive my Z in snow until next year.  I have had only a little experience with the car in snow, but its traction is horrible with the stock summer tires.  Snow tires would help, but I'd rather apply struggle through this winter and later apply the $800 to a second vehicle.  The rubber compound of the stock summer tires also cause the tires to be much harder in cold weather, meaning that traction is reduced greatly in cold weather.


Braking:
My Track model has Brembo 4-piston front calipers (stock has 2) and 2-piston rear calipers (stock has 1).  The brake feel is very linear, and they will stop the car incredibly quickly. The brakes are not grabby at all.  Everything I read leads me to believe that the benefit the Brembos provide is only seen during racing.  Tests conducted show that the Brembos and the stock brakes are equivalent until repeated braking cause the stock brakes to fade.


Accommodations:
The seats are very comfortable, with good lateral support.  There is no glove box, but it has pockets for stuff everywhere: behind the seats, in the console, in the dash, on the seats, etc.  The rear strut tower does indeed cut the storage in the trunk in half.  However, you can still easily fit items such as a large suitcase, duffle bags, a load of groceries, etc., in the trunk. The design of the rear window makes rear visibility somewhat limited.  It gives a good view of the pavement directly behind you.

The quality of the materials used in the interior on the dash and doors is not as good as an equivalent BWM, Acura, or Porsche, but they serve their purpose.


Styling:
The styling speaks for itself.  I'm obviously biased and love the flared fenders, fastback profile, and limited overhang.  Nissan makes no attempt to hide its intention to compete directly with Porsche (Boxter S, actually), and the styling shows this.  The car's profile is very similar to a Porsche 911.  This car draws attention: people give me 'thumbs-up' on the highway, start conversations at the gas station, and will even ask you questions while waiting for the traffic light to change.


Aftermarket:
The 350Z is an enthusiasts' car, and there is a ton of aftermarket support for the car: suspension, engine, body kits, transmission, drivetrain, etc.


Service:
I have had my car in for a few minor service issues, and have been less than impressed with service.  The dealer scratched the exterior roof of my car and claimed no responsibility for the damage (they've since agreed to pay to have the roof professionally buffed).  They've also failed to correct the issues during initial visits. I've also had the dealer forget to look at issues and had to bring the car back for another visit.  It's a shame because I love the car.  Due to this, I will probably not buy another Nissan.
