            Could I love this digital camera any more than I do?

If you want oodles of bouncy puppy happiness, then this is the digital camera for you.  The Kodak DC 5000 combines solid practicality with a range of options and convenience.

I bought mine recently, choosing to go with a 32MB memory card instead of the standard 8MB card that comes with the camera.  This allows me far greater numbers of high quality photos (48 instead of 12)and a whopping 136 photos at the low range.  I tend to spend my holidays on long trips with little chance of returning to my computer, so this is the best option for me.  

Having used this camera on two holidays so far, I can say that it has been well worth the expense.  I don't have to buy wads and wads of film anymore!  Yay!  This makes holidays so much easier, because you don't have to plan for the extra expense and space that film or developed photos takes up.  No more worries about whether that spectacular shot you took turned out, either, because you'll know immediately.

Speaking of which, you will be amazed by the true to life colour of the Kodak DC 5000 digital photos.  Looking back at our holiday snaps in South Australia brings back so many memories, because the colours are exactly as we remember them.  

The camera excels when it comes to taking portraits.  I have been able to capture a variety of different styles of portrait photo.  Daytime photos are better than night-time due to the super-intense white-light flash.  Im going to experiment with white gauze to see if this softens the effect.  On the other hand, taking shots in low-light without flash does work!  Particularly if you use Adobe Photoshop or similar to work it up.  

Being weatherproof, I feel much more comfortable about taking the DC 5000 anywhere I happen to be.  With other digitals, I might feel a little wary about it, and that's the last thing I want from a camera.  

The two million pixels maximum resolution is fantastic for me, as I am a freelance writer and publicist for a charity.  Part of that role includes putting together a quarterly newsletter, and having a digital camera has made our options for publication so much broader than ever before.

So easy to use, that I am sure that even a beginner in photography would enjoy using this camera.  The fact that you can show your pictures instantly on any modern television, there are snap on optional lenses (I bought the wide angle) and that it is so compact and discreet just adds to the overall value of this amazing little machine.

Downsides?  I would like more snap on lens options with real zoom power.  I have bought a wide angle and additional zoom lens, but its only 1.5extra on top of the standard 3.9x zoom built into the camera.  I think I want about 10x!
When using the digital zoom mode, you must keep the camera steady, as the shot will be easily blurred if either you or the subject moves.  As I said previously, the flash can be a bit too bright, but at least the red-eye option works well.

Price-wise, its extremely good value, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to venture into digital photography.
