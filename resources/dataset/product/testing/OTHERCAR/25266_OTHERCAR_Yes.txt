            Love this SUV.... have about 10k so far on it.  Did TONS of research on all suv's both large and small,including its crash test results from Australia,(see www.4wdonline.com/a safety2.html)since the US Gov. has not crash tested it. I've also looked at consumer reports as well as AOl member reviews. ETC ETC
     I know they get a bit expensive but trust me so is everyone else. Once you test drive you will know what i mean when i tell you the ride is amazing. The car is built well... and like a tank.  Every part fits together like it was meant to.  The doors are heavy but for 45k and up they should be heavy.  Gas milage is it's only downfall.  In the city you will average 13-15.. may get up to 17 on the highway at 65mph on cruise control.  The engine is very,very quiet..make sure you don't start it while running.  Compared to the chey,ford and even lincoln there is no comparision in reliability, safety and ride.  This is a car for the long term and if you interested in buying a reliable 7-8 seat suv that does not feel like a truck and that you know will be there for you in the long run..this is it!!! hope this helped Lastly the suspension is car like not truck like.. It's one of the few cars where you can go off road or pull up at a fancy wedding and both times feel right at place.  Third seat is just for kids as leg room to small however can fit three adults in back seat.  One more thing the car has no tether attachment for a car seat.  When negotiating consider having the dealer throw that in.I paid 1k extra for the 6 year 100,000 bumber to bumber warranty... not sure I should have.. but fixing this tank i thought in a couple of years may get expensive.  check Edmunds.com to find out what the dealer paid(roughly 46k on the 2000) so you can work a good deal. They will come down don.t forget the 2% dealer hold back  they get as long as it does not sit on their lot for more then 90 days. It adds up to close to a grand with this price tag.. Good luck it took me 6 months of research before I bought mine but in the end..bottom line I would get the same exact one today(maybe minus the extended waranty) but that's a personal call since the more expensive they are to buy usually the more expensive they are to fix.<br><br>
