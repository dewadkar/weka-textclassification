            With the arrival of my second child rapidly approaching I decided it was time to trade in our small car (Saturn SL1) for something more family friendly.  I looked at several makes and models before narrowing the field to the GM vans and the Ford Windstar.

After driving several Windstars I was left with an uneasy feeling.  I started to doubt the minivan concept.  How could I possibly drive something that wallowed around every turn and was just no fun.

Then I tried my hand at a used Chevy Venture.  What a difference!  But wait, this is supposed to be about the Olds Silhouette.... it is.  As you may or may not know the 3 GM minivans (Venture, Montana and Silhouette) are all about the same mechanically.  

Ultimately I decided upon the Olds minivan for 2 main reasons.  Their 'Bottom Tier' GS model was exactly what I was looking for, cloth seats none of the fancy DVD players or rear stereo stuff.  It had the Touring Suspension with built in Air Compressor and was the extend wheelbase.  Add to that the added bonus of the 5 year 60,000 mile warranty Vs 3 year 36,000 of the others and you have a winner.

The Silhouette has met or exceeded all of my expectations.  I am unsure how I managed to survive without it for so long.  My back no longer hurts from putting my children into their car seats. I no longer bang my head on the doorframe while putting my kids in the car. I can haul around much more stuff than some of the big SUVs. I get decent gas mileage (23 MPG in town, 32 MPG highway).  And to top it all off it doesn't feel like a minivan.  With design help from Opel to be used in Europe this van feels much more like a car and is actually quite the good handling vehicle.

I really like the Captains Chairs in the Center with the 60/40 bench in the rear for seating up to 7.  It fits a Pack-N-Play crib, Double Stroller and other baby gear with ease, and room to spare.

After 1 year of driving this van it has needed nothing but regular maintenance.  Tire rotation, Oil Changes and Gas.  That is all.

The ergonomics are excellent.  I have yet to see a stereo interface design as good as the one in this Olds.  Big easy to read numbers, big knobs for tuning and volume.  The RDS feature is also neat, if not used much by radio stations.

One year of OnStar comes standard with a new Olds, but we haven't used it even once.  At first blush it sounds like a really cool idea, but after some deep contemplation it is really scary .  OnStar knows who you are and where you are at all times.  One more step towards a Big Brother watching us... Scary  Add to that the fact that I have never used it for any reason.... The car hasn't broken down, I haven't locked my keys in as the remote keyless feature is really fairly smart, I didn't get the premium package that gives directions.   It may be handy in the instance that your airbags deploy simply because it will call the rescue squad for you. 

For all of the good there are some not so great things about this van.  First of all the Automatic Headlights are just a pain.  They do not turn on when it gets cloudy or when it starts to rain. They do turn on  when I pull into the garage and I am unable to turn them off.  They will come on even if I have the parking lights selected.

The Spare tire seems like it would be hard to get out.  I haven't tried to get it out. I haven't needed to.  But it is in there tight.

The Compressor cover doesn't latch securely.  OK that is a really nit-picky detail.  If I am being that nit-picky it should speak to the quality of this vehicle.

If you have the need to haul people and things, do not care about the mini-van stigma and aren't manipulated by the SUV fad this is the perfect car for you.  I have hauled beds, kids, adults, landscaping material and nothing in this car.  It isn't what I would choose for a pleasure drive at the beach.  But for real life it is a perfect compromise between fun to drive and utility.
