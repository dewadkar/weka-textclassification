            I purchased a used 1995 Chevy Blazer this summer prior to the birth of our baby. I was looking for a reliable SUV that offered 4 wheel drive capabilities as well as a lot of storage space for strollers, diaper bags, and all of the other items that babies can't live without. While I am pleased with the 4x4 aspects as well as the roomy interior, I have not found my Blazer to be very reliable. Since June 1999, we have replaced brake pads, an idle arm, two oil lines, and an oil plug. I have also had a great deal of electrical trouble. The fuse that controls the back hatch, the horn, and the interior lights blows often. I know that I've replaced the fuse at least fifty times. The vehicle has been in the dealership three times and they can't fix it! They don't know what to do to solve this aggravating problem. I know that you roll the dice when you purchase a used car, but I had higher hopes for an SUV like the Blazer which has such a high price tag. I had hoped for quality but have only gotten trouble!<br><br>
