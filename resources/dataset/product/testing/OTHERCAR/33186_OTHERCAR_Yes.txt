            Size:

The most compact for the F series, very thin in thickness and weight around 140 g with battery.  It's really the camera that can put in the shirt pocket or hang as a mobile phone.

Outlook:

The material of the case is metallic aluminim, rather cool and futuristic. The lens cover is good for protection.  Anyway you can use the viewfinder to get the rough setting first.  The start-ups is fast.

Ease of Use:
As for beginner/daily use level, the quick menu buttons on the back is very convenient for you to swicth to movie mode and adjust zoom, flash & modes.

As a bonus, there is also a self-timer.

Comments:
Only 2 valid megapixel & digital zoom, I have it for my kids for causual shots.  Pic quality is fine for 4" x 6". And the LCD cannot cover all the area. Poor for night shots as predictable. The using of a new XD cards formatt is also why I do not turn back to old models. The main point is the price, it is only $270.- But if you have (or dunno mind to) Smartmedia, the Finepix 50i , 40i or 30i is also good to buy instead as these 3 can play MP3 music.  For better picture quality and more advance setting the Minolta Dimage Xi is much better, in such size range.

Accessories:

Come with a cradle ( for connect with PC, TV ), battery (NP-40 which is very small) & an adaptor.  You may need to buy an extra battery $25 or a slim case ( i use a PDA case n look smart ) and expensive xD cards as well.
