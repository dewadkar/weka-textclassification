            I have been wanting a digital camera for quite some time, but haven't been able to afford one.  I finally decided to buy the Polaroid PDC700 for $218, thinking that if I loved it - it was a great bargain, and if I didn't like it so much - it was a good bargain.
Well, I have decided that it is a great bargain and I am very pleased with it.  I know that there are a lot of digital cameras out there with more features and better performance, but not at this price!
I found that the camera is very easy to use - good thing since the user manual that comes with it doesn't cover much in depth.  There is one thing that I find a little annoying - battery usage.  Take my advice on this one - use rechargeable batteries.  This camera sucks up batteries like there's no tomorrow.  Good side of this is the fact that it requires 4 AA batteries, very easy to find. 
I love the video to TV output.  We take some pictures at home and then put them up on the TV for the kids to see.  Bigger and better than previewing them on the LCD or computer.
The internal memory is okay, not enough for me now that I have really delved into using the camera all of the time.  So I will be on the market for a new camera soon, at which time I can hand this one down to my family.  I highly recommend this to the beginner, and think most will agree that for the price, the Polaroid PDC700 is fantastic.  <br><br>
