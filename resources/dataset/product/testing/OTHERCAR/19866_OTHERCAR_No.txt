            I purchased a 1999 S-10 with a 4 cylinder engine.  Thought this was a good move because I need to be able to carry loads and get good gas mileage at the same time.  Turns out the 4 cylinder was a big mistake.  It has absolutely no power what so ever.  Just to get up a small hill on the interstate it must kick in the passing gear to maintain 70mph. This is when I have nothing in the truck but me. So much for gas mileage since I do most of my driving on the interstates in hill covered areas.
I like the body style, and the interior, but the paint job is just as weak as the engine. I can scratch the paint off with my finger.  I have actually done this, after I noticed how everything seemed to scratch the paint.
The insides of the truck are very roomy considering it is a compact truck.  I got the bucket seat option and love them.  With the 3rd door I can access the back of the cab for loading and unloading with ease.  There is a seat in the back but I do not know who could actually sit back there, unless they are very slim or 5 years old.  Good thing I don't have too many riders.
When I first got the truck I thought it would be with me for a very long time, but considering it's lack of power and the way the paint is rubbing off I think I better trade it in this year for something with as much comfort but with a little more pep and a better paint job.<br><br>
