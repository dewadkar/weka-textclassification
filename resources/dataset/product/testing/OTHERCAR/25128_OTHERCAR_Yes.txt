            Been using the Canon Digital Elph S110 Powershot after having used the Sony Mavica family of cameras as well as the Kodak DC 280 and 3400. I have to Say that the Canon S100 is by far the best. For all the same features, you get with the other cameras, you get so much more with The Canon! It's got a small form factor that really makes it so convenient to carry around. That's the huge advantage with this camera. Who wants to lug around their beastly Sony Mavica around after using this? (and who wants to use floppy disks anyways!!)

After using the S100 for awhile, I traded up to the S110. It's got the same fantastic size as the S100 and improved optics. the addition of the movie-mode for small AVI movies is great! Otherwise there's little difference between the S100 and S110, and I heartily recommend both!! The included software package for BOTH Mac and PC is great, with easy setup and lots of great features. Just another reason to go with Canon Digital Cameras!

It's easy to set up, and the picture quality is fantastic. You can't beat that! My only gripes: Canon doesn't include a spare battery, the stock Compact Flash card is ONLY 8 MB, and there is no case included! Kinda cheap for a camera that is really nice!The PowerShot S110 features an elegant, stainless steel (SUS316) body equipped with a number of advanced camera features including a 35-70mm (35mm equivalent) f/2.8-4.0 all-glass aspherical lens to help minimize image distortion. A 4x digital converter extends the zoom range of the lens to 8x when used in conjunction with its 2x optical zoom capabilities. In addition, the camera is equipped with a three-point AiAF autofocus system that permits the camera to automatically select the primary subject, even if the subject is off-center. To further simplify overall operation, the Digital ELPH displays most camera settings on the LCD monitor. While using the control buttons at the base of the monitor, users can confirm desired camera functions identified on the LCD monitor with easy-to-understand icons or minimal text. 

The Digital ELPH features a 0.37-inch, 2.1 megapixel CCD sensor that creates full color or black-and-white images up to 1600x1200 pixels when set to the camera's Large resolution mode. The camera also offers an additional resolution setting of 640 x 480 when set in the Small mode, which is ideal for on-screen applications, such as Web sites and CD-ROMs and allows more images to be recorded on a single CompactFlash memory card. The new camera is compatible with Type I CompactFlash Cards and will be shipped with an 8MB CF card. 

In order to maximize the capabilities of the 2.1 megapixel CCD, the PowerShot S100 is equipped with a dedicated digital signal processing integrated circuit (IC) to achieve high-speed and complete processing of image detail. All images are recorded as JPEG files and a built-in buffer memory allows continuous burst-mode shooting of up to 2 frames per second when set to its maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200. The interval between shots in single frame mode is only 1.7 seconds. In addition, basic operations such as camera start-up, high-speed search mode during playback, image enlargement and image scrolling can now be executed swiftly, due to the digital signal processing IC's high-speed compression and decompression operations. 

The photo quality I get from printing pics from ofoto.com is fantastic! Sharp and easy on the eyes. Costco recently started printing pictures too. Their quality is similiar to Ofoto.com, and lest costly. Color saturation is not quite as rich though, with a few pics looking more greenish.

I got mine from Outpost.com because they had free shipping and NO tax!! Yay! Also, if you shop through Ebates, you get another 5% back!! (you can use them FREE to shop at many other stores for up to 25% back!)
