            For the price this is a great pick-up plenty of leg room just the right size truck for hauling just about anything. The only draw back I have with this vehicle is the four cylinder engine not peppy enough they should have made the six cylinder standard in all there Dakotas. I test drove Ranger and the Chevrolet S-10 but the Dakota had more room and style I believe it to be the better buy. I would recommend this truck to all my family and friends. The warranty Chrysler sells with there vehicles is an excellent buy takes care of about everything mechanical.<br><br>
