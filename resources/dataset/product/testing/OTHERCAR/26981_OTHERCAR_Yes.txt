               The Previa LE that I currently drive has been in my family since it was new. Originally, it was my mom's car and delivered 153,000 trouble-free miles. I 'got' the car last year when my mom bought her Lexus RX300 and have enjoyed every minute of it. Even though it is a van and most certainly not the best for attracting looks from passerby, it gets the job done in the traditional Toyota workhorse fashion.

   The car was bought with the optional All-Trac all-wheel drive system. The problem is not the AWD system itself (it works seamlessly to this day) but the fact that it sucks more power from an already overworked engine. 145 horsepower is assigned to lug 3,000+ pounds around and has a hard time of it sometimes. Where I live, the hills can be long and steep and the little 2.4 liter I-4 has a hard time keeping the car moving. Often, the A/C must be turned off in order to keep it going up the hill. Plus, it gives passengers a startle when the transmission is forced to kick down to 2nd gear at 35 or 40 mph in order to maintain a constant speed. You get used to it though, and thank goodness for the overdrive off switch.

   Fuel mileage isn't that thrifty and even when driving conservatively, I haven't been able to yield much better than 16 to 17 mpg.

   Nobody does interiors better than Toyota and the Previa is no exception. The gray cloth seats are wearing like iron, showing no signs of deterioration, even at 11 years of age and 156,000 punishing miles. The speedometer is right where it is easy to see with large numbers and a prominent amber needle that gives a clear indication every time. All warning lights are neatly ordered and right where one would expect them to be. The stalks for turn signals and wipers are firm and deliver positive clicks when engaged. The only ergonomic flaw is that the shifter, when in drive, blocks the miniscule radio power/volume knob, making it very easy to knock the shifter rather than the volume. The radio display is crisp and clean, with nothing excessive to block it. Climate controls are simple slider knobs that are clearly marked and easy to use. The clock is right where everyone (even those in the 3rd row) can see it. It is mounted just above the interior rearview mirror.

   Visibility is relatively good with a few flaws. The huge windshield offers a forward view second to none as do the rear windows. There are two problems, though. Although I'm only 5' 11", but I have to crane forward in order to see the traffic lights at intersections if I'm first in line, very problematic for anyone over 5' 7" or so. Secondly, with the 3rd row seats stowed, they block rearward vision, creating a huge blind spot. I nearly changed lanes into a Subaru the other day without even seeing him until he pulled along side me. Night visibility is great through that windshield, although the headlights were too weak. I recently bought a set of Sylvania Silverstar headlights and they are so much better than the old ones. I would recommend these to anybody with headlight problems.

   Cargo space is trying with the 3rd row down but with the seats folded up, it becomes vast. The only disadvantage is the presence of the U-shaped locks used to hold the seats down when in use. Even after all these years, it still hurts like you know what to smash your knee on those horrid steel U locks. Additionally, they tend to catch cargo you are attempting to load and that sudden stop sends you into whatever you're loading.

   Problems have been, minimal, to say the least. The only two 'major' issues I can recall are a broken passenger seatbelt reel and something to do with the brake pump. We just had the 150,000 mile tuneup done (late, I know) and the whole shebang set us back a mere $174 including an A/C freon recharge and a new air filter. The car still runs like new and with cold A/C on tap, we can tackle summer!
