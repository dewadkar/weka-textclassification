            My wife was the proud (?) owner of a 1991 Pontiac Sunbird when we married.  The car was a white, 4-door model with blue cloth interior.  For the two of us, it seemed like it would be a fine car to have.  After a couple of years, we discovered that it was not a very good "family" car.

The inside of the Sunbird was comfortable, but a little small.  Whenever we had passengers in the car, we found that they just didn't have much room to sit.  It made for a less-than-comfortable ride for four people.  The dashboard had the typical cheap look that all Pontiacs had at that time.  Although the car was only two or three years old, it rattled constantly.  This was a car that had had one owner, had never been in an accident, and had been taken care of during its' life.  Nothing we could do would stop the rattling.  

The mechanical side of the Sunbird was somewhat better than the comfort.  We did not have many mechanical problems, but the ones that we did have always seemed to be big.  The struts had to be replaced much earlier than I would have anticipated, for example.  I also found that this car needed the fuel filter changed almost constantly.  

The final straw came one night when the Sunbird quit on the side of the highway in the middle of the night.  Luckily, someone stopped to help us, and we were able to have it towed in to our local mechanic.  He spent the entire day looking over the car, trying to find the problem.  It turned out that the car was out of gas...but the gas gauge read 1/4 of a tank!  This car got good mileage, so continuing to drive with 1/4 tank was not risky.  Even the mechanic could not explain how this could happen.  This incident convinced me that it was time to get a new car.

In hindsight, the Sunbird is not the worst car I have ever had.  At the same time, it is definitely not the best.  While I would consider getting a Pontiac in the future, I will stay away from this model.
