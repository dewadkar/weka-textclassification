            For years (decades, actually), I have wanted a sports car.  While I was helping to raise a family, that was out of the question.  Now that we are "empty nesters," it became a possibility again.  I read a lot of articles and test drove a number of cars and decided on a 2001 Celica GT with a 5-speed transmission. I know, it isn't really a sports car; but it is a sporty car!  In other words, it isn't exactly what I had started out hoping to get.  But I soon learned that what I really wanted was considerably out of my price range.  However, after looking at the options, the Celica satisfies most of them at a very reasonable cost.
The handling and breaking are superb, in my opinion.  I enjoy going around corners, simply because the feeling is unlike any I have had before.  The car sticks to the road and it feels like you could go twice as fast and still not have a problem.  But like most drivers (not the ones that test cars for the magazines), I go fast enough to enjoy the thrill; but not so fast that I am in any danger of losing control of the car.  I am very impressed with the breaks on this car.  I hope I never have to go from 60 to 0 is 100 ft., but I have no doubt that I could.  I have only had the car for four months and my gas mileage has varied from 23 - 31 mpg.
Whether or not the styling of the Celica appeals to you is a personal choice.  My own opinion is that it is one of the better-looking cars on the road, particularly from the front.  The front hood slope and the headlights are very appealing and the look of the future, as far as I am concerned.  One unique feature to the headlights is that they don't just throw light in front of the car; they focus light in front of the car.  The light is so focused that, when you pull up behind another car at night, your headlights do not shine in their back window.  This is hard to explain if you haven't experienced it, but it is very cool and a very efficient use of the small, round headlights.
The only real drawback I see is that it is somewhat difficult to see well enough for changing lanes with total confidence.  But a lot of other sporty cars I drove had the same problem, so I don't see it as unique to this vehicle.  Some people have complained about the quality of materials on the dash.  But I am the only one who will be driving this vehicle and I don't plan on abusing it; so I don't think that is a significant worry.  Others complain about the lack of room in the back seat.  Again, I don't see the problem.  At least it has one; and with the seats folded down, there is a surprising amount of cargo area.
I am 5' 9" tall, with a medium build, and the car fits me very well.  Once I slip into the front seat, I feel like I am part of the car.  I am not cramped at all, but feel comfortably surrounded.  The ride is very good for a car this size; better than I expected, as a matter of fact.  My son-in-law, who is 6' 5" tall and weighs 265 lbs. has also driven the car, but I wouldn't recommend it for people that size.
In short, I would like to enthusiastically recommend this car for anyone out there who is looking for a quality, sporty-feeling car at a reasonable price.   I can't wait to get into this car every day; just so I can have the fun of driving it.
