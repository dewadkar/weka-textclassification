<b>7 month report</b>

I've had my silver Eclipse (the silver bullet, hi ho silver, etc etc) for 7 months now and I'm having a great time driving it, still.  Here's my report on living with this car, for at least an hour each day up and down I-95.  Also included below is a general description of some of the features.

- The car is quite comfortable.  The power seat really helps me find a good driving position.  Headroom is not enough, though.  I'm 5' 10.5" and if I had poofy hair I wouldn't fit.  As it is, if I sit up straight I can press my head into the roof liner.  I find myself leaning slightly to the right as I drive.  I don't notice this normally, but every once in a while I think the design team must have been rather diminutive.  The car is comfortable on long drives, though I haven't done any multi-day road trips yet.

- Transmission has a good feel.  The stick is placed appropriately and has a nice short throw.  You have to push the clutch all the way in to get the car to start, though.  At first I thought something was wrong with it (there is an interlock that won't let the car start without the clutch being depressed).  Anything larger than a can of soda will make it awkward to reach the stick.

- Climate control is great.  The heater puts out <b>hot</b> air at maximum setting, and the air conditioner does its job well.  Fan noise level is par for the course.

- Visibility is very good.  The spoiler doesn't obstruct the rear view excessively, but it seems to be at the right height to block headlights.  Side view mirrors, properly adjusted, are big enough to provide a good view of nearby cars.

- We had an alloy fuel door thrown in with the deal.  It looks much better, plus the plastic one that ships with the car is so flimsy.  If you've already got an Eclipse, treat yourself to a little upgrade for $100.

- This car is fast.  The V6 can really get you going in a hurry.  Highway acceleration is very good as well.  Some people miss the turbo.  Given the choice between a 4 cylinder with a turbo and the V6, I'll take the 6.  The old GS-T turned in a 0-60 time of 6.5 seconds; the new GT clocks in at 7.3 seconds (according to Car and Driver magazine).  So it's not as quick.  My drag racing days ended with high school.  I prefer the smooth power curve of a normally aspirated (non-turbo) car and while the V6 can't match the purr of a well-tuned V8 (though it does have a nice throaty rumble), the sound is better than a little 4.  It has a higher top speed than the old turbo, 140 mph vs 131.  No turbo means one less thing to break down.

- Handling is solid.  The power-assisted steering system is excellent; you feel as if you're a part of the road.  Torque steer (the tendency of a front wheel drive car to pull to one side) is very noticeable at high RPMs in 1st and 2nd gear.  One knock: turning radius is not as small as one would expect.  This car has a turning radius only slightly better than our minivan.  The only place you'll notice this is in a parking lot or making a U-turn, but it is annoying.

- Rear seat room is small, as you'd expect to find in a sports car.  The rear seat will hold 2 child seats and the trunk has 2 tether strap mounts.

- Other nice touches: front seat side airbags, after turning off the car the doors and windows are powered for 30 seconds or until a door is opened, gauges are well shaded (no glare) and have a white background, which looks cool.  The car looks sporty and is an improvement over past models which looked more sedan-like.  Some of the styling comes from the discontinued 3000GT line.

- Not nice things: the doors seem to retain water more than in other cars.  Rolling down and up the windows after a rain (or after washing the car) will leave wet streaks on the window.

- Neutral things: The car has a cigarette lighter and ashtray.  That's so retro now; most cars seem to offer those as an option instead.  Car takes premium fuel.  That makes it a little more expensive to fill up, but that's the price you pay for a performance engine.

- No major problems yet.  We've performed normal maintenance thus far.  I had to use some WD-40 on the fuel door as a spring was sticking a little.  Center console has become a little loose, though that shouldn't be hard to correct.
