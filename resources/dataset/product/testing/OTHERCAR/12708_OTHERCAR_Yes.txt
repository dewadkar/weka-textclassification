            I really was not happy with the car that I purchased.  Of course, this is only a personal opinion and may have more to do with the dealership than the car.  Yes, the car works fine.  Air conditioning is great (the heat gets really hot fast so it is good during the winter), the stereo is average (but it's a factory) and it is comfortable to drive.  The car runs smoothly and does not idle as hard as the previous model.  I like the trunk, it is big and roomy and you can fold down the back seat for the larger items.  The only problem with the back seat is the entire thing folds down so if you are hauling something large, nobody can sit back there.  The car has adjustable head rests and seat belts for the front seats and the back seat has two three-point seat belts and a single belt in the middle.  The glove compartment is large, but the only other storage space is small and between the two front seats.  The gas mileage is relatively good (I get about 28/32).

I do not recommend this car unless you are looking for a cheap car that will last a few years.  It's a good car for high school students, but if you are going away to college I wouldn't recommend making long trips in this car.  Already I have had to replace the brakes twice, completely.  I have had the car for a little less than two years.  It is a good car, but the old adage is true, &quot;You get what you pay for.&quot;<br><br>
