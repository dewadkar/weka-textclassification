            The Chevy Tahoe is a very enjoyable vehicle. But your ownership experience may not be if you don't have all the information available to you before you buy.

We purchased a 1996 Chevy Tahoe LT 4 door 4WD model. My initial impression of the vehicle was very positive. Frankly, my opinion of GM cars in the '80's was quite low, and I had been hesitant to purchase the vehicle in the first place. But now that I had taken delivery, things were different. Our vehicle was ordered with just about every option available except the engine block heater (which we didn't need) and the cassette deck (which we didn't want since we were getting the CD). In addition, I chose the manual transfer case to 4WD rather than the electronic push-button option. I think it was my subconscious fear of a potential quality problem, rather than worrying about saving the $100.

The vehicle was delivered with no noticeable factory defects. My first impressions were that the interior was a nice balance between sport utility truck-like and luxury comfort. The seats, particularly the front bucket seats, we quite comfortable and soft. The dashboard trim, shared with the other Chevy trucks, is both clean and efficient. I like GM's use of the new dial controls for climate control. The stereo controls are easy enough to figure out without the manual, with the exception of the automatic volume-adjusting feature. If you are unfamiliar with this feature, when activated, it will automatically raise the volume of the stereo as the speed of the vehicle increases and reduce it again as the vehicle slows. This feature has three settings in addition to an &quot;off&quot; setting, and is controlled by a ring around the volume dial.

But on to the rest of the vehicle. Five adult passengers (or six if you choose a front bench seat) can easily ride in comfort. Take note that there is no rear center headrest if that lack of a safety feature concerns you. The rear cargo area is terrific. It extends some four feat behind the non-removeable but collapseable rear bench seat. When folded, the rear bench makes a completely level and flat surface for hauling large objects or large quantities. Which brings me to the rear doors.

You have your choice of panel doors or a tailgate. The tailgate gives you an extra foot and a-half or so of bed for longer objects, but the panel doors give you easier access to the cargo area and the roof rack. I chose the panel doors and have been happy with them. If you plan to use the cargo area frequently, get a rubber cargo liner. I did and it's kept the carpet in the back in pristine condition.

I also purchased the Class III trailering package which includes the hitch and engine and transmission oil coolers. I've towed landscape tractors and other heavy objects and the 5.7L 255HP engine pulls these quite well. Depending on whether you choose the 2-door, 4-door, 2WD, 4WD and optional axle ratio's, your towing capacity will vary from 5500lbs. on up.

So what's to complain about? Truthfully? Not much. But, these may be significant. First, I noticed that the brakes seem a bit underpowered. Granted, this is a heavy vehicle, but the brake travel is significant and the feel is quite mushy. You'll have to put the pedal half-way to the floor to get any significant response. And in a quick stop, you'll have the pedal as far as it will go.

No rear air conditioning. In the summer, the rear occupants are not very comfortable. In addition to having no rear air controls, the air conditioning system is underpowered for such a large vehicle. The newest models have this as an expensive (but worthwhile) option. If you are going to spend a fortune on a new model, get the rear air unless you live in Alaska.

Subsequent quality issues. In the first 25,000 miles of ownership, I experienced too many quality issues for the amount of mileage. First, a vanity mirror light went out within a couple of months of delivery. No big deal. This was repaired under warranty.

After about a year or so, I noticed the rear passenger door handle was becoming sticky and would not return fully to the normal position. It got so bad that if you didn't manually push it down that the lock would not engage or disengage for that door. The dealer repaired this under warranty.

Then, the driver's power mirror stopped working. It seems the electric motor worked but the mirror came off track. After inspection, some plastic part had broken and the entire assembly had to be replaced. Initially, the dealer tried to deny a warranty repair, claiming that the damage was caused by impact, but after I argued with them to show me evidence of any impact significant enough to cause the problem, they agreed to cover the repair under warranty. I consider this a significant problem, particularly due to the fact that the repair would have cost nearly $200 and would likely be footed by the owner unless he or she could make their case as well as I did.

Then, three months after the 3/36 warranty expired, the alternator died. With less than 24,000 miles on the truck, I was extremely disappointed to say the least. I have had alternators last more than 140,000 miles on cars more than twice as old as the Tahoe. I chose to replace the alternator myself and purchased one with a lifetime warranty in order to avoid this problem again. A friend who had owned a GM car helped talk me into that after he explained that he replaced his alternator some five times in his car before he finally got rid of it. This repair cost me approximately $200 and my own labor.

Now, the rear passenger door handle is again getting sticky. If I hadn't had the alternator problem and the repeat problem with the door handle, perhaps I wouldn't feel a disappointed about my overall experience. So, if you are going to pay up to $40,000 for a new Tahoe, keep in mind that you will need to spend additional money on repairs from time to time.

The good news is that you probably won't have to perform engine repairs. The engine starts and runs flawlessly, delivers excellent power and torque and requires very little maintenance.

The rest of the fit and finish of the Tahoe has been fine thus far, including paint and materials. The carpet is Scotch-guarded and dirt and stains were removed when we cleaned the carpet.

My final view: Strongly consider a used Tahoe. The 2000 models are priced nearly $7,000 more than my 1996 was new, and with few additional features. In fact, the only worthwhile additional features are the rear air conditioning controls and possibly the third row seat. If you can overlook those, you could buy a '97 or '98 with low or moderate miles and save some $12,000.00. Be sure to stick with a '96 or newer, as that is the first year of the new Vortec engines with at least 255 horse power (as opposed to only 200hp for the '95).

Would I buy this again? Maybe. My decision would be based on a good hard look at the Ford Expedition and whether I could afford the price tag.<br><br>
