            The Kodak DC3200, is a great place to start in the realm of digital cameras. The low end price point is very nice and exactly why I picked this model. Getting started was quick, the menu layout is simple and easy to understand. 
 The overall picture quality is average at best, but for this price you can't expect much better.I found the digital zoom to be below average and annoying, this camera is best used as a point and shoot with the viewfinder, trying to use the LCD display is tedious. You will want to purchase the optional DC power pack to run the camera during computer transfer this will save you lots of batteries. As well you will find out quickly that the 2MB of starter memory is just to little so be prepared to purchase a upgrade.
