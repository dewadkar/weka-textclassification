            To my knowledge, as of 6/1/01 this model has been updated to the Canon S110. The difference is the ability to directly print to the Canon Card Photo Printer CP-10, 20 fps movie clips WITH audio, a choice of nine image quality modes, different shutter speeds, better color filter, automatic exposure adjustment, high-speed DSP processing.

<B>As with my other reviews, rather than throw technical specifics that you can look up, I refer you to http://www.powershot.com/powershot2/home.html if you are interested.</B><BR><BR>

<B>*** Overview ***</B><BR>
The Canon PowerShot S100 is really one of the most elegant, ergonomic, digital compact camera around.  I recently acquired this as a gift before the S110's debut.  This camera is exquisitely small and portable and fits in your front jeans pocket easily.  Although, it does pack some weight which probably speaks to its solidness. <BR>
<BR>
Briefly, some highlights are :<BR>
(1) 2.1 megapixel CCD delivering up to 1600x1200 images.<BR>
(2) 1.5 inch color LCD and viewfinder.<BR>
(3) 2x optical and 4x digital zoom.<BR>
(4) Built in Flash. <BR>
(5) LIon rechargable battery.<BR>
(6) Included 8 MB compact flash card.<BR>
(7) USB video cable. <BR>
(8) Image software.<BR>
<BR>

<B>Positives</B><BR>
<B>*</B>I'm sure you've read this hundreds of times but the SIZE is really something that is quite remarkable.  I'm a strong believer that if something is easier to carry around the more likely you will and the more use you will get out of it.  Here this is no exception.<BR>
<B>*</B>USB transferring of the images to computer is quick.<BR>
<B>*</B>The quality of the photos are excellent in daylight.<BR>
<B>*</B>The included software included is pretty good.<BR>
<B>*</B>Ease of use is great.  It works like a normal camera in camera mode.  Just point and shoot.  Also, when looking at the images on the CF Card, the menu driven options are pretty easy to figure out.  That is, it is easy to scroll through the images.  Look at a summary "contact" sheet, delete, and protect images.<BR><BR>

<B>Negatives</B><BR>
<B>*</B>LCD screen is good but poor viewing from angles.  Only important if you are looking at the LCD with friends.<BR>
<B>*</B>Battery is not good for an extended day (as I needed when I went to Europe).  It will fill up the 8MB card (with the viewfinder on), AND run through the pictures on the LCD screen on ONE CHARGE.<BR>
<B>*</B>8 MB CF card.  Of course this can be upgraded but it would be nice to either drop the price and remove the card completely or allow us the option to just buy a bigger card. I could fit about 10-15 pictures depending on the quality.<BR>
<B>*</B>In dark settings the pictures don't come out as clear or evenly lit. <BR>
<B>*</B>There is a slight delay between pushing the button and taking the picture.<BR>
<B>*</B>No camera case included.  You would think on a $400+ item and something of this quality deserves to have a simple case included, but there isn't.<BR><BR>

<B>Summary</B><BR>
I really like my Canon Power Shot S100.  I don't need the new s110's video capabilities.  I just want to be able to take pictures and load them on my computer.  It's great for sharing pictures with friends, taking pictures for items to sell on e-bay, and really came in handy recently during a day with my realtor when home shopping.  This way I didn't have to wait for film processing and waste money on pics I won't keep forever. If you need to ever take pictures, show them immediately, and delete them or atleast the ones you don't need -- a digital camera is for you.  The price has dropped since the advent of the S110 AND can be had for around $380 (checkout http://www.mysimon.com), which isn't bad considering a year ago it was about $600! I still, however, wouldn't toss away my 35mm or APS camera.  At 2.11 megapixels, the quality is still not perfect!  Overall though, it's a great way to get digitized pictures AND all in style!
