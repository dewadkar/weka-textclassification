            I have less than 750 miles on my new 2004 Pacifica.  My 7 passenger 1995 TransSport is still in the driveway, waiting for a new home.  The following comments may be useful particularly to those downsizing from a large minivan.

First let me say that I was attracted to this car primarily for its styling and comfort, especially for a family of four long-legged people (two adults, two teens).  The second row is unusually roomy in my experience, especially because those seats slide back for most of the time when the third row is not in use. (I would not ask anyone to sit in the third row with the second row seats all the way back and would not ask any adult to make the contortions necessary to get there.)  So, I am generally happy with the car.  However, I have the following specific comments.

1. The driver's visibility is poor in comparison with any other car I have owned.  The side pillars are wide on both sides, and the large passenger headrest blocks even more of the driver's side view.  The view to the rear is even more obstructed, with very large pillars in the rear corners.  The relatively small back window, placed high on the back hatch makes every backup maneuver somewhat of an adventure.

2. When backing up, then, I require good side view mirrors.  I find the Pacifica's mirrors too small for this purpose and will have to install those small "helper" mirrors to both outside mirrors.

3. The radio reception in the $700 (gulp) Infinity radio upgrade is abysmal.  Just about every station I tune outside a ten to fifteen mile radius is subject to enough static to make it unpleasant enough not to use.  In this day and age, there is no excuse for this.  The problem is worse if there are any natural obstructions, such as low Connecticut hills.  Very, very disappointing to an average radio listener!  Otherwise, the radio/CD/tape has good, but not great, sound. Not worth the extra money. It does not play MP3s.

4.  Traction with the all-wheel drive is excellent and a terrific new experience.  You can really feel the difference, even in everyday driving.

5.  Getting 13 miles a gallon in a suburban environment is hard to accept.  I thought the 17 MPG I was getting with my TransSport was bad, and shied away from SUV's because of their poor gas mileage.  I keep hope that it will improve.

6.  The car has good ground clearance, and a high point of view, which provides good visibility of the road ahead.  

7.  Legroom in front is good as well.  Although we have electric front passenger seats, the height is not adjustable, and passengers find the high seat height somewhat uncomfortable on a long trip. Although they can stretch, they can't really straighten their legs, which stay bent because the seat is so high.

8.  Still getting used to not having all that room for cargo.  There is barely enough room for a driver and four skiers and their gear (with the skis on the roof).  I expect camping, which has even more equipment, will be the same experience.  I am picking up a roof box later this week.  It's a shame to detract from the car's nice lines.

All in all, I like the vehicle.  Around here, everybody's getting a Pilot, so it's nice to have something different.  I get lots of positive comments from friends (and strangers) about the looks of the car.  So far, so good.  I just wish they could do something about that radio.
