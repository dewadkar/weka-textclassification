            How I miss our little 1991 Geo Prizm, our little white Corolla clone.  Say all the bad things you want about the appearance of our old car, but it lived a good life.  We recently traded it in for something newer and bigger, but we miss our old Prizm.  We had a 1991 Geo Prizm, the 4dr automatic notchback.  

My husband and I bought our 1991 Geo used (we purchased it in 1996, I believe), and it was a shame to part with it this year, but for all practical purposes, it was necessary.  It had just about 100,000 miles on the odometer, and the age showed on the exterior of this vehicle, but we always went out to that old car and knew we could count on it to start up and get us where we needed to go without fail.  Our Prizm never stalled out, never had problems starting, and it never failed to perform for us.  It even made it driving straight from New York State to Florida (GREAT gas mileage for an older car...almost 35 mpg highway), with not one tiny hint of a problem.  Sure, it had its problems toward the end, but at nine years of age, this car had only required little more than basic service.  The only &quot;major&quot; work this car ever needed was to have the radiator replaced, and that ran us $300 in 1999.  Not a huge expense, considering the age of the car.  We've had newer cars that didn't perform half as well and required many more repairs.

When we parted with our Prizm, it did require work.  This work would have cost us more than the value of the car, and when a vehicle reaches that critical point, you have to step back and realize that it's past its prime and it's time to put it out to pasture!  At the point of trading it in, it needed a new muffler, serious work on the air conditioner, and we knew it was in need of a timing belt.  And I'm sure it needed a few other things, but it still ran like a charm, quite honestly.  The exterior was rusted through in a couple of spots, due to having survived lots of winters up in New York and the damage could be attributed to the harsh road salt.  All this aside, we loved our little Prizm.  

The only qualm I had with this car (and I've heard it is common with older Prizms) was that all but one of the windows suffered broken rollers.  Approximately a year into our ownership of this vehicle, we got to the point that we had to literally pull three of the windows up, and then roll them up.  And along those same lines, the two inside back door handles broke off.  They couldn't be opened from inside, only from the outside.  It got to be unsightly and quite honestly, it was a royal pain.

Even so, it's been strange looking outside and not seeing our 1991 Prizm out there.  It lived a good life, and I'm sure it could go much further.  We drove that car onto the dealer's lot knowing it had a lot of life left in it, but I guess you had to own that old car to realize what it had to offer.  But now our family is getting bigger, we need a bit more room and we did need a newer car.  I look back at our old Prizm with a lot of fondness and I have to highly recommend a Geo (now Chevy) Prizm to anyone who is looking for a smaller car with lots of &quot;bang for the buck.&quot;
