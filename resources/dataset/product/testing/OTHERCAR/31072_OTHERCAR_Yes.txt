            About Me:  My friends believe I am crazy because every time I saw them I have been talk about getting a truck.  This went on for two years.  After I decided that I �wanted� one (note: not �needed�) because I bought a house out in the country were 4 wheel drive only roads are common, I delved into the next phase of purchasing a vehicle.

Researching:  I went to all the websites: Carpoint, Autobytel, CarsDirect, Imotors (Used), etc.  However, the best info I found was simply picking up my Consumer Reports and ordering a Car Report for about $12 for each car.  This is by far the best money for your time.  All together, I spend about 80 hours of researching all the information that was on the reports, and I have to say that everything I researched came out exactly what the report said.  In fact, some of the manufacture�s sites had incorrect information and they corrected because of my questions regarding the differences between Consumer Reports and theirs.  After considerable debate, I decided to buy the Tundra because of all the reports saying most of the things I wanted to hear.  This was way before Consumer Reports made it their top pick for pickups. 

Purchasing:  Now comes the fun part.  Every Toyota Dealer that I talked to gave me a rather bad taste in my mouth.  I both called and sent Emailed when appropriate to the 10 Toyota dealers that were close to me.  The subject of the car was this:  �I want a Toyota Tundra 4X4 Limited Access Cab with leather option in natural white or thunder grey.�  Every single dealer told me how they didn�t have any Ltds but that they had some SR5s and they could have me come out and check them out maybe they could aftermarket some leather in the truck for me.  The closest dealer to me at the time had a Limited (only one) and they had it in green (I mean Jade).  Then I told them: �I want to pay $500 over dealer invoice.�  After the laughing subsided, I left and I thought that I would have to settle for a Ford since they are much better at dealing with people.  However, I also was trying out the online purchasing and it was about time to hear back from them.  As I was calling back the last of the *many* Autobytel dealers, which happen to be the same ones I called a week earlier in my initial attempt, they finished telling me that they didn�t have what I wanted (but wanted me to come out anyway to purchase something else) I received an innocuous email that I had sent to a dealer 2 hours earlier on a whim.  I figured I would look at a Toyota Dealer that was a bit further away (not much though).  They said they had exactly what I wanted and they agreed to certain price above dealer invoice (not much different than my original�I made a deal that I wouldn�t say how much but trust me it was better than I expected) and to give them a call.  I gave them a call, an hour later I showed up on the lot expecting to be bait and switch.  There was the exact vehicle I requested, there was the sales person with her team, there were the keys, which she gave to me to test drive.  An hour later I was driving home in my new Tundra.  If you happen to be in Northern California, goto the web/fleet team at Walnut Creek Toyota, they are the best people with a good design on your purchasing since one person isn�t tied to you, each team member seemed to have a hand in the deal.  While one was prepping the car, another was with me finishing paperwork.  It was a very good feeling buying the car.  I recommend them highly and all other Toyota dealers are not recommended at all.

Now for the Truck:  I bought a White Access Cab, Limited, 4X4, Leather, and almost all the options you can get on it.

4X4: About 16 hours after purchasing I was on my way up to Tahoe to go into the snow (it was purchased in the winter).  It flawlessly engaged and did not slip once the whole time I was in the snow.  It was almost eerie how uneventful the whole trip was.  The next weekend I took it over to the Coast and when on a mud 1 foot deep 40-mile trail.  It was working fine except that I worried about the condition of the road and (considering I just bought the truck) the possibility of my having an accident, so I actually �backed� down a steep grade between one broken camper (that probably fell off someone else�s truck) and a cliff and�the Truck handled with minimal slippage.  [I was unable to turn around because of the trail.]  Other adventures included a trail trip that used to take my parents �94 Dodge 350 4X4 about two hours to cover, and turned it into a simple 40 minute excursion.  The Toyota really makes a non-professional off-roader look like a skilled wonder.  You literally point the truck where you want to go and the thing will just grind itself there.  It is wondrous.  Some issues I have is, why Toyota didn�t put in a locking differential?  But after dealing with it in tight urban traffic, I notice the hop, bop, chop whatever you call it when you take a tight turn.  A differential would probably exasperate the problem and typical Toyota people would complain that it isn�t people-friendly enough.  End result, a lock-diff will probably be an option sometime in the future, if it isn�t then an aftermarket will take care of it.

Outside:  It is about as boring looking as a Ford F-150, but not as cool looking as a Ford SuperDuty or a Dodge Ram.  With fender flares it can look a little big around the middle and everything about it seems �round�.  The pop out windows is reminiscent of their Tacoma line (in the Access Cab) and the paint, fit and finish I found were top notch.  I didn�t find any defects, and I am a picky person.  I also bought a hitch (one option the dealer didn�t have (7,500GVW)) and installed it myself, making sure that everything was square and tight when I did it.  I intimately got to know the underside of the truck by doing this myself.  I don�t suggest it for anyone else, get a friend to help you.  The strange thing is that there are many wires and electrical hooks under there ready for any option you can think of, other than a shell (which I eventually put on 6 months later).  End result, I think they should realize that people put shells on their trucks and that they should have a wiring hook for it automatically.

Inside:  Well, what can I say, but it is very nice and quiet and every time I climb up into the cabin, I feel like I am on �top of the world�.  In reality, it is just a nicely designed interior that doesn�t seem claustrophobic or anything.  In fact, if I didn�t have power windows I would seriously have problems rolling up and down the passenger window.  I am 6 foot, so it isn�t because I am small.  The oak color is rather bland I think, but that is Toyota and I bought it for reliability not totally for looks.  The leather is very nice and supple, and is not going to fall apart quickly like other domestics.  (This IN-built truck is a domestic right?)  A grey color interior with white exterior would have looked so much better, but alas that was not an option.  The seats can be a little low for comfort (if you plan on seeing everything in the instrument pod) so be prepared to get out of the truck every once in awhile on a long trip which you should do anyway.  But they are nice and at least they aren't as bad as 4Runners!  In other words Toyota is learning about the American market a little more and it really shows.  They even have useful cupholders that don't cover vents or radio controls!  Also, I didn't buy the truck for the backseats, I wanted the space behind the front seats for me...not my passengers, so having them bolt upright is a bit of a plus.  I only wish there was a way to take them out easier...

Powertrain:  The V8 (iForce if you will) is a very nice machine.  Everything you hear about it is true and the thing is just a dream.  When I first got the truck, I almost couldn�t hear it, but now that it has some miles on it, I can hear the patter patter of the engine and it really does sound nice and calming.  If you put down the accelerator, it can snap you back into the seat pretty quickly.  It is nice having a truck that has power that isn�t blown or requires some fancy High Output system like GM issues.  This is Toyota�s strong point and that is probably why their ad�s promote it so much.  The transmission on the other hand is a bit notchy when shifting (it is automatic) and I am not a freak but I know I can shift smother than it sometimes.  However, it does work and it can get you to point a and b without any fuss, so maybe that is just the way it is.  After all it is a truck and maybe it was designed to be a little harsh since it might be pulling a 7500 lbs trailer or something.  I reserve judgment until after I have had it for a year and half, about the time for something to go wrong with the transmission.

Suspension:  Get the TRD package.  Just get it.  The Bilsteins are without a doubt a better deal and the suspension is actually softer in the urban and suburban locations with it.  I just wish they wouldn�t put that ugly sticker on the back.  Comes off with a hair dryer though�

Issues that I have had with it are the Horn and the Air Conditioning.  It seems that the Air Conditioning has to be on HIGH just to get the interior cool.  With all the privacy glass and stuff I thought there shouldn�t be much dissipation of the cooler air, but it sure does take a lot to cool the interior down.  And the HIGH fan does make a bit of noise.  I wonder if they might have a fix for that sometime.  And the Horn is about the wimpiest thing I have ever heard.  I used it once and the other drive looked over to the Tercel that was next to me, probably for good reason, it might be the same type.  But I fixed that by buying Hella replacements that plugged right in (the left one had to be moved a little because of the aux transmission cooling location) and it definitely made them louder but it is the same tone.

Other than that, great truck, I intend on having awhile and am looking forward to my years with it.

But then again, that is just my opinion...<br><br>
