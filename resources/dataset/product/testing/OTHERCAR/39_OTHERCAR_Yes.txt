            I decided to purchase this particular type of SUV for two reasons : One it has the largest available engine in its class (205 HP). Larger than the Toyota Fore-Runner, the Nissan Pathfinder, the Nissan Exterra, the two-door Ford explorer, the little Chevy Blazer, the base model Cherokee and all of the Jeeps. Secondly it has the ability to go topless. There's no better way to enjoy a great day ( or night) then having the sky right there with you.

My Amigo is a 1998 version with just about every available option. The only difficulties I have encountered have been a faulty plunger switch where the tailgate closes creating several false security alarms. Twice I have used it to tow a large double axle U-Haul trailer full of all my household goods. Once from Houston to Kansas City in the middle of winter and lastly from Kansas City to Key Largo Florida this past August. The V-6 engine gave no sign of weakness or overheating. Additionally I have added a Yakima roof rack to the small portion of hard-top area. This device works great for everything from ladders to plywood sheeting to sea kayaks. 

Probably my only real gripes would be concerning the difficulty in stowing and assembling the convertible top. A lone operator would be hard pressed to get everything buttoned-up in less than eight minutes. Believe me that is a long eight minutes when it's raining cats and dogs. So you find yourself a little timid to lowering it when weather may be a factor. Also there is not really room to stow the side windows and the sun roof top when your carrying alot of people or gear. My other grip would be the swing-out tailgate versus one that lowers (like on a pickup truck). It would be better if the tailgate went down conventionally.

The Amigo is a lot of fun to drive and likes to be driven hard. I have accelerated to well over 100 MPH  when passing a line of vehicles and did not even realize it until looking at the speedometer. Off road it is very stable due to the wide track and good tires.

I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who likes to go fast, tow things, drive off the beaten path and have fun.<br><br>
