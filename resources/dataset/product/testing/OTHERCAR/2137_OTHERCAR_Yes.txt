            Golf GLS-4-door-sunroof (snrf)-manual-monsoon stereo-6 CD changer. 

Beautiful blue dash lights. One-up, one-down power windows. Back and front 
seat dome lights. Microchip ignition, fold-away sideview mirrors, front and side impact airbags, slow-release roof handles...(read more about STANDARD features at the bottom) 

These are just some of the extraordinarily well-designed &quot;standard&quot; features that come in VW's &quot;low-end&quot; model. While the Golf is priced higher than most of its direct competitors (i.e. Honda Civic), VW won't charge you for piddling things like floor mats and it is clear that the VW engineers have put a lot of lovin' into the design of this sporty little Let's Go car. 

The luxury features are just as impressive. The snrf has a one-touch adjustment dial so you don't have to hold your finger down to adjust it while trying to steer and shift gears at the same time. 3 preset positions make it easy for the indecisive, including one optimized for aerodynamics and cabin pressure/noise. The Monsoon Stereo add-on is well worth the money. Brain-pumpin' bass. The audio interface is easy to use, spare and elegant. All the buttons perform triple duty for radio, tape and CD.     

As for driving, it shifts like a dream. You never have to guess what gear you're in. It zips along just fine, and as long as you go manual, you won't be struggling up those hills and you'll be coasting down the other side.

Finally most importantly, VW's greatest accomplishment was to actually make a hatchback that wasn't butt ugly. 

Complaints: the cupholders are only big enough to hold a soda can. But they hug them with love. It's a surmountable obstacle. The glove compartment is a little small, but enormous side door pockets make up for it. Oh, and the cloth interior picks up blue lint like you wouldn't believe.

Worst of all, the Golf is in high demand, so you might have to pay a little extra to get it right away. It's best if you can tell the dealer to screw off and call you back in a few weeks when all the people he claims are pounding down his door still haven't bought his Golf. Or better yet, just order it online and wait 4-6 weeks for delivery and avoid getting you and your wallet massaged and caressed by the dealer altogether.


If you're trying to choose between a souped-up low-end car and a stripped down-middle-range car, go for the Golf. It's not the sexiest car on the market, but it drives great and will treat you like the Mac Daddy that you are.

More Standard Features

A dome light immediately turns on when you open the mirror on the back of the sun visor. The platform that covers the hatch trunk is attached to the hatch via two recoiling bungee cords that disappear into the platform when you release it from the hatch! The trunk walls have been squared off so that you get a nice neat space..no more fitting stuff around wheel humps. The back seats fold away completely flat, increasing trunk space by 75%. VW even made holes on the back of the backseats so that you can stick the back seat headrests somewhere when you've got the back seats folded down. The wheel telescopes. But wait, there's more. For everyone who has been avoiding power windows...you can still close the windows/snrf after the ignition has been turned off...as long as a door hasn't been opened. But even if you've past the point of no return, a flick of the wrist with the key in the driver's side lock will close all open windows/snrf.
