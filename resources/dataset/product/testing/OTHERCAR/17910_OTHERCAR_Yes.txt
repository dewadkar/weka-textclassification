            I found that my Mountaineer has a much better ride than its Ford explorer counterparts.  It has a better suspension and more sound-deadening under the hood.  There is a quality about this particular vehicle that makes it like an old glove.  I will be driving this until it dies and wouldn't trade it for anything.  

I bought it originally based on the testimony of good friends that have owned reliable Ford trucks for 10-12 years. If you want a classic vehicle that is not going to be out of style in a week; a car that will grow with you...own a Mountaineer.  Car and Driver magazine also rates it highly and described something similar to this unique quality I described, which makes it a superior vehicle.

I have owned mine for two years, and other than standard maintenance, it has given me no problems.  Mine is all-wheel, and the comfort of that in uncertain road conditions has made all the difference...<br><br>
