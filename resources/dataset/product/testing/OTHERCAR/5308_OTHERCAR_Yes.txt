            I had purchased a Honda Accord several years ago.  It was a 1986 model, four years old at the time.  My only two complaints at that time with that model was the seats were uncomfortable, and the air conditioning was about effective as someone blowing on me.  Both were sore points living in Dallas, Texas with a 45 minute commute.  

When it came time to purchase another vehicle, I kept those grievances in mind as I took a test drive.  I was very pleased to discover that the Honda engineers have answered my complaints.  

The seats were as comfortable as one can expect for a mid-priced sedan, but the air conditioning is superb.  Even on 100 degree days, I rarely run the air at full blast.  Mostly I alternate between the lowest setting and off.

The Accord has good pickup, although when backing up while in reverse, I notice the gas pedal sticks a bit, which causes me to lurch backwards if I'm not careful.  

I run between 32 and 35 miles per gallon, which is a help during these times of rising gas prices.  You won't hear complaints about the price of gas out of me.  A full tank costs less than 15 bucks and lasts me over a week.

I bought it six months ago and it was two years old at the time.  Since then I have not put one dollar into maintenance for this vehicle except for oil.  I wish I could say the same for my wife's Ford Contour.  <br><br>
