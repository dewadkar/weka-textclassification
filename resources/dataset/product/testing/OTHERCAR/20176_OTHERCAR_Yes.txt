            This little car is simply a fantastic value for the buck. My wife and I have driven across the country twice in it, and have been completely comfortable. It has a reasonable amount of interior space for its' class and can easily fit two car seats in the rear seats, for young families.

 The trunk space is adequate for a lot of groceries, or if going on a short trip, a suitcase or two. The cup holders are nicely located. The crumple zones are well designed, and Suzuki is well known for its' reliability. I would recommend rotating the tires before every three thousand miles. The four wheel independent suspension is excellent in such a small car. It ran well in all weather, including reasonable amounts of snow.

 It has better than average gas mileage, and a nice aerodynamic exterior. Interior noise is moderate to high, depending on tire selection and road conditions. The stereo is adequate. The Heat/AC system is adequate. In all, this is a good little car for a new family, or the typical commute. With two front airbags and daytime running lights standard, it is pretty safe. I would recommend this car to anyone with a small family, or for the daily commute.<br><br>
