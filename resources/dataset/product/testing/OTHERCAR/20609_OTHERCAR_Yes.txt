            I purchased the A4 about 1 year ago and love it. I was car shopping for a couple months and did not enjoy it one bit, but it was worth the hassle of reading about them and test driving all the cars I was interested in because I am now completely satisfied with my decision; this car is the best car for the money. If you can afford it, it's worth it. 
I walked into the Audi dealership with someone else who was looking for a car, not planning on buying an Audi because I thought it would be too expensive. I always thought Audi's were 40 or 50 thousand dollars because they were always compared to the more expensive cars. After talking to the salesman, he explained how inexpensive it was and what a great car I get for such a good deal. 
I have not had any problems with it yet, and neither has any one else I know who has one. It handles great; every time I travel it is very quiet and smooth. They take care of all the maintenance for four years or 50,000 miles for free, even the oil changes, which saves a lot of money in the long run. It is really roomy in the front and back seats, great for a family car. Anyone could look into buying this because it is sporty and roomy for families. I would never suggest it as a first car because it is too much money to spend just to beat it up, but it's good for any parent who wants to feel safe when their children are driving. It has all wheel drive and comes more than 4 airbags,which can be good or bad, depending on your opinion. I think it is too much because I could so easily snap my neck from the impact.  
It has almost every option I wanted in a car, except the seats are not electronic, so there is no memory(which really is not that big of a deal when you consider all the other options it offers). The arm rest in the back seat comes down and has a bag that pulls out to put my skis in so my car doesn't get dirty, which is really great. The radio can be turned on whenever, even if the key is not in. I got the upgraded sound system, which is unbelievable, it is so crisp. I play it very loud all the time, and haven't even come close to blowing the speakers. It even came with a huge first aid kit with everything you'll ever need, considering I haven't even tapped into it yet. The interior is very cleverly set up, the cup holders, middle compartment, and everything in its right place. 
If you are looking to buy a good car and not spend a lot of money, the Audi A4 is what to get. <br><br>
