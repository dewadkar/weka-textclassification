            I seem to have a cavalier magnet attached to me... my first car was a 1988 cavalier Rs, which I had for over 5 years... and now my third car, is a 1993 Cavalier, 2 door, 2.2l - and I love it! I had gotten the car for free, so I couldn't resist that price, but the car is absolutly beautiful. It's fire engine red, and the paint is still as shiny as a brand new car.  The previous owner kept it well maintained, and I have continued to do so, and have had no serious problems with it... just had to do regular brake jobs, tires, oil changes, etc.  The only things I've had to replace so far were rotors, and a sensor. Other than that, rain, snow, shine, hail, it starts up everytime and has never let me down. I have since put in a cd player with some better quality speakers, window tint, and some new rims (16"x7) look great with plenty of room to spare - no rubbing!  :)  It's amazing how many compliments I get on this car, with so little modifications. When it comes out of the car wash, the whole car just gleams and shines. My 88' cav was modified totally (too long to get into) but I was 18 then and the whole Import thing was just beginning - so i pretty much made it a domestic "import"  :) (It was FAST) but this time, I just figured I'd save my money and just get a few things to spruce it up a bit.... and thats all it takes to make this car look awesome. You have to make sure you get a good cav... trust the person you buy it from. Some cav's can be nightmares, with one repair after another (which was the case w/ the 88' I owned, which is why I upgraded everything - something broke every week) but sometimes you get a real gem, like the 1993 I have now. I can't complain. Shop around, make sure it was maintained, and test it out... you'll find a good one, and you'll be very happy with it! I am!   :)
