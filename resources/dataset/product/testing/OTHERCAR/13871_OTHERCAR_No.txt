             <b>The Hyundai Excel</b> has always been a "car don't," especially during the carburated years of 1986-1990. Despite the bad rap all Hyundai products got by 1990 they still sold fairly well compared to some other cars in its class, for one reason; price. Having owned a 1989 Hyundai Excel GL, the 1994 models are loads more refined in the powertrain department than the pre 1990 models, but the 94 Excel still racks up black list points for its terrible ride, cheap materials, and its unreliable powertrain.

<b>Note:</b> Fuel injection was introduced in the Excel for 1991, this is one of the slowest economy cars to evolve to fuel injection in U.S history. Some companies will do anything to save a dollar.

<b>Note #2:</b> Please don't relate this review to newer Hyundai's. As, for example, the 2002 Accent 1.6 seems like a BMW M3 compared to these models.


<b>In 1994 the Hyundai Excel was offered in 3 trim lines.</b> The base 2 door hatch ( my tester), the GL four door sedan, and the 'so Hyundai considered sporty' GS 2 door hatch. All models come equipped with the same anemic 1.5 liter engine, rated at 81 horsepower. This engine offers it's 81 peak horsepower at 5,500 RPM and  91 lb-ft of torque at 3,000 RPM. This power is distributed to the front wheels. Transmission options include a 4-speed fully automatic transmission, and a clunky 5-speed manual gear box ( test car's transmission).

<i>Driving impressions:</i>

 Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is horrible. Despite this car being only 2,100 lbs or so, the 1.5 liter SOHC engine coupled to the 5-speed transmission made for some of the worst acceleration I have experienced with a car this late in the last century. On take-off, with the pedal the the metal, you hear engine noise from a horror film; you know, like the desperate woman who always screams when she is being attacked? Sometimes I couldn't tell whether or not I was hearing the engine on hard take-off or the muffler rattling. This car had only 68,000 miles on the odometer, yet the acceleration quality offered something I would expect from a Geo Metro Lsi 4-cylinder with 200,000 miles. 

<b>Handling</b> in the 1994 Hyundai Excel is by far this car's strongest performance attribute, and even then it's not that great. My tester did not come with power steering and tiny 13" steel rims that made for an adequate ride on the twistys for the average driver. Uninvolving and uninspiring are thoughts that will run through most anyone's mind who expects this car to be anything other than an economy car while testing those twisty back roads. 

<b>Cruising</b> in this car is jarring on bumpy road surfaces and even regular surfaces at any speed, not to mention noisy on the freeway at any speed over 50 MPH. Wind, road, and especially engine noise can be heard in the cabin at almost all times. This car, despite the advertised claim that it 'ran like new' had a rough idle, and the transmission dramatically clunked into 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gears, finally smoothing out fot 4th and 5th. The transmission would jolt me back and forth if cruising between 30-50 MPH in 4th gear, this has been quite the norm in my experience with cheap economy cars of the 1980s, but would not expect a '94 model of any sort of car to act this way, especially with such low mileage. Hills are taken almost as poorly as a 3-cylinder Sabaru Justy.  5th gear may help this car with fuel economy, but even with a down-shift into 4th, this car played hell getting me up steep inclines. Despite the rated 81 horsepower and light curb weight, this car really feels like it has a powertrain that was made for something for novelty use. 

It may sound like I'm nit picking this poor little car to death, but <b>braking</b> was also inadequate. The brake pedal felt extremely spongy and made for very difficult sudden stops. The front disc/rear drum set-up also feels like a novelty item on this car, giving the driver little confidence when approaching a stop light, etc. At times, and especially under hard braking I would find the brake pedal to pulsate so hard the steering wheel would vibrate (perhaps worn rotors, maybe not?). <b>Fuel Economy</b> is about average for a car this light, and with this size of motor. The 1.5 liter mated with the 5-speed manual gear box delivers an EPA estimated 36 MPG during freeway driving.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

The <b>interior</b> of the 1994 Hyundai Excel is almost as poorly designed as it was during its introduction in 1986. The dash has been revised giving more modern instrumentation and gauges, however this car's interior still harks back to a time when interior design was an afterthought. My tester came with no stereo, manual everything, however it did come with optional AC that was more warm than cold. The bucket seats are hard and made of cheap cloth with vyer little upper and lower body bolsters. These seats offer little support for even short trips, I could only imagine the pain drivers will feel on long road trips. The 1994 Hyundai Excel comes with no air bags. 

Room is actually good for 2 adults in front, and the hatchback design allows for good rear headroom, however leg room is almost nonexistent in the rear. Thanks to the hatch, cargo is good. There is enough room for a weeks worth of groceries for a family of 4-5, however, if you have a family of 4-5 this car is probably not what should be on your shopping list unless its used as a 2nd car or you have a family of acrobats; like my Geo Storm Wagonback, this car is very hard to get in and out of and takes some skill.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>    

The <b>exterior</b> of the 1994 Hyundai Excel remains almost the same as it did upon its introduction in 1986, however the paint has been upgraded, and so has the styling cues. Hyundai used its more modern logos on the front fascia, and there seems to be a much more modern appearance to this car than with the earlier models. The hatch looks very small, almost like  in size, of a Daewoo Lanos 2 door. The '94 Hyundai Excel is a relatively good looking vehicle, but there really isn't anything special about the design (unlike the Hyundai Accent which is quite stylish) that sets this car apart from the rest of the cheap hatchbacks of the early 90s.  

<i>Price and Reliability:</i>

 New, a base '94 hatchback went for around $8,000. Today, thanks to poor resale and a bad rap, the '94 Excel can be had for as low as  "$free" to around $2,000 at most. Reliability has been awful with these cars. The 94 models don't have as bad of a rap as pre 1991 models, however people still continue to complain. To the best of my knowledge Hyundai has done nothing to correct their mistakes for their customers who own these cars.
