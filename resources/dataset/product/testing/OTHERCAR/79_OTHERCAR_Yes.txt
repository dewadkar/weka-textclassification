The Miata grabbed my attention the moment it was introduced in the summer of 1989.  After several years of wishful thinking, I finally bought one, and I couldn't be happier.  If you're looking for pure, simple, gorgeous, well-built, convertible, smile-and-sun-on-your-face fun, this is it.  There simply isn't a car out there that delivers as much fun as it does - for the price.  The car that made the Boxster, et al. possible is not the fastest thing out there, but its light weight allows its 116-140 hp engine (depending on model year; mine is 128 hp) to get you to 60 mph in the 8-sec. range.  Opt for the manual; not only is it the closest thing you'll find to a joystick outside of an arcade, it's smooth and lets you get the most out of the car's willing engine.  Brakes are solid and while ABS is a nice option to have, the Miata's light weight doesn't necessitate it.  Grip is fantastic - the thing is like a go-kart and inspires confidence.  Miatas have compiled a truly outstanding reliability history, and aside from some annoying squeaks and rattles (and a freak water pump breakdown), mine has held up very well.  As for the interior, I find it simple and elegant - try to get the headrest speakers (pre-'99s only) if possible (all except base trim level cars should have 'em).  As for space - if you expect to carry even medium loads, think again.  But if you're considering a Miata, that's probably already crossed your mind.  Stylistically, the car is practically flawless and full of fun touches, like chrome gauge bezels through '95 and the slick door handles (pre-99).  The car is a modern classic and one that if maintained properly will provide years of smiles and trouble-free miles.  The 1999 redesign only improved upon all the positive qualities of the 1990-1997 (no '98s) models, while the 1994-1997s benefit from a stiffer structure, larger engine, brakes and fuel tank, and revised interior over the 1990-1993s.  M-editions probably hold their value slightly more through the years since there are fewer of them.  I plan to never sell my Miata, and after driving one, you'll probably feel the same way.
