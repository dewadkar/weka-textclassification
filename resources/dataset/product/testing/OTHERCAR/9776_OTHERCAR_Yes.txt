            I have had my ups and downs with my rodeo in the past three years.  We were looking at the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Nissan Pathfinder.  For the number of ammenaties and power that the Isuzu offered, it was the best deal.  

The LS came with leather and a six disc in dash CD system.  The CD system has been awesome, though it ate some CDs and required bringing the car in and putting a new unit in while sending the unit back to the manufacturer to remove the CDs.  They then sent a note back with the scratched CDs and eventually bought new ones for us.  

There have been numerous recalls on this car, which is good and bad.  Good that they are catching these things, bad that the car came with these defects.  The one big gripe I have are the squealing tires.  When I took the car in the shop and drove it with the foreman, he said if you take any rodeo on the lot out, they will all do this.  I asked him why don't they come up with a fix for it.  It is not fun driving through a parking garage and everyone looks at you because of the horrible screaching sound coming from your car.  I would understand turning at high speeds, but into a parking space.  Come on.  

Also, the right speaker was defective and vibrated a lot which was replaced under warranty.  There is a ratlling sound in the back I believed with the rear seats jostling a little bit when the car accelerates.  Other than that, the Rodeo has been great.  And the paint job and power are top notch  <br><br>
