                <b>It's quite astounding</b> how far family oriented cars have come these days, not only in performance, but in overall design. In 1989 Ford had one of the fastest 4 door family cars on the market; the discontinued Taurus SHO. While BMW and other companies had performance oriented family cars before the SHO, I feel it was the mass produced SHO, at its affordable price, that initiated the thought that affordable family cars didn't have to be so boring. Since the birth and demise of the SHO there has sprouted a perplexing number of affordable go-fast family cars on the market which can boast sub 7 second 0-60 times; example, the Nissan Altima 3.5 SE. 

<b>For the 2003 model year</b> the Nissan Altima comes in the same trim lines as last year; the base, 2.5 S, 2.5 SL, and the 3.5 SE (tester). While the 2.5 trims offer more than enough power with their standard 2.5 liter 4-banger, it's when you opt for the 3.5 SE that you get tire spinning muscle Nissan has only reserved for the Maxima/Z cars prior to the 2002 model year. The 2003 Altima 3.5 SE comes standard with a DOHC 3.5 V6 (known as the VQ V6, also found in the Infiniti G35, Nissan 350Z and Nissan Maxima). This power plant is rated at 245 horsepower (more in other cars) and  246 lb-ft of torque. Transmissions include a 5-speed manual, and a gated 4-speed fully automatic transmission (equipped in tester).


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

  With a relatively light curb weight of around 3,300 lbs and gobs of power on par, the 2003 Nissan Altima 3.5 SE moves from the light with speeds only its predecessor (2001 and earlier models) could only dream of. Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is quite impressive, even with the 4-speed fully automatic transmission. With a stab from your right foot to the gas pedal, you instantly open up the proverbial 'performance envelope,' allowing for instant acceleration that doesn't quit.  While torque steer is not too harsh, the Altima does have its slight undesirable moments while taking off from a full stop under full/almost full throttle do to tire spinning and regular FWD characteristics ( Nissan also has this problem with the Maxima and the Sentra 2.5 liter trim lines), however this car does very well with the power provided, keeping the Altima fairly composed while attempting full throttle starts. On take-off the exhaust note from the dual pipes isnt't too entertaining, but does offer a superiorly authoritative husk over the 3.0 DOHC engines in cars like the 2002 Accord and Toyota Camry. 

 Not only is the 2003 Nissan Altima an acceleration champ, but thanks to the additional sport tuned suspension it can also claim good <b>handling</b> manners. Despite the overall girth of this sedan, it handles slightly better than the smaller predecessor cars of 2001 and prior. The 2003 Altima by no means is a match for modern sports cars on twistys roads, yet it does retain very good grip (wide P215/55HR/17 tires are added), little body lean/roll, and an overall composed feel on the twistys.

<b>Cruising</b> is much more refined over both the previous generation and compared to the current generations' lesser trim lines. Through town the 2003 Altima 3.5 SE keeps the driver/occupants in a hushed environment. The suspension  helps this car stay devoid of harsh rattles and jolts, unlike some of the competition, i.e. the Ford Taurus. Also, at low speeds the transmission shifts very accurately, and matches the quality of the auto shifter in cars like the 2002 Accord and Camry, this enables the car to give excellent passing power at low speeds. On the freeway the car does almost as well, roadgrain noise is probably the majoring factor, however wind and engine noise can slightly be heard as well at speeds of around 65-75 MPH. Nissan could improve with the ride quality here, but as it stands, the Altima gives a much better ride than many other cars in this class. Hills/steep inclines at any speed are taken very well! The 3.5 offers enough power in high gear to accelerate up almost any steep hill without ever having to move the auto shifter over to '3.' The Altima 3.5 SE is one of the best hill climbers I have driven in this family car price bracket to date. The car makes absolutely no fuss whatsoever while climbing even 10% grades at 65  MPH; an excellent luxury for people who live in mountainous areas.

<b>Braking</b> is excellent. Even without ABS (which is an option), my tester came with 4-wheel disc brakes that assured excellent, smooth, and confident stops. Unlike cars like the Ford Taurus which come with rear drums as standard equipment, all Altima's come with this 4-wheel disc set-up.

<b>Note:</b> Traction control is optional. 

For a relatively small engine; a 3.5 V6, the Nissan Altima 3.5 SE receives only adequate <b>fuel economy</b>. While figures in the real world might be more than the EPA of 18/26, it still suggests a lower fuel economy numbers than much of the competition. The 2003 Honda Accord V6 has been suggested to receive over 30 MPG on the freeway. 

<i>Interior Accommodation/Interior Design:</i> 

The Interior of the 2003 Altima 3.5 SE is still, like last year, a mix of major positive and major negatives. The plastics, as with the 2002 models still feel cheap to the touch. The plastics used on the doors/door handles feel especially cheap. Despite the cheap plastics used, the car's dash fascia has a very modern touch to it, however Nissan has almost went 'borderline tacky' with the titanium accent theme. 
For 2003 it seems like the Altima has went even further with the titanium accents, as it wraps around the 3 point instrument cluster, the center dash, and the gated auto shifter. To many buyers this may seem quite fancy, I personally find an overdose of painted silver plastic to be just as tacky as too much simulated wood. 
The drivers position is good enough, enabling good vision in all directions, and good ergonomics to the HVAC controls. Easy to read instrumentation is offered as well. Nissan likes to call the instrument cluster in the 2003 Altima SE " motorcycle inspired."  
The cloth front bucket seats are comfy, but offer little bolstering to back up the SE's sporty powertrain, the same can be said about the 2003 Nissan Maxima's seating. Eight way power drivers seating is standard on the 3.5 SE, along with power everything, telescoping steering, leather wrapped steering with radio/cruise control buttons attached, AC, cruise control, 2 12 volt power outlets, 4 (2 up front, 2 rear) deep cup holders that double as storage, center console that doubles as an arm rest, outside temp display and much more; <b>WWW.Nissan.USA.com</b> has more info on all standard equipment. 
My tester came with the 'Sport Package Plus' ( almost a $3,000 option) which offered a power sunroof with a deflector shield, a 150 watt, 8 speaker, 6 disc (in dash) Bose premium sound system, that sounded excellent, especially compared to the single disc Nissan system in the 2.5 S. This Package also offers sporty visual styling cues such as side skirts and a spoiler. <b>WWW.NissanUSA.com</b> has all the info on optional equipment (This site also offers 360 degree interior views with zoom).
The Nissan Altima, like the 2003 Nissan Maxima is very roomy, actually about equally as roomy. Unlike the predecessor cars, the 2003 Nissan Altima can boast more than enough head, shoulder, and leg room in both the front and rear. 60/40 split bench rear seats are added as standard equipment. Overall, the interior design is a positive attribute offered in the Altima, Nissan just needs to work on the plastics, the seating, and perhaps lay off the titanium accents..
Storage is excellent, more than enough storage in the cabin, and in the trunk.

<b>Note:</b> Nissan says the plastics have been updated for 2003, I personally don't see or feel a difference.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

The <b>exterior</b> of the Altima, while looking a bit like the VW Passat, also has some Grand AM influences, as well as influences from many other cars on the current market. Whether or not Nissan purposely ripped these styling cues off of other companies or not, there is no denying that the Altima is one handsome family car. Unlike many family cars, the side skirts (part of the sport package), which act as small mud guards as well, actually made this car look 'more' sporty. Many family cars have these sort of 'sport' packages but do little good adding a more sporty look. The rear optional spoiler is modest and complimentary. To top off the Altima SE's good looks, it comes with large 'see through effect' flush rear and front lamps, 6-spoke 17" alloy rims, and a handsome set of dual chromed exhaust pipes.

<b>Price, Reliability, and Warranty:</b> The Altima 3.5 SE starts around $23,000, but with all options can rise to near $30,000. My tester came in at a little over 26K which came with more equipment than I would ever need in a family car. Reliability has been good so far for the 3rd generation Nissan Altima's. Judging from the 2002 models (which are the same essentially) there have been few problems, however this really doesn't say much; these cars are only going on their 2nd year in production. I forecast these cars will be reliable, except that the interior might forgo some trauma with age due to the cheap plastics. If anything does happen to your 2003 Nissan Altima, Nissan offers an adequate 3 year/36,000 miles bumper to bumper warranty and a 5 year/60,000 mile powertrain warranty.

<b>Conclusion:</b> The 2003 Nissan Altima is an attractive and go-fast fast family machine that offers good value. If it wasn't for the lack of material integrity within the cabin, the 2003 Altima 3.5 SE would have received 5 stars.
