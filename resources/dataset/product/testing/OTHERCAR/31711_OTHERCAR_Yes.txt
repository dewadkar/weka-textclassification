            To better help you understand where I'm coming from, here's a short intro as to who I am.  I am an avid car testdriver.  I've driven over 100 cars on the market ranging from Kia Rio's to Porsche Boxter S's.  I also have driven my Intrepid for 132,000 miles, so this isn't a newbie review.  Lastly, I rented a car for three months before I bought this car after comparing it to every other car in its class to it.

My 1990 Eclipse Turbo finally broke down at 195,000 miles one day and I needed to buy a new car.  I don't like to make rush decisions so I rented a car for 3 months before I finally decided on my 2000 Intrepid ES 3.2 liter with Autostick.

Some people on here have complained about how the car handles, and frankly, I don't know what they are comparing this car to.  This car handles like a charm considering its 3500 lb curb weight.  With a military g-force meter, I measured the lateral g-force of this car to be .86g's.  But that's on fresh asphalt and the car being equipped with Ultra High Performance tires.  Otherwise, the car can still pull high .70's.  But it's not all about how many g's it can pull.  It's about how the car reacts to an emergency avoidance procedure.  The car can quickly change from one lane to another and back again (as if trying to avoid road debris) at highway speeds without trouble.  The car remains very balanced and composed.

As far a braking, it leaves for a little to be desired.  Its braking distance is further than normal, but it is also a big, heavy car.  Compared with cars in its class, I'd say it's about average, nothing to brag about.  The ABS (optional) is too intrusive for my liking, but other owners that I know like it where it's at.

My 3.2 liter engine has performed flawlessly.  In fact, over the 132,000 miles, the only problems I've had with my car is that the output speed sensor on the transmission went out ($100.01 repair parts/labor for both the input and output sensors) and that the A/C belt broke ($50 to replace both belts parts/labor).  Otherwise, I've changed the tires once and have never had to do a brake job.

My case with the brakes is unique however, but the way I drive my car, I hardly mash on the brakes.  I anticipate stops so I usually don't slam on my brakes much at all.  Also, with my autostick, I tend to downshift the car to slow it down if all I need is to slow down some instead of using the brakes.  Though this isn't recommended, for a new tranny is many times more expensive than new brakes.

My Intrepid came with all the options except the sunroof and the rear spoiler.  The Auto Temperature Control feature is strange.  When you set it to a temperature, that's not the temperature of the air that's blowing but the temperature the car is trying to maintain in the cabin.  So sometimes the air will change from hot to cold if your cabin has been heated too much.  I hate that cold air blowing at me.  I often will have to turn the vents away or even turn off the heat altogether.

My Intrepid also came with the Infinity Sound System.  The system sounds great, but most owner's will notice that their center channel speaker (the one located right in the middle of the dash) will blow out.  Most of my friends think that the car has a woofer in it, but it doesn't.  It just sounds that way.

With the factory tires, the car isn't that great in the snow (I live in Minnesota).  Definitely get snow tires if you're in an area that gets a lot of snow, or else do as I do and buy All Season tires that have a lot of biting edges (similar to a snow tire).  I currently have Yokohama Avid Tourings on mine, and they are far better than the Eagles that came stock on the car.

The roominess in my car is far better than most in its class.  The in-laws own a new Bonneville (2003), and they both agree that my car is definitely roomier than a Bonneville.

As far as comfort goes, I have the automatic leather seats and they are extremely comfortable for long trips.  As you can tell by my 132,000 miles, I've taken plenty of long trips.  There is no driver fatigue from the seats at all.  Also, these power seats recline almost to a flat position, which makes it a very comfortable car to sleep in, if you must.

My car also has the dual fold-down rear seats so it's really nice to pass through long objects.  The car can accommodate 10 foot long objects and still be able to close the trunk (I've done this many times with 2x4's and mouldings.  Another bonus of this is for you audiophiles out there, your subwoofers can fire directly into the cabin which makes for a really loud stereo system.

Another nice thing about this car is that the car is similar to the 300M so you can interchange parts between the cars.  The 300M has a better overhead computer that can be directly replaced.  You can also replace the lightswitch too for automatic headlights.  For us more experienced guys, I just took my existing headlight switch apart and file down the little plastic stop on my switch and now I have automatic headlights, which means that when it gets dark, the lights automatically turn on and when it gets light out, they turn off.  Another good thing about this is that when you have your wipers on for over 8 seconds (8 seconds so as to avoid them coming when when you're just cleaning the windshield), the lights automatically turn on, which you should have them on anyways if you are in conditions where you need your wipers.

On pure highway with the cruise control set to 75 mph, I can average 30 miles a gallon, which isn't half bad for this size car with 222 HP and 225 lb/ft of torque.

Overall, I've been very happy with this car.  It has been very trouble free and very solid.  There is no hint of troubles at all at 132,000 miles (knock on wood) and I fully expect this car to surpass 200,000 miles.  Also at the risk of exposing myself, I really don't take care of this car like I should.  I often let the car go way past 3000 miles before oil changes, but from what I've read from experts, it's ok especially if most of the miles are from highway miles.  Just as long as I change it every 3 months, which sometimes it meant changing the oil after 12,000 miles.  I've also never had a tune-up and some other recommended services.  Not that I'm bragging, but just as a testament to how well this car is built.  I wouldn't recommend that everyone does this.  My car is mostly highway driven.

Hope that helped somewhat, but if anyone ever had any more thoughts or questions, there is a forum that has been very helpful to me and their address is http://www.dodgeintrepid.net

A definite buy!
