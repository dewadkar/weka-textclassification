            I am a lifelong Nikon fan.  So, I had a difficult time deciding to purchase the Sony Mavica FD83 over the Nikon Cool Pix, but I closed my eyes and did it.  Boy, am I glad that I did!  I was convinced to do so for a couple of reasons:  1.) the Sony Mavica uses plain, old floppy disks, which means easy to store; easy to file; easy to give copies to friends, family and clients; inexpensive, 2.) easier to learn to use-the Nikon is very complicated and there is really quite a time investment to get up to speed on it, while the Mavica was, relatively, point and shoot (in comparison), 3) PRICE- I was able to negotiate a really great price at $450 for the Sony vs. $749 for the Nikon.
I use the camera for real estate.  It saves time when I want to use it to take photos for flyers, or to give to computer active clients who want to go out and see houses.  For a long time, I took a Polaroid and film and gave the potential purchaser the camera and film--which cost me a fortune.  Now, I can hand them the digital camera and floppies and I save money, while the photos are much better.  
Family events are even great because we can copy photos onto disks and give them out.  This past holiday, my 5 year old nephew was taking great photos with just a little coaching.  So, it really is easy.
Took me a bit of time to figure out the balance between exposure and flash, but I'm figuring it out.
ONE BIG THING: Tech Support-I called the phone number and it was a DIRECT LINE to a Mavica tech who helped me RIGHT AWAY.  I have never called any tech support number without being put on hold nor have I ever been connected directly to the proper person.<br><br>
