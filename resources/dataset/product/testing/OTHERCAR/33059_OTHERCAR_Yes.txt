            In October of 1993 I wandered into a Champion Mitsubishi dealer in Palm Springs, CA while I was waiting for the bus to take me home.  Being freshly (that previous July) discharged out of the USMC and having no personal transportation I was in the market for a vehicle.  Let�s be honest here, the <I>main</I> reason I went to the Mitsubishi dealer was this: they had a big, painted window that said, �$1500 REBATE�.  Now who can turn that down while waiting to ride the bus, eh?  Long-painful-dealership-story short I drove out of there four hours later in a 1994 brand new, red, 4x2, standard cab, 5-speed, 4-cylinder Mitsubishi Mighty Max Pick-Up.  Little did I know for the next six and a half years this would be my dream truck.

I was working in the furniture industry at the time, which basically meant that if it was furniture...I moved it.  Now that I�d acquired a truck I was able to make money on the side doing deliveries after store hours (I worked for the local La-Z-Boy store).  I also, with a former Marine buddy that lived in the Coachella Valley as well, did jobs moving people from one place to another.  I put my Mitsubishi truck through intense paces in April of �94 when we moved a couple from Palm Springs, CA to Olympia, WA.  We drove a 27� Ryder rental truck and my Mighty Max.  My truck, however, proved its worth by hauling, for the entire trip, 2500 pounds of Mexican floor tiles.  Rated as a � ton truck, the only one in its class by the way, my Mitsubishi performed phenomenally!  It handled like a dream the entire trip!  This was just the first proving ground for this vehicle.

Over the next six and a half years I hauled, well, if you can think of it I�ve probably hauled it.  An exaggeration, true, but nearly accurate.  Performance across the board was fantastic!  For a year and a half I delivered auto parts in that truck putting between 3000-5000 miles <I>a month</I> on it with nary a complaint!  Just this last February my truck was ripped from me in a head on collision caused by, ironically, a tow truck that failed to yield to my green light.  I escaped with only a broken tooth and the usual joys of intense whiplash.  My beautiful red, wonderfully performing Mitsubishi Mighty Max Pick-Up wasn�t so lucky.  She was totaled.  I was heartbroken.  From October 1993 to February 2001 I had rolled up 145,876 miles on that workhorse of a truck and had planned to take her to 200,000 on the original engine!

My only complaint and it is the <B>only</B> one is this: the air conditioning compressor blew out after only two years of use.  Mind you I was in Palm Springs, CA in the heart of the Mojave Desert with temperatures in the summer topping 115 degrees.  However, I would have liked the compressor to last longer.  

At her demise, my Mitsubishi still had its original starter, transmission, muffler, undercarriage, alternator and engine.  In fact, the only major part that had to be replaced was the fuel pump in early 2000.  After 145K plus miles, she still purred like a kitten.  I cannot say enough good things about the Mitsubishi Mighty Max Pick-Up.  It saddens me that Mitsubishi does not import them any longer.  

If you are looking for a used compact pick-up do yourself a favor and check out the Mitsubishi Mighty Max.  You won�t be disappointed.
