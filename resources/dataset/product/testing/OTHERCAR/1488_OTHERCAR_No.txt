    Flush with a buyout check delivered at the end of 1995 and determined to buy another car quickly so I could give my previous car to charity, and hating, absolutely hating, the whole negotiating process involved in buying a car, I decided to try a 1996 Saturn SL.

    I have mixed feelings about this car, and have from nearly the beginning. Yes, Saturn makes the purchase much easier. You have X number of choices, just a few options unless you want to go to a different model, and a very set price. I much prefer buying a car this way, though the fact that I was walking around with a big bundle of cash should have made me realize that I could have gotten a good deal. I should have acted like a grownup and been prepared to deal, but the reality is, I don't. So, hooray for Saturn and its practices. I'm glad they have stuck with it. Even the goofy little party you get where all the salespeople gather round and cheer and take your picture when you pick up the car are nice little touches. 

  Overall, the car is very nice looking; I still get compliments on it. It handles well, the mileage is fine. The antilock brakes are pretty noisy, but not awful.
 
   But the problems I have with the car are pretty extensive:

  The dashboard is extremely deep-I can't see over the dashboard and out to the hood of my car. I can't see the front end of my car, which made me very nervous initially. I like to see where the car starts, where the car is, actually, so that in driving into a parking space, for example, I can see how close I am to the curb. In traffic, of course,  I can see the car in front of me, so on the road, this design isn't a problem. But in parking, it is. I've tried adding a seat cushion, but all that does is elevate me just enough to bang my knees on the steering column.

  Something is amiss with this car. 

1. Brand new, the overhead light wouldn't go off. Three trips to the fairly distant dealership were necessary before they could figure out that there was an electrical short.

2.   The backseat is supposed to drop down to allow the carrying of big items to extend from the trunk into the backseat. It no longer drops down. When I got the car, the two backseat cushions were not aligned properly. So I asked them to fix it. The repairmen determined that the latch was broken, replaced it and sealed the latch shut.

3.  Twice in less than a year (and still new) I've had to replace the same brake/taillight unit. 

4. The antenna is loose; I screw it back into place about once a week but it comes loose regularly. This may be made worse by the fact that the windshield wiper, on high speed, hits it on each swipe, though it comes loose even when I haven't been using the wipers for quite a while.

5. Some sort of lining crept up from between the dashboard and the frame, a string of black cloth of some sort sticks out of the dash.

6. The rubber lining around the driver's store will not stay on, so when it rains, I get water in the car. I had the original dealership fix this, though later discovered that their idea of fixing it was to just stick it back on  (that's how they fixed the antenna, too, I suspect, simply screwed it back into place.)

7. One wheelbase was utterly rusted out less than four years after I bought it. The second Saturn dealership was sure the car must have been parked in a pool of water for quite a while. I said no, I didn't keep pools of water in my garage. But the mechanic thought the car had been exposed to a flood of some sort. 


   All of this makes me suspicious, of course. Not long ago, I saw a TV program about cars that had been damaged by accident or water but rebuilt and sold as new. That the second dealership was unable to find records of the sale of my car through the Saturn network makes me additionally concerned.

  If I had lots of time on my hands, I would pursue all these matters, but instead, I've simply gotten them repaired. So, my advice is, you might want to buy from Saturn if you despise negotiating or feel you won't get the best deal that way. But if you find the slightest problem, get it fixed and documented immediately. Don't wait until it's too late.  

This is a very overdue entry into the car writeoff to benefit the family of the late Roadiem, who wrote wonderful pieces about cars.  My apologies, I"ve been recovering from  surgery and overestimated my ability to bounce back.
