            Fabulous!!!!!!! We ventured into the digital camera world armed with only the info of well meaning friends and thought for sure we would be swallowed alive! NOT! This camera found us.....on sale for 299.95 @ Target it comes with a &quot;smartmedia&quot; card and is the easiest thing to work! Point and shoot....there it is. The pictures can then be projected onto your TV,computer or you can just preview them through the LCD screen.  I am thrilled with this camera and would recommend it highly to both the novice (Pick me Monty!) and the semi-pro.....anyone know any?! Try it; you will be pleasasntly surprised!<br><br>
