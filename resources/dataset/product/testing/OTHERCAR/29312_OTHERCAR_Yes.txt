            This truck, or APV (All Purpose Vehicle) as it was known as back then (now SUV) because of marketing reasons, and we all know there is only one purpose for SUV's: taking the kids to soccer practice! haha

I own a Jeep Wrangler, and have no kids, so please don't be offended, because I'm the same way as all of us are that love size, looks, and power!!!

I got this truck from my parents who bought it brand new in 1990 with the Silverado package (basically every option available at the time, including A/C and power windows and locks!), and I say REAL Silverado in my heading, because now all the new pickup trucks from Chevy are called Silverado, a basic generic-ification of an old GREAT name in trucks (cars fall victim to this too: Impala, 300M, Thunderbird, Cougar, Malibu, etc...) When they take a REALLY good old name, and make it generic fr a so-so vehicle just to sell more. ut it works, so we're the only ones to blame!

Anyway, this is a TRUCK. It's got a 350 engine, overdrive 4 speed automatic transmission, 4x4 (on the floor, not a stupid button that all the new ones have, except Dodge and Jeeps, they stil lhave a lever, thank GOD!!!), Silverado package, around 185,000 miles on it, and yes, the sliding rear glass window, which is the best feature on an APV or SUV that is no longer in existance other than on the Toyota 4 Ruin-er. 

The truck itself I totally Love. I've been driving it for about 6 or 7 years now, all through high school and college, and still have it on the road today. It's rides like an old SUV, but like all things, it grows on you, and after driving this for a while, I can't wait to get into my 2000 Mustang (see review on that too!), so it all evens out! The power is unreal, the transmission is great, and it wouldn't notice if you loaded the back with kids or equipment. It just goes!!! With a truck this old, it's expected that it will need some repair work, and this truck is part of the, and BY FAR, easiest to repair line of trucks in the world! It's based on the same Chassis that ALL Chevrolet pickup trucks used for about 15 years + or - (yes, even up until the 1999 changeover for all you Tahoe and Suburban owners that thought their 1998 was new! haha) I think if you went to any auto parts store, and told them you wanted to build the chassis, engine, and tranny for this line of trucks, they could do it, and all affordably. The fixes that have to be done are simple: alternator, brakes, tie-rods, etc...but I've had to change the things about 1 time each on this. I've done it myself with my Dad, so labor wasn't anything, but the parts are all dirt cheap either from a junk yard, or parts store. Just don't buy from dealer when the vehicle is this old, it's waste of money!

What I hate: well, it's not really hatred, but the gas mileage is dog awful!!! About 13-15 MPG no matter what. Highway or City driving doesn't matter! :-) I guess that's about it. My wife doesn't like it, but she doesn't drive it!!!

Who should buy this. A truck this old? Probably a rare case of a hunter or farmer looking for a good utility truck to rebuild, and cruise around the fields in. Don't take that the wrong way though, because I'd buy a new Tahoe (Blazer replacement name when they got the 4 door option) any day of the week, and that will truly probably be my next vehicle, if not a Denali or Escalade (same as Tahoe and Yukon).

Who shouldn't: anyone who says this, &quot;Why would you want an SUV? All they do is hurt people when you hit them, and hog gas.&quot; If you say that, then don't buy this! This is, as previously mentioned, an APV, not an SUV. There is nothing sporty about this, it is a truck. Not a truck on a car body. PLEASE understand this, even the new SUV's just aren't made like this. It rides bad, gets bad gas mileage, and it's not a kid picker-upper-from-practice-or-mall<br><br>
