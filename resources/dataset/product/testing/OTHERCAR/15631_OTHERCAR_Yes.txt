            I purchased a Sony MVC-FD91 digital camera after researching the many alternatives available.  It can get confusing to make the choice unless you have a good idea of what you want to do with the camera.  After owning the MVC-FD91 for several months, I feel like it was a pretty good pick.  Here's why:

Convenience:  The Mavica series of digital cameras put the pictures and movies onto floppy disks in standard JPEG and MPEG formats--the media and the formats are universal and require no additional hardware to transfer the information into a computer.  Great for sharing with others, too.

Versatility:  The MVC-FD91 can take short digital movies (MPEG format) in addition to still photographs.  The features, such as 14x optical zoom, &quot;steady shot&quot;, and the exposure controls, allow quite a bit of flexibility.  Having an eyepiece in addition to an LCD is a plus, and the menu system is easy to use.

Reliability:  I own many Sony products, and I have never had a Sony product fail on me.  This camera is no exception...yet.

The camera is rather large compared to alternatives, and it is not as easy as many others to carry around for that reason.  I purchased the special carrying case when I bought the camera...I wouldn't do that again--it's certainly not worth the money.  Also, the resolution of the pictures is not as good as many other cameras which cost less.  If you are after the highest resolution and the richest colors for the money, don't get a Sony Mavica--you may want to buy a Kodak model, for example, which takes some excellent pictures (my dad owns one) and costs much less.  I was after a versatile camera which would allow me to take pictures and short movies to send over the Internet to dispersed family members, and it's not very time-efficient to send high-resolution pictures over the Internet without a high-speed connection, so why bother with a high-resolution camera?<br><br>
