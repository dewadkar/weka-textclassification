            I decided on purchasing a Cavalier after a long time of comparison-shopping among many different makes and models.  I purchased it new in '96 and have had almost no problems with it since.  My car does not consume much gas, it is roomy enough, the breaks have never been a problem, nor has anything else for that matter.
It's a good value as well and it rides smoothly.  Since January '96, I have only had one problem with the car and even that had to do with windshield wipers.
If you are looking for a nice sedan non-luxury car, I say go for the Cavalier.  It has served me very well.<br><br>
