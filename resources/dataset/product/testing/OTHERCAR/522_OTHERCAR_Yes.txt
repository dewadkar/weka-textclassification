            I purchased this camera primarily for the fantastic image stabilized zoom but found so much more that I can also sing accolades about it's ease of use and exceptional photo quality.  The camera has so many  direct access buttons to commonly used functions, that few visits to the menu are necessary.  When the menu  is necessary it is simple to scroll through the choices and to finalize choices by hitting the &quot; OK &quot; button.  I very much like: the quick start up of this camera, the rapid fire capability, bracketing, the strong flash,the fit and finish of this camera, and the ability to use some of the filters I had collected for my 35mm film cameras.
    The resolution of the captured photos are excellent even in the telephoto mode. I have no complaints about this camera and if you want an extremely functional camera as well as an attractive camera, this is the one you will carry with you to the exclusion of some of your other cameras.
