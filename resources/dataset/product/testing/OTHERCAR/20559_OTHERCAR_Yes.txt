            My parents bought me this car when I graduated college.  I have had the car a little over a year now, and it has been wonderful. The car has not had any major problems yet, and I love that. I have taken the car on many long road trips, and it has held up fine.

I have the automatic version of the car, and I don't have the fast version, so my car is not a speed demon at all, but it has adequate acceleration for me.  I also love the styling of the car.  It looks like a little sports car.

The two front passenger seats are very comfortable, but if an adult has to sit in the back seat they are usually very cramped.  The truck space is what you would expect from this small of a car.  It is not great, but it can hold weekend luggage for two. 

I love that my car came with a CD player, but the sound system as a whole should be better.  I think that part of the reason the stereo does not sound great is because the car makes too much noise at high speeds.  

Overall though this has been a very reliable car that has served me well.<br><br>
