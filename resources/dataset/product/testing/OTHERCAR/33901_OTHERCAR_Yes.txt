                 I bought my 1994 nissan pick-up last year with 54,000 miles on it. At first glance i was not really impressed with the little truck, it has a different looking front end witch compares to no other truck i looked at. The sales person ( a friend of the family) gave me the truck for an overnight test drive. 
     Before i go into that ill give you some background on the truck it was a bone stock the base line model with only three extras, Sliding window, rear bumper and auto transmission. The engine is the nissan 2.4 4 cyl.(same engine in the 240sx), witch is rather large when compared to most other import 4 cylinders. My research shows that it had the highest horsepower and torque for 4 cylinder trucks that year (I don't have the numbers for the numbers for the toyota at this time). 
    Back to the test drive, as I lift the parking lot of the dealership i realized that it had more then a little pep, it had &quot;balls&quot;. It had quick acceleration and had no problem reaching the top speed marked on the speedometer. The more I looked at the truck the more it grew on me the lines were clean and the distinct front end gave it personality. I did notice some problems with the truck there was lots of road noise (I figure since it is the base line they skimped on insulation), There was an odd poping noise when i tried to make sharp turns and the interior lacked style (not counting the dash and instrument panels). The poping sound was fixed by the dealership before I bought, it turned out to be a common problem caused by lack of lubrication on the torsion bars.
     A little less then a year later I am still very happy with the truck witch now has a little over 60,000 miles on it. i would recommend this truck to any one looking for a compact truck. It also makes a great platform for performance and styling upgrades.<br><br>
