I am constantly teased by friends that I am the most thorough consumer they know, so it wasn't unusual when I spent about a month comparing digital camera reviews before buying this camera. (Great reviews can also be found on photographyreview.com and dpreview.com). My criteria for buying a digital camera were that it be a compact 3 megapixel, have a good zoom, have the capability of being manual or automatic, and that it have GREAT image quality. This camera has it all.
I took a huge risk using this camera for the first time on a trip to London in February. (I also purchased a 128MB CompactFlash card and extra battery---a necessity). I read the manual on the plane, and set off to take pictures. I took 140 pictures on the 128MB card at highest resolution--even deleted several pictures to fit more.

I got home a week later, anxious to see whether the photographs would be a cause to celebrate or to auction the camera on E-bay. I printed the photos myself on a photo printer (more on that later), and they looked like postcards.... the color was awesome, the images were sharp---I was sorry that I didn't take more CompacFlash cards with me!

I printed the pics on the Hewlett Packard Photosmart 100, which is a miniscule, portable printer that will print directly from CompacFlash and other media cards (without being connected to a computer)--see reviews on amazon[.com]. The printing quality is amazing, and I now travel with it so I can print my pictures while on vacation.
