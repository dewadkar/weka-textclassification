            Whilst considering which camera to upgrade to from my Canon G1, I borrowed my friend's Fuji 6900Z for a week to "test drive". The following is my experience with the camera. I would not dwell into the technical details as these are freely available elsewhere on the net. I write this article from a ordinary user's perspective.

<B>Design</b>

I love the look of this camera. It looks like an SLR. It is dark gray. It has the presence of a pro camera. Holding it, I find it very comfortable. The hand grip is huge and really gives you a good and stable grip.

The buttons and controls seem to be randomly spread across the body of the camera though. For example, the flash mode button is located on top near the shutter release button. The usual place for this, IMHO, should be at the back of the camera, where all the other buttons are. The white balance button is located on the lens barrel! These arrangements make is tedious for someone unfamiliar with the camera to hunt around for the controls.

I like the fact that the zoom controls are located both at the back of the camera as well as on the lens barrel though. I find it more intuitive to control the zoom with the left hand.

The pop up flash is also a nice touch. It is neatly tucked away until needed. It also comes with a hotshoe for external flash.

The other nice feature is the manual focus ring. It is a "fly by wire" type, ie the camera determines the distance by the amount the ring is turned. Again, this is very intuitive, much better than that on the Canon G1 and G2.

Nowadays, a lot of manufacturers are coming up with designs that allow you to view the LCD from various angles. Take Nikon for example. Their latest Coolpix 5000 has the same swivelling LCD screen like the G1 and G2. I think this adds a lot of flexibility to the composition of the picture. Unfortunately, this flexibility is not available on the 6900.

The camera doesn't come with an optical view finder. Instead, it comes with an Electronic View Finder (EVF). I personally never liked EVFs. They are basically miniature versions of the LCD screens. The resolution is low and the frame coverage is typically low. Looking through the EVF of the 6900, I see lots of LCD cells. The resolution is low and I can't really be sure of whether the focus is good or not. I'd much rather use the LCD screen for composition instead.

The camera is surprisingly light. I guess this has got to do with the fact that most of the body is covered in plastic and the battery is rather small. This lightness may be a pro to some but con to others. Personally, I prefer my camera to have a certain weight. The weight adds to the stability. I find the camera a little too plasticky.


<B>In Use</b>

The 6900 uses the Fujifilm's by now famous Super CCD. The CCD is basically a 3 megapixel variety but due to the unique layout of the sensors and through some sophisticated in-camera interpolation, it produces a 6 megapixel picture. 

You can opt to take pictures in 3MP, 2MP, 1MP & VGA modes as well, to save storage space. This is important especially if you are travelling, unless you have loads of SM Cards with you. Currently the largest SM Card capacity is only 128MB.

The lens has an incredible 6X optical zoom capability. This is twice the power of a typical digital camera in this range. Despite this long focal length, it has managed to be a pretty "fast" lens, with f-stop of 2.8. The image stabiliser really works. I find that I can take hand-held indoor shots with low light without hardly any camera shake.

One big gripe I have about the camera is the size of the icons/ words that appear in the LCD screen. They are just way too small. Often times, I find myself squinting real hard to make out the words/ icons displayed.

It takes movies without audio input. That is a little outdated as all the new digicams seem to have the audio capture ability.

After taking pictures for about 1 1/2 hours, my fully charged battery was almost drained. I find this time a little too short. With the G1, it would have taken at least 3 hours to drain a newly charged battery.

Also, I find the battery compartment (located inside the hand grip) very hot by the time I finished my session. Most digicams do get hot in use but I think this one is a little hotter than the usual.

On the whole I find the camera quite fast in operation, ie, I can hardly feel the usual lag that most digicams have from the time you press the shutter release to the picture actually being taken.

<B>Picture Quality</b>

At the end of the day, the most important role of a camera is surely to produce good pictures. And that the 6900 does with aplomb.

So despite all my unhappiness about its other features as stated above, I have to admit that this camera takes very good pictures. They are typically high resolution and sharp pictures with very vivid colors. This is so even for indoor shots without flash. I am indeed very impressed.

The built-in flash works well too. I have taken very impressive indoor shots with the built-in flash. They don't have that overexposed look that some built-in flash can produce.

<B>Summary</b>

The 6900 is not perfect. It has many shortfalls. But then, no camera is perfect. Choosing a digicam is a process of weighing the pros & cons and deciding what features are most important to you.

If image quality is utmost in your priority list, this could well be the camera for you. On the other hand, if flexibility, functions, battery life, ability to use microdrives are important considerations for you, then you should look elsewhere.

Suffice to say, I chose the Canon G2 in the end.
