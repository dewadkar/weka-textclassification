            I've had my 2001 Clover Green Civic 2 door LX since the begining of September and couldn't be more happy.  The LX comes loaded with power windows and doors, a/c, single CD, cruise control and power mirrors.  I also got the windows tinted and a rear spoiler.  Stunning.  I also added a hood deflector - to avoid the inevitable stone chips on the hood.

The car drives like a dream, handles corners like I've never seen - virtually no body roll - and provides a comfortable ride.  Although the ride is a bit stiffer than some other small cars.  The gas mileage on this car is unreal.  On a 50 litre tank (approx. 13 gallons) it travels 650 kilometres (or 400 miles).  AMAZING!  Especially with the price of gas at 70 cents a litre!  

Cargo space is amazing.  The trunk is huge and since the rear seats fold down it gets bigger before your eyes.  The rear seating has a surprising amount of leg and head room as well.  A 6' person in the back seat can be quite comfortable - although I can't see 3 adults sitting back there at the same time.

Honda also has a security feature in their keys.  A chip in the key must be present for the engine to be started.  Just gives some peace of mind.  Although the replacement cost for the keys hurts a bit.

I realize the car is only 2 months old, but I feel confidant this car will last me 10 years.  I recommend it without hesitation.
