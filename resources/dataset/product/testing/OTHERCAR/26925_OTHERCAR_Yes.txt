            Why the Toyota Camry? Well if you want a dependable car with great gas milage and a great ride at a reasonable price then it is the car for you. I bought a camry for my daughter two years ago and she has 90,000+ miles on it and itruns like a charm. I change the oil every 3,000 miles and that is the only visit to the shop that I had to take. I own a 4Runnner a Lexus and a Tundra and have yet to have a problem with any of these toyota products. The camry has a V4 but has astonishingly good pick up and an abundance of top end speed. I was amaze that puting over ninty thousand miles on a car in two years did not cause any problems with the engine. I feel that the camry is one of the most dependable cars on the market and comes at a reasonable price.<br><br>
