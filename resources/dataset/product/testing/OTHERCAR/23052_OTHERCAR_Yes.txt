            I have several cameras but needed one for the computer.  Being short on patience and low on cash, I grabbed a little money and headed to the nearest discount store.  I could've held out and saved for a high dollar, high performance model, but I didn't.  The PDC640 was the only one in my price range so there was no comparison shopping.  

Contrary to the old adage, you don't get what you pay for if you buy this camera.  It's not superb (resolution is only 640x480) but it's a dependable unit that is pretty easy to use.  It takes great pictures, particularly outdoors.  The red-eye feature works wonderfully.  Looking through the optical viewfinder isn't real pleasant as the green &quot;ready&quot; light is in your field of vision.  Distracting until you get used to it.  With the push of a button, you can use the LCD viewfinder instead although this drains the batteries quickly.  The installation CD wouldn't work for me so I called tech support expecting to get the runaround. They were very helpful, got me the correct drivers and sent me a new CD for good measure.  Once I got the software installed, downloading the images from the memory card was a piece of cake.

If you are looking for a digital camera but don't want to shell out the big bucks, or if you're like me and can't wait until the money is saved up, then this is the camera for you.<br><br>
