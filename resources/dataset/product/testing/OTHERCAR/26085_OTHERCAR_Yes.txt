            I recently purchased my second Mazda Protege.  I bought my first one in 1995 and loved the car...it handled like a big car, had plenty of room and got great mileage.  I loaded it down with a ton of stuff and drove it from Tennessee to Utah and back and that little car drove like a dream the whole way. I was amazed at everything I managed to cram in the car and even more amazed at how it charged up those mountain roads without hesitation, even though it was loaded to the gills. My roommate also drove this car and liked it so much, she bought one herself!
      In 1999, I decided to trade up from my '95 DX to a '99 ES and I still LOVE Proteges.  I've put nearly 10,000 miles on it since I got it in August and it's been a dream car.  I always forget that I'm driving a little car...it has good get-up-and-go, rides like a big car, gets fantastic mileage and the interior is roomy and comfortable.  The trunk space is great, the sound system is good and the car practically drives itself.  I'd suggest this car to anyone looking for great car on a low budget.<br><br>
