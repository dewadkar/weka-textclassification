            I LOVE this camera. This is our first digital camera and it is soooo easy to use. The instruction book isn't as thick as the dictionary like the one that came with our camcorder. 
It has simple buttons on the top and a nice clear LCD screen on back that lets you preview your pictures. 
It takes wonderful pictures, very clear. And it is very simple to remove them from the camera, one cord to the back of the computer and it comes with a simple driver that can be used with any graphics program (I prefer paint shop pro) to retrieve and edit the pictures, but it does come with a graphics program also.
It stores all the images on a media storage card and you may purchase extras if you would be going somewhere you would need lots of pictures before you could get to your computer.
And the price is good I think, $379 for a 1.5 megapixel.
I HIGHLY recommend it=)
