            I was in love with my new Neon when we purchased it in March 2000.  It had the feel of a mid-class car and we chose the ES model which included all the bells and whistles.  When deciding on a new car purchase we had read the reviews about the new Neons and how they had improved over the previous years models as far as cabin noise, cabin room, options, overall look, etc.  We agreed and brought one home.  I have been please with my Neon other that the fact that in just the few months that we have owned it the cabin noise has increased.  Early on everything was tight and sound proof but for a short time and then things loosened up and now I hear engine noise, wind, and road noise that wasn't there before.  Very disappointing.<br><br>
