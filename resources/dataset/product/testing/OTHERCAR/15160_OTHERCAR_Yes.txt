            After nagging my girlfriend for a countless number of hours to open my eagerly awaited and equally hyped xmas present, she finally let me at it.  To my surprise I found a digital camera under the santa clause wrapping paper.  Needless to say, I proceeded to open it up, pop the four AA batteries in, and stick the included 4mb memory card into the port.  I was very pleased with the performance.

The Toshiba PDR-M60 is a mid-price camera with the quality and features of other more expensive cameras. The Toshiba PDR-M60 is loaded with built-in easy access features displayed in menus on a 1.8 inch color LCD monitor. A function button gives quick function changes and a thumb access button allows you to select and scroll through the menus. The camera also has buttons for image quality, flash, macro, display and timer allowing on the fly adjustments. Photos can be taken with the LCD monitor on or turn it off to save on batteries and use the viewfinder.

This 2.3 megapixel dreamweaver allows you to take photo-like quality images stored on a 4mb (upgradeable to 64mb) Smart Media card. The cards are capable of storing from 3 to 907 images, depending on the quality images and what Smart Media card you use. The lens is glass with a built-in lens cap. The lens has 2.3X optical zoom lens, 2X digital zoom, a macro feature for those close up shots. 

A small gripe about the camera, but I guess is true among most digi cameras is that it eats batteries like Bill Clinton eats Big Macs.  Definitely unacceptable life from standard alkalai's.  Once I got it and burned through 12 batteries in three days, I decided to order some rechargeable NimH MaHa batt's online as well as a 64MB Smart Media card as well as an AC adapter from Toshiba.  4MB simply does not cut it at 7 normal compression pics.

In a nutshell, a great digital camera with a chaulk-full of features, outstanding and eye-candylike quality pictures, for one heck of a good price.  Go out and get one now if you don't have a digi cam already, just please do yourself a favor and get some li-ion or NimH rechargeables for this baby and a bigger memory card right from the get-go, otherwise you'll be sorry you didn't.<br><br>
