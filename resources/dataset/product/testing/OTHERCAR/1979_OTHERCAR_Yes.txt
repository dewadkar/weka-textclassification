            I owned a 1998 Maxima SE Limited for a little over a year, it was a great car and I had no complaints.  Actually I didn't think they could improve on this car.  Until I test drove a brand new artic white 2000 SE.  I fell in love with this car.  I had only gone in for a oil change and left with a 2000 Se.  I now have 20,000 miles on it and it has been virtually trouble free.  I have to admit that until you learn the 5 speed you can miss a shift from 2nd to 3rd. Once you learn the transmission's "sweet spots" you can avoid this problem.  I have the automatic sun roof, upgraded bose system(which is awesome), and lots of other "goodies".  After looking at everyday drab Accords and Camry's why someone would purchase one is beyond me.  Of course the Maxima is a little more costlier than the Honda or Toyota but it leaves them both in the dust on perfomance and looks.  It did take a little time to get use to the appearance of the Maxima but in a short time I grew to appreciate the fact that it doesn't look like anything else on the road in it's class.  Interior fit and finish are superb.  The gas mileage is not bad if you can keep your foot off the floor board which is pretty hard to do. I have gotten excellent gas mileage on trips and decent mileage in town.  I wouldn't trade the performance for little bit of better mileage, it isn't worth it.
