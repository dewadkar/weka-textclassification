            The new 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse is good looking affordable and mostly very comfortable.  This newly designed car, for the old Eclipes, it looks sportier and it is faster.  What is good about this car is that you can choose if you want a 4 cylinder (V4), or a 6 cylinder (V6).  Not that long ago i just wanted to test drive the new Eclipes and i drove both the V6 and V4 they are both fast enough for me, but the good thing about it is when you need to switch lanes or just accelerate a little bit this car is really good at doing this.  I found that the V6 does it a little bit better but they are both good enough for me.  Also another good thing is that when you drove you feel like the car and you are hugging the road and it is really good at turing to.  I really would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a cheap, good looking and good quality, sproty car.  It is a really fun car to drive!!  Please go to a dealership near you and go test dive one i will garentee that you will love it!!<br><br>
