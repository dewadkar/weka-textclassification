            The joy of the Cavalier is its very well behaved handling and ride.  I effortlessly zip between lanes and slower moving traffic, with plenty of pickup considering its cost and size.  The interior front is roomy and comfortable with simple, easy to use controls.  The exterior is surprisingly modern and sleek.  On the downside, the gas mileage is disappointing, especially when you run the a/c.  Also the rear seat is pretty cramped.  Cargo space is adequate for short trips.  The only thing I really hate, is with so many mini-vans, pickups, and SUV's on the road, its often difficult to see ahead when in traffic.  Mine is black, so you can see the dirt accumulate very quickly.  Overall, this is one of the better cars I have ever had, especially considering price.<br><br>
