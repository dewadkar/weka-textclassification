            The Ricoh RDC-5300 Digital Camera is a good choice for casual photographers as well as photo enthusiasts who want to invest in an excellent high-resolution,and an excellent 2.3 megapixel digital camera!
This digital camera is very easy to use, you might get the wrong first impression about that, but let me assure you that it is easier than you might think it to be. Although the RDC-5300 is not pocket-size, the camera is very comfortable to hold, with a convenient on the lower right front corner. The controls are also clearly marked and well positioned! I think of this digital camera to be one of the best. Check it out further. You will regret it if you dont. Trust Me! I did.<br><br>
