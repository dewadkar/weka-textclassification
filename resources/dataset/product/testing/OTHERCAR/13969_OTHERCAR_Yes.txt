            And it is definately worth it.

I had a choice of a Lotus Elise 111S or an MG-F when I drove past my Toyota dealer (on my way to the MG dealership to put down a deposit) and saw a green Roadster sitting in the showroom. It just cried out to be driven, so straight away I booked a test drive and by the end of the day the deposit was in the hands of my Toyota dealer.

All I can say is WOW this car just screams fun. Pin sharp handling on a wicked chassis it feels like it is on rails. Acceleration is quick and smooth and braking is sharp with abs just incase. From 70-0mph it only takes 2 yards longer to stop than the Porsche Boxter I do believe.

Ok so how about seeing what it can really do. Well most people know about the handling and power of the Elise so how about I compare it to that? Easy. I was shocked, the MR2 really holds it's ground. Kicking off down a 1/2 mile straight the Elise eeks out a little gap. Then over some roundabouts and the late braking of the Roadster allows me to close the gap (BTW there is no overtaking for safety reasons) and into a long sweeping bend. Finally finish off on a two-lane motorway to see what speed we can get. The manual says 129mph is the top speed. Lets just say that we were doing more than that. The Elise only a small gap in front and not pulling away.

If they make a stripped-out version of the Roadster with a supercharged engine then this will be a serious contender verses the Elise.

Gearing - Not wonderful. Out accelerates the Porsche Boxter through mid-range (30-70mph) and can do with a 6th gear. However it does have the classic sportscar &quot;click&quot; when changing. And leaving towns/cities so long as your speed is 40mph or under you can have a lot of fun changing from 5th to 2nd and flooring it!!!

Two other things worth a mention. The top and the luggage space. The soft top is the sweetest I have ever seen. Heated glass, about 5 seconds to lower and 10 to raise. Either of which you can do whilst sitting down. As for luggage, forget it. If you want to pick up a weeks shopping on your way back from holiday get a different car. This is for those that like driving and like driving FAST!!!!!!!<br><br>
