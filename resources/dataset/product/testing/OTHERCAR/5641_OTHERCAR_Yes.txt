            The Long Haul is Rough At Best:
I log over 140 miles a day in this car and find the drivers comfort level compromised. Its my believe that the center console could provide added comfort in a different position to provide some sorely needed shoulder relief. 

Now its not all Bad:
This is a Sporty auto with enough pep to handle the highway and city stresses. Filled with the nice amenities that make for a pleasurable driving experience. 

While I sit in the rush hour traffic which plague the commute to and from the office I can quickly be whisked away by the 200 watt sound system to drown out the overtones of loud semi-trucks, construction work, and oh yes those other loud stereo systems placed in cars today. Couple this with the two way sunroof and you can quickly be ripped from the confines of the daily hassles to the enjoyment of the road. The spacious interior lends yet again to this overall feeling of freedom.

Truck or Car:
Coming from a former truck only man, Big Ones (not sure if I'm compensating) I was very nervous about the purchase of a car at all. Yet 34 miles to the gallon on the highway verses 18 miles quickly became a no brainer. Yet as fate would have it I needed to build some new shelves in the garage to fill all that extra parking space I acquired in the deal, I suddenly was faced with how do I get all this wood home. So I grabbed my trusty ruler out laid the back and front seats down (flat I might add) and found that I have over eight feet. So off to the lumber yard I go. All fitting nicely. 
Now I don't think I'll be moving any refrigerators, ovens, washers or dryers anymore... but is that a bad thing. No more Saturday morning calls asking to barrow the truck, which in friends language is can you come over and help me move.
Oh did I mention that with both rear seats up my golf clubs still fit nicely in the rear with the rather difficult rear cover over them I feel safe leaving them.
The Family Travels Well:
The two kids and wife are also accommodated well on long trips. The wife can still set the seat back and rest with both kids in the rear. There is enough room for the kids to avoid that, "He touched me." issue that seems to always keep into the equation on any trip short of long.

It Keeps On Going:
This car is filled with the little things that make driving fun and easy. Storage compartments are everywhere. Two on the center arm rest, glove box, one under the shifter, one to the left of the driver, and the open area in front of the two cup holders (which are ok for regular cups, no super size will be accommodated without some help.)This coupled with the fact that you never have to worry about turning your lights on or off (for someone like me) adds to my comfort. 
I also discovered another nicety with the ever oh no I just locked my keys in the car. If the keys are in the ignition the doors won&#146t lock when the car is not running. As fate would have it I left the car while talking on the phone and hit the button on the door and swung the door shut, only to look back and say,... well you probably know what I said. I quickly reached for the handle to open the door, you know like all of have done when we know we just locked our keys in, to my surprise the door opened. Not sure how this happened I got into the car and with the keys in hit the lock button again, Click, then when the door shut, Click they unlocked. Now I just use the keyless entry key fob. 
You also have to like that the rear hatch has a dual entry, open the door or just the glass. Nice touch.  

The Instrument Panel and Controls:
With its red display it is easily viewed at night and I never knew how much I liked knowing what the temperature outside was. It also helps if you have one of those spouses who are constantly telling you to slow down, they can't see the speedometer from the passenger seat. The Air and heating controls are placed behind the automatic shifter and the fan control is somewhat difficult to operate if it is in park and slightly easier if its in drive. The any direction front vents which can be completely closed however make up for this inconvenience. 
Further it has all of the things that we have become accustomed to like the gas light (without the annoying dings) and the seatbelt not fasted light (also without the annoying dings). An interesting add is the passenger seat belt light flashing boldly on the dash when anyone around 15 lbs or more is sitting in the seat.

OVERALL I LIKE MY VIBE:
Sporty 15" aluminum wheels, Roof Rack (which is a little short but functional), high roof line for added head room, easy entry and exit. Overall this has been a sound car and without troubles for me. Two thumbs up!
