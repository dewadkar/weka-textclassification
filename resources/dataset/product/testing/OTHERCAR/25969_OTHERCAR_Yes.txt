            My son and his wife bought a 1999 Cavalier from me during my brief career in the car sales field. They liked it so much that now that they're ready for a second new car, the opted for a 2000 Cavalier!

This is just your basic, quality, American young-family car. Inexpensive, stylish, and SAFE!

Two days after buying it my son was involved in a four car accident in it. Rain was a factor; slicking the roads severely as we had lacked the precipitation for some time. The Cavalier held up and protected them. We're talking an accident on a road where the speed limit is 45. Granted, he braked and didn't hit the oncoming car at that speed; but the little car did what it was supposed to do... keep the family intact!

They did have to have a new hood, grill, AC, and radiator installed. Tough luck for a brand new car... but the car parts were replaceable; THEIR parts aren't.

The car drives nicely; shifts smoothly; and handles well for an inexpensive car. The sound system is fairly good; certainly not like a luxury car, but not a &quot;tinny&quot; or &quot;cheap&quot; sound. The 4 cylinder engine has surprising pep, and the trunk is roomier than one might expect.

They opted for a blue 2 door with automatic and air. Not a lot of &quot;bells and whistles&quot;, but that's not what Cav's about. It's about quality and good price... something GM does well with THIS offering!<br><br>
