            The QV3000EX is my second digital camera.  I've enjoyed my Kodak DC120 for the past almost 3 years.  My first choice was another Kodak.  I came very close to purchasing the Kodak 3.1 megapixel model.  What stopped me? In a word, battery.  I read a review of the Kodak DC4800 and found out that it went through it's battery life quickly.  I asked Circuit City, where I was buying the camera - do you have a backup battery and how much does it cost?  They didn't carry it, didn't know where to get it or how much it cost.  I went on line and the cheapest I could find the battery for was $109.00!!!  I started looking for a megapixel camera that used AA batteries - I purchased the Casio on UBID.com for $420.00 which was cheaper than the DC4800 with a total of $150 in rebates.
So how is it doing?  I've taken close to 200 pictures so far.  Most at the "normal" quality range.  The camera comes with a 16 mb card which doesn't hold very many pictures.  I went to EGGHEAD.com and bought a 32mg flash card for $30.00.  It holds just over 100 pictures at the normal range.  I took many pictures of the ocean, coastline, and tulips, up in Washington State in April.  The pictures with only one exception came out perfect.  The colors were clear and true, the focus, perfect.  Most of them were taken in the point and click mode.  Anyway can take good pictures with this camera.  We hooked the camera up to various TVs (with the furnished cord)on our trip and showed our pictures to our hosts.  The resolution is quite as good on a 32 inch TV as a 17 inch computer monitor but the pictures looked impressive.
The only drawback to the camera was setting it up on my computer when I returned home.  I chose the USB setup since it was supposed to be a lot faster than serial (both type cords are furnished).  The software was a little confusing and it took me longer than it should have to get everything working.  It saves the files using an Internet Explorer format.  To view the pictures you actually open web pages.  Once I caught on the pictures looked great.
Final word is on batteries.  I am still using the original 2 sets of 4 nickle metal hydride batteries that I purchased for my DC120 over 2 years ago. With all of the pictures I took and showed on the TVs on our trip, I only changed the batteries out once.  The rechargeable metal hydride batteries are the only way to go.  They're $10 a set of four - two sets should work fine for anyone.  In a pinch you can always use purchased AA batteries to keep the camera going.  I cannot believe that Kodak is using a proprietary battery in their camera which doesn't last any longer than AA's would (according to the reviews for the camera).  I checked this evening - you can by the Casio at EGGHEAD.com for $437 (new, not on their auction).  For the money you cannot beat the QV3000EX.
