            <b>The Sony Cyber-Shot</b>
A fairly new creation from Sony, is blowing away other cameras; Its the sony Cyber-shot.

This camera equipped with a CCD capable of taking pictures at 1600x1072 pixels.  Thats enough to make a nice looking 8.5 by 11 inch picture.  The quality is even higher if you make a smaller picture.

So theres something I dont really agree with on this camera, the use of the sony Memory stick as storage.  The memory stick is great, very effective and works nicely, but its still rather new, and not as compatible with things as the more common Compact Flash cards.  If you already have some compact flash compatible devices you might rethink the sony products, but otherwise the sony memory stick is a great and incredibly small device.  The camera only ships with a 4 megabyte memory stick, this is only enough to hold about 3 pictures at high resolution.  That sounds pretty bad at first, but there are a few things to think about.

1) You can use lower resolutions, for instance if you are using 640x480 to take pictures to email or something, you could hold 50 or 60 pictures on the 4 meg stick.

2) Memory sticks arent expensive, you can get new ones (this is probably the most likely option)  Sony makes up to 256 megabyte memory sticks, that run pretty cheap.  With one of these you could hold hundreds of high resolution pictures and around 8 minutes of mpeg video, which i'll explain in the next section.

The sony cyber-shot has the capability to take mpeg videos, not very long ones, due to the small storage capacity of the memory stick, but still really neat.  You set the camera to movie mode, and you can record a high resolution motion video with audio.  You can then put these videos on your computer, or your vcr/tv.

Perhaps your arent really a computer geek, and you cant do lots of image editing on your computer. Well the cybershot has you covered, it has all the abilitys you need to edit your pictures right on the camera using the bright screen and the menu keys.  You can resize, rotate, crop, and add effects before you print the pictures or put them onto your computer.

My favorite part of the camera is the fact that you can just plug in a high speed USB cable (included) and get the pictures from your camera onto your computer in a blast.
