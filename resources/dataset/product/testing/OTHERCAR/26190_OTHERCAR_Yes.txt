            The VW 2001 Passat is worth every penny! This car is loaded with standard and optional features that only come in German cars! 

The interior of the car is roomy and comfortable. Mirrors in the visors, and a sun visor above the rear-view mirror are great little extras. The front seats are roomy and the arm rest doubles as a storage compartment. The back seat is roomy, although it can get croweded for a family with a car seat.  The back seats also fold down to make room for large items such as skis, luggage, tools, etc.

The glove box is very small, so don't plan to use it as a storage space. However, it does have a cooling system in it, so soda cans stay cold on a long trip. Other than a few cans of soda, don't plan to store much in the glove box.

Our car is a 4-cylinder with a turbo, although the same car is available in a 6-cylinder. The turbo gives the car just the "umph" I life when I am driving. I feel like a race car driver every time I pull up next to someone at a stop light... The car hanldes very well with a smooth and comfortable ride. The cruise control works well, although it took me a few days to learn how to adjust the speed up and down. 

The car handles well in nearly all conditions. It does much better than most cars in the snow and rain because of its detection system that alerts you when conditions are hazardous. It also has a traction feature that helps the tires grip the road in the snow and ice. A reminder buzzer also rings when the car detects ice on the road. The onboard outdoor temperature gauge also helps make the driver aware when the temperature is dropping or conditions become dangerous.

This car is also very safe, with front and side airbags built in. The bad thing is if you ever get in a wreck with minimal damage, the cost of the airbags alone is quite high. However, the safety of the car is at the top of its class. The seat belts in both the front and back are comfortable, yet effective. Onboard computer systems also alert the driver to dangerous conditions (cold temperatures, ice, etc), making the car very safe.

The Passat makes for a quiet ride, unless you really try hard to make the turbo kick in, then you can get loud if you want. 

The windows have a one-touch feature that rolls them all the way up or down with one touch of the button. You can also roll the windows down through the keyhole on the outside of the car (as seen in the Jetta commercials).

The keys are electronic, so you can unlock or lock the car and set the alarm from the keychain. You can also unlock the trunk from the keychain. The keys are made so they can not be duplicated (the downside to this is if you lose your keys, the replacement cost from the dealer is $125).

A feature I love is the heated seats. Both front seats have individual heat control settings, from 1-5, heating up in only minutes. Great feature for cold, Utah winters and long night-time drives.

The Passat get good gas mileage, around 26 mpg overall (a little less in the city). It works well with either super or premium unleaded gas. (Here in the high Utah mountains, it works well with reg. unleaded as well.) 

The computer travel log keeps track of your average mph in a trip, miles travelled and average miles per gallon of gas. 

We have the 6 CD changer in the back of the trunk and the sound and quality is great.  There are all sorts of other little extras you can get to make your car even more fun and practical. I love the sunglass holder (above the driver side door), the trunk liner, for carrying groceries or other items that might spill, and the trunk net, so your items don't fall when you are driving.

Overall this is a car-lovers dream for a mid-size car with a great price tag. We shopped around and compared prices and quality, deciding on the Passat as the number one choice. Consumer Reports agreed.
