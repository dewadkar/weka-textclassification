            My new 2002 Toyota Corolla CE is still less than 2 weeks old. I got it for a little over $14,000 with tax, tags, registration included. I have to say, the price is very reasonable. 

All of the Corolla models (CE, S, and LE) have the same exact engine unlike the Civic. The only difference is the interior and exterior features that are included. With the CE model, you will get all of the basics you need. You get manual windows, power locks, AM/FM/Cassette stereo, air conditioning and automatic transmission. If you pay a few thousand more for the LE, you will get stuff like side door moldings, body colored door handles and side mirrors. 

The Corolla has a good engine, much better than the engine of the Echo. I test drove both and the Corolla has much better acceleration than the Echo. The front headlights are a little more cool looking than the lights of older models. The trunk is fairly roomy and the interior of the car is fairly roomy as well. It also drives well and has good handling. 

It doesn't have anything special, its just a plain car with no stylish or flashy things. Its a car for the economical person who doesn't mind having a plain, somewhat boring-looking car. Another plus is that it is made by Toyota, which is know for its high quality, low maintenance cars. So all in all, good car for good price.
