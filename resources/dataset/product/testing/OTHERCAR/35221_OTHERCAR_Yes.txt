            Having owned a Nissan Pathfinder and having driven the Explorer, Suburban, Durango and Blazer, it was no contest when it came to choosing the 4Runner.  Toyota's motor and drivetrain components last forever. The resale value is phenomenal compared to other SUV's.  There's a certain cult-like following of Toyota 4WD vehicles, which says a lot about the product. My SR5 4WD averages about 18mpg in the city, which isn't bad considering that my old 90 Maxima only got about 2mpg better. Now, it certainly wasn't cheap, but in my opinion, well worth it.  Here's what I like:
Rear power sliding window/ 6-disc in-dash cd player/ solid feel to the doors / tight suspension / crisp steering / decent cupholders / easy controls / 

What I don't like: Seats are comfortable, but not substantial (wish I got leather)/ didn't buy an optional cargo net, which is needed for hauling groceries / doesn't hold as many people as a Durango

Handy thing I bought for the car: A one-piece plastic lipped cargo mat (around $85.00) for the cargo area to protect it from spills<br><br>
