            I bought this camera about a year ago when I was expecting my second baby.  We always took pictures with our regular camera, but would never get around to taking the film to the store to be developed.  With a new baby on the way we had to figure out something!

After looking at a few stores, and not being real happy with anything, we found this Fujifilm MX-700.  I really really like this camera!  What caught my eye at first about this camera, other than the great price, was the sleek design.  Also the size of the camera played a big role in my decision to buy it.  We needed something small to be able to tote around with the massive amounts of baby stuff we had to carry.  

We got the camera home and started to play around with it, taking pictures of nearly everything!  The installation of the software went very well, it was very simple.  Also, the downloading of the pictures from the camera to my computer was also very easy.  The pictures looked great once I got them onto the computer.  The software will save them in different qualities for you, low, medium and high.  When I take pictures, people are always remarking how clear they look.  I am very happy with my digital camera purchase and I'd recommend this camera to anyone.<br><br>
