            Okay, you usually do not see commercials for this vechicle, they are usually for the Blazer and the Suberban. But let me tell you that this car does not suffer at all because of that. In case you are wondering this car is kind of a cross between the Blazer and the Suberban. It has the two front seats and the back seat of the Blazer, but it has the trunk of the Suberban. This car is extremally comfortable, it has leather seats, adjustable backs, and arm rests. It also comes with a lot of extras such as many cup holders, a klenex holder, little compartments, change holders, note pad holder, and much more....
This car is pretty affordable for an SUV, it comes with the choice betweent swithcing between 2 and 4 wheel drive, and it has a running bourd for you shorter folk. If you can I heavely suggest this SUV, it runs spectacular, and is very practicle. <br><br>
