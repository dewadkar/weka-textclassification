            where do I start I am sold on this car!  My first one was a 1988,now I have a 1994.  Great little car.  Low maintenance.  Great gas mileage.  Handles well in traffic.  Easy in and out of parking spaces.  It lasts forever.  Starts every time.  I think for the money it is a great little value.  The up keep is just your basics.  Oil change every 3000 miles.  I think any one can drive this car!           <br><br>
