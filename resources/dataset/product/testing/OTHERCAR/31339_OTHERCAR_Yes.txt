            I bought the Audi A4 Quattro the first year it came out, in 1996. Having owned this car for five years now, I can share with you both my initial impressions and my experiences with this car. I thought this approach might be useful both for the person seeking to buy a used A4, as well as someone looking for a new Audi wanting to know if the cars are a good investment.

<b>Early Decision </B>
I had been looking for a great-handling smallish four-door with a manual transmission. Here, as I recall, was my short list at the time:
Nissan Maxima
Honda Accord
Dodge Stratus
BMW 3 series
Audi A4

Having had a good experience with one of the early Dodge Intrepids (Remember "The New Dodge"?), I first started by looking at the Dodge Stratus. But, in typical American fashion, the version with the best engine was not available with a five-speed manual, only the automatic. Apparently, from the U.S. manufacturers' point of view, a manual transmission is for people who can't afford the automatic. For me, conversely, the automatic is for people who don't care enough about their driving experience to shift for themselves.

I had also looked at the some of the Japanese cars, particularly the Maxima, which had been positioned at the time as a "four door sports car" which was exactly what I had been looking for. Honestly, I can't tell you much about the Maxima, because my experience at the local dealer was so negative that I just abandoned the idea after my first visit.

I therefore was leaning toward the BMW 3 series. They were expensive but provided the driving characteristics that I had been seeking. But, just for the sake of being comprehensive, I visited the Audi dealer to try out the then-brand-new A4.

My opinion of Audi at the time was that they were an overpriced VW, with less-than-stellar long-term quality, so I wasn't really excited about the marque. But after driving the A4, my mind changed completely. Here was a really solid-feeling drive, with lots of great driver feedback. Further, it had the Quattro all-wheel drive which, for someone in New England, promised some great benefits. BMW's were notoriously "bad winter cars" as we say up here. You may also remember that, at the time, Audi was still smarting from the rap they had taken from "60 Minutes" about unintended acceleration. So, the car came with a three -year, bumper to bumper warranty. Even oil changes were included! Finally, the two models, with comparable features, were about <B> $8,000 apart in price!</b>

Case closed. I crossed my fingers with regard to the long-term build quality and bought the Audi. I rationalized it figuring the cost savings in the immediate would by far outweigh whatever the long-term repair costs might be.

<b>Later On</B>
I can tell you that I have never regretted the decision. The Audi A4 has been the best investment in a new model car since my 1979 Mazda RX-7 for $7400 (now I am dating myself, aren't I?). After five years, it is still a blast to drive, provides really solid feedback, looks great, and has only required moderate maintenance after the warranty period. I am told that at 70,000 miles a repair costing about $900 is usually needed (I am at 70,000 now), but looking at the cost of new cars, that is short money indeed.

The quattro has proved itself to be an outstanding all-wheel drive system, allowing me to be mobile and confident while others are sliding and slipping all around me.

<B>Minor Nits</B>
Some of the controls in the A4 are a bit quirky. While in the wintertime the climate control system will not blast you with cold air (it waits until the engine is warm enough, then starts blowing air at the set temperature); in the summer it immediately starts blowing at the maximum fan rate, even though the air conditioner is not yet providing cool air. 

Also, the radio volume control is apparently some kind of digital knob, rather than a traditional potentiometer. Therefore, making small adjustments in the volume of the radio can provide undesired results. Turning the knob down slightly can sometimes cause the radio to BLAST, and vice-versa. Really annoying.

Some people object to the headlight switch being mounted on the steering stalk (it doesn't bother me) and also to the dash lights being red in color- I actually like it at night.

<B>Conclusions</B>
People usually ask the question, "Would you buy another one?"

My answer, for the first time in my car-owning life, would be, "yes". Except I believe my next one will be an S4, with the 2.7-turbo instead. Why not, right?

If you are looking at a used '96, check the repair record. If the mileage is 60K or more, ensure that there has been service on the thermostat (in the engine) and that the water pump is OK. Also check the radio to see if it's working the way you'd expect. I am told that the timing belt can go at around 90K miles - if it does, the results can be devastating, so take care of that ahead of time at about $800. If all that checks out, then you should be in good shape. 

Enjoy it - I have, and continue to do so.
