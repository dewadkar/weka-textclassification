              Your looking in your local &quot;Cars by Dealers&quot; and you see, &quot;1991 Chevy 
cavalier Z24 for 4000&quot; You think, it's just another cavalier, but I'll go check it out. You pull up, and see it there. Suddenly, it doesn't look like any cavalier you've seen. Maybe it's the cool air cowls at the top of the hood, maybe's it the racing wheels, or maybe it's the bright &quot;Z24&quot; on the side of the car. But you think, nah, just looks sporty. 
  You open the door, and are greeted by a roomy interior. You sit down and the seat wraps you in comfort. You look straight ahead, and see the racing style steering wheel, and the tach with a 6000 redline. Nah, you think, it can't be this good. You put the key in the ignition and turn.
  The engine comes to life, with a low raspy note. You rev the engine a few times just to make sure, your ears aren't decieving you. Wow, you think, this is not like any cavalier, I&quot;ve been in.
  You slide, the transmission into first, and slowly start off. The smooth shifting transmission almost shifts it self. You're finally alone on the road, so you slow to a stop. Your floor the car, the engine screams to 6000, and you drop the clutch. YOu are greeted by the squeal of the tires, and glorus gray smoke. YOu shift into second. The tires make a pleasant chirp. Your doing 55 and you make the shift into third. By now your doing 80, you shift into forth, and 105 comes pretty darn quick. YOu make the finally shift into 5 and, hit 110. WOW, you think, I'm inlove.
   
  Ok, first off, this car isn't a ferrari, it is still a cavalier somewhat. Don't think that when you get it you'll be able to stomp z28's or mustang Gt'S. What this car offers is sporty handling and a powerful V-6 at a low cost. Since, everyone here, seemed to give this car a bad review I figured, I'd take it upon my self to straighten everything out. I'll review each part seperatley.

EXTERIOR   
Chevy did a nice job on hiding it's cavalier beginings. First thing are the cowl induction's which really make the plain hood look cool. Then there are the ground effects. It makes the car look low to the ground, and really aerodynamic. The racing wheels make the car, and the &quot;Z24&quot; really set's it off.

INTERIOR
It's your basic cavailer interior with a twist. Z24 emblems are on the door panels, and the gauges are different. The radio remains stock, and the controls are extremely easy to reach. The lighted dash is one of the best one's I've ever seen, you can read everything clearly. The major difference is the racing steering wheel.

ENGINE
  The &quot;Z&quot; is powered by GM&quot;s 3.1 multiport fuel injection V-6. With 150 hp and 195 lb's of torque, this engine puts out a good deal of power. Although a few more horses wouldn't hurt, it's enough to keep the tires squealing for a good 60 feet, and fast enough to propell the car to a 0-60 time of about 7.4 seconds.

TRANSMISSION
  You got two choices. Sluggish GM automatic, or a racing tranny designed by Getrag/muncie, orginaly designed for use in the fiero. This is one of the smoothest shifting I&quot;ve ever driven. I love the shift from second to third, It's like butter. And the best part is, the harder you use the transmission, the better it works.

SUSPENSION
  Luckily while chevy was making this car they decided to give it a sports suspension. They almost got it perfect, not to stiff so it doesn't throw you over bumps, but not to soft. The steering feels tight, and you can easily take turns at 25-30 miles an hour above the posted speed limits, and you won't hear the tires squeal. But once again, it still is a cavalier, NOT A FERRARI. The car handles well but it's no Testarossa. 

STEERING
  The car has very tight steering. It's very accurate and where you point the car is where it's going to go. But, it is front wheel drive and it has oversteer. Not near as much as other front wheel drive cars I've driven, but you can tell when you take a corner too hard, the tires will kindof slip. 

CONCLUSION
Once again, this car is no exotic. It has good power and crisp handling but it is still a cavalier. If you want a backroad burner for about the same price, get a supercharged MR2 or V6 Fiero. But if you want a car that is handles competively around the backroad twistes, has a backseat, has a big trunk, won't kill you for insurance and payments, and looks almost as good, then the Z24 is the car for you.  <br><br>
