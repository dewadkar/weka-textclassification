            There was no way to get me to drive a van.  Absolutely NO WAY!!!  I was not going to be one of those &quot;minivan moms&quot; tootling everywhere in her little ugly tub on wheels!  Not me!!!!

Can you say &quot;eat your words?&quot;  Well, that is what I had to do when I was faced with replacing the little car that had taken me everywhere for over 10 years.  I took that little car on our honeymoon, and brought both of my kids home from the hospital in that little car.  It had sentimental value and the car that replaced it had better be special.  

Enter this van.  There really was nothing not to like about it, but it was a van, and no matter how you looked at it, it did have the tub on wheels look to it, but somehow better looking than all the tubs on wheels that I had seen everywhere else.

SO, still trying to stick with my attitude of never, I test drove all the SUV's that I could possibly stand.  I drove the Jeep models, all of the Suburbans, and others, but I finally test drove this van.  What a difference!

The way this van handles is just like a luxury car.  It is on a car chassis after all.  The other ones were in a different category all together and the way they handle can't really be held against them.

I love the four doors in the van.  I haven't had experience with only three doors, but I can't imagine only having three.

This van is not good on gas.  I am not sure how it compares with all the other vans in it's class, but it seems to always need refueling, and I just drive around town like your average minivan mom (I hate that handle!).

I have heard the lemon stories attributed to this vehicle, but I have been very lucky.  I will let you know if this changes okay?  (Where's the wood to knock on?!)<br><br>
