            My last car purchase was a 1999 Saturn SL2 sedan and it has been the greatest car - runs great, decent looking and good gas mileage. I had owned Toyota Corrollas for a decade but when my last Toyota started it's decline (at over 200,000 miles I wasn't surprised) I was still in graduate school (ie., poor) so I looked for something less expensive. I tried all the other under $15,000 cars and they were either too small, too tinny or just plain ugly. I've not regretted buying the Saturn once and plan on upgrading to a LS Series Saturn when this one is ready to be replaced (I drive about 40K miles/year). 
One of the nice things about Saturn is the service I've received from my Saturn dealership. The purchase was simpler than any car purchase - no games, they gave my husband and I a gift certificate to a local restaurant while the car was prepped to leave and the paperwork finished and by the time we had eaten all was ready. After the purchase, the dealership called regularly to see how we liked the car and when we've taken it in for service the work has been done well, the people friendly and the prices reasonable (for a dealership). We live about 75 miles from the dealer so when we need service we always get an appointment and the dealer has been on time getting it in and out. The car wash and flowers at service time are nice too!
one word of advice though - spend the extra thousand and get the SL2 - the extra power is worth it. <br><br>
