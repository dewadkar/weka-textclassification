            I bought my 95 berretta over a year ago and still love most things about her. The 3.1 litre v6 is strong and will get up and go quickly. It's got an automatic transmission, easy to read analog gauges, comfortable cloth seats, adjustable delay wipers, handy cargo net in the spacious trunk, and a beautiful dark purple paint thats tough as nails. With 70k miles it runs well except for a little shudder in the low rpms on the highway. I fixed this problem last summer with new spark plugs, but it seems more like a fuel sensor or filter problem this time. Other than that, it's still the best car I've ever owned. I paid $7500 for it in late 98 so it was a good deal for a sporty 2 door that looks this good. This car is perfect for a first car for a student because it's easy to work on and fairly cheap to do so. I put new front brake pads on myself in about an hour and a half for $35. I installed the best lifetime pads for that price! The anti-lock brakes work very well and the drivers side airbag help make it very safe to drive. I highly recommend this car and wish GM would bring them back.<br><br>
