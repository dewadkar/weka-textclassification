            This review is from a car dealer and owner of the Olds Intrigue.  I've driven approximately 6 of these, in all conditions and milage.

I bought this used with 33,000 miles on it.  Was going to purchase the Alero, but this caught my eye (along with the extra 75 horsepower!).  The first thing that I noticed was the gas pedal.  WOW!!!  As a car dealer, I've driven hundreds of different makes, but this is one of the few that really put some spring into your step.  When you accelerate, you notice a heavyness to the gas that is very accurate in determining your speed, unlike most GM's and Fords, Lexus and BMW's who enjoy a floppy pedal. (i have no other bad things to say about BMW ;)  )  

The room and comfort level is well rounded, even in cloth, and a 6-way power driver seat is very nice to have.  Sadly, amenities are few.  I am in love with the factory sound system.  Cd and cassette, great reception, 6 speakers with mids and tweeters in the front.  Surround sound is very pronounced.  I've had over a year to test everything on this vehicle.  The air conditioning takes a little longer to kick in than I'm used to, it gets cold right away, but doesn't seem to want to cool the entire car on a hot day until about 15 minutes later.  A rear vent should have been an option.  Duel climate heater works very well.  Positioning of devices are well thought out.  Even a short person can reach everything comfortably. (I'm 5'10".)  
The day lamps are a nice addition and I can never purchase another car without Twilight Sentinel.  This automatically turns on your headlights when it gets too dark.  Last year I had an old Pontiac I would leave the headlamps on when I took it to work.  I had to get jumped 4 times.  No more!

The car doesn't feel bulky and you always seems to feel very in control.  It's extremely responsive, especially with the addition of the Speed Variable Steering (magnasteer), alloy wheels, and sport tuned suspension.  I have some serious trouble dealing with the cornering though.  The all-season tires don't really seem to go with the car.  I'm about to install some low-profile 17" rims which should take care of most of the problems.  You can take a cloverleaf turn at about 40 before the tires begin to emit that horrible screech and you feel the car yaw (lean).  It has a very wide wheelbase, just 1" shorter than the Grand Prix, which is highly necessary considering the 3500lbs. of weight on the vehicle.  Don't let me scare you, I drive hard.  Under normal circumstances, such as passing another vehicle at 65-80, you don't feel any yaw and the car is super-glued to the highway.  Anyway, what nutbag goes 40-50 on a sharp offramp with two kids in the car?  Leave the kids at home :)

The governor limits the speedometer at 111mph and 4th gear kicks in at about 80mph.  Even doing 100mph you can bring the RPM's down to around 1700-2200, stomp on the pedal and feel the car lurch forward, blowing away the competition.  The listed 0-60 is 8.1 seconds, however I've been able to accomplish 7.6 without aftermarket parts.  The only car near it's class to beat me so far is the Ford Mustang GT 4.5 ltr.

If you're worried about safety, let me reiterate the control you have over the vehicle.  Even in a blizzard and heavy rain in Minnesota, I've had full control and great traction at normal speeds.  The windshield wipers do their job well and the thick sidewalls on the all-season tires were practically chosen for a police force.  Duel front airbags are standard, however side air is not an option.  If you're looking for a nice family car, this is it.  I have two infant sons and a wife.  We enjoy it and have taken plenty of comfy road trips.  The top tethers for the car seats are a must.  If you're looking for a car for your grandmother, it's a bad choice.  The suspension is not like a Buick's, and the starting line power will scare her.  It's touchy and you have to treat it with care.

If you're looking for a super-fast drag racer, this won't do the job.  With the addition of low-profile tires 17-18", a new duel exhaust, the Tornado air/fuel cylinder, and a chip in the engine, I think you could get this car from 0-60 in 6 seconds.  (Can't forget the blue day lamps, fog lamps, and white headlights.)

Getting away from my favorite subject, "speed", lets get down to earth.  Compared to like year 2000 models, this car is supreme at it's price range.  If you're looking for something in it's class, don't listen to the magazines, listen to someone who's driven the vehicles more than once.  

Now at 52,000 miles, I'm starting to come across a few problems.  Breaks of course are natural.  I just had the rear and front pads replaced.  I've been having trouble with starting the car since around 40,000 miles.  I took it in and a GM dealer replaced the air/fuel monitor.  Well that only worked until 48,000 miles.  We still need to find the "real" problem.  The left front wheel bearing is shot.  It's about $350.00 retail/labor to replace it.  Not sure if it's my erratic driving or Oldsmobile.  The left rear turn signal blinks abnormally fast.  Still works though.  It's too soon to tell if this is a trouble car.  Normal wear and tear and all that.  There is spilled juice on the left rear seat...my kids.  Lost that "new car" smell at 38,000 miles.

Thought I'd put together a list of selections for you.  I have driven most of these vehicles and done quite a bit of research into the components of each.  Enjoy!

Comparable vehicles are as follows:
Buick Regal GS; Impala LS; Camaro 3.8; Firebird 3.8; Grand Prix GT; Monte Carlo; Eclipse GTS; Diamante VR-X; Chrysler 300M; Accord V-6; Nissan Altima; Camry Solara; VW Passat 2.8ltr.

Commonly misconceived vehicles that can't compare due to lack of power and/or features:
Malibu; Sebring; Camry; Mustang(standard); Intrepid; Stratus; Taurus; Grand AM GT; Celica; Jetta.

Incomparable due to greater costs and features:
Camaro Z28/SS; Firebird 5.7; Mustang GT; Corvette; Grand Prix GTP/GeForce; Bonneville; LeSabre; Park Ave; BMW; Lexus; Audi; Volvo; Saab; Acura; Lincoln; Cadillac; Jaguar.  (I won't bother listing Lotus, Ferrari, etc..)

Incomparable due to over-all vehicles or unbalanced engine-to-features vs. Intrigue:
Mazda; Mercury; Hyundai; Kia; Daewoo; Saturn.

Remember, this is e"opinions".  Email me at jayride4_jc@yahoo.com if you have any questions about the Intrigue.  I'll be glad to help.  I haven't even begun to touch base on what this car is about, but I'm running out of writing space.  If you have negative comments, email Oldsmobile.
