            I did A LOT of research on high end consumer oriented cameras and this one came out on top for me.  It has pretty much the same &quot;guts&quot; as the industry standard Coolpix 990, but packaged in a smaller case, cheaper, and a few more features.
I purchased the camera in Canada so it comes with a standard 16MB compact flash card rather than the 8MB sold with it in the US.  I also purchased the optional rechargeable battery and charger (a must).
It takes great &quot;point and shoot&quot; pictures in the AUTO mode (for those times when you don't have time to set up all the options in the camera).  For a little more control, the Scene modes set most of the options for specific types of pictures.  The real beauty is the full manual mode where you can set every little detail of the camera which can result in some outstanding pictures.
When people look at the pictures I print from it, they don't even realize that it came from a digital camera.  If you want high quality pictures and ease of use as well as full manual control, I recommend this camera.<br><br>
