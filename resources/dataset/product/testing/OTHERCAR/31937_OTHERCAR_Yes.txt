                 I come from a family who own Celica's and that means a lot of them! lets see, my sister has a 1990 celica GT automatic hatchback my dad drives a recently purchased used 1993 GT automatic coupe and me and my mother used to share a 1994 less powerful ST automatic hatchback, that is until I became a proud owner of a super sweet MKIV Toyota Supra! (read my review of 1998 Toyota Supra)  

     My experiences with all of the celica's mainly the 1994 gave me mixed feelings about the cars electrical workings. the 1990 is in pretty bad shape. the dealer sold it to us used back in 94' and until now we thought it was a good car which in fact it was. It held up very well but like all living things cars have a life span as well and this car must have had some sort of a stroke because all of the sudden the car seemed to forget how to roll the windows up, lock the doors, use the air conditioning, and once it even forgot how to drive! (the power steering went out) On the other hand their is the 93 which performs like and looks like brand new, it is practically perfect! then comes the 94' Toyota switched some things around to give it a whole new look and feel which was good and bad. safety on this car is good the style of this car is good but again the electrical system is below average, things have gotten way better in the later models of celica's they just had a few electrical bumps in the road. Don't get me wrong this car is a very nice car! 

     Good looks good gas mileage and a pretty good sense of power for the price of the car which is also easy to swallow and it is every bit as good as any other contender like the integra (acura) and the eclips (mitsubishi) the only other problem with this car is the road noise but unless you are wearing ear plugs in side a luxury car your gonna hear the road. an all around good car. if interested in a car for a reasonable price you should consider the celica when getting ready to purchase. and if you have the money to spend spring for the 2000 on up model they are veerrrrry nice.          <br><br>
