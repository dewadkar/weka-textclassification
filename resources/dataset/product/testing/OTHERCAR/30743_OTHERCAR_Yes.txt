            I love my Olympus camera!  (FYI, mine is a 340-L, which came out before the 340-R, so there may be some minor differences.)  At the time I bought mine (nearly two years ago), it was the best bargain for the money around.  I was most interested in a camera which took crisp, clear, colorful pictures.  After a particularly bad first impression from a Generation 1 Sony Mavica (very fuzzy pictures, bad color, lossy compression), I determined to settle for no less than photo-paper quality images from a digital camera.  The quality of the images on the Olympus far surpassed its contemporary competitors which cost several hundred dollars more.  

Now, after two years of new technology, the price has dropped quite a bit from what I paid, but the quality (and even the *relative* quality) is still top notch.  The color and the clarity is excellent, even in the highest resolution (which is traditionally a problem with digital cameras, as some interpolate pixels to attain higher resolutions.)

Only problem - it sure eats batteries (but hey, what digital camera doesn't?)  My recommendation is to buy NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride) batteries for this camera.  They're expensive, but you'll be glad you did.  The charge on these batteries lasts almost forever, even when using the camera extensively.

Also be aware that there is no USB connectivity.  You'll have to use the included serial cable (which works just fine, not as slow as it sounds) to upload pictures to your computer.

FYI, I bought additional SmartMedia cards at Wal-Mart of all places about a year ago - 8MB for only $20!  I'm sure it's even cheaper now.  These were very expensive when I bought the camera.

So if you want a great digital camera for fun or a vacation or whatever, this is a great one to have!<br><br>
