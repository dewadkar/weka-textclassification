            So, you've looked around, you know exactly what your looking for, but you can't find it. You want a sporty and fun car that your friends and co-workers will be jealous of, but you want it to be in your budget and safe to drive your family around in.  Well, then the Honda Civic coupe is exactly what you've been looking for! So many modifications can be done to it. I personally put tinted windows, a spoiler, Altezza taillights and now chrome hubcaps on mine. But you want all this to be in your budget range and also safe for you and your family. The Civic coupe ranges from around $12k-$17k, gets up to 37 miles to the gallon, lasts well over 250,000 miles, and has been rated extremly high for all its crash test results. I'm 50 and feel like a kid in my Civic coupe. But my secret is other than it being an extremly eye-catching car, its safe and a money saver.<br><br>
