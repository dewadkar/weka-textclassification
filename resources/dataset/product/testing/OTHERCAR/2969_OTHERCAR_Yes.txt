            Have had my '98 2WD Navigator almost 2 years &amp; have loved every minute of it.  Two recalls were handled by dealer in minimum amount of time - - - no more inconvenience than waiting for an oil change.  It is a gas guzzler but not significantly worse than other SUV's.  The seats are very comfortable and it is very quiet.  The car handles very well in all kinds of weather.  The biggest negative about the car is that in my area I am somewhat limited as to where I can get it washed as many of the car washes have only 6' clearances.<br><br>
