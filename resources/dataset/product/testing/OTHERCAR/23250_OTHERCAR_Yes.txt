              I bought my '95 Avusblau M3 about a month ago.  I have to say it is the best car I have ever driven, let alone owned.  Previously I had owned a '96 Civic which was well modified.  The suspension on the Civic was replaced by a whole (expensive) aftermarket suspension.  After driving the M3, I realized the Civic has nothing on the M3s stock suspension.
  When I bought the M3, it was out of state.  The drive home, my first time driving an M, was incredible.  The drive was smooth, the handling perfect and it seemed effortless to drive.  The car made 14 hours fly by, it seemingly drove itself.
  The interior of the M is very tasteful, and very German.  The dash and the center console is very purposeful, with no wasted space.  Everything is angled for the driver to see.  The On-Board computer gives the driver just about everything he needs to know such as MPG, avg speed, miles 'til the tank runs out, dist until your trip is over and more.  My M3 has the Dove Grey leather interior which is a soft white/grey color.  The sport seats offer great support everywhere while being adjustable at any angle desired.  The seats will not fit an larger individual, as the support is made for someone of average weight.  As could be expected of any coupe, the backseat does not offer a lot of room for passengers.  If you desire room in the back, go for a '97-'99 M3 sedan/saloon instead.
  The exterior of the M is beautiful, with the lines of the other 3-series but with a new front air dam, side skirts, rear diffuser and optional M wing.  The engine offers the power to back up the sporty exterior and will catch many a domestic sports car off-guard.  All in all, I have absolutely no regrets about spending the money on this car, and I think it has to be one of the greatest cars BMW has built.
