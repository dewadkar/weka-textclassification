            Hi everyone! The HP 315 camera is a nice camera for the price. My husband is 6'4 and has large hands and this fit well in his hand where as I am 5'1 and little hands so this was a little on the bulky side for me. I followed the directions and took some pictures of our daughter etc. However when it came time to download the pictures....I had a problem. I immediately called HP and they told me that they were having problems with the Windows ME USB and could not get my pictures to download. HP told me to call my pc manufacturer. I have an emachine and they have a terrible warranty...only a 15 day warranty after your first problem then you have to pay 25 dollars a problem. I called Emachines and they recommended that I return this product as it does not work well with Windows ME. I bought this camera because of the USB capability. The only way I would be able to use this camera is if I purchased a card reader. I didn't want to have to use this as I wanted to be able to directly hook this up to the USB. If you have Windows ME I do not recommend this camera. However, for those of you with Windows 98 etc....this is a nice camera and the images on the LCD appear very clear. I found the menu screen etc easy to use. I didn't realize after I purchased this that it does not allow you to choose the speed or the black and white or sepia tones. I wanted a camera that did that. For the price the camera is a good deal and offers a higher pixel than other cameras at this price. I bought this one for $250.00! If you are a beginner and do not want a lot of frills just the high pixel than this is a good camera. I did find that the camera drained the batteries fairly quickly so I definitely recommend the ac adapter which you can purchase fairly cheap on ebay brand new. All in all...if this camera had worked with my PC I would have kept the HP 315 and been HAPPY with it! As of now I still have not bought another....watching the opinions of others! I hope this helped you!
