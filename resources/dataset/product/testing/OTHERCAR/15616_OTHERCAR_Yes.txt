            My father recently purchased the Sony MVC FD91 and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it!  Let me tell you I was not disappointed!  This camera is excellent! Okay enough with the exclamation marks!  I have tried other digital cameras- usually in the  $300.00-$400.00 range.  They upload the images to the PC via a connector cable and it is time consuming and cumbersome. 

The Sony is light years ahead of everything I have seen to date. Recording the images on a standard floppy is the only way to go.  One 3.5&quot; floppy holds 14 pics and you can even add narration to the stills. The 14x zoom is about all that is needed and with the optional wide angle lens there isn't any photo situation it's not ready for. In addition to taking great pictures it can record up to 60 seconds of mpeg footage with sound (one floppy holds 30sec @ 160X112 res. or 60 sec. @ 320X240). Image load time is quick (with the revolutionary 2x high-speed disc drive), and it is so user friendly even my dad can use it. 

Everything is automatic- it really is a zoom point and shoot- and if you don't like it delete it and shoot again. The on-screen menus are easy and quick to use whether you are viewing or deleting. The 2.5&quot; color screen is crisp and multi-position. I have used the camera on several occasions to record my 5 month old son Alex and for web based imaging- I have given up using my scanner because the camera is so muck quicker and versatile.  I did notice the flash tends to wash things out if you're trying to get good resolution for web images but a little creative lighting (and Adobe photoshop) takes care of that issue. 

For standard pictures the flash works fine and it pops up with the touch of a button and is ready to go.  With this camera you don't need anything else, it performs so well that you can junk that old 35mm and put the money you used for developing into a packet of photo paper for your color printer. The $999.00 msrp price is not cheap but worth every penny- if you can't afford it ask YOUR dad to buy it.  I love the age of technology.<br><br>
