            After 7 years of driving GM products I finally decided to expand my horizons and purchased a metallic gray 325 sedan with the premium package, sport package, upgraded stereo, CD player and leather.  This was a definite step up from my 1998 Chevrolet Camaro Z-28.  

Before I actually purchased my BMW I was considering a wide variety of vehicles.  I had almost talked myself into getting a reasonably sized SUV (Mazda Tribute ES or Chevy Trailblazer LTZ)  The gas mileage on both of them was reasonable, but with gas prices being so high I really wanted a more efficient vehicle.  The Trailblazer was going to cost me $34,000 to purchase and could only manage 22 mpg on the highway.  I'm not sure what clicked in my head that made me realize that I could purchase a German sports sedan for less money, but I'm sure glad I did.  My BMW 325 can get a little over 30 mpg on long trips and is actually cheaper to insure.  My Z-28 cost me $3200 / year to insure the first year I owned it and the 325 only sets me back a little over $1500 (gotta love Progressive!) I know most people don't think of BMWs as cheap, but they really aren't that expensive to own.  With 3 years of scheduled maintainence and four years on the standard warranty, I know that repairs won't break the bank... at least at first.  Also, not having to go in for an oil change every 3,000 miles is nice... gotta love those German engineers!

On my test drive the first thing that I noticed was that it wasn't exactly easy to get the car rolling.  Sure, I'm not an expert with a manual, but I did fine on all of the other cars I'd driven so why not this one?  In the BMW's defense, I'm sure the 2 stalls (yes, I know... it was embarassing) during my test drive were my fault.  However, once rolling along the manual transmission was amazing.  The car really begin to feel like an extension of me which is something I have never experienced before.  I never knew that driving could be this much fun.  This car almost makes me wish I had a longer commute to work. Although I tried to hide my grin from the salesman, I was unable to... it was really that much fun to drive.  He knew I was hooked.  I did find it odd that 5th gear was not an overdrive gear... this keeps the RPMs relatively high at interstate speeds, but the super-smooth engine still doesn't detract from the driving experience.

Living in the South, I didn't consider the all-wheel-drive package to be worth the extra money and reduced fuel economy so I obviously passed on it.  I'm sure if I lived in a snowy region that the $1750 extra would have been money well spent.  The decision to go with the sport package was a rather easy one... the 17 inch rims are gorgeous and the sport seats make it incredibly easy to find a comfortable sitting position.  I was a bit concerned about the firmer suspension, but even with the firmer suspension the drive is very civil.  The decision to go with the premium package was a bit more difficult to make... with the exception of the sunroof, I could live without everything else in the premium package.  However, I had the money and the appeal of all of those extra buttons and gadgets overwhelmed me.  If I ever let my girlfriend drive it I suppose the memory seats will come in handy.  The wood trim was a nice surprise... although a bit too shiny, it worked really well with the black leather interior.  I'm amazed that $10,000 cars now come with CD players standard and yet it is still a $200 option on a BMW.  At least it's already pre-wired for a changer.  

A great feature for people in warm regions is the keyless entry... it can lower all 4 windows and open the sunroof allowing all of that hot air to vent.  Sure, it's a simple feature but it's a very thoughtful one as well.  On an interesting note, it will not raise the windows which I found odd.
