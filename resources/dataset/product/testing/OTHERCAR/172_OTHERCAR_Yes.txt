            This camera is great. You get a lot of value at a great price.
It is easy to use and comes with the software and cable that you need
to interface with the pc. Also has a zoom function included where you
can zoom in on a picture after it is already taken. You can also choose
the resolution of your pictures. There are three options. Of course the 
higher the resolution is the fewer the pictures you can take without erasing or saving some or all. 
The package that I got also had an offer for a free card reader or floppy
adapter so that you would not have to hook the camera up to the computer
you could just take the disk out and use it to view the pictures. I love my fuji digital camera.<br><br>
