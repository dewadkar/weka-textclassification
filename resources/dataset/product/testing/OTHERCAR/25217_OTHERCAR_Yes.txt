            I found myself in need of a rental.  I thought, Oh, no!  Another low powered, penalty box that will be worse than my 1989 Mazda.  I scoured the yellow pages to see what else I could find locally, and to my surprise, the Richmond, Indiana Toyota dealer was listed.  I called them up, expecting prices somewhere in the $40-50 range per day, with 100 miles.  To my surprise, they quoted $25.99 per day, unlimited mileage on a Corolla.  That is $5 a day cheaper than Enterprise, better than the 200 miles a day Enterprise was offering, and I wouldn&#146t be stuck in a 3 speed Neon or 1999 Escort.  Um, I'll be right there.

One great feature of renting from Toyota is the choices you have for putting gas in the car.  You are given three choices on gas.  #1, Buy the tank of gas it comes with at 10% discount.  #2, Fill it before you come back.  #3, if you don&#146t buy the tank, and you don&#146t fill it, you pay $5 per gallon.  Unfortunately I wasn&#146t given a choice, because when my rental rep brought the car around for me, it only had � tank full.  I was given the choice to wait for them to get gas, but I was ready to go, so I only have to arrive with more than � tank of gas.

I drove the car about 600 miles.  I recorded about 30mpg with my lead foot.  When I dropped off the car I was charged about $85 for 3 days.  The experience was a good one, and I think I know now what my next car will be.  At least I know one thing.  It won&#146t be from Enterprise.

If I were to write a review on Toyota&#146s rental service, I would give it 5*s.  The service is pretty good, the price is outstanding, and you can&#146t beat having a Toyota for a rental car (as you will see in the rest of the review.)

There are three trim levels for Corollas: CE, S, and LE.  The LE is top of the line, and to my surprise, that is the car I was given.  It came with Indigo Ink Pearl (Dark Blue) paint, and Light Grey Fabric interior.  It also came with Option package B, which includes an All Weather package, ABS, cruise control, and a 6 speaker AM/FM/CD/cassette.  And it had a little less than 1800 miles on the clock.  If you were in the market for a car like this, you get all of that for around $17,000.  Sweet.

The Engine:
At 130hp, this is no wimp car.  True, with the automatic, it only gets to 60 from 0 in about 10 seconds.  But you don&#146t buy a Corolla to go racing in.  That is the world of Ford Focuses, Honda Civics and Dodge Neons.  Corollas are sedate family cars that are good on gas and eat up freeway miles.  And with this engine, you can get out of more than your own way.  It was quiet at 65, but push it up to 75 on the interstate, and expect road and engine noise to be a little more than normal.  I had to turn the radio up a little when on the highway, and back down in the city.  

The only other complaint I have about the engine is the throttle.  Initial tip in is smooth, but if you want a little more power, it is hard to be smooth about it.  It took a little getting used to, but it can be done.

Exterior:
Corolla exteriors have always been understated.  With the new model, it sheds its conservative threads for something a little more risqu�.  And it works for me, sort of.  The headlights are huge, and the only thing that keeps the exterior from being perfect.  The lines are smooth, the grille is understated, the taillights don&#146t look like something you would get in the aftermarket, but they take some of their cues from it.  The dark blue, um, I mean Indigo Ink Pearl paint goes well with the whole design, although I probably could have gone for a nice green.  The Mineral Green Opalescent you can get when you order your car, however, looks kind of like an army staff vehicle.  I&#146ll stick with the blue, thank you.  The only other racy looking colors are Red and Black, with various shades of White, Grey and Beige in the mix as well.

I love the door handles.  It is hard to describe, but when you grab the handle and pull, you pull the latch and open the door in one smooth motion.  They are color coded with the car, and they look good, too.  So many cars could learn a lesson by looking into the design of these babies.

Overall, the fit and finish of the exterior is what you would expect of a Toyota.  Gaps between doors and body panels are uniform, the paint is flawless, but the wheel covers are a little bit cheesy.  If I were buying this car, I think I would go for the alloy wheels, either $500 from the dealer or something nice from the aftermarket.

Interior:
I give the interior one word, smooth.  The seats are cushy and supportive.  The plastic doesn&#146t look cheap, and has a very good texture.  Even the faux wood doesn&#146t look out of place here.  

I&#146ll get my complaints out of the way, first.  I do like the instrument layout, but at night, the lighting is annoying, even when dimmed.  Most cars have a black background with white or orange lettering, but the LE (and the S) come with white dials with green letters.  This is ok in the daytime, heck; this is great in the daytime because bright sun on it makes it easier to see, not harder.  At night, it lights up as a light green background (almost like a Timex Indiglo), and all that brightness can be annoying when its dark outside.  Dimming helps, but I think Toyota should have stayed with the black gauges.

The greenhouse in this car is great, offering great views most of the way around.  The back seat headrests are huge, though.  Good for the comfort of all those people I won&#146t be having back there.  And it gets in the way when changing lanes, making it very hard to see if you have cleared the car you are passing.  If it were mine, I would find a way to take them out, because they are just plain annoying.

My favorite part of the interior is the stereo.  Wait a second&#133 okay; it is a six-speaker system.  Where did they put the subwoofer?  (Trust me, there is none, I checked.)  This system definitely packs some oomph.  It sounds like an aftermarket system, and whether you play Bach, P.O.D., or Ludacris, this stereo will play your sounds better than most car stereos.  The back speakers are 6x9 and are mounted on the deck over the trunk.  Front door speakers are 6 �&#148, and there are tweeters located in the A pillars inside the mirrors.  The controls are intuitive, with a dial for volume and power, a dial for bass, treble, fader, balance and tuning.  Buttons are big and well lit.  The display is an LCD with green backlighting, with big numbers.  And with the option of CD, cassette (for those who still have them, or want to plug in their MP3 player) and a very good AM/FM receiver, you have many options to keep you entertained on those long drives.

The driver&#146s seat is a very nice place to be.  The steering wheel just feels right, not too thick and not too slick.  The airbag is not too big or chunky, and you can press anywhere in the center to honk the horn (although it is embarrassing to do so.  Why couldn&#146t they have a manly horn?)  

All controls are within reach, although at 5 foot 11, I have to reach a little to get to the radio.  Imagine being 5&#146, the reach might be huge.  The heater/air conditioner unit has three dials.  One is for where you want the air, one for how fast you want the air to get there, and one for what temperature you want the air when it gets there.  It is a simple design that makes it easy to adjust and not take your eyes off the road.

Controls around the steering wheel are where they should be, with one exception.  The cruise control stalk is behind the wheel under the right spoke of the steering wheel.  Why there, I don&#146t know.  It feels sort of like an F-1 gear toggle and might get in the way when turning.  There is a button to turn it off all together, though, so you won&#146t set it on accident while making turns in the city.  It also should be lighted, because at night I couldn&#146t remember whether pushing it up was set, resume or what.  I guess if I owned it and got used to it that wouldn&#146t matter.

Ride and handling:
This is a small car.  True, it is tall, the inside is roomy, but at the end of the day, you have a 2500lb car.  This means a nice tight ride, quick steering (although the steering on this car was not as quick as it should be) agile moves, and lots of engine and road noise.  If you are like me, you love small cars and forgive them of their shortcomings.  Thus, it wasn&#146t a surprise to me that in the Corolla you can find all of these things.  

In its defense, the ride wasn&#146t as harsh as you might expect.  The engine only let itself be heard when it was working hard.  The road was almost absent at 65, and tolerable at 75.  On top of that it took to turns 20-30 mph faster than the yellow warning signs said to, it had very solid brakes and gave nary a complaint.  Compared to my dad&#146s Buick Park Avenue, it is a harsh mistress.  If you want a car that returns 30-35 mpg, fits in small parking spaces, can turn around in a small space, and has a surprising amount of room inside, this is a good car for the job.
