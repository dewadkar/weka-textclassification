            This car, and all the del Sol VTECs, are the most fun for the money.  Expect to pay over blue book (around $10K in 3/2001) if you can find the rare VTEC.  Currency exchange and insurance rates for kids killed this car in the end, just like the CRX-Si before it and the MR2 contemporaneously.

Built on a Civic chassis with some changes to accomodate the targa top upper body, the del Sol has 90% in common with its more mundane sibling.  That means it is more reliable than any relatively low production sports car should be...some question exists to whether Honda ever made any money on these, or whether they were an image leader for the sedate sedans and confining coupes normally sold.

Although not a high-performance car like the Mustang GT, the del sol VTEC actually beats the numbers of the earlier V-8 Mustangs in all respects...its 160HP VTEC engine and modest weight replace thundering V-8's and tire-thrashing with finesse...and handle better than any Mustang or classic sports car of the 60's ever did (excepting certain Italian supercars costing more than the average annual salary of the time.)

The car handles very well against modern convertibles as well.  You should understand that due to the lack of a permanent roof, affordable convertibles tend to be unable to corner quite as hard as muscle cars with roofs, due to the trouble making the bodies as stiff.  You can fit stiffer suspension components, but these produce relatively little improvement in numbers at a great expense in feel, comfort, and even safety.  (When the road makes the body twist, it acts as a spring, storing energy for a moment and then returning it to the road, making handling less predictable than designed.  This is NOT a problem in any factory configuration.)

It is actually very roomy and comfortable, unless both occupants exceed 350 pounds in weight or 6 feet in height (yes, meet the writer....)  Amazing what removing the rear seat does to front seat room!

Although the weak point in Hondas in general is their electrical system, the del Sol is neither better nor worse than the others.  Expect an unreasonably early battery replacement, as the battery is about the size of a couple of lantern batteries.

Although an extremely obese person can ride as a passenger (a friend pushing 500 pounds once fit briefly, albeit uncomfortably), seatbelt extenders are not available for any Honda or Acura.  Although this matter is currently subject to NHTSA adjudication, Honda's official story is that seatbelt extenders would compromise the system's safety.  Technically speaking, that is bulls**t, as Honda shares belt mechanisms and makers with Nissan (although the colors won't match if you get them from Nissan.)  The real reason is that the retractor design really is marginal for longer belt lengths...they were designed for Japanese waistlines rather than the more sumo-like US.

Although the tops in early models leaked a little, these (mine was one) were subject to a service bulletin and fixed upon owner request.  My car was subjected to both Austin, TX summers and Kansas City, MO winters without undo trouble.

A final plus: as the car was based on a Civic with much more glass area and interior volume, the A/C in the del Sol rocks!  (Just as well, with a black car in Austin!)
