            I just bought a 2000 Accord V6.  Before the purchase, I had read all the e-mails from people who owned similar cars.  My old Accord (an '86), had 150,000 miles on it, so I gave it to my son to drive for another 100,000.  I read again and again about how the transmission on the 2000 model was lousy, how there was a clunk when you shifted from neutral to reverse, and on and on.  While I've only got about 500 miles on this car, but let me tell you this is the nicest car I've ever owned.  Hands down.  It's smoothness is eerie.  Half the time I can't even tell its running.  The transmission is as smooth as you want it to be.  Put your foot in it, and it'll shift like a performance car.  Drive like you should, and it's as smooth as any car I've driven.  I had a slight clunk in my old Honda, and it's still running strong.  Many people compare this car to a Camry.  That's the Accords natural competition.  I also own a Camry.  These are two totally different cars.  Each wonderful in their own way.  My wife loves the feel of Accords.  You feel the road; the car corners as if on rails.  It's unbelieveable!!  I love this car, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxury performance sedan.  I keep my cars for many years, and I have no reason to suspect that this one won't take me down the road for hundreds of thousands of miles.  If you've got any hesitation about the Honda Accord, let it go.  This is a fine automobile, built in the Honda tradition of quality and reliability.  Happy motoring.<br><br>
