            This is a great camera with a lot of good features.  The quality of the pictures is great, the features of this camera are great, and the use of this camera is really easy.  This camera is really good for its price

First, the quality is just outstanding.  The LCD display is kind of small but the pictures are really easy to see because it has such good resolution.  The pictures come out really good when you transfer them to your computer and print them.  The flash makes the picture a whole lot better.  This is a really good flash and really helps the visibility of the picture if it is just a tiny bit dark.  

Next, this camera has exceptional features.  One feature that I find personally great is that after you take a picture, you can view the picture but while viewing it, you can zoom in on it to see how good the image's resolution is.  I'm not sure exactly what this feature is for but you can zoom on a picture you have taken.  Another good feature is you can hook the picture up to the Video input of a TV or VCR (yellow one of the A/V inputs), this is good because then you can put a picture on a the screen of a TV so you can see it big to see just exactly if you want to keep it or delete it or just to see it in large form.  You can also take video images which are really cool just there is no sound which kind of sucks.  You can also watch these small videos on a TV just there is no sound.  On the LCD display, you can view pictures 9 at a time, the pictures are very small while they are shown 9 at a time but you can tell which one is which and you can go around the screen picking the picture you want, then you can delete it, zoom it on it a little, or you can keep it.  There are jusy a lot of features that are really useful on this camera.

Finally, the use of this camera is really easy except for that one button, the "enter" button not the click button.  It is just like any camera where you push the power button and click and you take a picture.  If you are trying to delete photos or set the time, this is where the enter button comes in.  To do these things you have to move a little cursor which you use arrows to move around.  Well the arrows are all connected together on one circular button and the enter button is the center part of the arrows so you try to press enter and you can just as easily change it to another photo or date or something.  I think they could of done a little better on that.  But as far as taking pictures and small video clips, this is extremely easy to use.

This camera is one of the best ones out on the market today.  Sony also gives 20 dollars in Sony cash if you register it with them online.  You can't have the $20 given to you but it is kind of useful because you can use it towards a bigger memory stick for the camera because it only comes with a small 8MB chip.  The chips cost a bit more than $20 but it is still 20 bucks off of a bigger memory stick in which you can hold a lot of photos.

All in all this is a really good camera.  The pictures come out great, the features are awesome, and the use of it is really easy.  Even though it is kind of expensive, you are getting a really good camera.  It is also really small and easily portable and can fit almost any where.  The camera comes with all the cords you need to hook it up to your computer and TV or VCR.  This camera must be hooked up threw a USB port so you might want to check to see if your computer has a USB port on it.  It is a great camera and is one of the best out there.  I hope this review was helpful.
