            Well previously I did a review on a Dodge Ram.  The Ram is a MAN'S TRUCK.  But over XMAS we took that Ram to Las Vegas.  That is a 1000 mile drive from here in Texas.  The kids were crammed in the back, they fought, my wife had no room in the passenger seat.  I was tired of the complaining.  So I told myself that when we get to AZ. (our final destination) we are going to look at VANS.  So when we got there we went to the Chrysler dealer and inquired about the T & C.  

The van that I bought was a used.  It had 18000 miles and I paid around 21,000 for it.  They did give me a great deal on the Ram, so I didn't mind paying a little extra for the van.  Anyway, I was a little skeptical.  I wouldn't have my V8, take no crap on the road ram anymore.  But I'd have to say that I am very impressed with this vehicle.

I love the fact that I get around 20 miles to the gallon vs. the 13 with the ram.  And the engine, I feel like I am driving a car.  Sometimes I have to "rev" the engine just to see if the van is still on.  The engine is a V6 and it creates the most smooth ride I have ever felt.  It is so smooth, that on the way back from AZ I didn't realize that I was going over the speed limit and got pulled over twice!  By the way, it took me 1 day to get back from Phoenix.  The comfort was extraordinary.  The kids have plenty of room to lay around or stretch their legs.  

The middle seats came with two "installed" child seats.  Very nice!  The middle and back seats are removable as well.  Although, I would have to say that is probably the biggest drawback to this vehicle.  It is kind of a pain and it takes two people to carry the seat.  If you are strong, one person can do it, but other than that, you will need help.

Having two sliding doors on both sides of the vehicle is great.  I don't have to GET IN THE VEHICLE anymore if I need to strap my son in the VAN.  AND just to let you know of the room in this van, well, my wife doesn't even get out of the van to unstrap my son.  She walks to where he is in the VAN, unstraps him, opens the side door and they both hop out.

Bottom line, there is a ton of comfort to this van.  It looks real classy, drives real smooth, gets great gas mileage, and so far (knock on wood) no problems whatsoever!

Buy it!
