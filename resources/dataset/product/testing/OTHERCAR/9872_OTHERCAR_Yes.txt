            Ok, so here is the lowdown on why my wife and I choose the Sequoia SUV over many others for our new family car. Basically my wife and I are toyota fans and have owned at least one toyota since high school. As we have progressed through life we have moved from the reliable 4x4 Tercel wagon to the ultra reliable FJ 60 and FJ 80 Land cruisers.
All three vehicles went at least 190K with no engine or transmission problems and were running fine when we sold or traded them off. We wanted to replace our 1994 FJ 80 Land Cruiser ( 190K miles and still no oil leaks ) so we started testing all the Bigger SUVs to compare( I am not extremely wealthy and I really could not afford a new Land Cruiser so that was out ) them to one another. We drove a used 1998 FJ 100 Land Cruiser and were extremely impressed with all but the price ( around 40K for a used one with lower miles and of course with little or no warranty in most cases on used cars ). Next we checked out Fords Excursion Diesel 4x49 around 44K at the time but due to lack of sales the prices have been slashed in my area to around 36K for a 4x4 diesel model decently loaded) and it was a nice freeway ride that would get nearly 20 mpg( but remember diesel cost more unless you are using the vehicle for business and get a PUC permit which cheapens the fuel cost) and tow a house if needed along with carrying all the furniture inside it vast interior. The drawbacks were the size, cheapness( junky plastic wood trim instead of real wood trim or just plastic trim ) of the interior, and poor handling in city driving conditions.We then moved onto the Chevy Suburban/Yukons 1500 and 2500( again in the low 30s to 40K plus price depending upon options).The 1500 was a smooth driving and comfortable cruiser that will hold the family plus some but it had bad front windshield vision for the driver and low ground clearance for off-roading use. The 2500 rode like a tank and was stiffly sprung but it did have a gas guzzling powerful engine that made it jump to high speeds quickly for such a large and heavy vehicle it did have slightly better ground clearance but still had poor front driver vision( the roof pillars were in my field of view when driving it ). Finally we went to the Mercedes ML 320( 36K and up) and just loved the ride and comfort but it was a bit small for our needs. The Mercedes appears to be a great vehicle for smaller families our couples but when you have 2 kids and all the camping gear for a weekend or a road trip it was just to small and besides when you add relatives or kids friends it gets even smaller and you have to special order a third seat for the back which is listed at 2500. Basically these were all the rigs I considered before the Sequoia( I failed to mention the Ford Expedition but before you ask why I will explain: I work for a local county and we have several of these( 2000 and 1999 models ) in the fleet and we use them in the field but they appear to be cheaply made and ours have had several problems already( leaking brake systems, door seals pulling off, and the engines have gotten louder as the miles have built up( 50K on one and 35K on the other one )). Also, when getting into them you tend to hit your knee on the dash which is a real pain. So now I will tell you why we choose the Sequoia: Well for starters we like the reliability of the Toyota and I expect my new Sequoia will get over 150K with little or no problems( a big plus when spending 37K on a car ). Other major considerations we had were these: It is rated a ULEV which is a acronym for Ultra Low Emission Vehicle and helping our planet anyway possible is great, It is rated at 17 mpg highway and we take long trips so every mpg counts( nearly 18.2 on our first 600 mile road trip after we bought it and that was mixed city and highway driving), We like comfort and room and this has both with seats far superior to my Land Cruiser seats as far as comfort goes and the power option was nice but it is not needed, It has great driving vision and you can see all the road easily no matter what your size( I am nearly 6 foot and my wife is 5'4' so as you can see both big and small can drive it and see out of it fine ), My only real complaint ( well besides the price ) is the vision for the driver while changing lanes: it is not the best so look several times and check the mirrors as well, It holds all our camping gear inside and we do not need the roof rack that came with the vehicle. Other great features are the smooth running engine which has plenty of power for the real world ( if you are going to tow a trailer or boat and still want to drive 75 then get a SUV with more power like the Suburban or Excursion ) and this is where I have to comment on anther opinion in the Sequoia section ( the one by soupcraze ) I do not know what this guy/gal is talking about in terms of power( remember this is a SUV not a ZR1 corvette ) as the engine offers plenty of passing power and will long outlast any of the engines that were mentioned in the review. So, now that you have read most of the rambling review for the Sequoia let me tell you a little more before I go: The Sequoia is nearly 20K less than a Land Cruiser and has the same engine and similar drivetrains( both have independent front suspensions and auto transmissions ) and besides a few options they are nearly identical vehicles. The Sequoia has optional leather seats but we like cloth and choose the SR5 version which basically lacks leather and the 10 disc CD player along with the side curtain airbags and front side airbags. I got one with the sunroof( a really big one that offers plenty of light ), alloy wheels( again the same size as the Limited ones and same tires but a different pattern of spokes ), power seats, hood deflector( works great and keeps all bugs at high speed off the big window ) and dual climate control AC( kids in the backseat love this option ).
All of this and the legendary Toyota dependability as well.
Did it cost a bunch? Yes, but when you compare and shop around for what you get it is hard to beat considering the comfort and reliability and it is a vehicle that will have decent off road ability as well( not as good as a land cruiser but close and how many of us go on the rubicon for a sunday drive?).
