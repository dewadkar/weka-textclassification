            In 1998 I had purchased a 1996 Rodeo after looking and test driving everything from Explorers to Jeep Grand Cherokees.  After owning this SUV for two years, I wouldn't trade it for anything.  I have a two wheel drive, but you would never know it. 

 After a two month visit to Rochester MN. in Feb and March, I came to appreciate my Rodeo very much. After personally owning a 4x4 SUV in the past, you can imagine my surprise when I backed over a two foot snow drift without even realizing it until I was on the other side. 

 This vehicle has met and surpassed all of my families needs, and it will probably in my posession until it falls apart (which will hopefully never happen).  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone with multiple kids.  You can find room to haul just about anything your heart desires, I know I do. 

 If you are in the market for an SUV, take a Rodeo for a test drive, I think you will be VERY happy you did. I know I am, and I was bent on getting Explorer, now they don't even interest me.  

I have had NO mechanical problems with my Rodeo other than what was done to it when taken for routine maintanince (ie. oil change)<br><br>
