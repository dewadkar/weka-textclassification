            I bought my 1992 Geo Storm off the showroom floor brand new.  I test drove several cars before choosing this one.  The main reason I chose it was because it was comfortable (I am quite tall), peppy, and it had the safety features that I was looking for (side impact beams, and airbag). Also, I think the Geo Storm is a cool looking car.  

I have now had this car for 8 years -- it's STILL cool looking, the styling is not outdated.  More importantly, it has never broken down.  I have never had ANY major repairs, other then brakes and tires...etc..etc..

My Geo is still getting the same gas mileage now that it got when I drove it off the showroom floor and is still very peppy.  My Geo Storm now has 220 000 Km on it -- and still going strong.  It is very comfortable for two people (even on long trips), but the back seat is not comfortable at all for adults, there is no headroom -- small kids however, fit great!!  Folding down the rear seat allows for an amazing amount of storage space.  

Considering the reliability of my Geo Storm...and the price I paid for it...I am VERY pleased with this car.  The ONLY complaint that I have about this car -- is that there were no intermittent wipers on the base model.  (this can be irritating on &quot;misty&quot; days).  

I LOVE MY GEO STORM!!! And would buy another one if I had the chance!!<br><br>
