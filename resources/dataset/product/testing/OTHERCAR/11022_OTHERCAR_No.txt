            We bought our Chevy Astro when we learned we were expecting our third child.  We chose it because of the affordability and roominess.  It was the biggest &quot;mini&quot;van that we could find, and it seats 8 rather than 7 like most minivans.  It had been highly recommended to us, also.  At the time we would have preferred a Suburban, but we also needed to find a bigger house to accommodate our growing family, and didn't want to spend that much money on a car.  

The Chevy Astro has been quite a disappointment.  At first we were thrilled with it, but it didn't take long before we learned that the reliability is terrible.  It has been in for work at least 12 times in 3 years, including three times that it had to be towed.  We have had major problems with the fuel injectors.  Probably 5 of the visits to the shop, and all the towings, were related to fuel injector problems.  Both of the motors for the automatic windows have had to be replaced.  There have been, and continues to be, problems with the brakes.  The windshield wipers motor has had to be replaced (and this is southern CA-- it's not like it's getting used everyday!).  

Very definitely, there have been things about the Astro that we have loved.  Our family fits in it with lots of room to spare.  We have hauled more stuff around in it than I ever imagined it could hold.  The front passenger's seat does not have much legroom, but the rest of the seats are surprisingly comfortable.  None of these advantages can outweigh the difficulties we have had with the poor reliability, however.  I can't say I wish we had bought that Suburban, though.  Next time we will steer clear of Chevys.<br><br>
