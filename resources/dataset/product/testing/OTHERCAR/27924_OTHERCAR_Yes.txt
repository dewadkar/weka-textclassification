            My husband bought this car out of revenge.  I had commandeered our '95 Lexus SC400, and he was stuck driving an Infiniti I30 he'd leased for business reasons.  As serviceable as the I30 was, it didn't have the sporty excitement or power he loves in a car, so a couple of months before the lease was up, he began searching in earnest for its replacement.  We had decided to buy this time, and since we'd had such success with our pre-owned SC400 for three years, we were again in the market for a luxury car, pre-owned and with low mileage, if possible.  This time, however, we needed a sedan.  <br>  After much research and test driving, it came down to a Mercedes E-class, a BMW 500 series, and the Lexus GS400.  Several factors played into the final decision to purchase the GS400.  <br>  <br>  First and foremost, cost.  More care for more money, especially since my husband insisted on having a powerful and fast V8 engine, because he does a lot of freeway and distance driving.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, reliability.  While both Mercedes and BMW are legendary for the overall excellence of their product, both repair and routine maintenance of their cars often cost as much as 50% over that of Lexus.   The '95 SC400 we'd purchased in '97 had never had a problem since we'd had it, and we were impressed with both its reliability, quality and the great service we'd had at our local dealership.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, personal preference.  Unlike the Mercedes and BMW, which tend to be &quot;stiffer&quot; riding cars, Lexus provides both great performance AND luxurious creature comforts, including a softer ride.  My husband loves the speed and power of this vehicle (0 to 60 in 5.7 seconds!), and the added fun of the special E-shift system that allows the driver to manually upshift and downshift using buttons on the steering wheel itself. <br>  <br>  The interior of the car is commodious and comfortable for all passengers, and the dashboard design and controls make driving both fun and easy.  The sound system on our GS400 includes a 6-CD changer in the glove compartment.  Dual air climate controls are efficient and convenient.<br>  <br>  Negatives?  There are some, though they are few.  This is not a car that is going to set any exterior design standards, certainly.  The trunk is much bigger than it appears to be from the outside, but since most of its depth is under the rear seat, it's often difficult and awkward to place or remove stowage.  With a huge V8 engine, gas mileage has varied between 18 and 20 mpg in the three months we've had this car.<br>  <br>  The GS400's boxy, conservative-sedan styling disguises a very powerful performance car, a perfect vehicle for those who want the exhilaration of driving a sports car with the convenience and versatility of a sedan.  It's a great combination, and one that we appreciate even more after owning and driving one for several months.<br><br>
