            I am not a car guy.  I want something that will get me from Seattle to Portland every few weeks, and that looks half decent.  The 1989 Toyota Corolla I bought half a year ago has done this extremely well.  The price I paid was $2000, which I consider a steal for the incredible reliability.

If you are looking for a decent priced used car for a high school or college student this would be an excellent choice.  While it may not be real sporty or luxurious; it's not something any kid will be embarrassed to drive.  It actually has a little power behind it, at least more than a Honda Civic, which I would compare the Corolla to.

The car could be a bit roomier in the back.  It's definitely not suited for five large people, and getting four tall teenage boys inside is difficult enough.  A family of 4 may get a little to close to each other in this car as well.  

If you can find this car in the range of $2000-$2500, with not much more than 100k miles; I would say get it immediately.
