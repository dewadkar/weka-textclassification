            I got my Michigan driver�s license on July 17, 2000 - the same day as my 16th birthday.  Several days after that, my parents and I went looking for a car for me.  I looked at both new and used cars, but finally realized that a new car was the only option for me, since I didn�t want to deal with the problems associated with buying a used car.

I looked at several different models of new economy cars � 2000 Volkswagen Jetta (too expensive), 2000 Honda Civic (too common), and the 2000 Jeep Wrangler (too expensive and too utilitarian).  Then, we pulled into the local Nissan dealer�s parking lot.

I spoke to the salesman about the new Sentra � it seemed like I knew more than he did about it.  It has a 1.8l four-cylinder engine, with 126 horsepower, 129-lb./ft. of torque, and some other technical specs that I can�t remember now that I have the car.  I knew what options I wanted too:  Black, with Convenience package and Immobilizer option, along with the automatic transmission.

I learned from the salesman that they didn�t have any that fit my description on the lot, but he could order one for me.  I was just about ready to order one until I found out that it would take anywhere from 6 weeks to three months to get it from the factory.  Since school was starting in about a month, I couldn�t wait that long.  I decided to shop around a little more.

Several days later, I got a call from my salesman.  He told me that he had just gotten a car that he thought I would like � a Blackout GXE with Convenience package, automatic transmission, and floormats.  I went down to the dealer to take it for a spin.

Nothing compares to that first test drive: the July breeze rushing through the windows while Semisonic played on the stereo (I brought the Semisonic CD to test out the sound system).  I was pretty much sold on the car at that point, and when I returned to the dealership where my parents and the salesperson stayed, I told them I wanted to get this car.

We arranged to pick it up three days from that test drive.  When we arrived at the dealership, I saw my small, black, shiny machine sitting out front in the dealer�s lot.  After a few pictures of me with the car, the salesman came out, and we all went inside.  The figures on the car are as follows:  MSRP � $15,048, Monthly payment � $264.99 (36-month lease).  I pay $200 per month, and my parents pay the $64.99 + insurance.  I had a job at a golf course over the summer that pays for my car payments this year.

This summer I washed the car 3-4 times per week, and even up through October, it got a bath at least once a week.  That�s how much I love the car � imagine if I owned a $45,000 car instead of a $15,000 car!

Oh yeah, the car.  I LOVE it!  Every morning (at 7:10 am � ugghhh) when I get in it to go to school, I enjoy every minute of the 15-20 minute trip.  It handles pretty well in the snow on the skinny 14-in. tires, and the ride is surprisingly smooth on the country roads that make up my daily commute.  The backseat is pretty small, and that�s one of the drawbacks when I drive my friends out to lunch or around town on the weekends.  But the seats are very comfortable, and I�m just waiting to take it on a long trip to see how the seats feel over time.

The gas mileage ranges from 25 mpg in the winter and snow to about 34 in the summer � and I�m a pretty conservative driver.  The 1.8l four-cylinder engine is relatively peppy � I have no problems getting around town, and it feels like it can go faster than the 70 mph on Michigan highways.  Getting up to highway speed takes a little while, but that�s one of the trade-offs for a small displacement engine with good gas mileage.

The sound system could use some improving.  Granted, I didn�t get the 7-speaker 180-watt system with a built in amp and subwoofer, but the four-speaker system needs some improving in my book.  I�d like to add one 8� sub and a small amp in the trunk along with some new Sony Xplod speakers, but alas, it�s a leased car so I will have to suffer.

To anyone who has a relatively short commute to work or school, and who doesn�t want to spend that much money on their car, but wants to enjoy their car, I would definitely recommend this car.  It fits me perfectly, in my opinion, and I would like my next car to be a Sentra SE with performance package.  Now THAT�s a car to lust after!
