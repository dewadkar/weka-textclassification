I've owned several GM and Ford products over the years, but only one Chrysler - a 1985 Chrysler Fifth Avenue - and it turned out to be one of the best cars I've ever owned. 

The Chrysler was used daily as my second car, my 1989 Cadillac Brougham saved for special occassions. What I really liked is that the car was small enough to be maneuverable, yet big enough for all my needs. Despite its antiquated two-barrel carbueration, the car accelerated well. It was also very economical on gas and would be happy running on regular, something I can't really say about my current '94 Cadillac Deville.

It's styling was traditional American luxury with a capital &quot;T&quot;. It was a unique two-tone silver metallic over dark red enamel with a dark red landau roof. Whatever became of the flashy two-tone combinations of the past. The silver and red was particularly striking. It also had the wide whitewall Firestone tires, wire wheel covers, rich button-tufted leather interior and a unique crystal hood ornament. What also was nice that instead of just &quot;idiot lights&quot; the car had full instrumentation - a rare feature on a mid-80s American luxury car. The car also came with the compliment of other goodies such as power windows, locks, seats, and one of the best air conditioning systems I've seen anywhere.

But my Fifth Avenue's appeal wasn't all superficial. It's lesser M-body siblings - the Plymouth Gran Fury and Dodge Diplomat have faithfully served police and taxi fleets for years. Fragile cars aren't pressed into such demanding service.

It had the bulletproof 5.2 litre (318 cid) engine whose reputation is legendary. The Torque-Flite transmission can withstand tremendous abuse that would instantly destroy today's FWD transaxles. The car also had Chrysler's unusual torsion-bar suspension which first appeared in 1957. 

Whatever problems I had with the car are some minimal they are barely worth mentioning. Sometimes the &quot;Door Ajar&quot; light would stay lit although the door was snugly closed. This was remedied by replacing a tiny striker plate and limit switch on the driver's side door opening. Sometimes the car would stall in wet weather, but it immediately restarted.

People still ask me whatever became of that beautiful red car I owned. I sold it to my brother some years back. He saw the car parked in my parents driveway while I was away on business for a month and drove all the way to Patuxent River, MD from Northeast Pennsylvania to tell me he wanted to buy my car for his wife. They still have this car with 130K on it and it still runs like new.
