            I was originally going to buy the Honda Odyssey but was disgusted at the dealership markup.  I loved the van but thought paying $28,800 was a little too much.  I went with the next best thing: the Toyota Sienna.

I took an ad from a local paper listing a 2000 CE for the dirt-low price of about $22 K.  I ran to the dealership which tried to tell me that it wasn�t available anymore.  I told them to stop lying because the ad came out that very morning and I was literally the first person at the dealership!  After some yelling, I got a beautiful CE with power, running boards, and a tow package (which I didn�t need). 

I am very happy with this purchase.  I�m actually a Honda fan but I might switch.  First of all, this van oozes quality:  the dashboard is solid, the doors open and close with a �thunk.�  If you�ve ever driven a Ford Windstar or a GM Astro or a Plymouth Voyager, these vans can�t be put on the same page as the Sienna.  Everything about this van is impressive:  the seats are comfortable, the CD/cassette player works well (but not great)�the Honda Odyssey doesn�t even come with a CD/cassette player; it only comes with one or the other and if you want both, it costs about $500-$900!!�crazy company.  The transmission is butter-smooth (4-speed with OD) though the van could use about 25 more horses (addressed in 2001 models).  The rear AC works well, though the controls are a bit confusing:  what looks like a temperature gauge is actually a controller for the upper or lower vents.  The only small criticisms are a slight lack of space in the rear (compared with Odyssey), a bit low in the horsepower dept., poor fuel economy (but all vans are pretty bad), and terrible sales dept at local dealership.

The only van that is clearly better is the Honda Odyssey but you will pay thousands more for it, if your local dealership even has it.  You also can't get goodies like leather seating and a moon-roof.  If you have the time and money, get the Odyssey.  But for most of us, the Toyota Sienna is an outstanding purchase that is clearly better than every other van except for the Odyssey.

UPDATE
July 4, 2001

I recently had a problem with my right (passenger) door window:  it wouldn't go up.  I could only put the window up with the driver controls.  I went to a local dealer and they 'fixed' it in 25 minutes.  Actually they replaced one of the power window switches.  It was under warranty so I didn't pay a thing, except for my time.

I've had no other problem.  My gas mileage is averaging 19 mpg (I do 50/50 local/highway) and I've driven about 12K miles so far.
