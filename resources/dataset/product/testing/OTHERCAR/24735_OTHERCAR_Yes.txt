            I thought that I would give everyone a big heads up on purchasing this camera for a very good price.  After shopping for a DVD player this Christmas, I stumbled upon a great deal for the Sony DSC-S70. 

The cost was $299 at a JC Penney outlet store.  This of course compares to the lowest internet price that I have seen which was in the $600 range.  There were four there, and they were all in unopened boxes.  If you have a JC Penney outlet store nearby, I would suggest checking it out.  

Positives:
The camera itself is a great performer for its price and takes very clear pictures that do not have a grainy texture.  Movement of course does cause blur, but it is not as bad as what I have experienced previously.  

Video use on the camera is also excellent, and the sound quality of the clips is surprisingly good.  

The body is plastic, but the lense has a metal casing that could really help for those moments of an accidental drop.  

The programming feature is nice, and the lcd as well as the top reader provides status of camera. 

A major plus for me on this camera is the view finder.  I have had two other digital cameras that did not have a focus adjustment, and it was difficult to determine if the picture was going to be clear or not.  Sometimes the little things can make a great difference.  

Connecting the camera to both a Mac and  a PC was very simple, and the software that comes with the camera is very good with a wide variety of features.


Negatives:
I have noticed that low light situations are a problem, and the camera can take some off color pictures.  When in doubt, turn on the flash and leave it on. 

Using the menu disc dial can be nerve racking.  On some occasions it is necessary to push the center of the dial, and on others it is necessary to push the dial up or down to engage a command.  Hitting the center just right has been challenging at times.  

This camera has great resolution as other reviewers have noted, but at 1600x1200 the standard 8MB card will only hold 8 pictures.   This camera can go to 2048x1536 which means the standard card could only hold 2 of these files.  Plan on spending $70 or so for a minimum of 64MB of memory.
