            The one thing I have to say about cars in general today is that most cars are designed economical, but with no power whatsoever.  I have to say one more thing.  I don't know who in the world thinks $15000 is economical anyway.  In my opinion, if we have to pay at least that much money for a car, it should number one, last a lifetime, and number two, perform.

The 2002 Monte Carlo fits into this category.  The design is sharp and is unique to any other vehicle on the road.  There are many cars on the road that look the same and half the time you can't tell one from the other, but not the Monte Carlo.  It is sporty looking but unique to it's own.  Inside, it is very comfortable and can come with many optional features, including the On Star Phone system.  The model I bought was the SS version which is the top of the line Monte Carlo.  It was a comfortable ride and drove very smoothly.  The car is also good on gas mileage which is probably about 19 in the city, and 29 on the highway, about the same as the non-supercharged Buick Riviera.  

I only really have one main gripe about the car and that is performance.  Even the SS, top of the line, version of the Monte Carlo, although it has some punch, lacks the performance that most car enthusiasts admire.  It does come with a V6 3800 series, giving the SS version about 200-205 HP.  This vehicle would be a lot more fun to drive if it had a V8 engine like the Cadillac Eldorado that puts out 300 HP.  It would at least be nice if the SS had the supercharged V6 engine giving it 240 HP.  I noticed by looking at the RPM gage, that even slightly pushing down the accelerator is enough to make the SS go above 2500-3000 RPM's, which to me just strain on the engine for not having any power behind it.  The supercharged V6 3800 series, eliminates that strain and keeps the RPM's around 2000 RPM.  Keep in mind that going to 2500-3000 RPM is not a problem, but it's just to show that it puts more strain on the engine than a bigger engine.  With a car as big as the Monte Carlo and as heavy, I think a bigger engine is needed, especially since the car retails with all the options for about $25000.  

For the money, however, this car is worth the buy, and it does have enough power to impress your friends.  If you are an engine enthusiast, however, you will probably have to spend big bucks like about $40,000 to get the power and the same comfort level as the Monte Carlo
