            I am so very proud to be an owner of a new Saturn.  I was a new car &quot;shopper&quot; for well over a year.  I researched via the Internet, and had friends who know more about cars and engines and stuff than I do read up for me as well.  I had decided to purchase a Saturn SL2, which at the time was their top of the line sedan.  Something just kept haunting me to wait.  And in July 1999 Saturn &quot;unveiled&quot; the &quot;next big thing from Saturn.&quot;  Since I'd visited my local retailer several times in the past year, they called me and invited me to the unveiling.  That's when I knew I'd been smart to wait.

I've always had compact cars, most recently a Mitsubishi Mirage.  The Saturn L Series is mid-size.  When I drove the LS1 at the prompting of my sales consultant, it was a hot day when air conditioning was a must.  He had me accelerate onto the freeway with the a/c on because I'd seemed concerned about a 4-cylinder engine on the larger car.  It went beautifully.  Since I had already researched the safety qualities of Saturns, in fact I'd even received insurance quotes, it was easy to make my decision.  I came back home and logged onto their website and went through the motions once again of &quot;building&quot; my new Saturn.  When you do this on their website, you can print out your own window sticker and take it with you to your local dealership.  The window sticker on the original SL2 was less than $500 different from my window sticker on the new LS1.  I could not afford the LS2, which has a v-6 engine, but I'll be able to trade up to that one next time.

Saturn even has a &quot;clinic&quot; for new Saturn owners in which we visited the dealership and had an orientation of sorts into all the details of the warranty, regular maintenance, etc.  We were then shown the inner workings of our cars and were given plenty of time to ask questions.  I must admit that during the part where the car was up on the lift I backed off and let all the gentleman take a look.  It's not like I'll ever have a need to see that side of my car!  For this &quot;clinic&quot;, they provided us with dinner - plenty to eat and drink.  

I love my keepsake calendar, which features a photo of me along with my sales consultant, along with other Saturn team members with my new car.  This calendar is personalized with my name and the date I took possession of the vehicle, and will be refilled each year by my dealership.<br><br>
