            Here are some reasons why to buy this vehicle: Great body molding, Very fast which can be dangerous, Great saftey results, comfort is an all around high, handling is excelent, with the ECS which can change your suspension from &quot;Tour&quot; meaning that the suspension isnt very stiff as if you were to click on &quot;Sport&quot; meaning it has very stiff suspension good for racing and on need sharp turns and on the highway its only a push of a button and its like having a different suspension, interior is beatiful with leather bucket seats in back and very comfortable seats in front, under the hood you have a 3.0L V6, not a great car to put a baby seat in the back or have children in the back, this car is mostly for the ages between 19-50, this car is unbeliveble and is VERY FUN to drive, also this car turns heads! Also this car WILL beat the Acura Integra (all models) Has been street tested.(leagal testing) To answer the questions &quot;The Batmobile or Daddys sports car&quot; Its both nice body molding, and is very fast but can be for all ages.<br><br>
