            I have a friend who bought a 1997 Nissan Maxima.  It is white with a gray interior.  It is equipped with power windows, power driver�s seat, cruise control, AM/FM stereo with tape player, air conditioning, power steering and power brakes.  It also has a remote entry/alarm system and trunk release.

My friend has been out of town and asked me to drive the car to keep the battery up and so forth.  My everyday car is a 1964 Falcon convertible that has a 1995 Mustang GT engine and automatic overdrive transmission, so I was not expecting the Maxima to be much fun.  In fact I thought it would be a dog.  Well, I was wrong!  It was not in the same league as my Falcon, which gives Camaros and Trans Ams a good run (Mustangs are no contest except Cobras), but it is surprisingly quick.  I have been driving the car for about a month now, off and on, and I have to say I enjoy the Maxima very much.  

The drivability of this car is very good.  I don�t notice any torque steer at all and that surprises me, as I must admit I was expecting it.  Even on hard acceleration there is none that I feel.  The brakes are very good, even in the rain, which surprises me as well with the car being fairly light.  The road noise is at a minimum and there is virtually no wind noise.

The cruise control is possibly the best I have ever experienced.  When the set button is pushed, the cruise takes over and keeps the car exactly at the speed the car was going when you push the button.  It doesn�t drop 1 or 2 MPH before engaging like many other cruise controls I have used.  The Resume/Accel button when pushed provides almost immediate acceleration.  The car will even downshift if needed to get up to speed.  Very responsive. Additionally, the Accel button when momentarily pushed while the cruise is engaged, will bump up the speed about 1 MPH.  The coast will lower the speed about 1 MPH.  Very handy.

Another surprise is the gas mileage, which was about 24MPG on the highway.  I was expecting more, I don�t know why, I guess because my Falcon gets about that on the highway as well.  

In summary, I think the Maxima is a very good family car, even though it is far from exciting.  It is fun to drive and the power and handling is more than adequate.
