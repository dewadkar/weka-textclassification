            My daughter and I purchsed a Saturn because it was American Made. The major problem we had with this case was with the breaks.  From the first week we had the car they squeaked.  On several occasions they made such a grinding sound, I pulled the car over and had it towed to the Saturn dealership in Hadley MA.  They found nothing wrong with the breaks. I never felt safe in the car with the way the breaks felt and sounded.  Every time I took the car in for scheduled maintenance, I complained about the break noise and feel. They never found anything wrong with the breaks.  

Then the service engine light came on repeatedly. I would bring in the car for service and they could find nothing wrong.  I took the car to another more local mechanic (It was an hour drive to the Saturn dealership) Naps Auto in Greenfield.  They put it on their computer and found a lot wrong with the car, over $3,000 worth of service that should have been done, covered under the new car warranty.  Also, there were computer updates in the car that should have been done and were never done.  I spent $20 for the test, and got about 7 pages of updates and repairs that needed to be done.  

We sold the car and bought a 2000 Honda CRV, which has more pep, better driving control, the breaking system feels 100% safer, and the maintenance people there don't treat me like an idiot!!!  

I would never buy another Saturn because of the way I was treated by the Service Department.  Numerous calls to the Saturn 800# got absolutely no results. Dealing with that service department was not like the TV ads!  I felt because I was a woman, they treated me like I didn't know what I was talking about.  

My father was a mechanic, and I grew up working on cars.  I know when a breaking system is not working correctly!<br><br>
