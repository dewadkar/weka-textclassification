            It finally came time for my precious graduation gift, the '88 LE Camry my parents had given me, to be put away. The engine blew out (of course I had forgotten to change the oil, otherwise I'd probably still be on the road today with it) so I went shopping at the local Toyota dealership with low expectations. My part time job doesn't afford much in the way of a high budget for car payments.

 I was relatively surprised to find an affordable Corolla, dark green, with CD player, automatic drive, and basic luxuries for only 10,500. With a bit of haggling and my trade in, the price came down to only 7,000. Even though there was a problem with the engine seal about a month after I got the car, Toyota fixed it for me, no cost and it's working fabulously now! I love my car and the payments are only about 190 a month.I can see, even though I've only owned this car about 4 months, that we're going to get along famously.

 I won't ever own another brand of car. Corolla all the way. This car handles great, has 2 airbags, it's not at all hard to control or accelerate. This is a perfect vehicle for new drivers and older drivers not looking to spend a great deal of money but still expecting a great deal of quality. My final word? Corollas are a great value, they look sporty, insurance doesn't go up dramatically because of them (and I'm only 18!), and I'm proud to own one.<br><br>
