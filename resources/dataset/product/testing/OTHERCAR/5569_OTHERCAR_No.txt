            I was in a jam to buy a car, and the used Swift was available on the lot, at a price that appeared reasonable at the time.  It also looked like the Ford Aspire (in some ways, it's basically the same car).  So I bought it.  It did not quite last all the way home before a knob fell off the dash.  After that, the headlight switch broke (which required three days in the shop and opening the steering column), the exhaust needed replacing three times in thirty-one months (and the exhaust-pipe-and-muffler are one unit; this could be expensive), and the air-conditioning unit blew out a second time after I had had it repaired two weeks previously.  After that, I purposely gave up on repairing it to give me an excuse to replace it, and did so within sixty days of that last repair.  The most telling memory I have of this car is the mechanic who broke a part when he was attempting to install it, and we shook our heads together in disbelief.  This car is made of cardboard.  Stay away.<br><br>
