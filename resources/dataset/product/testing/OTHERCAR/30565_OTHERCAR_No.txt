                When I first saw this vehicle under SUV, At epinions.com I laughed. This car is far from a suv, Honda does not really even consider it a SUV they titled it "A family adventure vehicle". First of all Although this vechicle is a descent car It should not be considered a SUV compared to the newest SUV's from others such as GMC, Chevrolet, BMW, and even Porsches new Chyenne is more of a SUV that this Honda. But for normal winter weather and any weather this car will do the trick but this is no car to take off-roading    
    With that said lets get started, the pros of this car. When I first looked at the car I thought it was neat looking it reminded me of the Mercedes ML class of SUV's even though I read reviews from epinons.com and across teh net that most thought the exterior of the vehicle was "blah" or did not have any character I really like the exterior. But its all in opinon, with Honda's saftey record. They might of sacrificed some looks for better strucutre of the car either way its your choice on what you think about the extrioer of the car I liked it. From there it is the interoior we will start with the engine at 240 hp and a V6 it is powerful enough to handel most terrain. Also with hondas innovative AWD system it makes the guts of the car so much nicer. Now for the interior, the car inside is nice with 3 rows of seat that can easily be folded down and also the wideness of teh car and according to other reviews it is wider than most other SUV's even the Chevrolet Trailblazer so for you big and tall there should not be a problem as for the consol in the car it is also very nice lots of storage for all those "family adventures".
    Now for the cons, there werent many maybe one or two that I can think of. But these were BIG problems. The first one would have to be the steering. The steering as far as SUVs go is not good it feels like a 18 wheeler the steering power really lags. Also the suspension in this adventure vehicle is not quite figured out it is not as smooth as a ride as it could be. The steering and suspension deffiently does not match up to the the interior and the powerful 240 hp V6 engine. 
   Overall, for 33k that is fully loaded with the superior audio, dvd, and gps, and leather. I think I could find better but if you are looking for that "family adventure vehicle" this is the ride for you.
