            Audi's A4 has been a runaway bestseller, catapulting Audi sales to previously unknown heights and with good reason. The new Audi A4 abolished any of my previous suspicions about Audi and is not only a great machine, but also a great value. It was terribly difficult for me not to purchase a new A4 Quattro when looking for a new car.

The new A4 chassis is solid and the base of several new Audi/VW cars, but the A4 is no Passat with an expensive badge. Audi's attention to detail in construction is evident from the excellent paint cover to the subtle 'whump' when any doors close. The 1.8T and 2.8 engines which also appear in other Audi/VW cars are superbly engineered engines that are willing to be pressed and provide decent power response. The most obvious feature of this car is that is looks good - actually it looks beautiful yet unpretentious. There are no flares, no wild angles, or any other particular feature; instead it is a classic body style that has very carefully designed angles and proportions that produce a great look. The cars I have driven were all 5-speed and the Audi manual shifter is one of the best I've ever driven. It is almost spooky how difficult it is to miss a gear. The acceleration was nothing spectacular but the car steadily accelerates to desired speed and beyond. The Turbo adds a nice 'whirr' to the overall engine sound, but there was a noticeable turbo lag when pressing the engine. The most remarkable aspect of this car is the Quattro handling - it is fightening how well it works. Some of the finest sports cars in the world are quattro and with good reason. To find such technology in a smaller sedan attests to Audi's dedication to this feature. This car turns, corners, and even just lane-changes with marked surefootedness. Though your mind expects the car to lurch and dip, you will note that your body will not as the car automatically compensates. So, though the car is slower than others in its class for acceleration, when encountering turns and a less-than-straight piece of asphalt, the A4 has been shown to perform better, but moreover, you feel like you are more in control at higher speeds. The interior styling appeals to some, but looks a little cheap and less well designed than a BMW or Honda, but it is very unique if that's what you like. The front seats are well-positioned and comfortable; however, the back seats leave something to be desired. The rear doors are humorously small and open at nearly 90 degrees out from the body; the back seats are not nearly as comfortable especially if there is a large driver. For a price starting around $26,000, the car comes loaded with most all amenities except a moonroof, making it quite a value for its class. The sub-$1000 Sport Package is a MUST-HAVE bargain option that provides nicer wheels and a stiffer suspension. For the less I-need-speed-now oriented performance/luxury/practical auto shopper, this car is a no-brainer unless you prefer racier styling. 

So why wouldn't you buy an A4? - a friend of mine declined to purchase one because she couldn't fit a baby carrier easily into the back seat and so purchased a Passat which has much more room - she loved the design, but didn't care too much for the performance aspects of the A4. The price difference between the 1.8T and 2.8 is also non-trivial, and I prefer the 2.8 - a mechanic told me that turbos are also bound to be more difficult and expensive to fix IF problems occur. However, A4s come with 3 year warranty that covers most everything except gas and tires. For others, the exterior styling is nice, but not racy enough. 

I highly recommend this car for anyone looking for entry-luxury/practical yet technically superb vehicle. Its pricing makes it very attractive to many drivers who could otherwise not afford cars in its class. I do highly recommend Quattro and the sport package, as without them, the car is a different bird altogether. You have to drive this car to appreciate how well it moves. 

I have to admit that after much difficult consideration, I purchased a BMW 323i, but whenever a see an A4, I wish I could have bought both.

For those who want performance with the A4's beauty, watch for the 2000 Audi S4 - absolutely blistering performance in a beautiful package - this is likely to give the new E46 M3 a run for its money.<br><br>
