                 So I finally graduated from college and got a real job.  It was time to get rid of my ailing 1990 Buick Century, and I couldn't have been happier.  I started my search for the perfect car for me and looked everywhere.  But I just kept coming back to that hot little Accord Coupe.  I found a used 2003 at a local dealer.  The previous owner just decided he wanted a true sports car after a few months and a few thousand miles, so I lucked out.  After hearing nothing but good things about owning Honda, I decided to go for it and bought my first car and I couldn't be happier.  I'll give you a little run down of what makes this car a great buy.

~Exterior~
     It's always good to start with the superficial stuff.  I have to say that the new Accord body style is just gorgeous.  It's sleak and sexy (especially my black coupe with the spoiler).  I would say that it would be a great car for a man or a woman (a lot of those cute cars look too feminine for guys  or too masculine for women in my opinion).  
     They do not offer a ton of color options, but the ones they do have are pretty nice looking depending on your taste.  Each color as a pearl essence to it, so it really shines and looks a little different in the sun.  The basic colors (without their fancy names) are black, white, silver, green, blue, graphite,red, and a mix of white/silver.
     As for accessories, there are several wheel options, none of which are spectacular if you ask me.  I have the basic ones that come with the EX and they are decent but nothing too fancy or shiny.  I also have the spoiler and love it.  It's not super high like some of the crazy wings out there, but it really adds some sportiness and fun.  The moon roof is a great addition and it comes standard on the EX (the LX is a very stripped down version with nothing fun on it).    They offer a moonroof visor, nose masks, fog lights, wheel locks, car cover, splash guards, and gold emblems (instead of the standard silver).  
     They also offer a door visor, which is something I am thinking about looking into.  The design of the door and window allows alot of water to get into the car when it is wet.  Even if you want a little fresh air when the car is dewey, it just comes pouring into the window.  I have to carry a towel with me in case I need to open the window.  It's been my only major complaint thus far, so that's not too shabby.

~Interior~
     I looked at cars with both cloth and leather, but finally chose the leather.  The black, silver, blue, and graphite colored cars come with black interior, while the red, white, green and metallic come with "ivory" interior.  The ivory looks more tan if you ask me and isn't too pleasing to my eye, but others may enjoy it.  It looks a little "cheap" in the cloth, but of course does look a bit better in leather.  The black is great in cloth or leather, but I am loving my leather seats.  The doors are also covered in leather and look great with the touches of silver on the console and stereo area.  The leather seats have a warmer in them for those cold mornings.
     Now, I am a fairly tall (5'8"-ish) and a little bigger boned (not telling that!) so I need my space to be comfortable.  There is plenty of leg, head and elbow room for me.  The seats are very comfortable, even for a long car ride.  My 6'3" grandfather sat in the back seat and he even had a decent amount of room.  The stereo is greatly improved from Honda stereos of the past.  The EX came standard with a 6 disc changer and a really good sound.  The stereo has great bass and various controls to change the sound.  There is also volume and channel change controls on the steering wheel, so you don't have to fumble around while driving.  There is also dual climate control so the passenger can pick there own temperature (really convenient for those that are cold-blooded and I've got the A/C cranked).  They do offer several accessories including different trims, floor mats, cassette player, mp3 player, cargo net and leather steering wheel cover.

~Performance~
     I have the 4 cylinder, since the V6 is far too expensive in my opinion.  But they each have 4 valves per cylinder.  I don't know much about engines, but I know that my car has great pick up and far surpasses my old V6.  The anti-lock brakes really work well, especially during those quick freeway stops.  The gas mileage is great.  If I remember correctly, it's 32 highway miles a gallon and 28 city miles a gallon.  To put it in perspective, I took a 7 1/2 hour trip to see my best friend in the mountains of eastern South Carolina and used about a tank and a quarter of gas each way.  Not bad having to fill up twice during the whole round trip.  It also handled great on those mountain curves.  It's a smooth quiet ride.  My friends said I was putting them to sleep with how smooth the ride was.  It's a great car and I couldn't be more proud and happy with it.  Get out there and check it out!

Thanks for reading!  :)
