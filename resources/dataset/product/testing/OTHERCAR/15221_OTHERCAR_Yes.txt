            We chose the Toyota Sienna because of safety.  After looking at all the information available and comparing all the features.  We chose the 2000 Sienna.  At the time of purchase we were driving a 1999 Oldsmobile Silhouette, which had had a few problems.  And even though we lost some space in the back (the Olds was an extended model and the Sienna is not) we feel that the only choice in mini vans is the Toyota.  Our family is too valuable to lose.  Please remember that SAFETY is (and always should be) no. 1.  We will purchase our next vehicle from Toyota.<br><br>
