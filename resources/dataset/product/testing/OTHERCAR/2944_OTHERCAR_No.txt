            Nice car, fair ride, could be tighter though this is for an LS. The base engine keeps up with the GS-R fairly well, and with a Jackson supercharger or Greddy turbo, destroys it. 

Problem with the car is all of the cheap vinyl and plastic. The hatch rattles in the cold, as well as the sunroof. Some minor creaks as well due to all of the plastic on top of plastic parts. If Acura replaced the interior with more cloth items (such as the roof lining and sunroof visor, it would be 100 times better. The interior is just cheap. 

The engine is excellent, revs well, has almost the same torque as the GS-R, -3lbs I believe, and the manual tranny is also smooth. Shifting is good, and not really made any better by using Redline MTL. It's just flat out a good shifting car, synchros are defintely well made. Clutch is a little light (I'm used to most of my previous VWs, including my Scirocco).

Stock tires must go. They are a road hazard. Get some Dunlop 5000 Asymetrics. Cars under 3k lbs don't belong on Michelins IMO. Yokohamas and Dunlops are the best for light imports. I've even tried the Mich Pilot XGTs, and they weren't much better than stock on this car.

Bottom line, after two of these cars, 1999 and a 2000, I am still disappointed in the interior quality. The next machine will probably be the Lexus IS300, though I still don't like the clear tailights.......
