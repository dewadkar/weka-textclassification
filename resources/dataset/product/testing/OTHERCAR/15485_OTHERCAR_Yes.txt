            We searched out information on digital cameras until we discovered just how ignorant we were. The more I learned about digital cameras the less I seemed to know. Flash memory, pixels, optical and digital zoom .. It just got to be too much. Digital cameras are expensive to start with. all the fancies on them just seemed to add to the price and I still was not sure what they did.

Ultimately, we looked at features we understood vs price. We wanted an internal flash, auto focus and something easy enough for use to figure out. When we priced some of the other less expensive cameras, we noticed that the photo storage capabilities were limited to a flash card. These cards required me to download the pictures to a computer in order to keep them and then reuse the card. That meant I had to take my laptop with me everywhere i went OR I had to buy more of the cards. Those things are expensive!

We finally settled on the Sony Mavica FD88. It has an 8x Optical zoom and up to a 16x Digital zoom. It is auto focusing and has a built in flash. After playing with it for a few minutes, I was able to figure out how to use most of the functions. (Being a man, I did not read the instructions until later. My favorite feature about the camera is its ability to record a mpeg video.

The coolest thing though is it stores ALL the photos and mpeg files on a 3 1/2 floppy disk. For a few bucks I can buy a BOX of disks and have a virtual unlimited amount of &quot;film&quot;. And when I am ready, all I have to do is pop in the floppy disk to see the picture. No download or cords or special programs. I can use any computer that accepts a 3 1/2&quot; floppy!
