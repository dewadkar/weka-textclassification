            I purchased a Polaroid 640CF a few months ago. This is slightly different from the model listed, but not much. This camera came with 2 MB internal memory, a case, both a serial and a USB cable, batteries, software, and an AC adapter. I paid $150 for the camera at Wal-Mart, and on the same day purchased a 32 MB Flash Memory card ($40) and four rechargeable AA batteries. Note that this is a different memory card than is used by the model 640 - be sure to pay attention if you want to buy extra memory. I had to actually open the camera package and read the user manual to find out what to buy.

Learning to use the camera was easy, but I am a computer programmer/web site developer so my opinion in this area may not mean much. I use the serial cable to connect the camera to my computer because I couldn't seem to get the USB cable to work. I did not try for very long, however, I just went with the path of least resistance and used the first cable that worked.

I took this camera to Utah on a vacation and really liked being able to see the photos right away and know that I got what I wanted. In the intense desert sunlight, it was often very difficult to see the display. At the end of each day I downloaded the photos to my laptop computer with the serial cable and recharged the AA batteries, so I never had problems with running out of power or memory.

If you would like to see some photos taken with this camera, you may visit my Web site here:  

One thing I did discover is that close-up shots were almost always out of focus. I tried to get some photos of flowers, and any subject within three feet of the camera was blurry. But for most of my needs, I was very satisfied with this camera. Many reviewers have complained of a long warm up time with this camera, and I did not find this to be true unless I was using the flash.

For those of you who do not read the directions, take note of the fact that after you take a photo, the camera prompts you to hit a button if you want to save it right away (I had a hard time seeing this in the bright sunlight). If you do not answer the prompt, the photo will be saved in about four seconds. That works fine, unless the photo happens to be the last one you are taking before putting the camera away in your backpack and you close the lens cover before the four seconds have elapsed. Duh, I lost a lot of photos the first few days by doing that.

Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a starter digital camera who does not need to take close up shots. One big disadvantage compared to the Sony Mavica (besides image quality) is that these photos can only be removed from the camera by a computer with the Polaroid software installed. In other words, you can't just take the photos, pop out a diskette, and hand it over to a friend. But, after I downloaded them onto my laptop, I saved them to diskette and was able to share them.

This camera feels cheap, but my nephew dropped it on the floor and it survived, so perhaps looks are deceiving.
