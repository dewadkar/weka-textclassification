            For years I've been looking for the perfect hybrid car/SUV vehicle, one with all the virtues of both and the disadvantages of neither.  Only one vehicle, the 2000 Subaru Outback Limited, has come close enough to that admittedly impossible requirement to merit comment.  I purchased an Outback Limited in late 1999 and have driven it about 15,000 miles across North America in most climatic zones and terrains during the past 9 or 10 months.  It's stability under virtually all driving and road conditions is truly outstanding, acceleration is good, driver and passenger comfort is excellent in front seats, good in the rear for two (fair for three), and the amenities are first-rate (CD player and sound system; automatically darkening rear-view mirror; heated seats/mirrors/windshield-wipers; etc.  The &quot;options list&quot; contains no silly junk, and the car's major features (driving quality, safety, performance, economy, comfort, dependability, etc.) are beyond what would reasonably be expected of a car in the upper-2Os price range.  The only downside is the fact that Subaru dealerships are scarce in some parts of the U.S.-- an inconvenience when routine maintenance is required during long cross-country trips.  In sum, the 200 Subaru Outback Limited is a top-flight hybrid car/wagon/SUV vehicle.    <br><br>
