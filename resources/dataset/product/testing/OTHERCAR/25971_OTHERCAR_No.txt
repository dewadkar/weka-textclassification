            My husband came home all excited because with his father's GM discount we could actually afford a brand new Cavalier.  He bugged me about it until I went to the dealer to test drive the thing.

My first impression was that it looked much better in the brochure.  I was so SMALL.  My kids in the back seat were wiggling around (as usual) and they kept bumping into my seat.

I hardly demand the top of the line anything, but the interior looked incredibly cheap.  I turned on the windshield wipers and it felt as it the lever would break off with any amount of pressure.

The sound the engine made when I gave it some gas reminded me of a go-cart. The four cylinder engine had very little pick up to it.

I couldn't see spending the money for a brand new Cavalier, when the same amount of money would buy a nicer model used car.<br><br>
