            The Fuji Finepix 4900 Zoom is for the most part excellent. The zoom works well,and doesn't consume a lot of battery reserves. The camera is so light you forget it is around your neck. The resolution of the finished product is excellent, as one would expect from a fine company like Fuji. The cold doesn't seem to bother it, I have used it in -20, -30, with no problems except cold fingers.

I only have two negative remarks,and there is probably nothing that can be done to fix them
First is the viewfinder when being used out of doors. I do a lot of action photography and it can be very difficult in bright sun to locate the subject in the viewfinder. Nothing like using a 35mm viewfinder. Usually in bright weather one wears sun glasses. The Fuji viewfinder is impossible to use with sun glasses, so you must take off the glasses and now try to look through a viewfinder with eyes that are accustomed to sun glasses.
Second, is the time it takes to record a picture. I shoot at 1600 Normal. When I have a deer or a coyote running towards me in an open field I will take a shot at about 50 yards and I am lucky to get a second shot off before I am shooting it going away from me. I will get perhaps two more shots going away. It can take all day to get in position for these four shots. It would be nice if Fuji could put in some sort of processor to speed things up.
