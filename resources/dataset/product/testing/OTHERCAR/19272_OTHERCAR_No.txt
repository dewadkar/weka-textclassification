            My husband and I currently have this car leased and we hate it.  Originally we leased this vehicle to trade another leased vehicle in that was damaged.  A big mistake!  

Imagine first driving a car that downshifts quickly while you are in traffic.  You are coasting at fifty miles per hour and suddenly everyone in front of you stops.  You are forced to stop in a car that jerks at twenty miles per hour.  Plus when the cars continue you travel twenty to thirty miles per hour, but when you start slowing down to twenty again, JERK, into the seat belt.  

Second, imagine that you are the passenger of a car that downshifts quickly, jerk, jerk, jerk.

Let me add that the car we have has an automatic transmission.

Then, because you know that there is something wrong with your piece of metal, you take it in to the dealership, but lo and behold, they can't find anything wrong with it.  Yes, it downshifts fast, but there is nothing that can be done.

There have also been other problems that we have encountered with this car...

Imagine, you driving around in the summer in Orlando, Florida in a business suit and suddenly your air conditioner stops working.  You play with all of the knobs and buttons that your car has and nothing works.  You are destined to sweat through your work clothes.  Again, to the car dealership where while they are driving your car the air works perfectly, it must just be my bad luck?  

For a car that doesn't work all that well, the price isn't worth it.  You are better off spending the same amount of money for a higher quality car, try Volkswagen.

Good luck on your car buying adventure.<br><br>
