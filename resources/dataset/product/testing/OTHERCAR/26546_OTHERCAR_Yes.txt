            I read many reviews of small pickups.  The reviews included Chevrolet S-10, Ford Ranger, and Dodge Dakota.  For me it was a choice between these three trucks.  Actually, I think there were more positive reviews written for the Ford Ranger and the Dodge Dakota.  My next step after reading the reviews on my computer was to go test drive the vehicles.  I did not especially like driving the Ford Ranger (I do own and love my Mustang). I liked driving the Chevrolet S-10.  It seemed, however, to lack power on acceleration.  The Dodge Dakota was an attractive truck to me and it drove excellent.  So why did I choose to buy the S-10?  Well here are my reasons, and, after 2000 miles, I am still glad I made the decision to buy the Chevrolet.  First factor in my decision making was, I wanted a truck that would give me a good gas mileage.  To get that, I chose a 4 cylinder.  I am pleased because I get 22 to 30 miles per gallon. 

The Dodge Dakota that I liked was a V6--I just did not like the 4 cylinder Dodge, therefore, the Chevrolet 4 cylinder, which I did like, would get me good gas mileage. I like the visual appeal of the Chevrolet, and I think it will have a better resale value than the Dodge Dakota.

The one aspect that I do not like about my S-10 is the lack of power during acceleration on take offs and going up hills--it gets there okay but one must put the accelerator to the floor and the motor races and seemingly strains.  Despite this lack of power, I enjoy my S-10 and am pleased with my decision because I get an acceptable gas mileage.

This is not my only vehicle.  If it were, I probably would not be satisfied with it.  I use it for going to work, around town driving, hauling, etc.  For real pleasure, I drive my powerful V8 Mustang convertible.<br><br>
