            I have had my Toyota Tacoma 4X4 extra cab for about 2 yrs and let me just say I love this truck almost as much as my wife.  It's smooth highway ride and ruggedness when off-roading give you the best of two totally different worlds.  We drove this truck across country from Michigan to Northern California with absolutely no problems and in total comfort.  This truck has also battled the Sierra Nevada mountains in the snow and off road.  The compact design of this truck makes it a lot more sporty when driving through town unlike a lumbering full size truck.  The extra cab design is one of the most spacious I have seen in this class of truck.  It easily seat 4 people on a long trip in complete comfort.  I would definitely advise anyone to invest in a Toyota.    <br><br>
