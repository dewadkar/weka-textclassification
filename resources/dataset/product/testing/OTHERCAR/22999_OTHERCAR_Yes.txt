            I purchased this camera last Thanksgiving in anticipation of Christmas.  We took lots of pictures to send to family out of state.  They loved them.  

This camera is great for emailing friends and family pictures.  I use this mainly for sending pictures of my baby to family to keep them updated on his growth and milestones.  It is also great for webpage entries.

The main drawback I find with this camera is that the photos don't print out to well.  If you stay very small they are OK, but if you go larger then a wallet size they look distorted and blurred.  Another drawback is that the object has to stay still to be photographed unlike with a 35mm camera.

If you plan on mainly using this for emailing photos or doing webpages, this is a great deal.  If you want a digital for and all around camera I would recommend you getting a much more expensive model with more pixels.<br><br>
