            I have owned my 95' Altima SE for about 6 years now and could not have made a better choice (bought it used, when it was 2 yrs. old).  I needed a vehicle that could offer the versatility of being truly USEFUL yet still sporty and fun to drive.  My model (the SE) has the full-deal of leather seats, sunroof, spoiler and all the amenities.  I have had to pay for no major repairs since I have owned it until this last year; when it has begun to need some replacement of items like the fuel filter, CV joint, brake calipers, secondary thermostat sensor, and heating/air vent fan motor.  All of the small repars have run from $50 to $200 at maximum including labor.

This car has been a gem to own.  I have been rear-ended twice and returned the favor (fortunately only once) to another individual.  Both times, my Altima came through like a champ.  Bumper damage only - and boy do these bumpers soak up an impact.  I have even slid in the rain into a cement median at about 40mph and sustained not a scratch while regaining control of the vehicle.  The suspension definitely feels the road, but I like to feel in touch with what I am driving on.  Visibility for changing lanes is excellent through the four-door sedan windows.  Steering is responsive and not spongy.  Road noise is evident but not bothersome.  The trunk does leak occasionally.  I live in Atlanta, and the general 85mph highways here are demanding of a vehicle, I can be travelling at 75 and still get a great jump should I need acceleration.  It's brought me to 140,000 miles thus far and is still going strong!  I imagine I'll be replacing it with another Nissan in a year or two!
