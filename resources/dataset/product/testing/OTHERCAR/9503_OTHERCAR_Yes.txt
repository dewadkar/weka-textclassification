            We bought a 2000 Dodge as a replacement for a 97 Dodge.  To save money we did not get the LS package.  I now wish that we had spent the extra $1000.00.  Our old truck was an LS (power locks and windows, special trim, bed liner, and lots of little things).  I'm not saying our new truck is not nice - I LOVE it - but I miss my extras.  This is not a truck for someone who does a lot of driving.  It tends to guzzle gas (I average 15 mpg) and it takes almost $30.00 to fill it up.  One of my favorite things is the feeling of being above everyone else that it gives my as it is a 4x4.  At 5'3&quot; it is nice to be taller than everyone else for a change. <br><br>
