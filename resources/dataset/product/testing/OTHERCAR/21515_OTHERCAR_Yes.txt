            I bought this vehicle after seeing it in the streets of Spain in the summer of 99. I totally fell in love with it. I had never seen it in America before then, so as soon as I got home I went out and bought it. I have never had any complaints about this car. I always get compliments for it, which is very nice.

I love the car's looks and the performance is not bad. If you want a bit more performance go ahead and get the GTI. I couldn't get the GTI myself because I can't drive stickshift (I wish someone would take some time to teach me) so the GLS was the only option.

As the title says, the only problem I've had, and this has happened to several VW owners I know; is that sometimes some buttons stay depressed indefinitely. For example, the emergency flashing light button on my Golf stays and I have to hit it for a couple of minutes before it'll let go. Aside from that, I love my car, and if I lost it I would probably buy the same one again. What more can I say?<br><br>
