            There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to get a Canon Powershot.  The Sleek Design, automatically lens cover, and Canon's reputation for great lenses were amongst my reasoning.  The question was "What is more important? Price, Size, or Resolution?"

Will I pay close to $550 to obtain the smallest 3.3 megapixel camera, or will I pay $500 for obtain the smallest 2.11 megapixel camera (and I mean small!).  OR, will I pay $385 to get something in between?

Although I'm not a avid photographer, picture quality was my top priority.  However, after examining the pictures taken by the S20 and the S10, other than the larger resolution, I do not see a degrade in picture quality.  Because I have no need for any resolution larger than 1600X1200.  Other than the added megapixels, the S20 and S10 is identical.  Because of this, my choice was further narrowed down to the S100 and S20.

The S100 is definately a neat toy to have around.  However, the first disadvantage comes because it doesn't use Type II CompactFlash memory, so the IBM Microdrive is not an option.  Second, because of it's size, the LCD is also smaller.  Other accomadations that were made for the size is the smaller lens.  Just because both the S10 and S100 are 2.11 megapixel cameras, doesn't mean their picture quality is identical.  After reading several reviews, I was determined that the S100 pictures were no where near the quality of the S10.  Lastly, several features and functions that are on the S10 are not on the S100, and the display on the S100 is harder to follow.

So what if it's a little bigger?  The S10 packs more punch for less money.  Just make sure you get the DK-110 recharger set and an extra battery and I guarantee that you'll fall in love with this PowerShot S10 just as I have.  And with the extra money you've saved, treat yourself to a nice meal at your nearest steak house.
