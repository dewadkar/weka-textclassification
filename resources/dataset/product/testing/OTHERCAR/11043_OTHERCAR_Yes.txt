            After over a year worth of research and with one new addition to the family, we finally caved and bought a mini-van for more much needed room and convenience.  We were seriously looking at the Honda Odyssey simply because of its popularity and outstanding reviews, but were turned off by the price and cocky sales people.  Also found the size to be a bit more than what we actually needed especially when looking for something that was easy to drive around and park in tight places in and around the city.  Once we came across the new and improved Mazda MPV 2002 (with 5 speed transmission and 200 Horse power engine)and its price, the choice was obvious.

QUALITY & VALUE:
When researching the new 2002 Mazda MPV and recent reviews of the post 2000 MPVs, I discovered that Mazda had so much more to offer over the Odyssey in the area of price/feature ratio and without sacrificing safety or quality (MPV 2002 fleet is still manufactured in Japan).

SIZE:
Yes, statistically the MPV is a smaller vehicle than the Odyssey, but when it comes down to loading it with the same amount of adults or a family of 2 adults and 1-2 children, you'll find that you really don't need the extra bulk to try to cart around the city in or try to parallel park in.  It really does park like a car!  I highly recommend those who test drive this vehicle to do a parallel parking test,  you'll be impressed on how similar it is to a car.

FEATURES:
Mazda has taken some of the great selling/convenience features of the Honda Odyssey and combined it with some of Mazda's exclusives such as the slide down windows on the sliding doors (Very Cool!!! especially for those days when the back passengers don't require air conditioning but would like to enjoy the same fresh outdoor breeze as the front passengers.  Also very handy when people/family outside of the vehicle want to say a few things to the passengers in the rear or even bye bye to the grand kids)

HANDLING:
Those who have driven smaller vehicles (sedans/coupes) will find the transition to this mini-van seamless as it is just as easy to drive and park in any situation as a regular car. My wife was particularly impressed with the manouvrability of this van as the thought of trying to park in some of the tightest spots at the mall was initially a concern.  Acceleration is great with this mini van. Test it out for yourself during a test drive, just remember, a quick and hard press down of the accelerator will spring this vehicle to life when you really need it.  Just make sure that the sales rep sitting in the back is strapped in. 

APPEARANCE:
In terms of sporty appearance, the new 2002 MPV really shines.  We went with the LX with the Sports package which includes the 17" 5 spoke aluminum alloy wheels and the front fog lights.  The slightly redesigned front grill and nose of the vehicle rounds out the entire sporty look.

SOUND SYSTEM:
Well no male mid-life crisis option would be complete without an awesome sounding stereo system.  Mazda put a great 9 speaker system together (included in the sport package on the LX).  Load up the 6 disc CD changer and crank up the sound in order to really appreciate the clarity and power of this system.  The subwoofer really balances out the sound!  I also love the fact that the rear speakers are so conveniently located so that when the 3rd row seat is flipped back to face the rear of the vehicle with the tail gate up, you can enjoy crisp clean music while sitting back and facing a ball game or your picnic/camp site!
