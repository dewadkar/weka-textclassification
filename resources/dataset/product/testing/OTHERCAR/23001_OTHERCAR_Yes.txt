            I received the Polaroid 640 as a gift. I was very excited to have a digital camera that I could use right when I opened it. The Polaroid 640 comes with a 2MB chip to allow instant use, as long as you have 4 AA batteries on hand, which I did. I put in the batteries, opened the camera and began shooting away. 
The first thing I liked about the camera was that there is no need to use the eyehole in order to take a picture. All needs be done is to point the camera in the direction you want to shoot, then just re-aim by looking at the screen until the object you want comes into focus; then just click on the button, wa-la- picture taken.
The second feature I fell in love with was the ability to instantly delete any picture that failed to meet my liking. You simply go to the menu on the camera, delete current, delete now...whammo-it's gone!
Okay, so I filled my camera's memory (using the included 2MB chip, I was able to hold 24 pictures using the medium setting). Now it was time to download them to my computer.
I put the included CDROM into my drive and clicked install. The Polaroid PhotoMax installed very simply. I attatched my camera to the media cable which is hooked into a parallel port on my computer (also included) and tried to download my pictures. No avail. I redid the entire install of the software, again no avail. So, I called Polaroid...no answer, it was a weekend of course.
For some reason, my camera and parallel port were not working as they should. But there was a quick fix...I ran to the local electronics store and purchased Lexar Media's product (not sure the name). Then I just removed my camera's 2MB card, inserted it into Lexar Media cable and there, my pictures downloaded.
Now for a fun feature, I connected the camera to my TV's video input jack, and was able to see my pictures on the television screen, I recorded the screen with my VCR as I scrolled through the pictures. The result, I now have a VHS tape of my holiday pics complete with background music. (which I dubbed in using my stereo as I recorded)!!! That is the neatest feature yet.
All in all. Even though I had problems getting PhotoMax to download my pictures, the camera itself is great.
Plus, Polaroid has a good reputation. (they did call me back the following Monday to offer help).
I would buy this product again.<br><br>
