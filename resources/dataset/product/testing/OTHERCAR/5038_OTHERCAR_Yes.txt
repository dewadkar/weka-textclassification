            My friend bought this beauty (GT model) a couple of months ago and the total cost with every thing on it came to $30,317.00. This is for the Convertible 2-door, V6 with the premium package, leather seats and an automatic transmission. 

The 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder comes in two models. The GS model comes with a 2.4 four-cylinder with 147 horsepower, the GS has 16-inch wheels. The GT model comes with a more powerful V-6 with 200 horsepower and 17-inch wheels. Both models are available with the 5-speed standard transmission with overdrive and a four-speed automatic transmission. The GS price starts at around $23,000 and the GT start at around $25,000.

The Four-speed automatic transmission is an auto/manual transmission, this allows you to down shift like a standard without a clutch. This worked fairly well, I still think a standard is more effective. 

The 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GT is front wheel drive with a gas tank of 16.4 gallons.

<b>The Premium Package </b>
The premium package was an extra $2650.00 and includes the following:
Equipment Plus Traction Control
Dual Front Side Impact Air Bag Restraint System
ABS Anti-Lock Braking System
Leather Front Bucket Seats
Six-Way Power Driver's Seat Adjuster
Infinity AM/FM Stereo with a 6-Disc Compact Disc Changer in Dash.

<b>Performance</b>
The GT comes with a Fuel Induction 24V SFI V6 (3.0 Liters) with 200 hp @ 5500 rpm and a torque of 205 lb.-ft. @ 4000 rpm.

The gas mileage is rated at 19 MPG in the city and 26 MPG on the highway.  Now my friend seems to keep the gas pedal to the floor and the actual mileage he gets is 17.1 MPG in the city and 25.4 MPG on the highway. I believe if it were driven like most people would drive them, it would get about what it is rated at.

Here are some speed tests we have done, these are by no means the most accurate, they are what we have come up with. It went from 0 to 55 MPH in about 6 seconds and from 0 to 75 MPH in about 10 seconds.  Not bad on performance!

<b>Other Specifications </b>
The model my friend had came with dual front air bags and side airbags.
(Side airbags was added from the Premium Package.)

<b>Overall</b>
The car handled great with plenty of power. The ride, well it is like most sports cars, not bad, if you want a smooth ride get a sedan. Cornering the car was no problem at all, it holds the curves nicely.

The doors are plenty wide to get in and out of the front seats, though is it a little uncomfortable when you get in and out of the back seats. Seating up front was fairly comfortable. 

I really liked the layout of the whole interior from the gauges to the way the stereo comes down the center of the dashboard. The leather seats are all right, I just prefer cloth for best all around weather conditions.

If you want a sports car, then I highly recommend the 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GT, my friend loves his.
