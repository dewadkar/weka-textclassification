            its a good car dont get me wrong but it has things that have been warned about like the slowness it has excellent acelleration but not made for speed but should be cinsidered in everyones mind i hope that everyone will look at the century cause everything is worth a shot espcailly the
 
century i cna fit a big 27 inch in the back seat but the seats are very cushioned so they will sink in other than that the car is excellent they should have a real family test it thought to see if its a real family sedan as we all say i looked at the tested safty and its a acceptable in
 
offset but the accord and camry got good not to far way not even that is a a commuter car when it ha a V6 in the engine that has 180 hp in it thats very good but i will have to say its made for people in thier 50-70 something like that u can tell everything is made specaial thats why the quality was a 5 star!!<br><br>
