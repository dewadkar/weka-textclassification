            The Chevrolet Suburban is an awesome vehicle to own.  When we bought it in 1998, we were really happy to have it, for the size and nothing else.  Then, we figured out some other things about it.  It has front and rear control air conditioning, V8 engine,tons of cargo space and more!  We also figured out it had a 42 gallon gas tank, only for one reason, it's a gas hog.  We would re-fill it all the time.  We thought it wouldn't fit in the garage, so make sure it fits before you get one.  They are also very good to have in case of a wreck, too!  They're big and safe for you and your family.  With all of the SUV wars, with cars like the Expedition, Excursion, 4Runner, Land Cruiser,etc, I would definitely choose the Suburban out of every single one.<br><br>
