            I was looking for a camera that I could carry around in my pocket to snap photos whenever I needed to do so.  Ultimately a digital camera built in to a cell phone would be optimal, since my pocket space is limited, but at the moment the quality of photos from phone/camera combos is very weak.

So I decided on a device that did its primary function well.

The Philips Key Chain Cameras seem perfect - good design, solid construction, small size, easy upload - you simply pop off the cap and plug it into the USB drive.  In Windows 2000 or XP the computer recognizes the camera as a removable drive and assigns it a drive letter.  Nice.

The problem with this camera is that the photo quality is awful - worse than some cell phone cameras I've seen.

The resolution is listed as 1.3 megapixels, but the true photo resolution is much much lower than that (about 25% of the claimed resolution) and you need to use the included software to extrapolate the extra resolution.  It sounds like false advertising to me.

But even at the lower resolution this CCD needs a LOT of light to get even a passable photo.  Forget about taking pictures indoors.  Even under very bright fluorescent lighting the photos were underexposed and blocky - very "digital" looking.

I would not recommend this camera even for casual snap shots.  It simply does not work well enough to warrant carrying it.

Instead, I chose the Minolta DiMAGE Xt (see my review there).
