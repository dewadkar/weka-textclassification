            I bought the Polaroid PDC700 at Christmas of 1999.  I sell on ebay so I take hundreds of digital pictures per week and thought this would be a good camera - the price was within my price range and at first the quality of the camera seemed very good. 

About 2 months after I had used it I noticed the coloring was all off in most of my pictures.  It was still under warranty at the store I bought it from so I returned it and exchanged it for another one identical to it, thinking maybe the problem was just a fluke.  Well, the brand new camera I brought home was returned the next day because there was a red dot in the center of all of my pictures.  It was on the LCD screen in the back and it showed up on all of my pictures.  I returned it and exchanged it for another one.  It seemed fine for about a few weeks and the coloring became all discolored on all of my pictures again.  

So... I've now upgraded to a new camera (Hewlett Packard C200) and will not be buying another Polaroid Digital Camera.  Might be ok if you are just going to use it every once in a while but not if you will be using it on a daily basis.  <br><br>
