            Pros: Futuristic styling, V8 power, long list of standards
Cons: Small-feeling interior, poor gas mileage, slow handling.

The Oldsmobile Aurora was introduced as a statement to import manufacturers that America can produce a sleek, refined, high quality sports sedan to compete with their best offerings.  After purchasing a '96 model Aurora, I can attest that they mostly have been successful in accomplishing this task. 

My wife and I have long been impressed by the wicked good looks of the first-generation Aurora (the new model due in 2001 looks fairly generic and hard to distinguish from the rest of the Olds line).  We found a classy model with a black exterior and saddle leather interior and knew this was the one.  Our Aurora turns heads at every stop light, and for this reason I rate it tops in the style category.

Driving leaves something to be desired, however.  I had previously owned a '96 Olds LSS and was elated with its power, poise, and roominess.  Compared to that automobile, the Aurora does not stack up.  The 4.0 liter V8 makes the car fairly quick and powerful, but as a trade-off we usually get pretty poor gas mileage (around 17 in town).  This is unacceptable when the LSS with supercharged V6 matches or exceeds this performance but gets mileage in the mid-20's. Plus, the Aurora is a larger all-around car but its interior room seems to suffer from the more sweeping roofline and large console area.

Another noteworthy shortcoming for this car is its handling.  If feels like a car twice its size, big and bulky.  The driver feels disconnected.  I almost forget if I'm in a sports sedan or a Buick Roadmaster because there's so much body roll.  A car this sporty on the outside should be more fun inside.

The Aurora makes up for this,though, with its impressive amenities.  The driver will find himself surrounded by buttons and gauges, which gives the car the feel of a jet-fighter, almost.  There are auto-dimming mirrors, CD/tape combo, auto air conditioning, heated leather adjustable seats with memory, sunroof, and a cool trip computer that measures everything from fuel range to engine diagnostics.  This is a car that pampers, and the fit and finish quality and reliability are superb.

In summary, then, I would recommend this car to anyone who wants to be noticed and ride in great comfort.  If its sport you are looking for, don't let the cool looks fool you; you should search on.  But for boulevard cruising and long distance commutes, this is the real thing.
