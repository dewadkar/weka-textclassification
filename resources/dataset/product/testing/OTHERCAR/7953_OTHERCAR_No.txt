            Ok I realize that there is alot of redesign in the new wrangler, but at what cost? The ride is alot smoother, but the reliability has suffered. My wife and I both have Jeeps same year make and model, and we have had are share of problems.The front sway bar links have been replaced twice on her jeep and once on mine. Transmission went at 40k, got a new rear axle at 25k, and we just have been informed that the wrist pin in her engine went south, cost 1,500 to repair. Now you may wonder about abuse, I don't think a commute of 50 miles(around trip) into Manhatten and home, (ON pavement) be be abuse.AS for four wheel drive,used it once worked great,but had to bring it to jeep to disengage it cause some pin,or lever got hung up and had to be replaced.Our jeeps are for sale Extended Warranty Include.<br><br>
