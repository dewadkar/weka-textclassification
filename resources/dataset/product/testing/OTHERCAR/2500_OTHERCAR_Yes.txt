            Many car shoppers (especially American) buy a car
and add features "just in case this and that happens".
The SUV is a good example:
# How many times do you really
take that car off road and need the 4WD, when living
in Southern California?
# How many people take their car and at the same time load it with bikes, canoes and dirt bikes?
# How many times do you need a gas hungry V8 when driving on the freeway?
# Does it feel better that when driving your Chevy Suburban and collide with that Mazda Miata, you survive, but the other party will probably die.
OK, enough ranting.

If you nod on my reasoning above, you'll probably
want a small pickup. Consider the Toyota Pickup.
It's a very uncomplicated vehicle, it gives you enough
room to drive home that mattress on sale, or the surfboard to the beach.
The 1986 Toyota Pickup came with a couple of different engines, but I think
the 2.2L 4-cylinder is the most common one.

I've never owned a truck before, I thought it would be very unpractical and
expensive (at least gas). I was wrong.

I've owned my Toyota for 6 months, it had 180.000 miles when I bought it, from the only owner. I've done some work, like replacing the alternator, changing the slave cylinder for the clutch and the usual oil and spark plug change. It's quite a common car, so spare parts are cheap and easy to find.

Also, it's very easy to work under the hood.

Mine is 4 speed, with the 4th gear almost like the fifth on other cars. 4th gear only works above 45 mph.

I don't drive around with heavy loads on the back of the truck, but I still get 28-29 mpg. That's as good as a 2002 Ford Focus (which is a really small car).
Not much innovation in the car industry during the last 16 years.

OK, to the bad side. This car rusts. Not so much in the front, but the box rusts down fast. I've seen other trucks from the 80s, they all have the same problem.
The engine will outrun the body, that's for sure.
Don't buy this truck if you plan on hauling trailers, 30 foot sailboats, or want to chauffeuring around your folks. The engine is not built for that.
