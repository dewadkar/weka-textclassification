                   I bought the Kodak DC215 for taking pictures while traveling to send back home and also to list some items on ebay.  I have found this camera to be excellent in picture clarity and simplicity of use.  The zoom feature is primarily for indoor close up pictures but that does not detract from a normal close up picture taken on a trip. The flash is very efficient and not bright to the point of a white picture like some I have seen. I use a memory card to take advantage of the port on my computer which really prolongs the life of my batteries.  Downloading pictures with a cable does drain batteries.  I am totally satisfied with this camera and I feel the Kodak DC215 is a best buy for the money.    <br><br>
