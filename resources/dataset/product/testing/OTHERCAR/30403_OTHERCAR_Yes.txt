            I have had opportunity to drive this vehicle on a regular basis.  I would recommend it to any family that is looking for lots of room as well as a SAFE ride.  The widetrack build is a great idea and allows for a comfortable ride and stable handling.  I would let my children drive this vehicle it is so exciting and safe.  Also, the design allows for style and functionality at the same time.  The onboard built in cooler and the sliding storage compartment are excellent additions.  With a low starting price, it will surely be a popular vehicle on the road very soon.<br><br>
