            To see my other car troubles, see my review on my 1993 Grand Am.  'Nuff said.

So, I needed a new car.  I am fresh out of college, money in my pocket (FINALLY!) and I am on the hunt for a new car.

I went to the Honda dealership and I was looking at a used Civic.  It was one year old, missing some features I wanted, but I could live with this car.  Then, I noticed I could get a brand new one for $2,000 more.

I went to the new-car side of the lot.  I got into a 2001 Civic EX Coupe.  I loved it immediately.  I bought it that night and drove it off the showroom floor the next afternoon. 

In addition to all of the features on the EX model, I got alloy wheels, a spoiler and floormats.  The end price was $16,200 (plus my trade-in).

What do I love about my car?  Everything!  The sunroof, the interior, the reverse gauges (they are silver in the daytime) the radio with CD player, the gas mileage - absolutely everything.

What do I hate about my car?  Well, I have always had a 6 cylinder.  So, going to a 4 cylinder was tough.  I did get the manual transmission, though, and I notice is a lot faster than my parent's Accord with an automatic transmission.

But I can get over the fast that it is not the fastest car.  It sure is a nice looking car and I know that with the Honda name behind it, it will last me a long time.  

This car is great for those looking for there first brand new car, and who don't have a lot of money.  I financed through my credit union and my payment is only $300.  My insurance prices went up about $10 a month and that's it.  

If you see me on the road, just honk!  ;)
