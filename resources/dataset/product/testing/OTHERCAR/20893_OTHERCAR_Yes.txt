            When I first saw the PT Cruiser in the newspaper, I was totally fascinated.  It was so cool how they took an old gangster looking car from the 1930's, and brought it back to style.  I had to test drive one!  So I went to the Chrysler Dealership, and it was the test drive of a lifetime. 

Although there is a controversy of whether this is a car, a van, or a truck, I don't think it matters.  To own one would definitely be a neat experience.  After test driving the car, I found it to be a nice compact vehicle, with a good amount of storage space.  If you need to carry cargo, the backseats are removable.  I found that to be very convienient for space.  And the price of these cars is not as outrageous as I thought it would be.  You can get one at the starting price of only $16,000.  I found that to be very affordable.  I found that this  vehicle has a very smooth ride.  It was also decent on gas mileage.  

I think that this car would be a good idea for anyone to buy!  And if you can't buy one I think you should at least test drive one.  I feel that everyone should feel the experience of driving a classic car like that, even if it is just one time.<br><br>
