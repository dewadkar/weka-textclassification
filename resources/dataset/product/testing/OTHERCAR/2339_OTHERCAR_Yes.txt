            When I started shopping for my first digital camera, I did not expect to find the PDR-M4.  I expected to buy some cheap, run of the mill, pretty looking digital camera. (And I did, it was called the Agfa Smile, but that is a different opinion submission).  When I finished wading through all of the people at the computer store and saw all of my choices, I was discouraged.  But after observing all of the features of the 20 or so choice cameras, I narrowed it down to just a few including the PDR-M4.  

The thing that made me choose the PDR M-4 over all of my other possible cameras was the fact that it had a zoom, mega pixel technology, a sleek and small design, and that Toshiba is a very respectable company.

The zoom on the PDR-M4 is pretty good.  The reason it is only pretty good is that when you zoom, the picture is somewhat distorted once taken.  And when zoomed, you cannot use the flash capability.  But if you really need a perfect photo quality picture then you should get closer to whatever you are trying to photograph.

The Mega Pixel technology on this camera is great.  It is one of the only 2.1 mega pixel cameras that I know of that is under $600.  And another good feature of this mega pixel is that you have 6 different picture qualities to choose from.  You have regular, second level regular, third level regular, super regular, second level super, and third level super. This may sound confusing but you come to love it when you have limited space on your storage card.  

The sleek and small design is really nice.  This camera is not the lightest thing I have ever held but it is definitely not as heavy as some regular cameras I have owned.  Like some other people have said in their reviews, the silver color rubs or chips off in some high use places on the camera but that is just normal wear and tear and my camera still looks like new after taking it on lots of trips including one to Mexico for a week and a half. I have dropped it in the case that I bought for it and I did not break, that is a good thing. (It doesn't come with a case).  The battery life is pretty good and I haven't really found any battery life saved by not using the LCD screen.  And the flash doesn't seem to drain he battery.  But I use the charger to charge it before I use it.  The camera holds its battery charge for about 2 weeks.  Then it pretty much needs to be recharged if not used.  The PDR M-4 can fit in my pocket but it is a little to heavy to keep there all day.  

So in conclusion, the PDR M-4 is a great camera and I would recommend it to my friends.  It has served me well in he past and I think it will keep doing the job for years to come.
