            I've had a Dodge Ram 50 for about a year and a half now, and I can say good and bad things about it. This truck does deserve some respect though as it started a long line of dependable, powerful Dodge pickups.

At first glance it is a small, 4 cylinder pickup. My truck has a 2.6 liter engine and carries about 110 HP, maybe a bit more. But it's the truck's torque that'll surprise you! It has enough low-end torque to pull something three times the trucks own weight (my truck weighs 2500 pounds) and can haul almost 1400 pounds in its bed. Mine also only has a 4 speed manual so it doesn't get the maximum gas mileage it could get with a 5-speed, but I still get around 17/22 mpg. And with all that torque, I have accomplished 0-60 in under 12 seconds. Also the brakes are about the best I've seen in a vehicle in a long time!!! And I can top 75 easy even with a 800 pounds of junk in the bed!

One fact about these trucks: they are very durable. This truck has been everywhere and has never suffered any serious damage. There is just no stopping this machine! Don't take my word for it, go get a Ram 50 and drive it down a rough road! It is a car-like ride and very smooth especially if your shocks are really good. My truck has 200,000 miles and although it eats oil is still going strong!

Now this truck ISN'T perfect. It certainly isn't a strong truck compared to todays pickups, and isn't for the kind of person who wants a fast, macho truck. Fast it isn't (90 mph top speed, and getting there takes forever), and the 2.6 I4 isn't a big engine. Also the truck is small and can only hold two people safely. But the bed on this truck is BIG, which is surpising. Just don't try hauling anything over a 1,400 pounds or you'll be in trouble.

So if you're a single guy with taste for small, indestructible trucks this is for you. You won't be disappointed. And the early D-50s had neat interiors. Check them out for yourself!
