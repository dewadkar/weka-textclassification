            I had a 1996 Cavalier before the Ford Taurus I now own. I loved it. It got great gas mileage and had just enough power to keep me happy. I had only driven 8 cylinder cars before I purchased the cavalier and so I was afraid that it would not have enough get up and go for me. I fell in love with this car from the moment that I got in it for a test drive. I am married and have a pretty good sized son and there was enough room to be comfortable for a little while. My son finally grew out of it a year ago. Hence the reason we bought a Taurus. We needed more leg room in the back. I am a big girl too and I could sit in the back seat so there was enough room but on long drives it got a little uncomfortable in the back seat. I would say that for the price and the performance of the cavalier, It is well worth it. <br><br>
