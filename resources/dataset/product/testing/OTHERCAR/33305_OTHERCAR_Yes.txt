            I have owned my 1998 Forester since January of 1998. The Forester has been a joy to own. The only item to fail in the vehicle in the past two years and 30,000 miles was the light bulb in the interior dome light. The vehicle has been flawless otherwise. There was a recall to replace the brake master cylinder, (which applied to most of the 1998 and 1999 Subaru vehicles) that was replaced through the dealership in about two hours. 

This vehicle has almost every option available in 1998 for the Forester. 

Things I like the most:

The vehicle is fun to drive, extremely stable at freeway speeds, and handles exceptionally well for an SUV. 
The optional leather seating and wood accent trim give the vehicle  comfortable front seats and a pleasing appearance. 
The engine has good power, but I personally would like some additional power for passing  that either supercharging or turbo charging would offer.
I also recommend the &quot;S&quot; model to obtain the 4 wheel disk brakes and larger tires, which provides better stopping and handling than the disc/drum and smaller tires in the standard offering.  



Things I dislike:

This is a very short list. The cup holders seem somewhat flimsy, although I almost never use it.

The radio and CD player controls take some time to become familiar in their usage. Part of this is because Subaru spoils a driver with all the other vehicle controls being in the places where you expect them to be located.

The rear seats tend to be very flat and similar to a bench seat, but they do fold completely flat when you need extra carrying space.

Overall opinion:

In the small class of SUV, I think this is the top of the list. Reliable, comfortable, agile. This vehicle is for anyone who wants a dependable SUV for running errands to taking an extended camping or ski trip.
