              This is the luxury car of yesterday: Chrome, flashiness, pillowy ride, leather sofa seats, gigantic trunk, and big V8 power, but with a modern twist.  This is most likely your parents' dream car, and when you get old, it will most likely be yours also.

  When my 1998 Lincoln Navigator blew its fourth cylender early this week, I took it in for service. The lincoln dealer so kindly provided me keys for a beautiful Pearl White 2001 Lincoln Town car Executive series.  I first though "Oh no, not a float mobile!", and I was right on that assumption, however as soon as I started driving it I felt relaxed and began to love the car.

   The vehicle grew on me for the 2 days I owned it, espeically after a 2 hour journey into the pennsylvania mountains where I would be left cramped up if I was in my supra, left hurting for gas in my navigator, or claustrophobic in my little mercedes SLK.  THe Town car is the PERFECT long distance sedan, a limo for the rest of us.

   It also accels at shopping trips, the trunk is HUGE!  No wonder the mob loves this car so much!!  I could fit 2 full grown human men in there and still have room for a set of golf clubs! And the power, so seamless and silky, this 4.6 liter SOHC motor from its cousin, the mercury grand marquis, really gets this big boat up and running.  tHis car reminded me in so many ways of a car I so dearly miss, my wife's old 1994 Buick Roadmaster sedan.

   This car is popular for a reason. It's roomy, quick, oh so comfortable, and ritzy.  Maybe I'm getting old, but I would own this car.
