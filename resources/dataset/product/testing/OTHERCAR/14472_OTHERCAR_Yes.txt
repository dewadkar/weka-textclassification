            I've had other digital cameras, but this camera blows them away when you factor in price and performance.  I found it at Best Buy for $199, and it came with freea $40 travel package including case, rechargeable battery, and recharger.  2.0 Megapixels is the perfect size, and the 3X digital zoom is wonderful.  16MB of internal memory is enough for 23 pictures at the "best quality" setting.

The perfect companion to this package is a digital memory card reader, where I can easily slip in my SD memory card.  This accessory allows for the transfer of pictures without draining the batteries on the camera.  It only cost $20. It also eliminates the need for the $80 camera dock.

I've been very pleased with the photos so far.  I attempted to use the Aladdin development system at a local Walgreens, but the system could not read directly from the digital card due to the fact the pictures files are stored in a directory.  The workaround is to burn the picture files to a CD and use the CD.  For $.30/pic I developed only 30 out of 75 pictures, which is the equivalent of 5 roles of film.  My brother-in-law, who is a photographer sceptical of digital cameras, could not tell that the 4" x 6" photos were digital once printed on regular camera paper. 

Enlargements are a snap with the Kodak Easyshare software.  I easily cropped a portion of a picture and enlarged it.  The new picture looks great with no pixelation.  I could easily do an 8" x 10" with this camera. 

In regards to price and performance, this camera has worked out very well for me.
