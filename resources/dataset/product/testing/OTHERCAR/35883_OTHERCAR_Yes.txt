            Having only been driving for a little bit now, I am what someone would probably call an Inexperienced driver and have only driven 3 Different cars. A 1997 Ford Taurus, A 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix and a 1996 Jeep Cherokee Sport. Being a new driver, I am not experienced in making clean turns, staying in the middle of the road etc. Having driven the three cars above, I came to the conclusion that the Jeep Cherokee Sport was the most easiest to Control and Handle and keep from hitting the other cars. If a brand new driver has ease handling this vehicle then that say's something about the handling of the vehicle, it says that the vehicle has great Handling and Control.

What is the interior Like?
The interior is quite roomy. Though it is quite rugged looking on the interior (looks like something you might expect a jeep to look like), it is very comfortable. The standard Class comes with Auto-Windows, A reliable tapedeck, a good sound system and a very good A/C and Heating Modules. In the Higher Models it also comes with A CD Player.

Where do I buy a Jeep Cherokee Sport?
It shouldn't be a chore to find an Auto-Dealership that sells the Jeep Cherokee Sport. Look in your phone book in the yellow pages, or go online to Yahoo, or Altavista to find a dealership near you. Look in the Classifieds as well, someone might me selling one in your town.

Are there any Problems with The Cherokee Sport?
I couldn't find any problems with the Sport, and I do not recall my father nor my mother who said that there was anything wrong with the car. The only time the car has every been serviced was for an Oil Change or Annually recquired Service.

What are some other Types of SUV models?
Well other SUV models include: Ford Expedition, Dodge Durango, Ford Explorer, and many others. If I had to pick one SUV out from this crowd that was the best deal and the best SUV, I would have to say that the Jeep Cherokee Sport meets these standards. If you are planning on buying an SUV I would Recommend a Jeep Cherokee Sport. Whether you are buying a used or New Car, it would be a good car to buy.Superior enough handling for even a novice driver.
Would be a great first car, and also someone who has experience. It's a well-rounded car.
