            I hate sport-utility vehicles.  Even more so I hate the people who buy them as a fashion accessory.  I hate the people who buy an SUV because they're &quot;in.&quot;

In turn, I hate the 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe.

This is difficult for me.  You see, my parents just bought a 1999 2-door, 4 wheel drive Tahoe.  Basically I'm telling them they just flushed $35,000 dollars down the toilet.  Guess I'm out of the will now.  Anyway, back the Tahoe.

My problem is that it doesn't do anything well.  It brakes like crap, it handles like crap, and it rides like crap.  Did I mention the obscene gas mileage.  Basically this Tahoe has all of two things truly going for it. One: it is good off-road, and two: it accelerates well (thanks to the 5.7L V8), considering its amazing heft (about 5400 pounds).  Oh and it has good visibility.  Big deal.

Not only that but the thing is horribly inefficient.  You'd think for all that size it would have a lot of luggage space or be able to tow a mountain.  Not so fast. The luggage space is disappointing for the Tahoe's size (the interior spare doesn't help) and it can't even to its own weight around.  At least the 4WD looks ruggedly handsome.

Inside is a boxy &quot;to-hell-with-ergonomics&quot; dashboard with amazingly little storage.  Seems like most things are out of reach, and the fact that the rear pillar (on dual cargo door models) is directly in the middle of the rear-view mirror doesn't help any.  Hope you like using your side mirrors (which are commendably big).  Seats are uncomfortable and provide nothing in the way of support when cornering.  Not that you ever actually corner in this thing (thank God for high centers of gravity).  You more or less barge about, making constant steering corrections down even the most straight, level, and smooth roads.  At least there's some small wisp of hope for the future, as the next generation is now debuting and apparently is much improved.

In any case if you are in the market for a $35,000 used car (or less, depending on how old you're willing to go) steer clear of any Chevrolet Tahoes (and, in my opinion, SUVs in general) unless you do serious off-roading on a regular basis or have no need for brakes, handling, or gas mileage.  There's better fare to be had.  Like I said folks, move along...<br><br>
