            My husband and I bought a 1999 Golf GL because we have been faithful customers of VW.  We also loved the look and feel of the car, as well as the price.

However, just as our Golf turned 1 year old the engine began dying unexpectedly.  This car has been back to the dealer 7 times to repair the same problem.  Each time they claim to have fixed it, but don't. The dealership has involved VW headquarters, even calling Germany and have not yet been able to figure out what is wrong with this car. Yet they refuse to buy it back or give us a replacement.

To be fair, when it does drive, it handles beautifully.  We also liked the passenger and side impact airbags that come standard with the GL package.

We understand that every manufacturer can produce a defective car unintentionally.  We are just very disappointed at how VW has treated us.  They have been very rude and unhelpful with this situation.  This car is unsafe to drive, and I am surprised that VW cares so little about it's customers safety.<br><br>
