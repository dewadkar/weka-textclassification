            When the BMW Z3 first debuted in the 1996 model year, the only engine choice available to U.S. buyers was the 1.9-liter 138-hp 4-cylinder powerplant which compared favorably with the 1.8-liter 133-hp Mazda Miata at the time. In 1997, the 2.8-liter 189-hp 6-cylinder engine was offered as an option, and in 1998 the 3.2-liter 240-hp 6-cylinder M Roadster was introduced as BMW's M-Sport division version of the Z3. Certainly, the Z3 is a roadster with an engine for everyone's budget.

In 1999, the 1.9-liter 4-cylinder engine was replaced by a 2.5-liter 170-hp 6-cylinder engine (inexplicably designated as the 2.3 model). By offering the 2.3 model for $500 more than the outgoing 1.9 model, BMW clearly set the tone that it is a forward-thinking never-look-back kind of company: the 2.3 offers a great value to new buyers, but deflates the pride of 1.9 owners who now have to wonder about their future resale values.

For the 2000 model year, the Z3 receives a very mild facelift treatment. So mild, in fact, that most casual observers won't see the difference. The most significant styling changes, however, can be found in the Z3's rear end. The rear light cluster has been freshened and more smoothly-integrated into the bodywork. The rear quarters now have a sculpted hump that adds some more interesting curves into the bodywork, but its also a copied design from the Porsche Boxster and 1999+ Mazda Miata. In the front, the Z3's twin headlights are now fitted with chrome rings (personally, I think BMW has a chrome fetish these days).

Inside, all Z3s now come with an attractive (and appropriate) M-Sport 3-spoke steering wheel with SRS airbag, and the center console controls below the climate control knobs are more well laid-out now. A feature I particularly admire is the standard analog clock that is placed just below the temperature knob. It reminds me of the famous Infiniti clocks, but more significantly, its a refreshingly classy touch from an automaker that usually finds a way of including more of its red LED electronics into the center console every year (now, if they can just find a way of offering the useful trip computer and analog clock in the same interior specification...). The softtop is now double-lined for additional sound and weather insulation. And, at long last, an in-dash CD radio is available, hopefully putting to rest the German notion &quot;if you want to play CDs in your car, you must use the trunk-mounted CD changer&quot;.

Mechanically, the only change for the 2000 model year is the addition of Dynamic Stability Control (DSP) as standard equipment in the Z3 2.3 and 2.8, while the M Roadster receives All Season Traction (AST) as standard. What's the difference between these two forms of traction control? DSP electronically monitors front and rear wheel rotational speed, steering wheel angle, lateral acceleration and yaw angle, reducing engine power and applying front and/or rear braking accordingly to prevent understeer and oversteer. AST is less sophisticated, monitoring only the rear wheels for loss of traction, adjusting the engine's electronic throttle position and ignition timing to reduce torque. AST can also apply each rear brake, individually or simulaneously, as needed to assist regaining traction. Both systems are defeatable via a center console switch. For regular everyday driving, it would be advisable to let DSP/AST handle any emergency situations. But if you are taking your Z3 onto the track or want to produce the quickest 0-to-60 mph times, switch off DSP/AST, fully engage the clutch while revving the engine up to 6000 rpm, select 1st gear, and drop the clutch... the rear wheels should smoke up, while also launching the car to its maximum acceleration capability (you can do the same with an automatic: select Drive and fully engage the brake pedal while also engaging the throttle pedal... the rear tires should start smoking, then release the brakes).

The Z3 2.3 and 2.8 engines use Double VANOS which is BMW's variable valve timing technology. The &quot;Double&quot; designates BMW's innovative use of VVT on both the intake and exhaust valves (the M Roadster's engine receives a simpler [single] VANOS system).

The four speed automatic transmission now incorporates Adaptive Transmission Control (ATC) which monitors throttle and braking operation patterns to select an optimum shift response program. Additionally, ATC can recognize steep ascents/descents, slippery conditions, stop-and-go traffic, or high-speed cornering and adjust upshifts and downshifts appropriately.

All BMWs since the 1997 model year have been covered by the BMW Scheduled Maintenance program which provides all regularly-scheduled service visits during the first 3 years or 36,000 miles free-of-charge. True, its a couple oil changes, one minor and one major service, but it also represents BMW's confidence in quality and reliability of its vehicles. And with so many people leasing these days, a typical 36-month lease of a BMW wouldn't incur any maintenance costs.

So what do all the changes for 2000 mean? More technology means a safer, more useful roadster in my book. The Z3 never tried to be a better Miata (i.e. lightweight, inexpensive go-kart optimized for dry weather running) but rather a BMW first, and a roadster second. The result is successful: the Z3 can safely be used for everyday duty in all types of dry &amp; wet weather, while also being a strong performer on the highways and long-sweeping curves. These hallmarks of BMW philosophy allow the Z3 to remain competitive in the roadster marketplace: it is a step-up from a Miata, a step-down from the Boxster, more sporty than a SLK230, more seductively-styled than the industrial-looking Audi TT Roadster, and more luxurious/prestigious than the Honda S2000. The Z3's $30,000-to-$40,000 price range is right on target, too, offering a great consumer value for all of BMW's technology and luxury.

The 2000 model year freshening also marks the mid-life cycle of the first generation Z3. Already, reports are beginning to surface regarding the next iteration of the Z3, which should make its appearance for the 2003 model year. I would expect BMW to address the much-criticized trailing-arm rear suspension, replacing it with the company's more refined multi-link type. The evolution of the Z3's bodywork styling should be an important goal--following initial success is tough to replicate, as Mazda discovered with its 1999 Miata not nearly causing the same stir as the original 1990 model did. A glass rear window in the softop would be a welcome improvement, as well as an easier-to-use tonneau cover (perhaps made of leather in matching interior color, replacing the hard plastic type currently in use) but a retractable steel roof (like the SLK) would be an unnecessary compromise of storage space in the rear trunk, unless engineers can work some magic to negate this tradeoff. Xenon headlamps and LED brakelamps would be nice, too. Inside, the Oregon textured leather needs to die a quick and quiet death. It has always looked cheap and out-of-place in a car that wears the BMW badge. The Napa leather should be standard in all Z3s, but keep the wide variety of color combinations (side seats/center seats/dash/trim). A little less use of chrome, clean-up the finicky front air dam fascia, and continue to offer the aggressively-bolstered sport seats. Those would be my suggestions for the next Z3. 

In the meantime, the 2000 Z3 2.3 represents a great value for a BMW and a superbly-useable all-around roadster.<br><br>
