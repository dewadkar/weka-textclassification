I'd been debating about buying a digital camera for at least two years. After memorizing features and functions of all of the major cameras (and realizing that it would be a complete waste to spend more money to get a camera with higher than 2.14 megapixel resolution) I narrowed my choices down to a few cameras, one being the Toshiba PDR-M5. The Toshiba had all of the features that the more expensive Sony and Nikon digital cameras did (3x zoom, USB interface, capability of making movies, and 1600x1200 resolution for pictures) at about half the price - $450 on the Toshiba website which included a camera case and extra rechargeable battery. 

Even though I loved the Toshiba, I still wasn't ready to spend that much money on a toy for myself. Enter the Toshiba class action lawsuit. Toshiba had produced faulty disk drives in the Tecra laptop (which my boyfriend owned) that would result in complete loss of sometimes-important data. Because Toshiba had covered up the failure and denied that it existed for some time, a class action lawsuit was brought about by those affected by the flaw. As part of the settlement, those affected received both checks from the company as well as a gift card of varying amounts good on ANY Toshiba product. While a cover up of a flaw is usually enough to make me run from the company, when that $225 gift card came in the mail, I just couldn't pass up the opportunity. 

My PDR-M5 came <b>2</b> days after ordering, 5 days before Christmas. Considering I'd not expected my camera to arrive until sometime around the New Year, I was completely amazed at the level of customer service Toshiba showed. All parts (including the case and extra battery) were shipped correctly, to the address I'd specified that was different from the billing address. 

Playing with the camera is the most fun of all. The battery takes about 5 hours to fully charge (from no power at all) but I've found battery life to be fairly long - about 3 hours of use using the flash half of the time. The pictures (all taken in high resolution mode) come out extremely crisp and lifelike, with good colouring. The display lets you know when you need to hold the camera quite steady (due to poor light, which results in the shutter being open longer) and also has easy to use menus and a simple trash can button for those photos you don't want to save. 

On the way home to Detroit from my parents house in Greenville, South Carolina, we had fun playing with the camera will the car was moving through the mountains. Shots taken from the side windows (at about 60mph) came out fairly good, with only slight blurring around the edges. Shots from the front window, even around curves, came out very crisp. The best part - we filmed a 30 second "movie" while driving downhill on one stretch of highway. The whole 30 seconds is extremely crisp, with good colouring and almost video camera quality. This camera will produce pictures crisp enough to expand into 8x10 printed photos, more than enough for the parent wanting Christmas/Birthday photos to send to relatives. 

The Toshiba PDR-M5 has the ability for new lenses, tripods, and other such attachments, making it good for a more serious photographer. The base Smart Memory the camera comes with is 8 megs - I purchased a 16 meg Smart Memory chip from eBay for $15, which was well worth the investment, even though 8 megs will get you 16 high quality images. As Smart Memory prices come down, 64 meg chips are worth their weight in gold - one chip with the camera set to take high medium sized high resolution pictures held over 400 images. 

One of the only drawbacks with the camera is its size. The camera is more bulky than most, reminding me more of semi-professional cameras than one people take on trips. Carrying the camera around in the case can get heavy and annoying, especially in crowded situations where space is at a premium. 

The other two drawbacks are little more than a hassle, at best. The design of the camera is such that when looking through the view screen with the zoom lens fully extended, the bottom right corner of your view is obstructed by the zoom lens. While this doesn't show up in the pictures, it's slightly un-nerving when trying to get that perfect shot. The other issue is with the design of the lens cap. It's almost impossible to get the lens cap on tightly - if you try to screw it on, it falls off, and if you try to push it on, it falls off. Thankfully, the cap is attached to the camera, making it harder to loose. Because of the ill-designed lens cap, I would not carry this camera around outside of the case for any amount of time. 

After owning (and using) this camera for over half a year, I still highly recommend it for someone <i>not</i> looking for a state of the art thousand dollar digital camera. The camera was an excellent addition during my trip to Ireland. Thanks to available firmware upgrades (found on the Toshiba website) low-light pictures turn out as crisp and clear as do full light pictures. The colour contrast in normal light was also greatly improved with the upgrade, making the majority of my pictures from Ireland absolutely stunning. Like all digital cameras, the LCD screen was not viewable most of the time outside, requiring a bit more effort to look through the view screen. The camera still sometimes has problems with contrasts in low light; however, a future firmware upgrade will probably remedy the problem.

While the camera does have minor drawbacks, its low cost (even without the gift card) and good number of features makes it THE camera for someone looking for a 2.1 megapixel digital camera.
