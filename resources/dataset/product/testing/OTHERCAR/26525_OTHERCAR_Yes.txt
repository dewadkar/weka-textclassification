            I have never had a vehicle that has run like my 1994 S-10.  I bought this truck new and as of this day it has 105,000 miles on it.  I use this truck for work transportation as well as to haul feed, hay, firewood and other necessities of life and this 4 cylinder, 5 speed manual tranny continues to average 30 mpg day in and day out.  Being the only driver (my wife can't drive a stick) I know every quirk of this fine truck and let me tell you, Chevy built a winner this time!!  I got 65,000 miles out of the clutch, 85,000 miles out of the brakes, 95,000 out of the tires, shocks and exhaust system !!!  After my spring oil change and with a new set of plugs, my S-10 will be ready for another 105,000 miles.  Sure, I'd like to have a newer model with a few more &quot;toys&quot; in it but what the heck - this baby's been paid for for four years now and continues to run great !! <br><br>
