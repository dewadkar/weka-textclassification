            I purchased a used two-door Dodge Neon with automatic transmission about 2 years ago.  I have been fairly happy with it, although it has had a few minor problems.  The engine is an I4, it has a wide wheel base, and has about average pickup.  I bought it used with 35,500 miles, and it is now at 48,500 miles.  

I bought it mainly because of the price ($7,500!) which was a pretty good bargain for a 2 year old car.  It lacks basically every available option except automatic transmission.  

Throughout the 2 years I've owned it, I have brought it into the shop 2 times for repair.  The first time I brought it in was due to a horrible squeaking noise when I braked.  I figured I had worn the brake pads down, but the mechanic inspected them and said they were 'like new'.  He said that this was a common problem for the Neon and it might go away in time.  Two years later, my car still squeaks sometimes when I brake, usually when I first start driving.  

The second problem was a slow oil leak that I noticed a few months ago.  I brought the car in and the mechanic determined that the engine had a slow oil leak from the head gasket and it would need to be replaced.  But, it turned out to be a manufacture's defect and I only had to pay $100 dollars to replace it, Plymouth picked up the rest.  It seems to have stopped now.

I have also had to get the AC unit replenished after it quit working.  I have read many complaints about the reliability of the AC in Neons, so beware of that.  We'll see how long it lasts me this time.

Another relatively new problem arose with the turn signal lever.  It has recently decided not to stay down when I push it, and so I must hold it down to signal a turn!  The signal itself still flashes, so no real danger.  I'll soon get that fixed.

The car gets good gas mileage which is nice for driving back and forth from college.  It cruises relatively quietly, and has a nice comfortable ride.  At high speeds (60-80)the sound of the wind will sometimes seep through the space between the door and the frame.  This can be annoying on long trips.  The pickup is more than adequate for most situations.

I have to admit that the car has a 'plasticy' feel to it.  It just feels very light and vulnerable in an accident.  The interior is nothing to rave about, just very simple and plain which is fine with me.  My Neon doesn't have any special features like automatic windows, power locks, or cruise control.  I don't mind not having most of those because they would have cost me more.

The back seat is average for a sporty two-door.  Not much room, but still comfortable for 2 people when driving less than an hour.  I don't think it would be comfortable on long trips though.

The speakers really impressed me.  They are extremely crisp, and the base is very pronounced for factory installed speakers.  My Neon only had a radio, but I bought a 12 disk CD changer which was installed in the trunk.  

Speaking of the trunk, it is probably an average to above average size for a 2-door car.  I haven't had any trouble packing things in there.

One thing I found odd is the key situation with the Neon.  There is one key for the door, one for the ignition, and another for the trunk!!  They are color coded to help you remember which one is which, but it is sometimes hard to tell them apart in the dark.  I just thought that was strange of them to do that.  Another thing that bugs me is the lack of a trunk release on the inside of the car!  It does make for a more secure trunk though...

I think this car is a very good first or second car for a beginning driver.  It doesn't have all the frills of newer cars, but because of that it has a low price tag.  The problems I've had are relatively minor, and if you look to buy this car I would ask about these known problems, and if they've already been fixed.  Good luck!<br><br>
