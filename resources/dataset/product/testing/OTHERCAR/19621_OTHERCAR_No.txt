            I bought a lovely, dark green 1991 Plymouth Acclaim in January of 2002.  It was used when I bought it for $2000 and had about 70,000 miles on it.  I didn't have any problems with it until June.  However, during those months I had not driven the car more than a few miles away from my home, as I was still a student in high school.  

I drove my car from Texas to North Carolina in late May without any problems.  I then drove from North Carolina to Ohio, and it was Ohio when the trouble began.  The car began to shake quite violently and stall while I was driving down an interstate near Dayton, Ohio.  I pulled over on the side of the road to gun it a bit, hoping to get whatever the problem was out of the system.  It died completely.  While in Dayton, I spent about $500 on the car, just to try and get home to Texas.

Once I got back home, the car was fine for a few weeks, then it began to shake and die while I was driving.  Again, spending $500-600 to try and fix it.  The mechanic told me the problem was the thermostat had broken and the engine was running a lot colder than it should have been.

By the way, while the car was having so many problems, dying and shaking, the gas mileage was absolutely horrible.  I was getting about 8 miles per gallon just before I had the mechanic look at it.

Now nearly a year later, I still have the same car, but only because I'm in college now and cannot afford a another one.  It still stalls and dies while I'm driving.  The mechanic did manage to get the shaking to stop, at least.  When the car does die, it is very reluctant to restart and will die again within five minutes most of the time, sometimes before I even have a chance to put it into gear.

I also had problems with the transmission and the wiring underneath the hood, but nothing very specific.

I would not recommend this car to anyone.  It has been nothing but a waste of time, money, and patience.
