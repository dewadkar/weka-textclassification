            I recently traded my 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse for a 1999 3000GT.  After purchasing my Eclipse, I learned that the 2000 body style had been changed.  I visited the dealership to see the new body style, and didn't care for it and I didn't feel good about just buying a car that the body style was about to change on.  I noticed the 3000GT on the lot and test drove it.  I can't describe the difference in the two accurately enough!  The 3000 drives like a dream!  It has a much more stable feel than the Eclipse.  It handles in curves like it's glued to the road.  I've never owned a vehicle that feels as secure as this one.  The interior is similar but has more luxury detailing.  The Eclipse had a very limited turning radius, which was one of the features that I was most disappointed in, however, the 3000 will absolutely turn on a dime!  For the money, the 3000 being about 10,000 more than the Eclipse you can't buy a more dependable and performance oriented car.  My insurance increased about $90.00 a year, which I thought was very reasonable and was surprised by.  

Since I've purchased this car, everyone I know wants to test drive it and I go with them.  The one most important factor that I've noticed, is that it takes an experienced, mature driver to own and operate this car.  It would be entirely too easy for a person to try and exceed their driving capabilities as the 3000 will do as much as you demand from it.  However, I wouldn't recommend that a young or inexperienced driver be tempted with the power that the 3000 is capable of.  As a mature person with good driving skills, I've been tempted to push the car past my capabilities and can easily imagine the possibility of losing control of the car.  It's a car that demands respect of it's strength.

Since I originally posted this, I've flipped my 3000.  I was taking a curve to fast and hit loose gravel and while I was trying to regain control of the car I over did it.  No-one was hurt, and the damage to the car was minimal, it needed a new front and rear quarter panel on the drivers side and a lot of work on the roof.  However, I still think as much of the 3000 as I originally did.  I just wanted to emphasize the maturity it takes to own and drive this car!  Obviously I was being a little immature this particular day!<br><br>
