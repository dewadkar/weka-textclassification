            I am embarrassed to say that I bought this Jam Cam Jr. camera at a on-line auction site.

I read some of the reviews after I bid on it. I wish I had read them before. But I thought that I was safe for the price. 

The reason I wanted it was so I could sell some things on line. 
I am not sure what I am planning on selling, but with this camera, I will have to take whatever it is outside and hope for a sunny day. Not too many of those lately here.

The camera looks like a toy. Probably because that is  basically what it is.

After I won the Bid on this , I found it free with some software on another site. That would have been a better price,  but I did not need two of these things.

After I get a good digital camera, I am going to give this one to my Granddaughter. 

It has a hair trigger button on it to click for the pictures, so it is real easy to click off a picture when you are not planning on it.

One of the things I like about it and the software is that you can do continuous capture pictures . It will keep snapping away every few seconds until you get the picture that you like.

The software that came with the camera is   Microsoft Picture it 99 It has a lot of neat things that you can do with the pictures.

I took pictures inside with it and when we finally had a sunny day, took some outside.
The ones outside were 100% better.

The camera holds 6 pictures, which you can download into the picture it 99 program and save them in an album. Plus there are many other things that you can do with the software program with tint and building a frame around the picture or enclosing the person in the picture in a heart and things like that.

I guess my general recommendation on this camera is that it is good for kids, and fun to learn digital photography and imaging.

If i had it to over again I would have saved my money to get a better camera. One that will hold more pictures and is better quality then this one.

This one did not come with a user manual but it can be downloaded from the manufactures site. 

If you can get this free you should definitely grab it. Otherwise i would not pay over 20.00 for it.
