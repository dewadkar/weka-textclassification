            Now Mercedes are offering a special edition package for the remainder of the 2000 SLK models.  And the best part is, it's 100% free....think about the higher resale value it would have because there are only a limited amount made just for 2000.  Mercedes deserves alot of credit for offering so much for nothing out of your pocket.  The cool new package comes loaded with special order Black Obsidian metallic paint, a shiney, polished steel exhaust tip, limited edition keychain and badge, awesome 17 inch Evo2 aluminum alloy wheels, exotic interior which includes two tone oyster leather upholstery, and charcoal/oyster floormats.  This package totally enhances the looks on this car as it looks more aggressive with the beefier wheels and tires.  The engine and other parts are left unchanged, still with 16 valve 185hp engine, which performs and handles well throughout.  As you can see,  you get many many extras with this limited package so hurry to the dealer and reserve yours today, cause I guarantee those babies are gonna sell like &quot;hotcakes&quot;.  The best part is that the MSRP still stands at $41,000 like all the other SLKs.  <br><br>
