            The most unique feature of this car is how it looks. I got mine last January and I am still turning a head or two. It is BOXY, no doubt about it. Some say to the point it is ugly. SO!!!

I have made 2 road trips in it so far and I love it. First trip Spring Break to NM for some fishing and second LOOOONG trip this summer visiting the SW and Wyoming. It handled great, seats did not leave me sore after a long day of driving, and I spent more nights in it that out of it, although I had to add more padding to even out the bed.

I am satisfied with the mileage and the ride. I bought a bobblehead for the dash and he really doesn't bobble that much. It is extremely roomy for gear if going solo, got the roofrack although I have yet to use it. Cleaning is a breeze as there is no carpet, just wash and go. I am 6'4" and I have plenty of headroom although I would like the seat to go back a little more.

I am seeing more on the road as the popularity of the car continues to rise but it is always nice to talk to people about it. I estimate I have sold 4 or 5 from people stopping me and asking questions, especially this summer while camping in it at the national parks (when it was not too hot).

My next car I believe will be another Element when the newer models come out in the future.
