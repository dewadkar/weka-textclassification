            My family has bought two Chevrolet Cavaliers.  We bought our first Cavalier in 1988.  It was one of the best cars that my family ever bought.

We rarely ever had trouble with the car, besides basic things that need to be replaced (brakes, tires, etc.).  It was a four door with a 2.2 liter four cylinder engine and automatic transmission.  It was a great little car that just kept going.  When we finally got rid of it, it had 205,000 miles!

The second Cavalier we bought was a 1994.  It had a 2.0 liter four cylinder with an automatic transmission.  We have had some problems with the flywheel assembly not working right, but that was fixed under warranty.  It currently has almost 140,000 miles.

If someone is looking for an inexpensive, reliable car that has few problems, then I suggest that they look at a Chevrolet Cavalier.<br><br>
