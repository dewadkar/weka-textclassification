             Where to begin? Well first I want to say I usually love GM products and have owned nothing but for the last 15 years. But this car has taxed my brand loyality to the limit. I bought THE LUMINA 4 years ago to replace the 1990 Olds Cutlass Supreme that had 200,000 relatively trouble free miles on it. Maybe I should have kept the Olds. The Lumina was a base model with air,tilt wheel,power locks, windows and other amenities that I wanted and 38,000 miles. I didn't think a extended warranty would be necessary after all the glowing reviews I had seen. I even called the previous owner, who also gave me a stellar report. 
 1. Well the fun started about 6 months after I purchased the car. The first thing to go was the anti-lock feature of the brakes. The gremlin was one of the actuators on the master cylinder went out which shut down the anti-lock feature all together.
 COST-100.00 master cylinder from junk yard
      150.00 labor
 2.Fuel Pump at 49,000 miles. GOOD LORD help you if one of these goes out(its a dealer only item and you have to buy the complete fuel pump assembly not just the pump). Needless to say after I recovered from the stroke I had once I got the bill I asked for the old pump for posterity. Heck with the core charge I wanted this thing to hang in my garage as a trophy.
 Fuel pump assembly cost-672.00(call your local dealer and check it out)
 Labor-100.00
 3. Alternator 52,000 which I bought and put on myself.
 COST-110.00 after core deduction
 LABOR-FREE!!!!!YEAH
 4. Water pump 58,000 again bought and installed myself
 COST-90.00 after core
 LABOR-FREE!!!!!YEAH AGAIN
 5.Rack and pinion for steering. Tell me one thing how many of you have had a rack go out on any car you've ever owned? I couldn't put this one in I didn't have tools.
 COST-320.00 after core
 Labor-150.00
 6. Power steering pump, as a direct result of the rack going bad.
 COST-75.00
 Labor-50.00
 7.Windshield wiper motor
 COST-125.00
 Labor-50.00
 8.Over the last 4 years I have replace all the power window switches(they all went bad one at a time).
 9. Plus the motor now leaks oil like a sieve.
 As I writing this I am the process of trading the car off. I waited this long because even though I only bought the car for 7000.00 I was still buried in it. I think I will try a Ford Escape this time, even though I have had even worse luck with Fords in the past than this. I just need a brake from the General...I paid enough of his bills with this car. 

Well here we, almost a year later. The plan for a new car went down the tubes (kinda like my job at the time). I think the Lumina must have seen the review that I composed.  The madness behind my reasoning is, "Christine" (this is the cars new name), came after my wallet with a vengeance. 

Where to begin...

 10. Two coil packs went bad.
  Cost: 23.00 apiece
  Labor: Free I decided money was more important than being lazy.

 11. Spark Plugs--Dont get sucked in like I did get, regular plugs work just as well as Platinum plugs. This will save you about 25.00
  Cost: 38.00
  Labor: Again free even through many skinned fingers and  expletives.

 12. Plug wires-Again don't let the boy at Advance Auto Parts try to drain you dry. The cheapest "GOOD" set of plugs set me back a few shackles.
  Coat: 28.00
  Labor: Free
 
 These items were replaced due to all failing at once. I was told when one system went out it took the rest with it. Again plugs and wires were less than a year old.
 
13. Well guess what the same day I replaced the above problems the battery went snafu.
  Cost: 45.00 with 10.00 core
  Labor: Free
 
Okay we cruising now we have replaced almost every major component what else might you ask? 
  
 14. Let me tell you something....the throttle positioning sensor went out causing major crappo running. How much do you think a 2.5 inch long, by 1.5 tall piece of plastic cost?
  Cost: 37.00
  Labor: free
  
 15. Okay now, here we go, the car ran good for 1 week. I finally after pulling what little hair I had left out, took the car to my new favorite friend, the mechanic. After disassembly of the throttle body and a complete cleaning also clearing the problem codes from the computer (all 12 of them) we seem to be on a even keel for the moment.

 I must say, I do truly HATE this car, and unfortunately pouring money into this turd is infinitely cheaper than a new car payment, which I can't afford right now. 

 Again, unfortunately the car has to many miles, or I would pursue the lemon law. This is in the many ways the absolute worst car I have ever owned. I think a Yugo would be more reliable than what this car has been.
