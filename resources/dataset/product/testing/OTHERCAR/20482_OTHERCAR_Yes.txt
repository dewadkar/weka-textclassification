            The 3rd generation Mitsubishi Eclipse appeals to a lot of people, and turned a number of others off to the brand.

This car is a very refined automobile, especially with the V6.  The engine is silky smooth, and so is the ride.  The problem is that the Eclipse used to be the bad boy on the street, with a huge aftermarket following, and enormous power gains to be found with a little tweaking.  For those who wished that this car would be in the same vein, disappointment was found.

However, what is there today is a fast "Sporty" car that is not pretentious.  It provides a very comfortable ride, and plenty of excitement for folks that aren't looking to street race with the street crowd.  The car's handling is very good, you feel the road and how the car reacts to it.  It is a very easy car to drive, even with the forgiving manual transmission.

The interior is clean, and useful.  Although build quality is a little disappointing.  Even Honda civics these days have the soft cushiony vinyl making up most of the dash, the eclipse sports nice HARD plastic.  The doors, and center console are much better.

For those that need a back seat don't be fooled.  This car has one, but if you keep passengers in there for more than 30 minutes you obviously don't like them very much.  However, if you push them down the Eclipse gives you a LOT of trunk space.  Let me make that clear, this car will hold a LOT of cargo!!

If you like doing U-turns, think again with this car.  This thing needs a whole three lanes to turn around.  If you like to backup into your parking spot, you may have a hard time also, since the rear-window visibility in this car is very limited.

The Eclipse is a Sports car, so the inconveniences of a sports car are to be expected.  What you give up in comfort (not a lot trust me), you make up in power and that great feeling you get from driving in such a hot car.
