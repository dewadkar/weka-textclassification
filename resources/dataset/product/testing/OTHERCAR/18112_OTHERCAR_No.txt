            In the summer of '98 I bought a '97 Mystique that had 17,000 mile on it.  Since then I have had 5 recall notices on my car.  Two of these recalls were things that had already gone wrong on my car.  The other three may happen in the future.  The first recall was a blinker light which was something that I fixed on my own.  The other recall was my car's wiring harness.  When my car shorted out, I was stranded in downtown Chattanooga(eight hours away from my house) at midnight.  It took $600 to fix my car.  Last week, I got a recall notice saying they would pay me for this work done.  Another recall that hasn't happened yet is the struts on my car.  This is very expensive work to be done on a car(about $1000).  The speakers have also gone out in my car.  Other people who have a Mystique love their car, I guess I just got a lemon.  I get good gas mileage and, when it runs, it runs really well.  The ride is very smooth.  Who should by this car?  Anyone who wants to pay a whole lot of money, then get paid back for it later.  <br><br>
