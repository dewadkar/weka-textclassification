            As a beta tester of digital cameras at Agfa, I found the 1280 to be the best in their low-price range.  The agfa e-photo 1280 is an excellent machine, but it has a few shortcomings.

The first positive thing that struck me about this camera was the image quality.  Agfa is well-known for color accuracy, and I believe they are the best in it.  As compared to many other cameras which I have used in my career, the 1280 has the perfect mix between brightness, contrast and color tone.  The pictures show an excellent reflection of what reality is really like.  Other brands can really have problems with darker environments (eg. inside a building).  This camera adjusts perfectly to any situation with any lighting conditions.

On the other side, this camera is (to me) not the perfect one.  It has a few shortcomings which are not vital, but there needs to be some improvement.  First of all, the software included in the box is too basic for such an expensive machine.  It includes less functions than a normal shareware program would.  I consider it more like a photobook program than an image-retouching utility.  Another thing I found was that the design of the camera is a little limited.  It feels like they did a rush job on that.

Overall, this is an excellent digital camera for people that need digital imaging at good quality/price ratio.  The best feature of it (i believe) is the link for video output.  This is great when you want to show your friends or family the pictures that you have taken.  With other cams you would have to install software, hook up the camera to a computer, and all the hassle that comes with it.

Excellent!<br><br>
