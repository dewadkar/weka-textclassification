            There are many reasons why I bought the 2000 SAAB 9-5 SE. The looks of the 9-5 are far superior to the 9-3. There is just something I am not crazy about in the design of the 9-3. So I settled on the 9-5.

The 9-5 seems to have achieved a good balance between performance and looks. While it isn't the fastest car, the 170 horse power v6 will keep a smile on your face while zipping around town. The interior is well designed, and the details are what set this car apart. From the ignition in between the front seats, to the dual sun visors, to the rear view mirror that dims to keep those high beams from blinding you, to the glove compartment that has a temperature gauge allowing you to chill drinks, to the firm, but comfortable heated leather seats, this has got to be one of nicest riding cars I've had the opportunity to drive. The Harmon Kardon audio system is the icing on the cake....

Another reason I bought this car, is because you don't see a lot of them on the road. Why? I don't know. Almost all the reviews here are favorable, the car looks beautiful and nothing like it's past quirkier models. <br><br>
