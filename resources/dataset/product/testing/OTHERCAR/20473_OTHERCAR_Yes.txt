            The Cheverolet Lumina is a great passenger car that I would recommend to any driver.  The style is one of a kind and very aerodynamic.  It looks and acts like a sleek sports car, but looks like a family car.  When you need to, this car can put out a lot of power.

The mileage on the Lumina is fairly decent.  It's definitely not a SUV when it comes time to buy gas down the street.  Especially with the prices we have now.  And since it's a V-6 and not an 8, that helps even more with gas mileage.  I would average about 30 to 35 miles per gallon with it.

There is plenty of room in both the front and rear seats of this car.  The driver can put the seat back and still give room to your passengers in the back.  And the dual front air bags and standard safety belts ensure that everyone will be safe and happy when you get to your final destination.

One of the two problems I have with this vehicle is that it is front wheel drive.  I always loved driving rear wheel drive cars.  This is not really a problem, but more of a preference of mine.  I'm happy with the front wheel drive though.  It still gets the job done.

The other problem I have is with the brakes.  They seem to wear down a lot with this car.  I seem to be replacing the pads more often than I used to with my old cars.  Friends have told me that this is just normal with Chevy brakes, that they are worse than other makes.

Either way I found that the Lumina is a very reliable car.  I am just sad to see that Chevy had to pull the plug on such a fine automobile.
