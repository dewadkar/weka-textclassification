               I purchased my 1992 Bonneville SE about 6 months ago when my then-primary car became less than reliable.  It cost me just over $6000 and had just over 86,000 miles on it.  I'm used to driving older and larger vehicles (Buicks and minivans), so the problems that others have had with the vehicle's size haven't bothered me.  In fact, I prefer having some sheet metal around me in case of an accident and being able to comfortably transport my friends and belongings.

  Of the other people I have talked with who have owned one or have driven mine, only the owners of compact cars have had any problems adjusting to it's size.  One word of caution for shorter people though: the rear dash can be hard to see over on occasion.  But, with the power seats, this hasn't been a large problem for anyone I know.
 
  Being the SE model, it doesn't have the super-charger and some of the other great options that come on the high-end models.  Not that my car has any limit of options: I have power windows, locks, seats, and antenna.  A good AM/FM cassette player, a full analog dash, stereo controls on the leather-wrapped steering wheel, an on-the-floor shifter, etc.  But, if you are a techno-geek, like me, and want the really big toys -- like the super-charger, traction control and HUD (heads up display), then I'd recommend getting the SSE or SSEI models.

   Over all, it has a sporty appearance, and even without the super-charger it is quite responsive when I press on the accelerator.  I do have some problems with the sports suspension though -- you can feel just about every bump in the road.  Depending upon what you're used to driving, this may not be as noticeable as it first was to me.  The bucket seats are very comfortable, and give good support even when I am driving for hours on end.<br><br>
