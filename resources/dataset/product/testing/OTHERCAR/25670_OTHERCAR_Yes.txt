            We bought our 1995 Nissan Sentra GLE new in August 1995, in Phoenix, Arizona.  It has been a very reliable, affordable, and comfortable car for this category.

We previously owned a 1991 Sentra E, which was also a very good and basic car.  The 1995 model (loaded with options) is a much improved vehicle.  We opted for every possible option, except 4-wheel ABS, and haven't regretted any of it.

The vehicle has never had a mechanical problem, except a new air compressor at about 4 1/2 years (1999), which occurred under the original extended warranty (good thing--5year/60,000mi) so it was completely covered by Nissan.  Otherwise, the cost would have been $950 for Nissan to do everything.  Keep in mind that Phoenix, Arizona is a horrible place for the life of air compressors in cars.

The only downfall I would express would be the lack of power.  It is a little slow and exciting when merging onto a freeway or busy street.  I guess the payoff is decent mileage, about 25MPG for us (A/C always on).  

We had no trouble with the power accessories (windows,locks,etc.), no leaks including the power moonroof, and no strange noises.

I recommend the car to anyone looking for dependable transportation for 2-4 people (or two adults and two rear child seats).  I don't think a better choice can be made in this price range.
