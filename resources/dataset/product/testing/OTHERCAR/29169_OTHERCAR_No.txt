            In 1998 I purchased a 1992, 2 door Dodge Shadow, in the fabulous color white.  It was my first car and I was delighted to have it.  At the time it cost me around $3500.  The car had two heavy doors, spoiler, hatchback, CD player, and a post factory installed sunroof.

The nice thing about the car was the hatch back, for an artist with large paintings and sculptures to cart around, I swear this car had a never-ending trunk & back seat.  Another good thing about the car was that it was made of steel and had a thick rubber bumper.  I've been rear ended two times, once in a blizzard and another time by a drunk driver... both times I was left with little or no noticeable damage... the worst was a gouge in the bumper.

<b>Repairs I Had to Get Over a 3 Year Period:</b>
-radiator needed to be replaced and engine cleaned as a result ($1100)
-transmission problems (the car shifted violently at low speeds - $100)
-multiple wiper motors that just died ($110 each time) [rain-x is great, but, it doesn&#146t replace wipers]
-several car batteries that just died in the cold or after long drives ($75 each)
-electrical problems with tail lights and turn signals ($300 after multiple repairs)
-constant leaking of coolant into the engine
-linkage would shift the car into neutral when pushing the gas pedal hard ($500)
-at least one muffler & exhaust system ($200 but, I live in a place where salt and snow are common)
-shocks ($150)

Without all the mechanical problems, the car had issues with it's appearance as well.  The paint began to flake off in large chunks on the roof, hood, and trunk (I noticed this a lot in the white and blue models).  The doors rusted so badly I was afraid they'd fall off the car, and eventually my spoiler and sunroof sprung leaks, so that every time it rained I cursed if I didn't have several towels with me.

As far as the ride was concerned... if I held the door close against the frame with my left hand while driving, I *might* be able to hear my passenger or the radio.  The car had really bad wind noise and had lots of other annoying squeaks and knocks.  The seats though, were really soft and comfy.  After I bought my new car, drove it for a few weeks and then returned to my shadow to drive it to the store, I felt like I just jumped into a rickety go kart.

One thing this car gave me that no other car ever did, was a sense of community.  Every time I saw another poor sap driving a Shadow like mine, I'd look at them with a knowing sad glance and always got the same look in return.
