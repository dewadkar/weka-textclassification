            I purchased this '96 used with 58,000 miles. From day one it was obvious I had made a mistake. Finally insisted the dealer take it back for a '98 Lincoln Navigator. Will happen in a week.
My first impression of comfort, interior size with 7 passenger (with rear jump seats) capability, handling and &quot;gadgets galore&quot; (including 2 sun-roofs, more storage pockets and places for &quot;things&quot; than I have ever seen in a vehicle, left side dash volume controls, etc., etc., etc.) had me in love with this SUV for about three weeks. Then it started ..... 1) &quot;Bucking&quot; problem that could not be fixed by the dealer I purchased it from, so I took it to Land Rover for a one hour computer diagnostic that said the valves were gone (they weren't) that LR could fix for only $1,900.
2)Auto-dimmer rearview mirror leaked the oil between the 2 glass pieces which the LR dealer could replace (not available anywhere else, as with almost every part on this vehicle) for &quot;only&quot; $535, installed.
3) Other mechanical issues that shouldn't happen with less than 65,000 miles, including: the suspension, itermit. failure of the power window switches, electric seat buttons broke off 3x (I did not abuse them), trim falling down around driver's window, etc. I could go on with many more if I had room. I had checked the VIN# and it wasn't a &quot;bad title&quot;.  <br><br>
