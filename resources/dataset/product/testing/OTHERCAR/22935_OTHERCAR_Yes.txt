            My 1995 Caprice Classic is actually a former police car which saw duty with the Plano (TX) Police Department and was retired with 81,000 miles.  The police Caprices came factory-equipped with the 9C1 option (on which the Impala SS is loosely based), which turns this car into a true musclecar in disguise.

Plenty of motivation is provided by the same 260HP LT1 350 Chevrolet V8 that the Impala has, and four-wheel ABS disc brakes haul your family to a halt.  Freeway gas mileage is surprising good (the EPA rated it at 33mpg, but I haven't verified this), but in-town mileage is noticeable poorer.  Of course, your mileage may vary.

The interior has cloth bucket front seats (with armor plate in the seat backs!), a vinyl bench rear seat (with two 3-point belts and a center lap belt), and a rubber floor in lieu of carpet.  Perfect for kids - just hose that sucker out once a week!  

If you're expecting a cushy ride, though, you'll probably be disappointed.  The police-packaged Caprices got a suspension with stiff shocks and springs (stiffer than the Impala, even), which means you'll be feeling every bump and crack in the road.  Coupled with the big front and rear swaybars, though, the car handles surprisingly well for an automobile of its size.

Of course, there are a bunch of small, annoying little 'cop' features.  Things like the interior dome light not coming on when you open a door, the passenger seat being offset to make room for the police console, and the rear doors or windows not opening from the inside (kind of like permanent child locks).  Some of them even come with their spotlights still attached (mine didn't).

The technically-inclined person can undo all of this with no difficulty, but if you have small children, then this may be a feature.  It's definitely not a car for your silver-haired Aunt Martha*, but if you want a cheap Impala SS or just a family car that hauls more than groceries, then the 9C1-optioned Caprice definitely fits the bill.

* Any resemblance to your real-life silver-haired Aunt Martha is purely coincidental. I swear.<br><br>
