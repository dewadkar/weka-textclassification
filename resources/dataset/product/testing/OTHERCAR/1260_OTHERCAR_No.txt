            I bought a Nikon Coolpix 990 camera on June 23.

When I unpacked the camera, I noticed that some of the software that was supposed to be in the box was not there, but--in its place--was a piece of yellow paper referring the buyer to a &quot;24 hour, 7 day telephone support number&quot;

I called the number at about 8:25 PM, EDT and got a series of recordings that told me that &quot;...your call is important; please continue to hold and we will be with you shortly....&quot;

I continued to hold for 50 minutes and, finally, a live person answered.  After giving him my name, address, phone number and the serial number of my new camera, he said that there was nothing he could do for me and that I would have to call *the same number* again, Monday through Friday, during normal business hours.

I replied that this level of &quot;customer support&quot; was unacceptable, especially since I had paid over $1,000 that same day and would not be able to use all of the camera's features without the missing software.

This way of handling customers is outrageous.

I would suggest to anyone even remotely considering buying any Nikon product that they call Nikon USA prior to buying and ask for Nikon's assurance that some *real* customer support will be forthcoming.<br><br>
