            I first saw the Chrysler PT Cruiser at an Auto Show last winter. I was anxious to see it because I had already, even by that time, read so much about it. Give Chrysler�s publicity people credit � they�ve gotten a billion dollars worth of free press for this.

I was surprised by how little attention it was attracting at the Auto Show and more surprised about how little it was. I guess with all the hype I was expecting something the size of the Ford Expedition. Instead it was smaller than the smallest minivan. 

Either you love the retro look or you don�t. To me it looks a little phony � you know, kind of �faux retro� if there is such a thing. It looks like the kind of thing people rush out to buy in order to be noticed and that just isn�t me.

In order of importance here�s what I look for when buying a car:

&gt;&gt;&gt;Reliability (Based primarily on the Consumer Reports owner survey)
&gt;&gt;&gt;Size/Comfort
&gt;&gt;&gt;Fun
&gt;&gt;&gt;Safety
&gt;&gt;&gt;Solid �Feel� Inside and Out
&gt;&gt;&gt;Power/Zip/Acceleration/Torque
&gt;&gt;&gt;Versatility
&gt;&gt;&gt;Attractive Styling
&gt;&gt;&gt;Mileage

Remember, this is an OPINION. This is how I buy a car and what�s important to ME Your list and what is important to you will be different. 

Years ago I reluctantly loaned my brand new car to a friend for a week in an emergency. He recently paid me back by leaving me his 2 month old Limited Edition PT Cruiser for 10 days while he was away on vacation. (The only difference was that I didn�t return it to him with a dent in the rear like mine had when I got it back!) My only limitation was that I wasn�t allowed to drive it in heavy traffic � i.e. to work. So I got up earlier and beat the traffic!

Let�s cheat and give the important news up front. Would I buy this? No. Why? I think there are far better cars on the road in this price range. Earlier this year I bought a 2000 Nissan Maxima GLE which passed all of the above requirements with flying colors except possibly for versatility.

I�m also not the type that wants to be the center of attention and believe me � if you are � you will get plenty of attention until enough of these hit the road in the coming months. Right now it�s still a novelty. People stopped me in parking lots, others rolled down their windows at stop lights, toll takers and garage attendants queried me etc. 

All this for a modestly performing, relatively inexpensive vehicle that makes good use of interior space. It just shows you the value of style and marketing. To me it looks like something �The Fonz� would drive in the winter. I fully appreciate those that look at this and fall in love. It�s just a matter of taste. The styling is certainly clever � it just isn�t for me.

Lets�s run down my list and see how the Cruiser fared:


&gt;&gt;&gt;Reliability � This is a new model so Consumer Reports won�t have any survey responses until next February or possibly February 2002. My experience has dictated that the manufacturers rush their cars to market and work out the kinks based on what the public find to be the problems. In other words, if you buy a new model in its first few years you are a human guinea pig.

This is, however, a Chrysler and the car is built on the Dodge Neon platform. That�s right, if you were expecting a large vehicle remember what it was built on. Chrysler and the Neon in particular are not exactly known as high quality vehicles when compared to the offerings of Toyota, Honda and Nissan for instance. To be fair however, there is no real owner survey data yet on the PT Cruiser. So while the jury is out I�d guess this to be a C based on its lineage and the nature of new models in general.


&gt;&gt;&gt;Size/Comfort � The  exterior of the vehicle puts this in the Toyota RAV class as opposed to a Ford Expedition but the interior is surprisingly roomy. The seats can be configured a number of different ways to suit your needs. The rear seats are fully removable allowing what seems like acres of room when you need it. While the Cruiser is actually shorter than a Neon it has a generous 120 cubic feet of interior room. Thus, even though it�s a somewhat smallish car (actually SUV by definition) it can hold as much as the biggest (minus the seats and people) when you need the cargo room. This was extremely attractive to me. The versatility gets an A+. The seats get a B+. A little thin and on the cheap side. This was not meant to be a luxury vehicle given the modest (by today�s standards) list price.


&gt;&gt;&gt;Fun � Plenty of that! A+


&gt;&gt;&gt;Safety � I have to put this at least fourth out of guilt. The truth is I never think of this and just assume all cars are similar which is completely wrong of course. I haven�t seen the government tests so I can�t report on safety beyond that dual airbags are standard. This Limited Edition also comes with side airbags in the front. This being the high end model, it also came with traction control and anti lock brakes. It IS a smallish car so obviously won�t fare as well as a truck in a collision. Duh.


&gt;&gt;&gt;Solid �Feel� Inside and Out � I felt that this looked like what it was, a vehicle listing for under $20,000. This isn�t a bad thing. Just don�t expect a Lexus cuz ya ain�t gonna find it here. The materials used are somewhat on the modest side. Functional � not luxurious, but not cheap either. In a way it fits better. Chrysler didn�t put Grecian columns on a ranch house. 

There were a couple of squeaks which were annoying which I find typical on American cars but otherwise the fit and finish were fine. The doors, trunk and hood all �thunked� with authority. The paint job was beautiful but how it hold up over time is the real key. Overall. I�d give the Cruiser a B in the �Solid Feel� category.


&gt;&gt;&gt;Power/Zip/Acceleration � Very disappointing for something designed to look like a 1950s muscle car. It has a 4 cylinder 2.4 liter dual overhead cam engine with 150 HP. Plenty of power for most needs but the power belies the skin of the car which says VROOOOOMMMM and gives you only vroom. I�d give it a C at best in this category. An optional turbocharger would be nice but is not available.


&gt;&gt;&gt;Versatility � As noted above the Cruiser makes excellent use of space and with the fold down or removable seats you can have yourself a small truck. Definitely an A+ in this department!


&gt;&gt;&gt;Attractive Styling � This is so subjective it isn�t fair to rate it. While I�ll honestly say that this isn�t my taste I understand why others would love it to the point of living with its shortcomings. I give Chrysler credit for taking a chance with this.


&gt;&gt;&gt;Mileage � I got 22 MPG in combined city/highway driving. This was about what I�d expect. No better or worse. I have to give only a B+ as I get the same mileage in my 6 cylinder Maxima with a 222 HP engine.


Overall, this is not a bad vehicle but I trust that most sales will be made on the styling and fun to drive factors. Its reliability has yet to be proven. This car, loaded in Limited Edition trim was listed for about $20,000 � not a bad value at all. Don�t, however, order one on looks alone without a test drive.
