            My mother bought this car about two years ago. I have ridden in it a few times since she has had it and driven it twice. It is a roomy car made for hauling kids around but as far as handling goes, it is not good at all. She has had to take it in for repair far more often than she should have for a variety of problems. Just recently the brakes have been going out and need to be replaced. Even WORSE, the week after she purchased it she was already back at the dealership getting the air conditioning fixed because it was blowing room temp air only.... no cold air, which is much needed in Florida. As far as having space for her to carry luggage or other large objects goes it is good, but for a top of the line mini-van, it has poor handling and many problems that arise far to often, which require too much time in the shop.<br><br>
