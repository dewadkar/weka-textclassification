            I purchased a 1999 Honda Odyssey minivan in late 1998 and I couldn't be happier with it.  
My main concern was reliability after owning several &quot;lemon&quot; minivans.  So far the Odyssey has performed perfectly with no non-maintenance visits to the shop.  The ride is quiet and the acceleration is not bad for a 4-cylinder.
I think one of the things that set the Odyssey apart from some other minivans I looked at was the ease of moving the seats.  My van's setup is the 2 captains chairs in front, split bench in the middle, and full bench in the back.  The full bench in the back drops down level with the floor of the minivan with two quick turns of a knob.  Either side of the split bench in the middle folds up flush with the front row of seats.  No more removing an entire bench (that probably weighs 50 pounds).
Overall I'm very happy with my Odyssey.  I think it's the best value in the minivan class.<br><br>
