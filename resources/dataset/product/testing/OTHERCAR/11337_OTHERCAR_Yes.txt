            We bought a 99 dodge grand caravan this spring because we had a 95 dodge caravan and loved it and it was time to replace our 88 dodge shadow.

The main thing I don't like is that it gets lower gas mileage than our 95 does (whether that is due to it being grand or not, I don't know)-about 18 mpg (doesn't seem to matter if it is highway or city).  The seats are kind of heavy to remove but can be done.


We find the 99 dodge grand caravan to be so comfortable.  We have the quad seating and although I didn't think I would like it, I do.  We also have the 4 doors which is a must if you are buying it where you have an option! It is so easy to get into and out of.  The rear heating/air is a great feature as well.

Driving the grand is just like driving a car although it is hard to tell where the end of the hood is.  It is smooth and quiet and has great pickup.


I personally don't see us buying a car ever again, even when our kids our grown due to the comfort and roominess of the grand caravan!<br><br>
