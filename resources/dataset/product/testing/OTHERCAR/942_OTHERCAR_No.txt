            My husband bought this car and it was the worst car we ever owned. It seemed like a good deal at the time. It was reasonably priced and was a nice size not too small and not too big. But this car was very undependable. We had numerous problems with it from day one. 

It had a very bad vibration when driven at 60mph. The wind noise was so loud that conversation was impossible. The battery died when the car was only a couple months old. We had to replace the break pads every 8000 miles. The rotors warped real easy too. We constantly had problems with the transmission. It would get stuck in gear and would not shift. That was scary! 

There was a bearing that went out in the fan motor that we had to fix because every time we took it in to the dealer to get anything fixed, they would keep it for a week then say it's fine. The seatbelts were messed up and would tear the door panels. The dashboard had a very loud annoying rattle. The clock would not keep time. The car had major electrical problems. The A/C did not work right. It would quite blowing cold and make a terrible sound. 

Right before we got rid of it the wind shield wiper on the passenger side quit working. This car only had 45k miles on it and had all these problems. We could not trade it in because we owed more on it then it was worth. We tried to sell it but no one would buy it. About the only thing good I can say is that is was good on gas mileage. I would not recommend this car to anyone at all!<br><br>
