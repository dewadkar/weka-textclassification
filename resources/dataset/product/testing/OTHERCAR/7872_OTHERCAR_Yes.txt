            If you are looking for visibility and presence on the road, Toyota gives them to you with the 2003 Toyota Sequoia.  It can haul more than 5,000 pounds of passengers and cargo.  All of your hauling needs are met all of a sudden.  Just for your information, the Sequoia is great for large-size families.  It can seat up to 8 people without any trouble.  Having been a huge fan of the top Japanese automaker for many years now, I have been trying to keep track of the record numbers of SUVs it has put on the market.  There is no doubt that the Sequoia is the middle vehicle between the smaller 4Runner and the more lavish Land Cruiser.  I have remained fond of these two vehicles too.  What's great about the Sequoia is the opportunity to have yours customized.  A colleague of mine just had one customized for his family.  I must say that he had to pay a bit more, of course, for all these additions and options.

<b>  How does the Sequoia fare in front of its major competitors?</b>

If you are looking for something longer and wider than the Chevrolet Tahoe and about the same size as the 2003 Ford Expedition, then go for the Sequoia.  After all, Toyota brings you this vehicles with all guarantees of reliability, durability and superb engineering.  It's true that Chevrolet has managed to stage a coup with the Tahoe, one of the best-selling SUVs among the up and mobile Gen-Xers.  By its sheer size, the Sequoia commands respect and admiration at the same time.  It's a big vehicle that causes many head-turns on the roads.  It's a huge powerplant on wheels, if we consider that it comes with a standard 4.7-liter V8 engine.  I had a blast test-driving this SUV.  I had superb visibility.  My kids who were with me enjoyed mostly the rear-seat DVD entertainment system.  It comes with two cordless headphones.  What else should they have taken fancy in?  While I was smitten by the driveability and smoothness of the truck, they were enjoying the entertainment system, which is also an option on the SR5, the other trim.

<b>What you should know about the 2003 Sequoia</b>

It comes in two trim levels.  They are the base SR5 and the option-packed Limited.  The Limited features new 17-inch alloy wheels, load-leveling rear suspension, great drivetrain, ergonomics, quality, high-tech safety features etc.   

As the largest of Toyota's five sport-utility vehicles, the Sequoia offers great safety features:  front airbags, ABS, skid control, traction control.  The warranty on the Sequoia is 3 years or 36,000 miles.  In a lot of ways, the Sequoia is more appealing than many of its competitors on the market.

<b>Recommendations</b>

The Sequoia is a great truck to own.  If  you want to keep it for a long time, it'll be worth the investment.  It's a huge jump from the regular Toyota sedans.
