            Thw WRX seduced me to end my love affair with Toyotas after 20 years. I live in the mountains, needed AWD, and wanted to simplify from having BOTH a regular 4 seat daily driver AND a 2 seat fun machine. The answer was a WRX.

Other reviewers have written plenty about how fun this thing is to drive, and I agree. Its a kick, especially on curvy mountain backroads. With a lower seating position, I'd never lust for another 2 seat, rag top pocket rocket again.

But after 15,000 miles, I do have some concerns about build quality and Subaru's commitment to customer satisfaction. More problems have cropped up in my first 15,000 miles than in 4 Toyotas over two decades.

The alignment went out of whack, requiring the front brakes and the two worn front tires to be replaced. I'm waiting for Subaru's decision on whether the tires will be covered under the warranty. Subaru, it seems, has a cumbersome warranty pre-approval process that makes your HMO seem responsive.

The "break-away" mirror on the passenger side, well, broke away - not sure how - but then didn't flip back. Subaru agrees its a design flaw, and has redesigned the mirror (and will replace this one under warranty.) But when I asked if the driver's side mirror could also be replaced with the new, redesigned one, I was told "Not until it breaks." I felt like going out to the car and hitting it to make it pop, so they'd replace it. If it breaks away after my warranty is up, hey, its my $200 repair! Their approach seems pretty cheap to me.

The 4 speed manual shift is not real smooth (and, hey, I've owned a LOT of manual shift vehicles). It periodically won't go into reverse without putting into first and going forward a bit first. Even my Ford Ranger truck doesn't have that problem. Subaru says that's just the way it is. But in a sports-tuned car, the shift mechanism should get a little more attention.

The interior is a disappointment. I don't mind the cheap plastic (I knew I wasn't buying a $40K German luxury car), but it could use more than one cup holder! The seats are waaay comfortable, but the upholstery is impossible to keep clean. Lint rollers are the only thing that will get up dog hair, and the blue mesh doesn't clean easily.

There are a few other niggling problems, like wiper blades that didn't last past 13K miles, but I won't go into detail here.

Overall, though, it doesn't seem like Subaru is very concerned about making me a happy, contented owner --- who will buy again. The company seems more interested in selling me an extended warranty and accessories (I've received about a half dozen mailings about that) than in finding out how I like my car (they've never sent me a survey questionairre.) Both Toyota (who built my last 4 cars) and Ford (who built my last 2 trucks) regularly questioned me about my experience.
