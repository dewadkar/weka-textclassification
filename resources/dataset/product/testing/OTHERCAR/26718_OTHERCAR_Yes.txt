            I had a small Casio digital camera and was not happy with the quality of the pictures when they were printed. I started to look for a &quot;better&quot; camera at a reasonable price. Boy, did I find one! 
The Olympus D-360L, in my humble opinion, is one great little camera. Relatively easy to use, lightweight, compact and top-notch pictures (at SHQ) for a nice price. The flash card memory makes it easy to carry extra &quot;film&quot; and very easy to load onto a PC with a flash card adapter that fits into a floppy drive. 
I used the camera this past week for pictures of the family at Christmas which I will now print up for the non-computer literate and post on my website for the computer literate. Ditto for the pictures of the house I am buying out west, my brother-in-laws retirement party, etc. No more film to buy. 
Make sure that you buy extra flashcards and batteries, I recommend rechargeable ones, and remember to carry them with you. The D-360L is also remarkably durable (being a klutz, I have dropped it several times without and adverse effects) much to the relief of my better half. 
Easy to buy, easy to travel with, way to use, I highly recommend the Olympus D-360L <br><br>
