            This is a great camera for point and shoot users. It boots up in about 3 seconds for fast use on the go, and can shoot stills one after the other. There is also a burst mode that can allow you to analyse your golf swing if you want, or even make an mpeg movie. 

It's ease of use is what persuaded me to buy this camera, it has auto-focus and metering, and you can simply turn off the flash or set it for portraits with one touch of the directional pad on the back. 

Viewing the photos is easy, I would have to say of all the LCD screens I have seen on cameras, this one is really good for viewing in broad daylight. It also has good colour so you don't delete that questionable photo based on poor LCD quality. It also comes with a video cable to plug into any television for crisp viewing on your set.

It comes with it's own USB cable, 2 AA rechargeable batteries and charger! In a time where camera companies are shipping out proprietary battery packs for their products, it is nice to see a company using standard AA rechargeables that are much cheaper than a 100 dollar battery pack.

Software isn't too bad, You get the typical lite photo-editing software. Of course you can spring for Photoshop and throw away whatever comes with this camera, that is if you didn't have to scrounge for money to buy this camera. Which brings up another point, this camera has been around for a while, thus the price has dropped significantly in most stores, expect to find this unit for somewhere around the 300-350 dollar range.

If at first you think the camera looks a little strange, you must realize that SONY does pack quite a bit of electronics into this relatively small enclosure. It is also more ergonomic than it's smaller competition as it has more heft and is easier to hold with two hands. This makes for more steady shots.

The features are easy to access with the simple dial and directional pad, you will be surfing through settings in no time. The sensitivity is 100-400 ISO and the auto white balance is pretty accurate. The flash is ok, and the zoom is somewhat better than standard with a 3X optical, 2X digital. I just turn off the digital zoom anyhow.

The worst part of buying a digital camera is getting the insulting memory stick size they throw in the package, and SONY does nothing to stop this trend. You get a paltry 16 megabyte memory stick, which is great if you also own a Cliï¿½ because then you have a decent sized PDA memory stick. I suggest running out and buying at least a 64 for the time being. memory sticks will drop in price eventually as larger sticks are introduced. 

Furthermore, you will be somewhat disappointed if you expect to have all the manual functions of a regular film camera as this is strictly point and shoot. It's simplicity and ease of use may be annoying for some of you experienced photographers.

The last item that bothers me is the lack of sound on the mpeg video mode, but I have a digital camcorder for recording video so it is not a big deal. Mind you, one should never try to buy a digital still camera to take movies as one should never buy a digital camcorder to take still shots. The two are just not integrated together well enough, we'll see what technology provides us in the coming years. Until then, dual function cameras like that are far too expensive.

All in all, a great camera. I love it, it works great, it is  durable in construction, and works flawlessly with my Mac and iPhoto.
