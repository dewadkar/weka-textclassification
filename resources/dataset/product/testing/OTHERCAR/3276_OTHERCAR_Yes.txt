            Since my 2001 Toyota Celica GT was just too small to squeeze in and out of every day I upgraded to a 2002 Toyota Solara convertible. It's a beautiful car in every respect. The V6 engine is a flawless performer which still gets reasonable gas mileage. The automatic transmission shifts smoothly in all ranges. Brakes are superb. After driving a Celica for nine months and becoming used to its precise handling characteristics I thought the Solara would be on the stodgy side but it certainly isn't. Handling is very competent even with the added weight of the convertible. Interior appointments are luxurious. The leather seats fit me well. The power driver's seat adjustments are such that almost anyone can find a comfortable driving position. Adjustable head restraints are an added plus. The rear seat is especially roomy for a two-door car, a nice surprise. The climate control system is fantastic, instant heating and cooling, a quiet fan even on higher speeds and simple controls. The JBL sound system is a real goodie with a 6-disc in-dash CD changer and plenty of speakers including a sub woofer. Bass is sometimes a bit disconcerting because of the sub woofer but adjustments are plentiful. If there is to be a criticism of the interior, maybe even nitpicking, it would be that there is no lock on the center console compartment. Some folks would like to make a quick stop and leave the top down but don't want to leave the console accessible, hence the lock. My own thought is, "Lock you car and take your key". Auto theft rates are not going down any time soon. Speaking of the convertible top, it is power operated and works very smoothly. It has a glass rear window with a defroster grid. A welcome feature is that all the windows go down automatically when the top goes down. The tonneau or boot cover takes up valuable trunk space if you decide to haul it around with you. It's also a bit difficult to install. I don't use it much. Another appreciated feature is the UV deflecting side windows. They really work and eliminate the need for window tinting, a very popular item where I live in the southwest. So other than a relatively small trunk the car is perfect. I am looking forward to several years of proud ownership. Toyota's reputation for excellent cars lives on in the Solara.
