            The Toyota Camry is a great car. This car is reliable, safe, and loaded with features. I feel this car is made for the road whether it is a quick trip to the store, commute to work, or drive cross country. My family has one and we have used this car to travel across several states. we had three kids in the back as well. This car is compact but two adults sit comfortably in the back seat. The colors and design of the car is slick as is the handling. The break system is very good, I feel safe in this car. This car also has the adjustable shoulder strap seatbelt which adds safety to those smaller individual drivers as well as tilt steering. I have put little maintenance into the car and it runs top notch. <br><br>
