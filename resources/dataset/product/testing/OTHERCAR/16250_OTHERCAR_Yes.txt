            My wife purchased this car in the summer of '98 and had been happy with this car until recently.  In fact, if you asked her until 1 month ago, she would tell you that she would not even consider an American car, and absolutely loved her car.

Overall, the car is an excellent value for the money and is a quality made vehicle.  However, the displeasure with this car began after a minor, and I mean minor accident.  Some fool who just pulled out in front of her on a highway service road cut her off.  She maneuvered around this fool and unfortunately hit the curb (a very low one).  The resultant damage to the car in my opinion cannot possibly be justified.  The entire front left suspension system needed to be replaced in an accident that almost any other car would have just gone over the curb.  Let's forget about if the damage should have occurred or not...

The real problem began when trying to obtain replacement parts from Toyota for this car.  Every single dealer on Long Island was unable to obtain parts for this car, turning a weeklong repair, at worst, to a one-month ordeal.  Because this car had ABS (anti-lock) brakes, not one part was available that had anything to with the suspension.  Numerous times Toyota dealers sent incorrect part or for the wrong side due.  This of course speaks poorly not only for Toyota but for the dealers as well.  More than one of the dealers that sent incorrect part had won some kind of quality award from Toyota.  After the car was repaired, another component failed and again, another week went by before the part could be obtain, and yes, the wrong part was delivered from one dealer during that time.

In all fairness, we will not all have accidents, but then again, it is inevitable that someone will and this is not the experience that someone should have with any car, let alone one from a company that prides itself on quality.  I guess that quality only goes as far as design and manufacture.  For those that need something when things go wrong, too bad!

Of course out of the bad came something good.  The second time that the car was in for repair we were given a Ford Focus and to be honest, the car appeared just as nice as the Corolla and I found it to be much roomier than the Toyota although just a tad bit noisier than the Corolla.
Needless to say my wife has decided to sell the Toyota and is seriously considering the Focus...
