            When my husband and I first started looking at a &quot;minivan&quot;, I was not real excited about the idea.  However, we recently had our second child and frankly the SUV we were driving at the time, just wasn't cutting it anymore.  I thought by buying a minivan, I was giving up style and performance.  I found the Dodge Grand Caravan to be just the opposite.   As a busy working mom, I LOVE IT!!!!  <br><br>I find the performance to be much more than I ever expected from a &quot;minivan&quot;.  It is extremely convenient with our small children in two car seats.  I can even change diapers in the van when I need to.  It is also extremely easy to get to the rear seat.  The stereo system is also a plus.  The drive is easy and smooth.<br><br>We bought our minivan used, as I would recommend anyone do.  We were able to get all the features we want on the used van that we probably would not have been able to afford on a brand new one.<br><br>Those parents in fear of driving a &quot;family vehicle&quot; should put their fears aside and try it . . . .you might just like it!!!!<br><br><br>
