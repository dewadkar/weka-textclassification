            Growing up in an age where sporty and sleek (in terms of cars)is more predominant than safety, I see where car buyers can be easily swayed from buying a reliable car. I have a 1993 Subaru Legacy Sedan. It's not sporty, it's not exactly sleek, but it's SAFE!!! 

With front wheel drive, anti-lock brakes, and a driver's side airbag, I feel very safe driving through whatever Mother Nature throws at us. This car rides so smoothly and quietly, you will be very impressed. I recently drove my mother's and brother's cars (a '99 Saturn sedan, and a '97 Mercury Tracer-respectively), and was surprised to find that my '93 provided a much quieter, smoother ride than both of those cars. I must admit that this wouldn't be my first choice if I were out car shopping, but since it's the car I've got, I'm very grateful, and very pleased with its performance. 

The only bad thing I can think of about foreign cars is the upkeep. If parts break or wear out, they are often VERY expensive to replace. But it's worth it if you keep the car in good condition. Anyone will tell you that if you take care of your car, it'll go for hundreds of thousands of miles. My car is proof of that. I'm well past 100,000 miles, and my car is running great (knock on wood).

So, if you're looking for a new car, keep Subaru in mind. They have a great reputation, and rightly so.  <br><br>
