            I bought my 1993 Toyota Corolla in July of 1998.  After my mom's car died, I was looking for a decent used car that would hopefully last me through college.

I am happy to say that I have never had any problems with this car.  I've owned my Corolla for 5 years now.  It's 10 years old, and I've never had to bring it into the mechanic for anything other than regular maintenance.  This is a VERY reliable car!

When I first got the car, it had 103,000 miles on it.  It now has close to 150,000 miles.  Over time, it has started shifting harder when I am on the interstate.  It has overdrive, which is very useful as I occasionally drive 4 1/2 hours away to visit my family.  It only shifts hard when moving into the final gear.  It's not too bad of a thing since it does shift with no trouble.  I don't have to floor the gas to force it to shift or anything like that.  This is simply the only time when I can feel the car shift (which isn't something you could say about most 10 year old cars with 150,000 miles).  Once it gets up to about 70-80 mph, have fun trying to slow the thing down because it loves to go fast.  Sometimes, I just take my foot off the gas and let it coast.  My Toyota just loves to go 80mph... and after 10 years and 150,000 miles, the car doesn't shake at all when going that fast.

The only other problem I've had with my Toyota is that it's started burning oil within the last 2 years.  This is something that will happen to any car once it reaches a certain age and mileage.  It doesn't burn very much, but I do make sure to check the oil before going on long trips just in case.

Most of the wear on my car can be blamed on the fact that I moved to Massachusetts.  People are really hard on their cars here.  If you go any slower than 75 on the Mass Pike, be lucky if you don't get flipped off or even killed.
