            Buy a Hyundai? Why not? Being a new car nut (buying one every two years) I am always looking for a good car and a great value. The Hyundai Sonata meets both of these factors for me. 

While Hyundai has not been on the top of anyone's list for years, their new 10 year 100,000 mile warranty caught my attention. I felt they deserved a new look if they were confident enough to put out this kind of backing for their product.

The Sonata is a mid-size car comparable to the Toyota Camry and Ford Taurus, but at a great price. A loaded Sonata with all the bells and whistles priced out $4,000+ less than the Camry and the Taurus. BANG FOR THE BUCK! On top of the price difference I get the warranty that blows away Toyota and Ford. Both the Toyota and Ford offer the standard 3 year 36,000 mile coverage. I drive over 20,000 miles per year and would eat that up in just over a year. The Hyundai coverage is what sold me on the car. 10 year 100,000 powertrain coverage, 5 year 75,000 bumper to bumper, and 5 year unlimited mileage roadside assistance. Need I say more?

While it will not win any awards for styling, it is still a nice looking 4 door sedan. Inside room is great in both the front and rear. At 6'2&quot; and the seat all the way back, there kids still have loads of room. Driving position is very comfortable for both the short and long haul trips. Auto, air, power windows, cruise, tilt, stereo etc... the car has it all, and again for a great price. The trunk will hold two sets of golf clubs easily, or plenty of luggage when traveling. Gas mileage has averaged 32 on the freeway and 28 in town. Great fit and finish, and a quiet, smooth ride.

In the ten months I have had the car it has run like a dream. No problems, rattles or squeaks. A very solid car. I have only had to change the oil and add gas. 

Great Car, Great Price!   <br><br>
