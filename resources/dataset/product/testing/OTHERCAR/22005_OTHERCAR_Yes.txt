                I bought this vehicle because I wanted a luxury car and this one was perfect for me.  I love its smooth ride, leather seats, CD player with a capacity of 6 CD's, the northstar system for those occasional times when I get lost or need to find some place, its built in car phone which includes speaker phone, and its sound system. I don't really hate anything about this car except for that it could be a little more spacious. It is truly awesome to drive this car. It's smooth, easy to handle, and also has speed.  If you love cars and use them a lot, and also enjoy a smooth ride I encourage you to seriously think about the purchase of this car.  It is just a real joy to have.

   It has great features too.  Like the controllable seats to fit the curves of anybody.  It has a great air conditioning system that can heat or cool the car in no time.  It also has great trunk capacity that can hold quite a bit.  I still believe that the Lexus is a joy to have and I have owned it now for about a year.  If you are into cars, enjoy great gadgets, and love a smooth ride this my friend is the car for you.
