<TEXT>
            The 96 VW Jetta was my first car. I was very excited because I always heard about people driving their cars for over 10 years. The day after I brought the car home it wouldn't start. The people at the dealership said I just didn't know how to shift the car. I said that could be true since this was my first stick shift but then I think the car should still turn over. 

In the 4 years I have had this car they had to replace the sound system twice. The power window switches once, and for the last year of ownership the check engine light has been on more than it has been off.

If someone tells you how great their Jetta is you can bet it wasn't the '96 model. I think that the only thing that made up for the crappy service record was the huge trunk and great gas mileage on long trips.

These have been the worst 4 years of my life with this car. I know some people are loyal VW owners but not I. I will not own another VW for a good long time.
