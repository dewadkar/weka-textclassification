            This year my 29-year-old brother bought one of this sporty fun filled jeeps so that he could enjoy his summer just a little more.  It is still cold where I live, but I am sure that when it gets sunny and the spring flowers come up that the top of the wrangler will be flying off.  The new wrangler is so much different then the old ones, yeah it might look similar, but they have changed drastically.

The Wrangler was completely redesigned and re-engineered for 1997 and the result was a vast improvement over its predecessors in every respect. Now it's quieter, roomier and more comfortable. All the more reason why my brother got this jeep, he is a big guy and it is very roomy for is long legs and big body.  Not only does it look better it rides better. It handles better. It's more capable off road. And it's affordable. 

One of the big decisions my brother made when buying his Wrangler was selecting the top.  I prefer the soft-top, a high-quality piece of equipment that seals off the weather pretty well. Folding the top down takes only a third of the time it took before, and if a screwdriver is handy, the windshield can be flipped down for breezy, low-speed touring in the back country, which we havenï¿½t done yet but will sure be fun. The side curtains, however, can be a hassle in everyday use. Stopping at a tollbooth in the rain can mean a lap full of water when the side curtain is unzipped. 

I would suggest getting a hard top because of its practicality. The hard top provides more security for expensive gear from rain damage or theft;  I am  uncomfortable leaving my wallet or anything worth something to me only protected  by fabric and clear plastic. The hard top also offers better protection from weather. It comes with full-height doors and wind-up windows. Driving one at dawn through a violent thunderstorm felt dry and secure Wind noise is greatly reduced. 

For those who want the best of both worlds, Jeep offers a package that includes both hard top and soft-top in matching colors. Either top is far easier to remove or install than tops of years past and provides much better sealing from the elements. 

Jeep Wrangler is an enjoyable companion on the highway and around town. And it just can't be beat off road.
