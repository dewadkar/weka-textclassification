            When everyone is tempted to buy the new C-5 Corvette, take a moment to consider a good (used) C-4.  While lacking some of the more dramatic body accents of the C-5, the C-4 is far less costly, and delivers more than adequate performance and looks.  I paid $23K for a very low mileage, mint condition convertible 1994 C-4.  The car has 300 h.p. stock, and with a minor &quot;bolt-on&quot; change in exhaust and  an electronic programmer, I have about 330 h.p..  The car will pin you back in the seat, from a dead stop,
a slow roll, or 70 m.p.h.  It stops pulling about 160 m.p.h., and drives at 150 like it's still at 80.

This is still not quite as much power as a new C-5 (345 h.p. stock) but is close enough, and for $20-30K LESS, the difference is nominal.  Most people see my car and ask if it's new. It's 6 years old but looks like it just came off the showroom floor.  More importantly, the styling is timeless, and only real corvette lovers will be able to tell the year.  Most people can't believe I paid less for my 'vette than they did for their Mustang or Pickup.

What are the tradeoffs for the old (C-4) vs. the new (C-5) other than Price and  Horsepower?  In the convertible models, the main and distinct advantage is that the C-5 has a much larger trunk, which can be accessed from the outside, like a conventional trunk.  The C-4's trunk is VERY small and can only be accessed from the inside, or by raising the back of the convertible roof.  Also, the interior of the C-4 is like a &quot;tub&quot; with a high ridge around the door panels.  This forces you to lift yourself up and over the ridge to get out.  Not too tough with practice, but  definitely not a convenience.  The C-5 body is constructed without this &quot;ridge&quot; and you need only to swing your legs out as you would normally. 

The BOSE stereo in the C-4 is nice, and has a Speed-Volume control which when activated raises the volume of the stereo as the car goes faster, to accommodate the engine-road noise.  This is a surprisingly nice feature, as many times when you adjust the volume on the highway, then slow for an exit or light, the radio is now too loud, especially with the top down. This feature lowers the volume, especially good for conversation with your passenger, then raises it again as you accelerate.  This not available in the C-5.

The car is low, stiff, and tight.  This means it can corner like nothing else, but every bump is registered on your butt.  Such is the nature of any sports car.  Several considerations on used C-4's.  The 93, 94, 95, 96 are almost identical.  Almost. Some minor changes.  For example, the 93 has driver air bag, the 94 and newer have both driver and passenger bags. The body is the same, but the frame is stronger in the 94 &amp; up, if safety is a concern.

The seats are remarkable. I have driven extended trips in many cars, but my corvette, despite the tight &quot;cockpit&quot;, NEVER fatigues me.  I can drive forever in this car.  Many times I have allotted a certain amount of driving time, anticipating fatigue based on past experience.  The corvette has fooled me each time and I have driven long past where I expected, because it just won't wear you out.

All in all, it's tightly quartered, rough ride, small, small storage, and will develop occasional and intermittent squeaks and rattles.  But I wouldn't trade it for anything but a new corvette (but not for the difference in money).  The packing space is very small, but all that means is that you pack efficiently, bring only what you need, and leave the junk home.  If you leave your companion home, you can bring a lot more.  With the corvette, you can always get another companion.


You may be out-dated, or out-priced, but you will never be outclassed.
