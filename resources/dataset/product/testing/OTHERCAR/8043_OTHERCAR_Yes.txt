            First off let me explain how I purchased my 4-door white 92'sl2 saturn. I traded my brother my washer and dryer(whirlpool) and my treadmill (5 years old, $1200 new(. I think I got a pretty good deal. The vehicle had 140,000 miles on it when I bought it and have put on 20,000 miles since. 

Besides the oil problem which is very common with these models, a quart needs added between every oil change. I have had only one problem: the temp sensor, one other sensor and battery needed replaced. I discovered this on a cold october morning when the vehicle wouldnt start. This set me back $290 which is substantial for me at this point until my finances are better, but hopefully I can get through the winter with out any major things needed done! The mechanic said he could fix the oil leak problem for about $800 and told me that if I didnt the leak would get more pronounced and would leak on my spark wires and cause further problems. This was an easy decision since I dont have the money I advised not to fix. Maybe I will eventually because the engine appears to run very smooth and the interior and body look almost new. People dont think that it is as old as it is. The car is smooth on the highway, and gets about 32 mph hiway, and 25 city. This vehicle has all the goodies leather interior, power everything, even a $600 stereo my brother threw in. Regarding that stereo my mechanic told me that the high powered stereo wore my battery out faster. Oh well! I like my tunes man, lol! The interior is fairly roomy for an above average size person, but considering Im 6'3" and 300lbs Its not exactly a cadilac for me, but Id say most people would fit in fine. 

Anyway bottom line is that for a $1000 which was about what I paid in value when totalin up my barter deal, Id say Im getting a pretty good deal. The jury is still out because Id like to get 200,000 on this baby, only time will tell!
