            The Chevy Malibu is the next car on my list that GM has requested I test drive, so test drive I did.  I have mixed feelings about the vehicle because of several areas. One thing you must remember is that you cannot compare this to the higher priced vehicles on the market because they are in a different class altogether.  You must compare it to other vehicles in the price range.

First, I would like to say that for the money the Malibu is a good vehicle to purchase. I feel that it is an average vehicle for its price tag of 16-19,000.  After driving it for a couple of days I find that it drives very similarly to the Saturn sedan.  Good response and braking for a vehicle of this caliber.

Second, the seating in the vehicle was rather uncomfortable.  I am a moderately large man and I felt a little uncomfortable in the drivers seat.  Better back support is needed.

Thirdly, the sound system is marginal.  It's not it sounds bad, because the speakers are of good quality, but the FM and AM reception I felt was poor.  I live in a suburb of a large city and even my 49.00 generic special in my other car had better reception that this one.  GM will be advised by me to put a better tuner in this radio.

Overall I would have to say that this is a good car for the middle income American family.  Adequate seating for 4, average trunk space, and good handling make this a good buy.  Even though is does have a sporty look to it, it does not really drive like a sports car but more like a family sedan.<br><br>
