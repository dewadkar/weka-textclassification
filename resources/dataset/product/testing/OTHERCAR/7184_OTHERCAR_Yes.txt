            What can I say about the Nissan Maxima in words that is strong enough to give an idea of how great it really is.  The car is simply great, and I'm not one to enjoy much else besides Ford.  However, this car proved to be a good ride for me.

It gets great gas mileage, some of the best I've ever seen.  The dealership has the gas mileage posted at around 21 miles to the gallon, but when we owned it, we actually did the math (several times to make sure this was right) and saw it reach as high as 30 miles to the gallon!!!  But realize that probably depended highly upon how we drove it.

It is quite a comfortable car to drive, and had plenty of room.  The storage space was about average for most cars, but the trunk was somewhat larger than most cars.  So depending on how you packed, you could fit a lot into this car.

The steering on the car was not too tight and not too loose.  And I noticed no play in it at all.  The car responded as soon as the wheel was moved.  We had a 3.3L V6 is ours, and it did very well on acceleration and speed.  Even the 3.0L engines did very well.

I have to admit that this was a very excellent car to come out of Nissan, and I can see why they have continued to make it for so long.<br><br>
