            <i>This review is written in memory of Mike Lambert, also known as Roadiem. Mike taught me more about tires than I ever realized I needed to know.</i>

Big Blue is my 2000 GMC half ton pick up. (Is it just a girl thing to name your vehicle?

My current truck is actually Big Blue the Third, but I digress.) My relationship with my truck is not unlike my relationship with a dear and constant friend. I expect it to always come through for me, and I worry beyond reason when it gets sick. Big Blue has been a pretty good truck.

<b>The Good</b>
 -<i> Power to spare.</i> I have the 5.3 litre 8 cylinder engine in this truck, and I fear no highway on-ramp. Passing is a breeze, and the only downside is that I sometimes find myself going 80 miles an hour. (At which point I immediately slow down. Honest, Officer, I really do.)

 - <i>Terrific visibility.</i> A half ton truck sits higher, so I can see around traffic. This truck also has the best headlights I�ve ever had on a vehicle. This may not sound like much, but I noticed the difference right away the first time I drove Big Blue at night.

 - <i>Day Time Running Lights.</i> Day time running lights have been required in Canada for years, and they really do help other drivers see you, especially on cloudy days.

 - <i>Pretty good gas mileage.</i> Depending on season, and how much weight I�m carrying, I get about 20 miles to the gallon on the highway, and 17 to 18 mpg around town. Not bad for an eight cylinder.

 - <i>Hauling capability.</i> Big Blue behaves very well under load, though obviously it takes longer to stop. Just a word of caution: don�t overload your truck - it can make the steering squirelly.

 - <i>Dual airbags.</i> There is both a driver and passenger side airbag. You can disable the passenger side airbag with your ignition key by means of a switch on the dash board. Many insurance companies will give you a discount for having airbags.

<b>The Not-So-Good</b>
<i>Seats.</i> Whoever designed the seat in this truck must be shaped differently than I am. You cannot get a true bench seat in this truck, which I find annoying. The 60/40 split seat has a two inch gap between the seat back and seat cushion in the middle section, which means the mail, the library book, and your Palm Pilot, all end up on the floor underneath the seat if you set them down next to you.

<i>So-so cupholders.</i> The best cupholder design I ever saw was on my 1994 GMC pick-up. These cupholders aren�t bad, but they are tough to close.

<b>Reliability</b>
Big Blue has never let me down. There has been one recall on this truck, for a potential problem with the clearance between the brake pipe and the body cross sill. The catalytic converter failed at 18,000 miles, and was replaced under warranty. (GM also called me with an apology.)

All in all this has been a good truck. I recommend this vehicle without hesitation.
