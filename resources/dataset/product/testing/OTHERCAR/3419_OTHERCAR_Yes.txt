            After driving an SL for 30 years Mercedes finally produced a 4 place vehicle that provides adequate room for the taller driver (me), and allows you to add two in the back for a short trip, and did not give me sticker shock after the purchase.  Aside from this it's a delight to drive,everything works great, and has all of the amenities that you would expect from a Mercedes. I love driving this vehicle around town. It handles great, has adequate power for a six cylinder vehicle, and I love how easy it is to lower and raise the convertible top. I'm even happier when I checked that I obtained about 25 miles to the gallon.  My 14 year old grand daughter has already claimed the vehicle when she turns 18 and is old enough to drive.
I would recommend this vehicle to those who love to drive a solid safe vehicle, but of course it can't be considered a family vehicle, but one that you're going to use more like a fun car. I would expect everyone would understand that a convertible would never be considered a family car, but a fun car.
I wish it had a larger gas tank, although what it has does not displease me. I wish it had a plusher interior, although what it has is more than adequate. <br><br>
