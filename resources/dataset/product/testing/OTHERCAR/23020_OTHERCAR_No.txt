            The Polaroid PhotoMax PDC-640 is an excellent camera for those just entering the world of digital photography.  This camera is packaged by Polaroid as a complete &quot;out of the box&quot; system.  For under $200, you get the camera, PC and TV cables, an AC adapter, Polaroid PhotoMax software, camera strap and pouch and even a set of Energizer batteries.

Strengths:

1.  Autofocus lens; not the typical fixed focus lens found on other cameras at this price level.
2.  Ability to use the LCD screen as a viewfinder to frame your subject.  
3.  Macro, close-up and normal focusing ranges.  I use only the macro and close-up ranges and have found both to be satisfactory.  When using the macro mode, the ability to focus with the LCD screen is a big plus. This is a feature not found on digital cameras costing hundreds of dollars more.
4.  Ease of use.  After installing the software, you will be taking and downloading photos in under 10 minutes.
5.  Price--where else are you going to find a complete outfit including AC adapter for under $200?

Weaknesses:

1.  Digital cameras are notorious for running down batteries and this camera is no exception.  Invest in a set of NIMH batteries and charger; you'll be glad you did.  
2.  Hard to use software.  I have tried to master this software and have switched to using Adobe Photoshop software that came with my scanner.
3.  Uneven flash illumination.  There is drop off at the edges in most of my photos.
4.  Framing with the optical viewfinder in the macro mode chops off part of your subject as the area within the lines in the viewfinder is not what is actually photographed.  The ability to focus with the LCD screen overcomes this, but this feature dramatically shortens battery life.
5.  If you take a photo without flash under artificial light, the color balance is off and will need to be adjusted using the software.  This is no easy task.  Always use the flash or natural light and you will have no problems.
6.  Only 640 x 480 resolution.  This will be adequate for most beginning users, but will not match the quality of the megapixel cameras.

I would recommend this camera to anyone just starting in digital photography.  For a low price, you get an easy to use camera that comes complete with an AC adapter.  Don't expect 35mm quality and you won't be disappointed.
