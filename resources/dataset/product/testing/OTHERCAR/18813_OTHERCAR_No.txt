            I bought this vehicle in June 99.  Well, it's really my boyfriend's car, but he lets me ride sometimes.  He was looking for an affordable basic sport utility, and when he found a base cherokee for a good price he snatched it up.  The car is a purple 98 Jeep Cherokee.  At the time I maily loved the color, although I managed to convince my macho man that it was blue.  Soon after purchase, however, it became apparent why the writers of car and driver had warned against buying anything lower than the 4.0 liter.  This car was not made for the highway.  It shakes and groans, it rattles, and the windows never close all the way, making for a lovely wind tunnel effect.  In the winter the windows freeze shut every morning, something that never happens with my volkswagon beetle.  All is not bad, however.  The jeep is excellent in the snow and off road.  It is much better than the previous sport utes we have owned, a Nissan Pathfinder and Isuzu Rodeo (never buy a rodeo!)  It isn't a bad car, just basic.  But the sport model and you will be happy as can be, as long as you don't desire the comfy car ride of the Laredo.<br><br>
