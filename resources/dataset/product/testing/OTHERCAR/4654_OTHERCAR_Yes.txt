            I bought in 1998 a Cavalier LS sedan 4 doors, with the 150 hp, full equip 1996.

I bought it because, for me it is a good car, for the use I make out of it ,I'm very often on highway, for long trip, I like the sound system that I have, with the original cd player from Gm. The air conditioning is good, it is working like a thermo-pump of your home. In winter it warm up my car faster than the heater.  I find the handling very nice, except when we are four adult on board, the space in the back is not big enough 2-3 inches more for the passenger will make it better. 

People who like the confort and the sport conduct will like the Cavalier Ls sedan  with the 2.4 liter twin over head cam with 150 hp. It is better than the standard one with the 2.2 liter.
The millage that I average is about 12 km per liter. On a full tank I made over 660 km on highway at a speed of 120 km per our.

So for me, this car is the best qualiy on the market, for price, for performance, handling, and confort for the owner.

What I find out also is that the break system for the front wheel get worn to fast. I put up about 40,000 km out of it. for me it should be able to go at least 60,000 km for the kind of driving I make. More highway than town driving. I drove in 1999 40,000 km.

All around, it is for the price the best  quality we can have .
