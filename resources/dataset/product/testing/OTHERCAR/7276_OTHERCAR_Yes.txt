            Before reading farther, please be advised that the following review is not a very technical one, stemming from the sad fact that the writer only recently mastered her microwave.  There are many experts contributing to this website that can offer very detailed, technical reviews and I feel it my moral duty to steer you in that direction if you prefer such a review.  

Rather, I offer a mere simple (minded?) view of a product that I have wanted for a long time, and finally, through careful planning and only slightly devious manipulation, finally acquired this past Christmas.

I am, sorry to say, an absolute disaster when it comes to taking pictures.  I never seem to get the lighting, angle, or anything at all about the shot right.  If I had to make a living as a photographer our whole family would surely starve.  Out of an entire roll of film, perhaps 2 pictures would turn out acceptable.  I got so sick of wasting time and money in my pathetic efforts to produce a decent photo that I finally decided a digital camera was the only way to snap-shot salvation.

In mid-August, I began to sow the seeds for a digital camera in my mother-in-law's head, hoping to reap the rewards of my efforts by December.  My mother-in-law never really asks what we want for Christmas, but I never let that daunt me in the slightest.  I always take the initiative and drop a few subtle hints.  I initially wanted a nice glass table patio set, but by Christmas there is a rotten selection and what is available is extremely over-priced.  So, I casually mentioned that the reason there have been so few pictures of the grandson is because it costs "so darned much money" for film and development of them.  I omitted the obvious:  it might not be so expensive if I had even a remote amount of skill with a camera.  I solicitously pointed out that everyone these days had digital cams and wistfully wished out loud that I could snap shots and email them to her.

Well, my slightly subtle hints not only resulted in a great camera for our family, but both of my husband's brothers got the same one!  My mother-in-law was sneaky and wrapped each one in a different box so nobody had any idea.  Needless to say my squeals of delight were hardly faux; I was THRILLED!

My�err�our. new camera turned  out to be an Olympus D-460 Zoom Digital.  It came with a tiny chip-like thingie resembling a micro floppy disk, rechargeable batteries, a charger, instruction manuals in several different languages, and a little black strap.  My father-in-law had even thought to include a little device called "SanDisk" which is a tiny drive that you stick the chip-like thingie into and download the pictures from your computer.  It plugs into the USB (I think those are the right letters!) port in back of your computer and includes the software to install it.  Oh yeah�if you don't have the SanDisk the camera also has the cables needed to download the pictures into your computer. 

So, after the usual amount of flying wrapping paper, groveling my thanks, and examining all the stuff in the box the camera came in, my father-in-law put some batteries into the camera and I was ready to snap pictures.  I was amazed at how easy the Olympus D-460 Zoom Digital was to use.

I now offer you my highly unsophisticated explanation of how pictures are taken.

1.	Read your manual from COVER TO COVER at least once.  This will familiarize you with all parts of the camera and teach you how to set the resolution.  The number of pictures you get and the resolution of them will depend on the size of your little floppy disk card thingie.  Generally speaking, the higher the resolution the fewer pictures you will be able to take.  

2.	If it's not already there, slide the little floppy into the slot on the end of the camera.  There is a notched end on one corner of the disk and even a little diagram to make sure you insert it correctly.

3.	Slide the camera cover to your right.  This turns it on and the lens will slowly slide out.  

4.	Flip up the flash cover.

5.	Look through the viewfinder until your picture is centered and depress the "shoot" button halfway.  A yellow light will appear next to a green one inside the camera viewfinder.  When the yellow light appears, press the button again and your picture is taken!

6.	When you have taken all the pictures you want, turn off the camera by closing the front cover.  You can now view and edit the shots by hitting a small button on the back of the unit, which will display you most recent shot on a small screen.  You can scroll forward and backwards, and even delete pictures you don't like.  You can only view the pictures when the camera has been turned off.

7.	You can now download your masterpieces into your PC to edit, print, or email.  

The Olympus D-460 Zoom Digital has many other great features for a mid-priced camera of it's kind, including a macro mode, date settings, and the ability to expand on the amount of pictures taken by purchasing a bigger floppy disk thingie. (Somebody PLEASE tell me the proper name for that thing!)

This is a GREAT all-around camera for a novice, and will most likely do whatever the more experienced photographer needs as well.  There are probably several additional features that this camera has but most likely I will never figure them out because I am far too busy simply having fun with it.  I could care less about the technical specifications as long as I can point, shoot, and produce a great result.

So���if you among the photographically impaired as I am and just want an easy-to-use and versatile digital camera, I highly recommend the Olympus D-460 Zoom Digital.   Good luck and Happy Picture Taking!
