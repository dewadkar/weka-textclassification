            After my previous nightmarish experiences with car dealers, I fell for the no bartering idea at Saturn. I won�t bore you with the details of my bad experience of the actual purchase of my 1998 SL2.  All dealers are the same! On 4/8/98, the day I was to drive my brand new car home, they had washed and detailed the car.  I found several paint flaws.  Of course the sales manager told me these problems could be buffed out and to bring the car back to them for repair. I did so on 4/21/98 and to my dismay the problems were still there.  This time they sent me to their �Saturn trained detailer�.  Another day out of my life and the problems still exist.  I gave up.  

5/28/98 I went back to the dealer because the weather strips had fallen off the driver�s side door and the front passenger�s door.  The dealer told me the factory had cut the weather strips too short and the dealers were repairing them only when customers complained of the problem. After they repaired the weather strips they had washed my car and presented it to me to take home.  I discovered they had left glue on my seats and on the outside of my car doors.  The glue was still there after they had washed the car! More time wasted while they cleaned the car.  

6/11/98 I returned to the dealer to have the license plate lamp assemblies replaced due to condensation on the inside.  When I returned home I discovered they had only replaced one.  My fault for not checking before I left the dealership, but I had trusted them to do as requested.  

6/26/99 my driver and front passenger electric windows started making clunking noises as they went up and down.  Returned to the dealer to have repaired.  They said they replaced the window regulators but before leaving I tested the windows.  They actually were not repaired.  I had to return on 6/28/99 to have a different technician try to repair the problems again, to no avail. He advised me there was a bulletin sent to them from the factory advising them of the problem and how to repair it.  These technicians were unable to do so.  At which time, they advised me the factory was to design new regulators and they would be able to replace mine at that time.  Which meant I would wasted another day at the dealership.

9/3/99 I returned to the dealership advising them of an exhaust leak noise I had been experiencing.  I told them some of my friends had even commented on the noise.  The technician told me he put the car up on the rack and checked all of the exhaust system and could not find any problems.  The noise continued to get louder and I took the car to Midas who showed my husband exactly where the exhaust leak was.  I returned to Saturn with the Midas paperwork and they replaced the intermediate exhaust pipe, no questions asked.

3/29/00 I took the car in for an oil change and advised them of a loose belt noise coming from the engine compartment, repair the squeaky brake noise and the window noise again. The engine noise turned out to be a pulley assembly problem and they replaced the serpentine belt idler.  They also removed both rear brake drums and cleaned and lubricated back plate and no more brake noise at this time.  As far as the window noise, they again could not repair it.  The technician told me that is the way electric windows sound!  The windows make a labored grinding noise and clunk clunk and he says that is the way it is supposed to sound!  No wonder they can�t fix the problem, they think that what it is supposed to do! While I was waiting for my car, I sat in some used Saturns on the lot and listened to the electric windows. They too made the noise, even worse. Oh, what I have to look forward to!

I would have to say the only good thing that has happened to me is when I had a flat tire and Firestone replaced the tire as road hazard damage.

So far, the car drives smooth and, knock on wood, the problems I have had are cosmetic.  But the time I have wasted at the dealership is not what I understood my experience with Saturn was going to be.

Due to my experiences with this 1998 SL2 and this dealership, I will not buy another Saturn, nor have I recommended one to my friends and family.  When someone stops me and asks how I like my Saturn, I tell them the truth.  Beware!
