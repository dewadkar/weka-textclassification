            In the summer of 1998, it was decided that my mother's 1986 Accord would go to my sister, and since I was to inherit my mother's next car after two years, she decided to get a used car.  While on her work break one day, she was strolling through the she streets of our small village and came across a white 1991 Prelude.  My aunt has owned a red 1988 Prelude 2.0 Si since it was new and has loved it for all 340,000 or so miles.  My aunt taught me to drive a five-speed with that car.  So, my mother who can't drive a manual, brought me along for the test drive of the white car, although I was only 14.  I drove it, loved it, and had my mother buy it.  I am very pleased with her choice.
The first things that I loved about the car were it's low roof, low windshield, low seating position, and the seats themselves.  The seats are comfortable, but are very, very firm with great support.  The whole car is extremely low to the ground which I love, because it makes the car feel safe and sporty.
But the car's best feature is it's handling.  Despite the modest stock tires, the car will NEVER let go in turns.  My father's '97 Maxima SE, my mother's ex '86 Accord, my friend's '91 Integra, and my sister's current car, a '90 Accord EX, do not handle as well.  I've driven all of those cars and their handling can't compare.  The Prelude's steering is excellent, too.  It's light, accurate and responsive, and it returns to center position very easily.  The only thing that a manual system has that it doesn't is heavyness in the parking lot- it feels that good.  The brakes are firm, too.  They modulate well and feel confident.  If the car had the optional ABS, the car would brake and handle flawlessly, the 4WS option would make the car even more of a blast to drive, but it can't be had with ABS.  The engine is smooth and powerful.  While it makes most of its power at higher RPMs, it still has great low speed driveability.  At the same time, an AWD turbo Celica or Eclipse of the same era would blow it away at a stoplight.  Still, the Prelude can still out-accelerate any non-turbo version of either of those cars.  
If there is a weak link in the Prelude's driving dynamics, it would have to be the transmission.  While it shifts accurately, the gear shift is too stiff.  The clutch feels nice when pressed, but during engagement, it 's grabby.  
The rest of the car is wonderful, I can't think of a better used car deal.  It's had ZERO visits to the shop and still feels new(granted, it only has 70,000 miles on it.)  The paint is glossy despite nine ungaraged years, and this car doesn't suffer from the early rusting problem which afflicts other Hondas, particularly Accords.  The interior is made up of all high quality materials, especially the upholstery.  The doors are heavy and feel as though they are going to fall off each time a door is opened, but the car still feels light and tossable, while still feeling rigid.  The interior has a lot of room for front seat passengers, a large trunk, and while the back seats are small, they are still bigger than those of, say an Eclipse or Celica.
I heartily recommend purchasing a Prelude for any person seeking a sporty, reliable, practical good deal, and I look forward spending many years with my car.<br><br>
