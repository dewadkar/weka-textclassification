            I've been wanting a digital camera for a long time, but I couldn't really justify buying one. However, a friend of mine bought the Sony Cybershot 50, and the more I played with it, the more I knew that I wanted a digital camera for myself. Also, my regular camera (a Canon Elph Z80 or whatever it's called) was stolen from my car, so I didn't own a camera at all anymore.

I bought the Digital Elph because I absolutely loved my regular Elph and all the advantages of having a camera so small (as big as a pack of cigarettes) that you can literally take it with you everywhere you go. I wanted a 3 megapixel camera, but figured that 2 megapixels was high enough resolution, considering the tradeoff in size for the 3 megapixel cameras.

What I love about this camera:

1. Size. It goes everywhere with me, and I've already snapped some cool photos that I wouldn't have been able to otherwise.

2. It's digital. Now I'll take photos of things that I wouldn't have considered &quot;important enough&quot; to shoot with an expensive regular camera. Once I get home (or while I use the camera), I just delete the stupid photos or the ones that didn't turn out.

3. You can turn off the LCD screen to save batteries. Whenever I'm outside, I just use the viewfinder and don't turn on the screen at all. You get much longer battery life that way, and the experience is just like using a regular camera.

4. The panoramic stitching feature. It has this feature where you can line up the camera and take a huge panoramic photo. When you get home, you use the Canon software to stitch it together into one huge, long JPEG file that you can send to other people. The software does a great job of lining everything up for you.

5. USB. Easy to hook up to a new Mac or PC. Enough said.

6. Rechargeable battery. Some of the other Canon cameras don't come with a rechargeable battery, believe it or not! But this model does. Replacement (or spare) batteries are $35, I think. They take a couple of hours to charge when they're depleted, which is plenty fast for me.

7. Great photos. It's already taken some really good photos, and I'm very happy with the camera's picture taking ability. Just point, shoot, and you'll probably get a good shot.

8. Black and White mode. You can switch it over to a simulated b/w mode, which is a neat feature.

9. 2X optical zoom and 3X digital zoom. Optical zoom is best, because it doesn't pixelate the photo. A digital zoom is just the same thing as what you can do with the cropping and zooming software when you get home on your computer. 

10. Uses standard CF cards, so you can buy other brands of extra memory for the camera. I bought a 48 meg card, which holds 71 small high res photos, or 32 large high res photos. It comes with an 8 meg card, which is small.

11. Comes with a USB cable to hook it up to your PC or Mac.

12. Also comes with a USB/S-video cable so you can hook the camera up to any modern television set and see your photos on the huge TV screen! This feature is terrific for visiting non-computer people, or for just doing a quick slide show of the day's photos.

What I don't like.

1. Interface is a bit harder to learn that the Sony camera that I tried out. But hey, I still figured it out pretty quickly.

2. Battery life could be better.

3. Wish it had 3 megapixels and came with a larger memory card, but that's just hopeless dreaming and not an actual criticism of the real camera.

Other features.

You can upload your photos online to sites like ofoto.com, shutterfly.com, zing.com and photoaccess.com. They will all print out your best photos on real photographic paper instead of on cheap paper from your regular printer. (Photographic paper has an archival life of more than 100 years, versus just a few years with regular paper.)

Right now, of those sites I listed, I like ofoto.com the best, and shutterfly.com the second best. Ofoto.com is great because you can store all of your photos and create online photo albums that you can let other people see from the web. That's free! (Zing and Shutterfly do that too.)

It's great to back up all your favorite photos on the web, so you don't lose them if your computer crashes. I still haven't ordered any prints yet to see how they look on photographic paper.

Summary.

I really like this camera and am very happy that I purchased it. <br><br>
