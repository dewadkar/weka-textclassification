            I was looking to buy a digital camera for my husband's Christmas present and a friend's son (who's in the TV Camera business) recommended the Minolta Dimage F100 to me. He said that the price had recently come down considerably and for the money -- the size of the camera, its weight (6.5 oz), the amount of megapixels (4), it was a great deal. I did some research on it and found the Dimage online and purchased it. We have not been disappointed at all. 

We took the camera with us to St. Lucia and the photos came out unbelievable. The colors of the native flowers, the Caribbean, birds and volcano were vivid and sharp. There are settings for taking up-close photographs, portraits, sports action, landscapes, sunsets and night portraits. There is also a special setting for taking black & white photos which is separate from the automatic setting that the camera is normally left on.

The best part is viewing your photographs right on the TV set (you can plug a cable from the camera to the TV) and then deciding which ones to keep or delete. You can also do this right through the LCD monitor screen on the camera.

The camera uses Secure Digital memory cards which is great. You can buy them with lots of memory (it comes with a 16 MB card) and the last one I used was able to store around 200 photos of top-grade quality on it. Developing the photos is easy too. Many drug stores like Eckerds and CVS now have digital photo developing machines and charge around 29 cents per 4x6 photo.

Anyone that purchases this camera will not be disappointed. Your beautiful photographs will speak for themselves.
