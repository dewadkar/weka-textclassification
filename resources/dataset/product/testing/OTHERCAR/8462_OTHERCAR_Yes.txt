            I love this camera.  I carry it with me wherever I go.  I read the smart card directly into my computer with a reader and can transfer 100 pictures in less than a minute.  It is also possible to transfer with the USB port; however, I really like just plugging the card into my computer.

The sound capture setting where a 4 second audio file is linked to each shot has been lots of fun.  The sound is recorded right after the snapshot, so there are usually some interesting comments (e.g.  &quot;I blinked&quot; or &quot;Gawd, I'll look awful in that one&quot;, etc.).

The software that comes with the camera is great for organizing and for viewing slide shows.  I just returned from vacation in Maine and downloaded the 170 photos into a file named &quot;Maine&quot; and have been amazed with the quality and viewing enjoyment.  

A picture taken in high quality format can be blown up to amazing detail on the computer.  I took a picture of people waiting in line and it is possible to zoom in and tell the time from people's wrist watches...it is really amazing!  I can spend 20 minutes on one picture looking at background details.

The best thing about this camera is it is so small and is still packed with every feature imaginable with the highest quality possible.<br><br>
