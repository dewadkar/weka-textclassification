            We purchased our 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited six months ago.   My wife and I were just browsing the showroom on a whim (she was convinced that she wanted a Subaru Legacy Outback 30th Limited Edition), when the salesman mentioned a trade-in that arrived that same day...a Char-gold '98 with 13,000 miles on it.  I convinced her to drive it just as a reference...to have something to compare to in the same price range.  We bought it within the hour.  It  is fully loaded with the V8--a great value for the money.  It is well-designed with personalized features (radio controls on the steering wheel, keyless remote that remembers how you like the seat).  And it performs incredibly.  I had the rock shields added to the undercarriage so that I could take it out without worry.  I've used it to pull a camper, my fishing boat and took it off-road during a recent hunting trip in Canada.   My wife loves it for the capacity:  she can carry 3 kids,a double stroller, groceries and still have room for yardsale deals.   We actually have to schedule who gets the Jeep--me or my wife!  <br><br>
