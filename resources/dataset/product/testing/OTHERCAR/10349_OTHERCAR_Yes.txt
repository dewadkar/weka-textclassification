                 We have owned a 1994 Toyota Corolla special from the day it was new, and we are now test driving the newer versions of the same car. We have not decided what we will do.

      It is difficult to part with a car that is as responsive to the gas pedal and easy on gas as this faithful car has done for us. She has taken on a personality, she is comfortable to drive and makes us feel wanted to sit in her plain but comfortable seats.

     I use to complain about the prices of the service maintenance checks, but after seven years our old car drives, handles and is just as quiet as the new cars we have test driven. 

     That is our problem, we want a new car the 2001 Corolla is the car of choice, In Canada the Price is $16,614 ( under $10,000 USD ), but we feel that we are betraying the faithfulness of the little car we have grown to love.

      If we had any problems with her we would have had no trouble getting rid of her. I have driven her through desert, mountain and seacoast conditions she loves them all.

I have started her in minus 40 weather and in summer heat, it makes no difference to her. I don't get into arguments with her, not like some people I have spent as much time with. 
   So it is decided , We will get our new 2001 Toyota Corolla, but 1994 stays as a second car ( don't tell her that please - she knows she is first ).
