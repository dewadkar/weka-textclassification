            If you are even thinking about buying a Golf, go test drive something else first. My fiance's 1998 Golf is the WORST car either of us have ever owned. She wanted a Volkswagon for a long time and finally got one. Now it's the biggest mistake we made. At just under 35,000 miles here is the list of things that have had to be replaced so far:

1.) All 4 tires have been replaced and 1 of the replacements failed as  
    well. Our dealer says that there is nothing abnormal about this 
    though and says &quot;that they (Volkswagon) doesn't manufacture tires&quot; 
    and to take it up with Goodyear (Goodyear Eagle GS tires came on the 
    car new). Goodyear says that the tires were driven on with no air in 
    them. They are half right, when a tire suddenly starts loosing air 
    while I'm driving on the highway means I have to drive a bit on them. 
    One thing to note is that the tire shop I go to could find no damage 
    from road debris in the tires, but did find an area where the tire 
    was leaking air.
2.) The driver's side seat frame broke at just over 24,000 miles and 
    needed to be replaced. The seat is now bending just like the last one 
    and will most likely need to be replaced soon.
3.) The reverse gear broke 3 weeks ago at about 32,500 miles resulting in 
    the transmission needing to be replaced. (The car is a 5 speed manual 
    shift.)

In addition to those things we have had a horrible time getting the car serviced (JiffyLube, a local quick oil change shop here in town doesn't even carry the oil filters for it!.) The car is LOUD... not a little loud but like driving a tank at 60mph. Volkswagon acknowledges this problem but can offer no solutions to it. They also have a memo out to dealers/service centers that states that the cars ARE indeed noisy and that the brakes squeal. Squeal isn't the word I would have used though... it's more like a constant, ear piercing screech every time the brake pedal is depressed even a little. Also, for a 4 cylinder, the car eats up gas like it's going out of style. I had a V6 3.0 Liter Chevy Lumina that used less gas a week than this car driving the same distance.

Not more than 2 months after purchasing the car we were extremely unhappy with it and continue to feel the pinch every time this poorly designed auto has something else go wrong with it. Our checkbook shelled out about $400 for this last repair on the transmission for things not covered under warranty.

Numerous calls to Volkswagon's customer service phone number have only lead to more frustration. The car, while needing multiple repairs, can not be classified as a lemon because nothing has broken more than once (YET!!!). The dealer we bought the car from refuses to deal with us anymore. The problems we have had with the dealer alone filled a 6 page typed document that Volkswagon has yet to respond to. The letter was sent 5 months ago.

Again, if you are thinking of purchasing a Golf, please do yourself a favor, and go down the street to that other dealer and test drive something else. If you insist on test driving one of these cars at least ask to see the memos from the Manufacturer regarding the problems that are ACKNOWLEDGED by Volkswagon. Perhaps you can get a better deal with that info.

**UPDATE**
Well folks, yet another thing has gone wrong in the life of our Golf. On the 3rd of June our Alarm and door locks started to activate and deactivate themselves for absolutely no reason. A quick call to the dealership (not the one we bought the car from mind you, they still want nothing to do with us) resulted in a &quot;Well that's odd.&quot; response. They didn't offer any suggestions to fix it or things we could try. Now mind you that the alarm honks the horn when you lock the car, so about every 40 or 50 seconds the thing would beep. If you locked the car it would unlock, then lock, then unlock, and on and on. After about an hour of the thing not stopping I disconnected the battery so we wouldn't need a jump start the next day (the neighbors were not to happy about it either). The service rep we had on the phone, when asked if we could get the car in to the shop, said &quot;they had no openings until the middle of the following week.&quot; Also, my fiance' and I both live in Plymouth, Ma and work in Boston. We can't bring the car into the dealership durring normal service hours because we have to work. So, long story short, the car is still honking away and we need to disconnect the battery every time we park it. 

Also, in regards to hearing from Volkswagon of America (after almost 9 months now) is that the service manager at the original dealership has left and his replacement now needs to research the problems we had. Volkswagon of America was supposed to put us in touch with the regional sales manager, but that too still hasn't happened. They always have an excuse why the meeting couldn't take place or has to be postponed. We come to the conclusion that Volkswagon, as a manufacturer, could care less about making crappy cars so long as we pay for them. Think about this, a car is the only thing you can buy that you can't return for a replacement if it breaks. As much as I hate the government getting involved in something else in our day to day lives I think the legislators should create tougher laws to protect car buyers from junky car manufacturers and dealers.

I used to say that you should test drive something else first, but no I say don't bother with the Golf or any other Volkswagon or Audi product (Audi actually is the parent company for Volkswagon now)at all. Go buy an American car or at least something not German Engineered.

Good Luck!
