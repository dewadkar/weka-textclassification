            I purchased this camera in November of '99. For the first three weeks this was the easiest digital camera I had ever used. My past experience was with the Samsung SSC 410 N and I was ready for a megapixel camera on the inexpensive side. Also, I was taken by the neat blue body.
At first, the camera would just shut itself off. A quick trip of the shutter door would usually restore power and I would just continue shooting.
It got to the point where I could not get the camera to power up at all. That is when I contacted Agfa customer service. After sitting on the phone for 30 minutes, the Agfa rep explained that since I had owned the camera less than a month, they would just send me a new one and I could send them the old one in the box that the new one came in. Seemed like a plan to me.
Then they lost all of the information that I had faxed them. So I refaxed it again. They lost that one also. 
I have since sold that camera and purchased an HP C200. My problem is not with the Agfa camera. Anyone can make a faulty product. How you resolve warranty issues tells me a lot about the company itself. I find that I do not trust Agfa to honor their warranty.<br><br>
