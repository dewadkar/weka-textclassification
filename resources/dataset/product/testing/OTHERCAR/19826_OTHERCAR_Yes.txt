            I have infrequently been driving the Toyota Landcruiser since my mom bought the thing a few years ago.  And I have learned to hate this car.  It's a beast!  From the outside, you may think, that's a phat-ass looking car, and on the inside (leather seats, room for seven) it feels and looks great.  But try driving this bad boy.  It's almost impossible to manuever around turns unless you slow to under 10 mph.  And stopping is impossible too.  The one advantage is you will never be hurt in an accident, but you're more likely to get into one.  The truck gets horrible gas mileage , 10 miles per gallon, and costs a good $30 to fill up the tank.  And it costs $50,000 new!  <br><br>
