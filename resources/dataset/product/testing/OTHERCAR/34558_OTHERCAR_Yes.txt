            The Infiniti QX4 is the best looking SUV on the market today. The exterior paint job is beautiful enough to turn all heads and the interior is luxurious. The standard leather seats are supple and gorgeous! According to the salesman, the seats were designed by a chiropractor and after a long trip the results proved the salesman to be right! The back seat is comfortable for two adults but there could be more head-room overall.  I don't think it would be comfortable for someone over six feet.  But then, I'm not six feet!  While it has as much power as any of the SUV's I test-drove, I would like to have more punch especially when passing semi's but, if that's my worst complaint, I'm not suffering too much.  Am I?  

One thing I absolutely love is the way the headlights are positioned.  They illuminate road signs at a distance without blinding oncoming traffic.  How they engineered this I have no idea but it is an outstanding feature when driving at night.  The cab is very tight and because of this there is no wind noise. The automatic 4-wheel drive feature senses slippage and puts in the appropriate amount of 4-wheel drive.  I could go on all day.  It's a delight to drive and drives more like a car than a utility vehicle.

My family recently took a 12 hour trip and, to our delight, were not in the least exhausted when we finished out trip.  Any other such intensive driving would have done us in.  Probably the most fun is watching all the heads turn as you drive down the road!<br><br>
