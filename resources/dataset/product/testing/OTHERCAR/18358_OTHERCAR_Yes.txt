            We loved our '97 Villager and decided to get a '99 Villager Estate because of the second passenger door. The vehicle is a pure delight to drive--it feels like a car. We love the ability to fit our children and grandchildren in one vehicle for family excursions. The entertainment console with video cassette player makes travelling with children a real pleasure, especially since they can watch the video and listen through headphones while adults can listen to the radio or CDs. Since my husband and I are both in our 50's the seating of a van is much more comfortable than a car for longer road trips.

The downside is parts availability. We were in an accident in October and the tailgate had to be replaced. The factory part was backordered for 7 weeks! Two weeks after getting the minivan back we ran into a problem with the driver's door lock. We have remote keyless entry and the drivers door would not lock--even manually. We took it to the dealer on December 10 and were told there were two parts needed: an actuator and something else. The dealer did not have the parts so they would have to order them and they should be in within a week. On December 16 my husband called to see if the parts were in and was told they were backordered and might be in by the middle of the week. Our dealer was extremely apologetic and said he even called around to other dealers in the area to see if anyone had the needed parts. As I write this on the evening of December 21, the parts are still not in!<br><br>
