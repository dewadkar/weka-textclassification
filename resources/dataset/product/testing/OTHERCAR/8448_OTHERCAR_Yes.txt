            Most reviews of this camera seem to be looking at it from the perspective ofthe accomplished photographer who is looking for another tool. I'm reviewing the Olympus C-3030 Zoom camera from the other angle; the not very accomplished amateur learning to stretch her skills.

My experience with digital photography until this point had been very limited; a roughly 10 year old camera that was the equivalent of a point and shoot. Once the original novelty of being able to see the picture I just took and upload it easily into the computer wore off, the rather crude picture quality started to grate. And since it was technically my husband's camera, it was time to upgrade to a camera of my own.

The Olympus was a gift, so I can't really review the selection process in its entirety. Two very important aspects of the selection were physical ergonomics and picture quality. The physical ergonomics are of paramount importance because I have serious wrist problems that affect my ability to grip objects, and many cameras are in packages that are uncomfortable or awkward to hold. The Olympus has a thick right side that fits nearly perfectly in my hand, so it very comfortable to hold for long periods of time.

Furthermore, the Olympus has both a traditional viewfinder and a screen, which can be turned off to save power. I prefer to use the screen when I can, but the traditional viewfinder is very handy when bright light makes the screen hard to see.

The quality of the pictures is, in a word, superb. At 3.3 megapixels the detail is sometimes breathtaking, but even at a lower resolution, the results are more than acceptable for the web.

Yes, it does come with a manual that is the size of some communities' phone books. The manual isn't a novel, that must be read front to back and memorized, but works well as a reference, where you can learn the features of the camera as you need them. With the camera pretty much in its "straight out of the box" configuration, I went to take a picture of our wire-framed Christmas light display. The flash went off, and I got a fantastic, in focus, well-lit picture - of the wire frames. I quickly determined that I needed to turn off the flash, found that section of the manual, made the necessary adjustments, and took another picture, all in under five minutes. The second picture was even better - the colors of all the lights appeared brilliantly.

Currently, I am experimenting with taking detailed, close pictures of some custom figurines I create. While I have yet to determine the perfect combination of light, exposure, zoom, etc., I am grateful for the many controls that were once very intimidating, and the results are steadily improving as my skills do.

This is one of the things I like best about this camera; I hit the ground running with it, but there are enough aspects to it to allow my own growth and skills. I freely admit I am not taking advantage of anywhere near all of its abilities at this point, but I also know that someday soon I will.

I use a Mac as my main computer, so I'm automatically suspicious of any software that says it will work on both PCs and Macs, since Macs almost always get a poor port or buggy software. I was very pleased with the Cammedia software that came with the Olympus; installation was a breeze. The Cammedia software itself is intuitive if you've ever used another graphics processing program, and picture download from the camera is reasonably swift.

The Olympus also comes with a copy of Adobe Photoshop LE, which I did not install, since I have other graphics software I prefer to use.

My biggest issue with this camera is the lens cap; at this level, it should have come with a tether. I quickly bought one and installed it, since I knew that between my own propensity for dropping things and the cats' propensity for playing with small plastic objects the cap had a very high likelihood of being lost.

While I would not recommend this camera as a first camera to a rank beginner, I don't think you need to be a highly qualified professional to use this camera. It's very usable right out of the box, and you can experiment with the settings at your own pace. I'm very pleased with the results, and look forward to even better results as the camera and I move forward together.
