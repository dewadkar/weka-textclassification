            We bought a new 2001 Honda Civic and have been mostly happy with it.  Initially there were several recalls that had to be taken care of before I was willing to say that.  Of course, since we got the car early in the model year, we were some of the first people to complain, so it took awhile for enough people to complain for us to get the problem fixed.  Honda costumer service is NOT wonderful.  We had to make several trips for each item.  The recalled items were the radio, a power window mechanism and the fuel tank gauge.  (The fuel tank problem was VERY hard to get Honda to fix -- they knew there was a problem early, but were unwilling to fix it since it was labor intensive.)

However, the car is great in a crash.  We have been rear-ended twice (was as the middle car in a wreck sandwich).  Each time the passengers were not seriously hurt eventhough the car suffered extensive damage (you should have seen how the compact car that hit us in the 10 mph crash crumpled).  
If you notice excessive vibration after a crash (or even some very hard driving) you might want Honda to look at your engine mounts (especially the ones behind the engine).  It took 3 mechanics to fix this problem -- covered by the crash, but the Honda mechanic implied it was a known design flaw & Honda would fix it for free (but, not recall).

Gas mileage has been wonderful.  My husband uses it as his commuter car.  HUGE trunk.  Passengers in the rear seats have plenty of room, too.

The only big flaw seems to be a very large blind spot.  When I merge, I have to really sit up & look out the windows and use the mirrors.  I know someone who turned in their Civic after a week since their wife couldn't stand the blind spot.  

I probably wouldn't buy a new Honda due to the bad problems with customer service, but I might consider getting a used car and dealing with my own mechanic.  The Civic has been a serviceable car.
