            My wife and I wanted an SUV for quite some time now, and have visited every dealership we could think of.  We were on the verge of leasing the 2000 Ford Expedition, but it was just too large and costly.  Before we made the final plunge into Ford, we visited a couple more dealerships, including Jeep.  As we sunk into the Cherokee Loredo, we instantly knew...this was it!

We leased the 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Loredo, 4.0 L, V6, 2WD model for approximately $310/month and $3500 down...pretty good deal on a sticker price of $33,000.  Our model is truly fully loaded, with leather seats, sunroof, upgraded Infinity Gold speaker system, 10 disc CD changer, radio controls on steering wheel, and allow wheels.

The car is a great ride as well, very smooth.  Since we didn't get the 4WD version, we gave up a little more power as well, but works quite well with 190 HP.  Overall, this is a beautiful car (black paint, tinted windows and charcoal leather)...and definitely gets stares.

I suggest going for the 2WD version, unless you are serious about off-roading, since you would be paying an extra $3000 or so.<br><br>
