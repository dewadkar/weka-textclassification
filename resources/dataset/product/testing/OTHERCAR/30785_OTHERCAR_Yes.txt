            I received the Olympus D-340R Digital camera for Christmas 1999. As I am a 51 year-old granny who takes pictures of her only grandchild,constantly, my husband decided he was tired of going to CVS every week to look for lost film. This camera came highly recommended by friends and salespeople and was offered at a special price through BJs Wholesale. It took about a week or two until I finally understood how to best utilize this camera's many features, but once I did, no one was safe.
My granddaughter literally hides her face when I approach! At last, pictures of superior quality whenever and wherever I choose.

What a joy to see instantly what you've shot and what adjustments you need to make before you frame your next shot. The software enclosed was Adobe Photo Shop, my favorite editing software. This camera does it all and even has a stitching feature that allows you to take panoramic shots.

Since we now actually get to see the pictures that I've taken as opposed to wondering what year that roll of film on the dresser is, everyone benefits. Needless to say, I email pictures all of the time. Its just so much more fun.

I don't know if this camera is still being made for certainly technology has advanced since last year, but even if you have to go to the auctions to find it, buy it, buy it, buy it. Great camera, reasonably priced designed for ease of use (even for little old grannies!).
