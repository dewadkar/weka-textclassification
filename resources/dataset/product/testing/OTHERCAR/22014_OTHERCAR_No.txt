            We bought a brand new 1997 Dodge Caravan in February 1997. We had it about one month when I was driving down the freeway and the speedometer quit working, which caused the transmission to kick into low gear, so here I am in 60 MPH traffic and my van is going nowhere, even with the gas pedal all the way down to the floor. The dealer fixed that. 

Next the serpentine belt frayed and I was sitting on the side of the road for 2 hours until my husband got off work and picked me up. I got the Dodge roadside assistance for 
$50 a year and we have had it towed at no charge 4 or 5 times because of the serpentine belt fraying. It always frayed on the left side. This belt has been repaired 5 times. They put a wider Chrysler tensioning arm for the serpentine belt and it frayed again. We paid $ 400 (it was no longer under warranty) and then it broke again. We finally filed a complaint with the Dodge Headquarters and were not charged anything the last 2 times it broke. The last time it happened in December 2000, we told the dealer we were going on vacation and left it at the dealer for 2 weeks. We think it is fixed now but since it seems to happen twice a year, we are not positive, but we sure hope so.   

The windshield wipers come on all by themselves, either when you turn the engine on, when you use the signals without turning the wipers on and sometimes when you are driving with both hands on the steering wheel. 

The drivers side sliding door got jammed when I closed it one night. I had to close it kind of hard to get it shut all the way because I was on a slight hill. We had that fixed at a body shop because the dealer was going to charge a minimum of $800 and we got it fixed for $200 at a body shop. 

It is in the shop now because the A.C. is not working. 

When my husband picked me up at the dealer, they wanted to show him a new Caravan and he said , " No thanks, we will never buy another Dodge or Chrysler product."
