               After recently getting married it was time to add a second car to my garage. I work at a car dealership, and to my delight found a gem in the lot. A black 1997 Toyota Rav4 gleamed at me from the lot. I was drawn to it immediatley by its sporty look. Having been a loyal Toyota driver for years, I snatched it right up.
   While driving it home I first noticed the comfortable feel of it. It didn't feel as rough handling as a truck. Although it wasn't as smooth as a sedan. I was pleased at the "middle of the road" sort of feel. Nice crossover.
   Naturally I stopped for my cup of coffee to unwind. Much to my dismay, the cupholder was almost behind my seat. Small price to pay for the overall package, however.
   Next I turned on the radio. YUCK. None of my Toyotas have had good stereo sound. So, I suggest an upgrade for the serious audio enthusiast. But, it should suffice for the average listener.
   I have had it for a week, and haven't had to put gas in it yet. I think that speaks for itself.
   I got home, and took my wife for a ride. She loved it! It has style, comfort, reliability, and a high fun factor for driving. This one will last a LONG time. 
   If a reasonably priced, reliable 4WD vehicle is what you need, do yourself a favor and grab one of these puppies on sight!!! Oh what a feeling!
