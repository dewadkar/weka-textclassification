            Ah, how the mighty have fallen.
The first generation Mazda RX-7 was perhaps the finest affordable Japanese sports car ever built.Built to compete with the likes of the Datsun 240 and the Porsche 914, this uniquely-styled two-seater beat both of them hands-down on track and in the shop.
You can get a used 81 RX-7 for as little as $1,000.
These cars were rated &quot;Excellent&quot; by the leading consumer's digests for reliability.
With a 100-horsepower Wankel engine, the car red-lines at 7,000 RPM and accelerates like a bat out of hell.
The only drawback: The clutch will wear prematurely -- especially if you drive it like the sports car it is.<br><br>
