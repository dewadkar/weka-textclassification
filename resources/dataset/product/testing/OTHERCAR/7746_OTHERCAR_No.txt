                When I got my 97 neon, I was pretty excited. After all, it was my first car and I had always thought neons were cute. I was looking for something that would get good gas mileage and the size seemed perfect. However, when it rained one day shortly after my purchase, my happiness turned into disappointment. The back floor pan was soaked with water. There was at least three inches of water above the carpet. And the moldy smell was just horrid. I promptly returned to the dealer and they agreed to fix the problem and they did, but my disappointment didn't stop there. A couple of months down the road, my windows began to make a whistling noise. The sound was so bad that I would have to roll down my window to make it stop because it hurt my ears. I again returned to the dealer and they again agreed to fix the problem. They fixed it somewhat but it does occasionally still whistle. Not only do my windows make noise, but there is constantly a rattling noise coming from under my hood. Sometimes it gets so loud that I must turn up my radio just to drown it out. I took my car in and they told me they couldn't find anything wrong with it. 
     My brakes are always screeching, especially after it rains. I have went to the mechanics to have them checked it out but I was told that there was nothing wrong with them. Sometimes when I start my car up, it makes a really loud banging noise..so loud that one day my mom ran outside to make sure I was ok. 
     This car is anything but a pleasure to drive. The only thing I like about it is the fact that it gets pretty good gas mileage. <br><br>
