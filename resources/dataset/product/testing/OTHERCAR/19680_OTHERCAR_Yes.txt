            This car is plain wonderful in comparison to the used Chryslers I used to drive before I got a job.  The air conditioning works very fast, the gas mileage is as good as I could get in an automatic (when I bought it in 1999, the Toyota Echo has better mileage for the class now).   The car has a very smooth ride and doesn't give me a back ache.  I ran into another car (unfortunately my fault) and the car's hood was ruined- however after getting it fixed it works like new- the engine itself suffered no damage.  In any case, I survived quite nicely.

The dealerships are sometimes a bit weak.  I bought the expensive maintenance plan- which I regret because it is so hard to get my car in for routine maintenance- the hours are short and they are always too busy and the wait is often pretty long.  Next time I'll get a service plan from a place with better evening and weekend hours.

The financing was tricky, too. The dealer didn't mention the lowest auto loan rate that they had advertised on the web until prompted.

I used the website a lot in picking out my car.  Saturn's website is well done but not as fancy as the competition's.

I think the only other car that competes with this car is the Toyota Echo.
