            My 1994 Cadillac Deville was rear-ended by a woman in a 2000 Buick Century two Thursdays ago. I rented a 2001 Mercury Sable GS from Enterprise while my Caddy was being repaired . This is my experience.

The car I rented is finished in Silver Frost Clearcoat Metallic with a Medium Graphite (light gray) cloth interior.

It was powered by a SEFI 3.0L 155 hp V6 giving 185 ft/lbs. torque @ 3950 RPM mated to a 4 speed automatic with overdrive. It was shod with Firestone Affinity 215/60R16 blackwall tires mounted on steel rims capped by well-executed wheel covers that I had at first mistaken for alloy wheels. Walking around this car, exterior fit and finish was very good. There were no visible blemishes or uneven panel gaps. The Sable's styling is very attractive - far nicer than that of its recent predecessors. 

The 155hp 3.0 V-6 seemed rather weak for this car. I would personally select the 200 hp version for more get-up and go. It seemed I had to depress the accelerator pedal further to propel the car forward. The engine didn't run rough, but it also didn't run very smoothly. At times I thought the transmission was slipping. This car only had 11,000 miles on the odometer. I don't know if they were hard miles as the car was a rental, but I've had cars with far more tough urban miles that ran smoother. However, the car handled well in turns and braking distances were fairly short.

The first thing I noticed when I sat in this car is the firmness of the seats. I'm 6'0" tall and the fit is rather snug, even with the manually operated driver's seat all the way back. I'm used to the softer leather seats of my Cadillac. I haven't driven the Sable on any extended trips, so I can't really describe any advantage or disadvantage of these firmer seats, though lumbar support seemed good.   

I also noticed that the Sable's rather conservative instrument panel forsakes the "oval theme" of its Ford Taurus sister.There is a small amount of imitation timber framing the radio and HVAC controls, but it looks rather fake. Have auto makers forgotten how to make convincing imitation wood? I had a 1989 Mercury Grand Marquis and its fake wood looked surprisingly like the real thing. The Sable's four- spoke steering wheel has a thick hub housing the driver's air bag and is capped with an aluminum medallion emblazoned with the Mercury "M" - a nice touch. Tilt wheel is standard and the GS is shifted via a stubby column-mounted lever.

The instrument panel has four round gauges - fuel gauge, speedometer, temperature gauge and a tachometer in addition to a plethora of "idiot lights." I find the tachometer rather silly in a vehicle equipped with an automatic. An ammeter and oil pressure gauge would've been far more practical. Still, it is kind of entertaining to watch the tach needle move when you rev the engine but I doubt anybody would be in danger of redlining the Sable. 

The Sable GS comes standard with AM/FM stereo with cassette. The signal-seeking radio is illuminated with green LED numerals and shows a linear graphic display when the volume knob is twisted or the balance, fade, bass, and treble switches are depressed. There are scan and seek buttons but no way to manually select a station via a knob or other means. I also found the sound rather weak, especially the bass.

Ford has always made excellent air conditioning systems for its cars and the Sable was no exception. The car is rapidly cooled despite the fact the car was sitting in the middle of an asphalt lot for 8 hours with the windows up. However, the feel of the controls was very cheap. In fact, all of the Sable's controls had a cheap tactile feel absent in other domestic and foreign cars I've driven. Another extreme disappointment was the fact that the Sable's rear windows didn't even go halfway down. 

The trunk is fairly large with a low liftover. A nice touch is small trays on each side for small items. The was, of course, a donut tire in lieu of a full-size spare.

All and all, I was disappointed with the Sable. It only justified my girlfriend's purchase of the base-model Chevrolet Impala, a car priced roughly the same as the Sable GS with a better drivetrain, interior and features.
