                   First I want to start out by addressing the whiners that say this car is noisy and cramped. This car isn't a family sedan nor does it have a little sewing machine engine. This is a SPORTS car! I don't mean to be rude but what do you expect? This car has a VVTL-i engine that packs 180+ horses under the hood. And personally from my perspective, I think the engine's purr sound great, however I am an admirer of the loud deep throaty sound of the porches, lamborghinis, etc.
       O.K. now that's off my chest I can address the more important things. In a nutshell THIS CAR IS AWESOME! From the yokohama's on the aluminum rims to the illuminated instrument panel the celica is a work of art. Many reviews say it's overpriced but as an owner I know that it's worth it. Also I've read may reviews that say &quot;the styling moves to the wild side but the engine turns toward the mild side&quot; -Only one part of that is true. I've raced a '00 Civic Si and a '00 Acura Integra both with VTEC V4's and killed them.
       And finally there is a crapload of aftermarket stuff for it. If your not familiar with TRD (toyota racing development) it is a company made by toyota and their parts are of excellent quality and since it's made by toyota it won't ruin your warrenty plus the TRD parts are under warrenty.

        Last, If you are considering buying a Celica- DO! and if you're considering an Integra or Civic or Accord please consider a celica. If you have any questions you're welcome to e-mail me @ Blake_09@yahoo.com and for more info and pics go to www.newcelica.org
