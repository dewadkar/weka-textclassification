            I bought a 1997 Mitsubishi Galant in March of 1999 with 21,000 miles for a great price of $8,900.  At first I was very pleased with the vehicle, and I was happy with the treatment by the dealership.  However, my experience soon took a turn for the worse.

In August of last year, I noticed a pronounced &quot;ticking&quot; sound coming from the engine.  Because I have worked on cars for years, I knew that it was a lifter problem.  I was by one dealership that lifters were not covered by my powertrain warranty, which is false, so eventually I had 6 of 16 lifters replaced under warranty.  About three months later, I noticed the tick again, accompanied by symptoms of oil burning.  I had carbon rings on my spark plugs and it seemed I was always a quart low.  I called the dealer service dept. and they told me it was normal.  After going through Mitsubishi national customer service, everyone was very helpful and it was determined that at 38,000 miles it was necessary to completely overhaul my engine.  This was also under warranty.

Since then, I have had little annoyances.  The horn stopped working, as the ground gave out.  The dash lights went out, a bad fuse.  A headlight went out, needing a new bulb.  All told, I have spent over $1,000 in the past year on non-covered repairs.  If you added the cost for warranty work, it would topple $4,500!  All for a three year old car with 45,000 miles!

I would not recommend this car to anyone.  It is fast, it drives nicely, and it looks great.  Unfortunately, the headaches accompanied make all that useless.

Update!!!!  Can you imagine that only a week later I am updating this epinion because more has gone wrong!  My tailights, dashboard, and door switch all went this week.  I am either going to drive the car off a cliff into the ocean or drive it into a brick wall.  What a piece of junk!<br><br>
