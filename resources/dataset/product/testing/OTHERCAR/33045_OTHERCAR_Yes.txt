            I love my Caravan!  We bought it because our old 4 door sedan was worn out, and we needed a newer, reliable vehicle.  All the reviews I have read said that the Caravan was THE van to buy.  I can honestly say that they are right on the money with that recommendation.  Even though we bought a used van, it was in great condition, and has rarely needed anything but the basic maintenance.  It is the most reliable car I have ever owned.  And when it is time to go buy another, I will definitely go with Dodge Caravan again.  I recommend this van to anyone who desires reliability, comfort, convenience, and plenty of space for passengers or cargo.  I only wish it got a little better gas mileage.  Especially since the gasoline formula was changed this last summer.  The gas mileage went down about 2 mpg, so now I only get about 15.5 mpg. Originally, I got about 18 mpg, and could get about 325 miles per tank of gas.  For my needs, that lasted all week long.  Now I have to refuel before the week is over.  Even with this drop in mpg, I still love my van.   <br><br>
