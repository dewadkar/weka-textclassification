            	In October of 98 I picked up one of the first 99 Sahara's when it arrived in the showroom. One thing one must do before purchasing a wrangler is contemplate your needs. Though I love my jeep I knew what I was getting into before my purchase. I wanted something Impractical and fun.
	The 99 Sahara is a great looking fun to drive vehicle. The 99 model features driver and passenger seats which spring assist you in flipping forward to allow access to the back seats which are comfortable for a short time. The front seats are very comfortable in which they hug your form keeping you in place on rough terrain.
       On long drives one will notice filling up their gas tank quite often which may get expensive due to the V-6 under the hood. The V-6 is recommended over the 4 cyl. for its pick up and towing abilities which is noticed compared to the 4 cyl.. 
       When passengers are riding in the back you will notice you cant hear them and they cant hear you due to the wind hitting the soft top. If you have the room and the extra money get the optional hard top to have around for long drives although I recommend always to go topless for that's why one owns a jeep. The full metal doors on the 99 model cut down on the wind and noise in the front seat. Also to cut down on the noise get the optional wind screen which attaches to the roll bar behind the front seats, you will notice sufficient wind reduction. If the noise from the wind bothers you turn up the radio which masks the wind. The sound bar adds to a nice system for a jeep. You can jam to the radio on the highway with the top down with no problem.
	I am surprised with the smooth ride this vehicle has due to the gas shocks. If two people are traveling a jeep makes a road trip more fun. Leave the back-seat empty for the luggage since there is no trunk. Though the lock box option comes in handy if you have a few valuables you want to keep safe. Although a Jeep seems like a rugged vehicle, its been upgraded to match the existing market. Electronic instrument clusters don't do well in all weather conditions so tighten down the hatches if it looks like rain.
	A jeep is not the most practical vehicle around so make sure you know your needs before investing into this pricey toy. All in all if your looking for a fun to drive, reliable, great looking car, be wild for once and get a jeep. You only live once!<br><br>
