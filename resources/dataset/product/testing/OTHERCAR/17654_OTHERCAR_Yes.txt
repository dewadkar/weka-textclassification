            This is actually a hand me down from my parents.  I've had it for about 3 years now.  They bought it new and have kept it well maintained, taking it in for every oil change and every scheduled maintenence.  I must say, at 6 years old, I think my car still looks very new.  

This car is the base model, so no frills.  V4 engine, not quite enough acceleration for a little young adult speed demon like myself, but nice enough for not being a V6 (or even better, a V8).  I LOVE the seats.  Cloth, very soft and very comfortable.  Unfortunately, comfortable enough to fall asleep in.  Not a good thing when you are driving.  I also like the way that Volvo manual seats adjust.  Most people don't like it though.  There is a big knob on the side of the seat that you twist to get to the right position.  I like this much better than the seat adjustment levers on other cars where I can't get the exact position I want and just settle for what I can get.  

The radio is fine.  Problem with it is that you can't play the radio if there is a tape in the tape deck.  You have to pop the tape out first.  The higher model radios do allow you to play the radio even if there is a tape in the tape deck.  I also sprung for the glove compartment 6-cd changer.  Very nice, very compact.  Plus, you can change the cds while you are sitting in traffic.  You don't have to jump out and pop the trunk to change cds =).  Trunk is very spacious and the back seats fold down 60/40.  I like the middle arm rest in the back seat.  There is access to the trunk through here for those long, slender objects you put in your trunk.  Also, the front seat folds down for those extra long purchases.  

I think the drive is nice.  A bit bumpy on the pothole-y and constantly ripped up streets in the city I live in, but that might change when I get my shocks changed.  I also believe the ride is very solid.  I don't feel like I am being blown around on the road when a huge gust of wind comes along or if a huge semi drives by.   

The only major problems I have had with the mechanic wise were a stripped oil pan (caused by an inept oil change place), anti-lock brake sensor light on the dash kept popping on (caused by inept tire changers, but luckily fixed within the warranty time period), and a alternator that pooped out for some reason.  These problems were very expensive to repair, but it goes with the territory, I guess. 

Things I don't like about my car.  The power window switches are located between the driver and passenger seat.  Why aren't they on the driver's side door?  Also, there aren't enough nook and cranies to put things in.  The glove compartment isn't that big and the little storage area between the driver and passenger seat is just that, little.  I have test driven a couple of newer model Volvos, and have noticed more storage spaces, however.
