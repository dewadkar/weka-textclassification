            This was my car I used through high school that I will never get rid of.  After driving it day in and day out for two and a half years, it feels like it has become me.

When I got the car, it turned into my hobby car.  All the cars I will own turn into my project car.  I took it apart and put it back together to learn its insides and outs.

Overtime I upgraded various parts like teenagers like to do with their cars.  The suspension, motor, and electrical system gladly accepted my changes.  The car will change its personality after every change from different sounds to control (I have not changed the muffler to sound like a weedwacker).

Integras have this image of 'having' to be fixed up.  Everytime I tell people that I have an Integra, the inevitable question of, &quot;Did you fix it up?&quot; comes along.  Yes, I fixed up my car a bit but just because I did it as a hobby, not to show-off to random people.

I've always argued how the second generation of Integras (1990-1993) have the best body style, but that is in the eye of the beholder.

The engine has more than enough power to pull past other cars in traffic and uphill, but a few upgrades wouldn't hurt.  Being that it is a front-wheel drive takes a bit of the fun away.

The handling felt somewhat like a sports car.  It wasn't completely a sports car feel but close.  It still feels like a passenger car.

I have 98,000 miles on it now and I haven't had any major problems asides from the regular maintenance stuff.

A few changes that I made to the car were pretty much a necessity.  A few things seemed like errors in manufacturing, like the gauge of the ground cable.

The exterior body tends to take quite a bit of dings.  No matter how careful anyone is, a slight nudge will most likely leave a minor indent.

I've always had a gripe the materials Honda uses to make the interior.  The material on the seats start feeling stiff after getting to know the car better.

A simple oil change isn't so simple.  It requires having to jack-up the car and get underneath to reach the oil filter.

There are NO cup holders which really sucks!

I still love my car though!<br><br>
