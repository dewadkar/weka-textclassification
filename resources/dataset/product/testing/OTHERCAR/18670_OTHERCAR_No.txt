            I had high hopes for the minivan that last year earned the number 1 ranking by Consumer Reports.  But upon visiting several dealerships in my area, I find that the vehicle doesn't live up to the hype.

<b>What's Good</b>
The 2002 Honda Odyssey is available in three trims: LX, EX, and EX-L.  
All Odyssey comes with the powerful 240 horsepower, 3.5 - liter V6 engine.  Torque has been increased to provide more kick off the line and during mid-range acceleration. 
Helping acceleration is the new 5-speed automatic transmission, which is standard on all trims.  
Side airbags are now standard.

<b>What's Bad</b>
A car-like all-independent suspension, unusual for a minivan, has been returned for a supposedly better ride. However, the test drive sometimes gets jerky on wavy pavement or bumpy roads.  
The powerful engine is the reason behind its poor fuel economy, on top of that, the small fuel tank really limits cruising range.  
The shortened steering-column-mounted transmission shift lever still is too long and it's easy to shift into the wrong gear.
All Odyssey trims have dual sliding doors that are powered, except for the base LX model.  The power doors move too slow, and attempting to control them with buttons is hard, even the sales rep had trouble with it.  
The spare tire is hard to get.  
Finally for those that are cost-conscious, the Odyssey is much more expensive than comparable domestic models, and the limited supply of the vehicle in my area makes bargaining even harder.
