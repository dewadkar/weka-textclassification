            I flew to Arizona a couple of year's ago to visit my brother and he had just bought a prizm. He lives in Phoenix metro area and it has a lot of stop and go traffic as well as excursions on the interstate. I was prepared for a bumpy ride and poor air conditioning from this &quot;bargain vehicle&quot; but my experience was just the opposite. I love the fact this car handled so well and the environmental controls really swept the hot desert air out of the car even when it was sitting in the sun for hours. This car was suprisingly roomy, comfortable and quick despite the standard 4 cylinder automatic it was equipped with. The only thing I hated about this car was trunk space which was limited. The gas mileage was fantastic!!!!! When I left Arizona I bought a Prizm within 6 months. You really have to drive the car to appreciate it. I would recommend this car for commutes as well as stop and go traffic. Lead foots who do a lot of passing on the interstate will not like the power which is only quick enough for most.<br><br>
