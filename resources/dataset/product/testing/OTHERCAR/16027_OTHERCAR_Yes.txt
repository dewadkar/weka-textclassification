            The Toyota Camry is one FINE automobile.  Built on a LEXUS chassis, it offers a smooth, comfortable ride.  The interior offers plenty of leg room - my 6'2&quot; father commented the other day that our Camry had more leg room than his 1998 Lincoln Town Car - and he's right!  The 4 cylinder engine offers plenty of power on the highway and from a dead stop, and averaging 28-30 mpg, I wouldn't ever buy a 6 cylinder, unless you wanted to sacrifice gas mileage - the 4 cyl. is very peppy. Maintenance has been a breeze - we changed the timing belt at 108,000 miles and have done NO other major mechanical work in the 3+ years we've owned the car. Even the brakes took over 115,000 miles to be changed! Did I luck out? I doubt it - from what I understand Toyota is #1 (Honda - #2) in terms of reliability.  This car is for ANYONE who loves a good VALUE and wants a safe, low maintenance car to drive. The Camry is what a car should BE. Enjoy!! <br><br>
