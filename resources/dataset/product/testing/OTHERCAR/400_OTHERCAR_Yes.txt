            Everything ever written or said about this vehicle has been in comparison to the Jeep Cheroke. Every head to head review I have ever seen has always rated the Extera just a bit above the Cheroke. Now I have no problems with that, except for where the points were awarded higher than the Cheroke's. The Extera is far inferior when it comes to performance and off-road ability. Two major parts of a sports utility. But the Extera wins in on-road ride, interior comfort, and design. The Fact that the Cheroke has only had one make-over in over 14 years of production should stand as testamen to the Cheroke's functionality. I agree that in todays world where sport utilities are used almost ecxclusively on-road. But, a sport utility should still have off-road better off-road capability then the jacked up station wagons that are flooding the market.
  When it comes to looks, the Extera definatley looks good, except for the rediculous lump in the back door (hatch). I understant that it is a first-aid kit, and that is cool, but find a place for it inside the car, do not ruin the lines of the car. It looks very capable of tackling almost anything, now it just needs the underpinnings to go with it. I am not 100% against this truck, but it still needs a little work, like balancing the on-road ride, with improved off-road ability, and performance. The 3.0L V6, just does not have the power to keep up with its competitors. 170 h.p. is just not enough, to propell 3500+Lbs. 
  All things aside it does a good job of projecting a tough and rugged image, no it just needs the ball to back it up.
