            Having owned and enjoyed European sedans such as BMW and Audi, I mistakenly took this car to be of similar character. One periodical which tested the car said it had stable but not sporting handling and I found that a true comment. The strong points of the car are throttle response and braking. The handling and steering are what I would call numb and unrewarding, particularly compared to BMW or even a 97 Subaru wagon I've owned. Absolutely no one over 6' in height should buy this car. Its very cramped inside and unfortunately I didn't reach that conclusion till after I bought it. I am 6'3&quot; tall. This car should be fine for shorter people who don't care about a car being fun to drive.<br><br>
