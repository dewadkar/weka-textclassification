            I got a 1994 Saturn SL1 as part of my 18th birthday present. We weren't even looking for a Saturn, I was just looking at cars. I preferred a Toyota or a Honda, just because of the reliability. So when I stopped by this car dealership and saw this cute little gold Saturn, I wasn't really impressed. My mom has a Saturn though, so I decided to take it for a test drive anyway. I loved it! It accelerated well, and it handled very well. I like the size of it, inside and out. The back seat looks small, but really it's not. I has in the drivers seat, my 6'2 boyfriend was in the passenger, and my "large" dad was in the back behind me and his knees weren't even touching the back of my seat. I had to get a few things done to the car before I could take it home (the dealer's fault, not a fault of the car), and I got it back Sunday. I've been driving it everyday, almost all day since then. It's great.

INTERIOR
Like I've said, the interior is a nice size. It's a small car looking at it from the outside, so those who expect to be able to fit the Harlem Globetrotters inside are a deluded bunch. I didn't have the original stereo with the car, so I can't comment on that. But the controls for the air conditioning/heater are easy to access. You can adjust the height of the steering wheel in case you can't see the speedometer, but since I'm short (5'4) I have it on the lowest height. It's pretty spacious inside for such a small car though, and everything is within reach of the driver.

EXTERIOR
I personally like the look of the car. I like the angled design of the outside of the car. I can't say too much for the durability of the car cause I haven't hit anything (yet, knock on wood). But the bumper and the fender are a black plastic, so I'm guessing if shopping carts were launched at my car, it wouldn't be too messed up.

ETC.
I'm not an expert on the engine and what not of cars, but I think the engine is pretty good for a car of that size, and of that age. But when I'm on the freeway, it speeds enough when I'm getting onto the freeway, and also if I need to pass someone (which I do a lot, lol). 

All in all, I think the car is pretty damn good, and if someone is looking for a first car for their child, definitely look into getting a Saturn, used or otherwise. 


***UPDATES*** (12/04/03)

By request from a comment left for me, I've decided to add more information now that I've had the car for a little over 2 weeks now. I've frequently driven the car on the freeway, back and forth from home to my boyfriend's house 20 miles away, and it's not noisy at all. It does take a few seconds to speed up if you need to pass someone quickly, but it's just a 4-cylinder, so this isn't drag racing material. I have an automatic, and it shifts smoothly to me compared to other cars I've driven, i.e. my mom's 2003 Saturn L300 and my dad's 1994 Ford Escort. I love the handling on this car. I'm an impatient driver sometimes, and I can switch lanes with the best of them without having to swerve back and forth to get the wheel straight. Besides the 4-cylinder engine, this car has a nice sporty feel to it. I don't know...the look of the car inside and out is awesome, and it's small size is good for small parking spaces and for getting into different lanes. The trunk space is excellent. I don't have much back there now, but I did get into it once to show the amount of space in there to a friend of mine. I'd say it could fit myself and half of me in there, lol. Hmmm...gas mileage. Well, I've only filled up my tank completely one time and it cost $17.00 @ $1.65/gallon. And I got about 150-200 miles out of it, maybe more I wasn't really paying attention, most were highway miles. Hmmm...that's all I can add for now, if more comes up , I'll post it!
