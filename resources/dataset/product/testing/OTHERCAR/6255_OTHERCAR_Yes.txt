              I bought a 97' Nissan truck a little while ago for only 10,000 dollars.  The reason I bought this truck is because trucks have the highest resale value and I looked in Kelly's Blue Book and found out that I could sell my truck for about 13,800.  That is a big difference, and in about ten years, I could probably sell my truck for a little less than what I paid for it.  If you are going to buy a truck, buy a Nissan because American trucks break down all the time and are not reliable.  If you don't want to spend all of your money repairing your truck, then buy a Nissan truck and you will find out that you will be able to drive it over 250,000 miles easily.  Anyone should buy this truck!<br><br>
