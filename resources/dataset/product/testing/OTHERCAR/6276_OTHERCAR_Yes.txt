            In March of 2000, my search for the perfect luxury car began simply enough.  I searched for a luxury car that cost under $10,000.  After reading several reviews of the resulting cars, I choose to look more closly at the Oldsmobile LSS.  The small picture seemed to look more sporty than Olds are known for, and the list of standard features was unbelievable.  It matched every single feature I required and many more that I didn't think I could afford.  

After a quick search for an LSS at autotrader.com I found one for just the right price only 60 miles from me.  After seeing the car I still couldn't believe what a bargin this car is.  Frankly, if it had any other manufacter's name on the bumper it would sell for 50% more!  Once I realized that this car isn't my father's Olds, I began to see the sporty styling and luxurious interior.  

Driving this car is a dream.  Thankfully the suspension is tighter than most cars in this class.  My last car was a Buick Park Ave and my major complaint was that it felt like I was floating.  The LSS provides that luxury feeling ride without loosing a tactile feel of the road.
