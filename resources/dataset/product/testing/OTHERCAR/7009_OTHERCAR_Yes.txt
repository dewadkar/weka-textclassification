            	The new Sequoia is a very hot item on the market right now. It's a little bigger than the land cruiser but it's not priced as high as the land cruiser. The Sequoia has the same engine as the land cruiser but it does have a little more power than the established land cruiser.


   The Sequoia has a 4.7 Liter V8 engine with 240 horse power. This SUV rides like a car with a smooth turning diameter of 42.3 feet. The Sequoia can tow up to 6500 pounds just like the land cruiser. The major differences between the two are it's price, and body frame.


   The Land cruiser has established itself on the market for years, and everyone knows exactly what the Land Cruiser looks like. The Sequoia is a fairly new toy on the market that is built on a frame based on the
Tundra. What toyota did was basically but another body on the Tundra frame and called it the Sequoia.


   The Sequoia has a power rear window that can be activated up or down with one touch of the keyless remote. The Land Cruiser offers an available navigational system with DVD player. The Land Cruiser also has an available third row of seats and the Sequoia doesn't have that option yet.


   If you're in the market for a big SUV, and you have a lot of children or a lot of companions,the affordable new Sequoia is the SUV for you. The new SR5 Sequoia is priced at $39600. Big difference from the 
higher priced Land cruiser at $62000.
