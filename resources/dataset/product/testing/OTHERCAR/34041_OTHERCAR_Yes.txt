            When my 1986 Honda Accord died after almost 200,000 miles, my parents found me a 1991 Chevrolet Cavalier Station Wagon.  It was a low mileage, one owner car that cost under $3000 dollars.  Lacking features such as anti-lock brakes, power windows, or cruise control, I thought that I was in for an uncomfortable ride.  I was wrong.  The Chevy Cavalier Station Wagon handles surprisingly well for its size.  Its braking is a little softer than I am used to, but it does the job even in bad road conditions.  It doesn't have very good acceleration but it drives nicely once you get to highway speeds. Maintenance is easy and affordable.  The only real disadvantage with this car is its gas mileage.  I can go only half as far on a tank of gas as I could in my Honda, and the tanks are the same size.  Also, the driver needs to keep a close eye on the temperature gauge because Chevrolet Cavaliers have a reputation for overheating.

The hauling power of this station wagon is impressive.  This fall, I hauled everything I needed for college in one trip.  Another time, I hauled a couch that is over 6 feet long. The only disadvantage of the station wagon design is that there is nowhere convenient to store car essentials such as extra oil, power steering fluid or ice scrapers.  I use a large Rubbermaid container with a tight fitting lid to keep all of these supplies together.

I would recommend this car for young families with children.  It is not a &quot;cool&quot; car for the college student, but with its ample space it shouldn't be completely dismissed.    <br><br>
