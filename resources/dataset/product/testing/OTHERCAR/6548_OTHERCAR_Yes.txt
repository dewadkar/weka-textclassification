            We purchased a 97 Grand Caravan ES and have really enjoyed this van. It drives like a car, the ride is smooth and not at all &quot;truck-like&quot;. It is plenty roomy, even for my husband who is 6'4&quot; and head room and leg room is a big issue with him (no pun intended!) We ordered ours fully loaded, with the quad seating, a definite plus to keep kids from bothering each other during long drives. It has the cd/cassette stereo system, the larger 3.8 engine, which was a big factor in buying this model. We found that this engine had much better pick up and felt that it would last longer since we will probably have this car for several years. 

We have had no problems with this van other than the cd player breaking shortly after we bought it and of course the dealer put a new one in right away. We do have the computerized console overhead and I love this feature because it always gives me the temperature outside. We did have a computer chip fail on this, but again, the dealer fixed that right away. It also has a place to put the garage door opener and a place for sunglasses. Tons of cupholders, the third seat is easy to get out, although it is heavy, so two people should handle it. The dual sliding doors are a big plus, especially when one child is in a car seat which is located in the seat that does not fold up to get in the back. <br><br>
