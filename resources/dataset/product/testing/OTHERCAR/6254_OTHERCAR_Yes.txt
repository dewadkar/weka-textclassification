            This truck I would probably rate higher than Ford, and Ford is my absolute favorite kind.  The Frontier, for some reason, just beats everything else.  It is strong, fast, fully loaded, durable, heavy duty, you name it.

The suspension on this works well for a very quiet and peaceful ride, with little or no bumps at all.  The steering is tight as well, and no play at all.  It responds as soon as the wheel is moved.

I noticed when driving the one we had that the 4wd is very strong.  The front wheels can pull just about as much as the back wheels can push.

The gas mileage on this truck was interesting to me.  Most people would expect larger trucks to have generally less gas mileage, but not the Frontier.  This truck, even with a full load and 4wd, could maintain a good 22 to 25 miles to the gallon.  Without 4wd, and unloaded, higher than that, and still higher on open highway.<br><br>
