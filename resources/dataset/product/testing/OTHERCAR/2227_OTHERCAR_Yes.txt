            Well, this is a great car, no doubt, but it has it's problems. Although this car is my Dad's car, I have driven it quite a bit, so I fill that I can speak my opinion on it.

My Dad bought this car used with 45,000 miles on it. It had been well taken care of, but you could see the wear and tear on it. Evidently the previous owners had pulled a boat or something, because a lot of rust was on and around the trailer hitch. Anyway, It's a great SUV. My Dad is a Construction Supervisor and it fits him to a tee. It's not a 4WD model. My Dad dosen't need that, plus the 2WD model saves a lot of gas. 

Here we go, The Pros, I thing that anyone that needs i roomy SUV, this is a great choice. The back seats fold down to give you about 7 feet of depth to store stuff. It's an easy SUV to clean as well. The &quot;curves&quot; are easy to clean, and also easy to wax. It comes with a 4 speaker stereo. I installed a Pioneer CD player so that we could listen to CDs. The factory speakers are surprisingly very sturdy. You can really pump some power into the speakers with very low distortion. I'm a freak about sound, and I know some good sounding speakers. The oil is extremely easy to change on this SUV as well. I'm not sure about the 4WD model, but this 2WD model is very easy to do maintenance on.

Ok, The Cons, The interior has become very noisy. The jack is stored in the back left corner of the rear. If you don't secure it down with super glue, IT&quot;S GONNA RATTLE!! This has been the most annoying thing that I have to say about this SUV. Also, the drivers side door has somehow become dislodged from the door frame itself. We haven't been able to reattach it yet. The durability of the SUV is the only thing in question.

Overall, it's a good choice for someone that needs room. It's got decent acceleration, and gets good gas mileage, about 25 MPG. <br><br>
