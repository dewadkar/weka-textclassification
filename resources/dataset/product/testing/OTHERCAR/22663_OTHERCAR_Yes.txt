            <b>The Pontiac Grand Am is really a car for everyone... almost.</b>

We first purchased the Pontiac Grand Am after checking several different car lots.It most appealed to us because it was only a year old at the time (1998) and was a lot cheaper than a brand new one.It has an exceptionally smooth ride and gorgeous interior.

The problems with the insides I can deal with sometimes but I know others won't like.The seats inside the Pontiac Grand Am are quite small.They aren't like Lincoln cars where the seats are huge and incredibly comfortable.The Pontiac Grand Am's seats are called &quot;bucket seats&quot; by the dealer ownership.These seats have curved edges on both sides.This is the only part I didn't like about my car.

The gas mileage is very good.If your sick of paying high gas prices for your Chevy Blazer or some big truck you should find a smaller car with better gas mileage like the Pontiac Grand Am.

Personally we never ever had a problem with the engine,brakes,or anything else.The only time it needed to be taken to the shop is when the window got a little crack in it that kept spreading.This was the fault of a car in front of us that had little bits of sand and rock blowing from it's back part.

Furthermore with the good things about this car, we have had it well over a year now and the new car smell is still there! Every time I get into drive it I feel like stepping into a brand new car.This is really nice for people who like that new car smell.

The dash board on the car can come with a cd player if you pay extra.A sunroof is also optional.Together these extras can run the price for your car up a tad.

We didn't get the extras since we found no need for them.The basic Pontiac Grand Am comes equipped with a tape player and AM/FM radio to listen to.There is bass control and volume control as well.

The air conditioning is exceptionally well.Never had a problem with that either.Keeping the car nice and cool during the summer, and keeping you tosty and warm during the winter really is a plus for this car.

Our last car we had didn't even have a radio or air conditioning/heat.It was a very bad car we received from a recently passed away relative.A Chevy Nova 1976! It was a very ugly color also.Now it just sits outside on the curb someday to be taken to the inpound lot.

<b>Pontiac Grand AM: Colors</b>

If you've decided to purchase a Pontiac Grand Am and are wondering what colors it comes in, here is a short list to help you out.(there are more colors that are harder to find than the ones below I believe)

Colors:

White
Grey
Blue (dark blue)
Green 
Black
Red (found a few different shades of red so far)

Interior Colors:

The interior of this car can come with leather in some models I have seen, yet the version we purchased came with a cloth that was a grey color and was kind of rough feeling (that's why we put blankets over the seats now).



<b>Overall</b> - B+

<b>Recommend for</b> - People who need a car that works and is in good shape all the time but cannot afford a car over fifteen thousand.
