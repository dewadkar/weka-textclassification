            I recently purchased my Kia Sportage in Feb 99.  It's a 4-door automatic with all the standard equipment.  I bought this car on an impulse buy, but have been reasonablyl satisfied with the purchase.  One thing I dislike about it is that these SUV's only come in a standard 4 cylinder engine with no V-6 available (bummer).  But taking in consideration the engine, it does have adequate pick up.  It brakes well, takes turns decent.  But it will TIP if pushed too far, believe me, I tried it.  The sportage has a high center of gravity which makes it top heavy.  The seating is better than expected to passengers, and the flip up folding seat in the rear is great for hauling cargo.  Basically, you get what you pay for, they start at around 14,000 and go up to around 19,000 loaded.  Which is a much better price than the competition out there.  I test drove a Honda CRV and a Toyota Rav4, and while these are great little SUV's, they are not worth the outrageous price.  <br><br>
