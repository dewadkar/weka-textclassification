            The HP315 is a great value for the price.  It is easy to use and takes pretty good pictures.  Besides being convenient to carry it is a good looking camera.  I like the pictures it takes. I have taken pictures indoors and outdoors and I can't say that there is one problem. Neither is inferior.  I have already purchased another memory card.  The card that came with it is rather small.  I like the idea of having the opportunity of taking more photos.  The quality on the medium setting is fine.  It takes less memory and prints out nicely.  The quality of the best setting is great but it does suck up the memory.  Of course, that isn't going to be a problem with the larger memory card.  I have recommended it to friends.I did talk a friend into buying one.
