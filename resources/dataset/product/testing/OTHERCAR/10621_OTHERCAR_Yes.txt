            I gave up my Jeep Grand Cherokee for a Leganza.  I couldn't be more pleased - except if the cup holders were bigger.  That is my ONLY gripe. I have put 15,000 miles on it since 12/99.  There's not been one rattle,  squeak or noted imperfection.  Everything fits as it should.  

Standard features include anti-lock brakes, CD player AND cassette player, dual heated and electric-controlled side mirrors, leather seats, tachometer, cruise control, rear defroster, power windows, power door locks with remote keyless entry, tinted glass, A/C, variable assist power steering, center console, lockable glove box, center console, automatic transmission, dual airbags, plus...

Great car for the money!!<br><br>
