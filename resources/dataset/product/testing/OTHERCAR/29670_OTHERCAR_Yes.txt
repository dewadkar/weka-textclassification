            If you are looking for a high quality, comfortable, performing vehicle under $25,000, the new Buick Regal is for you.

The Regal offers superior ride and comfort for a vehicle in this price range.  The LS model gives you all the options while keeping the price around 22-23k.  The big V6 engine provides plenty of power while maintaining good gas mileage.

If you think that Buick's are &quot;Grandma&quot; cars then think again.  This is a new Buick Regal.  If you really want a performance car, step up to the Regal GS.  This model gives you the fine leather interior and a Supercharged V6 that is VERY fast.

The bottom line is...if you are looking in this price range, DO NOT buy another car until you at least test drive the new Buick Regal.<br><br>
