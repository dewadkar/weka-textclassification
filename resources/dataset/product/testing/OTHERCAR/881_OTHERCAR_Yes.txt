            Rule number one for buying high tech gadgets is to never look at a newspaper ad after you've bought something.
I bought an Olympus C2000Z back in 11/99 and love the layout and the ease of control.  Recently, I saw an ad for the C3000 at a price lower than what I paid for for the C2000Z but with more features, I had to check it out.  
First, unlike the C2000Z, the C3000 is made in Japan.  Not that the "made in Japan" is a stamp of quality, since Thailand makes some nice electronics these days, but I was sold by that immediately.  The quality, fit and finish are superior to the C2000Z.  The quicktime movie mode that records audio took away my need to buy a digital videocam.
The C2000Z however, can take better pictures in the dark than the C3000 though.  It's largest aperature is F2 instead of F2.8, and unlike intuition, that is DOUBLE the lens opening.  However, I noticed less barrel distortion with the C3000 so I sacrificed a faster lens for a less distorted picture.  I can always use the flash if I need to.
This time, I'm not going to look at anymore newspaper ads, at least for now.


3/2001 update:  I did, I broke rule #1 and looked at an ad! now I would like to sell the C3000 and get the C3040...main reason? faster lens.....you might read my review on the C3040 soon.
