            I bought the Saturn SL1 from a local car dealer. It is a 1992 model. I am very pleased with the car. It is well built and solid. There are no rattles or squeaks and it is very quiet, even when driving on the Interstate. I really like the side panels being made from a polymer product instead of steel. That way, there is almost no damage from shopping carts and idiots that park right next to you and throw their doors open (bang!). I am a big guy (over 6 feet and over 200 pounds) and I still can fit in the back seat. Granted, it isn't roomy, but I do fit.

I have had almost no problems with the car. However, I took it to a mechanic to replace the serpentine belt because it was getting worn and he put on the wrong size belt. This resulted in damage to the alternator which had to be replaced.

The gas mileage is ok. I haven't really kept track, but I only need to fill up about every other week, and that is with using the car to commute daily to and from work. I also use the car a lot on weekends because of the 4 doors (my other car is a Camaro Z28 and is definitely not meant for more than 2 adults).

The only things of a negative nature are the performance and the parts. Because of the small engine, there isn't much in the way of acceleration. However, there is a button on the automatic transmission for normal driving and performance driving. The button just allows the engine to rev to a higher RPM before shifting to the next gear. As for the parts, it seems that the only place that you can get most Saturn parts are from the dealer and everybody knows how expensive that is!<br><br>
