            My first car was a 1994 Mitsubishi Eclipse RS(base). At the time I was 16 and it was my birthday present. I couldn't complain about the car at the time but I did. With its poor performance of 92-94hp from the small 4 cylinder engine I'm surprised it didn't blow up in my young hands. After a year of driving the exhaust was shot! After 63,000 miles it was time to replace the automatic transmission in the car. As far as mechanical difficulties that was it. The other thing that broke in the car FOUR TIMES was the cigarette lighter? Don't know why but it's on the service records. Last but not least the resale of the car sucks!! I received $4,000 for it towards the purchase of my BMW 325is which is far superior automobile. For a 16 year old its great, when your 22 throw it away!<br><br>
