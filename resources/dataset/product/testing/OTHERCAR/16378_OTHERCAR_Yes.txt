            I purchased this camera last Christmas for my wife(hehe). I can tell you she is thrilled with it even if she has never taken a picture. The camera is an absolute bargain for the price. It has easy to use controls and is fairly rugged for a digital camera. I have taken this camera on Kayak trips, mountain biking and numerous trips to the sandy beaches of California. It has not missed a beat. The software that comes with the camera is also very easy to use and allows the user to adjust the image of the photographs before they are printed. In addition to the practical easy to use features it came with a 100 Dollar rebate from HP. I think anyone interested in digital photography would be very happy with the value the receive from this camera. Dollar for Dollar it is a very good camera<br><br>
