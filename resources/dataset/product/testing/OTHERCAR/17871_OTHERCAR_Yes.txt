            My Blazer is a 1995 2 door model.  I bought it brand new and have not had a single problem!  The Blazer runs smooth.  The Blazer looks sporty and yet I can haul a ton of stuff.  
I originally bought the Blazer to haul around teenagers.  There is plenty of leg and head room front and back. I love the cup holders and hidden storage capabilities for each of the back seats.  The kids could put a ton of stuff in the side panels and that kept the mess and clutter down in the Blazer.  
I also love the fact my Blazer came with a full size spare tire!  Bad thing about the spare is it's inside the back of the Blazer which at times is in the way.  Hauling large items I have found I had to take the spare out.  
The best thing about the 95 Blazer?   The built in compass and thermometer!  Speaking from the stand point of a person that gets lost easily, I love the COMPASS!!  
The Blazer is fun to drive!
