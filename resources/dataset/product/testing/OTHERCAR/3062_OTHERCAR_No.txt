                 I recently got smart and got rid of a 1996 Dodge Intrepid!  I was so excited when I bought it.It was the first &quot;family&quot; car I had ever had, yet it didn't look like something grandma would drive.  It was plum colored an ES, with aluminum wheels, everything.  I bought it used for around 13,000.  I really liked the built in child seat in the back.  They didn't make very many of those in the intrepids. I continued to love this car, that had a nice quiet, smooth ride, until I had 70,000 miles on it.  I drive about 30,000 miles in a year.

     When I reached 70,000 miles, all hell broke loose.  First the water pump went out.  I had the 3.5 engine, and the water pump and labor was over $400.00. Ouch!!  Then the water pump went out 2 more times as did the timing belt.  Next, I had to replace 2 oxygen sensors.  They were $80.00 each.  This particular engine has 4 of them.  Then came the left outer tie rod end.  Not cheap, about $200.00 with labor.  Then I had to replace the radiator.  I was still having overheating problems even after the 3 water pumps.  Finially, I replaced a bushing on the rack and pinion.  I ended up with about 4 inches of steering wheel play.  That cost about $300.00.  After that was replaced, another bushing went out on the rack and pinion.  Great!  Problem- this particular bushing couldn't be replaced without buying the entire rack system!! About $1000.00!!!  I decided not to keep the car, I didn't spend the $1000.00, I just traded it while it was still running.  It was still overheating and I was afraid that I may have cracked heads (about $2000.00).  

    From what I've heard, if you have an Intrepid, you either love it or hate it.  There is no in between.  Well, you've heard my opinion.  I have heard that the new body style of intrepid has all of the bugs worked out.
