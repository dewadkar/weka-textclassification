            My wife and I bought the Caravan because we needed more room to carry our dogs around,(Greyhound &amp; Whippet). We love it for the room and storage space. I have the third seat out so we have more storage in back. I like sitting up high and the great view of the road. I have the small 4 cylinder engine it does lack some power on mountain roads but overall it is very nice drive.
We bought the van new in May 1999 and have had a few minor problems,passenger door handle had to be replaced, tail gate door had to be repainted (had some bubbles along bottom edge, and just had to have horn replaced) this may seem like a lot but it was all covered under the warranty and so far I'm very happy with this van.
My wife is short (4'9&quot;) she had to sit on pillows to drive our other car but does not need anything for the van.<br><br>
