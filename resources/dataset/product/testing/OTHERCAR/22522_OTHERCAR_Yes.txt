               My dad drove this car for his work over the course of five years. After this time I bought it from him for a very small amount of money. I can't tell you how much you will pay for it on the market, but it shouldn't be more that seven or eight grand. When I bought the car it had a total of one hundred and eighty thousand miles on it. It had the oil and transmission fluid changed regularly and the interior was in good condition. 
   Over all the car was in good repair, but the key to any car is the mechanical structure. This was wonderful. I know a good amount about most american cars, and this one is very nice. The steering and brakes were still tight. The transmission didn't slip or pull. My gas system still ran clean and efficient. The only problem with the car was the altenator, but I guess you can't have everything. I fixed the altenator for about $150, and just to be safe I replaced the battery and some of the more worn wiring. In the end I had a running very well running and almost sporty car for only $200 after initial cost. 
   I would definetly recommend this car to any one who is looking for a good street cruiser, work car, family car, or any other day to day transportation.  I wouldn't recomment this to someone who is looking for a car to do road trips in though, because the seats are somewhat uncomfortable.<br><br>
