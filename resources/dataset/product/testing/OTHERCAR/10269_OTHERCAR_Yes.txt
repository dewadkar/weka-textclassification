            No fault of the car, but since I own two of them (97 Sentra GXE manual for me, 98 200SX auto for the wife) I just keep finding myself looking at newer and bigger cars.

I bought the Sentra new and immediately noticed a moaning sound at idle from the air intake system.  After much fighting with Nissan (and no solution) they offered me a 6 year/100,000 warrantee in exchange for my not pursuing a lemon law action, which I accepted as the noise is actually quite minor and has diminished over time to be barely noticeable now.

I did have one problem at 31,000 miles with some sort of sensor (EGR?) that caused difficulty with cold starts and slightly poorer gas mileage (from 29 to 25), but it was fixed in two hours under warrantee and there have been no other significant troubles.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that the stereo is crappy (much better in the 98 200SX, CD even) and also have had squeeks and rattles in the front passenger and driver areas, probably from the dashboard or just behind.  I also thought that the stock tires (General AmeriGS) were rather poor handling.  I replaced them at 5,000 miles (which I do with most of my cars) with a set of slightly oversize Pirelli P400s (185/70/13) and the difference in handling and braking is like night and day, with a slight penalty in gas mileage (1 or 2 mpg) and tire noise.

The interior is nice enough, with all of the power goodies and the cruise control doing what they are supposed to do, and nothing looking or feeling too cheap except for the lack of a tachometer.  The shifter is really a delight and the clutch has good feel, which mated to the surprisingly powerful engine makes for a fun drive.

My only real complain is that I feel like I've outgrown the car.  While my family of 3 fits inside perfectly well, I just want something bigger and nicer like perhaps an Accord or Camry.

Just sold the car last weekend to buy a new 2002 Mitsubishi Galant.  At the time of trade-in, the Sentra had 56,400 miles on it, and except for the two squeeks behind the dash (a bit worse) and the moaning at idle (almost completely gone now), the car looked and felt pretty-much the same as it did the day I took off the dealer's lot four and a half years ago.

Other that that sensor or valve described above, the car had no other manufacturer-related repairs.  I did have to replace the radiator, but that was the fault of a rock, not a manufacturing or design defect.  I put in a new clutch at 49,000 miles (I really flogged this car), a new set of Pirellis at 44,000, and since I got a very good coupon, did the 60,000 mile service early at 52,000 ($100, really!!).

Based on my experience with this car, I can heartily recommend the 1995 through 1997 Sentra, but in 1998 production moved from Tennessee to Mexico, and I have no idea if quality went down in that transition or not.  If you are looking for a good used car, these are very hard to beat for the price.

Summary:
Good engine, transmission (stick), steering (with premium tires) and braking, far better than what an econo-car should do.  It really is fun to drive agressively in this car, and the car will reward you with very stable handling and no nasty surprises.

The seats are comfortable enough for what they are, but don't expect them to compete with those in a midsize car.  Likewise the engine is fairly quiet, but there is wind and road noise, not to mention the busy feel that simply comes from driving such a small car, at least at the 80-85mph I usually cruise at.

Back seat and trunk are well-designed, being far more spacious than one would expect on such a small car.  While the new-style Sentra is larger in every dimension, there is very little real-world gain in comfort and people/cargo space.
