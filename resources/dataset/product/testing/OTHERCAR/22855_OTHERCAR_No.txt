            Shopping for a used car? Avoid the Olds Calais.  I was actually reasonably pleased with my car for the first six years.  Both front headlight module broke and it was $400 to replace to pass inspection.  But I could tolerate that if that was going to be the biggest problem.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  At 70,000 mile, THE ENGINE BLEW.  It became completely useless.  This happened despite the fact that the oil was changed FAITHFULLY every 3,000 miles.  I had it towed to a relative who does engines.  When I called him and I told him it was a Calais, he asked be if it was the Quad 4 engine. I wasn't sure, but he said it probably was and he guaranteed that it was finished.  He replaced quite a few. He then gave me my biggest worry.  He could put in an replacement for $1500, but it would be a used Quad 4....only a matter of time.  At least it was cheaper than a new car. The car actually rides well gets good gas mileage, heats and cools well, etc. But if the engine can't give you more miles, why take the risk.  Buy something else. MOST IMPORTANTLY, DON'T BUY A USED ONE. As my cousin the mechanic said, it's only a matter of time.<br><br>
