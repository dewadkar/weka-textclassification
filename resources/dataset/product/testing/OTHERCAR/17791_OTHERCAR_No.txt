            Although this van is a great heavy lifter it has terrible brakes and handling because of the extra weight from the all wheel drive.  Very easy to get into an exit ramp a little too fast and then be looking for a handful of brakes.  The van carries so much weight from the AWD equipment I think that this vehicle could be dangerous in the hands of an inexperienced driver.

Pretty noisy interior at 65 MPH.  

I will say that having driven many rear wheel drive vans in snow this AWD is pretty good in the snow.

Highway mileage about 20. Much worse around town

Starter problems at 75,000 miles.

Too little foot room for passenger.

Takes two people to remove the rear seat and even then it is still difficult.

Terrible drivers seat.  Actually painful after about 6 hours.
