            This has to be the coolest thing since the polaroid!  It takes great pictures and you get instant results!  Instead of expensive film if the shot is no good, POOF-you delete it.  

Downloading couldn't be easier- Pop the disk in your drive and you have instant access to print, email or edit your picture.  This has been the greatest for me because I have a new baby and I was going through 5-10 rolls of film a WEEK!  The investment is truly worthwhile!  It is a bit expensive up front, but it pays for itself over and over when you consider you are making around a $12 investment every time you buy a roll a film and have it developed.

The camera is easy to use, lightweight, and has a high resolution picture.  In a large room some shots may not come out, but I think it is because I don't have it set right-and that happens with my other cameras also.  Mine has a 3x zoom and a mpeg feature.  I don't use the mpeg and I would recommend checking out the new 10x zoom.  Overall I have been extremely pleased with this camera.  Also it is great for parties and get togethers because you can give the disk to a friend as a reminder of the event or just make copies of the disk and give it away!  Lots cheaper than making copies or scanning your pictures!<br><br>
