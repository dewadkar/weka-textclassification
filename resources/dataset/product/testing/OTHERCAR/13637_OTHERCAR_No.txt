            My 1998 Kia Sportage EX is now two years old and has just hit the 32,000 mile mark.  I knew what I was buying (an inexpensive, highly accessorized, good-looking SUV). I have no complaints about the ride (it's a truck!), the gas-mileage (it's competitive), or the comfort (I'm 6'4&quot; and I make many long-distance trips). I really like driving this vehicle.  Now for the dark side!  In two years it has been in for service nine times!.  My service provider (not the dealer I bought my Sportage from--but, that's another nightmare story) has been terrific.  Even though they didn't profit from a sale, they have been extremely professional and competent--they even provide a shuttle service.

Kia Recalls:

ABS Brakes
Electrical Harness 

Repairs (under warranty):

Engine wouldn�t start three times (cleaned starter/cables on two service calls)
Dome light (replaced bulb)
Engine warning light has illuminated on three occasion�s (received a pamphlet about clicking gas cap from service representative after third repair visit)
Car alarm goes off randomly (attempted to repair twice, still is not repaired)
Air conditioner (twisted tube, water pouring onto passenger-side floor)
Replaced catalytic converter (dealer discovered it and replaced it without my asking)
Replaced entire muffler system
Squealing belts (oiled three times)

Repairs (owner):

Touch-up  paint chips/dings (too numerous to count).  The worst paint job that I have seen on any vehicle!
Stuck cable/pull on spare tire (oiled/graphite)
New brakes, pads, rotors (at 30,000 miles) � front brake dust is constant/excessive
Front end alignment
Oil changes every 3,000-5,000 miles


I am truly frightened as to what I'm in for when the odometer hits 36,000 and I am responsible for the cost of repairs.  And I'm not too happy that new owners get a 10year/100,000 mile warranty and those of us living the nightmare, get squat.  

Did I mention that I'm looking at Nissan Xterra's!
