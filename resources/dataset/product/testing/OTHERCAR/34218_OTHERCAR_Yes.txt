            It's great to see this car get posted ( Aug. 03) because I had the pleasure to take a 2004 Grand Prix on a 650 mile test drive in late June of 2003.

Enterprise Rent a Car had just stocked a 2004 Grand Prix, and categorized it as a Full Size car.  I drive a Bonneville, so I know what full size is, and this wasn't it.  But surprisingly, I did not feel crammed into it's driver seat.  However this is with the seat all the way back, and the steering wheel all the way up.  I couldn't pass up the chance to enjoy a brand new car with less than 500 miles on it so I took the Grand Prix for a grand tour.  I am guessing it was the standard Grand Prix because it did not specify any other letters after the name, and because it's a rental car.  My call to the Enterprise location prior to writing this review was met with one too many "huh?, what?" responses to continue inquiring.  So I am putting this under the generic Grand Prix heading. 

The Pontiac web site identifies the lowest priced Grand Prix as the GT-1, so maybe that's what it was.  I did notice right away that we were getting extended looks from almost anyone that was also in an older Grand Prix or Grand Am.  Very few folks have a 2004 out on the road, and if you are a fan of the model, it's understandable that a newer model would catch your eye.  This 2004 model was close enough to 2003 for me that I walked up to the wrong car in a parking lot at the beach, wondering why repeatedly pressing the keyless entry button was getting no response.  I was a couple cars off, and not paying attention because the body has changed for 2004.  They made the 2004's body more curvy, a bit more "muscle car" looking, and the fog lamps are far more pronounced.  The back appears to sit higher with a retooled rear reflector lights pattern.  The rear appears to sit higher due to the body's shape than actual height.  As a result, the rear windows are very small and high, probably up to the neck of a rear seat passenger.  I can't say that I know what that's like though, because no way I was going to scrunch into that back seat!  The back seat would be no prize for an average 6ft male if the front seats were in normal position.  With our seat back as far as it could go, the rear seat occupants would have to be from Cirque Du Soleil.  Perhaps this was the sacrifice when they designed the 60-40 (percent) split folding rear seat.  I had nothing to bulky enough to warrant using the folding seat configuration, but the trunk alone was very roomy for a car this size. 

We set out for the Maryland eastern shore from Northern New Jersey for a weekend.  I found the Grand Prix very easy to maneuver.  This is my first time with what Pontiac deemed it's "wide track" design.   The Bonneville has always been low and wide since it's major design change in 1992.  A few years ago, they decided to widen the Grand Am and the Grand Prix to appeal to those that want to capture that roadster feel and those customers that want more stability.  What the heck do I know, I don't work for Road and Track magazine.  The four wheel independent suspension felt like it was working it's magic.  Hard to be critical, because a brand new car is going to ride like a cloud more times than not.  

All I know is, being a big wide guy, after the seat and wheel adjustments, I slid into and out of the cockpit just fine.  Now, mind you, it's no Bonneville.  The space was there, but it was not cavernous.  It should be more than enough for the average sized person. I also noticed that this Grand Prix gave a tad more room for your right leg and foot to the right of the gas pedal.  So many cars have center consoles that widen out as they get under the dash, and the accelerator (gas) pedal is schooched over to the left a little too far for a comfortable extension of one's leg in long distance driving.  I had to adjust how I positioned my leg after years of driving my Bonneville brought on knee pains.  This Grand Prix allowed me to give my right leg easy pedal reach without buckling under and to the left.  Again, I don't want to wear out the fact that I'm a big guy, but this is a factor when I drive. 

This model Grand Prix had a CD player, and all the buttons and dials are easy to reach.  The headlight switch took a minute to get the hang of. It was located on the steering column, identical to, but on the opposite side of the turn signal stem.  It allows you to option the Daytime Running Lights, and the "Auto" feature that does that also cuts off your headlights automatically after you turn off the car.  The dashboard dials and MPH dial is bright and easy to read.   

Pontiac highlights the 3800 V6 engine.  A V-6 should be a given minimum on any thing higher than the most basic econo-buggy, so that's no big whoop, but they say the 3800 series 3 V6 is the largest in it's class.  I did feel a great response to some peppy footwork.  I am not the "jackrabbit start" type, but I did want to see how well it came out of the blocks when the light turned green.  Without being one of those morons that really blast off, I was able to get out ahead and over to another lane quite easily.  When you find yourself sandwiched between tractor-trailers on a highway, it's nice to have the jets available when you need to call on them.  Here's what the Pontiac web site says about the Grand Prix's ETC - "Electronic Throttle control", standard for 2004:

<b>"The only car in its class with this standard technology, speed-based ETC replaces the mechanical link between the accelerator pedal and throttle with electronic controls to provide immediate response. By tuning the throttle to 19 speed-based calibrations, this drive-by-wire system precisely modulates vehicle behavior for composure in parking lots and responsiveness on the highway."</b>

I knew there was something exceptional in it's quickness. Replaces the mechanical link between pedal and throttle with electronic controls, huh?  Loose translation: Don't take this baby to Moe at the corner garage who worked on your father's Dodge Dart.  No offense, but a generic repair lot strewn with assorted heaps is no place to take a 2004 car. 

As much as it pained me, I had to leave the music playing to my wife in the passenger seat!  No one should expect to change a CD in any dash player safely while driving.  The Stereo/AM-FM/CD player in this car had more buttons and dials than most full sized stereos.  When you drive out of your normal familiar radio stations' range, and are searching for new stations, have common sense and don't try to drive and tune. 

I don't know if air conditioning is that important a gradeable feature, but one of the reasons we rent for long distance summer car trips is that our eleven year old car's much fussed over AC puts out nothing!  The AC in the Grand Prix cooled the interior in minutes after baking in 90  degree heat.  We actually jumped in it to cool off midway through our day on the boardwalk in Ocean City MD.  

I recommend this car, based on how it drove as a brand spanking new vehicle.
