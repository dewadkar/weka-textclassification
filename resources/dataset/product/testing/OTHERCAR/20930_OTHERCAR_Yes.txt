             For several months I drooled over the ads for the PT Cruiser. I finally got to see one up close and personal.
 What a cute car! I love Chryslers as a rule but this car is nothing like my granny's.

I love the rounded front and the grill is much like the old 50's styling.  I did think it would be much bigger than what it really is. The adds of course made it look like the big &quot;boats&quot; from the 50's but in reality it's mid- sized at best. 

I have an old Chevy van that I use to haul all my equipment with and it gets approx 10 miles to the gallon so when the PT Cruiser came on the scene I thought well this might be THE  car for me. I looked one over and it certainly gets better gas mileage but even with the seats being out of the way I still couldn't fit my speakers into it so it wouldn't work out for business.

I'd still like one for hauling the kids around and just &quot;cruising&quot; around town. I just like the way it looks.
My husband looked at it and with the price being really reasonable $16,080.00 he offered to buy me one for our anniversary. The problem is there's a huge waiting list! I may have to wait 3 years for one! I really love the car but to wait 3 years to get it ? I may not love it then. I like instant gratification! I'd buy it right now if I could.<br><br>
