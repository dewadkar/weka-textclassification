            I just got my TT Quattro coupe (black on black) in June and love it. I read lots of reviews prior to buying it. Most complaints were about it's stiff ride and visibility. Well, it's a sports car. What did they expect? Everyone complements me on it, even in traffic.

A few things that I don't care for are mostly small design issues. The clutch pedal is too centered. It should be about 2-3 inches to the left. It's a bit hard shifting between 1st and 2nd. Kind of 'notchy' and I've been driving a stick for the past 22 years. The A/C vents don't point down enough. It would be nice to have a vent under the steering column at mid level. The cup holder is too far back, but I don't use it that much anyway. The six spoke rims on the 180hp can't go through a car wash, they will get scratched. I wish the seats had a quick release to tilt back instead of the turn knob. (Don't ask!)
