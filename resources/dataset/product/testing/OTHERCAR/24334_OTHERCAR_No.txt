             I have owned a 2000 Dakota for 3 months, the word for this truck is disappointment.  When we purchased the truck it had 4300 miles because it was a dealer demo.  We had looked at almost every new truck on the market, and chose this one due to the overall comfort and design of the truck. We found this one that had all the gadgets you could ever imagine, and at what we then thought was a great price.
 The cold hard truth about this little truck was quickly brought to our attention.  First of all, there was a whining noise coming from the front end.  Then, when you were traveling at a speed above 55mph and applied the brake the entire truck would shake. After repetitive trips back to the dealership they kept telling us that the warranty did not cover the brakes and that the whining noise was only my imagination. The truck now has 18,000 miles because my husband travels for work. Now, the transmission has decided that it doesn't want to work properly, it takes too long to change gears and then when it decides to change the transition is rough. 
About a week ago we decided that 3 months and 14,000 miles of nothing but trouble from this truck was enough, we tried to trade for a new F-250.  Were we ever in shock, the good price we paid turned out to be not so good after all.  We invested $24,000 into the truck and were told it is only worth $18,000, WOW!! The mileage is high I know, but this is insane, just as we feel we are after being stupid enough to purchase this truck.  All I can say is we were taken for a ride, and after this experience we will never own a Dodge of any kind again, and due to my dissatisfaction I am making it my main objective to tell everyone I know to &quot;Dodge&quot; the not so all-mighty DODGE.<br><br>
