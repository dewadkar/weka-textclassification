            This is my second VW (well, third if you count the '79 bus I had in high school) and is easily the best car I have ever owned.  It's good looking, rides like a dream, and gets 50MPG!  What's not to like?

I must say that VW dealers are not the most knowledgeable about the TDI, and will often try to convince buyers to look at gas-engine cars.  That's really a shame, considering the potential longevity and customer satisfaction.  Diesel engines have a reputation for living far longer than their gas-engine counterparts, and VW is known everywhere in the world (except the US) for its great diesel engines.  It's not unreasonable to expect to get over 250,000 miles from this car.

It takes a little time to adjust to driving a TDI.  The tourque band is in the low-RPM range, so you want to shift early to take advantage of the engine.  The engine is rated at only 90 HP, but it outperforms VW's 2.0 liter gas engine (115 HP) due to much higher torque.  You can also buy a tremendous performance upgrade in the form of a modified engine control chip for about $550 that will give the car more than enough power for most drivers.  For more info on the chip, go to www.chip-tuning.com. 

The interior of the car is very well laid-out.  Its seats may seem a little too firm during a short test-drive, but you'll be grateful for them on a long trip.  I drove from Detroit to Bangor, ME last summer and was very thankful for the support the seats provided.  I'm also 6'4&quot; and have trouble fitting into many smaller cars.  With the Jetta, I don't even have to put the seat all the way back!  This is a first for any size car!  Of course, I don't leave a lot of room in the back that way.  The car is very comfortable for two people on extended trips, but I wouldn't want to ride in the back seat for very long.  Kids shouldn't have any trouble though.

I originally bought this car because I had to commute 130 miles a day and wanted to save money on gas.  If you're in a similar situation, I doubt you will find a better commuter car.  Remember also that the same engine is sold in the VW Golf and New Beetle.  Buy whichever one suits your needs/style, but don't settle for anything less than the TDI engine.  You'll be glad you did.

One more thing:  if you're interested in finding out more about the TDI, go to www.tdiclub.com  It's the best source of information about these cars anywhere.
