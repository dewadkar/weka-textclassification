            The Isuzu Rodeo is an excellent choice for the cost-conscious consumer.  The vehicle is sound both inside and out and offers the owner many options.  I have had a 98 Rodeo since December 98 and have had little problems with it.  The ABS system sensor has been replaced and the fan and pulley have been replaced at 38000 miles.  I have driven the vehicle hard and tested its limits, and it has proven time and again it is in a class by itself.  I purchased the vehicle new for under 22,000.00.  I would ask anyone considering buying this vehicle to negotiate with their Isuzu dealer, the few I have been to are extremely helpful and will do whatever it takes to make a sale.

Finally, when considering this vehicle and others like it keep in mind that Isuzu manufactures the Rodeo for Honda (they market the vehicle as the passport, and Honda makes the Odyssey minivan for Isuzu).  When comparing the vehicles, the most noticeable difference was the 3000.00-5000.00 price increase in the Passport.<br><br>
