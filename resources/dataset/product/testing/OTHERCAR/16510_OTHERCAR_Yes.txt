            First of all, I'm not the typical Cabrio driver.  I'm not a teenage Beverly Hills girl.  I'm a 19 year old male college student.  I bought my '98 black with a beige top Cabrio brand new in June of '98.  Ever since I have found every excuse of a decent (not necessarily warm) day to put the top down.

When I was in the market for a new car in May of '98, I decided that I was going to get the convertible that I've always wanted.  And, having owned two Volkswagens before, there wasn't even a question as to what brand I was going to buy.  However, my dad wouldn't let me just go to the local VW dealer and order my car, I had to shop around for other brands to get a feel for the cars and to make an informed decision.  I agreed.  So, I went to the local Chevrolet dealer to test drive a Cavalier Z24 Convertible.  First of all, the dealer didn't have any stick shifts to let me drive so I was disappointed from the start.  Secondly, this was during GM's strike so I might have to wait for my car to come in.  Thirdly, and most importantly, the car drove horribly.  It wasn't put together as well as the Cabrio, it wasn't as quiet as the Cabrio, and it didn't feel as solid as the Cabrio.  About the only advantages it had over the Cabrio were the power windows, cruise control, power top, and abs it came with standard that were all options on the Cabrio.  Even these pros weren't enough to sway my opinion.

On to the Toyota dealer to test drive a Celica GT Convertible.   After driving this car I thought that I might have actually been convinced to buy something other than a Volkswagen.  It was a stick, was quiet inside with the top up, was put together with excellent build quality, and had an impressive warranty, not to mention all the standard features at about the same price.  However, even this couldn't change my mind, it seemed a little too grown up for me, an 18 year old college student.  On to the VW dealer to look at the car I knew that I would get.

I got to the dealer and was greeted immediately by a salesperson.  Nothing unfamiliar to those that are in the market for a new car.  However he wasn't pushy or annoying.  He was just there to help, and help he did, get a great deal that is.  I test drove a red Cabrio GLS 5-speed.  It was great!!  However, I decided that I didn't want a leather interior or a power top since you still have to get out of the car to put the boot cover on.  So, I had to get a GL.  No big deal, I could get almost all of the GLSs standard features as options on the GL, except one thing, ABS.  Uh oh, something that I didn't like about the cabrio.  Oh well, I could live without it.  So, I decided to get a 5-speed GL in black with a beige top.  I wanted power windows, cruise control, and alloy wheels, all of which I got.  I also got heated seats and side airbags.  After all dealing was said and done, I ended up paying only $18,435 for my car and I even got floor mats.  Now, I don't know if this was because I was paying cash for my car or because these cars were the last few produced before the new models were going to be made.  Anyway, it was a deal and a half so I took it.  They said that they would look around for the car I was looking for (since the current Cabrios were no longer being produced, I couldn't order one from the factory) and would call me if they found one.

Two weeks went by and I received a phone call from my salesman.  They were able to find the car I wanted and it was ready for me to pick up.  So, I was immediately on my way with my dad to the dealer.  Once there, I signed some papers and then was handed the keys.  At last it was mine!!

Now, after almost two years, I still love the car.  I've had not one problem with it and it looks as good as the day I got it.  Although that has a lot to do with the excellent care I take of it.  I love everything about the car and hate nothing.  What I love most other than the car itself is the family you join when you own a VW, it's like no other.  Driving the car is so effort free it's rediculous.  For a 5-speed it couldn't get easier.  It doesn't take a very skillful person to be able to drive the Cabrio smoothly.  It handles great, stops great, and looks great top up or down.  I can't say enough about how this car has impressed me everyday that I drive it.  It impressed me so much that I convinced my girlfriend to get one also.  She just got her Desert Wind Cabrio GLS in September '99 and she can't say enough about it!

As to who should buy this car, EVERYONE!!!!!!!  There's no reason why someone should not buy this car.  It has everything that you could want in a new or used convertible and more.  The only thing that I think it is lacking is more power.  But, I've taken care of this with some performance add-ons since I'm also a frequent VW show goer.  But, even stock, the power is more than adequate for the normal driver, making quick work of semis on the highway.

If you have any questions for me about my Cabrio or VWs in general, email me at wdc119@psu.edu<br><br>
