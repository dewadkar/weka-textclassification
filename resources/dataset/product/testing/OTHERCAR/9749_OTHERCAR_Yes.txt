            I'll get one thing out of the way.  I bought this camera mainly because it looked cool.  I was shopping for a digital camera in an electronics market (I live in Asia) and was looking for something in the 2.0 megapixel range.  I ran across the CoolPix 2500 and the design of it definitely caught my eye.  I looked at it for a while, toyed around and decided I wanted to buy it.  While it's definitely a good camera, it's not the best.

On the whole, I thought this camera was pretty good.  One thing that sets the Nikon CoolPix line of cameras apart from everything else is its swivel lens design.  This is clever because when you're not using it, it covers the lens.  No need to worry about broken lens covers or scratched lenses anymore.  Plus it helps getting angled shots much easier.  No more craning your neck to get a shot above of below you, just tilt the lens.  It's a whole lot more useful than you'd think.

The picture quality of this in general is pretty good.  The colors come out accurately and the pictures are clear.  However, the night exposure could be better, although it's good enough to pass without any qualms.  A big problem that's related to night time shots however is red eye.  It's always there and it never seems to go away.  I managed to minimize it using the different scene settings, but it just never completely leaves.  It gets sort of annoying after a while, but it's something most people can live with.

Also, the camera tends to feel on the fragile side.  Whenever I put it in my pocket, I always feel like it's going to break any second.  Of course it's never happened and I realize that it'll take quite a bit to knock it out of commission, but it does have that light easily breakable feeling that I can never seem to shrug off.

Some other minor complaints is that there is no video output straight to a TV and there is no optical viewfinder, although the optical viewfinder part isn't really too big of a problem.  Also, there is no protection for the LCD screen.  Something along the lines of what Sony does with their cameras would have been a good protective measure to take with the screen.

With all these negative aspects to it, you would think that I wouldn't like it, but that isn't the case.  It still is a good camera and it's a blast to use.  The visual quality is still fairly good and has a bunch of nifty features to it, namely the swivel lens.  And besides, whenever you pull it out in front of other people and you swing the lens, everyone will go "ooohhhhhh."
