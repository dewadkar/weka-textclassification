            I leased a new VW Golf 2.0 4 door in March of 2000. This review is for the 2000 model.

I have since sold my Golf, but it was without doubt the best car I have ever owned. US manufacturers simply do not seem able to compete with the styling and quality of new VWs, and Japanese competitors produce products that are bland by comparison. Even though the list price of the Golf is a little higher than the domestic and Japanese competition, it comes loaded with options, and holds its value extremely well.

Plastics are of the highest quality, the instrument panel is beautifully designed, and lit at night with a blue glow. The GLS model comes with all the options anyone needs, and even the GL model has ABS, remote locking and a great stereo as standard.

Handling is safe and predictable, but not sporty. Ride quality is excellent, and I was able to put in several 600 mile trips without feeling tired or uncomfortable.

All of these advantages become doubly clear when it comes time to sell your Golf. VW seems to have shed its reputation from the 1980s for poor quality and reliability, and I was able to sell mine after 18 months of use for not much less than the new price.

My complaints are few and far between. The 2.0 gas engine model is not fast, particularly if you go for the automatic. On reflection, and after driving a Beetle with the 1.8 engine, I'd be inclined to go for a GTI 1.8 next time, particularly now that it comes with 180 hp.

Gas mileage is only average. I had two very minor electrical problems, one with an intermittently flickering airbag warning light, the other with the remote locking not always activating the alarm.

If you are considering a compact car, the Golf is, in my mind, by far the best choice.
