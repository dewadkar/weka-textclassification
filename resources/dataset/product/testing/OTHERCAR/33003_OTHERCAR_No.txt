            Last summer I purchased a new 1999 GMC Sierra SLT extended cab. The truck seemed extremely appealing to me at the dealership. It had a new stylish exterior, lavish leather interior and a new V-8 engine that boasted higher horsepower and more torque for towing. The addition of the third door was a high selling point as well. One year later, I have accumulated 15,000 miles. I now feel that I have become qualified to write an honest review of this vehicle. 

Pros:
   First starting off with the exterior. The paint has held up extremely well in the intense Florida heat. It has been very resilient to scratches and fading. GMC's use of chrome accents and two-tone paint gives this vehicle an attractive appearance. The rear cargo bed is very large and deep, with the ability to hold almost an endless supply of cargo. The interior is very spacious and the seats give terrific support. The back seat gives the kind of leg room that you would only see in a crew cab. The seat easily folds up for storage of large items. The dash is well laid out and places the air and radio controls at an angle toward the driver's reach. The rearview mirror safely dims when bright lights encounter it. It also includes a built in compass that has proven to be handy on road trips.

Cons:
   On the exterior, the side mirror chrome has become unglued and create excessive wind noise. Also, the front bumper cover is experiencing the same thing. The GMC factory bedliner used double sided tape to hold the liner to the surface of the bed. The tape has become worn and the pieces flap around while driving. The interior has become a plethora of annoyances. The doors automatically lock at 15 miles an hour and only can be unlocked manually. The rear view mirror is located near the middle of the windshield, making it very hard to see out of the right front side of the truck. The rear push out windows create an excessive amount of wind noise at highway speeds. The seat belts use a hole in the seat bottom that becomes torn and unsightly due to regular use. The entire interior is filled with squeaks and rattles. The doors must be shut very hard in order to get them to close properly. The transmission and differential seem loose and bumpy, constantly thumping during downshifts. The engine stutters and stalls during cold start mode for about the first 5 miles of driving (so far, a un-fixable problem). 

Service:
   Service has always been an issue with me about GMC products. This is the third GMC truck that I have owned in the past 9 years. The service departments seem too eager to pass something off as a un-fixable defect or simply that they all do that. The stalling problem has required multiple service visits and thousands of warranty dollars on diagnosing this problem. The stalling has still been unsolved. 

Who should buy this vehicle?
   An absolute truck lover. Someone that is in definite need of a truck to use for hauling and towing. A person that is not going to be bothered by squeaks and rattles, they're driving a TRUCK.
