            Being a 22 year old red blooded American male, the first thing people ask me when they see my car is, &quot;A station wagon?  Are you trying to pick up soccer moms?&quot;  Ha ha, very funny, but I love my Avant!  I have a 1999.5 A4 2.8 Avant Quattro with a Tiptronic transmission, and I have never had so much fun driving a car in my life!

It can never be said that the A4 (even the six cylinder 2.8) is a fast car, especially with the automatic transmission, but the engine has fistfulls of torque from idle almost all the way up to the redline, which makes the car seem much faster than it actually is.  And the quattro system lets you abuse the fat and flat torque curve in ways that the laws of physics should not allow.  You can toss the car around on twisty roads, and as long as you are on the gas, the car STICKS to the asphalt.  The AWD system does take some getting used to at first, however, and you will notice a pronounced (and scary) understeer if you lift of the throttle in the middle of a curve.  The steering is tight and precise (except for the before mentioned phantom understeer).

The biggest drawbacks of the car are rear room and driver ergonomics.  The back seat is cramped, and the space inbetween the doorframe and the bench is very narrow, making entering and exiting somewhat of an acrobatic feat.  But keep in mind that this car has very very petite exterior dimensions:  you can squeeze this car into all but the very smallest of parking spaces.

This brings me to the second drawback of the car--ergonomics.  The buttons on the center console are completely homogenous, so the driver must remove his eyes from the road in order to make any adjustments to the stereo or climate control.  Some of the controls, especially the cruise control, are awkwardly placed.  The window controls on the driver's side door are also placed in a hard to reach place.  You might hear from people that the headlight switch is difficult to use...I don't understand what people are thinking when they say this.  After using it once, you will realize that it is vastly superior to any other solution available.

These mistakes in the design team's judgement, however, do not effect the overall experience of this car, which is overwhelmingly positive.  I had always thought that the voracious loyalty of Audi owners had more to do with an underdog complex (to BMW 3 Series owners), but after owning both cars, I can say without a moment's hesitation that the A4 more than worthy enough to be mentioned in the same breath as the legendary 3 Series.

The seats are somewhat firm, which makes them somewhat uncomfortable for trips over 2 hours, but they are supportive and reasonably comfortable.  As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, be careful about the dealership that the car is purchased from.  Some are very responsive and redefine the principle of customer support.  Some could care less about you as soon as you fork over your hard earned cash.  If you are in the Western Pennsylvania area, The Sewickly Car Store comes highly recommended (they also sell BMWs, which is helpful, since these are the top 2 choices in the ~30k luxury market).  The warranty is short (3 years, 50k), but I have had no problems to speak of with my car, even after putting on 20k miles in the first 3 months of ownership.

The Avant option is more realistically a choice for those who are sports oriented rather than those looking to haul cargo.  Unfortunately, the back seats do not fold down flat, and the passenger's seat is incapable of folding down completely forward, which limits maximum cargo area.  But there is more than enough room for hockey or ski equipment.  I have not found a better automobile for a combination of splitting city and leisure time.  Although there is some stigma involved with owning a station wagon, I personally think that it looks beautiful, and even better than the sedan version of the A4.  The lines are sleek and squat, which gives the car a very clean, powerful look.

Skip the audio package:  the bass is punchy and tightly ranged.  I would also skip the sports package unless you live in a snow free environment (or if you want to rotate to snow tires during the winter), since the tires that come with the sports package are not 4season.  The sports steering wheel is definitely a guilty pleasure that I would recommend if you opt against the sports package--it fits your hands perfectly, and the wheel mounted Tiptronic switches make you feel like an F1 driver.

Looking at the sales figures, I don't think that I need to tell anyone in the market for a small sports sedan to at least give the Audi a chance.  I think that the final decision between the Audi and BMW is not one of quantitative properties, but rather qualitative ones.  The two cars are so equally matched, and are so nearly perfect, that the decision will almost undoubtedly come down to the personality of the two cars.  Either way, you can't go wrong.  The Audi just fit me better.<br><br>
