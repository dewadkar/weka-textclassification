            I bought one of the very first &quot;Geo&quot; Chevrolet Prism, I have the hatchback
model, which is wonderful for moving larger objects that would not normally fit in the trunk of a &quot;normal&quot; car.  I love my Prism, and I highly recommend that anyone looking for a dependable economic car look at the Prism.  The engine on the older model is a Toyota made engine giving it that loved dependability that you associate with &quot;Toyota&quot;.  It is assembled within the United States in Fremont California, making the parts affordable and available when needed.  If you are looking for a new or a used car I would recommend you look at your nearest Chevrolet dealer.  My gas mileage is great, I still get 33 mpg even after 11 years.  The original model featured some of those great features seen still on newer Geos, the half roll down windows in the backseat and child safety locks.  I enjoy the four door ease, and the small car all rolled into one.<br><br>
