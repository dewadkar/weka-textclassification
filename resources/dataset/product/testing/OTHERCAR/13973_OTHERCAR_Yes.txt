            After a week in Toyota's newest version of the MR2 I still found myself wanting to put the top down and find a twisty two lane road. The multi valve 4 cylinder engine can move the MR2 to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds more power would be ok, more exhaust sound would be much better. Handling is great, the new electronic steering is dead on with great feedback. The ride is sports car firm but won't kill your kidneys. Where the Spyder falls short is storage two small bins behind the seats a small bin under the front hood and a small glove box and center storage bin in the dash. This is not a car for those who don't know how to pack light or play golf. And why 3 cup holders for a 2 seater? The top operation couldn't be easier two latches and push and no boot to fuss with and a glass rear window for winter-yes people do drive sports cars in the winter. For $23,000 this may be one of the best values in the top goes down sports car class.<br><br>
