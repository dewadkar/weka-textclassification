            When I bought my 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee, it was not done on impulse. I knew what I could expect from this usually rugged SUV. I enjoyed the V8 engine power and the functional design, which allows drivers to see up over the crowd while maintaining extreme comfort from the ergonomic, power seating.

In fact, I was in love with my Jeep, even though it showed no respect for my wallet at the gas pump (11-13 mpg!!). I had a relatively carefree ride for the first year and a half of ownership. The first PROBLEM was an electrical wiring malfunction that caused the remote locking system to fail--this was a continuing issue. Then, I started to burn through batteries like they were candy. I had to replace the original battery 4 times, until a mechanic suggested that I disable the electrical security system--which had been identified as a power drain in some models, according to him. There were also a few little quirky things (like warning messages coming on for no reason) within the instrument panel digital displays.

Needless to say, I followed all of the regular maintenance schedules; but by the fourth year of ownership, a lot of things began to breakdown. The tires also wore badly, even though I had them rotated regularly and drove with appropriate levels of air in them. I ended up replacing the water pump, tires (all 4), starter, and the interior rearview mirror, which would not stay attached to the window.

In the end, my Jeep was a disappointment, as I only got 100,000 miles from it, when I expected at least 120,000 and I paid premium dollar for the car.  <br><br>
