            I bought a honda civic because I heard that they are very reliable and have good resale value. I know some people that own civics and other honda models that were very happy with their vehicles. I have had so many problems with the american car makers and their service, not to mention their poor resale value, that I just wanted to make a switch to something else. It turned out to be the best decision that I ever made. I have had absolutely no trouble out of my civic. I just changed out the brake pads at 50000 miles. The rotors had to be turned but were still in good shape. The car handles great, rides great, and is very stable on the road. If you have ever driven an american compact you will really appreciate the solid handling of the civic. The civic is well worth the extra money. You will get your money back plus some compared to an american compact. You will also be driving a much better  handling and reliable vehicle in the mean time. Just look in the paper and some online sellers and see how much more the civic sells for after 3-5 years compared to an american compact. I would highly recommend anyone with a child in college to buy them a civic. It will last through college with no problems and they can drive it a few years until they can afford something that they deem to be stylish. Practical is the way to go when you are in school. The civic gets almost 40 miles to the gallon with the stick shifter. I would recommend buying a stick because it lasts 3 times longer than an automatic and gets better gas mileage. No matter what car you buy, an automatic will not last much more than 130,000 miles without some problems. I have heard of civic manual transmissions lasting 500,000 miles or more.<br><br>
