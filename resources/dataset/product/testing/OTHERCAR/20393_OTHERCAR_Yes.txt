            I purchased a Volkswagen Golf GLS 1.8T this January and it has exceeded my expectations. I compared this model with the Honda Civic EX, Toyota Corolla, and Saturn SL and concluded that the Golf was far superior. Although I intended to buy the standard 2.0L gasoline engine, the turbo engine was offered at a price I couldn't refuse.

<B>Essential Features</B>
ABS Brakes
Believe me, the brakes stop the car in a heart beat. It's almost too good the first time you try it. In addition, all VWs have four wheel disc brakes and not the inferior drum brakes found in the rear wheels of many other cars. The driver must be careful because the Golf's brakes are so light and effective.

Daytime Running Lights
These were proven by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety to reduce accident claims and injuries. These operate at low power during the day and switch to full power if the driver turns on the interior dash lights.

Front, Side, Head Air Bags
Now standard on all VWs, head protection air bags were proven by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety to be essential in limiting fatal injuries in a side intrusion collision. Side air bags on VWs deploy from the seat ensuring that protection will follow the passengers wherever their seat may be positioned.

Head Rests and 3 Point Seat Belts
These are found at all five seating positions. Every passenger should have a height adjustable head restraint and three point seat belts. Anything less is compromising on safety.

<B>Nice Features</B>
High Quality Workmanship
The dash panels are in perfect fit. The door panels are in perfect fit. The cool blue lights in the dash look wonderful. Although the car is assembled in Brazil, the workmanship far exceeds any other car I looked at.

Remote Keyless Entry/Alarm
Every VW comes with a special folding key that is shaped to make it almost impossible to copy. On top of that, the key has a microship imbedded inside of it that electronically starts the ignition making it even harder to copy. On top of that, every VW has an alarm with keyless entry standard. The alarm will sound if any door or window is opened, or if the car is lifted.

Eight Speaker Stereo
Every Golf comes with an excellent sound system as a standard feature. The optional Monsoon Audio Upgrade seems almost overkill. (None of the Golfs come with CD players however.)

Full Sized Spare Tire
Yes, every VW has a full sized spare. If I ever see another stupid temporary spare tire I'm going to puke.

Turbo Engine
The 150hp engine is light and fast. The accelerator is also light and very sensitive. Although you must use premium unleaded gasoline, you get the same gas mileage as the standard 115hp engine. I would never put anything less than premium gasoline in my cars anyway.

<B>Thoughtful Features</B>
Hood and Hatch Lift on Gas Struts
Both the engine hood and the rear hatch lift on gas struts which don't need any extra work to hold up. I especially like that the hood doesn't require you to use a skinny prop up bar.

Driver Window Controls
These controls have both auto-down and auto-up for both front windows. What's the purpose of one touch down if you have to hold the control to raise the window back up? The windows also have pinch protection sensors.

Autolocking Doors
All VWs lock the doors when your car goes over 5 mph. This feature is a marvelous safety enhancement. If passengers insist on opening a locked door, they still can from the inside but not the outside.

Useful Hatch Area
The cargo area can be expanded by folding the rear seats down flat. The area has four cargo tie downs, a power outlet, and a compartment for a medical kit and CD-changer.
Another advantage of the Golf over the Jetta is that your hatch has a rear windshield wiper.

<B>A Few Gripes</B>
No car is perfect, so here are some of my gripes. I wish that it had a CD player standard (or that installing one wasn't $600). I wish that I didn't have to have the upgraded velour cloth seats. They feel nice but attracts hair and lint, unlike the much nicer "standard" cloth seats. One last thing is that I still don't trust my cupholders because they dangle your drinks in front of the stereo. I keep thinking my Pepsi will drip condensation onto the control knobs.
