            Everyone is going crazy about Honda, they are even on the top of the cars being stolen each year.  Honda really makes cars with mark of quality, but are they really that great?  No, as I drove a Honda Accord, I can't say it is worth the money.  With over $20,000 invested into this Accord, I think Honda Civic is a way better choice unless you are really used to the size of an Accord.  

Accord is not all that luxurious but it gives teh power and reliability that can only compare with Lexus and Infinity.  Power door locks and power windows as well as controls are located conveniently and are a pleasure to use.  Honda is a great car to take for long trips, seats are comfortable: front and rear.

It's a great car overall but if you are looking to spend less money go for a Civic, it's just as zippy as Accord, just not as roomy. <br><br>
