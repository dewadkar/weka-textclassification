            I bought my 1995 Villager used about 2 years ago.  I actually traded in a 1993 Villager. If I'm on my second one you can tell how much I like this van. Prior to these two Villagers I had the displeasure of owning a 1990 Plymouth Voyager.  The Villager is far better than the Voyager.

I remember the day we moved into our house.  It was raining pitchforks.  We had planned our move for my husband's light truck.  This wasn't too wise in the rain.  The Villager came through.  With the flexibility of removing the middle seat and sliding the rear one forward we were actually able to fit all the furniture from my son's bedroom in the back of the van--and, everything stayed dry.

On a somewhat negative side, I'm not sure how well the Villager holds its value.  Several months ago it appeared the market had been flooded with vans and the value seemed to decrease tremendously.  I haven't inquired lately about trading so I don't know the current situation.  One reason I have not checked into trading lately is because I can't think of what I want that will give me all the roominess and comfort required by our family of four.

This is a great van!<br><br>
