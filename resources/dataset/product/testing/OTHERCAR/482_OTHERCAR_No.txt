            A drove a 1998 Celica with a 5 speed stick a while back when I was looking for a unique car to use for short summer runs.  I saw the black-on-black 5 speed with all options at a local dealer, and it was a certified vehicle carrying a warranty.  First off, the dealer was very pushy in trying to get me into a new Sequoia and other high profit vehicles.

I did manage to get the car out for a ride, alone.  It shifted almost as well as my S70 T5, but the interior is even more cramped than a Geo/Chevy Metro.  The interior was up to Toyota quality fit and finish and looked relatively attractive and extremely clean for a used car.  The ergonomics were excellent, although the same cannot be said for the comfort, visibility or room.

The car's engine does not seem to match what Toyota makes the car out to be.  Mine had the uplevel 2.2L 4-cylinder, and it was able to move the light car along fairly well, although not as fast as some newer, cheaper cars.  This is not a real stoplight racer, although it is possible.  The car sure is an attention getter, in almost all the colors.  But most of the attention is probably from the guys in the white and black cars -- luckily, the engine won't make these people too mad.

The price?  $16,900.  High?  Very.  Why would somebody buy a used car for $16,900?  If you buy a Toyota, you will pay more for what may well be an excellent car.  This is not a car for teens, as it is classified as a sports car, and on top of initial cost, insurance premiums are over the top.  My advice?  If you are looking for a sports car, get a late model Z28/Firehawk from Chevy/Pontiac.  With the ax officially down on the Camaro, it is probably a somewhat safe investment.  Plus, can anyone resist the sound of an American v8?
