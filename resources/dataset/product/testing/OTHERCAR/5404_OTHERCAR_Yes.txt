              I recently obtained a Canon Powershot A50 for approximately $350. The first thing I noticed is that it came with a non-rechargeable NiCad battery and no charger. I realize that you can get a NiMh battery at buy.com for about 23 dollars, and a charger for a bit more, but its no good to sell a nice digital camera without a rechargeable battery.

  Battery problems aside, it was a great camera. It has very good image quality, a good zoom, and its in an incredibly compact package. The 1.3 megapixel resolution produces sharp and stunning pictures. The camera has an incredibly crisp LCD screen that displays the pictures in great detail for reviewal of pictures in memory.

  The camera comes with its own software for downloading pictures from the camera via a cable connecting to the serial port. I found the software and cable very easy to use, but very slow. This is a common problem with digital cameras.  Once the images are retrieved, you can save them as jpeg format images, and from there you can import them into any program you like. I suggest you go out and buy a compactflash card reader because they are far quicker than the camera.

  The camera itself has many great features including picture stitching. You can use this feature to make very wide pictures using many smaller ones and sticking them together. The camera also comes with an NTSC Television output for presentation purposes.

  All of this comes in a very great package.  The camera is very light and durable. The case feels very sturdy, and can be taken with you wherever you go. It really amazes me that all of this can be so compact.

  When experimenting with it, I took some pictures inside, and outside. The camera did great with low light situations as well as in very bright situations.

  I would recommend that if you get this camera, get the NiMH battery, charger, and compact flash reader for your computer. These are almost required for your enjoyment of the camera.

  Overall, its a great camera that should come with more accessories.<br><br>
