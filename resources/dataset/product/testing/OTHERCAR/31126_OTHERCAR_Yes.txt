            This care is a exceptional handling and riding car.  Its performance  is quick, quite and stable.  Its great around town and fantastic on the highway.

Acceleration is great, gets right with the program much faster then our Turbo Volvo.  In the mountains  west of Denver it has  plenty of power to go up the hills at any speed.

We can travel 1,000 miles a long day in this vehicle for instance going from Denver to Chicago.  No we don't stop and smell the roses, done that.  About twice a  year  we go from Denver to St. Louis in one day where our son goes to school.  Approximately 12.5 hours.  We make very limited stops.  It has  the range to make this in one stop at about Salina Kansas. 

 It get 25 mpg going 70-80.  It will easily accelerate to  pass.

It now has 65,000 miles on it and it is still going great.  

This is our third BMW all  have been good and it is the best for our purposes.  

A competent shop is needed to do maintenance, they are real complex,  some would say over engineered, in the truest sense of the word.  They are complex and seldom need repair, but when they do you  should know a shop that is honest, competent and  less expensive.  We seldom have taken ours to the dealer.  There is a Ferrari Dealer that does our work and they are great and less expensive.  Go Figure?

It is not a track car and I will no auto cross it.  Even so its handling is on par with a much smaller car.   We have added the M parallel wheels with Michelin tires and they have be exceptional.  With the Michelin X Green tires (stock on the basket weave wheels) we got about 30,000 miles.  We always use premium fuel as recommended.  

Its a big car, and one can say that a smaller car would be easier to handle around town.  After a tiring day at the office, it is nice to get into a great car and drive home.
