            I needed a dependable car to get to and from school everyday.  After careful consideration, my family and I decided to lease a Toyota Corolla LE.  That was almost two years ago, and I haven't had a single regret.
The Corolla is the perfect size for me (a 5'4&quot; female with no children to lug around), but I can see how a bigger person with people to cart around may not have enough room. 
For a small car, the Corolla has a lot of power and pickup and is quite dependable in slick weather.  It also has a roomy trunk and the back seats fold down if you need to transport larger items.  
This car gets wonderful mileage.  I get about 30 miles to the gallon!!
It has automatic door lock and a great feature of locking all the doors once you start the car-just so you don't forget-as well as opening them all when you shut the car and are ready to get out.  
The radio and air conditioning work very well and have never had to be repaired.  
It is a wonderful experience to drive this car.  It is very quiet and sometimes I have to check that it is really even on!  It is very responsive and I've never had a single problem with it.  I truly don't have one bad thing to say about it!!  I recommend it to anyone looking for a compact car to get around in.<br><br>
