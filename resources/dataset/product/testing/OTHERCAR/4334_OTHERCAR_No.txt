            The first impression on seeing the defender is awesome looking. Test drove a used 1997 at a dealers Feb 13, 2001. Low mileage and well taken care of, but rust in door handles was already evident, it was for sale in NY State.

I'm 6'3" with fairly long legs and found the seating position far to cramped for me, and the seat was not supportive for my height. The visibility over the front hood was very good, the inside heat and ventilation controls took some getting used to, but they added to the character of the Defender.

The A/C unit leaves almost no knee room for the passenger, but then I don't normally sit there. I found it annoying that there was absolutely no place to rest my left elbow during driving, which would make longer trips uncomfortable.

The wind noise of the convertible I test drove was very loud indeed. Overall I found the Defender 90 to be uncomfortable and expensive, at a asking price of $41,000.

I have owned Jeep Wranglers and TJ's in the past and was looking for something with a bit more character, the Defender certainly has the character, but the negatives outweighted any positives for me.

Perhaps as an off-road vehicle it would perform wonderfully, but it certainly lacked any attributes for city or highway driving.

I sincerely was hoping that I would like it more. Thank you for reading this.
