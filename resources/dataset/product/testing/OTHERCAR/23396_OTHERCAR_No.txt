            I owned a 1985 Saab 900 Turbo, 5-speed, black w/tan leather interior a few years back(1988-1990). It had 40,000 miles on it when I bought it and 90,000 when I traded it in.

I loved driving it but the truth is my mechanic got to drive it more than I did.  I purchased it for $ 11,650 in 1988 from a dealer, and must have put another five to six thousand into it in repairs. 

When I was informed that the wiring harnesses were about to go(at $1500 each just for parts, it was time to say goodbye.

The steering is very accurate and natural, the power very good on the turbo version, and handling strong as well. As  Brakes are more than adequate. As has been correctly pointed out by many, this is one of the safer cars around. The fact that Saab started out making jets, as can be seen in their earlier designs, and even in the aerodynamic  example I owned, gives you an idea that this is a technology driven company. Saabs have more individuality, from the placement of the ignition, to the love-it or hate-it exterior, than most cars.  The seats are very comfortable and very, very supportive. The leather used was first rate.  the car just feels right.

If the repairs had been less costly and less frequent, I would probably give this car my wholehearted approval.
Maybe I was just unfortunate, but then again around the time I owned mine, my boss purchased a brand new 1989 Saab 9000 and had to replace the transmission within the first six months! (Hey who told him to buy an automatic?) 

If you like Saabs, it may actually be cheaper to buy one made since a certain large American manufacturer bought them out. Then you can have your Saab - and drive it too.
