            I had been reading reports on the NEON and became interested in the &quot;new&quot; Neon. The Neon has evolved much from the earlier models into a larger more comfortable car but maintaining the Neon &quot;friendly look&quot;.

I drive it daily on the infamous LBJ (I635)and its 10 lanes of traffic. The power is more than sufficient to keep up with traffic that often hits 80 MPH. The fit and finish is very nice. Gas mileage at 27 mpg (observed), under these driving conditions,is great.

The only 2 questions I have for Daimler-Chrysler is why a 3 speed automatic instead of a 4? Why power windows in the front only. Actually I can understand not having buttons in the back but the transmission is a strange decision. Thankfully, little is lost in performance.

This is an excellent commuter car or small family car. A student off to college could benefit with the economy, car price, and available space.

Buy it today! 5 stars out of 5.<br><br>
