            We sunk my wife's first college car, a '74 VW Beetle in a pool of water outside Union Station in St. Louis.  It was one of those freak midwestern thunderstorms that dumps rain on the car faster than the windshield wipers can remove it.  My wife's shoes floated away during the sinking, and we ended up buying new shoes and and stiff drinks inside the station.  After a half hour the water was gone, leaving her poor car washed up on the curb like a u-boat on an sand bar.  With a little coaxing, it spit a gallon or two of water out of the muffler and started right up.

When we looked for a car to replace her GraduateMobile, we researched thoroughly the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, mentally blocking out any notion of buying a VW.  She was graduating, after all.  VW's are college cars, right?

On a whim, we stopped by the VW dealer and checked out the Passat.  The car's styling and handling were so unlike the Accord's and Camry's that we were sold on the spot.  I like the external look of the Passat - an aerodynamic bubble on top of a muscular frame, while my wife likes the interior styling - tan leather contrasting with black instruments and dash.  The car's handling is much tighter than the Accord and Camry, but retains the smoothness you'd expect from a decent sedan.

The leather seats seemed stiff at first, but were extraordinarily comfortable even on the 3 hour trips I've had to take lately.  My wife and I are both small people, and I did tend to slide around in the drivers seat when we first bought the car, but I think I've dented it sufficiently that the seat grips me quite well now.

If you do buy the car, make sure you drive both the 4 and 6 cylinder versions.  We bought the 4 because we're primarily using the car for fuel-efficient commuting, but I have friends who feel the 6 gave the car a more powerful feel.  The tiptronic transmission works wonderfully, especially if you let the engine sing out at 4 1/2 or 5 krpms before shifting.

The instrument panel took a little getting used to - the blue light that illuminates the dash is a little stunning at first.  Not exactly what you want when you're driving at night.  After a few nights of use, I found that it was actually a little easier to glance back and forth between the road and the instruments than in my previous car (an '86 Camry).

The trunk is very roomy, and doesn't have any hinges that extend into the trunk space when it is closed.  The 60/40 rear seat comes down easily and doesn't leave a large trench in which to lose objects when the seats are down.

My _only_ complaint about the car is the flimsy, poorly placed, small cup holders that fold out of the dash too close to the shifter knob.  None of the plastic 20oz bottles (and many of the 12oz ones as well) won't fit in the holders.  I drink primarily from little coffee cups and cans now.
