            Having owned many sport cars including TR-3s,67 corvette, 70 corvette, and even a Lotus Elan, the 2000 Corvette coupe is a dream come true.  Its fast beyond belief.  Corners like its on rails, and with the optional real time dampening control it rides like a luxury sedan.  I would strongly suggest investing in all the options your pocket book can afford. I have only two regrets.  One is I did not purchase the heads up display.  The car accelerates so fast that in the time it takes to look down at the instruments you can be way, and I mean way beyond the speed limit.  The other is the lack of a second cup holder.  <br><br>
