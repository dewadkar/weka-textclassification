            Acura has gone from producing some of the most exciting and popular luxury automobiles with the latest Honda technology to playing catch up behind the other quasi-independent Japanese luxury car-makers. The styling had become rather bland to capitalize in the &quot;boring still appeals to more&quot; philosophy. The technology had become very unexciting. Acura's CL was not quite as exciting as originally intended, and with the Lexus GS series introduction as well as BMW's perennial sport sedan influence - Acura presents its 2.3 TL. A sport sedan with luxury and performance. The styling is catchy and looks sporty. The car comes with only one real option - satellite navigation. Everything imaginable is standard; including power everything and leather. Unfortunately, this means that only automatic transmission is available. This hints at its target market - people who want a sporty SEDAN not a SPORTY car with 4 doors. The engine is pure Honda - functional and efficient. The car travels to cruising speed smoothly and quietly. The suspension is soft and sedan. If critical, one notes a conflict of balancing performance and sport feel with the traditional qualities of a sedan such as road isolation and creature comforts. The TL is also priced just around the BMW 3-series market. It is a welcome extra option for those looking for a dependable sport sedan. Its appointments are the best for its price. The design of the TL is also modern and should stick around. It is also quite roomy and practical as a distance-traveller. Mechanically, it is sound transportation. If you want a loaded automobile that is nice, reliable, and fun to drive; this is a good car to look into. If you are a purist who would trade A/C for better tires, look elsewhere.
