            we've had two maximas, a 1996 and a 1999 model, both leased.  the car is extremely reliable and easy to drive.  it's comfortable to drive and to ride in, and its controls are laid out in a most logical and efficient way.

both cars have a squeaking noise in the center console which disappears when the weather gets warm.  with the 1996, we took it back to the dealer numerous times, and a rep from nissan even drove it for a weekend to hear the noise himself.  we were very impressed with the nissan rep.  he was responsive and respectful, and ultimately agreed there was a noise.  he directed the service staff @the dealership, who by this time were sick of the sight of us, in fixing the problem.  it never was fixed completely, but it improved a great deal.  with the 1999, we didn't bother, since it's basically only driven to the subway and back.

the maxima has a great remote keyless entry system which even opens the front windows when it's really hot outside.  the remote works from a long way away, which is a very nice feature.

the only drawback i can think of is a slight hesitation on acceleration from a standing start.  once i had the car for a while i learned to allow for this when merging onto highways.

another pro:  we found the dealership extremely easy to deal with.  on the 1996, there was a $1000 rebate that we didn't know about, and they told us.  we were impressed because we figured they didn't have to.

anyone who's interested in a reliable, mid-priced sedan with luxury car features should consider the maxima.  if you're overly sensitive to noises, skip it.<br><br>
