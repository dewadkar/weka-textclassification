            My father bought a '91 Grand Caravan about four months ago.  So far it has given him a few transmission problems.  When we got the vehicle the gas pedal was broken, but now everything is fine with the vehicle.

I am impressed with the quality and luxury of the minivan, especially for a 1991.  I thought that a lot of these features were only used on new vehicles.  First of all, I love the seats, they are really comfortable, and the driver's seat even has power settings to raise or lower it, tilt it, or move it back or forward.  There is a console above the dash board that shows the direction the vehicle is heading it, and the outside temperature.  The van has power locks that lock automatically when driving.  There is a lot of space in the back for luggage, etc., opposed to the normal Caravan.  The vehicle has a very smooth ride, and I look forward to taking a road trip in it.<br><br>
