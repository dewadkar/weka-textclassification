            I am a part-time professional photographer, specializing in weddings.  I have a 3 year old and a 6 month old at home.  I love to take pictures, but after buying a new house, decided that many things, including the amount of film I could shoot, had to be scaled back.  This camera was a great deal.  I purchased a couple of 16MB cards from CompUSA on the $20 cash back plan (one had a separate USB reader with it), so for an additional net of $60, have a total of 40Mb of memory.  I have an HP 970Cse printer, and have produced 5x7 photos with this combination of the kids.  I use the middle setting, allowing 20 pictures with the included 8MB card, so with the additional 2 16mb cards, I can shoot 100 pictures at a resolution high enough to satisfy my picky demands.  I already have 4 sets of rechargeable batteries for my professional cameras, so combined with the additional cards, the only time I have to spend money now for pictures of the kids is when I actually have to print something!!  I can shoot all day and not have to run to the 1 hr lab to see them.  Think of the money I am saving.  I can e-mail these photos to the grandparents, and like I've said, from start to finish, it no longer costs me anything.  While granted it does not have a true optical zoom, the Olympus Epic I carry in my briefcase does not either, and I have no problem with that.  Zoom lenses have their place, but as most professional photographers will tell you, they'd prefer a non-zoom lens to a zoom lens more times than not.  For the price, you can't beat it.  I highly recommend it.  <br><br>
