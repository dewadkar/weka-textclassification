            I love this car.  I have the 2.8 quattro automatic(no comments!) and it has enough get up and go to jump right into traffic and on the highway.  The car is a bit heave, 3,400 lbs but the engine compensates for the weight.  The gas mileage is very good if on the highway(27 mpg) but when driving around locally, it can be a slight gas guzzler(19 mpg).  You also need super, at least in the 2.8.  The fit & finish on the inside is the best feature of the car.  You can't get a Asian or North American car with the same level of quality on the interior.  Asian & US cars have cheap plastic and poor design, they should own a European car to see what they are missing.  The design is beautiful, spacious in the front, heated seats w/winter package is a must.  The wood trim is only avail. on the 2.8 and I think makes a big difference to the overall quality feel when sitting behind the wheel.  Have the tiptronic but not really using it, not sure how many people really do.  The BOSE system is great, very bassy but adjustable.  The sound is excellent.  The climate control works great but can be annoying sometimes...turn the fan up to high speed when you hit the auto button(car tries to reach the preset temp AS FAST AS POSSIBLE).  Would be happy if it took it easy, usually hit auto then hurry and slow the fan.  Just a small annoying feature but I really can care less.  The leather is also holding up very well, car is 4 years old now and looks brand new.  The factory warranty on the paint is great...any rust through and Audi will replace the panel.  The car when waxed is like a black mirror(have volcano black for color...pretty rare I guess, don't see any around) when waxed.  The clear coat is very good.  Would be nice to upgrade to the xenon headlights if possible, would opt if buying a new A4...much more visibility for safety plus looks much nicer, attracts attention.  The A4, at least 1999 doesn't come with a full size spare, not sure why.  The trunk is big enough for most of what you will need to put inside...excluding a mattress.  Heated mirrors are also available on the winter package, improves safety, can't put a price on that.  The ride is not pillowy soft, you'll feel the bumps in the road but this car is meant for driving, not for comfort...it's not a cadillac.

I was a little perturbed by some very minor repairs, dropping the car off, picking it up.  These included the air pump, solenoid, vacuum hoses.  The service was great, no charge and the problems were fixed.  The rear seats are pretty cramped and can only fit 2 small kids comfortably.

You can't go wrong with Audi.  Better quality than a VW which already surpasses it's competition as far as fit & finish and is cheaper than a BMW.  Audi has AWD, BMW doesn't except for the xi but it's only a 60/40 split AWD system.  Audi is also about $5k cheaper new and you get everything you'll find in a BMW...plus a more powerful engine.  Next car I'll get will be a 2008 A4, I'm sold on Audi now.
