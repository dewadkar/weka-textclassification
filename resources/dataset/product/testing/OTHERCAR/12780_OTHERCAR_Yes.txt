               On Thanksgiving week I was going through the newspaper adds for the big Thanksgiving day sales. I was perusing the Digital Camera ads that were placed in the addendums by Robert's Photo in Indianapolis. They had several very good buys on a variety of camera's.
   One that interested me was an ad for a Nikon Coolpix 800. The price was extremely good, it was a Mega pixel camera, good brand name of course, and my itchy trigger finger said shoot that extra dollar bill I had in my tri-fold.
   So I called Roberts Photo and them to check the availability of the Coolpix 800, and was told they only had one left in the store. I asked them if they would hold it for me until I could get there, and the good store that they are, told me yes but hurry.
   I rushed up to Robert's and as you can imagine as with any sale day the place was packed. I waited on my turn to be served and while looking around, noticed this Pentax EI 200 on the shelf. It had been marked down from $599.00 to $499.00. In addition Robert's was offering another $50.00 dollars off as part of their promotion. 
   I started comparing the features and the build of the cameras along with listening to my trusty Roberts salesman, whom I'd dealt with many times before over the years, and I decided to purchase the Pentax instead.
   The one important reason I switched was the USB interface that was used with the Pentax. I had found previously that this method of connection was faster (connecting and disconnecting) than using a serial port connection.
   When I got the camera home I found the same things mentioned in previous reviews on epinions. One, an adequate but very uninformative manual, that was satisfactory for the &quot;How To's&quot;, but lacked in the specifications area, and gave you absolutely no accessory information. Two, I found that after playing with it for about 20 minutes, the alkaline batteries that came with it went completely flat. Boy what a way to start off.
   Then I made the mistake off going to the CNET camera reviews and was really made to feel like a baffoon, when I read that their review of the camera showed high battery usage, and really bad pictures. I thought to myself dummy what did you do now?  Well I kept reading the reviews that the CNET readers had wrote and found that they were 180 degrees out from CNET. As a Matter of fact one wrote &quot; I don't know what camera you (CNET) reviewed but it must not be the same. Well a little relief came over me.
   I upgraded my batteries to the rechargeable Nickle Metal Hydrides, I purchased them from Radio Shack, and guess what? Battery life is now at an acceptable level.
   I also found the 8 Mega Byte Compact Flash Memory card to be way under-sized. I found an AVL 64MB card on Ubid.com which works great. Now I've got plenty of picture taking storage. 62 of the highest resolution jpeg photos, 121 at the middle resolution, and 228 of the low resolution photos all in the full size setting. However in the tiff format only 10 are available in full size, while 43 can be saved in 1/4 size.
   After using the camera I found that the photos taken in the auto focusing mode have been sharp and very true in color.
   I have not yet mastered the manual mode as the instructions are poor, but then I didn't buy it to use in the manual focus mode, so I don't know that I'm going to worry about it much. 
   The camera has some other features that are interesting but I'm not set-up to use them and probably won't. They are an infrared interface to a printer, a continuous play mode, 3 different light metering options, a time and date stamp, white balance, EV compensation, time lapse shooting, audio/video outputs, auto-rotation of photos, and many others.
   After using the Pentax camera for a while and getting used to it, I am completely satisfied and would recommend it to anyone except pros who would opt for a mega dollar camera anyway.
   Also after having already went the course, I would recommend the 32MB compact flash memory card over the 64MB card and would recommend looking at the Iomega Clik 40MB removable drives/compact flash readers.
   Oh, by the way F.Y.I., The Hewlett-Packard HP-618 is the same camera except it comes with a 16MB compact flash memory card.
