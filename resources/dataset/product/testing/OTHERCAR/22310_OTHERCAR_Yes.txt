            After our eight-year-old Voyager began to die on us, we began to search for a new vehicle to suit our family's needs. We were happy with the roominess the minivan had given us, and we couldn't imagine switching back to a car. With two parents, three growing children, and an often present grandma, it just would have been impractical. And besides, it was getting rather tiresome to always own one of a couple dozen box-shaped maroon vans in any given parking lot, making locating our own vehicle very difficult. On occasion, we even tried to enter someone else's car by mistake. 

When we saw the sleek new look of this Dodge Caravan, it was already classier than our current mode of transportation. The model we decided on is a cheerful shade of blue that ranges in description from simply blue to teal to aquamarine. Much to our dismay, we discovered upon buying this van that seemingly everyone who had owned the same Voyager we did decided to go ahead and get the same Caravan. To this day, we cannot park in a parking lot without seeing ten other identical blue Caravans with black plastic car-top carrier racks. Oh, well. You live, you learn. My advice? Get yourself a distinctive license plate or bumper sticker or some such item that will allow you to distinguish your van immediately. It'll save a lot of frustration.

The Dodge Caravan is an impressive vehicle with automatic steering and an incredibly smooth ride. Oddly enough, it was this smoothness that made it so hard for me to adjust to it. I found myself getting carsick practically every time I went for a ride. This was apparently due to the discrepancy between the motion and its not registering with me because of the smooth ride. I've nearly grown used to it by now, and those who don't suffer from motion sickness will most certainly enjoy this aspect of the Caravan. 

The upholstery is a cozy baby blue plush, offset by grayish plastic cupholders and side compartments which are very convenient for storing small games on a long trip. The back seat accommodates three people; the middle seat belt is the only one in the car not to include a shoulder strap. The middle seat holds two people, and there are two seats in front for the driver and passenger with space between them. One nice feature of this van is that it has back doors on both sides. They slide open and are a little tricky to operate at first; you have to press the button on the handle in and yank the door backwards. Sounds simple, but it gives more people trouble...

After years of arduous car trips in hundred-degree heat, everyone in my family agreed that this new van had to have air conditioning. And so it did. The heating and cooling controls are put to good use during many a sweltering Erie summer and many a frigid Erie winter. Since I have never driven the van myself, I am ill equipped to comment on its driving capabilities, but my parents find it very pleasant to drive and it provides a smooth ride and pretty good mileage. Thankfully, we have never had occasion to test the air bags, but they are in place and would no doubt be very helpful in the event of an accident. The only thing our van lacks is a stereo system. The additional cost for this seemed rather unreasonable, and my dad decided that he would install one himself for much cheaper. It hasn't happened yet; I somehow doubt it will. But hey, we've still got the radio.

I suppose this isn't the most glamorous of cars, but it's a little more attractive than the fake wood-paneled rectangular &quot;soccer mom&quot; vans (one of which we have since purchased as a second vehicle). It's ideal for a family with several children or someone who often transports other people. The Caravan is well worth the $18,000 it cost.<br><br>
