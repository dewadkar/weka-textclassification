            My wife and I are a middle-aged couple with 2 young children.  We were looking to replace our '92 Protege (great reliable car!) and we narrowed it down to the 2002 Civic and the 2003 Corolla.  We eliminated the Protege early on because of its dated technology.  This would be our second vehicle (used to supplement our minivan) for booting around town, running errands, etc.  We live in the Toronto area so some of my comments have a Canadian perspective.

Ultimately we bought a Civic because my wife preferred the interior and exterior aesthetics of it over the Corolla (other considerations in aggregate being a draw) and we've had it about 6 months.  Just so you know where I'm coming from, I'm an engineer and tend to over-analyze things, but the following are my findings.

Cost of ownership over the life of the car is much cheaper for the Civic.  2003 Corollas, from April 2002 to now, have been selling at or very close to list price because of the supply/demand situation.  Unfortunately I can never bring myself to pay list for a car.  Civics are cheaper to buy, cheaper to insure (check out Kanetix.com), and have considerably higher resale value (check out sites at Kelley Blue Book, Autotrader.ca, etc).

Engineering in the Corolla is superior.  Both cars get roughly the same gas mileage according to Government of Canada and manufacturer specs but the Corolla has 130 hp (and more torque) vs the Civic's 115 hp.  The Civic's engine compartment is wide open to the elements via the front wheel wells - you can see clear through from one wheel well to the other.  Makes me wonder what's going to happen during those snowy, slushy Canadian winters.

I like to change my own oil and the Civic's oil filter is located between the engine and firewall and accessible only from underneath the car.  Corolla's is at the "front" of the transverse engine, easily reachable from the top.  Civic also specs 5W20 oil which costs about $4/litre vs. the ubiquitous 5W30.

On the Civic there is a seam between the trunk lid and tail light that retains water after a rain and when you open the trunk, all the water runs into your trunk.  Honda has proudly eliminated the centre hump from the rear passenger compartment but the exhaust pipe/system is now the lowest clearance point of the car and exposed.  Again, what's going to happen trying to get out of my side street after a snowstorm?

Both cars are made of galvanized metal (except the roof) so rust resistance should be excellent.


Ergonomics is a draw.  Civic has great driving visibility and a very user-friendly dash layout, but there is also no power door lock switch on the front passenger door.  Corolla has more storage cubby room.  This seems like a picky point, but the Civic's sun visors are cheap, cheap, cheap.  I looked into replacing them with a set from the Acura 1.7, but they're the same cheapo ones.

No car is perfect, but overall we are very satisfied with the Civic.  It gets great gas mileage (over 600 km per tank, 50:50 city/highway) and most importantly when I drive around in it I don't feel like an old lady, which I surely would if I were driving a Corolla.
