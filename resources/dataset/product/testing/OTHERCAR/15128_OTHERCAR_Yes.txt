            I had read about the XG350L, when it came out and was interested in getting all the luxury touches for a low price.  Mine was the first my dealer had received and they were still trying to figure out how everything worked, when I walked in having just had a wheel come off my 93 Explorer.  

I was looking for a sedan and was interested in the previous year's model the XG300, but wanted a larger engine.  I also had to get over the idea of getting a Hyundai.  But, I knew the XG350L now had the bigger V6.  

It was love at first site, the Ivory Pearl paint was very attractive and the interior was fabulous.  I was a little concerned about the size, since I am 6'2" and over 300 lbs.  The front seat room (and headroom) are great.  My wife and I took it for a test drive and knew this was the car.  The $22,500 I paid was at least $4,000 to $6,000 than the best deal I could find on a Honda or Toyota equipped anything close to the Hyundai.  Having just turned in a 99 Honda EX coupe coming off lease, I found the Hyundai quality of materials and construction to be as good as the Honda's or better.

I get around 22 to 24 mpg, but wish it was a little more. 
The engine is very smooth with plenty of power.  I did notice the "lurchy" transmission at first, but after about 10,000 miles I am no longer aware of it, although there apparently is a programming fix available for free from the dealer. My mother has an 00 Avalon XLS that she loves, it is incredibly quiet inside, but the Hyundai is a very close second.

My biggest complaint is that to change the memory seats from my wife's setting to mine, you have to lean way in, insert the key, and turn the key to On (next to start).  I don't know why you shouldn't be able just to touch the memory setting button when you open the door.

The owners's manual could spend a little more time with an translator, as some instructions seem to have suffered a little in translation.  It also is missing a description of at least a couple of features.  For example, if you are using the memory seats, and you park the car with the parking brake set, then the driver's seat will move all the way back automatically to let you out and then move forward back to the memory position when you start the car.  This is not even mentioned in the manual.

I have hand no problems with the car.  Just a couple of oil changes over the first 10,000 miles.  I appreciate the high end Michelin tires.  The traction control system and the paddle shift capability have proved helpful in Colorado's mountains.

I have more than gotten over it having a Hyundai nameplate, and the friends who have either ridden in it or driven it, absolutely agree that is is an incredible car for the money and, in fact, a great care regardless of the price.

With the great warranty, I am sure I will drive it to well over 100,000 miles before even thinking about something else.  With that much mileage, the used value is not very important to me, but if Hyundai keeps making cars like this, trade-in value won't be a problem for long.
