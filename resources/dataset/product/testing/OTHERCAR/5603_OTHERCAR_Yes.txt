            The Mazda Protege was not the first thing I thought of when I started looking for a car.  I thought I wanted a Pontiac Sunfire, or some similar small sporty car.  Due to a few chance events, though, I ended up with a Protege.  I have come to love my car, so much that I got my brother to buy one also!  However, the Protege is NOT for everyone.  Don't even consider it if you are looking for power or sex appeal.  However, if you want an affordable ride that's semi-cool (at least it's not geeky like some other unnamed economy cars) and great on gas mileage, the Protege should be one of the first cars you test drive.

LOVES:

The gas mileage is GREAT!!!  I drove from Dallas, TX to Baltimore, MD and spent about $85 in gas.

There is a lot of room for the size of the car.  The trunk has a lot of space in it, which is good for college students that move around a lot.

The seats are comfy.  They aren't like sitting in La-Z-Boys, but they are surprisingly comfortable.  I do a lot of driving, so it is something I noticed first.  I also end up shuttling my friends around a lot, and they all seem to have no problem falling asleep in back either.

It's not a bad looking car either.  I can park in a lot full of more expensive cars without feeling embarrassed.  And the Proteges have some great colors out.  I have a Desert Red which resembles the color of sunsets in West Texas.

HATES:

Don't plan to do any fast acceleration on the highway (i.e., no zipping between cars).  Although it does have a benefit -- my Protege has forced me to be a better driver on the highway, and I also enjoy low insurance rates.

There is no arm rest.  I guess a lot of new cars don't have these, but I really miss having one!

The factory keyless remote system (I try not to call it an alarm system) is pretty cheesy.  The alarm horn sounds like Beaker from the Muppet Show (meep meep).  Hence, I named my car Beakermobile.  If you get an alarm, pay extra to get a good quality one, not the generic factory one.

Blasting the A/C really drains the power from the car.  My solution was to get my windows tinted.  This really helped out a lot.

Summary:

The Protege is a fun vehicle to drive.  You aren't signing away your arm &amp; leg when you buy it, so you can be a bit more carefree (although I still park on the other side of the parking lot to avoid door dings).  The Protege is low maintenance (just remember to get your regular oil changes &amp; brake inspections).  I haven't had any major work done yet (knock on wood) and I've had my car since 1997.  

I'd recommend the Protege to:

High school graduates entering the work force
College Students
Young professionals that haven't started rolling in money yet
Young couples

I would not recommend the Protege to:

Someone with money to buy a higher end vehicle
Those looking for high power and speed
