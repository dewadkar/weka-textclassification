            So my dad bought a Toyota Celica in 1990.  Thought it was a spiffy car -- red, sporty with a spoiler, turned on a dime and tore round corners like the dickens.  Even the AC and stereo impressed me.  So what does this have to do with now?

Well, after over a hundred thousand miles and ten years, this car's still tearin sh*t up!  There's no good reason this car shouldn't be dead as a doornail right now, but I'll be darned if it ain't as impressive as it ever was.

So I can't comment on how they're building them now.  But if the newest Celica's hold up like the 1990s did, you're getting a great car.<br><br>
