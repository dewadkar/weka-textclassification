            I picked one of these up for $30 used and am glad I didn't pay much more for it. In ideal light conditions with no movement the photos are acceptable for email and such, otherwise they look pretty bad.

I like the camera's LCD, nice and useful, when I get a real digital camera I'll be sure to look for one with a similar screen. Also I liked the fact that pictures are saved quite quickly, with some other digital cameras, even higher priced ones, there is a longer delay between click and save.

The camera seems to go through batteries quickly as well (it takes 4 'AA's) but does come with an AC adapter for when you are transfering pictures to your computer. This is a good thing seeing as the pictures take a very long time to transfer. As well, with the software that came with the camera you have to transfer thumbnails of each picture on the camera before you can download the full photo of any of them. If you have over a hundred photos on the camera this gets to be pretty annoying.

All in all this Casio has turned me on to the idea of digital photography, just not at a budget.<br><br>
