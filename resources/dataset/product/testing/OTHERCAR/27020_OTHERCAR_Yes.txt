This camera produces very good looking pictures, but its major flaw is the serial port and lack of a USB port.  Most of the newer cameras have a USB port and believe me, it makes a big difference!!  

The LCD screen is very sharp and really lets you review pictures you've already taken.  But its slow, cycling between pictures takes much longer on this camera than it does on my Fuji Finepix1400.  Maybe its slower because the LCD is bigger than the finepix and also better resolution. 

This camera does have a video out which produces beautiful images on your tv set.  I was really amazed by that feature, you can set it up to give a slideshow of all the pictures stores in your smart media card.  

I'd suggest buying additional smart media cards because the included 8 meg card isn't really enough for any serious picture taking!!!  In super high quality mode, you can get about 72 pictures in a 32 meg smart media card. I've seen 32 meg smart media cards for about $45-50 bucks.

Oh I almost forgot, another big flaw is the instruction manual. The stupid manual is written in 3 languages, and instead of making 3 parts, they put every other page with a different language! It was very confusing and difficult to read through the manual. It took me a while just to figure out how to change the quality settings...very annoying!
But once you figure it out, its fine...
