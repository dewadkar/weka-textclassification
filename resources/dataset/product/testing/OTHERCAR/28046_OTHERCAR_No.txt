            In my last opinion I wrote the story of my trouble with the two 2000 Plymouth Neons I have had in the past few months.  I have been back and forth with the dealership and the car was getting worse all along.  They finally admitted that there were problems and now they are giving me a full buy back under the lemon law on this car.  They are not deducting mileage and giving me sticker price.  It was a hassle but I just thought that anyone planning on buying one of these vehicles because of price better think again.  There is a problem with all of them.  Since my last opinion, my car has started surging forward with the brake on and the air conditioning system is messing up along with the stalling and missing and hesitating.  I plan on buying a 99 Pontiac Grand Am with a V-6 engine and I will then write my opinion on that.<br><br>
