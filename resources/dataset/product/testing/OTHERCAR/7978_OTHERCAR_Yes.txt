            I purchased my 2003 Altima and have had it for 14 months now.  I put a lot of miles on it and not all of them are highway.  I have been very satified with the car on virtually every aspect.  The powerful V-6 3.5 engine is almost too strong for a front wheel drive car. In fact that is one of the complaints I have. If you step on the gas and give it everything you could lose control fo the front of the vehicle. It's that powerful.  The roomy interior is another plus.  You can very comfortably fit five good size adults in this car with out a problem.  I love the styling and looks of the dual exhaust and the 17" wheels.  I have had no mechanical problems at all and I have 23,000 miles on this car.  If your thinking of buying one I recommend.  Only one other thing that I do not like about the car and it's the stiff ride that you get with the sports suspension. I know sports suspensions are suppose to be stiff but this car is way too stiff. In fact I did take it in to the dealer because I thought something was wrong.
