            Pssst!  Hey used luxury car buyer.  Want a great, loaded car for econobox dollars?  Find a '92-'95 Diamante.  Why?  Because the LS Diamante was so much car (and SO much money new - $30,000+), but they depreciated heavily and can be purchased used for a bargain.  USED DIAMANTES CAN BE PURCHASED FOR $4000 - $12,000.  The high end representing low miles '95's.  Here's what you get in the LS.
- A car that much of the automotive press compares to the new Lincoln LS in terms of looks and style.  Its an attractive car even today.
- 202 horsepower, dual overhead cam V-6
- 4 wheel disc, ABS brakes
- Leather interior (real nice quality)
- All standard power accessories (windows, locks, mirrors, seats, moonroof, antenna)
- memory seats
- great stereo (though no standard CD player)
- automatic climate control
- ALL THESE GIZMOS STILL WORKED IN MY CAR AT 112K
- 22 mpg (combined highway/local (60%/40%) driving.

NOTE: THE ES DIAMANTE HAS MANY OF THE SAME FEATURES EXCEPT THE 202 HP ENGINE.  THE ES HAS A 175 HP SINGLE CAM ENGINE (STILL PEPPY).

These cars costs $30,000 in 1992 and they drove like it.  What I loved about mine was the ride, which was compared to the larger Japanese luxury cars.  Also, the body held up.  After 8 years and 112,000 miles in Chicago winters and salt there was no rust.  In fact I've never seen a rusty Diamante.  Also, it had very few squeaks and rattles, even with high miles (I drove ES 300's with a fraction of the miles and they all were noisier - especially the sunroofs).  In my experience, Mitsubishi really stood behind this car.  Unfortunately, some of the dealers were not so great, but the company backed up the car whenever I called.  I had a great service guy in the North Aurora, IL Mitsubishi dealer, Doug Toll.

Things to watch for:
- Front brakes were a real weakness and rotors had to be replaced.  If the brakes shimmy - plan to buy rotors, not resurface them.
- Timing belts should be replaced at 60,000 miles.  Make sure it was done. Its not a cheap job ($400-$700), but a broken belt will take out the engine ($2000).
- Head gasket.  Mine started to leak at 75,000 miles.  It was a $900 job to fix, but when I contacted Mitsubishi (the manufacturer), they picked up the labor charges of over $600. 
- Find one with service records (at least oil changes).

I really loved my '92 Diamante and sold it expecting to buy a newer one ('98 or '99).  I ended up having to buy an Acura 3.5RL in order to match the ride quality of my old Diamante - even with the high miles.  I sold mine for $5000 with all scheduled maintenance current.

I like the newer Diamantes too, but opted for a bit more interior room in back.  They also depreciate fast and, therefore, can be a used car bargain.<br><br>
