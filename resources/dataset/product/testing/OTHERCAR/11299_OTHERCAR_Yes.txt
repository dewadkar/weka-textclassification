            If you're my age (21) there�s a good chance that you can look around your circle of friends and those that have cars at least one of them has a Honda.  I don't know why that is, or why everybody loves them but for anyone that like me that looks at a Honda and sees a glorified go-cart then a Mazda Protege5 is for you.

First off, I know that like a good majority of Hondas out there, the Protege5 is a hatch back but if you line up a Honda and a MP5 you'll notice one thing right off...a MP5 is the size of a normal car, therefore people 6'4 and over, like myself can actually fit in it with room to spare.  When I was first looking for a car, this was definitely a big selling point.  Second of all, a 2002 Honda Civic SI VELOZ, the fastest Honda civic you can buy still has * horsepower less than the MP5, also with all the options that came standard on my Protege5 for around $19k Canadian, it would cost exactly $29 715.64 (taken right from their own Honda builder) to match the options on the my Protege5 that cost me ten grand less.  Plus my car looks a whole bunch better.  

Now however much I do hate Hondas, I do love to do what almost every young Honda owner does to their car, which is customize it.  For the Protege5, customizing is a bit of a two sided thing, on one hand if you're into stereo's like I am, the car had amazing acoustics, on the other hand if you're into racing, then you're gonna have to search a little harder for aftermarket parts.  So far I�ve found that AEM makes the best Intake product specifically for the Protege5, its called the "AEM Short Ram", also you can replace your filter with a K&N filter for a 2001 regular Protege (mod#: 33-2134) and an Ingen Cat back exhaust system ends off the whole package nicely.  However if you want to avoid spending about 700 cdn + tax and you're not quite into the car stuff you can just wait and buy the bolt on turbo that Mazda will bring out near the summer of 2003 which will take the horsepower from 135 - 175 which in that weighted/sized car will be daaaaaamn sweet.  

On the stereo end, I recommend you take a trip to your local alpine dealer and pick up a set of 12" Alpine Type S Subs, not the best Alpines you can get (that would be the type-r's) but for the price they beat everything else for that price out there, match those with an alpine mono amp and two alpine type-r component speakers (you can mount the tweeters on the inside of the side mirrors) and you will be flying.  All in all the car is what actually makes the system work well. But back to the car.....

One last thing before I end this, no matter how bull headed you are about buying a new Honda or focus or whatever, just check this car out first.  Its got way better power and derivability than the Hondas, and definitely better looks than a focus (then again pretty much everything looks better than the focus) and trust me once you slide into its comfortable sport seats, gun that engine, shift it into first and pull out onto the road, you'll know for sure that this will be your car.
