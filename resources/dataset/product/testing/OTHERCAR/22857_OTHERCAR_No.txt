            This is the second Seville I have owned and the last.  The first car was repurchased by Cadillac based on the &quot;Lemon Law.&quot;  The 1998 STS I now own has more quality problems that I can discuss.  Cadillac's comments on some of my problems are &quot;that's a characteristic&quot; of the car.  Drive line &quot;thumps&quot; seats that move by themselves, headlights that turn themselves off while going around a curve at night, need to turn off the radio before you can listen to a station, compressors that run all the time in the trunk area, wind noise, squeaks, rattles, finish that comes off the various buttons, poor leather...  get the idea.

The dealers I have worked with have all been great, its the engineers in Detroit that need a consumer education.<br><br>
