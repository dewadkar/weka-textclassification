            Back when I was single, I had my heart set on buying a Pontiac Grand Am because I took one out for a test drive and it was love at first sight! Much to my dismay, I never got to buy one but I told myself one day I would. Well, 10 years later, I still don't have one but I have something that I love even more! I just recently got myself a 1994 Pontiac Transport SE and this is one nice minivan!

The vehicle that I previously owned was a van as well but as of late, wasn't running too well so I took it to get checked and after getting the bad news, I decided to trade it in for another van.

This van is white with powder blue interior that seats seven comfortably and is fully loaded. Now although I'm not too crazy about the color white, that is the ONLY thing that I see that bothers me because this baby is really nice!

First off, it comes with an AM/FM Cassette Radio with five presets for your favorite radio stations! The quality of sound that comes out of this stereo is superb and since I love my music, it's a very important feature! 

The air conditioning works great and right about now, it's really needed. It has power windows, power door locks and an automatic door opener for the two front doors as well as the sliding side door. The button for the sliding door is located overhead between the front seats and this feature was one that caught my eye as it keeps the kids from slamming the door every time they get in and out! It also has a power button for this behind the passenger seat so the kids can open and close it as well...without breaking the door or giving me a headache! 

The windshield wipers have the three settings that are standard on most vehicles along with a mist button as well. It does have a back wiper as well which is a nice advantage! The lights are pretty standard with everything on the dash but at night when you turn it on and turn the lights up, it lights up the whole dashboard giving off the appearance of a spaceship with the green and red lights!

The seats are fully adjustable in the front with a lever underneath and a wheel on the side of the seat to recline or bring up to the perfect height! The back seats go up and back but each seat can go down as well with cup holes on the back of each to hold beverages!

Since I've only had this since Wednesday, I'm still learning more and more about it but I do know it's great on gas because I filled it right after getting it and the needle has barely moved. This is just a guess but I'd estimate it as getting at least 25 mpg in the city and over 30 mpg on the highway. 

This vehicle is definitely a step up for us and it rides very smoothly...like you're floating on air! We're extremely happy with this vehicle and I believe you would be too so I highly recommend it! <br><br>
