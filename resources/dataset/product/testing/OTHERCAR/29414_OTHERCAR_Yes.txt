            I believe that the Porsche Boxster is one of the best cars ever built.  This car is meant for all ages.  If you need a fast car to impress the ladies, here it is.  Or if you need a sleek, stylish, and fast car for leisure, the  Boxster is it.  Believe me, you will definitely be noticed in the Porsche Boxster.

This car is compact with all of the great features.  First of all, the engine is practically a racing machine.  You can hit 250 horsepower at about 6250 RPMs in the Boxster.  That is pretty quick for a 6 cylinder car that weighs about 2,855 pounds.  When this car drives past you, there is actually a whistling noise as it passes.  Another great quality of the Boxster is that it gets about 18 miles per gallon.  Most cars that can move as fast as the Boxster burn gas like there is no tomorrow.  You will not be running to the gas station in this car every few days.

Another great feature of the Porsche Boxster is how smooth and quiet the ride is.  While driving this car you don't have to be bothered by all of the commotion that is going on outside the car.  You can enjoy the ride with this great car.  The seats of the Porsche Boxster are incredibly comfortable.  You could take a nap in this car if you want to, but who would want to sleep in such a thing of beauty.

I have not driven this car, but I know it has great acceleration and the turning is like you are stuck to the road.  You will not have to worry about being asked to race when your in this car.  People know that you will blow them off the road in this thing.

I love everything about this car.  With a six speed transmission and all of the great attributes that I have just mentioned, you canï¿½t go wrong.  The only thing I find upsetting about this car, is the price and there is not as much room as you would want.  There is a tiny back seat with only enough room for two people.  Although the price is not too high for such a fine piece of machinery, you will need to spend around $45,000 for this car.  Other than that, everything is great.  I highly recommend this car.  The Boxster surely will fulfill your need for speed!
