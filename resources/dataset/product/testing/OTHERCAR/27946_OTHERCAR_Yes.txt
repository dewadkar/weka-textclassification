            Audi's current A4 model is a great car. While slightly smaller than its sisters (The A6, S6, A8, and S8), the A4 is less expensive and nearly as high quality. The A4 quattro (four wheel drive) is also a great buy, yet it is several thousand dollars more than the regular A4. The quattro is worth the price though, easily out performing the regular A4 in rugged conditions.

Comfort-wise, the A4 is reasonable, for its size. Weighing much less than most luxury cars, the ride is slightly less smooth. Yet, if equipped with leather seats and power-everything, then the A4 can be rather comfortable.
The only problem with the A4 is that it does not make for a great family car. The back is a bit too cramped for long distance rides with the kids. 

If you're in the market for a high performance, reasonably priced, and fairly comfortable vehicle, the A4 is the way to go. Often drive your car in rugged conditions? For an extra several thousand dollars, the A4 Quattro is also a great buy.<br><br>
