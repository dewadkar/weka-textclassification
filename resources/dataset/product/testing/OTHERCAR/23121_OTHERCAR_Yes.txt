            Dodge has really scored big points in my view with it's mid-size car, the Dodge Stratus.  The Stratus with it's sleek design inside and out has easily has to be one of the most overlooked cars out there.  I love the  way the car is designed around the driver with the controls just in the right spot.  The handling on this car is superb on cornering and on quick turns.  The gas mileage is a real plus at over 25 m.p.g.  For me i need a lot of leg room and that is just what the Stratus provides.  Interior room is just right in the Stratus for even a family of five. The only real disadvantage that i saw was the fact that the front window seemed to be so sleek that it was sometimes hard to see out of if not in a fully upright position. All in all, i would recommend this car as a great mid-size vehicle. <br><br>
