            We bought our Toyota 4 Runner because we researched Consumer Reports for reliability information and it was also one of the best looking SUV's around  but good looks and Reliability were the good points I can tell you about. It was terrible on gas even though it was a 4 cylinder and that was an enormous mistake we discovered when we went to trade it after I had our last baby and we took a miserably uncomfortable 7 hour trip to Virginia with me sitting in the back seat with the baby. I felt every bump on the road multiplied and felt guilty not having known how uncomfortable our other two children must have been all the other months we owned our 4 runner. When we went to trade it we were $8,000.00 upside down and had to sell it away from the dealership where we bought our Lexus RX300 which we love!<br><br>
