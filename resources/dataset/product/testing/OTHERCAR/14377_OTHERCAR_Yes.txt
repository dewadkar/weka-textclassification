                There's nothing small about the 1970 Sedan DeVille by Cadillac.  Correction, there's nothing small except for the gas mileage.  My 1970 Cadillac is forest green with creme colored interior.  It's in great shape as well.
    It's very comfortable to ride in.  I drove it 2000 miles in one day, and I was pretty much comfortable the whole ride.  It has climate control; you select the temperature and it will try to maintain that temperature, am/fm radio (luxury, pure luxury) and automatic seats and windows, though one of the motors on the window is shot.  Of course, it has power steering as well.
    It is a bit hard to drive.  I'm used to smaller, imported cars, so driving this boat was a big switch for me.  It has a really bad turn radius, and it's so big that parking is feet not to be tried by the weak of heart.  
     It's also very expensive to keep running.  Parts for a car that old are very difficult to find, and expensive.  It has points and condensors, which basically means tune ups cost a lot more.  I also get about 10 miles per gallon.  A fillup usually runs between 25 - 30 bucks.
