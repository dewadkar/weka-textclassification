            I am a big truck lover already but these s-10's are the best by far. S-10's are great on gas money, small yet roomy, and best of all..Affordable.  I recommend a S-10 for any kind of person, they are good as work trucks, travel trucks, and even young kids just learning to drive.  These are also great for towing on the s-10's with the 4x4 option.  Also easy to load onto the bed of theses trucks cause they are lower to the ground than most other trucks.  They come in automatic, or manual transmission.  Options include air conditioning, extended cabs, dual air bags, extended box.<br><br>
