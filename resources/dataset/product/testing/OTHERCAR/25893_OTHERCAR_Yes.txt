            Back in November of 1999 we purchased a used 1998 Plymouth Breeze. I had just been in an accident where my other car was totaled.  We went to the car lot where I approached the salesman and told him that I wanted a car that was not overly expensive that was big enough to fit three kids in the back seat without them being so close that they would kill one another. He said he had just the car for me. He took us over to look at a Platinum colored Plymouth Breeze. It was one year old with 35,000 miles on it. This made me very leary until I found out that it had been owned by Enterprise Car Rental(thus being the reason for all the miles). Then, I got thinking about it... everytime I have ever rented a car, they have always been well taken care of and maintained. Then, I asked the salesman what they were asking for this car. He said $9995. I thought that wasn't too bad, since we had looked at other lots with cars that were three and four years old with higher prices than this one. 

Our new car is very reliable. A week after we bought this one, we bravely took it on a four and a half hour trip t St. Louis. Everything was just fine. The car had absolutely no problems. And, neither did the kids in that HUGE back seat. 

That back seat is so big that you can fit three adults in it comfortably. Large back seats really are great. 

This car is wonderful on gas mileage. We went on that earlier mentioned four hour trip and used right at about a half tank of gas. I was pleasantly surprised. 

I am very pleased with my Plymouth Breeze. I would suggest that anyone with children, car seats, pets in carriers, or anything that takes up plenty of room check these cars out when car shopping. Good gas mileage and nice size. They get my vote.<br><br>
