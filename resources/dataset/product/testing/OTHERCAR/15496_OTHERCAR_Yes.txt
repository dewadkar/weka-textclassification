            This is a FUN and SIMPLE camera loaded with features!! My whole family can easily navigate the menu and take pictures. The LCD screen is very clear and I believe superior to many digital cameras already on the market. The 3.5 floppy disk is SO mobile and convenient. From the camera, I was able to copy the disk and give duplicate floppy disks to everyone requesting one. VERY COOL feature. Picture quality is very good but not great. My only two complaints with this camera include the price (fairly expensive) and the battery life. The camera is VERY thirsty and burns through batteries quickly. Bottom line, buy an extra battery.
