            I have been driving my 1992 Toyota Tercel for almost a year now, and what a year it's been.  Since I am the type of person who hates to stop until I get where I am going, I really put my car to the test.  To keep this opinion easy to read, I will list some of the things that I have done in my car:

This little red car has been through rainstorms in North Carolina.
Snow filled mountains of VT.  
More than a dozen trips from New Hampshire to New York (about five to six hours based on your speed).
From Maine to North Carolina (about 15 to 16 hours non-stop).
Over an hour to work (and another hour back) five days a week.  
I have run the motor dry of every fluid possible, from oil to gas to windshield wiper fluid.
I have bounced it off a guardrail (on purpose) after the guy in front of me lost control.

My point is that this car has held its own even after I have beat it and neglected it.  I don't know too much about cars, but I do know that my mechanic would slap me if he knew what I had been doing.  I would recommend this car to anyone who does not have the money to buy a fancy car, but wants something that will run even if they forget what type of oil they need, and go with whatever is available (or the one that they can afford). 
Even with all the stress I put on it, despite a few scratches on the side of the car, and needing to get it realigned,  it still drives like the day I got it.<br><br>
