            I cannot be happier with this van. For an 8 year old automobile, with 150,000 miles, this is pretty damn good.
First of all, yes this is my first car and a lot of you may think that I'm easily impressed. Well, I've test driven a lot of used cars before getting this one and I really liked how the Transport drives. It feels and drives like a car and it's sporty.

It's roomy and has seating for 7. The back seats are removable or you can fold them down and use the cup holders in the backs. The front seats are motorized and you can adjust them for comfort as you're driving. 
The thing that amazes me about this van is the convenient features. Now, keep in mind that this is an 8 year old van I got for $1,500...

The power sliding door is on the top of my list. It's very convenient when you're dragging a huge bag of groceries. You can open the door with your key-less entry remote as you're walking toward the van. The power sliding door also opens from the drivers seat or the back seat. You can disable this feature for protection if you have kids. If the car is in drive, there will be a very loud buzzing sound if the door opens. Also, once you put the car in drive, all the doors automatically lock.

The oversized break lights in the back are great and give the van a UFO ish look at night. There are 3 settings for heat and air (top, foot, or both) and the interior lights turn on when the door is opened. Ok ok so these aren't exactly the most impressive features in the world, but I thought I'd list them.

The car drives horribly by the way. hehe. just kidding. It drives nice. Like I said, it feels and handles like a car and after 150,000 miles it's still ticking pretty strong.

Now, about miles per gallon... If I fill up the tank, which costs me about $37 in new york city by the way. I can drive for a week. And I drive 20 miles a day. Well, you do the math.
