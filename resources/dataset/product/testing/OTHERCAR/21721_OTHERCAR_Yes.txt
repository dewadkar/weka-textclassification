            My very first car was a used 1988 Chevy Cavalier. That car had been through the ringer more than once, but it stayed reliable and trustworthy all the way to the day that we put it out to pasture.  It sort of grumbled sadly on the way to the junkyard, but it got there just as it got me to wherever I needed to go.  It was because of the sturdyness of this first car that I favored Cavaliers when I was in the market for buying a brand new car.

I researched many manufacturers and models, and test drove the ones in my price range, but the Cavalier STAYED in my price range even after adding in the extras that I wanted.  The 3.9% for 5 years was very nice, too.  I could have gotten 1.9% for 3 years, but I didn't want my monthly payments to be THAT high.

It is now almost 2 years after I first bought my car, and not a day goes by that I dont drive it and think to myself &quot;wow, what a great car.&quot;  Even after 2 years, it drives as quietly as it did when I first drove it off the lot.  I like to reflect at stoplights on how you cant even hear my car idle.  

I'm a fairly short person, 5'3&quot; on a good day, and I can reach the pedals with no problems. That was a BIG issue when test driving other cars, there are many cars which is a stretch for me, and I wouldn't feel comfortable driving a car where I'm breaking with the tip of my toes.  My fiance is a bit over 6', and he has no problems reaching the pedals, too.  The seat goes back far enough so he can drive comfortably.  And the Cavalier has the headroom so none of us have to crane our necks when we sit down.

The backseat is fairly roomy as well.  I can sit comfortably behind my 6' fiance when he is driving.  However, our 6'+ friends complain about no leg room (they all fight to sit behind me, since I can pull the seat all the way up).  But even with 3 grown adults sitting in the backseat, legroom is their only complaint.  There's plenty of arm and headroom back there.

I had one problem with my car not quite a year ago.  A wire from the fuel system snapped one day, and my car kept jerking and hesitating.  Scared me to death.  However, it got me safely to the nearest gas station before it stalled and refused to be started again.  I appreciated that.  But because my car was only a year old, the snapped wire was covered by the warranty, as were the towing costs and everything else.  I only lost a half hour of work.

Now I'm at a time in my life where money is tight, the last thing on earth I want to have to worry about is whether or not my car will make it through the winter. I'm so glad that I dont.  Buying this car was one of the smartest things I've done with my life, and I feel confident that it will stay reliable and last me another 8 years at the very least.<br><br>
