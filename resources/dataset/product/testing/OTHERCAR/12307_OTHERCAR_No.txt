            I have a 1999 Eclipse GS-T, the 2nd generation style as you can tell by the year.  I love my car to death and it is a great car to mod.  I have been in the DSM (Diamond Star Motors) community for quite a while now and have always enjoyed working with the 4 bangers and turbos.  However, Mitsubishi has made a grave mistake with the new 2000 Eclipse, if you could even call it that.  They had just got their foot in the door with the racing community, and then they drastically change everything.  I drive by my local Mitsubishi dealership almost daily, and I see the Y2K Eclipses always sitting there, never moving....because no one wants them!!!  They are ugly, look like a Grand Prix, less power, no turbo, no AWD, and what is going on with the gas cap???  There are three models, the RS, GS, and GT.  The GT is basically the only one that has any kick to it at all.  It has a 3.0L V6 under the hood, which means it is not even a DSM anymore.  If they are trying to compete with the Toyota Supra, then they have a long way to go to be with the RWD twin turbo all-star.  I have a feeling that the Toyota Celica, Supra, or maybe even for some people the Mercury Cougar will be the choice for a good, import (minus Cougar), sporty car.  I have been in a test drive with the 2000 Eclipse and it felt like the car was asleep, although it did have more room to sit in like your grandparents sedan.  This is not a sport car, and never will be.  Buy a 90-99 model of the Eclipse and save your time and money!!!<br><br>
