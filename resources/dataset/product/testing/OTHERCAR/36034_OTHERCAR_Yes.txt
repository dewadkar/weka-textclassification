                I have to question every person that considers the word "saab" to be baby gibberish.  Living in Dallas and owning a 1996 saab 900 S, I realize that the company does not receive the proper amount of exposure as it does in say, New York.
    
    I'm a new driver, but even at 16 I know that this is a fantastic make.  My first taste of the customer base to saab occurred when trying to find a saab.  My family couldn't afford to pay a lot for a car especially a first car, so I had to look into used cars.  I'll tell you this much: saabs more than two years old DO NOT exist.  When I finally located a man selling his saab even remotely close to me and not Canada I sprung on the opportunity.
     
     I called the ad and spoke to the owner.  While I was asking about the specifics of the car the man rambled on about how it broke his heart to sell it.  He always referred to it as a "he" saying, "I hate to sell him.  He's kind of like my child."  I set up a date to meet the man and look at the car, but when the day came the man cancelled saying that he had decided not to sell his car.
     
     Naturally I was dumbfounded.  The man made it seem like I was trying to murder his first born son when he was the one who put the ad in the paper.  I had just about given up my search and was nearly settled on buying a VW jetta when I found a true love.
     
     1996 saab 900 S.  5-speed 2.3 liter 4.0 cylinder engine. automatic front power windows.  heated front seats.  Air conditioning.  windshield wipers on the headlights. thermometer. and the ignition switch is next to the freaking parking brake!  The car was beautiful. Plus I found it at a dealer, which gave me the option of warranty and whatnot.  I got all this and a bag of freaking chips for 9,995.  Incredulous must be the word.
     
     The only downside to the entire package was the fact that since its a 1996 model the stereo system came with a tape deck vs a cd player.  I asked if they could change out the system, but they said that saabs have an anti theft solution that involves irremovable radios.  I could have put in a cd changer in the back for a few more dollars but I kept the cash for something else.
     
     Anyway, I bought a tape deck adapter and hooked up my portable cd player to it so now I cruise peacefully to Yanni, Celine Dion, and Barbara Streisand.  Er, um, something like that.
     
     I know now why saabs owners love their cars.  Stylish. Cutting edge (even 6 years old).  Comfortable.  Sporty.  It's undeniable love.
