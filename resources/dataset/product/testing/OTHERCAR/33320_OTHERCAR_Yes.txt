            In August of 1998 I was determined to buy an Explorer or Forerunner but an article in Consumer Reports on the Subaru Forester prompted me to check it out first. I never made it to the other dealers - left the lot with my new Forester and have been a VERY satisfied car owner since.

I put my new car to the test by driving cross country, coast-to-coast, one week after purchasing it.  It handled beautifully!  Three years later I have not yet had any major problems with it, and it still purrs like a kitten.  Passengers have commented on how quiet it is, and I love how well the AWD handles in every type of weather.  I've even successfully taken it off-road camping several times.

The gas mileage is great, there is tons of head room and leg room (even in the back seat), I've even been able to pack in 3 adults, 2 kids, a full-grown Malamute/Sheperd and camping equipment for all.

Probably the best bonus about the Forester is that it is built like an SUV, but for insurance purposes it is considered a 4-door wagon.  Gotta love that!

The only thing I have not liked is the automatic window gears/motor has had to be adjusted several times.  Otherwise, I think this is the best SUV on the market today.
