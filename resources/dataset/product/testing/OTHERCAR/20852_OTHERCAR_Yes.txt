            Ok. I live in California, more specifically, Northern California so gas prices are a rather sensitive issue for me with a gallon of unleaded reaching for $2.10 already. So, I'm looking for a fuel efficient and dare I say environmentally friendly car.

As a starting point, the 2001 Prius is OUTSTANDING. I strongly encourage you to pressure your Toyota dealer to let you take a test drive (my friend in Phoenix couldn't get a dealer to let him). The car handles surprisingly well and I couldn't discern any serious limitations for a commuter-type/every-day car.

So where does the car "fall down" for me... its the little stuff that Toyota usually gets right. The dash is down right bizzare with everything in the center rather than focused around the driver (its similar to the Echo). I don't like it, others may find it less objectionable.

Then as others have noted there is the small trunk sans-folding seats and a lack of cruise control.

Lastly, don't be fooled by the dealer saying the car is GPS/Mapping system ready, apparently although that is theoretically true (in Japan it is available) it is a proprietary system so at least currently available after market parts can't plug-and-play.

If you can live with these down sides, you will end up with a very nice car that is extremely fuel efficient.
