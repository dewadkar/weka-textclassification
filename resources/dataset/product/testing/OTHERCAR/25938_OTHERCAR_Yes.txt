            I have now owned my Pontiac Grand AM SE for about 4.5 months, and little by little, things are beginning to wear out, at a faster rate than I am.

The seat belt covers are coming off, the sun visor holder has come out of the headliner, when the oil was changed recently, the oil light had to be reset (part of the manufacturer's design,) the trunk carpeting was originally cut too short and has curled and twisted into a unique design, the lug-nuts have popped off a couple of tires, the bucket seats have stuck in various positions except the upright one, the radio volume control knob gets stuck on loud and can't be turned down, and just yesterday, a small rock was hurled at my windshield from the turning wheels of the semi-truck in front of me, and as a crack made its expensive way across the windshield, it made me wonder that if the glass is made as cheaply as the rest of the car seems to be, then I'm in trouble when parts of the engine start cracking as well.

And the real clincher?  A 20/20 segment showing the Grand Am to be one of the worst cars to own if involved in a collision.  Maybe I should try to trade it in for a Pontiac Firebird.  Maybe I'll do it when Grandma's taking her afternoon nap because otherwise, I'll have to wrestle her to the ground for the keys.
