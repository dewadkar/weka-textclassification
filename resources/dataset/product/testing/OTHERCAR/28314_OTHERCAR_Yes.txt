            Not too long ago, I purchased an Amigo.  I wanted one from the first day I ever saw one.  I have always liked the look of it, and with the removable cover on the back part, it looked like it would be a fun vehicle to own. 
To date, I have not been disappointed.  The Amigo is truly fun to own, and has been, for me, an extremely reliable vehicle.  
The things that I hate about the Amigo are few, but do exist... (I would be worried if there was not something wrong) ;-)  First, it seems that unlike every other SUV with a removable cover, there are very few third party replacements for the cover, and for that matter, very few extras designed for the Amigo.  My search has turned up only a couple of sources that contain Amigo items in their catalogs, and usually the items would only fill one or two pages at most.  Second, the designers apparently thought that the oil filter did not need replaced, ever...  since they put it just above a couple of the bars involved in the steering mechanism.  It is possible to get the old filter off, and a new filter on, but there will be a lot of struggling to get your oil filter tool on and off.  If you go to a shop for oil changes, this will not concern you, but make sure you don't offend the people at the shop. ;-)  Third, and apparently they learned from this already, there is a pretty big blind spot in the older model Amigos.  The area on the passenger side from directly behind the passenger door's window, to where the removable cover begins, or to the removable covers window, is a very difficult area to notice if there is a vehicle beside you if you need to change lanes.  I noticed that the 1998 Amigo seems to have taken steps to eliminate this problem.  
Now, for the things that I love about the Amigo.  First, and foremost, there is nothing that I enjoy more than having a removable cover to allow the most enjoyment of a nice warm summer day.  Second, I believe that since the Amigo has an actual hard, metal, normal roof over the driver and passenger's seat, that it does not suffer from the higher rates of a convertible vehicle. Third, and this actually surprised me, is the amount of cargo space inside the Amigo.  After folding up the rear seat, there is quite a lot of room in there for any transportation need that might arise.  I have been able to help a few friends move with this, and even they were amazed with how much my Amigo could hold.
The Amigo is a very fun vehicle to drive.  It offers a fairly comfortable ride, and aside from the need to be careful around sharp turns, is a very fun vehicle to drive.  Most of the controls are within easy reach of the driver's seat.  Being a tall person, there is plenty of headroom for me in the Amigo, which is something that very few vehicles that I have been in have provided.  
All in all, I think the Amigo is definitely the way to go for the smaller SUV market.  I always dreamed of owning one, and now that I do, I have not been disappointed.
