            I had driven several of them and they are very comfortable, and they have some great power to them.  One problem sets them apart.  If anyone has owned a 94 or 95, you just bought one of the worst years that the LHS came out.  The 94's weren't bad, but the electrical troubles are phenominal.  Not to mention the fact that my friend had one that ignited in his driveway for absolutely no reason at all.  It wasn't even running.  Matter of fact it wasn't driven all day.  The reason electronic climate control failed and sparked a fire.  The 95's were somewhat improved, but still the electrical systems were rated average.  Which means it is still a bad risk, and judging by some of the problems that other people have had with them.  I would highly advise anyone to stay away from these 94 and 95's.  Even if you do have a mechanic inspect it, chances are even if it is absoulutely perfect, you'll have it in the shop in 3 months give or take.  The 96's on the other hand were like the improved versions.  Same options, better quality.  The transmissions on these cars will last a lifetime, and the motors will take on even the toughest of everyday driving.  I like the options on this car especially.  The standard options include power windows and doors, power seats, digital climate control, Infinity am/fm stereo cassette, most of them came with leather, though I think this was optional, digital temperature read out, and the optional items include Infinity am/fm CD, or Infinity am/fm Cassette/CD, Power sunroof/moonroof, and keyless remote entry.  The 3.5 liter v6 will carry you anywhere you want to go reliably and efficiently.  The seats are comfortable and roomy enough to please even the fussiest person in the family.  I even like the looks of this car.  I would highly recomend this car to friends and family.  It is very impressive for the price.   <br><br>
