            The Oldsmobile Bravada is a well made vehicle. The styling is what first attracted me. GM and Oldsmobile did a great job on this sports utility vehicle. The interior is spacious and comfortable. Everywhere you turn there is a cup holder. The seats are very comfortable. The V6 engine provides plenty of power for you to haul whatever you want. The Bravada has an extremely smooth ride for a truck. Oldsmobile combined the grace of a luxury car with the ruggedness of a Jeep Wrangler. I would recommend any die hard GM person to purchase one. If you don't like Oldsmobile or Gm you should not buy this SUV. I almost have a hard time calling it an SUV or a truck. It is so Luxurious and handles so well you feel as if you are in a car.<br><br>
