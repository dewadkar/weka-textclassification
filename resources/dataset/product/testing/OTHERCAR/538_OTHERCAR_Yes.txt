            A few months ago we bought a 1999 Hyundai because the price was right and we wanted a newer car.  This month we had to replace another car.  The Hyundai was ok, we had one at home so knew what to expect from it, and we wanted something a step up from what we had.  After driving everything that was in our price range we wound up with the 2000 Hyundai, and found it was, indeed, a step up.

The 2000 model accent has power steering, thank goodness, something that our 1999 does not have.  It makes quite a difference in the ride.  And while the 99 holds 65 comfortably, the 2000 holds 75 comfortably.  Shifting is smooth with an assisted(?) clutch, also an upgrade from the 99.  The drivers seat even has a tiny armrest.  My son, 6, was very impressed with the cup holder that ejects gently when you give it a little push.  :)

The interior fabric cleans up well, and the dash is not real cheap looking.  The air works great.  The only issue the car has is a lag when starting cold, feels like it is not getting enough power at first if you try to take off to fast in the morning.  Warm it up a few seconds first.

Also, I test drove an automatic.  I wouldn't recommend the auto.  It lags between gears, definately less power.  Go for the stick shift if you are getting this car.

I spent a very long time reading product and safety reviews.  When it came down to it the price was the best on this vehicle.  It does have dual airbags.  This is the 4-door model, and my son is comfortable in the back seat.  My husband is 6'5 and drives this car.  I am 5'5, and am quite comfortable in it.  It has more front-seat room than the 99 model that we have, and the trunk is pretty roomy.

By the time we made it off the lot with air conditioning, paint sealing, cargo net, pinstriping, destination,  etc.- we ended up having paid $13k (with taxes and loan fee, the works).  Not bad for a brand new car.  

One word of caution-- we got the model without auto locks and keyless entry, assuming we could go back and get them later for the $400 price difference.  Then I found out that to have them installed after buying it would cost about $1000.  Ouch!

My Hyundai is desert sand, a pretty gold color-- but don't park next to a regular gold car in it, makes the desert sand look green.  ;)

I think this is a great car for a young family or starting out.  The roadside assistance is terrific-- they'll even come out to unlock your keys for 5 years for free, won't find that many places.  Cancelled my AAA, saving some money there too.  It's not luxury, but you knew that.  It's a practical ride.<br><br>
