            I bought my Z24 in July of 1997 and I am still very happy with my purchase.  After a LOT of time researching cars (1+ years), I decided that I really wanted to buy domestically, and since I was able to secure a GREAT deal through a family friend, I finally chose my green metallic Z24.
I originally bought this car at Cody Chevrolet in Montpelier, VT.  Cody was fantastic to do business with and I recommend them highly to anyone looking to buy a Chevy product.  At that time, I commuted about an hour to and from work each day and my Z never failed me.  This car handles great in all conditions (rain, snow, ice) and is a dream to own.  The only trips to the mechanic that it sees are for regular maintenance (oil change, tire rotation, etc.) -- even after 3 years of ownership.
The interior is very comfortable; my sister and I drove from Vermont to Oregon last year and spent hours and hours in the car with no discomfort.
Another great benefit of the Z24: many 'options' are standard features!  My model year came with A/C, trip odometer, foglamps, cassette player, and cruise control.  I really could not have gotten a better deal for my money!!<br><br>
