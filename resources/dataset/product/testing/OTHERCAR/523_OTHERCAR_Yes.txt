                 Now I have to be honest, I bought this camera because I thought it looked cool.  I wanted a sleek looking camera and this was it.  However when I got it I found out that it was much more than looks.  
     It has a 10x optical zoom and a 2.6x digital zoom.  It has a dimension of about 4.3 W x3.3 H x 5.6 D.  The maximum resolution that it can present is 1600 x 1200.
     The lens is 7mm to 70 mm (equivalent to 38mm to 380mm on a 35mm camera).
     For flash options, it has an automatic flash, red-eye reduction, a low-light option, and a slow-synch flash.
     This camera stores data in JPEG, TIFF and QuickTime file formats.  It stores info on a SmartMedia card (an 8MB card is included with a panorama function).  In terms of the number of images you can store on an 8MB card is 1 TIFF, 5 SQH and 16 HQ's.  The LCD panel is about 1.8 inches TFT and it runs on four AA NiCd, lithium or NiMH batteries; an AC adapter is included for when you download to a computer, do a slideshow on TV or print from your camera.  The software that I got when I bought this camera was an Olympus Camedia Master utility software program and Adobe PhotoDeluxe.  In my opinion, trash PhotoDeluxe and get yourself a nice copy of PhotoShop.  The biggest difference in &quot;Shop&quot; that &quot;Deluxe&quot; doesn't provide is the option to save into JPEG or TIFF formats (in other words, you can't post it on the web).  
     A few highlights for this camera is that it is designed for the photographer who wants an all-in-one camera with the ease of a point-and -shoot camera, including many automatic or manual controls (which are conveniently and easily activated and understood), like exposure, focus, white balance and flash.<br><br>
