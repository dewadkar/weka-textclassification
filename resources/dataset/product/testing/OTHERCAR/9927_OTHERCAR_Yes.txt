            I had an internal struggle with myself five years ago.  At the inexperienced age of 22, I needed to decide whether to hang on to my youth for as long as possible or step up to a new level of maturity.  

A little over five years ago, I was married less than a year and still felt youthful.  My high school graduation present, a faithful 1989 Mazda 323 Sports Edition, was ready for car heaven.  That wonderful little car saw me through the best and worst times of my life.  But at 175K miles and with very little maintenance performed on it during its stay with me, it was time to tearfully let go.  

For most of my teenage years, I lusted over the Mazda Miata.  Small, sporty, quick and cute...it was a reincarnated version of me in the automobile world.  Now was my chance to live an old dream.  I convinced a dealership to let me take a stunning white convertable $12,500 used Miata, with 25K miles on it, for a spin on my own.  They even let me drive it 35 miles west to show my mother, since she would be my co-signer for the loan, and to my husband at work for his opinions.

Mom and my husband had the same reaction, &quot;Its so small...what if you get into an accident?&quot;  They weren't very supportive and I could see their point but I STILL WANTED THAT CAR!  

I started to drive the 35 miles back to the dealership, contemplating on what to do.  I took a detour and drove the borrowed white Miata to another dealership, one mile west of its temporary home.  I perused through their Miata section and was approached by a salesman.  I pointed to my borrowed white Miata from their competition, with $12,500 written in white across the top of the windshield; I crossed my arms and said, &quot;What can YOU do for me?&quot;  The salesman, Ken, looked at me in astonishment and said that he had never seen anyone, who looked so passive on the outside, use a bargaining tactic so sneaky before.  

Ken helped me find a Miata, almost exactly the same as the white one except this one was red (even better!) and was only a year old with less than 7K miles on it.  They wanted $15,000 for it.  Hhhhmmmmm...what to do, what to do...pay more for the color red and less miles or go frugal?  I called Mom and my husband.  They were over in less than a half hour to help me.

My husband, claiming that he was worried about the Miata's size...I believe that he was more upset that he couldn't fit into the Miata) asked Ken what other used car on the lot he recommended that wouldn't stray too far from my taste. There was a black Nissan 240SX and a red Mazda MX-6 LS.  My narrow mind didn't like the Nissan; it looked generic.  However, I've always admired the MX-6 from afar but had never seen one up close before until that day.  It was appealing and captivated my interest.  Like a kindergartner with a new toy, I was temporarily side tracked.

The red 1993 Mazda MX-6 LS was in mint condition, even with the 35K that had been racked up by the previous owner.  The exterior had a smooth aerodynamic design with a spoiler in the end of the trunk (the spoiler makes an enormous difference in this car's exterior look.  Without it, it looks like a modified boring Ford Probe.)  Night driving, <i>pas avec</i> high beams, is brighter, thanks to the fog lights.  Cool soft-silver alloy rims, within the traditionally sports-car-wide tires, brought a tone of elegance and edge to the car's total appearance.

The MX-6's interior had firm but comfortable tan cloth seats(I stick to leather seats too much in the summer) with tiny flecks of red scattered sparsely throughout the cloth; interior perfectly matched the exterior.  The dash was well designed, simple and easy to read and informative.  Middle console, locking glove box and driver/passenger seat pouches provide plenty of storage space for manuals and odds and ends.  The security system provides adequate security (alarm, kill switch...this thing has stopped many thieves from successfully driving off in my car!)

The factory stereos, with its own security system, were more than adequate...with CD player, cassette, AM/FM stereo, and speakers (back, doors, and dash) produced excellent sound.  Another plus was the hand emergency break; I believe that pedal (foot) emergency breaks are best suited for larger class vehicles, i.e., vans, trucks, multi-purpose vehicles.  

The large spacious trunk had hidden compartments for a full-sized spare and jack with an instruction guide.  The back seats can fold down to create even more space.  

At the time, my husband had a brand new Eagle Talon Tsi with all the bells and whistles.  It was a nice car but this MX-6's ride was considerably better.  I've driven many sports cars, since I'm a sports car fanatic, and the suspension in this MX-6 beats a lot of them hands down, including the some of the exotic cars I've driven.  I wasn't jostled and couldn't feel every little bump in the road.  

This front-wheel drive MX-6 LS has good breaking response (discs all the way around) and surprisingly, can over take many cars in its 6-cylinder engine class during acceleration (sorry, can't state how I know that! :) )  The clutch shifts like a hot knife through butter, definitely the smoothest shifting I've ever done.  Steering is precise, easy and exceptional for a sports car, but it isn't the same as the 2000 Hyundai Sonata GLS, which is in the Camry and Accord class...the Sonata is luxury without the luxurious price.  (If you're interested in the Sonata, please see my &quot;highly recommended&quot; Sonata review in Epinions.)

Looking at the MX-6 put doubts in my mind about purchasing a Miata.  Driving the MX-6 shifted my views about purchasing a Miata...planning for my future family made me sign the papers for the MX-6!  Who can drive around comfortably and safely, with children, in a Miata?  I earned a stripe of maturity on my shoulder that day, an excellent car and an excellent deal (the dealership originally wanted $19,000 for my MX-6 but I talked them down to the red Miata's price of $15,000...this included my trade-in, which they were generous about during appraisal!  Ken said that they were all talking about me and my bargaining style for weeks.)

As it turns out, two months after I purchased the MX-6, I found out I was pregnant.  Funny how things work out, isn't it?  My daughter, now four, loves driving in the MX-6.  &quot;Go, Mommy!  Go!&quot; she often giggles from the backseat to get me to drive faster so the wind tossles her hair.  Of course, I never do when she's around.  There's never a quiet moment in the car either; there's always music jamming from the stereo, upon her request.

I've had my MX-6 for over five years now and she's still going strong.  During my occasional &quot;see what's new on the market&quot; car browsings, dealerships always ask me how much I want for my car and that they will buy it even when I tell them that I'm not looking to buy a car from them or anyone else.

Good-bye, dream Miata...or perhaps I'll see you in about ten years when I'm going through my mid-life crisis and have the need to rejuvinate my youth.

***I would like to state, for the record, that the picture Epinions uses for the MX-6 does not look like my car.  The only thing that resembles my car is the curvature in the hood.  That picture appears to be a picture of an older model, before the newest and last body design was out on the market.  FYI:  Ironically for me, the current sports car flagship of Mazda is now the Miata (a.k.a. MX-5).  The MX-6 was discontinued in 1997, sadly enough.<br><br>
