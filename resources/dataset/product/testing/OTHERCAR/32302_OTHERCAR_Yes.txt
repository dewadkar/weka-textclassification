            I'm a college student on a limited budget I think this would be a good car for anyone like me with a limited budget.  There are plenty of things that make this car a good choice but ill just cover the few things that helped me decide that this was the car for me.  Obviously the price which is about 13K was a good thing.  The car is fairly &quot;roomy&quot;, which is good for someone like me who is 6'1&quot;.  The back seat folds down leading to the truck which gives you more room to put all the stuff you take to college that will probably never really be needed. The gas mileage is excellent if kept in the overdrive position.  Finally, over the thanksgiving was fortunate enough to hit a dear with the sentra.  The damage was pretty bad but the in car CD player didnt skip!  The only thing that the car lacks is an engine and space in the back seats.  I got the 1.6L GXE model, although it is enough to keep the car going im not able to get any smokey burnouts.  (but they do make a 2.0L version)<br><br>
