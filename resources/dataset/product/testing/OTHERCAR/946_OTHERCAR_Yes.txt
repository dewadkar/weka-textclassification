            I bought my Kia used from an auto auction about 5 months ago and commute 130 miles a day in it.  Before I bought the car I went to the NHTSB and looked at registered complaints.  Something I recommend to anybody looking to buy any car.  Some of the common complaints: the dash curls up in the sun, the lap belt can be difficult to buckle, wears brakes out fast, engine dies when you stop.  Here's what I found with mine.  The dash was curled when I bought it, fixed with a pocket knife and a $30 dash mat.  I always  double check the lap belt when I buckle it, and it cost me $25 and took one hour to put new brake pads on(and the AutoZone around the corner had them in stock).  Mine also dies when you stop, but only if you downshift and use the engine brake.  There is some flaw in the computer that shuts off the fuel to assist in braking but it forgets to turn it back on unless you tap the throttle, so every time I stop, I tap the gas, no more problem.  The car is far from perfect, but my wife prefers it to the 95 Toyota Tercel she used to have.  The car is fairly quiet while running down the freeway when compared within its class, like the tercel (it ain't a Cadillac for sure).  My model doesn't have airbags, A/C or power anything, but I can drive it at 85 mph and still get 33 mpg, but I don't recommend any faster than 90 or so. At 65-70 it gets a lot closer to 40 mpg. The 1.8 liter motor has all the power I need to drive in SF Bay area hills and traffic.  The front seats are comfortable even after 1.5 to 2 hours, but the headroom is lacking.  I am 6'2" and 250# and rub my hair on the roof if I sit up straight.  I got what I expected  and then some when I bought my $2000 Kia, so I like it.  IF I wanted something extremely comfortable and roomy, I'd have bought a Thunderbird for $9000, but I need reliability and economy, so I bought a Kia.
