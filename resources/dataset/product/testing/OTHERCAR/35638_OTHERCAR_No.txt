            I bought this car about 5 years ago with just under 70,000 miles on it. On test drive everything seemed great. It had new struts and exhaust. Exterior and interior where clean. It had lots of power and handled nicely.

Then the ABS light came on, and it remains on to this day, because I got sick of trying to fix it. When it rains, water collects on the front floor. The controls are awkwardly laid out, and every button and knob feels cheap, like it's about to break. The automatic shifter lever is sloppy and doesn't indicate which gear you're in properly. The transmission makes a loud "clunk" noise when you put it into gear. The windows rattle when rolled down an inch or two. The back seats have no room. The trunk is almost small enough to be useless. There are no intermittent wipers on my car, and the wipers never worked very well, even with new blades. The brakes have also been problematic. The paint is peeling off. There have been dozens more problems with this car, but it's too much to list here.

Overall, it's a very cheap car. Everything just screams POOR QUALITY! I am a Quality Engineer, and I can't believe I didn't spot the poor quality when I test drove it. I learned my lesson. I'll never buy another GM product again!

The cars only saving grace is it's engine. The GM 3.1 L V6 is strong, reliable, and easy to maintain. At 134,000 miles, the engine is the only part of the car that isn't about to fall apart.
