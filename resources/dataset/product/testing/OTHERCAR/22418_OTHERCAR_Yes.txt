                 Up until recently for approximately 2 years I was the proud owner of a 1993 Toyota 4x4 pickup.  The vehicle was a 4cyl(22re) 5spd 4x4 with a push bar, fog lights, am/fm cassette, 31 x10.50 good year MT tires, and a bed liner in the famous Toyota Blue color with pin stripes up the sides of the vehicle from the front door jam to the tailgate.

      The vehicle is a great vehicle and I can honestly say that it never left me stranded. It is very dependable and the four wheel drive with lock out hubs is excellent. I line in New York and get a good amount of snow which this truck runs through without even coughing. It runs strong for a 4cyl and has suited and even surpassed my expectations in some areas.

      The only major issues I had with the truck was in October of 1999 6 yrs later at 100,000 miles the 4wd front cv joints and axles had to be replaced. And again at 102,000 miles in February 2000 I had to replace the starter.  The truck still runs strong and has had no other major issues. There has never been a single problem with the engine itself.

      The truck however is small inside so anyone who is looking for room, or requires room because of physical characteristics, may want to veer away from it. Other than this I have no other major issues to report about this vehicle. The rear bumper has started to rust and the tail gate after 8 yrs of road conditions including salt form snow storms. There is no other rust anywhere on the vehicle including the body. Anyone looking to for a ride like a car and comfort level of a car should steer away from any pickup.

     If you are in the market for a used truck this is the truck to get. It runs strong and is dependable. I have heard rumor that the V6 is not as dependable but I have no such facts to support it. A buddy of mine had one with a v6 that the body was falling apart and had almost 200,000 miles on it. The Toyota name speaks for itself and I have seen no reason not to believe in their dependability. But as far as looks goes the American manufactures definatly have cornered that end of the pickup market.
