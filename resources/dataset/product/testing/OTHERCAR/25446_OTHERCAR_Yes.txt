            Before I beging I have to say, I was impress. The volvo S80 was more than I expected, I am a car fan and perhaps freak. I research a lot about car and all my reviews will be about cars. And from all of the cars I have research this is it. The Volvo S80. Here is the luxury sedan that has turned heads all over the world. Powerful performance and indulgent comfort are its hallmarks. (I don't think I need to mention how safety is the #1 priority of Volvo) Yet it announces itself with the quiet good taste of a marque bred for distinction. There is nothing superficial about it. Beautifily executed, superbly crafted, the S80 clearly defines a level of luxury that approches art. And because it is a Volvo, its commitment to safety and engineering integrity is unsurpased. There is several models to choose from.

Models: 2.9, T6, Executive, Elite

Body Style: 4 door, 5-passenger, sunroof, non-sunroof

Drivetrain: Front-Wheel-Drive, 4-speed automatic, 4-speed "Geartronic" automatic

Engines: 6-cylinder DOHC
         Normally aspirated:197hp
         High Pressure Twin Turbo: 268hp

During the time I drove this car I did as a rental car. It left a mark in my heart I drove the T6 and it handles like a truly luxury/Sport car. Soft and comfortable yet agile and with lots of grips for that tights curves. I strongly recomend this car for anyone looking for safety and a very reliable car. This car offers luxury and safety with performace with a affordable price compare to its competitors.  The ride is so soft, and the seats are great and the leather feels like right out of a rolls royce interior. The crafmantship and feel of the interior is so perfectly built and it feels like a six figure price car.
