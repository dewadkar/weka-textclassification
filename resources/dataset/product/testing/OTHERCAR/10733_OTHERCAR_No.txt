            When my wife finally succumbed to her SUV bug, we went to check out several models. The first one we looked at was the brand new tribute. It looked nice, and was comfortable to sit in. The problem came when we drove it. I sat in the back seat while my wife drove. I felt every bump we hit. I asked the salesperson if the chassis was based off a car or truck. I had heard it was based off the 626 chassis. He said it was made especially for the tribute. We own a 94 626 and I love it, it drives much more smoothly than the tribute. I would not be able to drive this vehicle on extended trips. Other SUV's we drove felt and drove much better. 
The vehicle was comfortable when sitting still. The stereo sounded good. Braking and acceleration were also good. This may very well be a good vehicle, in a few years when they get all the kinks out. The first year of a new design always has a few flaws that are worked out during production of the next years model. Another real life problem is the fact that it is a new model. Mazda has no sales incentives. No rebates. No special interest rates. Many people don't realize how much lower thier payment is due to these incentives. Mazda could not get the vehicle down into the payment range we expected for this priced vehicle.
We ended up buying a Honda CRV. It was a superior vehicle, a proven design, and cost much less.<br><br>
