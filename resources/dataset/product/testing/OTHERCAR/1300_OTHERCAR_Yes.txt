            i don't actually own our 97 SR5 4RUNNER, it's my parents' car (i'm 16..)...  but now that i'm driving around, i feel it's a great pleasure to drive our &quot;monster&quot; (our family's affectionate term for it) around the mean streets of LOS ANGELES.  and here's why:

1.  no matter how great this car seems, IT'S STILL AN SUV.  but who says that SUV's aren't great cars???  it handles, drives, looks, feels, and just costs like all the other japanese-made SUV's out there.  when we first checked out SUV's, we looked at the HONDA PASSPORT, NISSAN PATHFINDER, AND FORD EXPLORER.  we gave up on the explorer because our test drive wasn't such a great one.  the pathfinder was great, just as great as the 4runner.  the passport wasn't so great, despite us having a honda at that time.  my point is that IT'S A VERY ATTRACTIVE CAR

2.  it's a little bit expensive (even though i don't pay for the lease), at about 35,000 for the SR5 model.  to give you an idea of what this price range can get you, you can get for a very little increase in price a MERCEDES ML430, LEXUS RX300, and FORD EXPEDITION.  but i'm glad we stuck with our 4runner

3.  the features aren't EXCEPTIONAL, but you feel that every dollar you spent on this car is actually worth it.  the air conditioning works seemingly as fast as a blink of an eye (i've seen range rovers take a while for a.c.).  the radio is really nice and clear sounding, and it comes pre-wired for a cd changer or mini-disc player.

if you get a 4runner, get the SR5 because it's the perfect balance of price and features.  the base level is almost like riding a tricycle in terms of features, the limited edition is just way too expensive.  ours came with cruise control, which is very easy to operate on this car compared to others.

4.  this car isn't too big of a gas guzzler, only because we have the 6 cylinder version.  it provides great power and acceleration, but isn't too biting out of the gas tank.

5.  i've been in all seats of the car since we got it (back seats, passenger seat, and now the driver's seat), and each one is comfortable (despite it being cloth seats).

6.  i must admit that the one thing i'm not to fond of is the location of the cup holders.  the one in the rear seat is perectly located, but the front holder is placed about 1 1/2 inches away from the steering wheel.  this can be a problem during parallel parking, u-turns, and left turns.  my mom is NOT a big person, in fact she's about 5'3 and 120 lbs, yet she hits her hand almost every time on the cup holder when we have it out.

7.  the rear window is PERFECT in terms of functionality and ease of use.  it can be operated WHILE driving because it is located right next to you; it can also be operated from the outside using your key and turning it in the keyhole on the rear gate.  most SUV's require you to be outside to use it.

THE ALL IMPORTANT FACT:

we take care of our 4runner very much so since our purchase 3 years ago.  regular oil changes, regular car washes, etc.  we haven't been on time on our tire rotations and alignments, yet i don't feel very obligated to.  i mean the car is VERY WELL MADE!  if you get one, assuming it is used and decently maintained, your visits to the repair shop will be as frequent as about every year (for major check ups).  and the repair bill isn't very much either.  man i love toyota!

if you have any more questions or feel that i excluded something important, send me an email and i'll definitely include it.
