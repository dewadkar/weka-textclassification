              I purchased my 1999 Dodge 1500 ST 4x2 in November of '98 and have driven the truck daily to work as well as extended interstate travel.  To my enjoyment the best part of the whole truck is large comfortable seats in a very roomy cab, despite being a standard cab truck. Due to this room, the smart buyer will ensure that their Dodge will come with power locks, mirrors, (and to a lessor extent) windows.  My truck has full gage set which are all easy to read and understand.  The rest of the interior is based on simplicity with a large fold-down center backrest for storage and cup holders that will hold any size cup you will get in a drive-thru. A key activated switch will turn off the passenger side airbag in case you need to use a child seat. 
  The drivetrain is a 5.2 liter (318 cubic inches) V8 with a 4 speed automatic transmission. The engine is smooth and affords good power but it can be thirsty when it comes to city driving.  I have experienced fuel mileage as low as 12 driving in traffic or just short hops to and from work, and as high as 20 on long interstate driving (speed average was 80 mph).  Surprisingly the truck was well suited for interstate travel since a speed of 75 mph will set the engine approximately 2200 rpms. The transmission has a smooth shift but tends to put the truck in higher gears too soon. I have experienced the transmission shifting into overdrive while traveling at only 35 mph. While this does help the fuel economy, it is annoying.  Engine maintenance is easy since the engine bay is large and all maintenance items are not covered up with vacuum lines or other non-essential accessories.
  Finally, the ride. With power steering and brakes, the truck is not the handful you would think it is.  My 5'4&quot; wife has driven it around town and never felt a lack of control over the truck, but refers to getting in the truck as a &quot;climbing expedition&quot;.  We do agree that the right front corner is hard to see and occasionally causes us to hold our breath when parking at a crowded mall.  The ride is good for a truck but the rear shocks and solid rear axle don't react well to potholes or abrupt maneuvers.  The front shocks are a little too soft and will bounce if you hit a speed bump too fast. Let's face it, its a truck.
  In retrospect, as much as I like the truck, I should have bought something smaller. If you plan to haul a lot of stuff all the time or require a truck your going to spend a lot of time in it, this is for you.  If you just occasionally need something haul this, that or the other, check out the Dakota.   <br><br>
