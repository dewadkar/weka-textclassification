            I am the not-so-proud owner of a 1996 Dodge Neon. I bought this car as my first car, hoping that if I bought a cheap new car I wouldn't have the worries of breaking down while at college that a used car comes with. I figured a new car should get me through 4 years of school without any headaches. I was DEAD wrong.  With nothing in the car and a cash-back from the dealer around the time I bought the car, it was an affordable collegestudent car.  However, I have had my problems with it.

Exactly 3 years and a week from when I bought the car, (so that conveniently my warranty had just ran out)... the transmission on my car blew while I was away for spring break.  Very convenient, and very expensive for a college student to be dealing with.  Luckily, after a nasty conversation with Dodge, they did cover the car.  But I was still stuck without a way to get to school for a week.  

Not more than 8 months later, my car started leaking oil.  It turns out that the head gasket in Neons were designed wrong, and that they warp, leaking oil.  This time Dodge wouldn't cover their mistake, and I was stuck paying 700 dollars to fix a car that I bought.  For a car that I bought with the intention of saving a little money and having the conveniences of a new car, I could have just bought a cheap used one.<br><br>
