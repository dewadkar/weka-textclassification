            Late last March I decided I needed a new ride before I transferred to another job.   As I was shopping around, I took a quick peek at a 2001 Sonoma 4-door truck.   Now I'm a country boy that owned an extended cab Ford F-350 with the powerstroke and was having some issues on bringing myself to buy a compact truck.  For one the bed of the Sonoma was tiny.  I think I could fit one standard sized bookcase in the bed, and that was it.   But the bed was the only main concern I could say I had about the truck.  I took it for a test drive and was impressed from the very beginning.   The ride was unbelievably smooth for a truck.  I also test drove a 2000 Cadillac STS just for giggles and I'm not going to say that the Sonoma drove just as nice as the Caddy, but it wasn't far off.   

The interior room of the 4-door Sonoma actually compares to some of the SUV's that I've been in.  The Toyota 4-Runners don't have near as much leg room in the back seat as my truck does.   The V-6 that is under the hood, proves to be a decent running engine.   Now don't get my wrong, my old powerstroke Ford was an old goat that had the guts to pull just about anything.   My Sonoma is just a little goat that can pull what I need it to pull and still do pretty well on gas mileage.   

I currently live in the mountains of Colorado, and I haven't had to drive during the dead of winter yet, but I'm pretty confident that my Sonoma will get me around quite well.   So far, it's the best vehicle I've had the privilege to drive.
