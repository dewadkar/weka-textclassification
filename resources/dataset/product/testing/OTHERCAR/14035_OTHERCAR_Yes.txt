            I went out looking for a used car for a poor college student.  This was going to be my first car.  I found a '98 Sunfire with a few bells and whistles, but nothing special.  All I needed was a reliable car that would fit me and at least 2 or 3 other people comfortably.  It was perfect for the price and even had the CD player I direly needed.  I took it for a test drive and was very impressed by the smoothness of the ride.  This car provides a very fun driving experience and puts you in the seat of a car that looks nice and rides nice.  For a compact car, this car is ideal.  The features are great such as Traction control, the sound system, big glove box, middle storage compartment, and even cup holders.  The car is easy to maintain with updated oil changes.  I have put over 10,000 miles on this car in 5 months driving it from California to Oregon (through the mountains) many times.  Still, I have no complaints, but I also still have fun driving it.  It is ideal for anyone looking for reliable transportation, but also looking to have fun.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple compact car for them and a few friends.<br><br>
