            We purchased our silver 98 beetle for list price, and were able to negotiate a bit of a break on the CD player. Other than that, all list. Of course, at the time, the car was so hot that many were paying a substantial (like $1500+) premium. My wife was in love with the car so we paid cash.

We purchased only after checking with the most deceptive dealerships I have ever dealt with. This applied to several of our local dealerships (esp. Gensinger Motors in Clifton)as well as to those in Alexandria, VA. (Ray Burnette). Both dealerships lied outright in response to specific questions (in stock, current price) solely in order to get me in the door. WHen I placed the order with Gensinger the car was 6 weeks late and when I wrote VW regional office to complain, the manager claimed to have offered cars that I had turned down.

That said, I've been pleased with the car itself.

High points: style, handling, overall quality is quite good. Better than I had expected in a new design in the first year.

Several minor issues: 

The hatchback release broke the very first time we used it -- right in the dealer lot the day we purchased. THey fixed it within an hour and no problems since.

The radio/CD suffers quite badly from electrical interference. I've asked the dealer about this and they've said, in essence, that it "happens sometimes and there's not much to be done about it." I've heard that other folks have had problems with electrical but this is the only issue that's occurred to me.

So, overall I'm pleased with the car, but VERY disappointed with VW dealerships. 

Hope my description of my experience helps!
