            Being a bargain hunter by nature, I wasn't able to resist picking up a Polaroid Photomax fun! 620 camera when I saw it at a discount store on sale for $39.00 Cdn.  Already being the owner of a digital camera, I was interested in what this camera had to offer in comparison to the one I already had, since it was only a small fraction of the cost.

Upon opening the package, I was impressed with the flexibility that this camera "kit"  had to offer.  It is compatible with both serial ports, and USB ports on a PC.  This was a nice feature, since it is getting harder and harder to find a less expensive unit with serial cables instead of USB compatibility .  This would be useful if the computer you were wanting to use with this is an older one.  The included software is very easy to use, giving the ability to edit, resize, and enhance photos.  Nothing more is needed after buying this kit - all necessary accessories are included.  The only two things that would be handy would be a case for the camera, and possibly rechargeable batteries - this will save A LOT of money in the end.

Using this camera is a breeze!  All that you need to do is point and shoot.  Because this camera has no flash, a considerable amount of light is needed in order to take a good picture. A  "low light"  indicator appears on the frame counter on the back of the camera to let you know if more light is needed.  If there is low light, a picture can still be taken, but the user has to keep the camera still after pushing the shutter button for a few seconds to ensure the photo turns out.  The shutter stays open for a longer period in low light situations, so even small movements can "blur" the photo. After some practice, this no longer becomes a factor.

The Polaroid 620 has 1Mb internal memory storage, able to hold about 15 photos.  There is no provision for external memory storage (Flash card, Smart Media), so this is a great unit for short trips, or for the occasional photos. Look at other models with larger storage, or with the ability to have external storage media if you want to use a digital camera as a substitute for a traditional film camera.  This unit is especially handy for taking pictures to e-mail to family and friends, or for a work application, needing to take a few shots here and there.  Print quality is not as good as other units, due to its lower resolution.

Overall, this camera is a great value for the beginner, or for a compact, handy unit for taking the occasional picture to e mail to friends.  At the price that it sells for, this is definitely the answer for family use, without breaking a budget.  Overall construction quality is good, and the camera delivers on all that it promises to do.  The Photomax kit provides all that you need to get started, the only accessory to consider would be rechargeable batteries, to save some money in the long run.  Customer support is excellent, with the manufacturer providing a user friendly website to refer to with any questions. Definitely pick one up if you see one, This camera gets used a lot more than expected, especially without the worry of losing or breaking a really expensive unit!
