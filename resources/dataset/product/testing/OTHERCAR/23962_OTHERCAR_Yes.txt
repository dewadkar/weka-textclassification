            The shiny black bus in our garage is now the fourth that I have owned. After seeing the price drop dramatically in 2002 and the engine horsepower increased I decided to take a test drive and instantly fell in love with the beast and with the German craftsmanship that had missing from my automobiles since the last bus I owned almost ten years ago. Ours has the weekender package with pop-top roof, fold-down table and rear seat, and a little fridge under the seat that you could barely squeeze a six-pack into. The weekender package also includes a second battery and heavy duty alternator to handle the extra draw from accessories that you might use while camping. The interior is plush gray velour and very well put together, the gray curtains let you completely shut out the outside world including front windscreen for overnighting. The van does have noticeably heavy doors, designed it seems for burly damen und herren. I have managed to confuse the locking mechanism sometimes so that you have to lock the rest of the doors before you can open the rear hatch. Fold down the rear seat and you can (barely) fit 8x4 sheets of drywall inside. The side windows on the weekender can slide open and have bug screens, a nice addition. Most noticeable is the amount of room in this beast. You really can have a party in the back of this thing, especially if you open up the roof.

The van drives very well considering it's size. The throttle is rather touchy at low speeds giving you the impression that there's a bunch of horses under the hood, which there really aren't, but overtaking at high speed is actually very good when you consider the mass of metal you are trying to move. The suspension is very firm and the low profile tires make even little bumps quite noticeable. It is at it's best when cruising at 75mph on the interstate and really is a pleasure to drive long distance with good seats, armrests and fantastic visibility. It still inherits the tendency to get blown around in strong wind and the pop-top roof whistles a bit. On some very steep twisty roads in Colorado and with several people on board I noticed the gearbox had trouble deciding what gear to be in and was rather jerky changing from one to the other. Volkswagen at least got their brakes figured out finally - the four wheel ABS disks stop this tank in an instant.

Yes, this is still a little underpowered, still has a quirky gearbox that you'd think Volkswagen would have got right by now, the wind still whistles through the pop-top roof but despite it's little deficiencies, this is still a VW bus at heart and such deficiencies somehow manage to become charming nuances. Definitely a fun van to own and drive.
