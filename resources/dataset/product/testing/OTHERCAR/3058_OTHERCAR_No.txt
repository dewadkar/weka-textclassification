            <b>DISCLAIMER** <i>The following review was written five months after purchasing our</i> <b>1996 Dodge Intrepid</b> <i>brand new.  After seven and a half years of ownership, I have included some</i> IMPORTANT UPDATES <i>to this review in order that consumers can make a wiser buying decision on this vehicle</i></b>.

<b>~Please read UPDATES at the conclusion of this review</b>

<i>After owning a vast variety of automobiles of different sizes, makes and models, I must declare that the Dodge Intrepid is, by far, the best vehicle that I have ever owned!!  I base this opinion on several key factors, including roominess, speed, power, safety and ease of handling.

When my husband and I married in the winter of 1996, my 1989 Subaru was on its way out!!  Everything had gone wrong with this car and finally it was time for a new transmission.  Being the financial wizard that he is, my husband strongly suggested not throwing more good money after bad.  He felt that it was time for a newer, safer, more reliable automobile and suggested that I allow him to purchase  a Dodge vehicle for me and my children.  My husband had only purchased Dodge automobiles in the  past and swore by them. Well, how could I resist an offer like this?!  A new husband,a new marriage AND a new car!!  What more could a girl want?!

So off to the dealerships we went.  I was forewarned not to speak to the salesman!  We went to the Dodge dealership with certain options, colors and requirements in mind.  What we finally signed a sales agreement for, was much more than either of us had hoped for.  We ended up with a fully loaded, fully powered, Orchid (purple) colored, sporty, roomy car!!  Whew!!  I was in heaven.

We have the <b>1996 Dodge Intrepid ES 3.5</b> engine which offers a more powerful ride.  Anti-lock brakes and traction control are added safety features.  I insisted on the top shelf stereo system since I am an ardent music lover.  I own both compact disks and audio cassettes, therefore we ordered a system with both!  The more speakers the better, so our car has 11 in total!!  Air conditioning is a must when traveling with children on long family trips.  The automatic power seats have several options and can be adjusted several different ways. The driver seat as well as the passenger's seat is adjustable!  This allows for my husband, who is shorter than I am, to adjust the seat higher and  more frontward for a more comfortable ride.  My passengers have the same option.  

Since we travel a great deal, a very roomy trunk was a must.  The enormous trunk space can fit several large suitcases and has lots of room for just about anything teenagers can throw in there to take on a weekend trip!  

Of course, we had to have dual air bags!  Shortly before my marriage, I was involved in am auto accident.  I was the passenger and did not have an airbag.  I was injured severely and the driver walked away, unharmed.  I believe in learning from experiences like this one.  I would highly recommend dual airbags for added safety.

There are always down sides no matter how wonderful a product may seem.  Consumers Digest had highly rated the <b>1996 Dodge Intrepid</b>.  However, there was not much wrong with it at the time.  We had an extended warranty, therefore, the few things that did need repair were fully covered.  This included, a new water pump, rack and pinion steering and air conditioning adjustment.</i>

<i>Final Thoughts and Recommendations</i>

...<i>Overall, I would not be ranting over this car if I was not highly satisfied with it. This Dodge automobile suits my family's needs perfectly. It is roomy and safe.  It has speed and endurance!</i> <b><i>What more could one ask for??</i></b>

<b>**UPDATE** **WARNING** UPDATE **WARNING** **UPDATE**</b> 

If my husband and I were in the market today for a used vehicle, the <b>1996 Dodge Intrepid</b> would fall no where on our list of perspective cars!!  We have warned many of our friends and my husband's co-workers NOT TO INVEST ONE CENT into the <b>Dodge INTREPIDS built back in 1996</b>.

It continues to amaze us, how much money we have invested in maintaining ownership of our once prized possession.  In fact, between January 2002 and June 2003, my husband has dropped a whopping <b>$2100.00</b> on dear old <i>Betsy</i>!!

There are much better used vehicles on the market today from the same year that the <b>1996 Dodge Intrepid</b> was manufactured.  <b>I strongly suggest looking elsewhere</b> for your next automobile, steering clear of this make and model.

..<b>As you can clearly see, my family has spent far too much money on parts and labor on things that should never have gone wrong on a vehicle that as of this date (September 18, 2003) has only 62,000 miles on it. Almost from the moment that we began driving this <b>1996 Dodge Intrepid</b>, systems began to fail and parts that rarely need replacing, had to be replaced.</b>


Sadly, the name <b><i>INTREPID</i></b> no longer stands for the once bold and beautiful vehicle that I thought that it was.  <b>It is not a reliable and quality automobile.</b>  We have been stranded, waiting by the side of roads to be towed in, on four distinct issues.  The towing costs have not even been figured into the overall amount of out of pocket cash that we have paid to own this vehicle.  


For this disappointed owner<b><i>INTREPID=TROUBLE</i></b>!!
