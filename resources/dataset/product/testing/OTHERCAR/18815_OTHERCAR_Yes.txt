            I bought a brand new 1998 4WD, 6 cylinder, 4.0 litre Jeep Cherokee Classic, because I was so impressed with my previous base model 2 door, 2WD drive manual transmission 1992 Cherokee.  This vehicle has all the options except leather interior and the factory up-country suspension package although I have had an after market tow package installed.  Note: had I known I would have paid for the up-country package because by the time you add up an after market lift kit, tow hooks, skid plates and tow package including radiator, it is more expensive than the factory option.  

The first problem I noticed with my Jeep was its instability on wet roads but that was easily remedied by purchasing new tires, Bridgestone Dueler ATs.

The latter problems have been a source of concern for me.  Firstly, the driver's side power window ceased to work.  The problem being the power regulator.  Although the motor in the regulator was perfectly good, a small plastic clip had broken.  Unfortunately, Jeep nor any other manufacturer, does not sell just this clip!  One has to buy a whole new regulator for around $180, $365 installed at the dealer.  After trying to manufacture my own clip I succumbed to purchasing a used regulator and installing it myself.

Secondly, suddenly the windshield wipers refused to return to the "down" position and would stop wherever they were on the windshield...almost as if the ignition had been turned off without first shutting the wipers off.  This was diagnosed to be a problem with the wiper motor relay.  Again, the motor within the unit was perfectly good, but one can not just have the relay repaired or replaced.  The cost of a new wiper motor $138, $289 installed at the dealer.  I bought a used one for $35.              

I never had any problems with the 1992 Cherokee, which leads me to believe that the more options one has, the more likely it is that parts will fail.  However, this vehicle is not even three years old, has been babied and garaged.  I expected more from Jeep and am a little disappointed.

Overall, I still like and would recommend the Jeep Cherokee.  I like the utilitarian feel, the stiff suspension, and the handling.  In the future, I will probably trade this one in for the new Jeep Liberty.  Hopefully, I'll have better luck.
