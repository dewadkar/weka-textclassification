            The VW Passat is quite an automobile. While it may be out of reach for the average family car shopper, those able to spend a couple extra thousand should. I had the chance to test drive this car about a year ago, but ended up buying another vehicle because since I am quite a tall guy, I need something with more interior room. I drive my friend's Passat often though.

This car gives its corporate sibling, the Audi A4, some real competition. In fact, I think the A4 is a poor value considering you can obtain a fully loaded Passat V6 for much much less than you can get the 2.8 A4. And the Passat might just be a better car. 

Everything about this car is quite positive. The exterior is beautiful. For me, simplicity is everything. Color matching does wonders for the Passat, as I personally favor the black. The interior is laid out quite well. My main complaint is head room, which is lacking for a guy who is 6'5&quot;. The dash is very nice, and the speedometer and all that stuff is laid out nicely, numbers are clean, there seems to be no congestion. The audio system is pretty good. The seats are supportive, and room in the back is acceptable. The interior yells quality. Plastics are rare. Materials are made of quality components. The cupholder is a joke though. If you like taking turns over 5mph, then the drink will probably spill. The interior is designed very well, as it shares a number of things with the A4, especially the &quot;ambiance&quot;.

Performance is lacking from the 4 cylinder. At a base of 19,800, the Passat ain't cheap. You can get a V6 from all domestic automobiles in this price range, and a number of japanese automakers include a V6 at this price as well. Acceleration is ok, but you expect better at this price range. The optional V6 on the other hand is amazing. Acceleration is smooth and quiet. &quot;Wow! I am at 60 already?&quot; I can't understate how quiet the engine is. The ride is ok....not as smooth as a Camry, similar to an Accord...perhaps a bit rougher/sportier. Hnadling characteristics are excellent on the Passat. It takes sharp turns very well, even at high speeds. Brakes are excellent as well. There is very little to complain about the Passat's V6 package. Add the optional engine to an already exception suspension, you have one amazing handling sports...ahem...family car.

Reliability has been an issue with my friend though. The transmission experienced some odd shifting...it couldn't get the 2nd gear in place. This was repaired by VW under warranty. Electrical components would fail...all fixed by VW. And the A/C struggles to keep up with the amazingly hot Miami sun. Once the car is rolling though the AC does fine, just hope you aren't at a long red light. Otherwise the car has been a blast for both my friend and I to drive.<br><br>
