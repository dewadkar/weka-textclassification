            I had written a previous epinion about how much I loved my 2000 LS8, that was until I heard about Lincolns losing tires and other Firestone Blowouts or throwing treads, non-SUV's.  Lincoln will not allow you past their &quot;800 #&quot; operators.  They suggest checking with Dealer and Firestone, but it would be Lincoln involved in litigation, not the Dealer and not Firestone.

On a attempts to circumvent the &quot;Do Nothing&quot; &quot;800 #&quot; Operators, all other telephone numbers are &quot;being checked on&quot; (out of order).  The &quot;800 #&quot; Operators claim they do not the President / CEO of Ford Motor Company and have no phone numbers to provide, &quot;Hey, if the wheels blow out, at least you died in a Lincoln&quot;.

This my Last Lincoln and I will never buy any other vehicle with Firestone Tires.  Do not assume because of the name they stand behind their product, they do not!

The lesson learned, stay with Toyota or Lexus.<br><br>
