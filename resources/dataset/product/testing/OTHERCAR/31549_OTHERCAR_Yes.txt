            It all started my senior year in college when I got my first car, a 1986 Volvo sedan. This car was soon to teach me the pangs and ecstasy of a serious relationship. As a college student I loved the roominess of my car as, with some effort, my ten closest friends and I could places together. It was also great for moving my junk back and forth from home. 
Secondly, the quality and safety of Volvos really are as good as people claim; I was in two small accidents since I got my Volvo (neither of them my fault of course) and both times no one was hurt and my car sustained minimal damage. They really are tanks, so just be careful of the people out there driving Geo Metros, they don't stand a chance.
Volvos are reliable and relatively fast cars for their completely unaerodynamic shape. They also last forever! I mean it, this is a car to use and then later watch your grandkids go to the prom in. My Volvo had over 100,000 miles on it when I got it and that was three years ago. It's still going strong.
My car is a stick shift and I also love that aspect of the car, as you feel like you are being a better more aware driver because you are forced to concentrate on your speed, or excess of.
These are the highs, the joyous, sweet moments of true love when you wish you could kiss your Volvo ( if not for the looks the neighbors would give you).
Now, the lows, the heart-wrenching times when you want to grovel in front of your Volvo's grate and wail, &quot;why me, why are you doing this to me?&quot;
Volvo parts cost so much you might have to promise the mechanic your first born in exchange for them. Everything, and I mean everything, down to the little plastic cup holders, has to be from the Volvo factory in Sweden. I have had to buy two new tail lights, a new muffler, and a new clutch and I thought I might have to borrow money from my 10 year old cousin to get them. But, remember, those parts will last a long time and perhaps save you money in the long run.
Volvos are heavy cars, good in accidents, not good on gas mileage. Although, I have heard that newer models aren't nearly as bad.
In the long run the negatives are far outweighed by the positives and an added bonus is people giving you respect on the road and at the mechanic. They always give the car a glance and say &quot;Volvo huh? Those tanks last forever don't they?&quot; And you can nod and smile knowing they will be a little less likely to mess with you.
As for who should buy the car, almost anyone. Just be prepared for the agonies and the ecstasies. This is a car for romantics, a car for people who name all their cars. It is not a car for people who simply want to get from one place to another. If that's all you want then buy an Accord and join the mass of Americans giving up on cars with personality. The best part about Volvos is you can find one in your price range. If you can afford the 40,000$ new Volvo's go for it but if not an 80's classic like this one will only be a couple thousand and well worth it.
Just remember what I said, it isn't a relationship for the faint of heart. <br><br>
