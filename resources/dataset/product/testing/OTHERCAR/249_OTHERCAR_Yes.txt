            Finally a camera that make digital photography as easy as any point and shoot camera.  Its photo quality makes 35mm sharp 8x10s and has pro features that any camera buff would love.  I bought this product after extensive review of Nikon, Fuji, Agfa, and many others.  In every respect it out weights the pack in ease of use, quality and it solid metal case is very ergonomic.

Features like remote control enables you to work the camera in hard to reach areas and set it up in places to capture scene and un-rehearse actions of your subjects.

From short movie clips, white balance controls, shutter speeds and aperture controls, clear images from its stock 3x zoom, you get a point and shoot to a pro-camera all in one.

Lens attachments like wide angle and telephoto lens, plus a high capacity IBM storage unit, allows you a full range of creative and portable accessories to make this camera a superior choice to any digital camera out there today.  In addition I like the internal rechargeable battery.

A 3.3 Million pixel with a range of functions and accessories at the price point of their competitors puts the Canon G1 #1<br><br>
