                  This is a great car, it combines beauty and power and so much more.
Driving this car is like being re-born into Hulk Hogan's body. It's 450hp
of true American beast. I love the looks of this car and it always turns heads around town. If your into music, don't buy a convertible. The massive V-10 will drown out the two 8's like nothing. The Viper is without a doubt the best priced exotic car in it's class. Other than the Cobra, no other car has stunned so many people with it's sexy lines and brute strength. I love mine and I have never wished for a different car.
