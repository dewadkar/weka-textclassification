            This is an unwieldy "Jerk" amongst today�s IT cameras. 

Powerful? YES! Capable? YES! Slow? YES! Most of all you will notice the quirky "look" and downright wierd design shell in particular the placements of controls. Yes, all of Sony�s ergonomic specialist must have been away on holiday during THIS development. 

For example, I can't get my finger to the "joystick" control when I hold it to my eye because my nose rests smack on it! I have actually managed to access the menus using my "beak" instead. This is a "hidden feature": -the SONY "beak-controlled menu". At least SONY has not yet advertised it as: "Sniff out all Sony�s new babble babble"

More examples: The auto/manual focus button that I often use is IDENTICAL and next to the steady-shot on/off that I seldom change. Thanks to my trusty DREMEL 20,000 rpm drill they are no longer confusable to my "finger-spits".

The shutter-button is recessed and therefore hard to find in a hurry. A nice little "blob" of self-curing adhesive acrylic fixed that for good... Also severe problems with the "manual" exposure controls that I can only find if I can see them (!), so forget adjusting exposure manually with the camera to your eye. Unfortunately these controls are just too tiny to fix with drill or acrylic �blob�.... 
The three-pod screw is laughable so use the camera handheld...

However, I a very happy that I can use 2-3 disks "simultaneously" for different types of pictures like work, sport and family. It takes no time to change disks as required, and no need to fill one disk before you change as with film. Only Hasselblad offer this with it's "famous" replaceable film cassettes. However, the properties like exposure does of course not change as with different film speeds...

The fact the CD is not rewritable-compatible does not worry me one bit as long as "crook" pictures can be deleted (with lost disk-space) at the low-low cost of each 8cm CD disks... and no need to muck around with cables and software, just pop the disk in the computer drive and ENJOY a full screen of image pleasure!!! Here on the computer is were I do the picture adjustments and size cropping. 

The camera provides the option of "digital zoom" for the many silly "Jerks" amongst its users. There is no such thing as a "digital zoom" really, it's actually an "in camera frame-cropping" that may just save a bit of cheap disk-space. Why would you pay good money for a Hi-Res pickup of 2-3 million pixels and then only use a 30% in the middle with this silly "zoomey" camera cropping? Only Jerks use the digital zoom option and it's a shame its there on a camera with such good optics like on this SONY product. Forgetaboutit!

Next model needs BIGGER controls logically arranged and a non-slip ergonomic rubber ring around the lens. Also a standard flash shoe for "standard" photoflashes and/or a ring-flash would be really wonderful. 
Yes, the inbuilt pop-up flash can best be described as a practical joke if you use it for any macro situation. Ha ha ha, very funny! You Sony people really know to enjoy the Japanese brand of humor. Guess I'm lucky to be spared the surprice cockroaches...

This camera sets a bewildering "world-record" for poorly executed human design in conjunction with a really good brand-new revolutionary concept! I bet a German or Dutch brand would not commit such careless sloppy "crime" or...
