            I've had the Konica KD-400Z for 15 months (purchased September 2002). At the time, my goal was a small 4mp camera that I could stick in my pocket or on my hip.

I went to a camera store to buy the Olympus D-40. However, I saw the Konica, and asked to touch it. It felt so much better in my hand, that I had to go back home to review it. A very good site is Steve's Digicams (http://www.steves-digicams.com/2002_reviews/kd400z_qtvr.html) This gives a review along with many pictures of the camera itself.

Size
I had already decided that I wanted something small. I also knew that I wanted a 4mp camera, in case I needed to enlarge over 8x10. The Konica fits in my breast pocket, although I always keep the included strap around my neck in case I bend over.

Battery
The Konica uses an internal battery. Fully charged, it lasts about 100 pictures as long as they don't all require a flash. The Olympus takes standard AA (or AAA?) batteries. The only time this comes into play is if a) you forget to charge the battery; or b) the charge runs out and you're out in public. With the Olympus, you can always run to the corner drug store and pick up more batteries.

Output
Unlike the Olympus, it does NOT have a connection direct
only to TV. You'll need to use a card reader or upload the images to the computer and transfer to CD/DVD. It does come with a USB cable to connect to your PC.

Ready Time:
One of the best features is the speed at which this camera gets ready for its first picture. Many digital cameras take close to 60 seconds. The Konica is ready in 2-3 seconds! Note: it still takes at least 5 seconds between pictures, to allow the camera to write the image to the memory card. 

Picture Quality
The picture quality for outdoor/daylight shots is great. Indoor shots using the flash are good, but not great. Outdoor shots using the flash are fair to poor (such as an outdoor but fully lit stadium at night).

Memory Card
This is a little strange, but this camera takes both SD cards as well as Sony MemoryStick cards (simultaneously). This allows you to effectively double the number of pictures that you take without having to swap cards or cleaning one off.

Recommendations
1. Make sure to touch all of the cameras that you are considering. If it does not feel good in your hand, you will resent your purchase.

2. Decide the primary purpose of the camera - snap shot vs. something fancier. You can save a lot of money if you don't need the extra features.

3. Get at least a 256MB card. I took the kids to Disney World for three days, and took over 300 pictures. I didn't have to worry about changing cards or swapping film cannisters, because I had a 256MB SD card, and a 256MB MemoryStick card.

4. If you will never create an enlargement &gt; 8x10, consider a 3mp. Otherwise, don't go for smaller than 4mp.
