            Let the initial depreciation wear off and buy a used Nissan Pathfinder SE 4x4.  I did, and it's the best car decision I've ever made.  

The repair history is virtually non-existent, the styling has remained &quot;in style&quot;, and the performance specs still stack up with the best in the class today.  

I bought a 1996 fully loaded SE 4x4 and here's what I got:

- The powerful V6 has had no problems towing large loads (5000 lb horse trailer with 1000 lb horse). 

- The acceleration is average, but acceptable for an SUV. 

- Cornering falls into the same category as acceleration.  

- The interior styling is luxurious and buying used allowed me to get the complete package with sunroof, towing package, cd player, on-the-fly suspension selection, and much more.  

If you like a real &quot;trucky&quot; ride this car won't be your choice, but if you're like most suburbanites, or young college grads, and you want an SUV but don't want to pay an outrageous price for a truck....a used Pathfinder is the choice to make.  It's smooth, it's stylish, it's reliable.<br><br>
