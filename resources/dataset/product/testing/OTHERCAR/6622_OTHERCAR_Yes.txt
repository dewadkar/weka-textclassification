            I got a great deal on my '91 Passat CL 2l 16V, which allowed plenty of headroom for some needed repairs. Warning- repairs can be costly, not always because parts costs are high, but because these cars were so complicated under the hood- if you have to rely on a mechanic to do the work, be prepared for high labour costs. Just try changing the air filter and spark plugs yourself, and you'll see why.

So, I've had to do head gasket, fuel pumps (there are two!!!), starter, alternator, fuel check valve, water pump, timing belt, a couple of valve lifters and ignition switch so far, all of which added $2000 to my purchase price. Still a good deal- the body is absolutely rock solid, with very minor surface rusting- all the more remarkable for Eastern Canada.

The joy of any model year of Passat is in the driving. This is a true enthusiast's car and definitely a notch above contenders like Honda Accord and Toyota Camry with respect to handling (and try finding a 10 year old Honda or Toyota on the east coast that isn't full of holes!). The steering is rock solid on centre, and the 4 wheel disc brakes provide stopping power like I've never experienced in any other vehicle. The Passat feels substantial and nimble at the same time.

As for engine performance, I have mixed feelings. The DOHC 16V engine was designed for the much lighter Corrado, so it is somewhat lacking in torque to get this big Passat moving. Incidentally, newer vintage Passats are lighter than the 90 to 93 model range. But once up to cruising speed, the engine is more than adequate. Zero to 60 may not be very impressive, but 60 to 80, as when passing on the highway is excellent.

Other pro's- seating comfort and driving position are superb, even on the basic CL- even better with GL. Interior space is out of this world- as if the car was designed around the interior. Even back seat passengers can be as comfortable as those in front, as the rear seats have a tilt adjustment- a feature that was dropped with newer models.

Some annoyances- the 5-speed gearbox is sometimes dodgey when cold, especially for first and second. I also find the clutch to be very heavy, and it takes in too close to the floor for my liking. It is hydraulic, and so not adjustable. From what I've read on various Passat sites, if you're considering this vintage Passat with Automatic Trans- run as fast as you can, and buy the Honda instead. These were NOT good automatics! Also, a very important note- the service interval for the timing belt is shorter than most cars- 50,000 miles as opposed to 80 to 100,000. That's because even though it's a twin cam engine, the belt only drives one of them, with an internal chain driving the other, so it's like a single cam belt doing double- duty.

A final word- the Passatï¿½s from '90 to '93 (designated "B3") are special. More and more the later models start looking like every other car on the road, but the styling of the B3 stands alone. There is a long, low and wide balance of proportion that is very appealing, almost reminiscent of a Rover 2000. I don't know if the B3 will ever become a classic, but I want to keep mine running, because I do not covet the newer models at all.
