            With a V-8 that really doesn't drain the gas pump as we anticipated it would, the Durango gives the best ride of all we tested...Expedition (Ford) and Yukon (GMC).  What's really nice is the room with the third seat in the back option.  Despite all that room it's not like driving a rolling Racquetball court.  With the shorter, wider stance, driving is much more pleasurable...especially when cornering.

On the downside there were some significant quality issues with the delivered vehicle.  Wind noise, much similar to the sound of a Tea Kettle whistling, has been experienced when driving above 50 MPH.  It has been back to the dealer several times but still exists.

Other than the quality issues, it has been a dream.  A great ride with good interior design...lots of cup holders, well placed storage.  It is hands down a better bang for your buck than the others in it's class.  And let's face it, it has some pretty lines to it too.<br><br>
