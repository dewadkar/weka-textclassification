                 I bought this car brand new in 1997 after thorough searching for a car.  It is a safe,  practical,  reliable,  yet wont put you to sleep type of car.  Those were the reasons I chose to buy this car.  

     My car now sits a 82,000 miles and I am still very satisfied with my purchase.  I have never had any major problems with it,  and it has only been in the shop for unscheduled repairs twice.  Once was for a broken power window that I broke (it was fixed under warranty) and the second time was for a minor oil leak that cost $75 to fix.  Other than that its just oil changes and basic maintenance.  With major services at 30,000 miles ($430) and 60,000 miles ($430).  Gas mileage is great for how much power this car has.  I get lots of looks when I drive around and personally I find this car has held up very very well.

      The only downsides to this car are all inherent to sports cars so I dont really have much room to complain.  

1. This car requires Premium unleaded,  and trust me if you put the cheap stuff in this car protests.  

2. Road and wind noise and pretty noticeable.  But hey its a sports car.

3. Tires are so expensive,  it is a odd size tire and to get decent tires you are going to have to fork over alittle over $140 per tire.


    This is a beautiful, sporty, economical,  and reliable piece of machinery.  (Is it legal to put all those in the same sentence together).  It is great for a car when you first get out of college.  I would not recommend giving one of the top of the line ones to a teenager,  maybe a less powerful 4 door Integra.  It will last you quite a while and will do it cheaply too.

Update:
My car just recently turned 100k miles.  I have done alot of commuting (150 miles every day) since my last review.  

Anyways when I took my car in for the 90k mile service I forked over a pretty penny.  I needed new brakes at all 4 corners,  new belts.  The total bill came to $832.  My car felt like new afterwards (maybe its was just my concious).

The only real problem I have had since recently was the center caps on my wheels.  They all either fell out or got stolen.  I had to pay $116 to replace them.     

Last month I was thinking about trading in my car for something new and bigger.  But money has gotten tight and I have just decided to keep my car til it dies (Im going to have it forever).  

Gas mileage still remains around 28mpg city and around 33-36mpg on the highway.
