            I just took possession of my new 2000 Intrigue GLS.

My initial impression is very favorable. It's very quiet and comfortable. The steering is precise, easy to turn at low speed and stable at high speed. The car is very quiet, although this makes it easy to make out noises outside the car (such as road noise). This is deceiving, though - overall it's quite hushed.

The engine is powerful, and turns barely at 2000 RPM @ 65MPH. There's lots of interior room. The trunk is cavernous. Visibility is very good - there's lots of glass all around, although the rear-view mirror is quite small. Outside, the car is quite large, visibly larger than a Lexus LS300 or a Saab. It's going to take some getting used to after a Geo Prism. 

I obviously can't comment on long term reliability. Hopefully, it's much better than the 1998's.

My main criticisms concern fit and finish. There is some kind of paper visibly sticking out from a seam in the dashboard. The hood is uneven where it meets the front grill, and overhangs visibly. Also, where the seat bottom meets the back, there is some sort of carpeting-like material instead of leather - very strange.

The standard (not the Bose) 6-speaker CD/cassette stereo is marginal. You can find adjustments so that the sound is OK for Jazz and Pop, Classical is harder. FM reception is poor (Boston is a tough area for multipath). You don't get much sound from the rear speakers - are they overloading the amp? I may have them replaced.<br><br>
