            I own a 1999 Chevy Venture LS extended cab.  It has an extremely comfortable interior and ride, gets great gas mileage and has plenty of power.  So why don't I want another?  I loved the air compressor and hose in the back until disentigrated also around 40k (1.5 yr).

The biggest irritant is the "convienence feature" of a power passenger rear sliding door.  You push the button to close it and just before total closure - it opens up again.  Sometimes (only 2 or 3 times) we've actually had to have someone outside the van push in the back of the door just before it would return (based on 3-4 previous unsuccessful attempts in that same attempt to leave).  GM recalled the van for this feature, we had it "fixed" and it does it more now than before!  Now we just got a 2nd recall on the same feature.  Note:  this problem only involves entering the vehicle - we have had NO PROBLEMS and no indications of potential problems when the vehicle is in motion.  A normal person hears the door beeping as it opens and would see that it's open before driving off.

Now, just out of warranty, the engine is knocking badly @ startup.  Had to upgrade to 89 octane gas to control it.
