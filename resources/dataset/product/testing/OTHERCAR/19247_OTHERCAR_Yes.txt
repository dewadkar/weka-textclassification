            I bought this vehicle because I was looking for something more economical than the truck that I was driving previously.  And the Intrepid was the choice that I came to.  I am getting around 23mpg in city right now, which I am very pleased with.  I was considering a number of different smaller cars, but I came out with the Intrepid.  One of the major selling points to me was the 3.5L V6, it definately gets you moving.  The Intrepid also has &quot;AutoStick&quot;, which is kind of fun to use.  It enables you to flip through the gears as if it was a manual transmission, but there is no clutch.  It lets you accelerate a little faster than normal once you get the feel of it.

It has a very roomy, comfortable interior, and lots of options.  I haven't had any problems so far, and I've owned the car for 6 months now.  I would highly recommend this car to anybody that wants something fun to drive, affordable, and stylish.  If you are in the market for a new car, the Intrepid is one you should definately take a good look at.<br><br>
