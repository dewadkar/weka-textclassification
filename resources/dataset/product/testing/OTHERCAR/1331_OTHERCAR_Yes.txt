            I have owned my 1999 Chevrolet Silverado LS extended cab for nearly a year.  What I love about this p/u is the comfortable ride.  The truck really looks good.  I have the 5.3 Vortec engine which gives this p/u truck plenty of pep.  I should say unbelievable power when you step on the accelerator the truck will throw you back in your seat.  Generally speaking the truck overall is very enjoyable to own.

The things that I have a problem with is a noise coming from what I think is the air conditioner fan.  When I accelerate hard I have a high pitch noise that sounds like the a/c fan.  The noise does not happen all the time but pops up from time to time.  The dealer where I bought the p/u has had it two different times, replacing the a/c fan, that didn't fix the problem.  

When I first got the p/u I had some trouble with the tires being balanced properly from the factory but that was fixed by the General tire dealership.
