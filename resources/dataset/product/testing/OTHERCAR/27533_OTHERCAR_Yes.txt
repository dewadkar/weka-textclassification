            In my four years owning this vehicle, my Jeep has never let me down. 

I have been in one major accident in my last jeep and two minor scuffles in the new one. In the minor accidents the jeep suffered so little damage that I didn't even need repairs; if I had been in any lesser car I would have needed my bumper replaced, or perhaps some dents hammered out.

During my major accident, I spun around about 270 degrees at 55MPH (on a highway), slammed into the median, rolled, bounced on the roof of the car, rolled, and then landed right-side-up on the shoulder of the highway. 

I walked away with one black-and-blue on my shin. I attribute my &quot;luck&quot; to how well the jeep is built. Although perhaps in the same conditions, any other car/non-jeep wouldn't have rolled because of the lower center-of-gravity, I still think I would have been a pancake in a less solid car. Moreover, know that I am not a crazy driver -- the accident was a result of less-than-controlled but not *extreme* conditions.

So the Jeep is SAFE.


COMFORT

I think the Jeep is quite comfortable. I easily fit 5 people in the car, none of whom are eating their knees or elbowing their neighbor. The radio that comes with the car is reasonable (although my tape deck stopped working after about 3 years of owning the car). The A/C and heat are effective at heating/cooling the car rapidly and offer precise enough controls to fine-tune the environment. The ride is smooth and quite, even if hopping a curb or briefly driving off-road. 

On the downside, I have (in a few bummer situations) tried to sleep in the jeep before, and it's just not comfortable. The front seats won't lean back far enough to make sleep realistic, and I'm just too tall (at a mere 5'11&quot;) to fit across the back of the jeep with the seats down.

Most notable, however, is the Jeep can fit soooo much stuff. It is elusive how much one can cram into the car with the back seats down. I have fit: a 15-foot pole, a la-z-boy chair, a chest of drawers, a stereo, computer, and small television, and two duffels of clothes all at once.


DRIVING

I am mostly happy with driving the jeep. As I mentioned the ride is smooth, the turning radius is better than many cars I have driven (being a Californian I perform a disproportionate amount of U-turns -- the jeep has not let me down). The pick up is very good for a car of it's nature. I have never had to make a tricky entrance to the highway in which I was concerned about gaining enough speed. In fact, with a little downhill I have gotten the Jeep up to 100MPH with still some juice left in the gas (there I go sounding like a crazy driver again; REALLY! I'm not!). 

Further, the jeep is far easier to parallel park than one would imagine. It may look imposing and long, but I have squeezed the jeep into some really tricky parking spots in downtown San Francisco without the typical 6 rounds of DRIVE-REVERSE-DRIVE-REVERSE-DRIVE-REVERSE-DRIVE-REVERSE-DRIVE-REVERSE-DRIVE-REVERSE parked. This grand cherokee is shorter than you would imagine

A nice notable feature is that the Jeep has a high &quot;carriage clearance&quot; (or something like that). I'm trying to point out that the Jeep can clear low bollards and curbs and sharp crests/dips in the road where most cars would scrape their muffler.


GAS/MILEAGE

Here is the Jeep's strange paradox. It guzzles gas, but it has a huge tank. It took me just short of $40 (!) to fill my tank yesterday (San Francisco gas prices are the highest in the country right now). Yet, if I wanted, I could drive from SF--&gt;Los Angeles on one tank. So I am not running to the gas station all the time, but when I do, my wallet is notably thinner.


THE LITTLE PROBLEMS YOU DON'T ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT

- Almost everyone I know who owns a Jeep from 1996 have had this problem with the trim on their car peeling off if they've ever parked the car in the sun. Jeep will replace it with trim that doesn't peel for free, but you lose the car for a day.

- The stereo system on every Jeep I've ever owned has gotten tweaked after using it for awhile.

- On automatics, the transmission slips some times causing the motor to race to about 3500rpm. Annoying, not a huge deal and didn't start on mine until owning it for 3 years; probably just needs a tune up.

- The acoustics make it particularly difficult to hear a conversation in the front seats from the back seats. 

- There is a little indented &quot;put things here&quot; spot on the dash above the glove compartment. Not only does anything from parking tickets to solidified rubber cement seem to slip out of this thing if you choose to drive at more than 5MPH, the reflective glare produced by any object in this spot makes storing things there untenable.

- The gas tank sometimes tells you it is empty, even if you've just filled it up. This may seem minor, but it can be dangerous if you're on a road trip and it is imperative you know how much gas you have left. 

- The coin holder sucks.


As you can see, these are mostly minor, and many would probably be addressed if I took my Jeep in for a tune up. I've had it nearly four years, 60k miles now and haven't had it in the shop once for any serious internal work (other than to fix that trim)


ON THE WHOLE

I do have mixed feelings about owning a jeep. I drive it in urban (or suburban), temperate conditions and so the damage I'm doing to the environment is probably more important than my desire for a powerful, solid vehicle.

But if I had no concern for the environment or the cars around me I think the Jeep is a comfortable, reliable, fun, and pretty stylish vehicle that won't let you down. <br><br>
