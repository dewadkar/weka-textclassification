            Thinking back, I used to really enjoy using my 35mm camera.
Now.... I can live without it.  Two years ago I purchased a Casio QV-700 Digital camera and fell in love with it.  No more trying to find a photo dealer to put your pics on a floppy.  No extra charges.  No buying film.
I purchased my camera from Sam's Club and paid $330.  Looking at today's price, I realize I got a great deal two years ago.  My camera goes everywhere with me.  I see something I want to capture, I turn it on and press the button.  If I don't like what I see, I can delete it and take again.  Sure beats the suspense of the 35mm, waiting for the developed pictures to return.
I can be klutzy at times and have dropped the camera a few times.  No problem, still works like a charm.  Guess these digital cameras are built more rugged than others.
The Casio QV700 is so easy to use.  When you return home, just attach the cable, start the QVLink program, and upload the pictures to your computer.  You can turn the pictures (if you are like me and take them the portrait way instead of the landscape way.  After uploading, just save the files to your hard drive.  If you don't like the way they look, get an inexpensive picture editor program, and lighten, crop, or whatever.
Now you have a great picture to send via email or publish on the web.
If you want a hard copy, get the photo paper and print.  All pictures that I have printed with my HP 850C printer (purchased in 95) come out looking great.
