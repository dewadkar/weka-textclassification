            Get ready for more outside noise...inside the car. I have to say that rain is louder, all outside noise is clearly heard in side the car. This takes a little getting used too. Do not say, I repeat do not say, what a jerk about some guy that is standing near your convertible, duh he will hear you...We purchased this vehicle because as we were looking to buy a car, the price was perfect. We only paid 3,000 for an 89 z24, book value is over 5,000. Another little pet pieve (spelling) of mine, about this car is that the number 24 is all over the car. Being a serious Nascar #3 lover, I want to tape over all the # 24's... My dh thinks that this is a little radical. LOL
