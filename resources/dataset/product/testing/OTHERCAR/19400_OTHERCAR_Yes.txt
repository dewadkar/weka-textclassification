            I purchased the CR-V because I looked for a vehicle that had good gas mileage.  It also needed to be roomy enough for me, my tall friends, and even my chubby friends.  I also knew that I wanted a SUV (trailer hitch, roof rack, 4WD).  I didn't want a vehicle that had all-time 4WD, so the EX model CR-V's part-time all-wheel-drive is nice.  I also liked getting a 7 year/ 100,000 warranty (better than any other I know of).  

This car will last me through grad. school (and I got it when I was only 17).  Hondas are built to last.  You may think that because it's a Japanese car, it's small.  It isn't.  For passengers, this car is actually roomier than the Cherokee and the Rav 4.  Cargo wise, the Cherokee has more room.  

Something my mom likes about this car that she can't find in her safety-conscious Volvo S70 is seat belt adjusters.  You don't want your head to be chopped off in an accident?  Just lower the seatbelt height.  

Another nice feature of this car is the well in the trunk.  You can store cold beverages in ice in it.  And, with the built-in picnic table, you can have a nice tailgating party.  There's a power outlet in the trunk too, so use that while you're at it.  On the EX model (I don't know about the special edition as it wasn't available when I purchased my CR-V), the seats can be arranged so that there are sleeping accomodations for 2.  That's got to be nice when camping out.  

However, this car does not have enough horsepower for me.  I'm sure that's one reason the gas mileage is so good, but in higher gears, I often get frustrated waiting for the car to speed up and switch gears.  The engine is also VERY LOUD.  So, I have to turn up my speakers (which are quite pathetic) up even more than before.  And, the CD player isn't that great either.  My CDs skip on pot-holes in the road.  What if I were to take this off the road?  I also don't like the texture of the steering wheel and armrests (on the car doors).  Also, why does the EX version of the CR-V not include leather when every other Honda EX model comes with leather?  

Overall, this car is for you if you want a small SUV that will last with a roomy interior, great gas mileage, and a relatively low price. <br><br>
