            First off...Nissan has made some quality vehicles over the year, and they must be doing their homework because, they just keep getting better.

I have seen a lot of Maximas on the road, including my own...well, it's my mom's but still, I like to drive it time to time to get a good feeling of comfort.

I have the sister car, the Altima, and that is one fine ride also.

The Stock Maxima comes with a clean V6 engine, and tons of horsepower.  That is the older versions...in the year 2000, Nissan beefed up the engine to a clean 220 HP engine.  That is kicking it.

If you go for the sporty look, go for the SE, there are so many options you can get, and they are well worth it, because Nissan designed the new Maxima so well, even a grump can drive this car and enjoy it.

I sat myself into a new 2000 Maxima SE and was I impressed.  The seats were leather the interior was very nice, spoiler, alloy wheels, cd changer, even the cigarette ashtray had felt inside of it, incase you wanted to put change inside of it.  The speedometer had a cool white background for a more sporty look, and everything was awesome.

To conclude, I believe that the Nissan Maxima is a very nice car to look into and it is affordable also.  It isn't that expensive....heck, I would make the car more if I sold it.  The car is much more worth that what it sells for. 

That's news from me.
