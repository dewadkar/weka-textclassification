            Instead of buying a new Dodge Durango, I took over the lease on a friend's new Disco Series II. Impressive vehicle. The price on this truck was about $42k, considerably more than I was going to spend, but the lease deal was good, so I took it.

The Disco II is a beautiful truck. There's lots to like about it. All the luxury features are there and everything is comfortable. However, for the size of the truck (larger mid-size) it's relatively cramped inside. And the doors, especially the back, don't open very far. Other negatives include a gas-hungry engine (admittedly no better than the Durango) and less than stellar acceleration.

But put the Disco in a tough situation and the 4WD, ABS and Traction Control will respond with confidence and ability. So far, there is no other vehicle I'd rather drive on crappy, wet roads. Clean, highway driving is effortless as well. And while minor, I LOVE the steering wheel, big padded thing with a nice bevel/angle at the top.

If you willing to spend the bucks and need a tough truck but without forgoing the luxuries, the Disco II is spot on.
