             Let Me Start off By Saying that I have owned 3 Previous Digital Cameras and 2 of those were the Sony Brand (Kodak DC-210 Plus, a Sony Mavica FD-90, and a Sony Cybershot DSC-F707) So I do write this review with some expirence. 

I upgraded from my F707 because it was almost 2 years old, had a good 5000 pics on its status readout, and was starting to just get worn down.

Ok, I got this camera at B&H Photo Video for $749. I loved my F707 and had a large Memory Stick collection so I wanted to get the model up. 

Why do I love the Cybershot F series so much? Well for 2 simple reasons, the 5.24 MegaPixels, which is the most for a consumer digital camera to date, and the Rechargable InfoSystem Batteries. Having a recharageable battery is AWESOME for a Digital Camera, those AA batteries get expensive after awhile! Plus the battery is smart and is able to tell you about how many minutes are left on it. I like the memory sick format because they are tiny and can fit anywhere(Plus You Can Trick your Friends with it, and tell em its a stick of gum :-) hehe) They are small, and hold a ton of data(Amazing what the World has today!!). Plus this model can accept the new Memory Stick Pro Media which can go higher than the old cards could (Currently 256mb, 512 mb, and 1gb) 

How Many Pics can a Memory Stick Hold? Well Im glad you Asked!! On the Highest Resoultion(5.24 MegaPixels) You can get about 8 Pics on a 16mb Memory Stick, Yup Thats right, each Image is 1.8mb in size, not for a Dial up user! 

I also like the upgraded USB 2.0 Transfer. It makes the data transfer about as twice as fast as USB 1.0

I do Not Recommend this camera for a beginner user simply because there are WAY too many features to use. Im still trying to figure out half of them!!. I like the Night Framing Feature. It uses the NightShot infa-red to let you frame your pics at night, and then turns off and uses the flash to illuminate the pic(That was the main problem I had with the FD-90, at night it was next to impossible to properly frame a photo at night, however it can easily be done with the F717). It also has a Night Shot mode, just like on the camcorders, you can take Green InfaRed shots in pitch black darkness. 

The F717 has a Dual LCD Screen, and a LCD Color Viewfinder. This is really nice, because when your at a play or somewhere dark you really dont want a Bright LCD screen illuminating everyone around you, so you just turn the Screen off and Look into the viewfinder, its that simple! 

That About Does It for My Review of the DSC-F717 

Thanks!!
