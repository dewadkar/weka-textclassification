            I bought my 98 Dodge Quad Cab after looking at several different comparative models from Ford.  The Dodge dealership was friendly and willing to work with me.  The ford dealership acted like they were doing me a favor.  The Ford F150's I looked at had a smaller cab size and I needed to fit five people comfortably.  The Dodge has plenty of room in the front and back seats. The Ford dealer did not have the options that I was looking for and was going to charge me more to order what I wanted. The Dodge Dealership had a great selection to choose from and within minutes I had picked out the truck that I wanted.  The dodge drives and shifts better than the Ford hands down.  It feels like you are riding in a car and is very comfortable.  After purchasing the truck my family and I, drove to Austin TX to visit family.  The ride there and back was extremely smooth and comfortable.  I have a horse and have pulled a trailer and could not tell.  Handling with the trailer was exceptional.
I would recommend the 1500 series for people who do some trailer hauling and other light hauling.  I wouldn't recommend it for people who live in town unless you get a smaller engine just because of the gas mileage.  If you want a vehicle that is comfortable to drive and rides like a car, I would highly recommend the Dodge truck.  <br><br>
