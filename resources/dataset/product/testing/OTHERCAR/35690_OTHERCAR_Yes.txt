            Hello I am a proud owner of a 1995 toyota tercel, it is the most wonderful economic car I have seen to this day. It has treated me well in many ways. It has saved me a ton of money in gas and that today is important especially being a teenager where money is tight on the highway it gets up 40mpg and middle to upper 30 in town! Its supprisingly quick even mine being an automatic-4speed. My family has owned this car since it was brand new, it has been in a few minor accidents and is still running ubelievably well with 124k miles on it. Ive only had to replace the usuals oil, brakes, tires nothing major. I would recomend this car to anyone looking for a fuel efficent economy car that you can always depend on. Its is great in the winters starts great and handles well. I've been all over the country in this car and never once has it broke down or had any problems. It is a true bang for the buck- Today you could find a nice used one from 5000-8000 dollar range, I have yet to see such a rad little car in so many ways!
