            I rented a 2003 Civic Hybrid (EVRentals - associated with Budget) for 3 days at Dulles airport (VA) in June ($45/day + tax). I did so because I was curious about how it would drive.  This seemed a better opportunity than a dealer test drive.  Would there be a noticeable lurch when it engaged and disengaged?  Would it be a powerless wimp?  
First, I should note that my current vehicle is a 1995 Honda Odyssey (the most car like of minivans).  0-60 of under 8 seconds went when I replaced my 1986 Mazda 626 turbo with the Odyssey so I am already used to 0-60 in 12 seconds. 
<b>Driving the car</b>
What I found when I drove the Civic is that it drives like a car, any car.  I never felt anything when the assist occurred, I had to look at the assist/battery charge gauge. I wasn't able to quite figure out if the engine was going to shut off at a stop or not.  Car rental companies never give you an owner's manual so I couldn't read up on the feature.  Not that it mattered.  There was never a lag getting the car moving after a stop, whether the engine turned off or not. As far as the 0-60 value, unless you are the first vehicle at the light, it doesn't matter does it?  I spent a short time getting used to the car and checking the instantaneous mileage with slow starts. I didn't want people to say "Those hybrids don't cut it" so after that I didn't make an effort to maximize mileage and drove with the traffic at the time.  I wasn't holding anyone up.
<b>Mileage</b>
I drove a total of 115 miles.  Some around Dulles, then a round trip to DC including a trip to the National Zoo. I would guess that about 60 miles was pure highway.  My overall mileage was 49.2 (according to the meter in the car). Prior to heading to Alexandria, the mostly city mileage was 43+ without effort to maximize it. The gauge for the electric motor batteries never went below half charge and was generally 3/4 or higher.
<b>What I liked</b>
The car rode and handled well, there was reasonable legroom for me as a driver (I am 6'2").  The driver's seat was comfortable. Being the only driver, I can't comment on the other seats. It was quiet, though I did hear 'distant sirens' that turned out to be noise related to braking. My 10 year old daughter noticed it too so I'm not crazy :-). Braking was smooth.  The CVT was, to me, amazing.  No sound change, no shift change; just as its name implies.  You basically don't know that there IS a transmission. The cruise and climate controls worked well. There was adequate room in the trunk for our suitcases.
<b>What I would like to see done differently</b>
I would not buy a sedan that did not have a split (preferably 40/60) folding rear seat. This functionality is key.  I LOVE my Odyssey's 3rd seat that folds flat into the floor.  Need it, use it. Need the cargo space, the seat is gone.  I'm sure Honda can move the batteries and provide this feature.  The entirely redesigned 2004 Prius is supposed to have a folding rear seat.
Why don't automakers put cup holders in the back seat of sedans?  Even 2 at the back end of the console would be a big improvement for those who take their kids from here to there and have to do the fast food thing in between.
I could find no way to lock the car from the passenger side, there was no electric lock button.  Perhaps I could with the key, but I didn't think to try.
