            We bought this vehicle when we traded in our Pathfinder.  There isn't one thing we don't like about the vehicle, but some exemplary features are the Bose stereo system, after-factory leather, spoiler, and the way she handles the road, regardless of the conditions. Driving this vehicle made this 50 year old grandma want to shut down anybody &amp; everybody on the road.  And I did...  The lines, the styling, the hugging of the road &amp; cornering ability.  Also, we had a head-on collision, going approx. 75 mph (my son &amp; I) and both airbags deployed.  We were able to control the car, pass the vehicle that had stopped in front of us, pull gently to the side of the road, and lived!  Excellent safety features!  Also like the location of the cruise, washers/wipers, the shape &amp; feel of the steering wheel.

Another great feature, is the arm rest pull through to the trunk.  

Not recommended for teenagers.  Too sporty, needs an experienced hand, especially the 5-speed manual transmission.
