            Let me get right to the point:  I love cars. Quick cars with slick 5-speed transmissions, capable handling, and no juvenile doodads. I own an Audi A4 and love it.  But my wife and I had a baby not too long ago, and we needed something that could haul us, the baby in his seat, two friends, the dog, and some gear. My wife said � let�s get a Taurus wagon! I almost cried at the dealership � looking at $20,000 of cheap plastic junk with an engine that no self-respecting car company would still be selling fifty years after it was first designed.  She agreed. Then she said, how about an Explorer? Ditto, except it rode even worse, cost more, and got terrible gas mileage. I like the idea of 4-wheel drive: I have it on the Audi. But I don�t expect to be doing enough off-roading to justify an Explorer, and I don�t buy into the other arguments for driving one anywhere but in, say, Colorado.  We looked at the new Focus wagon, which I think is a steal, and quite peppy, too, with the optional engine. But it failed our cargo test. To fit two friends in the back seat with the baby seat, you must have very small, very friendly friends, the kind you might find in a circus.

If you haven�t figured it out by now, here where my criteria:

1)	I did not want to spend a lot of money
2)	I wanted a car that I would like to drive, preferably with manual transmission, good handling, and a strong engine
3)	It had to carry enough stuff so that my wife would not divorce me

Who in the world makes an affordable 5-speed wagon that I would not be ashamed to own? Volkswagen, and that�s about it.  If your criteria are anywhere near as twisted as mine, look at the Passat. If you can afford it, check out a Bimmer wagon or an Avant from Audi.  If not, go directly online and look for a certified pre-owned Passat GLX VR6.

Ours is a 1995 model.  More than five years and 50,000 miles after manufacture it is still rock solid, and I have a year�s worth of factory warranty and a lot of consumer data saying the car is no lemon.  Starting with the outside, I think it is every bit as nice a design as the new Passat. Very clean. Simple. Elegant.  It will not take anyone�s breath away, but it�s no embarrassment, either.  Nice BBS 15� wheels. A simple grill (1995 was the first year they put the grill on the Passat, and I think it looks better for it.)  And a little tiny premonition of speed, a small hint of menace.

The interior is very nice. Good materials. Very Teutonic and businesslike. The leather seats up front are extremely comfortable, and adjust in all sorts of ways, including up and down.  Those in the back have a good deal of space. The heater and seat warmers could fry an egg about ten seconds after starting the car on a winter morning. A very good thing.  The instrumentation I think is particularly good, with a nice big fat tach. The dash, however, is a bit busy, with radio, climate controls, seat warmer dials, and other random knobs and buttons stuffed in almost haphazardly. I much prefer the Audi interior, but this is nice, too, in a Bauhaus way.  Function certainly trumps form.  Except for the cup holders, which are a complete afterthought, unfolding to hold two cans precariously in the passenger footwell.  Huh?  And there is no glove box. Again, huh?  Just a bin in the armrest. These few ergonomic quirks are really my only beef with this otherwise wonderful car.  Some people may also take exception to the sturdy accordion-like cargo cover, which travels along two rails that seem a little larger and clunkier than necessary.  But then again, this car was designed in the same country responsible for Birkenstocks.  Like them, the interior is a little odd, certainly not pretty, but very sensible and quite comfortable.

Let�s go for a spin, shall we?  I love the VR6 engine. Hubba hubba. But I stalled in first the first few times: the clutch is tricky. You get used to it.  The shift-throws are a bit long, but the shifter glides in an uncanny fashion, effortlessly, and locks into gear.  And boy does this car like to fly.  It loves to leap into action.  The Passat wagon is damned fast. 0-60 in about 8 seconds, just like Daddy�s car.  Let me take a minute to thank God for having a wife who not only can shift her own gears, but enjoys it, too. Thank you. This way, we both get to enjoy what represents a pretty major investment, even as a used car.

The driving position is a little odd for me. High and commanding. As for handling, the car seems to float just a touch. There is also a bit of torque steer on this front wheel drive. But nothing crazy. It�s not quite as wired to the road as its cousin, the Audi.  But otherwise it handles beautifully, with a firm ride that cuts cleanly through the corners.   My wife found the car a little stiff � it�s sprung for performance, with low profile tires on wide rims. But she loves it now, and is glad we don�t have her mother�s Taurus, which is what she really wanted.  To sum this up briefly, this car drives wonderfully, like a slightly larger version of my friend�s old 320i. I often forget it�s a wagon. It�s not quite the equal of a contemporary sports sedan, but it�s damned close for a five year-old station wagon. I love driving this car.

The only other concern I have is the wind noise. Hit 60 and you start to notice it. Hit 80, which this car will do with ease and in the blink of an eye, and you can�t hold a conversation without raising your voice.

When all is said and done, I really like this car. It comes very well equipped, with ABS and traction control and all the other mod cons that a decent high-end auto must have. I cannot believe they did not sell more. But I guess back in 1995 VW was not the hot �in� thing, while SUVs and minivans were all the rage.  Today, station wagons are experiencing a small, and sensible renaissance. Maybe its just that what was old is now new again. I certainly had a hard time seeing myself in a station wagon, until the baby was born.  If you want a toughmobile, or really need an off-road vehicle, get an SUV.  If you need to carry a small army, what the heck, buy any one of a dozen minivans (argh).  But if you don�t care for following the crowd, enjoy the art of driving yet need to haul a lot of stuff, look at a used Passat station wagon.  Even if I could afford the Volvo V70, or BMW 540 wagon, I think I would stick with this old wagon, happily hauling my family in style. It�s like paying for a cheeseburger and getting filet mignon. It�s like� It�s like� Well, it�s like paying for a VW (as I remember them from the 70�s) and getting a hot new Audi Avant.

This car deserves a 5 for value and fun, but I will give it a four only because it could have been perfect with just a little attention to some of the ergonomic details.
