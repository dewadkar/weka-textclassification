            I bought the camera for my wife's b-day. She is a professional photographer and she has been interested in dabbling in digital photography. I didn't want to spend a lot of money just in case she was disappointed. We are also going to Europe shortly and I wanted a point and shoot camera that wasn't bulky and something that a novice, like myself, could use. At minimum, my wife wanted controls over exposure, white balance, and shutter speed.

After months of research I was down to 3 cameras - the Canon S110, A20 and a Sony DSC-P50. Since they all have received very good reviews it was really down to ergonomics and personal preference. ... My wife loved the A20 because if had excellent ergonomics with a grip on the right side and room on the left side for you fingers. The layout of the buttons on the A20 was also straight forward (as were the S110). All cameras had a solid feel to all of them. Personally, I would have chosen the S110 because I love the small size of the camera. 

Overall a great camera that met my wife's expectations. We will be taking this camera to Europe and leaving the 35mm at home. 

Strengths:

Ergonomics - the hand grip and locations of all the controls, lcd, and viewfinder remind my wife of a 35mm camera. The camera also has a build in lens cover when off. Size - not too small, not too big. It is smaller than our 35mm point-and-shoot camera.

Photo Quality - excellent excellent excellent. The colors and sharpness are better than I ever expected. Prints come out wonderful. 

Features - for our purpose it has everything we need. It doesn't have a manual shutter control but that is ok. The auto shutter does a pretty good job. You can affect the shutter speed by placing the camera in manual mode and by using, or not using, the flash. I also appreciate the camera not having a "movie" mode. That is what a camcorder is for. I've seen "movies" made with digital camcorders and i don't find them useful or even viewable. 

Shutter Lag or lack of - this puppy is quick. I pretty much treat this camera like a 35mm point and shoot. This is especially true when the shutter is pressed half way to first set the exposure and focus. 

Uses AA batteries - this is how it should be (I think the Sony also allows for Lithium batteries). If I need batteries in an emergency I know I can easily find them almost anywhere. I bought a great charger (Maha C204F) and 1800mAH batteries.  The rechargeable batteries last for about 200 or so photos w/ lcd (although I personally haven't counted but they do last a while).  Otherwise, cheap alkaline batteries only last about 40 to 50 photos.

Price - it can't be beat. 

Menu Layout - the menus are easy to follow and have a simple hierarchy. I hate having to got through layers of menus to get to where I wanted to go.

Download speeds - very quick.


Weaknesses:

Compact Flash I only - doesn't allow the use of IBM's microdrive. However, a couple of 128MB CF cards have been more than enough for me

Low Light - in low light situations you need to have very steady hands or use a tripod when not using the flash.

LCD Screen - the size is fine but it is difficult to read in bright sunlight. I think the S110 has an advantage here.
