            I love this car.  My parents got this car for me when I got my permit.  Brand new and basic.  It's silver or grey, if you want to be dull about it.  It now has 150,000 miles, I know it's a lot, and is still going.  I've loved this vehicle since I received it.  It's great on mileage and I usually only have to fill the tank twice a week, if that.  

I honestly don't know anything about vehicles.  So please don't ask me any kinds of questions besides the basics.  Ok, I guess you can, just don't expect an answer.  It handles very well and is pretty decent in the winter, I live in NY so that will give you an idea about our weather.  It's an automatic, 4 cylinder, and has two airbags.  That's about all I know.

This is a great vehicle for someone just starting to drive or who doesn't have a family.  I only say that because by the time I get my daughter's car seat, stroller, and diaper bag in, there is no room for many shopping bags, much less my baby.  Just something to consider.  It is possible, because I'm still doing it, just not the most comfortable car with everything crammed in.

If I missed something, I'm sorry, just leave me a comment.  I'll change it if I can.<br><br>
