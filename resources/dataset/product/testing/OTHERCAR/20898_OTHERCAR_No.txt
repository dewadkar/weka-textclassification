            &quot;Honey,&quot; my lovely bride cooed, &quot;let's at least go look at that PT Cruiser.&quot;  It was a hot, late June Saturday, and the last thing I really wanted to do was to leave my home on the NC Outer Banks and go car shopping.  But recognizing the truth in that old Southern saying, &quot;If mama ain't happy, ain't NOBODY happy!&quot; I decided that it might be a good idea to go check out the Cruiser.  After all, it's a great looking car � or is that SUV? ...or mini-van? ...or, well...who knows?!?! � and since the old beast of burden, a '91 Saturn SL-2, had more than 175,000 miles on it, and we've been getting the Chrysler promos on the PT Cruiser for nearly a year, and my wife's business has a fleet of 17 Chrysler minivans on the road, this jaunt was really already predestined.  

So off to the local Chrysler dealer we went, checkbook in hand, financing arranged, down payment ready.  When we got there, the one Cruiser on the lot sat, freshly polished and gleaming, at the dealership's front door.  We stopped.  We oogled.  We drooled � but from far enough away to avoid slobbering on the car.  Then we entered the showroom.

The sales representative was with us in an instant.  &quot;We'd like to order one of those,&quot; we said, pointing at the car.  &quot;We'd also like to sit in it for a minute or two.  And could you maybe answer a couple of questions for us? Like which red does it really come in?&quot;

Without a moment's hesitation we were whisked to a &quot;consultation area&quot; � a small table with three chairs by the window of the showroom.  The rep got the requisite information from us, showed us the color chart, and answered most of our questions.  Unfortunately, the answer was usually, &quot;Um...well...we're not really sure about THAT right now, but I'll let you know as soon as we find out.&quot;  We were blinded by love at first sight.  We WANTED the PT Cruiser.

The order form was completed in what seemed like record time. Somewhat hesitantly, we handed the representative our check for $1000 � double the normal deposit at the dealership, but still reasonable considering how &quot;hot&quot; the car was.  There were a couple of nagging questions though.  

We couldn't get a price for the car.  &quot;Well, you see, they've just completed the first run, and it's hotter than expected, so they've closed down the factory and are retooling another line to double production.  Of course, the new run will be 2001s, and the price will probably go up about 3%.  We're not really sure about THAT right now, but I'll let you know as soon as we find out...&quot;  The bride and I exchanged glances and shrugs.  Aw, heck, it's not like we buy a new car every two years.  So our $17,900 vehicle could cost $21,000 � it's only money...

We also couldn't get the projected delivery date narrowed down to anything more specific than &quot;It could be here in three weeks.  Or it could be three months.  We're not sure, but as soon as we find out...&quot;  You know the rest.

All the way home we convinced ourselves that the decision was a good one.  And it was.  The car was everything we wanted � except, maybe, priced and available.  We could get it in a color we wanted, and even with a 3% price increase, it would still come totally tricked out for less than $23K.  Besides, we were promised that we'd hear in a few days, just as soon as the sales manager returned from vacation.

We waited patiently for two weeks, then called for an update.  There was nothing to tell us.  Had the car been ordered?  Well, it seemed that the factory still wasn't accepting orders � but we were first in the queue.

Three weeks into the mission, I stopped by the dealership to talk with the sales rep.  No, Chrysler still hadn't committed to a price or production schedule.  Yes, the rep knew that our deposit check had been cashed and not held until the information came in.  No, there was no problem � just as soon as they heard something, so would we.

Four weeks after placing the deposit, we started calling the dealership daily.  Our calls were not returned.  There was always an excuse.  There was never any information.

Five weeks to the day after our first visit, I called the dealership and spoke with a manager who hung up on me.  I called back and was yelled at and hung up on.  I called back again and got the general manager.  He explained that Chrysler was just &quot;stringing everyone along&quot; and that they still had NO idea what the price of the car would be, or when it might possibly be delivered. THEY, he whined, were victims of circumstance and corporate greed, and powerless to do anything except keep taking deposits.

As the manager spoke, the alarms went off in my head.  &quot;Chrysler has grossly underestimated the popularity of the car...  They can't keep up with demand...  They might not fill year 2000 orders until summer of 2001 if at all!!!  The price was open to the market...&quot;  In my mind's eye, I  saw &quot;Mazda Miata � 1990&quot; written all over the situation � car popular beyond expectation brings price jump with huge surcharges for the &quot;privilege&quot; of just owning one, whichever one a buyer could get.

I asked the manager if selling a product that couldn't be delivered � and that hadn't even been priced � might be illegal.  The manager whined that HE was the victim of Chrysler policy.  I asked why my deposit check had been cashed if they couldn't even tell me the price of the car, thus leaving a contract with a key item still missing, and therefore non-binding.  He indicated that it was corporate policy. Besides, he told me, I could buy ANY car on his lot � except, of course the one that my wife and I had come to purchase.  I suggested that &quot;bait-and-switch&quot; was illegal.  He hung up again.  I called back and told him that if my deposit wasn't ready to be picked up in one-half hour, I was prepared to call in the news services and let him answer the questions that they might have for him.  

When I arrived at the dealership an hour later, my check was waiting...in the manager's hand...at the showroom door! The PT Cruiser out front was gone.  My name had been erased from the queue of those willing to buy a car they couldn't even test drive, couldn't get a price for, and couldn't get a delivery date on.  I signed a release from the contract, took my check and ran.

These days, we're looking at another Chrysler � one with a German nameplate: Benz.  We're seriously contemplating buying a two-year-old M320.  They're highly reliable, immediately available, and sport an established price and resale value.  If we find one that we like, we'll probably take it home.  Then again, now that the Saturn has 185,000 miles on it and is still going like a champ, maybe we'll just wait until next summer and see what their new SUV is like.  After all, it will be roughly the same size as the Cruiser, will have great options, and � best of all � we'll know up front what the price will be.<br><br>
