            We bought ours used in July, 2002 with 16500 miles on it.  We paid $43500. vs a new one at $69000.  Easy decision - especially with only 16500 miles!

We live in the SF bay area and located the vehicle in Boston via Ebay.  Had it shipped by AutoDriveAway who damaged the vehicle in-transit and then refused to repair it - over $4000. of damage consisting of some dents and tons of scratches requiring new paint on roof.  Bumper damage.  DON'T USE THEM!

I had read reviews of these vehicles here, Edmunds, etc., and I must say that I disagree with most of the reviews that I've read.  Complaints about the cupholder location, plastic in the cockpit, etc., - I just don't get them.  

I will say that the stereo system is so-so.  Benz should not only put in a higher-quality head unit and amp, but better speakers as well.  Having said that, I'm a high-end audio listener.

The toggle button for the GPS system is poorly located but you will get used to it.

This vehicle is not only functional and damn good-looking, but the ML55 is FAST!  RAW horsepower and the handling is excellent for an SUV.  Very little tilt in the corners; steering is sharp and accurate in my opinion.  Ours also has the special, red AMG brakes.  You should know that the brakes and rotors on these vehicles have an average life of $20k.  The cost locally of doing a 4-wheel brake and rotor job is $850.00 - but hey! It's an AMG right?  :-)

The special AMG seats are very comfortable and hold you in without being too snug.  Visibility is very good in the vehicle as well.  The folding rearview mirros is an excellent feature.  HVAC system is excellent.

The vehicle gets attention everywhere we go.  It just looks fast sitting there.  But, it's also a sleeper.  We've stomped more than one very surprised BMW, Acura MDX, etc.

Speaking of the BMW SAV series - we looked at them, drove them, and like them very much except for a couple of things.

First, the cargo space in the rear is next to nothing.  Some people complain about the spare tire being located in the cargo area of the Benz ML series.  Even with the tire there it has copious more amounts of space than the BMW.

The ride of the BMW's - especially with the sports package is closely akin to a Jeep Wrangler - I don't care what anyone says!  It is very staccato like and bounces you around.  The cockpit is a dream - no doubt about it.  Good power - with the 4.4 or 4.6 version.  But the BMW is not meant to get dirty.  Take it out in the mud and that's where you'll get stuck.  'course, off-road is not it's intention or appeal.

The ML55 ride is hardly a Cadillac.  You will feel the bumps especially on rough, country roads.  Small price to pay for the pleasure that driving this vehicle provides.

I heartily recommend the ML55 for even those who are not driving enthusiasts.  It's solid and well-made.

5/7/03 - Here's an update.  We have experienced intermittant sticking of some idiot lights in the on position.  First time it happens it will freak you out!  But once you turn the engine off, wait a minute, and restart, the light go off.  Nothing Benz can do unless the fault is happening while at the dealer.

The stereo system, IMHO, SUCKS and is not worthy of a $70K vehicle.  Fidelity is very poor and separation is even worse.

The GPS would have led us on a few wild goose chases if we had not essentially known where we were going.  It will lead you off the street that you need to be on, send you blocks away and then back to the steet you need to be on - again.  And it will do it more than once.  System would be far better served as DVD based.  Traveling cross country will require a healthy handful of CD's - all for $100. + from the dealer - or go get them on Ebay.

The ride and power are excellent.  Mileage on our one long trip averaged 20.7mpg.  In-town driving was improved from 13.3 to 13.7mpg by adding a K&N air filter vs. the stock.
