            Yes, PuddleDuck. The second. You don't have to admit to naming your vehicle, but I freely admit to naming mine. I love it, so why not?

I bought the original PuddleDuck ( '92 Geo Tracker ) used in 1995. Once I got used to feeling like I was driving a small pick-up truck minus the bed, I found that I loved the way this little SUV handled. When the time came in 1998 to finally indulge my 40 year fantasy of buying a brand new vehicle, I didn't even hesitate; off I sped to my local Chevy dealer to purchase a new Tracker.

2+ years later, I am still happy with my PuddleDuck II. Roomy interior (even for me), easy to get in and out of, handles great, easy to park, and it's fun to drive. One thing that really impressed me was it's 4x4 capabilities. After a snowfall of 31&quot;, I was one of the few actually able to get out on the road. While the heavier 4x4's were plowing through the snow, my little Tracker seemed to actually go OVER the snow.

Some other pluses are it's minimal road noise, ease of maintenance, and durability. In the time I've had PuddleDuck II, regular oil changes are all the maintenance dollars I've spent. Well, with the exception of replacing the convertible top after a severe hail storm. Even after taking this vehicle off road as well as regularly driving some pretty rough back roads, the alignment remains true and the drive (on paved roads) is still smooth.

Will there ever be a PuddleDuck III? If and when my current Chevy Tracker ever gives up the ghost, can bet money on it.<br><br>
