            A few years ago, my family bought the first LS 400 when it rolled out, it was in the 30-40 K range.  The car was a great buy for the price, and much better then the Volvo we previously owned.  We've gone on to lease this vehicle 2 more times and finally purchased one this year.  The current LS 400 has a great engine, the smoothness and quiet that we've come to expect from Lexus, and is the best buy in the 50k plus luxury car category.  When going head to head against the 740, the S500, and the A8, only the 740 beats out the LS400, but only by a narrow margin, and the LS400 is less expensive then its competitors.  

The only negative i see for the ls 400 is that the design is very conservative.  The car is pretty much the same as it was when it first rolled out, with some minor differences.  We've had few problems with the LS 400, and when there was a problem, Lexus immediatley fixed it for us.  For example, on our previous LS 400, the whole brake system was messed up, and we were 3 months past warranty, but the guy in the shop hooked us up and replaced the whole system UNDER warranty!!!  The service is great, and getting a loaner car everytime you bring the car in is a very nice plus.  Another plus we got when we bought the car was a book of coupons.  We got coupons such as a loaner car for any weekend, free detailing, and free car wash.  Though it isn't much, its the little things that pushes Lexus as a company over others.   

One more thing; if you're the type of person that likes to race, this car can take anybody off the light, smoking any Civics, Preludes, Integras or any other car that wants to race you.  The V8 pumping out 290 horsepower, a top speed of 143 and a 0-60 of 6.9 is too much for a car like this.  Watch out for a GS400 however, which by the way is also a great buy.  A great buy, and one that you will enjoy for years to come.
