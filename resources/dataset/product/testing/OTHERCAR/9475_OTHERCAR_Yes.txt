            I have had several dodge rams in the past.  My ex husbands 1985 has over 230,000 miles on it and still runs like a champ!!  Very sturdy very reliable.  We used that vehicle for a small home based hauling business and it never let us down.  I bought a new one in 1995 and another in 1997, both live up to every expectation I have ever had for them.      Style,comfort, reliability, and power, dodge ram has it all.  Plus, when you're in your dodge ram you get a great feeling, like you are on top of the world!!      It's designed with the driver in mind.  Everything is placed where the driver can easily reach it.  The only complaint I have ever had is the fact that the ones I have do tend to sway a bit in high cross winds, but that isn't enough for me to not highly recommend this vehicle!!!    My brother and 4 friends have also bought this truck after driving and riding in mine<br><br>
