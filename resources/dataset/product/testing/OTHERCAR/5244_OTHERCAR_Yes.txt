            <b>Yes I know I SHOULD of tested a Jaguar that was in the price range of the 5 Car comparison but I just couldn�t resist this opportunity. I will test the appropriate S-Type at a date later hopefully. This car does overstretch the original testing criteria, by about AUD $100 000. The original S-Type was very eagerly anticipated, but was criticised for having a cheap interior and generally being considered to be an expensive Ford in Jaguar clothing. Recently though, the S-Type has been very thoroughly revised and the criticisms of the original model were silenced. The car now has had a revised interior, exterior styling, retuned suspension and better prices. The Type R model is Jaguar�s sports denotation, comparable to AMG (Mercedes) or Motorsport (BMW).

The model I tested was the S-Type R.</b>


<b>Styling</b>

Jaguar has always had their own distinct style, famous for the low-slung XJ 4-door sedan and the slink XK 2-door coupe/convertible. The S-Type definitely has it�s own style. The new generation S-Type is supposedly a recreation of the original S-Type of the 1960�s. I can most definitely say that the car is its own style, and it looks excellent in my own opinion. Most striking is the front end of the car with four round headlights, a bonnet that streamlines itself around the headlights and an oval grille. In Type R guise the grille is covered with a very fine chain link type material, similar to the material that Bentley uses on their Turbo R. Very attractive, I am sure you will agree. 

The side profile of the car is also very attractive, curved and elegant yet modern. The S-Type retains the traditional high beltline of Jaguar. The rear of the car is the only thing I have a problem with, the taillights do look �Fordish/Fordesque� and do no suit the look of the car. If the taillights were changed the rear would look excellent, the taillights do let it down. A worrying trend among many designers concern the taillights, is it something in the water? The �Zeus� style alloy wheels suit the car well and the 18� wheels in the front and rear promote the sporting demeanour of the car. 


<b>Interior and Accommodation</b>

Traditionally Jaguar has used the usual British adornments for its interiors. Soft Conolly Leather, Highly polished wood veneer (and lots of it) and chrome adornments have been common place in Jaguars, making it a little stuffy and club like for some while others love the opulence of the interiors. The S-Type is no exception, although not to the extent to that of the XJ for example. The original car had a shocking dashboard, full of panel gaps and too much hard, creaking plastics. The revised S-Type has done away with the flat dashboard and now a more curved dash has taken its place. In my opinion, the revised interior really does suit the car with maybe a few minor imperfections.

The opulence of the Jaguar interior is very British, thick slabs of walnut veneer adorn the upper dashboard and the transmission surrounds. This wood grain however is a much different variety; it is GREY. This Grey wood grain also finishes the door trims. Obviously to give a more sporting appearance although I would prefer to have normal wood grain in my car. The layout of the dashboard itself is a little disappointing. A complicated mix of buttons, an LCD screen and no clear division between Climate Control and Audio Controls as well as the LCD screen controlling the navigation. To top it all off the dash is covered in BLACK PLASTIC! Why couldn�t Jaguar just cover it in the Grey wood grain? The sound system is fairly poor with only 4 speakers, thankfully it can be upgraded to even a Mini Disc player! Jaguar seems to have adopted the German way of having a very long list of options; frankly I was very surprised with some of the omissions on this car that you are required to pay more for. Examples include: 
<I>Jaguar Voice: voice control of audio, automatic climate control, telephone - $1500
Navigation system: touch screen navigation system - $6000
TV tuner (only available with navigation system) - $1700
Sunroof: glass, electric with tilt and slide - $3700 (This is a terrible omission)
First aid kit - $100 (Example of Ford Cost Cutting)</I> 
Some of the options here are ridiculous, being equipped on cars AUD $60 000 cheaper.

The Jaguar S-Type R does have rather comfortable seats. You really do �sit� in a Jaguar, it is like you are driving some sort of animal. I am used to Teutonic Firmness, and these seats aren�t quite as firm but still adequately comfortable. Power adjustable seating with memory for both seating position and mirror position is provided and it should be.  It must also be mentioned the steering column is electrically adjustable. If you get claustrophobic maybe this isn�t the car for you, the interior is very snug fitting and you don�t have much excess space. Those of a larger frame may not even be able to get comfortable. It is a real driving car though with excellent driving position. Typically, the Conolly leather used is soft and smells excellent. Rear seat space is fairly poor, something the old model was criticised for, and as you probably guessed, my 194cm frame had trouble fitting comfortably in the front seat.

Safety in the Jaguar is very high, with dual driver and passenger airbags as well as front side airbags. Rear side airbags are not available unfortunately. Front and rear head restraints are fitted to all seats and an alarm with immobiliser is equipped to protect your toy. Curtain airbags and 3 point belts are also fitted to all seats.


<b>Engine and Handling</b>

Considering this is Jaguars performance model, I have to say that I was expecting a lot. The S-Type lived up to my demands and more. The Jaguar uses a supercharged 4.2 litre V8 with dual intercoolers. You wouldn�t know what lay underneath the bonnet when you first start up, a very modest exhaust note can be heard, however as soon as you touch the sensitive accelerator the scenery whizzes by. The engine produces masses of torque, meaning the engine really does not need to be pushed that hard. The S-Type R produces 553Nm of torque at 3500rpm. The acceleration of this car is blistering, 0-100km/h in 5.6 seconds and it feels quicker. This certainly is a car to get the German Autobahn Stormers (Mercedes E55 and BMW M5) scared.

The Automatic transmission in the car is ZF�s new 6-speed automatic transmission used in the E65 BMW 7-Series. This is an excellent automatic too, controlled by a learning and considerate computer. To all of those who must know, there is a Semi-automatic gearbox (WHY JAGUAR WHY?) using Jaguar�s patented J-Gate semi-automatic. Pushing the gear lever left (or in the US right) will allow you to access the manual mode. It is a stupid system, similar to shifting an automatic transmission lever manually. Do yourself a favour and leave the Automatic in �D�, and enjoy the 6-Speed�s seamless gear changing and performance spreading ability. Braking is excellent, utilising huge ABS brakes. I found feedback to responsive and the system is equipped with Brake Assist, being able to detect panic stops.

The S-Type R handles superbly. The Jaguar salesman went to great lengths to explain the reengineered suspension to me to me, pointlessly as it is still too complicated for me to understand � maybe it was the way he explained it. Jaguar uses its CATS (Computer Active Technology Suspension) on the Type R as well as adjustable dampers and stiffer springs. The dampers can be adjusted by the system within milliseconds. This has some unexpected advantages. When corning the CATS system allows the cornering wheels dampers to soften to reduce body roll. The system prevents understeer by once again adjusting the appropriate dampers (yes I can explain it but it will bore you to death). Something that I truly like about the system is the fact that it cannot be detected while in use.


<b>Final Evaluation</b>

The Jaguar S-Type R is an excellent performance sedan. When compared with it�s nearest opposition the S-Type R is a bargain, the BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz E55 being around AUD$ 200 000. If you can live with the interior imperfections then the S-Type R is an excellent choice. 

For the large number of Jaguar enthusiasts, this car is an excellent addition to the S-Type model range and stays true to Jaguar�s sporty heritage. While I did like the performance, I am not sure that I could grow to like the interior, due to the lack of space, lack of features for the price and high belt line. Choosing between the S-Type R and an alternative is an emotional decision. Do you want a Jaguar pedigree? It is all about personal taste.
