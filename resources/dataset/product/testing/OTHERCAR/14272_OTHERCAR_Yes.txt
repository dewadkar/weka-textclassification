            As sport compact car magazine once said "The RX7's best feature, the compact, light weight twin turbocharged rotary engine, is also it's worst feature."  I can agree with them entirely.

Having once owned a 1995 Mazda RX7 twin turbo touring package, I know the joy of the FD3S (3rd generation, 93-95) RX7's.  The car is so sleek and lightweight, and with the small and featherlight twin turbo/intercooled 2 rotar engine, it's an engineering work of art.  And a blast to drive.  Until it breaks down.

The world of rotary engines is extremely small and very complicated, yet there are a small amount of technicians out there that have mastered it.  The engine in the rx7 is about the size of a keg of beer and sits behind the front axle giving the car nearly perfect weight distribution.  However, with the joys of the 13B twin turbo rotary comes the pains.  It is an unreliable engine, and even driven normally with no modifications it has a hiccup once in a while.  Parts for the engine AND the whole car are expensive and you have to wait a long time for them to come from japan, where the RX7 lives on.

The car itself is a good design though.  The interior fits like a glove for most normal size adults, the leather seats are comfy, and the BOSE sound system in the touring package equipped cars is great.  However, a small 2+2 backseat for the occasional ride with friends would be nice (A'la toyota supra, 3000GT, and japanese market RX7).

While the RX7 is not a car for average person, the enthusiast who understands an occasional reliability hiccup and appreciates fine handling and turbo power will love it.  If you can find one.
