            When I buy an item I always see to it that I research for it thoroughly and when I decided with the S7000 it was not exempted from my research. 

While I was in the process of selecting for the best digicam for me, I knew what I wanted. I had been an SLR user for 15 years so regarding picture quality, I know what I need from a digital camera. 

There are enormous choices out there in the prosumer digicam market and the notable ones are the Sony F717, Minolta Dimage A1, Olympus E-20, Nikon 5700, Canon G5 and of course the Fuji S7000. These are the ones I tested in stores and even at home. 

I was dead set on the Dimage A1 when I chanced into the S7000 at one local store. It was then selling at U$650.00 which was way cheaper than all the other cameras noted. Going home that day I postponed buying the A1. I was so impressed by the build quality of the Fuji that prompted me to research through the internet everything about the s7000. Newsgroups, user forums everything. 

I have read issues about noise especially from the "professional" reviewers but users claimed otherwise. In short, there are polarizing groups about the S7000. After a month of long research, I decided to buy the S7000. This time it was even a better deal at U$600.00. I said to myself that if it did not perform as I expected, I can always return it. So I bought it finally.

The package is very minimal in contents. Quickly I set it up and have it running in just a few minutes. Users of S7000 recommend using the 12MP fine, and soft sharpening setting which I did. Went out to the field and indoors and took all the shots my memory could take. Connected the camera to my laptop and voila, I am now previewing my shots.

The verdict:
The shots taken at 12MP were fabulous onscreen with rich colors without the noise and artifacts that some reviewers here are talking about. I was not convinced yet because I have to see it in print if it produced great photos and man, I was not disappointed at all. All the photos (24 in all) printed in A4 were just stunning. No noise and no artifacts at all. I was sold. I said to myself, this baby is for keeps.

After a week, I again subjected my new toy to another shooting expedition. With a bigger memory (1GB)installed, I can take all the photos to my hearts content. Again, I was not disappointed at all. I also tried the native 6MP resolution but it was not as beautiful compared to the 12MP i have taken. This camera shines most at 12MP fine, and soft sharpening or 12MP ccd raw. 

A month passed and I never looked back. My nikon and canon SLR are just gathering dust at the moment. The Fuji S7000 takes pictures as good as my SLRs without the need of carrying bulky lenses and spending a fortune on developing and printing. With The S7000, I only choose what I print so it is now more cost-effective for me.

Due to my excitement about the capabilities of the S7000, I also added accessories to it. I bout an external flash, filters and adapter ring to bring out the best in the S7000. And now I am a very happy camper with the S7000.

Future shoppers have to be warned that this is not your casual point and shoot camera although it can be used like one but you will never get the best out of it if used in its default setting. That is precisely what the other reviewers here did which is not at all the kind of setting that would bring out the best in the S7000.


For U$600.00 nothing comes close to it. The quality of the photos, the features and the build quality is just too good to pass.
