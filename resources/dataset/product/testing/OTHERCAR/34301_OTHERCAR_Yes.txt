            164,000 miles later, my Rodeo still runs strong! I really love this car, and I plan to have it until it croaks. Mine is the 4WD, V6 model.

The Rodeo is extremely roomy, and it handles well off-road, and...you can read all about that stuff in any of the other reviews. What I think is great about the Rodeo is that it has a strong engine that will run forever if it is treated with respect.

By treating it with respect, I mean routine oil changes and an occasional air filter and serpentine belt. Of course other things have come up in the life of my Rodeo, but nothing that can�t be expected. I put in new brakes at 100,000 miles, and a new starter at 145,000. 

There is plenty of room under the hood to work on the engine. Some cars, especially foreign, cram the engine so tight that it makes it impossible to work on the engine without taking it to the dealer or a mechanic. NOT THE RODEO! I am a total rookie at auto repair, but I have found working on the Rodeo to be easy and even enjoyable � probably because the repairs have been so minor.

If you are debating on whether or not to buy a used Rodeo, my advice is to do it. They�re great cars that are well built. I've driven mine from Austin to San Diego and back 5 times--22 hrs each way!<br><br>
