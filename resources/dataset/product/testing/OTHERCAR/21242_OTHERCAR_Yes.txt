            We were deciding between a 1996 Ford Taurus and the 1995 Toyota Camry.  We chose the camry for a couple of different reasons (all of which proved to win out in the long run).  1) the resale value of the Camry holds higher for a longer period of time (when we refinanced the car a year after we purchased it due to lower interest rates available, we were able to cover the entire balance due for payoff because the value the car had held already for that short 12 month period)  2) the mechanical history of the Toyota Camry is not a nightmare, besides brakes and tires all we have had to do is change fluids and add gas 3) we were able to get an extended Fidelity warranty with the purchase of the Camry which covers virtually any mechanical breakdown with only a $100.00 deductible (we have put over 25,000 miles on the car since we purchased it and have never 
had to use this, even once)  

This Camry rides like a luxury sedan, even though we have heard that the newer models are not as smooth.  The 2 door Solera looks nice, but we need the practicality of a 4 door car.

Our next vehicle will more than likely be a Toyota, if it's a car. <br><br>
