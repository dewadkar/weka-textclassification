            Okay picture it....... driving down the street your hair whipping in the wind, all eyes on your sporty new car, the smooth leather, and all the scenery you pass by, yes, this could be you!!! Aha! The Chrysler Sebring is the coolest convertible out there. Sorry to disappoint all you Corvette, Eclipse, or even Mietta goers, but the Sebring has so much more going for it. Number one, it is huge for a convertible. Yes there is plenty of room. Two, it has the hottest look to it. None other does it compare too. Number three, it offers a sleek looking and feeling ride. Number four, the price...... need I say more??? Man, this thing is hot. RUNS GREAT! FEELS GREAT! PRICE IS&gt;&gt;&gt; GREAT! I cannot believe what a deal this baby is. And, what a unique look it offers. I just love it. <br><br>
