            Hi, I just wanted to drop in my opinion about my own 96 Toyota Camry. I purchased this particular car to replace my money-burning 88 BMW 325e, and I do not regret the choice. Although used, it was in pristine condition and still had that &quot;new-car&quot; smell. Everything was intact, except for the owner's manual, which I've still yet to purchase. Upon driving away from the Nissan dealership (yes, Nissan), I was pleasantly surprised at the Camry's rapid, but smooth, acceleration, and her incredible agility on the interstate. Emergency lane change? You barely have to twitch the steering wheel, she responds that easily! Passing? Either punch the pedal or push that little button on the gear selector marked &quot;O/D&quot; and your RPMs jump drastically and the car rockets forward. That part is the best! I also got a taste of how good the brakes were when a fellow motorist got in front too close for comfort. Talk about stopping on a dime! Once home, I felt very exhilarated and ready for another drive, all thoughts about my sporty Bimmer gone. Granted, now, there were a few things I felt needed improvement, but these were mostly cosmetic. The first is something that cannot really be corrected, only minimized, and that is the amount of static electricity that builds up on you. The cloth seats and carpeting allows quite a charge to build mostly in the driver, sometimes passengers too, and you can feel it when you touch the metal. Also, the driver's seat was snug, but only for a while. On long trips, after maybe half an hour, my back began to ache. To alleviate the problems of static electricity and back ache I put in the chair cover made of hard, wooden beads. Talk about relief! If you decide to install that, try to make sure that the design does match at least somewhat. A small item that I also purchased was a custom-fit Heat Deflector shield. This no doubt can save you money on faded and/or cracked dashboards, along with a decent tint job, which my Camry already came with. Oh, and I also put on a full frontal Bra to protect the paint finish from all the garbage on the road. Maintenance has been kept to a minimal: oil changes, and some minor work that was needed in her engine bay, though the cost of that was ultra-low thanks to the extended warranty I'd purchased. For now, the only problem is that the power antennae is stuck and will not retract, so it looks like another visit to my local Toyota dealership is imminent. I would like to do some modifications to the Camry, but that is limited. She is a sedan, not a sports coupe, but sometimes I feel like flying down the highway, so I'm planning to compromise. Running gear is next on my list of items to be improved: bigger rims and wider tires. I already put a drop-in K&amp;N air filter which I think has helped performance, so I recommend that if you want a little more boost. Later on the horizon: new speakers, amps, and subwoofers in the trunk (we're talking a lot of room back there!). Other than that, the Camry is an excellent choice of car. It allows room for you to personalize (go ahead, use your imagination!), offers one of the smoothest rides I've ever felt, it's extremely safe (airbags for driver and passenger), roomy (my rear passengers never complain), and....what else? It's a TOYOTA, and that spells RELIABILITY!<br><br>
