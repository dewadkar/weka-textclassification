            I recently bought a 2000 Neon after driving a Cavalier for several years. It was time for a new car and, although I loved my Cavalier, I wanted something with a bit better mileage - especially with gas prices fluctuating all the time. I wanted to have a look at the Neon simply because I've seen them around town quite a bit and wanted to see what the attraction might be.

Before I took it out for a spin, I was skeptical about its performance. Sure, it has a 2.0L SOHC 16-valve engine, but I was worried the car might strain on hills and whine when trying to pass. I'm very happy to say that none of my fears were realized. The car handles much like my old Cavalier: great control with a smooth ride. And it runs as great on the highway as it does in the city. However, while it may be just a matter of time, I can't get a smooth start off the stop line like I could with my old car. I hate lurching forward but the car doesn't seem to want to move without a significant press of the gas pedal. And, by the time I manage to give it enough gas to go - sure enough - it leaps through the intersection. As I said, it might be me. But it'll take some getting used to.

Bottom line: a nice ride, great on gas, and all at a very reasonable price.<br><br>
