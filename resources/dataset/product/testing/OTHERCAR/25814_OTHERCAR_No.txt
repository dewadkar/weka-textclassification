            What a total hunk of dung this car is! I bought it in January of 1997 out of complete desperation for a running vehicle. Boy, what a huge mistake. I too thought this would be an inexpensive, reliable mode of transportation. It has been nothing but a problem since day one. I have been stranded so many times with this car, it's not even funny. The car has refused to start for no apparent reason several times. And then, when I call for ( and pay for) help, it starts right up. Would love to sell it, but can't get a fraction of what I paid for it. So, it looks like I'm stuck with it for a while. Would strongly advise anyone considering buying a Suzuki Swift to consider walking to work instead, at least you can count on your legs being there for you.<br><br>
