            i bought my Honda Accord EX V6 one month ago. i've putted up 600 miles on this car. i want to see how this car really performs before i write a review on it. so far, it's worth every pennies. i paid $26500 for my car, that includes a rear spoiler. if you could spend an extra $399 for a spoiler it will make your Accord looks sleeker and sportier.
here is my report on the EX V6, go with the V6, it's worth the extra $5000.
240hp V6    standard leather trim   8 ways driver power seat, 4 ways front passenger seat.  audio control buttons on the steering wheel. 6 disc CD changer, i love the CD changer, it is quiet and has really good sound quality. 6 speakers audio to match up with the CD changer. side airbags, front and rear curtain airbags. this car has a total of 8 airbags. i love the clear alloy molding for the interior; it matched up well with the black leather. the interior is really roomy; plenty of leg room although head room may be a problem for 6+ footers. rear passengers will have plenty of space to roam. Honda has expanded the wheel base and make this model a bit taller and longer then previous models. now for performance... the V6 adds a kick to this car, plenty of power for you to pass the semi. 18 wheeler or to merge into traffic, 16inch 7 spokes alloy wheels. the EX V6 has standard ABS, traction control. this is an excellent feature for those of us who drive in winter months and slippery roads. it also has electronic brake distribution. all of this means great braking, steering could use some improvement. this car tend to understeer a little bit, maybe it's me. at high speed 60mph or above the steering seems to be a bit loosen. ride is good, not excellent, tend to get bumby if you hit a  small pot hole or rough road surface. cabin noise is limited which is also another improvement from Honda because previous Accords tend to have excessive interior noise. well, beside all of these features this accord has some other fun tricks to play around with like the key auto window opener and electronic immobilizer, progressive dashboard lighting.
over all, this is a good car, you are paying $26500 with features that you only find in Lexus or Beamer. i say if you have the bucks, go out and get this car. it is a good bargain.
