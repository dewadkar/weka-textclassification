            I own a 1992 Nissan Pathfinder SE 4x4 and I couldn't love it more. I've wanted one since early in high school - its a gorgeous car.
To start, I bought it in the early part of 2000 with 120,000 miles on it for $8,500. I took it into the dealership for its major scheduled tune up, which ran me around $800. There were some problems with the axle, and according the guy at Firestone, it was due to poor service workmanship - not a Nissan error. I also had the exhaust manifold replaced recently - a standard problem with this vehicle. All the repairs ran me around $1,500, which at a total of $10,000, was still under blue book.

Driving this car, I feel extremely safe - and I say this after my last car, a 1980 Mercedes 300 Diesel, a veritable tank. I've taken the Nissan off-road quite a bit - its an extremely manageable drive. My friend who has a 1999 Toyota Tacoma drove my Nissan off-road and was impressed. The adjustable shocks make for a tight, smooth ride over rocky terrain, and the engine, though a little underpowered on the highway, handles beautifully in low gears off-road.

In terms of comfort, I have factory 6x9 speakers in the back with a pair of standards up front - great sound for what it is. I have a post-market CD-player in and it sounds awesome. The leather seats are more comfortable than those in my mom's 1996 Mercedes. Its incredibly roomy, and my rear passengers love the raised rear bench - they get a great view. Legroom is plentiful in both front and rear. The rear seats fold down for a completely flat cargo area, and I've successfully moved an entire apartment inside. I've even fit a huge bookshelf inside, already assembled, sticking just slightly out the rear pop-up glass. Perfect fit - and the bookcase is over 6 feet tall.  The flat cargo area also makes for a great place to sleep - which I have done MANY times.

The drive is smooth. I have off-road, all terrain BF Goodwrench tires on it - I think they're the 10.5x16 but I'm not sure. They're big and beefy though. They make some noise, but if you're as fanatic as I am, then the &quot;wooshing&quot; sound they make around curves is really cool. I used to live at a Boy Scout camp and we took the thing everywhere - and its small enough to fit through a tight squeeze of a canyon, even with all the inside room.  As it has been noted many many times, by many many people, the Pathfinder is a bit underpowered. I've never tried towing anything, so it hasn't really bothered me. If I wanted great acceleration, I wouldn't have bought an SUV. 

The only things that bug me about the car are a rattling in the drivers side door (which I could fix if I cared enough), the import car maintenance rates (more than a domestic car to maintain per visit, but its so reliable that it doesn't really need much maintenance), and last of all, its a bit hard to parallel park because with the spare tire on the tailgate, its hard to see where the car ends and the other begins, and just in general its difficult to figure out the exact position of the car. Oh, and the turning ratio has something left to be desired. Be prepared for U-turns becoming 3-point turns and 3-point turns becoming 5-point turns.

Any and every car has pros and cons. In my situation, this car provides everything I need and want and nothing I don't. You can really beat this car up and it will just keep going. I can't wait to supe it up and add  lift kit, brush guards and a turbo booster. If you want a reliable, sturdy, roomy, no frills SUV, this is the car for you. It also has a lot of expansion possibilities, for accessories.<br><br>
