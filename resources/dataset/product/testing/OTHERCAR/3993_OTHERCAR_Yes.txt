            It would probably be a porsche.  But if I had to have one to depend on, then i would definitely choose a Saturn.  With steel-reinforced doors, and bounceback bumpers, hardly any harm will come - to either man nor vehicle.  A variety of colors, a sleek look, the handle isn't that bad, and the gas mileage is near unbelievable.  

My family owns 3 saturns, soon to go on four.  None of them have had to have a checkup except the occassional oil change or 100,000 mile tuneup.  Good for both long and short hauls, there is no other car quite as dependable and trustworthy as a Saturn.<br><br>
