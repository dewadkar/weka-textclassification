            This was my first digital camera and after reading other reviews decided on the Olympus.  It is easy to use although the menus can be a little confusing until you get used to them.  Picture quality is excellent, even without the flash. The biggest problem is the manual that comes with it could be better - they should have separated the different language instructions into sections instead of all together.  Battery life can be extended by not using the LCD screen.  Downloading the pictures to the computer via the com port is easy using the supplied software.  The Quick Stitch software that came with the camera is great.
