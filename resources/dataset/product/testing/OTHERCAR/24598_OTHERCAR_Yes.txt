            I am about as non-mechanical as anyone I know.  I don�t even do my own oil changes.  

I can check the oil level and add oil, gas up the car, and change a flat, but that�s about it.  I do know a few danger signs like sulfur smells in a Dodge van could be a faulty regulator, and white smoke coming out of the exhaust of a Dodge Arrow coupled with a rising heat gauge is a really bad sign.  After I got the head gasket of that lemon semi-fixed for the third time in the spring of 1994, I traded it in on a new 1994 Toyota Tercel.

I was looking for an inexpensive compact car with a good repair record. I especially need cars that don't break down since I know so little about them.  Since I didn't have the money for a Lexus, I settled on Toyota.  Even though the Tercel was on the low end of the line, <i>Consumer Reports</i> confirmed that its repair record was excellent, so that's what I purchased.

My Tercel is still running, and I�ve been pretty brutal with it as it now has 234,000+ miles on it.  Just a few more and I could�ve gone to the moon in it; and with far less problems than the Apollo 13.


I can�t complain about my little Tercel.  It has done all I ever asked and more.  Like I said, I am not a mechanic so I have not been tweaking and refining its engine on the weekends.  I�ve been more like Mel Gibson and <i>The Road Warrior</i>, taking it many times across the Sonoran, Mojave, and Painted deserts, doing little more than keeping up its body fluids.

That�s one thing I have done right.  I�ve gotten to know the Q-lube and Jiffy Lube attendants very well every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, and they�ve been impressed how well my car is running.

I�m not going to mention that I went 231,000 miles before getting my first tune-up.  That would be too embarrassing!   The service guy told me that my Tercel could be listed in the Guinness Book of Records for having the nastiest looking spark plugs he�d ever seen!  I suppose that is why my engine warning light came on just a few thousand miles short of a full lunar landing.

So, after an overnight experience at the local dealer, my Tercel is chugging along and looking to put on another 200,000 to return back to Earth.

I never did name my car �- well, I do call it my �Baby Lexus� -� but it�s got its little quirks like any broken-in car.  Right now the air conditioner is inconsistent, but not totally broke -� meaning that it usually comes on a few minutes before I complete my commute home.  The passenger door doesn�t always unlock with my key but the other door and trunk are fine.  It�s also missing its left side mirror, but that isn�t the Tercel�s fault -� I�d blame that on the iron bar in my parking shade but that wouldn�t be quite fair either.

Any <i>real</i> drawbacks to the Tercel lie with its small size, but you wouldn�t be buying this if you weren�t looking for an inexpensive vehicle anyway.  A really large person would probably have to look elsewhere to get more room.  A few years ago I made the mistake of taking two �road warrior� trips of over 12 hours one way over two consecutive weekends.  During my second trip, my back began to hurt pretty badly and I had to pry myself up whenever I needed to stand up.

Other quibbles could come with its tiny jack and the little donut wheel they standardly pack for your spare.  Of course with any small vehicle you've got to keep your wits about you with all the huge semis on the road, but you do have an advantage squeezing into parking spaces that trucks can't even comprehend using.

Overall, I recommend this car highly if you�re looking for an economical car that doesn�t break down.  After all, the same engineers who designed the Lexus have designed the Tercel, so I trust their judgment. 

 And I trust my little Tercel.  It�s nearly got me to the moon.
