            Not long ago I purchased the Sony U10, the 1.3 megapixel version in the U-series of cameras.  I soon realized the limitations of that camera with it&#146s limited resolution, but on a recent trip to Circuit City, I noticed they were carrying the U20, a 2 megapixel version of the U10.  So, the VISA began to wiggle, and the U20 came home with me that day.

<b>Commonalities & Equipment</b> 

Anyone who has seen both cameras will tell almost immediately that they are nearly identical, except for coloring.  The U10 has more of a gray and &#147pearl&#148 color scheme with a metallic sliding lens cover on the front.  The U20 is a bit more ahem.. &#147masculine&#148 looking, having a mostly all-metallic look to it with dark gray accents (though the camera is not actually made of metal but heavy grade plastic).  Other than appearance, the only other difference between the two cameras is the U20&#146s top resolution of 1632 x 1224 pixels, as opposed to the 1280 x 960 limitation of the U10.

In the box, you will find a pair of NiMh rechargeable AAA sized batteries, and a battery charger.  The good news is that you can use any brand of NiMh batteries in the U20.  The bad news is that the charger takes over 10 hours to charge up those tiny batteries, so later on you&#146ll probably need to invest in a faster charger and/or a second set of batteries.  The camera will only work with NiMh batteries &#150 you cannot use AAA alkaline batteries as a Sony rep told me you risk damaging the camera&#146s circuitry by doing so, even if the camera would power up using them, so in order to make sure you do not void your warranty, stick with NiMh only.  &#147Pixela&#148 software is included with the camera which allows you to download your images into your computer, as well as make some minor and basic image adjustments;  good to get you started, but as you become more experienced you&#146ll want something better such as &#147Paint Shop Pro&#148, or, &#147Photoshop Elements 2.0&#148.  A neck strap is included, though a wrist strap would have been much more practical.  Check your local camera shop or cell phone kiosk at the mall for a wrist strap.  An 8 meg memory stick is included which allows for up to 15 images at the top image size - budget for a larger stick, (but they're cheap now so don't panic).

<b>Features</b>

The U20 is designed to be a &#147go anywhere&#148 snapshot camera.  A camera that is so portable you will take it places you may not normally want to lug around a larger more sophisticated digicam.  For this purpose, it fulfills its goal.  

As mentioned earlier, the U20 has a top image size of 1632 x 1224 pixels, placing it into the 2 megapixel category.  Powering up the camera by sliding the lens cover to the side will expose the tiny lens and flash, readying the camera in a second for photo taking.  Since the lens is so small, it does not quite capture as much detail as some larger 2 megapixel cameras on the market, so while you can get pretty good  4 x 6 prints from the U20, you cannot really crank it up to a good 5 x 7 as you can usually do in this pixel class.  It does well however, in capturing good color in the images.  There is also a 640 x 480 pixel mode for email-sized photos.  Unlike most digital cameras including Sony, there are NO  image quality settings for images in this camera (or the U10) such as &#147normal&#148, or &#147fine&#148, etc.  The camera automatically uses a fairly heavy compression to every image which you can see upon close inspection of the images if you view them at full size on your monitor.  &#147Artifacts&#148, which are distortions around the edges of objects are the result.   These will not show up in a 4 x 6 print however, as long as you use the top image size, but can be seen more easily in the 640 x 480 images.  No huge deal for this type of camera, but it would have been nice for Sony to have added adjustable settings for image quality in the menu.

The small 1 inch color LCD is fantastic considering it&#146s tiny size.  It does get a bit cluttered showing the image you&#146re about to take as well as camera settings, but again, considering the size, it&#146s very clear.  What stands out is that even in direct sunlight, you can still see the LCD and use it to compose images &#150 something many digital cameras still have a problem with.  You can also turn the LCD backlight off when outdoors, conserving battery power (which is pretty decent by the way).  

The menu is navigated by two small buttons and a toggle switch on the back of the camera, which are the only controls besides the mode switch and shutter button on top of the camera.  You can change image size, LCD lighting, insert time and date into your photos if you like, and select from various photo effects such as Sepia and Black and White, from the menu.  You can manually preset focus for close up shots (macro) or infinity,  but I found better luck just letting the camera&#146s auto focus do it&#146s thing at as close as 4 inches to the subject for macros. During image playback, you can erase just one image, or the whole memory stick..  A separate power button on top of the camera allows you to power up and view images you&#146ve taken without sliding the lens cover over &#150 a small touch, but welcome, as it puts less wear and tear on the camera.  The U20 offers a 15 second movie clip mode, but this is very disappointing.  Most digicams have a movie image size of 320 x 240 pixels as standard, but the U10 and U20 cameras only offer a 160 pixel sized movie clip (no sound).  This is so incredible small and pixely looking playback, it&#146s hard to even tell what&#146s in the moving images, so do not purchase this camera just for this feature as you&#146ll be disappointed.  There is no zoom (optical or digital) on either U-camera.

<b>Image Quality and Final Words</b>

The images from the smaller-pixeled U10 were fine for monitor viewing, emails, and maybe to insert into newsletters, but even small 4 x 6 prints were disappointing.  The U20 has enough extra resolution to solve this for most casual snap shooters, giving you enough extra pixels to produce presentable 4 x 6 prints as long as you&#146re using a good photo printer and paper.  You&#146ll pay for this added luxury however, as the U10 is dropping to around $169.00 in many U.S. stores, and the U20 is steady at $269.00.  Not horrible considering you get the batteries and that charger but $229.00 would be more appropriate.

Though there are some faults with this camera that keeps it from earning an &#147A+&#148 from me, I&#146d still recommend it to folks at long as you do realize it&#146s limitations.  I do find myself taking it just about everywhere with me, and have snagged shots I would never have been able to get when I don&#146t feel like taking my larger camera with me, so it&#146s great for that.  You can even get the U20 in black or dark blue if that pushes you a bit more to purchase one, but must order these colors from Sony&#146s web site directly.  If you don&#146t expect the world from the U20, but do expect to have fun with it, I think you&#146ll have just that &#150 fun.  Let your VISA wiggle, and buy one.
