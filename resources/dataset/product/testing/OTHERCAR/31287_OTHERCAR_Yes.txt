            I was wary when my husband suggested a station wagon. Warier still when I learned that the sticker price of his intended vehicle was hovering in the neighborhood of $40K. How could a STATION WAGON cost so much? Would it be worth it? Would I feel like a soccer mom driving it around? Would it move quickly, nimbly when needed? 

Well, all it took was one test drive. The seats are fantastic, and supportive--great for enduring the traffic. The car handles very well for such a heavy behemoth, although not as snappy as a sports model. You can't help but feel safe in it either, with its steel roll bars, and front and side air bags. This was a plus considering we'd eventually be toting around small children. We love the individual heat/air settings. The stereo and front/rear speakers are pretty good, too. But best of all, this is not your mother's station wagon. It looks great pulling into the valet parking for a swank restaurant, and great covered in mud and slush in the mountains. 

Aside from the superficial niceties of the car, we've had no trouble with the engine or mechanics at all. Smooth sailing. Maintenance is expensive, though. To get bars put on the car (in order to support a roof rack) was a costly item; the roof rack was even more, which is why we've yet to buy one. Be prepared. Servicing the car (regular maintenance items) also does not come cheaply.

The Volvo V70 wagon is the first car I've ever bought. And I haven't regretted it once. I recommend it to (obviously) people with kids, people into sports (lots of room for equipment and friends; get the racks thrown in at purchase if you can!), people into luxury cars (Yes, it IS luxuriously smooth to ride in this car), and people who want to make a good investment. (Volvos hold their value better than most cars). So, find a dealer, take a spin, and be prepared to sign the papers. It's worth it.<br><br>
