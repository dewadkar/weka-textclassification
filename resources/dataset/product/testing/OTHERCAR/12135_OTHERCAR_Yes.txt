            I've driven a lot of cars.  I work in a car rental agency that carries GM, Dodge, Mitsubishi, Hyundai, and Toyota; before this I worked in another that dealt in Ford and Nissan.  I've also driven a few exotics: Porsche Boxter and BMW Z3, as well as many Jaguars.  So, needless to say, I'm accustomed to almost every basic consumer-level car available in the U.S., and then some.  I've spent tons of time driving all these cars, so I have lots to compare to.  Of course, these are all brand-new cars (2000-2003), but that only sweetens the relative comparisons I'm about to make.

Put simply, the Honda Prelude could possibly be the best used car ever built.

Imagine, if you will, a car that's quick when you floor the gas pedal, turns like it's on rails as soon as you touch the steering wheel, a shifter that's smooth as a hot knife cutting through butter, styled with shapes and lines found on today's cars--AND it's reliable?  Good on gas?  Easy to maintain?

Yes, it's a Honda.  And Prelude is its name.

The 93 Honda Prelude VTEC is an appreciable alternative to boring econo-boxes and all-out powerful muscle cars.  Straddling the lines that define and seperate both categories, the Prelude is an ideal compact sports car that can be had for a fairly inexpensive amount.  Other used cars in this price range cannot boast the number of qualities that make the Prelude as desirable as it is.

It is powered by a 190HP powerplant, capable of 0-60 in 6.7 secs; not bad for a little 4-banger.  This model Prelude is the first production-level Honda to feature Honda's VTEC technology (the 1991 Acura NSX was the first to utilize VTEC's technology).  The VTEC system (which is an acronym for Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) changes the valve timing on-the-fly (somewhat like Toyota's newer VVTI technology).  It's an interesting feature, but essentially what it means to its driver is the car will gain a boost in acceleration at 5200 RPMs (redline at 7400).  Though a turbocharger would provide significantly more output, you stand a much greater chance of blowing a turbocharged engine than you would with natural aspiration.  This is what makes the car fast, yet reliable and good on gas, too (22 city, 26 highway).

Hondas are known for bland styling, and the Prelude is somewhat of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, a lady friend of mine does not believe this is a 93.  The original designers had visions of the future when they designed the exterior of the Prelude, as its image holds up among today's ultra-modern  cars.  It is very much comparable to the Acura RSX, Nissan Sentra, and Ford Mustang (though the latter hasn't been changed in 10 years or so...).  

On the other hand, once she sits in the car, she realizes it's a blast from the past.  The interior leaves a lot to be desired; it is simple, functional, yet drab and somewhat cold.  There is only a tachometer, speedometer, electronic oil pressure gauge and fuel gauge, and... well, that's all.  You'd figure a performance car would have more to look at, more dials, indicators, and such; I would have appreciated an engine temperature indicator, at least.  It does have your standard warning lights: check engine, ABS, seat belt, etc., but I feel the dash could be a little more detailed.  I have taken care of that with an aftermarket stereo and equalizer, so I have plenty to look at and fiddle with now.

The seats are firm, but probably good only for short trips.  I once took a 4-hour trip and didn't mind the ride at all, but I could see how finicky people could feel uncomfortable.  Then again, finicky people probably don't drive sports cars such as these.  Rear seats are pretty much useless for adults, or even children.  Best left to carry a backpack or some bags.  The window switches take some getting used to, as they are on the door, perpendicular to the driver.  At first, I was very put off by their arrangement, but have since then grown used to it.

Handling in this car is excellent.  In no other car have I ever felt so much control over what I am doing.  The car takes turns with precision, even at high speeds.  There is some evidence of torque steer (being a front-wheel-drive car, this is to be expected), but this is minimal if you simply use a little caution.  Better this than to spin out of control in a rear-wheel-drive, I suppose.  I haven't felt this attached to the road since I fell off my bike when I was 5.  This is Prelude's strongest point and one that is easily overlooked if you have not driven many cars.

Overall, I am very happy with my car.  I've had it for a year and a half and will probably keep this car forever.  I plan to grow old with it and show it to my grandkids, since no one's going to make one like this anymore.  I also fear I will not have the same luck with other cars as I have with this one, since this is really one in a million.  Among all the brand-new cars I've driven, none has the style and grace as the Prelude.
