            This is the hottest little car I have ever driven/owned.  It is extremely comfortable and doesn't &quot;feel&quot; like a small car.  Like some other small cars, when you get in you feel like you are dropping down into the seat, you don't feel this way with the Cabrio.  It feels like you are sitting up in a full size car. I love the fact that the roll bar is welded onto and is a part of the car.  Not just a pretty feature.  It is so easy to drive and handle.  We love putting the convertible top down and just cruising.  We put our poodle in the backseat and strap him into his harness via the seatbelt and take off.  He loves it because he doesn't have to stick his head out of the window.  He just has to breathe in all the smells.  <br><br>
