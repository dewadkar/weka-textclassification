            What I mean by my title is a few years back, I owned a 1976 Chevy Mailbu. It was one long ass car, but it drove like you wouldn't beleive. This car took anything. What I mean by that, is it outlasted my older brother, my dad, and me-which is a task in itself. It is an easy car to maintain by yourself which doesn't really matter, because since it is a Chevy and none the less, a Malibu-it never needs to be fixed anyway. I would say that the only bad thing about a Malibu is that when they finally decide they have had enough, and the one time it breaks down-it breaks down for good. But don't worry, you definetly get your money's worth. Email me if you want to know more k?  <br><br>
