            We purchased our 2002 Envoy SLT 4wd in November of 2002.  This was the last 2002 on the lot (a dealer demo), and we were trying to get in on the 0% financing.  We immediately liked the Envoy's looks, and many of the gadgets it had.  We were very very close to getting a Yukon, but since my mother doesn't enjoy driving things that drive like trucks, the Envoy was a sensible choice for us.  The I6 engine is very powerful, but sometimes can be loud when really trying to haul out.  The ride quality is good for the most part, but the riders of the back seat may feel the bumps more.  The back seat is okay for 2 adults, but 3 would be pushing it.  One major complaint that I have is the rear wheel well juts right out into the door opening, making it hard to get out without opening the door fully and banging whatever's on the other side.  

The interior quality of this vehicle is lacking greatly.  The whole atmosphere feels like a car that is probably about $10,000 less in price, not a $33000 luxury SUV.  The fake wood trim is just that--fake.  The leather is of mediocre quality, and the controls are adequate.  I do like the radio and speaker system, they provide ample bass.  The cargo area of the vehicle is fine for carrying small things, but the seats must be folded down to carry large items.
