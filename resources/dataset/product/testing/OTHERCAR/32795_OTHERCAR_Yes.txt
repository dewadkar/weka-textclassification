            OK look I don't really like domestic cars; but, for the Corvette I must admit Chevrolet you got something now here.  The Corvette is one of the very, very few domestic cars that I would ever buy.  Its sleek design and massive horsepower is haunting.  The old saying that domestic cars are 
&quot;only good at going in a straight line&quot; doesn't fit the Corvette.  The massive tires provide for better handling and its sharp curves make the car very aerodynamic.  Overall, the car is very good at turning and handling.  One of its flaws may be the gas it takes.  This is one of the many reassons I don't like the domestic market.  The Corvettes massive engine doesn't really meet up to its cylinder to horsepower ratio.  But, hey somebody who can afford this baby doesn't have to worry to much about that.  Right?<br><br>
