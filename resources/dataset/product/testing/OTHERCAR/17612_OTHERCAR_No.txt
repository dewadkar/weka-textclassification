            As a former owner of a Dodge Shadow (Plymouth Sundance) it was only natural that I would look to the same company which made my first new car ever for it's replacement. I was disenheartened to find that they had discontinued the Shadow/Sundance line to produce the Neon line but decided to give it a go.

It took me about a whole 2 days to decide that the problems in keeping the car on the road were not in my driving skills, but rather stemmed from the light weight frame of the car causing it to blow all over creation. It ran great skirting around town, in and out small roads, and parking in small spots, but take it up on the highway for those hour-each-way commutes to/from work and I soon found my arm aching from battling the wind of trucks and mother nature.

The real &quot;fun&quot; with driving the Neon started when we had our first snowfall. Combine cross winds of 40mph with 4&quot; of slush and foot tall grooves to change lanes (oh yea, what lanes) and, well, the picture is anything but pretty. I'm happy to say that the car and I survived the winter unscathed and even happier to report that I turned in our lease for something a little heavier and heartier (Caravan - love it!)

Happy &amp; safe driving!
