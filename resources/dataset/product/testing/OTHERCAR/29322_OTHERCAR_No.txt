            We bought our Tracker because was recommend and the price was right at the time. The vehicle is ok  for running around town and short runs. It has just enough power for city driving can get up on the freeway with out worrying about getting run over by faster traffic. The problems come in if you want to do camping with a family as it is small and there is not a lot of room. also can not tow any thing as the motors are to small and the drive train could not handle it. Also for long drive the vehicle is to light and most trucks and larger cars that pass you cause the hole truck to shake and pull some. For a small family (I.E. 2 adults one child)
it has just enough room for short trips. On long trips the vehicle will shack you to death. <br><br>
