            All Jeep vehicles have a well deserved reputation of being a tough truck.
While the Grand Cherokee is no truck, it is indeed tough as nails.
     With the optional 5.2 liter V-8, acceleration is a sheer joy.  Passing those slow trucks on large hills is no sweat of this Jeeps brow.  Even under the hardest acceleration, the engine noise from the big V-8 is nicly muffled, and during normal highway driving, the engine is very well muted.  The automatic transmission is the smoothest in its class.  No other sport utility of this size comes close to the Jeep.  Even under hard acceleration, the tranny shifts smooth and quiet.  There is no sudden power surge on up-shift like some other SUV's out there.  There is also a  button that will take the transmission out of overdrive, especially nice while towing a boat or camper up a steep grade hill, or while passing other vehicles.  
     Of course, the fuel ecconomy of such a powerfull SUV leaves a little to be desired.  The V-8 is a thirsty one.  The average is 15 MPG city, and 19 MPG highway.  While that may not be as nice as the other V-6 powered SUV's, if you plan to tow anything, or just like to have the SUV with the fastest 0-60 time, the Grand Cherokee is for you.  
     The interior is spacious, and the front seats sit high enough to get comfortable, while still allowing head room for the tallest of drivers.  The radio is a bit out of reach, as it sits high upon the dash.
While the climate controls are easy to read, and the 2 large dials are easy to control.  The lever to shift to 4 wheel drive is easy to reach when the going gets tough.  While the test Jeep had full time 4 wheel drive, Other Jeeps use 2 wheel drive as the main driving gear, and the option to shift to 4 high or 4 low as needed.  The rear seats are comfortable for the average adult, and they fold flat to expand the allready cavernous rear storage area.
     This is a tough 4x4, capable of exploring deep into the woods, hauling kids and groceries, or what ever you can dish out, this Jeep will be there.<br><br>
