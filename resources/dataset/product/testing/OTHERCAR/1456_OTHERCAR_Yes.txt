            I bought my Saturn SC2 based upon appearance, quality, performance and cost - but primarily cost.  The list of things I love about the vehicle is long, while the list of negatives is short.  Heading the list of POSITIVES is looks - a sharp, stylish, sporty 2-dr coupe.  As to quality, I have driven my Saturn, a '96 model, for three years with only one unscheduled repair being made, of course covered by warranty.  Performance-wise, considering the car cost much less than many 2-dr sport coupes on the market, it is surprising and fun to drive.  The engine is only 1.9 liters but puts out 124 horsepower, and coupled with the four-speed, electronic automatic transmission, it provides quickness, agility and more than enough power to both accelerate beautifully in those necessary situations that occur in day-to-day driving or cruise for hours on the interstate at legal speed - and more.  It is actually fun to drive.  The negatives?  Not very roomy, an almost non-existent back seat and just a bit too small overall - Having a short wheelbase means the ride is not especially luxurious and very long drives can result in one beginning to feel a bit &quot;crowded&quot; and requiring perhaps more than the usual &quot;rest&quot; stops to stretch.  One looking for a fun, sporty driver around the town and community and who does not have more than one passenger to take along will find the car perfect.  Folks who drive a lot of long miles, and who have growing families should perhaps look for something slightly larger and with more built-in comfort.<br><br>
