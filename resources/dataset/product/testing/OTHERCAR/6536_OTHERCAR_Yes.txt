            I was a reluctant minivan owner.  I had a little import that shuttled my 2 boys and my husband and me around just fine.  Then we found out their was going to be an addition to the little group.  The import would still seat everyone, but the word comfort would have to be deleted from our vocabulary.  

My in-laws purchased us an 1986 Plymouth Grand Voyager.  It was 10 years old by then, hadn't been driven much for about 2 years and didn't have any luxuries except that it seated 8 people.  Hey, who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth.  It was free transportation and we would fit with room to spare.  That was a major consideration due to the fact that my family is in Ohio, his family is in Georgia, and we live in North Carolina.  That van lasted only about a year, but our need for a van had been established.  

We finally found our second van one afternoon after searching all the local dealerships for &quot;just the right one.&quot;  &quot;I'll know it when I see it&quot; was my mantra.  I did.  This one was a 1995 Grand Caravan SE.  It had captains chairs instead of the bench so we lost one passenger, but it was nicer, newer, and green.  I had my husband check it out mechanically and we brought it home.  I loved it.  At least I did until someone decided to park their Jeep Cherokee in the hatch.  

We spent the next year looking for another van.  At that point I was working at a Chevrolet Dealership.  I had previously worked for a Dodge/Chrysler dealership so I was familiar with nearly all makes and models of minivans.  What I didn't know was pretty easy for me to find out.  We considered the Chevy Venture, the Pontiac Montana and another Grand Caravan.  Ventures and G. Caravans were easy to find.  Montanas, not so.  

I happen to believe in purchasing a preowned vehicle for the economy.  One day, someone traded in a Grand Caravan LE.  I phoned my husband to come right away and we drove it home that evening.  I had now driven each stage of the Caravan's life cycle.  This van handles exceedingly well.  It has a powerful engine.  We again have captains chairs.  This time we have the dual sliding doors, which I think are a must.  

The seats are easy to remove, but can be a little cumbersome to re-install.  Additionally, only one second-row seats lifts to allow access to the third seat.  It would be more convenient if both seats lifted to allow easy access from either side of the van.We have dual climate for the front passengers, as well as rear heat and air, which is also a must.  

The only concern that I have with my van is the transmission.  Ours was rebuilt at 78,000 miles after it no longer wished to leave second gear on our way to Ohio, literally.  We took it to our local dealership and the work was completed.  We did have to take it back once to fix a leak, but 3000 miles later have had no problems.<br><br>
