            I test drove this car just to kill time as my old car was being appraised and bought it an hour later.  I like how it is has the suv size, but handles like a much smaller car. It is not as clumsy and big as the jeep and allows the driver to whip in and out of traffic. It also seems much roomier in the interior and the seats are more comfy.  The cr-v is also great for tailgating and camping as it comes equipped with a table and cooler.  The seats can also be turned into a bed quickly and easily. I had to sleep in my car for a week one time and it was actually surprisingly comfy. I've really grown to like my cr-v and hope it is not repossessed because of lack of payments on my part.<br><br>
