            My parents bought this vehicle (93' Nissan Maxima) because it was very sturdy and a heavy car.  (Which a few years later may have been what possibly saved my sister's life in an automobile accident.)

I LOVE this car because it has nice looks, a great ride, handles conditions well and is very sturdy.
I think the road noise could be better though.

Driving this vehicle is actually quite fun.  My sister was in a car accident, hit broadside and went into three spins.  If she had been in any vehicle that weighed less then the Maxima, the vehicle would have flipped over and who knows what would have happened after that.  The car did have several thousands of dollars worth of damage and was border line as far as being totalled.  We did not have it totalled because it is such a great car , we did not wanna let it go.

Then, I was put in a driving situation where either I was gonna get over in the other lane (someone's big metal ladder had fallen off their truck) quickly or let the car behind me rear end me.  Not only did this take quick thinking but it also took good traction and the 93' Nissan Maxima had what it takes.  

The brakes on this model could be better.  They squeak way too much and we have to put it in the shop a lot for that!

Personally, I (I am 16) do not like the body style of the 95 and up Maximas.  I think 95 was when they changed body styles but Im not real sure on that.  Anyway, I prefer the body style they had before. 

I recommend this car for anyone!  Teenagers and parents especially though would enjoy this car.  <br><br>
