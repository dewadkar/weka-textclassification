            I owned the 1991 Rodeo LS 2WD - It saved my life! We were in a major accident, head on, and I was unrestrained. I hit the windshield, but did not go through it. I splattered the windshield with my head, but was uncut! According to the insurance man, this truck was made of steel in the front, and it took the beating that I should have taken in the wreck!
This happened in 1997,and my truck was paid for,so the insurance paid to fix it, instead of totaling it out. They put $8,500 into a truck that wasn't worth that much! Everyone knows that a truck that has been &quot;repaired&quot; never is the same. I ended up trading the vehicle in 1999, and only because the Rodeo is not made with a 3rd seat in the rear, I had to buy a Durango! I wanted another Rodeo, but we needed that 3rd seat for the kids to have space, with their friends.(they are old enough now that I am a &quot;taxi&quot; service for them) If Rodeo ever comes out with a 3rd seat in the rear, I will trade the Durango in a heart beat for a new Rodeo. Hey maybe this is an idea that Isuzu needs to hear???!!!!<br><br>
