            After a lot of research, and hunting for the best deal, we purchased this camera for Christmas of 2000.  We were pleased with it right from the start.

It was easy to learn how to operate it. It has a lot of neat features, but isn't too complicated. It does everything that we have needed it to do thus far.

We mostly take general pictures of events, family gatherings and use it to document the growth and activities of our toddler. It has always done a fantastic job of capturing the moment for us!

Until just recently, we only used it for online photo viewing, so the resolution didn't matter much. But, now that we just got a new printer, we have been printing photos from this camera, and have been very impressed with the results!  We no longer need our film camera at all.


Another great feature of this camera is the macro setting. I recently went on an outing to a place that had butterflies that you could get really close to. I enjoyed the heck out of taking great close up photos of these beauties, and was awed by the quality of the images.

Best of all is the price of this camera. We were able to get it on special with a $50 rebate. So we paid only $200.00 for it, and it even came with a free 32 meg smart media card! 

If you don't get a 32 meg card, I highly recommend that you purchase one.. as it holds a lot more photos before becoming full. We have only filled up the 32 meg card once. When we did fill it up, we discovered another very useful feature of the camera, you are able to delete photos from it selectively in order to free up more pictures to take.

The only thing that has really bugged me about this camera is the amount of time it takes to write to the card... sometimes it can take up to 10 seconds to do so. Another pet peeve of mine is that it takes a second for it to take the picture once you click the button.. this can cause you to loose the picture you were wanting, when you are dealing with an active toddler.  I have learned to pre-focus (hold the button slightly down) and then fully click when ready for the photo.

Overall, I would say that I am very pleased with the performance of our camera. We weren't in the market for a really expensive camera, and frankly I don't think we will ever the "top of the line" model for our use. 

I am glad that we looked into the different types and prices before settling on this one. I think the research paid off!
