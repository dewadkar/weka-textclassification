            I recently purchased my used '97 Saturn. I was quite skeptical at first. But after owning it now for awhile, I wouldn't trade it for anything. It drives like a dream, a big surprise for such a small car. I have owned many different cars by many different manufacturers, and my Saturn is my favorite. It gets great gas mileage, about 40 miles per gallon on the highway. It has quite a bit of pep for a mere 4 cylinder. I traded in a slightly larger car for the Saturn and was very suprised to find that the Saturn had more head and leg room. Cab forwarding design really does work. They fit alot into the small cab without sacrificing the much needed space. It's a great design and a wonderful car.<br><br>
