            Let me start out by saying that I love cars. I bought this car with the intention of modifying it in order to make it faster but before I had the chance too, things started to go south. The engine apparently had 40K on it (rebuilt at 90K) but the transmission was original with 130K. That is where the problem was. The 2nd gear synchro went out on me which is NOT uncommon with these cars. If you intend on buying one make sure you get the transmission checked out by a mechanic. They are notorious for failing. The engine on these cars is very powerful and smooth but it is not uncommon for them to also go out. It's mostly little things that bothered me like squeaks and rattles, electrical problems, and losing oil and not being able to find out where. On the plus side, the car is a 2.0 DOHC Turbocharged Inline 4 cylinder. It has a sidemount intercooler located by the passenger side wheel well.  The engine in manual/awd form makes 195HP. In manual/fwd turbo form it makes 190HP and in automatic/awd/fwd turbo forms it makes just 180HP. I do not reccomend getting the automatic with this car. It is much more fun to drive manual and you make the most out of the engine with this combination. The turbo comes soon and strong and it pulls very hard all the way to redline (7K) although the rev limiter is at 7500 rpm. The 4G63 is a very rev happy engine and shifting at 7500 rpm every now and then on a spirited fun run won't hurt things. The car is very comfortable for 2 people, but for anything more than that it is not. The gas mileage is approximately 20 in the city and 24 on the highway. Not great but not bad either. Paint on these cars is bad. It easily fades if not properly taken care of. Red and black are notorious for fading. Some things to remember when buying a Talon/Eclipse is be damn sure the timing belt was changed at the 60K intervals, and if you are not sure it was done then DO IT. It is a ticking time bomb if not changed every 60k and the belt will not hesitate to snap and cause severe head damage. The brakes on this car are fairly weak and should be upgraded to a larger diameter rotor. A cheap and easy upgrade is to just get Mitsubishi Diamante/3000GT or Dodge Stealth front brake rotors. They will help you stop much better. Overall, I would say that this is a good car. The reliability is iffy but if you take car of it and do all the regular maintenance, you should be fine. Take care of it and it takes care of you. Remember to use 91+ octane gas otherwise you make get some knock. This car is not for someone who doesn't have any basic mechanical knowledge of cars. Get a Talon/Eclipse and FLYYYYYYYY!
