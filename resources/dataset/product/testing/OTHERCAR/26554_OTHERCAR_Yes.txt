            As usual, I agonized over this purchase and wore out the web looking at corporate sites, "fan" sites and shopping comparison sites. I also went to a couple of old fashioned bricks/mortar stores (how quaint) and actually handled as many of the competing cameras that I could get my hands on. There is really an amazing level of difference between digital cameras in terms of design and feature sets and this makes for quite a complex purchase decision. Just looking at all the $500 cameras, you'll notice that they all look different, have slightly different specifications, use a variety of storage and battery schemes - and these often reflect meaningful differences in how the camera works and how it can be used. Anyway, as you may have surmised, after hashing all of this out, I ended up choosing the <b>Minolta DImage 5</b>. For some reason, this camera has not gotten that much coverage, much less glowing reviews (and this is currently the only Epinion). I will attempt to set that record straight to some extent by giving the DImage 5 a very strong recommendation.

The D5 is physically identical to the more costly D7. I actually could not find a store that carried the D5 near me and did my hands-on with a D7. The structure and shape of the camera is excellent. Unlike some digital image capture devices, these Minolta models look and behave pretty much like cameras. One of the apparent competitions in digital camera design seems to be making them as small and elegant as possible. Thats all well and good in terms of the thing sitting in your pocket; but taking photos with one of these miniscule smooth rectangular boxes is quite different. Try it for yourself but it is almost impossible to properly hold and operate some of these tiny cameras. The D5 fits your hand - in terms of size/weight/balance/control placement - just like a well designed 35mm film camera. Construction seems to be sturdy and apparently a solid magnesium body underlies the exterior aspects. My only construction beef so far has been the rubber surround on the movable electronic viewfinder (EV) which has ripped slightly. I feel this is mostly due to my camera case which is a very tight fit and this viewfinder kind of sticks out and takes a hit when going in/out.

The <b>control aspects</b> of the D5 are outstanding and Minolta has done an excellent job in distributing common adjustments between several easily accessed controls. The scheme of a left-hand side mounted control that selects between things like "ASA", white balance, compensation factors, etc coupled with a right-hand finger wheel to make the actual adjustment is inspired and makes it extremely easy to change these things on the fly (w/ very clear read-out of the parameter being changed in your EV/screen). Then to keep from cluttering up this system too much you also have dedicated controls such as the main switch which selects record/play modes, etc, the program exposure button which selects the different program modes, a separate EV/Display control, focus mode control, plus the usual nested menus on the display for less frequently used parameters. This kind of control flexibility is VERY important in getting the most out of a complex camera and makes the <b>very flexible</b> D5 <b>very easy to use</b>. A lot of these competing cameras seem to have equally flexible control - in terms of the parameters available - but actually adjusting these parameters often requires navigating through a nested menu structure on the display. This is not something you can do on the fly.

The <b>display quality</b> on the D5 seems first rate to me. I've seen some complaints about the electronic viewfinder being too dim or having artifacts. Having shot in several low-light situations, I have not found it to be too dim. I have very occasionally noticed these artifacts (horizontal lines, etc) but this never bothered me or affected useability. I like the electronic viewfinder very much, in fact, and tend to use this over the rear display - which saves batteries also. A lot of cameras at this price point do have optical viewfinders besides a digital display. However, some kind of EV display is simply required here due to the 7x focal range of the D5's lens. The cost of creating a similarly zooming optical viewfinder would be well beyond reasonable at this price point. Note that the D5 is not really a single lens <b>reflex</b> (SLR) camera as it is described in the Epinion listing - i.e the viewing system is distinct from the actual lens optics.  

And of course there are <b>advantages</b> to the EV display design - as it can tilt up 90 degrees. This has come in handy on a couple of low angle occasions. Furthermore, you can use the EV just like you do the regular display i.e. to view images,etc. The standard rear image display and menu system on the D5 are great also. Shots can be quickly examined and deleted  using a quick review/trash button. In play mode you can magnify the image several times which helps a lot in checking focus quality and an image histogram is available for evaluating exposure if you are so inclined.

The <b>lens</b> on the D5 is one of the main reasons I was drawn to this model. I can't understand why anyone would be satisfied purchasing cameras at this price point that either lack any <b>zoom lens</b> or have a 2:1 or something (pay no attention to "digital" zoom factors). Obviously on a basic consumer camera like this you are pretty much stuck with the lens you get. I feel like I need a fairly wide range zoom lens just to frame basic shots much less to have a wide angle and telephoto option. I have been very pleased with the zoom range of the D5's lens. Note that this is a different lens than on the D7 - both are <b>7:1</b> but on the D7 this range starts from a wider angle. I think this is requires a more expensive design/construction (in dealing with the small form factor of the image sensors in these cameras). Actually, I would rather have this wider angle lens but the existing wide angle limit on the D5 is fine and I have not had cause to complain yet. 

An important point is that the zoom on the D5 is completely <b>manual</b>. You grab the lens barrel and twist it until you like what you see -there are no buttons or motor drive to control zoom. This was another big drawing card for me. It is simply a much better way to control framing - quicker, more <b>accurate</b>, more <b>intuitive</b> and it burns <b>no battery power</b>. However - my one beef with the D5's lens is that focus is not truly manual. There is a focus ring on the lens and while twisting this is obviously much more intuitive than manipulating some rocker switch or tiny knob -this ring still just operates as an electronic control driving an internal focus motor. I guess it was just too expensive or impractical to combine the auto focus system with a true manual ring on the actual lens. The focus ring on the D5 works fine (you have to select manual focus by pushing a button to make it "live") but it takes some getting used to. 

What about the <b>autofocus system</b>? This is a very complicated subject and one that I've seen hashed out on several "fan" sites. Minolta apparently has some proprietary contrast-based AF technology. They claim, of course, that this is superior to competing technology. From what I can tell, the consensus seems to be that it is no better and no worse overall. Apparently it works better with some subjects and worse with others. Having owned several different AF cameras, I am perfectly satisfied with the speed/accuracy of AF on the D5. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. At least you have clear indication in the EV/display as to what is going on. The <b>focus point</b> (this is very adjustable and flexible - you can even manually move it around the frame) is clearly indicated and at the end of the 1-2 seconds of "hunting" you are notified if the AF has "worked". 

Lets talk a little about <b>"resolution"</b>. I think this one of the more over-stressed aspects of these cameras. The D5 is a <b>"3 megapixel" camera</b>.  I would urge you not to buy a camera based solely on this parameter. I actually chose the D5 over the "5 megapixel" D7 due to performance issues that I saw brought up several times in D7 reviews - derived in part from the higher MP sensor. The more costly D7 is apparently notorious for sluggish operation and other issues related to dealing with/writing all these pixels. In my experience there are very very few instances when you are going to be using any real pixel-derived resolution above say <b>1-2 Megapixels</b> in printing images from one of these cameras. I have NEVER had my camera set above a 2 megapixel file size. I have printed several gorgeous full frame <b>8x10 prints</b> (more on this below) from such JPEG files and believe me there is absolutely no "resolution" issue. The concept that a 4 Megapixel camera is "better" in some way than a 2 or 3 MP camera is pretty esoteric and of little real-world value - unless you plan on making poster-sized prints or need to super-"enlarge" ("digital zoom" or Photoshop) sections of your image files. And as I mentioned, when you take a 4MP+ "photo" -the electronics of the camera has to deal with capturing and writing all this data to the card. This can take awhile and can considerably slow down the whole process.

O.K - so how do <b>images</b> taken with the D5 look? They look <b>great</b>. As mentioned, you can take images in a fairly wide variety of formats from raw 3MP files to highly JPEG compressed VGA files. File size and format is easily adjusted and indicated in the display. The format I use is a 2 MP file with the least level of JPEG. I have been using my D5 since Christmas Day (a gift from Wonderful Wife, thanks) but I have waited to write this review until I had obtained a photo printer and had some experience making prints. 

NOW: one of the other main reasons I selected the D5 is that it uses <b>Print Image Matching</b> (PIM) - the color space/control standard developed by Epson and camera manufacturers. Every review I have seen of PIM has said it clearly offers a better way to print digital photos with noticeably better color,etc. PIM allows the camera and printer to communicate within a <b>higher range of colors</b> - beyond the standard image file formats normally used. This makes for more natural looking prints - more like film. I have to say that my experience supports this. I purchased an <b>Epson Stylus 820</b> photo-quality printer (a steal at $100 after rebate) that uses PIM and have made a dozen or so 5x7 and 8x10 prints using Epson premium glossy photo paper. I have been really delighted with the results. 

Using PIM is not completely straightforward as if you open, manipulate, and save a file with a regular image editing program you can lose PIM information. I am still figuring this out and even the Minolta and Epson image manipulation software seem to generate files that have lost PIM after some manipulation. So, a lot of my printing has been done outside of the PIM system and these prints still look beautiful. However, I have made a couple attempts at just opening unmanipulated files in the basic Epson printing software (very nice)and just printing using PIM. I selected what seemed to be a nicely exposed, colorful shot- a classic "snapshot" of Wonderful Wife posing with a Bahamian police officer on the wharf in Nassau. It was early afternoon, a spectacular sunny day. WW was wearing an electric blue silk blouse and the background was cruise ships/water/palm trees. The 8x10 PIM print I got from this image is <b>amazing</b> and if anything exceeded my expectations of the quality of print I could get from a digital camera. The colors are perfect and bright and the print is razor sharp with beautiful contrast. It is the kind of shot you see under the glass at your local photo developer (haven't been to one of those in awhile) touting the quality of their services. SO: I assume that PIM played a role in the result here and this is an example of the quality you can get from the D5. 

I've taken/printed plenty of lesser shots also and of course you often have to adjust brightness/contrast/color saturation,etc to get a nice looking final image. (I use PaintShopPro7 and love it). My understanding is that you can make adjustments to contrast and a few other parameters and crop etc using PIM compatible software - save the file and still retain PIM information for printing. However I am still figuring this out. Also note that the D5 is very flexible in allowing adjustment of contrast/sharpness/color saturation during shooting.

What about the <b>logistics</b> of using the D5? Well, another reason I chose it was its use of <b>standard AA-size batteries</b>. Of course, you can't use real AA batteries on a camera like this. You absolutely have to use <b>high-power rechargeables</b>. So plan on doing this from the beginning. I purchased 2 sets (4@) of <b>Maha 1700 mAh</b> batteries and a Maha charger plus a car cord. These are consistently the highest rated rechargeables out there and apparently out-perform all of the standard brands. I think this all cost about $40 bucks or so online. I have been VERY pleased with these batteries. I have no specific idea about # of shots, etc and I think this is kind of a silly measure because you are doing so many different things with the camera - reviewing prior shots, using the display sometimes,sometimes not, using flash sometimes,etc etc etc. 

All I can tell you is that a set of batteries lasts for at least <b>2-3 solid days</b> of doing all this - i.e on vacation taking a shot or two every few hours. And of course you just carry your second set and switch out when you need to. This system works great to me and is much better/cheaper than having some proprietary rechargeable battery/charger system that you have to buy a $70 spare for or God forbid being stuck with some non-rechargeable like a C5A that will be another $12 or so every few days. Face it - all of these cameras eat up batteries and being able to use standard rechargeables like the Mahas is a HUGE advantage. 

I've seen complaints that the battery life of these Minolta models is not as good as some other cameras. It might sound funny but to me the fact that one camera will supposedly take 50 shots and another will take 100 is kind of a dubious advantage - (unless you are burning through a set of batteries in a few hours or something which is definitely not the case with the D5). These rechargeables can be recharged 1000s of times now w/o memory effect and regardless of how long one set will last you HAVE to have another set on hand - so what's the big deal about going a little longer on one set? I would much rather have the advantage of standard AA-form over a proprietary battery that will power the camera slightly longer.

The D5 uses <b>Compact Flash</b> cards which is another slight advantage to me. These are a little bigger than some of the other card form factors but of course the D5 is relatively big so its not like this is an issue. Compact Flash seem to be a little cheaper and more available and currently you have the most storage capacity with these considering you can use an IBM microdrive w/ <b>GB</b> of storage if you need it.

I just have a <b>64MB</b> CF card and this gives me well over <b>60 shots</b> at the 2MB/minorJPEGcomp format that I use. I just about used this capacity up on a recent week long cruise (see my Celebrity Millennium review)so I guess another 64MB card might be worthwhile to have. Getting your shots out is theoretically easy - sticking your CF into a reader. I actually end up using the USB cable directly from the camera most of the time and this works fast and just fine. I don't have a card reader yet and the PCMIA adapter I do have for my CF (to just stick it into a card slot on my laptop) seems to be problematic as the computer only seems to recognize the card (as a virtual drive) on the first time you stick it in and then you have to uninstall it every time to get it to recognize it again. 

So what's wrong with the D5? I imagine that some will find the relatively <b>large size</b> to be a drawback. As I've discussed, not me. Also some people seem to think they are going to use a digital camera like this to record video (although none of these really do this well) and while the D5 can create short video files it does not have a <b>microphone</b> to include sound. I've heard from others that they consider this a "must-have" feature. Don't really understand this concept but if that is the case with you then the D5 won't be appropriate. I've been racking my brain for other drawbacks and I can't really come up with any.

I'll end with some real world usage stories on the D5. I was in Manhattan a few months ago and wanted to take some shots of the Chrysler Bld (as Wonderful Wife until recently worked there). It was a COLD evening as the sun was setting and lights were coming on all over the city. I quickly tried to get some shots of the building w/ the evening sky in the background. I ended up having to adjust several parameters including manually setting the "ASA" to a slower speed to avoid getting too much noise (otherwise the camera defaults to a faster "speed" which just kicks up the gain). I was doing this in gloves and steadying the camera against a nearby phone pole. In the end I got a very nice exposure at maximum zoom of the top of the illuminated building through some bare trees and the still-light evening sky behind. I mention this because I felt this was a pretty critical task under somewhat difficult conditions and the flexible, well-placed controls made getting this shot pretty easy. Also, as mentioned I've taken the camera on a couple of recent trips. The aforementioned cruise was kind of a shake-down for the camera and I was very pleased with my results - while still really learning the ropes. The camera was no problem carting around from place to place and my tiny Maha charger and batteries packed and worked quite well. I also had the D5 with me on a recent trip to DC and got a bunch of excellent shots of sculpture and paintings using natural light in several of the museums. 

Despite the great length of this review, I've still not really gone into several basic aspects like flash  operation and exposure control - which are both very good. The bottom line is that I am obviously very pleased with the D5  and would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a <b>flexible</b> and <b>well-designed</b> digital camera. Obviously new cameras are coming out all the time with more pixels and extra features. However, I think the <b>feature set</b> and <b>performance</b> of the D5 really satisfy the necessary requirements for capturing and printing great images - and what more do you really need beyond that?
