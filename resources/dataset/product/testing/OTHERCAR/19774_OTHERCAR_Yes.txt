               I own a 1992 Subaru Loyale wagon with all wheel drive, this car has proven itself to be as delicate as an anvil.The primary attraction of this car for me is,Fuji Heavy Industries builds ocean going freighters, so I thought they could build something with a fair amount of skill that would last. So far this logic has played out, 146,000 miles with routine maintenance.This is a very crude car however, lots of wind and road noise, noisy and unrefined engine and transmission(I can only speak about the 5 speed), and it does not even have what I would describe as a lack of power. Having said all of that it is still one of the best cars I've owned.
   At its advanced state of use everything still works, A/C, all power accessories, windows, locks, 4WD system, mirrors, EVERYTHING! Squeaks and rattles are still few. Handling is predictable, and boring, massive understeer that is only corrected by lifting the throttle, but I might be the only owner of one of these that drives at those limits anyway. In the snow this car runs circles around anything I've driven, ever. Well there was that snow mobile.... 
   Weak points, brakes could be better, CV joints retire after @70,000 there are four at roughly $150 a piece including new boots and labor. The exhaust is wildly expensive to replace, three pieces at @ $300 each, I've only replaced the center section so far. The trim pieces attached to the rain gutters come loose. Oh one other thing, the drivers seat is a thing of beauty, I have back trouble and can still sit in it for 12 hour jaunts.
   These would make an excellent used car buy, they seem to sell below wholesale book, and I have every intention of running mine for at least another 100,000 miles barring unseen calamity. Stay well away if your ego might be affected by a car this ugly though.
