            The Olympus D-460 Zoom digital camera is a great buy.  I researched several cameras when I finally decided to purchase this one about 2 years ago.  I have not been disappointed in the quality and easy-of-use.

<b>The Good:</b>
- LCD viewfinder (1.8" color) is a great alternative to the traditional viewfinder.  Traditional viewfinder is still present, so don't worry!
- Picture Quality.  Takes great pictures.  Looks great on the computer and prints very nice 4x6 pictures on photo paper.  Great for normal use situations.
- Zoom feature.  3x optical zoom and 2x digital.  Optical zoom is a better feature over the digital zoom since it does not decrease the image size or resolution like the digital zoom.
- Camera software.  Software is incredibly easy to use.  Great cropping feature to resize photos to specific sizes for internet use.  Can be used to resize and manipulate pictures and images not taken with the camera.
- Built-in flash.  Flips up when you need it, stays down and out of the way when not in use.
- 8 MB SmartMedia card.  Included with camera.  Holds 36 images at default resolution, which is quite large.  Holds many more pictures if taking smaller, web-friendly sized pictures.

<b>The Bad:</b>
- Battery usage.  Eats normal batteries, especially when using the LCD viewfinder.  I would recommend you buy the "nickel-metal hydride" rechargable batteries from RadioShack.  They last a long time in the camera and can still be recharged!  Consult the user manual for battery specifications to make sure you pick the right kind.
- Large photos.  Since this is an older and more entry-level camera, its 1.3 megapixels is not the best for printing large 8x10 and larger photos.  They look a little "blocky" when viewed up close.  A 2.1 megapixel or greater might be better if you plan on printing large photos.

<b>The Ugly:</b>
NOTHING.  Great looking camera.  Great price.  Great quality photos.  You won't be disappointed with this one for general usage!
