            I bought a 1993 Pontiac sunbird and i really like this car.  i have had this car ever since i was 16 years old.  it was my first car that i have ever had, it is also the only car i have ever owned.  i think that i might buy my self a new car with the money i get from epinions.com.  This car is a pretty nice car.  It has good speed and it does not get that bad of gas mileage.  but it is not the best gas mileage that you could get.  the brakes are still in good shape and so is the car.  it has a trunk that you can get into from the back seat.  that is a really nice feature.  my friends like that a lot too.   <br><br>
