            We Bought our Durango 1 year ago, after doing exhaustive research on many different SUV's. I was attracted to the Durango's styling, but wanted a vehicle that I felt safe with my wife and 2 children driving around town in, offered good handling, and was comfortable to drive. We got all we wanted and more with this vehicle! The 5.9L V-8 engine is extremely powerful, and gets relatively good mpg (16 mpg avg). Floor it at the light, and the tires squeal! The turning ratio of the Durango is amazing! I've driven all types of SUV's, and can not believe how good this truck corners. It's almost as good as my Jeep Wrangler I traded in for the Durango. I recently rented a Chevy Blazer, and felt like i was driving my Freightliner semi truck when it came to tight spots.
The interior is extremely comfortable, and the trip computer (optional) is a handy little toy. We also got the optional 3rd seat in the rear, which makes taking the kids and their friends around a breeze, while offering a tremendous amount of interior cargo room when folded down.
I can not recommend this vehicle enough. I have never owned a vehicle I have been this happy with. Everything from the back hatch door which opens easily and out of your way, to the A/C controls for the rear seat passengers was very well thought out. Buy it-you'll love it!<br><br>
