            When we went shopping for a new car, my priority was a fun, comfortable car for my wife and daughter.  My wife's priority was &quot;Something bigger than a shoe-box!&quot;.  Many of the cars we looked at meet my criteria, but not hers.

Then she spotted the Monte Carlo.

She was convinced after the first test drive.  The car felt larger than most other coupes we looked at, but was nimble and easy to drive.  We compromised on the LS, which came with a 3.1 liter V6, and sports suspension.  The option package included all the basics, and with the LS version you got the 16-inch alloy wheels which make the car.  

We have had the car for 3 1/2 years, have put 85,000 miles on it.  It is roomy inside, plenty of space for the three of us, and has an enormous trunk.  The seats are comfortable, and with dual-climate control, my wife and I are not bickering on the temperature.  

This car has made two trips to Florida, and each trip was easy to complete.  The MPG on these trips topped 32MPG, but on average we got about 22-26MPG during normal driving. 

Driving is always fun.  Cornering is nimble, and straight-line acceleration is above average for this size/price car. The performance is has maintained it's high level through all of these miles.  As an indication of how the car feels on the road, my anti-domestic, BMW-driving brother-in-law even enjoys taking it for a ride.

The other major factor that this car has got going for it is the safety features.  With dual air-bags, and side impact protection via steel-reinforced bars, it is a very durable car.  Unfortunately, we have tested these features.  In two accidents, both pretty major, the car protected my wife and daughter extremely well.  The last one, just three weeks ago, happened when a car side-swipped my wife after crossing the double-yellow.  While damage was high, the side-impact bars saved my daughter, who was sitting in the back on that side.  Both the police and insurance adjuster stated that without that feature, serious injury would have happened.  

Overall, the car has been great.  I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a sporty, comfortable car that can still take the family on long-distance trips.  The only knock is the longer than normal time it takes to heat up in cold weather.
