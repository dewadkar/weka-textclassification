            Want a fast reliable, comfortable, smooth riding four door sedan?  Then
the 2000 Toyota Camry fits the ticket. I purchased mine on 12/99 and
other than the usual oil changes this car runs like a champ.  

Features:

1. Purchased with V-6 engine automatic. (Super Fast pickup)
2. Big trunk area for groceries or a day of shopping at the mall.
3. Seats 4 adults very comfortably unless your a basketball pro.
4. Handles like a sports car on the turns, and great on slippery
roads.
5. Easy to do your own oil changes (V-6) everything is easily
accessible.
6. I got the 4 speaker stereo cassette player (well worth it).
7. Even with the  V-6 it has great fuel economy.  (20-25 mpg)
Mostly stop and go.
8. LE package is great, power windows, special lighting, better
interior package with console shifter.

There is one after market item that was a must for me. I purchased
a set of tinted window drip guards for all the windows.  When I
first got the camry it rained 2 days later. When I let the window
down to get some fresh air I got wet from the rain rolling off the 
roof of the vehicle. Since installing the drip guards, the window 
can be open 2 inches in a pouring rain and the driver or passenger do
not get wet. You can get them to match the color of the car, or just
plain black tint. A great add on for a Sporty Sedan. If your looking 
for a car, &quot;TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT A TOYOTA CAMRY&quot;.<br><br>
