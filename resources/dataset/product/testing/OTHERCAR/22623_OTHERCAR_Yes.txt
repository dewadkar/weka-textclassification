                <b>Hybrid technology</b> is not new by any means, I believe Detroit even had such cars in the 50s that had never made it into production. If this is true, I'm almost 100% positive they would have only dreamed of driving as well as the new Civic Hybrid does. When I first get into any new production car I always seem to look for the negative features first; being a total pessimist only aggravates the situation. Surprisingly, even though the 2003 Civic Hybrid has its faults, it offers so many positive attributes even Shania Twain would be baffled.  

<b>For the 2003 model year the all new Honda Civic Hybrid</b> comes in 1 trim line; titled very generically the <b>Honda Civic Hybrid</b>, and only one body style; a 4-door sedan. This Honda Civic Hybrid comes with a conventional 1.3 liter SOHC 4-cylinder engine coupled with a 13 HP powered electric motor. Together this engine/electric motor combo produces 93 horsepower at 5,700 RPM, and 116 lb-ft of torque at 'near idle' 1,500 RPM. Transmissions include a 5-speed manual, and a very smooth CVT automatic ( a $1,000 option on my tester). 


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 


Before I get into performance, I would like to note that when this tiny engine/electric motor combo is started up you can not hear no sound whatsoever from the crank, as you do with a conventional engine's starter. I noticed approx a 1/10th of a second lag between the time you turn the key and the time the engine actually starts up. I don't know if this was an anomaly, but the tachometer read that the engine was idling at almost 2,000 RPM for a 'very long' 5 minutes before the engine settled down to a normal 800-900 idle RPM. 
Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is not exactly good, but it comes so smooth that this is not a major gripe. Even though the Civic Hybrid is FWD (front wheel drive), I found there to be no torque steer whatsoever, even under full throttle. The CVT (Continuous Variable Transmission) automatic transmission allows for the smoothest shifting I have ever experienced with an economy car, or almost any car for that matter. This new designed automatic can also be found in the 2003 Nissan Murano allows for excellent shifting, and is much more refined than your conventional automatic. 

On take-off the engine is smooth all the way to near redline. With the CVT it's not exactly easy to get this car to redline, though most of the power is reached at a decent RPM so this is not such a big issue. Although 'you' might not notice the fact that this Civic is a hybrid powered vehicle when driving, I did notice the difference. The ever so subtle shuttle like sound that is emitted from the engine bay is nothing like the sound of the VVT engine in the EX Civic, nor does it perform the same way in terms of acceleration or behavior in general. 


<b>Handling</b> is good, I did get to drive this car on Highway 299 east towards Redding California and although it did well hugging the curves, I did feel a negative difference in handling than with the regular EX Civic. Despite the relatively wide tires (185 70R 14s) for a stock economy car, they seemed a little too tall for aggressive turning/driving in general. Perhaps 195/60R 14s would be more appropriate for this car. 

<b>Cruising</b> is a very strong attribute offered from the 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid. Bumps, rattles, engine and wind noise are next to none. Like the regular Civic EX, this car offers a much more expensive feeling ride quality, even with its less sophisticated suspension than most expensive cars. 

Hills are taken 'so so.' You can't feel the transmission down-shift like  you would a conventional tranny, but down-shifting can be noted by the RPM of the engine as it skyrockets to near redline when driving up 10% grades at 65 MPH. Fuel economy in this type of hilly terrain is excellent (at least according to the digital gauge). Even with steep hill climbing, the digital fuel economy gauge claims you are receiving 30+ MPG. 

<b>Braking</b> in the 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid is very good. Despite having an undesirable front disc and rear drum set-up, the four-wheel ABS added to this brake system really helps this small car come to a stop without any fuss whatsoever. 

<b>Fuel economy</b> is no surprise, an EPA of around 52 in town/ 48 on the freeway should be expected, however I estimate that these numbers will increase as the engine wears in, and with conservative driving. 
<b>www.fueleconomy.gov</b> can give you more detailed info. 

<b>NOTE:</b> Certain emissions for this car are about the same as the 'non hybrid' Toyota Echo.


<i>Interior/Accommodation:</i>

The <b>interior</b> of my Honda Civic Hybrid tester was a little on the 'ugly tan/orange' color side, but the dash offered a good use of titanium accents, instead of an 'overuse' which can be found in many luxury/near luxury car's interiors. It seems as though all 2003 modeled cars are going with titanium/chrome dash look. Instead of adding class, the overuse of this simulated metal, such as in the Lincoln Navigator, makes the interior look tacky and very 1980s; in a bad way. Remember what our 1980's stereo's looked like? Kinda like that. The instrument cluster offers very easy-to read blue gauges, and offers a mix of analog/digital displays of fuel economy, MPH, engine temp gauge, a trip computer, etc, etc. The drivers position of the 2003 Civic Hybrid is almost perfect, just like the 2002 EX trim lines. Ergonomics are excellent, and a generous amount of standard amenities are provided. A CD/tape player with 6 speakers, 2 cup holders that hide away in the front of the gear shifter, AC, dual front air bags, and dual side impact air bags, 12 volt power out-let, and a firm leather wrapped steering wheel are to name a few. <b>Honda.com</b> or <b>Cars.com</b> can provide you with further info. The seats, as with almost all Honda's are very comfortable and supportive. Plenty of leg room up front, and most adults should find plenty of space in the rear. The trunk however holds the batteries, so there is somewhat limited space there. This set-up also disables the back seats from folding down.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>


The <b>exterior</b> of the 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid looks almost exactly like the regular 2002 Honda Civics. If it wasn't for the "Hybrid" logo on the rear and the cheap/hubcap looking alloy rims, I would never know the difference from the regular EX. In-fact the 2003 Honda Civic SI looks more like the stereotypical hybrid vehicle than the actual Civic Hybrid. The front fascia of this car is relatively sedate, but large see-through headlamps add some character. This is the first hybrid car on the market that does not boast any sort of weird "look at me" styling cues. This is simply a functional design that will get lost in traffic with the rest of the Honda Civic owning masses.. Good thing? Depends on who you are and what you want from your car. 

<i>Price Reliability, and Warranty.</i>


 Base Price starts at around $19,900, however with the CVT automatic the price rises to near $21,000 as was my tester. This car is far to new to comment on reliability, however Honda offers a scant 3 year 36,000 bumper-bumper warranty, and a 8 year, 80,000 mile warranty on the batteries.

<i>Final Notes:</i>

This is an excellent car. Why only 3 stars then? Well, the price is very high for an economy car, only receives about 5-10 MPG better than the regular Civic trim levels, and has a selfish warranty. Overall, however, this car offers a good deal of innovation, value, and practicality. I would not mind owning this vehicle, in-fact when the prices go down in a few years I certainly will consider buying this car on the used market.
