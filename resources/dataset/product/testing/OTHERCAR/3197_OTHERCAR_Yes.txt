            The DSC-S85 is actually my second digital camera; my old Olympus D460 was lost when a piece of luggage went missing recently (note: don't pack photographic equipment in your luggage - it's not covered by the airlines).  This time around, I wanted a unit which had more flexibility, but retained the ability to point and shoot when desired.  A quality lens, a USB interface and the ability to print quality 8x10s were also important.

After poring over numerous professional and end-user reviews (if you haven't visited the site, www.dpreview.com it's highly recommended), I had narrowed my choice down to three cameras: the Sony DSC-S75, the Sony DSC-85 and the Canon Powershot G2.  

Having made the plunge with the DSC-S85, I can tell you with certainty that I have absolutely NO buyer's remorse.

This unit's strengths are it's flexibility, battery life and its 4-megapixel resolution.  

Still photography can be done using fully automatic, shutter priority, aperture priority or full manual modes, and with the ability to preview the results of each change in the viewfinder prior to taking the shot, encouraging experimentation that would be prohibitively expensive with a conventional camera.  While some of the available exposure modes, such as negative, seem like marketing gimmicks, being able to shoot photos in black and white and sepia modes does give additional creative flexibility. 

Once a photo is taken, you can zoom and pan shots in review mode, which gives you a chance to preview and even crop photos stored in memory.

Speaking of the zoom and pan function, while I haven't had the need to do an extremely large large print yet, the detail shown by the zoom and pan function gives me full confidence that this will not be a problem when the need arises.  Unfortunately, I can't attach images to this review, so you'll have to check out the sample images posted on www.dpreview.com.  

I LOVE the idea of using a camcorder battery in a digital camera - in this application, it charges quickly and goes over three hours on a single charge.  It's a nice compromise between high-capacity, custom batteries and using something more standardized.  The included AC adapter charges the battery quickly, though the cover for the A/C input on the camera is a chunky rubber plug which seems destined to get separated from the camera body over time. 

The movie mode is easy to use, and the images were of acceptable quality, but the images are jagged, kind of like an old 8mm movie.  Since I wasn't in the market for a camcorder, this wasn't an issue.

Things to get familiar with: the occasional white balance problem cited by other reviewers is something to be aware of, but the one-push manual white balance is a reasonable work-around when this is an issue.  Other reviewers have noted that the auto-exposure mode's slowest shutter speed is 1/30 second (an obvious concession to point-and-shoot crowd, so they don't blur normal shots).  My advice?  If you're going to spend this much money on a camera, take a weekend and do LOTS of practice photos, until you develop a comfort level with how the camera is going to behave under various conditions.  For instance, one thing I found after experimenting is that you don't use flash in low level lighting situations nearly as often as you might with a point-and-shoot unit.

Gripes?  A camera that lists for $800 should include at least 64MB of memory and a carrying case.  These items would typically add $100 to the purchase price at the camera shop, and I'm guessing that's why they're not included.  I'd suggest shopping for the camera, case and memory separately. 

Still, overall, I'm very happy with this camera, and I'm sure you would be too, provided it fits your budget and needs.  I give it my highest recommendation.
