             This little guy has done everything and more.  With my mom doing construction, she borrows it all the time for hauling, and it has never failed.  Sure, I've done the regular check-ups and a few things have had to be fixed, but its done an overall great job.  
 I now am approaching 115,000 miles, and it is still running at almost peak efficiency.  It gets pretty good gas mileage, and the services I've had done are reasonable.  Maybe its my mechanic, but I think its the fact that this little guy can do the job. 
 I think Isuzu as highly underated compared to the big names like Toyota and Mazda.  Being an Imported truck, it isnt going to be as powerful and big as the Dodges, Fords, and Chevies, but if you're looking for a reliable little truck, this is the one.

I'm expecting this beatter to go into 200,000 miles, and then I might get another one.  Probably not, cause Im going to look for a commuter car.  Well, when I need something like this, I'm going to look in Isuzu's direction.

Thank You for Your Time.<br><br>
