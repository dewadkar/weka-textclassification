            My last Mercedes,a 1989 560SEC, had a sticker price of $86,000, yet years later this 2002's sticker was only $94,000.  The improvements and refinements are dramatic! I drove a 2003 BMW 745Li for a weekend before going with the Mercedes, and I think I have a good sense of the difference.  While the BMW handles like a dream and dimensionally is the same size, the Mercedes seems more open and spacious while offering similar performance.  Mercedes seems to take an approach of making controls seem invisable because of their integration, the BMW required more hands on selection.

The ride and handling of this car are wonderful.  Three suspension settings accommodate everything from mountain twists and turns to the interstate.  While I would not have shelled out the additional $2500 plus for the Distronic Cruise Control, it was on the car.  But what a surprise!  Its radar lets you set a minimum distance from the car ahead while on "cruise".  I never realized how much attention was required using a cruise control without it, watching out for cars being overtaken too quickly. With Distronic, that concern is a thing of the past.  As a result, it is easy to become part of the traffic flow while maximizing speed.

The engine is flawless, and given the fact that it now appears across the E Class and G Class lines as well it seems to be a workhorse for Mercedes.  My car came with the Keyless Go feature, that lets you unlock and start the car without a key, but with a creditcard sized device in you pocket.  Really a convenience!  The transmission has the ability to adapt to the driver's habits, and we'll see over time what this means.  I very much appreciate the simple shift pattern and side to side motion for upshifts and downshifts, something missing on the US BMW's until a future "sport" package becomes available (the current BMW only shifts down with steering wheel buttons, and it takes two different buttons to downshift one gear).

Brakes on the car are cross-drilled Brembo's, quite a racing car feature on a sedan of any type.  They haul it down in a hurry.

While the seats in the BMW offered more adjustment, I prefer the Mercedes because they are larger.  The seats in either car are light years ahead of competition such as Lexus.  Their ability to support the thigh through a cushion that moves fore and aft independent of the seat is wonderful.  Mercedes seems to do it better by moving the entire seat cushion, while BMW uses a separate support that leaves a gap.  The back seat has more legroom than my den - unbelievable comfort.  Again, while the 745Li has lots of leg room too, the feeling of the BMW is more confined.  Trunk room is more than adequate and easily accessible.  Nice of Mercedes to relocate the trunk release to the driver's armrest area instead of in the glovebox as on so many cars.

I strongly preferred the body styling of the Mercedes over the BMW, but I am sure it is a matter of personal taste.  The Mercedes has much better sight lines out of the car; in the BMW one must depend on the radar parking feature to avoid hitting something when backing up.  Fit and finish seem well up to Mercedes standards.  While some decry a lessening in quality of materials, I find nothing that does not live up to what I found in the interior of my 1989 560 SEC or my father in law's 1998 S500.  Paint (brilliant silver) is flawless.

Some comment that the COMMAND system that offers controls for navigation, radio, CD, tape, and telephone is hard to work, but I have not been troubled by it.  And virtually all functions are repeated in steering wheel and keypad controls and a second display inside the speedometer, as well as through voice recognition.  Through 2002 there is no in dash CD slot (changer in the trunk), I understand that for 2003 the Nav CD slot now doubles as a single disk CD changer.  My only complaint about the car is lack of an indash changer such as that offered by Lexus.
