            I have some doubts as to anybody actually being in the market for a 1975 Cadillac Chateau Coupe DeVille but once-upon-a-time I had one so I'm going to write this one just for fun. Who knows? Maybe there is somebody out there looking for one of these thirsty old critters.

Why do they call it a &quot;chateau&quot; Coupe DeVille? Well... maybe because it's as big as a house? It did have all the Cadillac trademarks. The little ducks in the logo, the traditional tail lights, the little blinkers on the fenders that tell you your turning signal is on. It even had a little box on the interior above the rear-window that blinked when your signals or lights were on. Also on the interior was a clock that actually worked. When stored long-term it had to be disconnected or it would drain the battery.

The car that was in my possession was a beautiful beast of a machine with gleaming white paint with a black vinyl top. It was, of course, a two-door post car with all the goodies. Power trunk, locks, seats, antenna, &amp; windows, A/C, rear window defrost, cornering lights, remote trunk release, seats that hold you like a lover, leather here and there and best of all, a 500 cubic inch engine that just didn't want to quit.

The trunk was an interesting novelty. You click it down gently and then then a little motor pulls the deck lid down tight with a little mechanical sound. Everything about this car was luxurious, made to please.

The car drove like a dream with one finger on the wheel. It would glide down the interstate at 85 all day long and not give a lick of trouble.

Although, all this cruising cost you some pretty heavy change. On a good day she would get 12 miles to the gallon. Slow off the line, the car's top-end speed seemed infinate and it kept chugging along, faster and faster, always willing to give you a little more.

There are a couple things you have to watch out for on these older Cadillac cars. Once they start to rust, well... that's just about the end of the story. If you keep them out of the snow you'll do ok. Once they start it's like a cancer. It just spreads and spreads until it infects every little part of the car. Another cold-climate problem is the dash will get very brittle. Once the seat was all the way ahead and I jumped in the passenger side and my knee hit the edge of the dash and it made a large spider-web like crack along the edge of the dash. I was not pleased with myself.

On the plus side is the fact that these automobiles are built like tanks. Anything short of a dump-truck is going to bounce off these thing like a child's toy.

Parts for this vehicle are plentiful and the 472 and 500 CID engines are gaining support in the performance industry. 

And last but not least.... they come with a built in 8-track!<br><br>
