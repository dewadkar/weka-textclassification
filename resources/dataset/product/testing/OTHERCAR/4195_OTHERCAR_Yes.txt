            For the last five years my family (2 adults and 3 children )has been crammed into a small Hyundai Elantra. What a nightmare... buying the Caravan was the best decision we made all of last year.  Not only is the car roomy but for the parents it gives you a bit more privacy.

Maintenance wise, we have yet to have a single problem with it. Of course we were lucky. We found a 1996 with only 7500 miles on it! So although it was technically used, it feels brand new and performs as if it is.

We own a base model, but it still comes equipped with plenty of room, A/C, and ooodles of places to store things. (my car is half auto and half toy box!)

For anyone with a family of four plus, I highly recommend this vehicle to you.<br><br>
