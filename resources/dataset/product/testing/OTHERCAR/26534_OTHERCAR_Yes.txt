            I got my new navy blue S-10 Pickup when I graduated college three months ago. I have never owned a truck before, and I expected to feel as if I was driving a huge semi-truck, but to my surprise, my S-10 felt just as compact as a car! I was glad to see that it handles great too. I absolutely love the soft, cushioned seats that feel great on my back even when I'm on long trips. This vehicle is just great on gas too. I put in $20 and go nearly all week back &amp; forth to work without having to refill (and my work is 45 minutes away from home!.) I love that the lights automatically turn on when it gets dark too. I was very pleased with the huge bed, not having had a truck previously. I can now carry groceries and other large purchases. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't have as much pick-up as I might like. I think you should consider buying this vehicle if you want a tough, dependable truck, but if you're out for speed, you might want to pass this one by.<br><br>
