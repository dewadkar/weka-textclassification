            I've used many Sony Mavicas and owned one of the original Canon Powershots.  I'm an avid amateur photographer but no expert.  I also own Pentax MZ-5, Canon AE-1 Program and Pentax Spotmatic SLR equipment.

About a year ago, I lost my Canon Sureshot compact 35mm camera.  I wanted to replace it with compact snapshot-type camera and thought it might be time to go digital.

After looking at similar 3.3 megapixel offerings from Olympus, Ricoh and Nikon, I decided on the Canon mainly based on website reviews and experience with a friend's S10.

After 6 months of use, I have nothing but positive things to say about this little wonder.  Things I like:

1) It's small.  On vacation, I like to tuck a camera in a pocket or small camera bag.

2) It's rugged.  All metal construction gives you a nice hefty feel.

3) Picture quality is superb.  At max resolution, the picture quality is stunning.  I don't yet have a photo quality printer (next on the shopping list), so I can't tell you what they are like on paper, but I can tell you that on-screen quality is fantastic.

4) USB transfer and software is easy to use.  Getting the photos into my computer couldn't be much easier.  Plug in the USB cable and use the supplied Canon Powershot software to view and catalog the photos.  Easy.

5) Ease of use.  Turn the knob, point the camera and push the button.  

Some people might criticise the low zoom (only 2x) and the lack of TIFF mode, but it hasn't bothered me one bit.  If I'm in a high zoom situation, I bring one of my SLRs.

The only negative I have about this camera is lowlight, high speed performance.  During a ballet recital in a moderately lit dance hall, most of my photos came out blurred.  In outdoor bright sunshine situations, it was fine (eg. soccer game), but in indoors, it is not fast enough.

Overall, I highly recommend this camera for demanding consumers.<br><br>
