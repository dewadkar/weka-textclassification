            I took delivery on our Yukon XL last week.The ride and handling are ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD. I can't wait for morning to drive it. First class SUV. The wait was well worth it.
 For a full-size SUV it has surprising agility.Two features that I really like are the sunroof and the sound system with a subwoofer. Best in its class for comfort and convenience. Having side -impact air bags and the ON Star communications and assistance system sure gives my wife and I a good sense of safety and security. This is my first GM vehicle since 1986.
I did a lot of research before I made this decision. It sure paid off.
What more can I say. <br><br>
