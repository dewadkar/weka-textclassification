            my first new car purchase has been the 1999 daewoo lanos. i did not intend to buy the car when i went shopping, just wanted to see it. the car is very small outside: about the size of a geo metro. it is much larger inside however! my car has automatic transmission, a/c, am/fm/cass stereo, 3 door hatchback. the total price (sticker) was still less than $10,000. that includes a 3 year 36000 mile bumper to bumper warranty and all scheduled maintenance: parts and labor!!! everything but the tires is covered, even the windshield wiper blades. the car is surprisingly peppy. 1.4 litre, 120 hp, great acceleration, comfortable top end, easy to drive. NOTE i am 5'9&quot; and over 300 pounds and still have plenty of room. the cargo space is great also. the back seat is larger and more comfortable than others in this class. the only drawback i have found so far (6000 miles) is the fuel mpg's: less than 25 mpg combined. hopefully this will improve in time. also, the clearance is very slight and you have to be cautious going over railroad tracks. i am very happy with the car and it's value. i look forward to upgrading to the laganza when the lanos is paid off!!<br><br>
