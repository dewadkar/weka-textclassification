            We have a 1997 Cavalier and it has been nothing but garbage since we bought it.  We had a problem with our windshield wipers that took GM over 2 years to fix.  We also had faulty air bags that we were never even told about.  The airbags in our car could have been activated at any time, just by having the car running, and GM NEVER notified us of this.  
We have had to have the ignition switch replaced twice already because it was faulty.  Couldn't even get the ignition to move, so the car was stuck where it was parked!!!  
We haven't even had the car for 3 years yet (bought brand new) and already the front shocks are going bad and now the muffler is starting to go!
And GM does NOT own up to their extended warranty.  We had a GM dealer tear up the lighting in our car, and when we had it fixed, they refused to cover it under warranty, so WE had to pay for it.
There are a few good things about the Cavalier, like the coziness of it and the large trunk.  The stereo is also installed so that it can't be stolen without ripping out the whole dashboard.  The car rides nice, in general, but too much stuff has gone wrong for it not to even be 3 years old.    
One thing is for sure, we won't be buying any more Chevy cars!!!<br><br>
