            I purchased a 1995 Chevy Cavalier about a year ago and it was running fine, the second I hit the 70,000 mile mark things went bad.  I'm not saying the engine blew up or anything but small things have happened, like the collant is leaking, the ABS has needed serviced, it has over heated.  These may not seem like big things and really they aren't but when you have to take a car to a mechanic for all these little things it really adds up.  Other than that it has been good, the gas milage is good, it is good in the snow, and it has fairly good acceleration.<br><br>
