            After owning 3 Pontiac Grand Ams for 12 years, I purchased a Chevy Lumina LTZ... Beautiful Black exterior and truly luxurious to the touch, fine leather seats. The factory stereo even kicks bu_t.  The most impressive feature I have found ... a darn shame, but nevertheless, I was in an accident with it.  A fine young high school student, with much more important things on his mind, rammed the back end of the car while I was at a deadstop.  The police officer estimated his speed at 35-40 miles per hour.  (That's kind of what I would guess as I looked in my rearview mirror and saw him approaching.) The perp also shoved me into the car in front of me. I was amazed to find that the car had no major damage.  It certainly did not appear to have just been in an accident. Both license plates were twisted a bit and the trunk lid was mis-aligned, but it really looked pretty good.  (Our necks were a little different story, but no major damage there really)  It amazed me that this car was sturdy enough to withstand such a hard impact.  I'd recommend this to families for certain.  It's roomy and really nice inside and obviously a safer vehicle when getting in an accident...( at least from the rear.) <br><br>
