            After going through many trucks and SUV's I decided to buy a car.  So I went searching for something that looked good, had a smooth ride, and had a little bit of speed to it.  

Well what do you know I found just what I wanted in the 2000 Eclipse.  It's slender frame definitely makes it an eye catcher, not to mention the ladies love it.  The inside of the car will amaze you when you get in.  It feels like your getting ready to fly a plane.  All the controls are right in front of you and easily accessible.  The silver face guages are perfect for the instrument panel and the new vents look really good.  

The Eclipse provides a smooth ride considering it is low to the ground and it is after all a sports car.  I travel a lot and on the highways I can do anywhere form 60 to 135 mph and it feels like I'm floating on air.  Because of the seat design you cna make those quick turns and not slide around in your seat.  The only bad thing about the car is that it can be pretty noisy inside, especially if you have the rear seats folded down.  

Now to my favorite, the speed.  The GT comes out of the factory with 195 horsepower and that is plenty for this lightweight car.  It has the ability to accelarate past cars when needed to and or leave another car in it's dust if you get the urge to race it.  I have recently bought another car for traveling and turned my eclipse into a racing machine.  I installed a 75 shot of nitrous in it and it handles the power extremely well.  

The only problem I'va had is a cylinoid going out, which was still under warranty so it was no big deal.<br><br>
