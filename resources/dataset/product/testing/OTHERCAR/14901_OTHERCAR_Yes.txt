            Having used several other Digital Cameras supplied by the Company I worked for I wanted to own my own.  I set some goals for what I was looking for:

   1. Easily Portable and easy to use.
   2. Rechargeable battery.
   3. Down loadable to a laptop or home computer.
   4. 10X minimums zoom lens.
   5. Good quality pictures that could be printed by my home inkjet.
   6. Color Screen to review the picture - Similar to Video Camera.

This is what I found.
   1. The Mavica is portable but is larger than most Digital Cameras.
   2. The Mavica is provided with a rechargeable battery and world voltage
          use recharger. No more throwaway batteries that you cannot
          find. Approx. 150+ pictures per charge, less with flash.
   3. The Mavica is down loadable to a computer by using standard 3.5&quot;
          floppy disks. No memory cards to worry about or limited storage.
          Hi Quality shots give approx. 20 pictures per floppy. Floppies
          not formatted - no worry the Mavica can format the floppy also.
   4. The Mavica provides a 10X Zoom lens.
   5. The Mavica model that I have provides approx. 700K pictures that 
          print out very well.  Latter models have higher resolutions.
          Because Mavica can save the picture in Black/White, Sepia etc
          you have more print choices.
   6. The Mavica has a large 3&quot; X 3&quot; approx. rear color screen.  You can
          set options to have other screens as black/white, sepia, etc.
   7. Standard flash operated from the rechargeable battery.
   8. Can review, edit and remove pictures that I do not like from the
          rear controls and color screen.

This is what I use the Mavica for:
   1. Family gatherings
   2. Vacations
   3. Some business
