            This is a great camera it takes nice quality photos. It does have a zoom also. It does take a long time to download your photos. I have used mine so much. I used it when my twins were born this year and emailed the photos to every one in the family it was very useful because i still have not mailed out any regular photos to the family and they are 2 months old. It is very convenient and it is easy to use. The only downfall ther eis , is when you use the lcd panel to take your pictures it drains the battery really fast and if you use the batteries to download it to your computer only once your batteries are done. You will spend alot of money with this digital camera on batteries. Take my word for it i have bought soooo many. <br><br>
