            For the past 2 years, I've been using the Olympus D-320L with moderate success.  But it couldn't replace a 35mm for four major reasons:

 1. No Zoom - That big, blue sky was gorgeous--but what you wanted was a picture of your sweetheart.
 2. Low Resolution - Faces look blurred after cropping or zooming with your imaging software.
 3. Small Capacity - 8 MB is not enough space for your entire vacation.
 4. Too Slow - Great shot, but I missed an even better one while my camera was saving the image.

Now I shoot like a pro.  Olympus has hurdled each of those shortcomings with their new C-2500L.  See how it compares:
 
 1.) 3x Optical Zoom - Get professional results by zooming in on your subject to contrast them against an out-of-focus background and achieve maximum subject detail.  The Olympus B-28 Wide Angle Lens and 1.45x Telephoto Converter Lens can be added to further enhance your work.
 2.) 2.5 Mega pixel images - They're good enough to frame.  If you use an online printing service such as ofoto.com, you won't be able to tell 35mm prints from the digital.
 3.) 160 Megabytes of storage - The C-2500L comes with a 32MB SmartMedia card, but you can use a 64 MB SmartMedia card and a 96 MB CompactFlash card simultaneously.  That allows you to take over 250 high-quality (1280 x 1024) images.
 4.) 16MB of on-board cache allows you to take up to 5 photos as fast as you can press the shutter button.

Although the price is currently high, it will come down quickly with time.  Whatever you do, don't throw away $400 on a less-than desirable model.

My wife gave me the C-2500L as a Christmas gift.  Even though the images on our web site are all stored in low-resolution format, I think you'll notice the difference between the older photos and my more recent shots:
