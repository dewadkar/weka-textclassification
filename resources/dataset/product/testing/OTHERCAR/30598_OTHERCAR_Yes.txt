            I purchased a (used) 95 Kia in 1996 and have owned it for three years now.  I absolutely love this vehicle.  According to Consumer's Reports, it is not the highest rated SUV due to the fact that the spare tire could possibly go through the rear window in the event of a collision.

However, it is a fun vehicle to drive.  It handles well both on and off the road and fits into those tight parking spaces we're all familiar with.

We've had no serious problems or breakdowns during our three-year ownership.  We've made sure that we've done the usual regular maintenance, i.e., oil changes, tune-ups, and don't have a damn thing to complain about with this vehicle.

I love it!<br><br>
