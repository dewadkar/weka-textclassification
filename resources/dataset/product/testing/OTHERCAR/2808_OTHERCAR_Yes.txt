               This is my second digital camera, and boy was I blown away by the features on this one. I am absolutely in love with this camera.
   I paint and sell collectable miniatures on eBay and the last camera just wasn't cutting it. The ability to choose from two resolution settings over four compression modes is great. I normally have it set at the1280x960 HQ mode and it works great, especially with the the zoom. At this setting I can still take roughly 36 shots before downloading.
   Downloading is something else I (and my wife) love about this camera, is the fact that there are no more cords to clutter up the desk. Just pop it in to the Flashpath adapter and into the floppy drive. If there was anything that could better, it would be the Smartmedia reader. Its a mini disk drive made for the memory card. I don't have one yet(the next purchase) and I wish I did.
   As great as this camera is there are two issues that should be brought up. The access door for the video out(yes you can hook it up to your TV!!), AC adapter, and serial connection is very flimsy. So be careful! And as with all devices with an LCD it sucks batteries dry awfully fast.
   Over all, any possible drawbacks you could find in this camera are greatly out weighed by all the features and ease of use.
   Enjoy!!!!<br><br>
