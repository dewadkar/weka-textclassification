            Two years ago my grandma gave me a 1990 Sable Sedan with about 80,000 miles on it (thanks grandma :).  The car has a 3.0 liter, V-6 engine and very few options other than an automatic transmission.  The car spent the majority of its life in California, so there is no rust and only a little sun damage.

With only two minor repairs, this car has served me faithfully in my hour or so of driving a day.  There was a short in the glove box and a problem with the wipers, but both problems were quickly and inexpensively solved.  There has never been a problem of dependability and I would recommend this car to anyone.  <br><br>
