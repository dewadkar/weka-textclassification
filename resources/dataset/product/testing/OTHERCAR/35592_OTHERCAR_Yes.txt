            I've had the 2001 Tracker LT for a little more than a month now and I am very pleased with the vehicle.  Thus far, I have found no defects with the vehicle.

When I first saw the 2001 Tracker at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, its good looks and nice array of features captivated me.  When I finally got to drive one, the smooth ride, firm handling and modest noise level similarly impressed me.  I never considered any other Tracker model except the LT because I like the options standard with the LT package and I thought the running boards looked great on the vehicle.  I was pleasantly surprised by the cost of the vehicle which I felt gave me more for less as compared to the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CRV.

With regard to ride, the Tracker is built on a truck frame as opposed to a car frame.  This makes the vehicle feel solid and sure footed lending to a smoother ride even on rough surfaces.  The best way I can describe the way the vehicle handles is "tight".  Steering is precise and the vehicle handles bumps, curves, and quick maneuvers very nicely.  The ride is smooth, quiet and precise.  The V6 engine and 4 speed automatic combination provide smooth power and acceleration.  I did expect the vehicle to be a bit quicker given the V6, but power and acceleration is more than acceptable.

The "on the fly" 4WD feature works well.  You can quickly shift from 2WD high to 4WD high at speeds up to 60mph.  This comes in handy when road conditions change rapidly as they do here in Michigan.  I've driven the through snow, rain and gravel and loose surfaces in 4WD high then switched back to 2WD on tamer road surfaces in an instant. 
Fuel economy has been averaging about 19MPG in mixed city and highway driving.

Braking is sure and smooth but this vehicle definitely would benefit from ABS.  It is the one option that I wish my vehicle had and that I hope Chevrolet would include as standard on future models.  

The interior of the vehicle is well appointed and the standard cloth seats are attractive and comfortable.  They may seem a bit narrow at first, but are comfortable nonetheless.  What I have found with other vehicles, both large and small is that the seats sometimes are short offering limited thigh support.  The seats on the Tracker seem long enough to offer thigh support.  Headroom is great, as is visibility.  However, the view out the rear window is limited a bit but the rear headrests and the externally mounted spare tire.  I haven't found this to be a limiting factor thus far.  The AM-FM-CD sound system is excellent with sound quality approaching "premium sound".

In summary, the 2001 Tracker LT is a well made, well appointed mini-SUV that is fun to drive and that I would recommend to anyone considering a Toyota RAV4, Honda CRV or other vehicle in this group.
