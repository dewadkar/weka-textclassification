            I have the camera for 3 weeks and I am satisfied with the results. The price is good for a 3 megapixels camera and it was really simple to use (I learned to use it without the manual). Picture quality is good (similar to other 3 Mpixel camera), colors are saturated, maybe too much in the reds. The images are a bit overprocessed, not terrible but can be seen in the 8x10 pictures.

I did not acquired the docking station and will not do it, it was very simple to transfer the pictures with the included USB cable. A must is a 1850 to 2200 mAh rechargeable battery set with a fast charger (as with other digicams).

This camera was designed as a point-and-shot, so it have  few manual controls (the most useful control is that exposure can be varied by +/- 2 EV). The white balance is automatic only (no manual options), but the camera can handle different light sources with very good results.

The autofocus system is very good, specially considering that the camera has no focus-assist lamp. You can lock the focus and the exposure, partially pressing the "shutter" release.

You can not select shutter speed or lens aperture (as with other point-and-shot cameras), but you can use the scene modes to vary it (I use speed mode more than the standard auto mode, and turn off the flash except when I really need it).

The LCD is ok (average), considering the price, my only complain is that it was difficult to see in very dim light and is better to use the optical viewfinder in these cases.

The startup time is slow if you compare it with a film camera, but equivalent to other digicams in this range. The same issue applies to the "shutter" delay after button pressure. 

The camera was well constructed and I consider it beautiful designed. The size was small if not diminutive, almost the same as my Rollei 35 (the smallest 35mm camera in the 60's), I am using the Easyshare with a hand made Rollei 35 bag. You can find a more rugged or a smaller digicams but at higher price.
