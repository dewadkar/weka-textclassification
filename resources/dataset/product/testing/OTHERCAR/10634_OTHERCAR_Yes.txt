            Alright, the lease on our 2000 Toyota Sienna LE expired just recently, so this time we decided to BUY a 2003 Sienna, but we decided to go for the yuppi edition, the XLE.

The 250 horsepower V-6 engine is one of the best things about the new toyota. On this van we went all out, spending aobut 32,000 dollars...on a minivan, next time we'll just buy a beamer, yo.  This van is probably the BMW of the van world though, with it's multitude of amenities.
Features:
- Leather, heated seats, with a power driver side seat
- 1 row of captain's chairs, and 1 bench seat for 7 total passengers,GET the leather, it is so comfortable especially for the long drives
- Great JBL sound system, with a 6 CD changer and 10 speakers
- 2 way power moonroof, power locks and windows
- Skid control that has on/off capabilties
- Roof rack and GREAT trunk space when both seats are taken out
- Back row bench splits, and seats are availbale to tumble forward, so the removal is not necessary for more trunk space
- 2 sliding doors, with POWER, this car is for the laziest American soccer mom, buttons inside the car and on the key-remote allow for power side door opening and closing
-Alarm system and keyless entry
-Alloy wheels and fog lights--if you live in London

Disadvantages: 
- not many, but the backseats are a little difficult to remove, as they are heavy and the levers to remove them can stick, and it always takes 2 people to do it, yet the back seats can tumble forward
- Also the turning radius is not the best, sometimes parking the van is like parking a small school bus, so get ready for some 3 point turns, maybe you should take drivers ed again

Overall, this thing comes with everything, probably even with a cleaning service, i don't know, but if you are going for the family truckster's BMW, the Sienna XLE is the choice, with a great engine and feature line up, its well worth the 30+ grand to buy it
