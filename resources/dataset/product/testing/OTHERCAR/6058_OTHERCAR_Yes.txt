Let me say right off the bat that I gave this camera 4 stars because the video does have not sound -- how wack is THAT??

Except for this, it's a really great camera. The zoom is INCREDIBLE for a digital camera, along with the 3.2 mp, producing crisp, detailed images. I know everybody hates to read manuals, but honestly, if you just take the time to read this one (the cd version), you will be to correct all of the complaints I've read about with this camera. So let me just sum it up below:

Pros
1. Incredible zoom. And by reading the manual, I was able to prevent the blurriness that normally occurs without a tripod -- at least a great deal of it. 
2. XD card -- it's worth it having to start all over with new media. I've had my camera for one week, have taken over 200 pictures and 5 videos, and the batteries are still at full strength. That's because of the XD card. It also downloads to the computer super fast, and again, doesn't drain the batteries.
3. The scene modes -- read about them. They REALLY work.
4. The 2 modes for slow flash -- slow1 and slow2 -- they somehow prevent blurry pictures when zooming (I'm not sure how).
5. The mode scenes -- they do well with what they are supposed to do. Adjusting the flash helps, if you have any problems.
6. The ability to save 4 "my modes" custom settings.
7. The manual mode -- I haven't learned how to use it all yet, but I can tell this is where you can start to get perfect shots if you master this.
8. Shots in the dark -- I mean complete darkness -- UNBELIEVABLY good! Again, use the "night" mode and the slow flash.

Cons
1. The viewfinder -- it has an adjustment (diopter?), but it's still sometimes hard to see. However, just using the "automatic" mode or one the of scene modes will help compensate for this. 
2. No sound with the videos. Okay, I'm not trying to use it as a camcorder or anything, but it would be helpful to be able to make quick movies with sound to email to family members.
3. The XD card -- I know I also listed this as a positive, and even though it is, it still [is bad] that I have 4 cf memory cards just sitting around now!
4. This is an odd place to put this, but the Olympus C750-- wait for that model. It will have all the features of this one, PLUS a hot-shoe flash, PLUS 4 mp, PLUS sound with the movies. I really think I'm going to return this one and wait for the 750.

All that being said -- if you can't wait or can't spring for the extra bucks for the 750, you CAN'T GO WRONG with the 740!
