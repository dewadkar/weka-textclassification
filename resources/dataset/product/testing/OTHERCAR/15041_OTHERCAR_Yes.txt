            I had been looking for a fun and easy digital camera for sometime when I asked for this one for Christmas. I am quite happy with it. It is very easy to use, basically a *point and shoot*. Pics are clear enough for publishing on the Web. They do lack the finer resolution of a 35mm photo, but if you want to add fun, easy photos to your personal web site, this is the camera for you. I love that pics are stored on floppy disk, no hassle downloading them to your computer. Price is average for the advantages this camera offers. Another neat feature is that you can take *smaller* images suitable for e-mailing to friends, without crashing their resources. You take the pic, review the image and either accept what you see, or easily delete that image and begin again.
Comes with battery charger and the charge really does last 2 hrs or a bit more, depending on use. Give it a try, you won't be sorry.<br><br>
