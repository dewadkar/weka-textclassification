             In December of 1995 i bought my second car, a 1992 Nissan Maxima SE (automatic). I traded in old faithful, a 1986 maxima gle. I wanted something newer, faster and more "ME".
The 1992 Maxima SE was All That And then Some. I Bought initially automatic because i didnt know how to drive a 5spd at the time. I did want a racer though...and i began to modify it for speed. This was the best and worse thing i ever did with this car....and is probably why i dont own it today. I'll start with why it was the Best thing. This Car takes to Modifications with the likes of BMW m3's. The Smallest things add huger gains. I added a k&n Pop Charger, full exhaust system, custom downpipe, computer chip, and jim wolf technology computer controlled nitrous system. The Car hauled glutious maximus and i eventually got it into the 13's in the 1320 (1/4 mile). i was an avid late night street racer at the time and was deemed the Million shot maxima owner. Nobody would race me as i was destroying corvettes,mustangs and just about anything i raced...as there was no replacement for NITROUS OXIDE in an already light, peppy import sedan. 

The Problems started and ended with the transmission. The automatic transmission wasnt designed to be drag raced. it was designed to go from day care, to the grocery store, work etc. The transmission just couldnt hold the 100+hp i added. and i went through 3 rebuilds before i finally got it fully built for a hefty $2,800 bucks! well that was the key..everything was great it shifted like a mule kick and barked the tires in 2nd and 3rd gear shifts. This was my holy grail....my last hope...well guess what. 
After about a yr. it was starting to show it didnt like the torture i was putting it through either. i got scared and didnt want to put another transmission in...so i put it as much to stock as i could. And traded it in for a 1999 sentra SE-Limited..Basically a Mini Maxima..but this time with a 5spd transmission..i do Miss my maxima and it was a great car. But life goes on. Hey i even have another one now
it's a 98 not quite as refined as the 92 was. but stock to stock the 98 feals even stronger than my 92 did. so i still am a maxima owner. But for my racing needs. I beat up on my 2.0 litre sentra...thats just as fast believe it or not. And can take the pain in the transmission area. And i can Cruise around like a cool guy on the weekends in my Maxima =) you can see both my cars at http://www.geocities.com/nissan99sel

go buy a Nissan today, they are awesome cars!
