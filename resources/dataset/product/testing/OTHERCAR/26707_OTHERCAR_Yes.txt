            I have never been a material girl and objects dont impress me, but keep your hands off my Olympus!! I earn money for my wildlife rehab center using digital photography of the animals to make T-shirts, and this camera was exactly what I needed! When a raccoon does a head stand or a deer walks on her hind legs, I need to be ready in seconds. I can do that with this camera. The photos are incredible and many people think I am a professional because of my clearly defined photos and portrait quality prints. A friend of mine was so impressed, she bought one for herself. The options are great and they are all something I will use. The camera itself feels good in your hand and is so easy to operate. It also seems sturdy. So far I have dropped it more than once and had a deer run off with it another time. Its in one piece and works like new. I will most definately have another Olympus!<br><br>
