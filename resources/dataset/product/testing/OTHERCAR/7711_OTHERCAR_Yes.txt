            The chevy Tahoe is a good buy for its money.  The interior is of upmost comfort providing leather bucket seats and dash.  The standard sound system speakers, with optional cd player, provide excellent sound quality at all volume levels.  

The Chevy Tahoe provides a very comfortable ride both on and off the road.  The only problem with the car's ride is that being so large, when the car is in two wheel drive it leans dramatically on medium to higher speed turns.  When the car is in four wheel drive it handles with very little leaning.

Off road, the Chevy Tahoe handles very well.  This car has very little problems in mud and no problems at all on trails and in the snow.  If you decide to go with the Z71 package to offroad you might want to have the skid plates bent forward a little bit because if you high-center and have to drag the bottom of the car for a bit the skid plates tend to grab into the ground and dig up dirt instead of deflecting the ground like they are designed to do.

Overall, I would recommend this vehicle to anyone seeking a luxurious suv that easily handle both on and off road conditions.  It provides plenty of room for a large crowd.

I rate this vehicle an 8 out of 10 <br><br>
