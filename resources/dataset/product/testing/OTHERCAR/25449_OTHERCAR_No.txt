            I bought my '98 SL2 new and owned it for three years before trading it in on a full-size Chevy pickup. The Saturn was my first new car, and I did a lot of research, narrowing my choices to either the SL2 or a Pontiac Sunfire coupe.
While I probably could have bought the Sunfire for less than the $14K I paid for the Saturn, I chose the Saturn because it was cheaper to insure, got great gas mileage (even for an automatic) and had dent-resistant body panels.
The sales experience was okay, but since I'd never bought another car from another dealer, I had nothing to compare it to.
Anyway, while the car was reliable, I was disappointed at the number of problems I had with it in the first 18 months or so of ownership. These problems included weatherstripping that fell out, noisy window cranks (made a clunking sound), faulty interior light and sagging seat covers. While these problems were minor and covered under warranty, the incovenience of several trips to the dealer wore thin quickly. After all, one of the appeals of a new car is that all you should have to do is change the oil every 3,000 miles. I don't think that's too much to ask.
The car is also plagued with squeaks and rattles (one was caused by a loose headlight assembly). Plus, the paint is very susceptible to scratches. I had non-metallic black paint, and every time I washed it, there were scratches (and I used a clean wash mitt).
I was mostly satisfied with the quality of the dealer service department (although I spent more time there then I'd have liked). One complaint I have is the outrageous price of dealer parts, like $16 for a set of 4 spark plugs, which I can buy for $4 at an auto parts store. The dealer charges about $160 to replace front brake pads, when most garages will do the job for less than $100. If you do your own maintenance, the oil filter is not easy to reach.
As for the car itself, the SL2's larger engine was very peppy, even with an automatic. I had no trouble merging with highway traffic from an on-ramp. The car also handled curves and corners very aggressively, with no swaying or leaning. Even in emergency maneuvers (such as avoiding debris in the road), the car was very stable and responsive. Of course, great handling means less ride comfort, and the car felt every little bump in the road with its stiff suspension. Plus, the original Firestone (read: Fire Rock) tires didn't help. They were so hard that I still had two of the original tires with legal tread after about 80,000 miles.
Although the SL2 was a fun car to drive, all while getting good gas mileage and being cheap to insure, there were sore spots. Foremost, the bucket seats were uncomfortable after driving more than 15 minutes (and I'm not particularly tall or heavy). The bucket is too short and deep for any kind of comfort. In fact, I had to resort to putting a folded-up towel just to make the seat bearable on my hour-long commute. The car also had a terrible turning radius. My truck can turn a much tighter circle than this compact car. Just another example of poor design of Saturns.
After I recently got a job in construction, I needed a truck because I couldn't fit all my tools in the Saturn's trunk, plus I wanted to be able to haul lumber and building materials. Although the guy who sold me the Saturn said they had high resale value, I found that was not the case. Several used car dealers said my Saturn was worth only $4,000 to $5,000 in trade, although it was only three years old and well-maintained in and out. But the kicker was that the dealer who sold me my Saturn said it only had a trade-in value of $3,000!!! Granted, it did have high mileage, but $3,000 was an insult.
Luckily, I got a great trade-in offer from the dealer who sold me my Chevy truck. I don't miss my Saturn one bit.
