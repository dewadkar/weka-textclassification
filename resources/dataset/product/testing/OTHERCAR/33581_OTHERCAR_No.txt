            Let me start by saying my last car was a honda prelude. It was at 100000 miles and was a good car. Now my 97 BMW 5 series is not doing so well. Let me begin by listing the repairs since owning it:
Alarm system too sensitive, picked up motion of dust
Trunk Latch remote - replaced
Oil seal on pan replaced
All the light bulbs have now been replaced
Air conditioner compressor replaced
rear window regulators replaced, both sides
Radiator overflow tank, cracked, overheated car, replaced
I am now happy when I get to work and home without calling the mechanic. I stopped using bmw service as it was a 6 week wait for anything, also service implies that they might care if I was happy. The car when taken for warranty work was dirtier than when I brought it too them. The last time it came back without a headlight working. The honda was one light in 6 years of driving it. The dealer not only didn't charge me for it , but washed the car for free. Also they always had a loaner, never at BMW. It is the last one I will ever own.  To be honest though I was told these cars were a maintence nightmare, but I refused to believe it, I believe now!!! If it keeps working for another month I'll have to inspect it and try to get through the winter. Over all, do yourself a favor if you want this car, look at it and buy a lexus or even a lincoln ls the quality will be better.
