            My husband and I bought our Pontiac Montana in August of 1999.  We are extremely happy with our purchase.  We bought our van fully loaded and even got a tv installed in it.  This van is PERFECT for travelling.  In a little over a year we have less than 30,000 miles and we have travelled as far away as Baltimore, Md. 

We made our purchase after looking at several different mini-vans.  The only draw-back to our vehicle is the way that the van handles abrupt stops.  The braking is a little slow.  This is a minor inconvenience compared to the other great features the van has.

The van has dual control for temperature and for music.  It is really good when the children can listen to music in the back and we can listen to different music in the front.  The ride is very smooth and the gas mileage is excellent!  I only have to fill up the vehicle 1 time every week and a half. 

When I am driving the Montana, I feel like I am driving in luxury.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who travels a lot.  The seating is very comfortable.  We have captain's seats throughout the van.  The exterior style of the van is so nice that you would not even think that it was a mini-van.  It has the same type of style as a sports-utility.  My husband LOVES to drive in it!  I am extremely satisfied with it.<br><br>
