            My husband and I always shopped around for cars never a  suv, because I never saw one that really got my attention.Well, first of all my mother-in-law has a 95 Jeep Grand Cherokee.We had a Mazda 626, but I have two boys with long legs not to mention my brothers and father are all over 6'2.Were in the military so we travel and needed something that was going to have room and be comfortable.While back home (Lincolnton NC)one morning my husband got up before me and when he returned he was driving a 97 Grand Cherokee.I went out to look at the inside , because I had seen plenty on the road ,but like I said it didn't catch my attention.After driving it for myself I fell in love with it.It had lots of room and a nice size trunk.It was very affordable, and it came with everything I wanted in it, so I didn't have to add anything.It drives really well in any kind of weather.Not only do we own a jeep now ,but my father, sis-in-law,and mom-in-law.<br><br>
