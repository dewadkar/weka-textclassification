            Bought mine new in June, 2000.  Heavily discounted and huge rebates from GM made it a good buy; comparing it to a Ford Ranger with its' smaller engine and seats that look as if they came out of a city bus helped make my final decision.

I bought an extended cab 2WD model with alloy wheels, heavy duty suspension system, power steering, brakes, windows and locks, tilt wheel, cruise, CD, air, full gauges with tach, leather-wrapped steering wheel, driving lights, chrome appearance group, third door and automatic. 

Please keep in mind that I use mine for a truck; not a car with a big trunk, not a 4WD play-in-the-mud toy; not for a lowered, chopped or modified street racer, but a TRUCK.      

Engine:  The 4.3L V-6 gets better with age.  I went to synthetic oil at 5K miles, and now have about 30K miles.  Loads of power, decent mileage (20-22 MPG)and very quiet.  

Transmission:  The four-speed automatic shifts perfectly whether hot or cold, loaded or empty.  

Brakes:  Four-wheel ABS works flawlessly.  I've had it engage a few times on slick streets or in loose gravel.  

Steering: The steering has a good balance of feel and power assist. If you know the steering system on any truck for the last twenty years, you'll be familiar with this one.  Other than faster steering (which may NOT be a good idea in a light truck) I don't know what advantage there would be to having rack and pinion steering.  By the way, all of the major components have grease fittings.  Sealed-for-life bearings and steering components may be OK for a car, but I truly believe trucks need to have steering components fitted with grease fittings in order to extend their life, especially if you drive in dusty or rural conditions.  

Ride:  Mine has the heavy (4600 GVW) suspension.  It rides VERY firm when empty, and very smooth with a full load.  If you need the extra capacity, the heavy-duty suspension is a good trade-off.  If you will almost never have the truck loaded, consider the lighter suspension system.  I've actually had clerks at Home Depot tell me they could get more bags of concrete in my S-10 than in a base Ford F-150 without the back end sagging.  

Tires:  Uniroyal Tiger Paws, sometimes known by other S-10 and Sonoma owners as Useless Royals.  They are a compromise tire at best, but they are proving to be trouble-free and will probably last to 50-60K miles.  No problems such as the infamous splitting treads the Firestones are known for.  Here's a hint:  when they start to squeal, it's time to rotate them.  

Electrical:  No major problems.  Always starts, alternator seems to have no problem keeping up with all of the accessories.  The battery failed about a year ago and was replaced under warranty, but I have no idea if this is a common occurance or if I just got a bad battery.  Good headlights and plenty of interior lights.  

Misc. controls:  The radio, A/C, cruise and other controls are easily reached and actually make sense.  Some car and truck magazines love to criticize the multi-control switches on the turn signal lever, but they make sense and seem to be holding up well.  Minor gripe--Chevy should put  a stereo with some power and decent speakers in this truck.  In the third-door extended cabs, they delete the speakers in the back.  One weekend, I installed two 4x10 inch 250 watt speakers in the back; made a huge difference in the sound.  Either a Blaupunkt radio or a decent amp comes next. 

Miscellaneous:  Good paint quality; doors close well; no problems with the third door; very little wind noise anywhere in the cab at speeds of 75+MPH; windows close tight; door hinges seem to squeak when they get dry and need to be oiled--this may be due to the Texas climate; interior plastic parts such as the seat recliner handles are not very durable--mine have broken once, and needed to be adjusted a second time; wish Chevy would spend a few extra bucks and design a hood that would stay up without a prop rod--that is a cheap design, but all small trucks seem to use a prop rod to hold the hood up 

Gripes:  None with the truck; a few with some, but not all, Chevy dealers' service departments.  Some of these guys couldn't find 'customer service' in the dictionary, not to mention understanding how to listen to or satisfy their customers.  CHEVY--ARE YOU LISTENING??   TRAIN YOUR DEALERS TO LISTEN TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND NOT TREAT THEM LIKE IDIOTS!!

Suggestions:  If you are in the market for a new small truck, catch one of these before the replacements for the S-10/Sonoma trucks are introduced in a year or so.  The S-10s and Sonomas should be very heavily discounted by the dealers and will probably have a rebate at least as large as the current $3000 offered by Chevrolet.
