            It seems this car has it all packaged appropriately. I shopped around other exotic cars and found the NSX provides the best value and performance combination. Gas mileage is exceptional (around 25 mpg). If  I have a complaint it is that parts are eye crying expensive ($360 for an interior door opening handle), and finding a local auto-salvage yard who carries these vehicles is limited (I do my own repairs). Insurance costs??? hey it's an exotic car, what can you expect! The horsepower/torque level should definitely be increased if you want this vehicle to remain competitive with other car manufacturers. But finding performance part suppliers can be difficult and expensive. Use of after-market engine performance chips provides limited "street" benefit for the associated cost. Considering supercharging??? Expensive and requires modification of the engine compartment lid (translation=ugly). Interior head room is very limited (I'm 6' 1" tall), leg room is excellent. Sun-visors typically crack along the vinyl mating surface near the mounting post. Save yourself some misery...Invest in a car bra and windshield heat screen. Interior noise level??? The rolling tires make more noise than the engine. Coach-work?? overall quality is excellent. The headliner could stand an improvement by the use of leather (currently plastic). Don't park in parking lots with narrow stalls or up near the front of buildings...door dings/dents are as noticeable as a sore thumb. I enjoy the two-tone color paint schemes better than the monotone version....would love to have this model in a yellow/black combination. I have manual rack and pinion steering instead of the electrical assisted version. It' s still fairly easy to maneuver into parking spaces. Tire wear???frequent and moderately expensive. Opt to reduce the camber a bit and save inside tread wear. Also go for a harder tire compound (against the tire salesman recommendation of course) unless you truly need the ultimate in cornering "G"s. Forward cabin visibility....excellent! Be careful to double check for side traffic when changing lanes. There's a blind spot created by the roof pillar (to the dismay of motorcyclists). At +110 mph speeds the front end gets light. Opt for a vented front hood. Look around if contemplating a NSX purchase. I was fortunate to find a 5 year old vehicle, with only 17k documented miles on the odometer, and in excellent condition. This, along with supporting technical automotive reviews, positively influenced my decision to purchase this vehicle.

Luggage???? Don't plan on carrying anything bigger than a small carry-along. It will easily accommodate a few grocery bags though.
