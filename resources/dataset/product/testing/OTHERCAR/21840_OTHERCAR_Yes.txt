            I'm the original owner of an 89' SE.  After 12 years, I decided it was time to purchase a new car.  My requirements were reliability, power/handling, and good 4 passenger seating.  I seriously considered a 330i but had concerns about seating.  Although the 330i really handled extremely well with great speed the seating was tight for 4.  I briefly considered a 530i but the cost increase was significant.

Recently I test drove a 02 SE and was extremely pleased with the car.  Every nit pick that I had with my 89 had been addressed with the 02.  And on top of that the car handled and performed great.  The power in this car is amazing.  My 89 is no dog but compared to this car its a slug.

If I did have to nitpick the two items I would say are 1) having a tough time find a car with the options that I wanted (side air bags, 6 speed, sunroof, Bose radio/cd).  I ended up getting one with leather and the meridian option.  And 2) the lack of traction control (none of the dealers had the limited slip version either).

In terms of performance, the 02 engine is about as much power as a FWD car can handle.  Torque steer is somewhat noticeable.  The engine really delivers on this car but it lags momentarily when you stomp on the gas.  The handling is responsive but somewhat insulated from road feel.  Interior noise was good (considering 17" 50 series tires).  The dashboard layout is a bit confusing given the extra options.  However the radio controls on the steering wheel were worth the extra money.  The bass is somewhat muddy on the stereo so I dialed it down.
