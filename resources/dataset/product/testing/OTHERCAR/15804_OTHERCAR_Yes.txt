            I love cars, particularly those that can be exciting and fun while still delivering good value.  The concept of buying something out of the &quot;sports car&quot; field doesn't really go over too well with me but the fact is that on long trips these fun animals can get a bit hard to live with.  Enter the fact that I recently got my hands on a 5-speed, V6 Solara to take a long trip that my beloved Integra wasn't up to (or rather the third person wasn't up to an extended amount of time in the back seat.)  The design of this car does little for me but hey, at least it only has two doors and takes a stab at a sporting personality!  Once driving it though I was quite impressed.  This car is an excellent combination of handling and comfort.  The ride is very smooth and quiet, far more like an upscale model from Toyota's Lexus division or Acura.  At the same time this car knew how to handle curves with an ability that was more Audi-like than the Camry that it is based on.  I have to admit that after six hours in this baby I enjoyed every minute and truly had &quot;fun&quot; driving it while still arriving at my destination feeling much better than any like period of time in a sportier car could ever have allowed.  My passengers also enjoyed the ride which all they got experience since I was far too happy with the car to let either of them behind the wheel!  Now, I still don't know that I'm ready to make the move to a car that seems a bit on the &quot;soft&quot; side for my taste but I am truly impressed with the package Toyota has put together.  The engine and handling are right on the money.<br><br>
