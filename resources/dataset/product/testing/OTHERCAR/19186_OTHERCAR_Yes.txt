            We purchased our Toyota as a replacement for our 85' Buik.  We had spent a fortune fixing the Buik up and didn't want to do that again, especially when we spent a lot more on it then we would ever get out of it!

We initially were looking at 4Runners, but couldn't afford one, but we knew we liked the make.  After looking at several different small cars we came across this one.  All my husband had to do was start it up and we knew it was the car for us.  We were lucky to get a good deal on it, later while getting insurance, we discovered that we paid the exact book value.  

Once I got over the hurdle of learning to drive standard I found it is a very enjoyable car to drive.  We also were happy to find how easy it was to install our CD player, we thank the designers for making the space so adaptable! Since buying this car, I've noticed that Toyota was far ahead of the competition in their interior design.  The comparable cars of the same year do not seem to have the same quality of interior design and layout.  As we don't have any children yet I don't know how difficult it is to put car seats into the back seat, but the back seat seems pretty roomy for a compact car. 
 

This is our third car, and I know we will keep it for a long time to come.  Mechanically, we haven't had any problems in the 41/2 months we have owned it. We want to make sure that we keep it in excellent condition, which seems is going to be a breeze compared to our experiences with the North American makes.  

All in all, we love our little car!
