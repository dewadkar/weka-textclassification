            When I bought my Saturn I just got married and then I was a PFC in the Marine Corps stationed in Hawaii, where the cost of living is unbelievable, not to mention on my pay!  We were looking for an inexpensive car with great gas milage, and that was stylish at the same time.  I got all of that with my Saturn.  The gas milage is so good, that I get about 325 miles on a 10 gallon tank.  Isn't that enough in a car?!?!  It also came equiped with a Clarion system and a 6-disk CD changer; something that suprised the hell out of me.  

My only problem with the Saturn SC-2 is that it doesn't have many horses pulling it.  More like small woodland creatures if you want to know the truth.  But get the standard and you can make up power with a little high shifting.  In case you are looking for speed, I have brought it up to about 115, but I have to admit that I had the help of a big hill.  Straight aways, about 90.  Needless to say that you aren't going to be the king of the drag strip with this one, but then again, Saturn never claimed to be.  It also has a little room problem that effects me now since the arrival of my 5 week old son.  The new Saturns with the 3rd door does help out alot in that department.
