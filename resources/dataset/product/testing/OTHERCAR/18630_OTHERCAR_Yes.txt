            I have two children, yet unlike mainstream America, I refuse to drive a minivan.  I went shopping for a two door, sporty yet roomy, fuel efficient vehicle , and I found it in my 1999 Olds Alero. My main concern was enough room in the back seat for a comfortable ride without buying a four door.  My kids, age 10 and 12 could not fit in the back seat of a Mustang, but two long legged adults can ride comfortably in the back of my Alero. The front passenger seat moves well, making it easy in and out from the passenger side only
  I really liked the Dodge Avenger, but the Alero had a slightly bigger engine , and was price almost $4000 less.  I have plenty of power, quick acceleration, great turning radius, and get a consistent 24 mpg./city, 28 to 30 mpg/hwy. The back seat seatbelts have a nifty gadget that lowers the shoulder strap height to a comfortable kid position (or for a short woman like me). One complaint is that the middle back seat is terrible, and no one could ride there for very long.
 I like the fact that my car is not one of a million just alike on the highway and people constantly ask me what kind of car I'm driving.  This car is not as much fun to drive as my 68 Corvette, but it is a great family car, without looking like my mother's car.<br><br>
