             I bought this camera because of its low price I paid 89.00. I have used it with Win98 and WinME and have had good results. It does like light and works best outside however I have had some indoor shots come out good. To shoot indoors you must have a steady hand. I mainly use it just as a camera and like the 8 megs of ram I can take a lot of pictures before I have to download them. The USB works perfect and the pictures download very fast I have not had not problems with the drives. I have used the camera with many different imaging programs with good results. I like the size and weight of the camera and the fact I can stick it in my pocket. I have used the camera as a web cam with Net meeting and it worked just fine. I like the tripod socket and use a tripod to help me get indoor pictures that look sharp. I am very happy with this camera. <br><br>
