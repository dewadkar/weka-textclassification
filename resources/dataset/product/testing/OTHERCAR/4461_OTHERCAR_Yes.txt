            The VW Cabrio GLS is a wonderful small sized car with a very sporty feel.  I was very timid when buying a convertible, and since my previous car was a '87 VW Cabriolet, I knew that I couldn't live without another.

The ride is like floating on air.  I haven't been in too many cars where I can recall how comfortable and smooth the ride has been.  The top goes down quickly and flawlessly.

My leather interior has upheld beautifully (no cracking or teers) and still looks and smells like new.  The car is spacious enough for a small compact car -- but if you plan on packing a lot of people into it, I would search for something else.  Although, it seats 4 (including driver) comfortably.

As for the noteable features on this car -- it has duel heated front seats that come in handy on cold CT mornings, heated side mirrors (which also come in handy on cold mornings), a 6 CD disc changer and sound system.  The sound system has to be the best I've heard from any car factory.

As for reliability -- she's only been taking to the shop once for her annual 5,000 oil change.  Other than that, she runs great and looks great too.<br><br>
