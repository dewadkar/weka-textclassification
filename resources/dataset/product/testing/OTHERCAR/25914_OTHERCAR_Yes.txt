            The Olympus 4040z is a great camera. Especially now that prices have come down quite a bit (I bought my camera online for $620.00)

One of my "pet peeves" when it comes to digital photography is that I hate it when manufactures use proprietary devices (battery packs, flash adapters etc.)with their cameras. While the 4040z requires a special flash adapter to trigger an external flash, it does use standard sized AA batteries (although they are not included with the camera). One can buy a set of NiMH batteries and a charger for $25.00 and extra sets of NiMH batteries only cost $12.00 or so. If you happen to run out of power, one can always buy a set of AA to get through a days shooting. (My thinking anyways---make up your own mind if it is important to you).

The 4040z uses Smartmedia card which currently maxes out at 128MB. The compact flash media is more common and has higher capacities, other than that they are relatively the same. Unless you have a stock of one card type or the other this should not make any difference for the average user.

The lens on this camera is terrific (f-stop is 1.8) and takes great low light pictures.Absolutely amazing clarity of focus. 4 megapixels makes your images stand out and look more like film.

Camera "warms-up" relatively quickly for a camera with a retracting lens and shots can occur relatively speedily.

Menu on the camera is a bit confusing.
