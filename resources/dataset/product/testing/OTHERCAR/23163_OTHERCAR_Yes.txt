            I own a 1990 Infiniti Q45. With a little help from Jim Wolf, its a luxury car mans dream. But, without any help from Jim Wolf, the "NEW Q" is its' daddy. The early models, such as the one I have, had too much torque for the trany and caused the vehicle to rip it out after so many miles. I replaced my transmission at 163,000. When I bought it, the dealer told me, "look to replace it at @170,000". The know their cars. 

Do you know all the specs? 0-60 in 5.9. How many 2 ton executive smiley faces can do that? Would you like to go back to high school and shift it? Sure, it has an "auto-shifter" in it with NO clutch needed. The rear seats recline so the passengers in the back can actually take a nap. OH, the seats are heated back there too in case you get a little cold. Did I mention some Porsches have sensors in the tires that monitor and adjust tire pressure while gauging tire wear? Meet your 2 ton Porsche. 

Did you know the in-dash computer screen is voice activated and recognizes 'words' as opposed to voice tones so anyone who can say "radio on" can listen to Frank Sinatra? The in-dash entertainment system of course multi-tasks as a 6 disk CD player control, DVD player, GPS and rear view camera? Ok, if you didn�t know, you know now. The part I like is the rear view camera. Exactly how far can I back up before I hit that car when I�m trying to parallel park? 

If you get the sports package, you'll get 18" rims and tires in case you feel the need to tell route 66 how you feel. While you're there, be sure to keep the BOAT in the trunk in-case you want to stop off at any near by lakes. Trunk Huge. 

Now without any enhancements, my 1990 Q45 went 144 mph governed. I know because when I got to 144 the car backed off a few miles an hour as though it were running out of gas, gathered itself again, hit 144 and repeated the thirst for propane scenario. Well my mom always told me I was a knuckle head and never liked to be governed by anybody! So I got rid of the governor. We don't need no stinking governor!  So, without the governor, I added new intakes, valves, dual exhausts, new transmission, catays, and a chip. It surpasses the 160 mph suggested top speed on the dash. I�m pushing just around 331 horse with no NOS. What�s the point? The "NEW Q", which is made by NISSAN, a racing car company, has a 4.5 litre V8 with 340 horses that goes 0-60 in 5.9 seconds with no enhancements. They should have changed the dash to read 180. 

If you're 6'8 you'll fit comfortably with someone 6'5" sitting behind you. You'll revel in the thought of having separate climate controls, separate music controls, heck, complete separate luxury environments for each passenger. 

Take a look at a Mercedez Benz S600 for a minimum of $30,000 more and tell me how many features you find on it that are not on the "NEW Q". While you're counting them, stay out of the fast lane, you just might slow me down.  And don't try to put your foot hard on the gas pedal either, you will get passed regardless...
