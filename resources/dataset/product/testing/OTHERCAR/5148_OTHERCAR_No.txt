            I would agree with Mrstark's opinion in regards to the new Dodge Dakota.  I recently ordered a Dodge Dakota Quad Cab 4x4.  The 6 cylinder seemed a bit doggish to me.  Opting for the 4.7 liter new for this year in the Dakota,  I was blow away with the response of this little v-8.  Sticker shows a mile or two per gallon better gas mileage that will remain to be seen.  If your looking for the roominess of a full size with the ride of a car  this one can't be beat.  My wife rode in the back seats during the test drive and she had no complaints.  She's 5'7&quot; and with the drivers seat in the fully extended position her knees did not touch the seat in front.  I liked it because I could extend my legs completely and just touch the firewall of the vehicle.  Would highly recommend to anyone that is over 6' and looking for a good truck. Well, I received the truck on February 6th of 2000 and for the first month it was in the service department for 10 days.  I think I got a lemon but I'm not sure.  I have a factory representative coming to take it for a ride.  I'm am very interested in the opinion of those of you who own one of the new quad cabs as mine has a front end that can't stop making noise.  The shocks seem like they are not engineered for this vehicle.  The front end is tight but it seems that on every bump, even the tar sealing that the highway department has done is felt and heard.  It is a very muffled sound but is very irratating.  I can't stand it.  I took another quad out for a ride and did not notice it but mine is bad.  They changed out the shocks and it seemed to quiet it down a bit but not completely. My wife thinks I'm drawing it out a little as it is a truck but I've driven many vehicles and this seems too much for me.  The other thing I would like to tell everyone is that I'm only getting 11 mpg average.  Really stinks with todays technology.  Thought I would get the 14-16 that the sticker says but no dice.  Not economical at all.  The first week I was getting 9 Mpg. Was really upset.  Also submitted this to the dealer when it went in the first time and got the usual answer that this is not a warranty item and they could not do anything about it.  People with full size Ram quad cabs get better gas mileage with the big 360 CID and the old 318 CID than I'm getting with this new 4.7.  If your looking for economy this is not the vehicle.  After talking with one of the service managers about this item he stated that the dakota is on the same chassis as the Durango and the gas mileage on that is very terrible so why should I expect to get better than what it gets.  Very upsetting!!!  I would not recommend this vehicle if you want good gas mileage, but if that is not a problem with the exception of my front end problems the only other thing I don't like is that the radio needs to be blasting when you got the defroster at full speed.  Very loud fan.  Does not adequately defrost all the windows when you have 4-5 people in the vehicle.  Well gotta go for now will update again in the near future after the Rep drives the vehicle!! <br><br>
