            This is my third Cadillac STS. I love this car, especially
since the last one I owned, a 1997 Cadillac STS saved my life.

I was hit by a driver who ran a Stop sign and also drove me into
a third car. The 1997 model sustained over $20,000 damage and
I walked away with little or no injury's because of the design
survivability this car provided. In fact, because the car was
one month old, the dealer rebuilt this car over a two month period
and I drove it until I traded up to the 1999 model, with no problems after
the repairs.

The fact this car could be repaired at a reasonable cost, and using
Cadillac new replacement parts, is a testament to the engineering
this car had designed in it. I doubt few cars could sustain the 
damage this car received, and still let the driver walk away.
Maybe a Mercedes at double the price would have offered the same
protection?

I owned my first model, a 1994 STS and immediately loved the
power and luxury this car provided.

The 1999 model was drastically redesigned and new features make this
car a true sports car. With a top speed of 150 mph, I always feel
secure at any speed. It is a true thrill to be able to pass on a two
lane road and know you have lots of power to make a pass safely
with no feeling of panic you won't make it.

I will lease another in 2002 when my present lease expires.<br><br>
