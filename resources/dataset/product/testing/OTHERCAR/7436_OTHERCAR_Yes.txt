            The Grand Am and, its twin, the <i>Olds Alero</i>, are fine mid-sized sedans/coupes.  I recently test drove the <i><b>Grand Am SE1 sedan</b></i>.  Although I wasn't overwhelmed, I nearly purchased one.  

The mid-sized sedan segment of the market is dominated by <i>Camry</i> and <i>Accord</i>.  Both models receive rave reviews from the car mags.  Perhaps it's a personal problem, but I just don't like Japanese cars. I am fed up with the decades of Japanese presence in the U.S. marketplace.  The styling on the Camry is too cookie-cutter for me.  And you won't find a ton of amenities per dollar here.  

Korean models offer a lot of bang for the buck.  But, their reliability history is seriously flawed.  Their styling, with the exception of the Italian designed <i>Daewoo</i> lineup, is reminiscent of 5 year old Japanese cars.  Besides, I would be embarrassed to tell my friends that I bought a new Hyundai.

Finally, I love European makes like <i>VW</i>, <i>Audi</i> and <i>Volvo</i>.  If I was to purchase one, I would have to opt out of several options that I would like to have like a <b>sunroof</b>.  Both VW and Volvo require a buyer to purchase a <b><i>$2,000 option package just to get the Sunroof</i></b>.

After reading up on the Grand Am/Alero, I decided to put these on the top of my test-drive list.  I found that I could equip one with all of the features that I'm looking for and still be about <b>$2 grand under my budget</b>.  Plus, these cars do have a sporty appearance and according to the literature, both can be had with a German made 5 speed mated to the 4 cylinder.

I arrived at the dealership and asked for Cynthia - whom I had spoken with on the phone.  She was nice and <i>did not attempt any high-pressure tactics</i>.  However, she did not seem very knowledgeable and had to keep referring to the brochure for answers.

I asked how long she had been working there.  She said &quot;about a month.&quot;  While I was talking to Cynthia about the Grand Am, my girlfriend was outside looking at cars and another sales rep approached her.  He told her that he had been there about three months.  I wondered why this dealership has such a high turnover?

As I approached the car, I noted the <b>distinctive Pontiac look</b>.  The sides have these 3-ribbed panels clipped on.  I guess that's supposed to make the car look longer and/or faster?  It definitely screams &quot;look at me.&quot;  <b>This is one car that looks good with the optional spoiler</b>.

However, I think the styling is a love it or hate it thing.  My guess is that the novelty would eventually wear off and I would learn to hate it.

The car is larger than previous Grand Am's.  The interior has plenty of room for 4 adults; with more space up front and a little cramped in the back.  As on the outside, the interior has a very distinct style.  I would consider it to be <b><i>Bat-mobile</i></b> like.

Each of the gauges is housed inside of it's own rounded little hub and are black with red markings.  The shifter and the controls all have a sporty-space-age feel and look.  

Since I am in outside sales, I tested the seat comfort.  <b>Yes</b>, I could handle endless hours of sitting in the seat.  The trunk would be adequate to hold my sales materials.  It also includes 60/40 fold down rear seats with a <i>large pass-through</i>.

The sales person first took the reigns and drove around the parking lot, turning, stopping, and making me sea-sick in order to show me what it feels like to ride in the car.  Ok, now it's my turn.  Once I located the <b>ignition on the dashboard</b>, I turned the key.  It started right up.  

I began driving and was instructed that I must drive a pre-determined route.  As I drove, I was thoroughly unimpressed with the <b>4 cylinder engine</b>.  It <i>does not</i> have a smooth power curve.   It <i>does</i> have a rough sound.  And, matched to the Auto, the power is barely adequate.  However, pressed to the limit, it will do the job.  I imagined that if I was to purchase one of these cars, it would have to be mated to the <b>5 speed manual tranny</b>.

The SE1 did handle and stop very nicely.  I kept thinking that this is not a bad car for the money, and if I could just order that 5 speed, I could be happy.

So, after looking at a handful of other cars, <b>I decided to order one</b>.  I called Cynthia, and she was happy to hear that I'd like to order a car.  I told her how I wanted it, and she said that she would search regional dealerships first and get back to me.  About an hour later, she called to say that the Grand Am is just <b>not available with a 5 speed</b>.  Further, she said that this was her last day and referred me to another rep.

Well, since <i><b>the brochure says that the 5 speed is standard on the SE and SE1</b></i>, I called Pontiac.  After being placed on hold for 15 minutes, the customer service rep told me that &quot;no, the 5 speed is not available.&quot;  When I asked why, she could give no reason.  I thought, maybe Olds has their act together, so I called Olds.  Nope, <b>the 5 speed was scrapped due to an unknown problem</b>, but it will be available next year.

I decided to sleep on it before deciding if I still wanted the Grand Am.  The next day, out of boredom I suppose, I decided to visit the <b>Saturn</b> dealer.  The <b>LS1</b> turned out to be the car for me.  If you're interested in finding out why, check my review on that car.

The bottom line on this car is that it is <i>adequate, has distinctive styling, and is a good value</i>.  This was the runner up in my new car shopping and is definitely worth a look.  However, I feel that the Pontiac division and my local dealership have <b>some serious problems</b>... especially with training and retaining their people.  <br><br>
