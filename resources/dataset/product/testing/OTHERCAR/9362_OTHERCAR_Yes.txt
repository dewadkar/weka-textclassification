            This camera rocks! Quality is completely controllable. You can choose from everything automatic for great quality shots, or you can choose semi-auto to adjust exposure and aperture, or choose the fully automatic mode to adjust focus too. You can shoot in the dark or in bright light. Comes with 3 ISO settings, exposure control, and control over the built-in flash (+- 2EV). You can take pictures fast - no waiting for storage. Olympus really needs to add USB to a camera of this quality. However, you'll want to invest in a USB card anyway(try the Lexar ones) with cable to quickly copy pictures to your computer - so the point may be moot. This camera is perfect for the novice who is tired of lousy looking digital photos or for the semi-pro. I previously owned the Olympus D340L (point and shoot) which only shot good photos in perfect lightly. The flash was always overexposed, the focus on low-light photos was fuzzy with motion blurs. All of these problems go away with the C2500-L.<br><br>
