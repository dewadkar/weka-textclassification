            The Chevy S-10 pickup that I have is my first truck. I had no idea how I would take to driving it. Especially since I was the one who would drive it the most. Now being a woman, I always prefer a small and simple car but after driving this truck I am so confident with it. We had bought this truck because my husband had wrecked our buick and felt he owed me a vehicle and this was the cheapest yet reliable one on the lot. We took a three year lease on it to avoid any high payments. 

Everything is easy to use from the steering to the gas pedal. I also like having the bed room as in my little cars there wasn't much room to store things in the trunk. There is also a nice storage area behind the seats. Just enough room for toys and shopping bags. I also enjoy riding high as well. Its easier to reach the drive through windows and boxes. Maneuverability is very easy. No trouble in parallel parking. 

However, as with all good things there are some downsides. There isn't a lot of room in the cab for a growing family. When we originally bought the truck, we only had one daughter at the time and that worked out well since she was older and could fit in a booster seat. Car seats don't fit well in the middle of this truck. Now with a new baby only one adult and the two little ones fit. My lease will be up in a year from now and until then,I am going to enjoy my first truck.<br><br>
