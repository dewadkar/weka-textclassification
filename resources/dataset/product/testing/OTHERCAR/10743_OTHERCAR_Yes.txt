            I bought a Tribute in September after looking for 2 months for a new vehicle. I was searching the internet for my newest car, when I saw the Tribute. I called my wife over and told her that was my new vehicle. I went the next day and traded my POC for a Tribute DX V6. I was a bit upset that I could not get the options I wanted, the model I bought was supposed to come with power mirrors as a standard feature. Sticker showed a $50.00 marked off because they weren't there. The salesman told me that this was the last shipment (they had 3 left) they would be getting for a while, evidently the factory can't get enough parts for the vehicle and were stopping shipments. I bought one and the sales manager said that as soon he could get the mirrors he would call and install them for free and also threw in the premium sound system because of the shortage. I highly recommend this vehicle to any one looking to buy something &quot;different&quot;. It handles like a dream. It is a good, solid vehicle. Hope you enjoy yours as much as I enjoy mine. BTW, salesman was so good, we went back 2 weeks later and bought my wife a new 626.<br><br>
