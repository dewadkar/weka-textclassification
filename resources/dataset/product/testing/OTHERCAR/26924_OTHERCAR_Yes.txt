            My husband and I leased this vehicle back in May of '98.  Before I purchased the Camry, I always said I would buy American.  I always owned Buicks... a Pontiac once and a Chevy, but otherwise always a Buick.  Then my Buick started running into some problems that were major... We had it about 4 years.  Seemed that American cars always gave me some big headache after 5 years or so.  My husband and I decided to start looking at all the car-makers.  When we found the Toyota dealership, our car was on the carpet in the showroom.  Granted, it looked nice, but I wanted something &quot;sportier&quot;.  I argued the point a bit, but after a little persuading I took it for a test drive.  What a difference! The seats were very comfortable.  I am 5'2&quot; and with the manual adjustment of the seat I could see over the road perfectly and was at ease.  (The great thing is, my husband is 6'1&quot; and he also loves the feel of being behind the wheel!)  The controls on the dash were in easy reach for me, including the radio, the A/C-Heat, and everything else you'd need... It's all right there.  But the best thing I like?  It's those shocks.  It felt like I was in an airplane.  NO BUMPS - extremely smooth ride.  And now over a year later it's still a smoother ride than my next-door neighbor's car which is BRAND NEW.  The Camry gets great gas mileage and has plenty of trunk space.  Back space is average - maybe a little above average in spacing.  We have an integrated child seat for our 3 year old.  He fits in it perfectly and regularly falls asleep in it; it's that comfy.  Radio buttons did break 2 times... had to have radio replaced completely; they couldn't just fix the buttons but had to replace the entire radio.  That happened 2 times, but that's our only complaint.  It's just a great car and we highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for affordability, safety, and class.  <br><br>
