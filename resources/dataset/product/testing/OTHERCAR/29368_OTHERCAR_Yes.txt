            I'll admit it:  I bought my 1998 CR-V for its looks.  Well, that's not completely true;  I knew I wanted a smaller SUV and had checked out Consumer Reports--the CR-V came out near the top, along with the Toyota Rav Four.  But the Rav 4 is, let's face it, weird looking, and the CR-V, on the other hand, is quite adorable.

But once I got past appearances, I've been quite pleased with my car.  The CR-V handles extremely well and is really comfortable to drive.  Although it looks small, it's actually quite roomy (I've fit 5 people and rambunctious Labrador in it happily).  Thus far I've put about 28,000 miles on it and have had no mechanical problems whatsoever.

Its 2 weak points, as far as I can tell, are that it doesn't get very good mileage (about 18 miles to the gallon) and it doesn't have much in the way of pick-up.

But damn it's cute.<br><br>
