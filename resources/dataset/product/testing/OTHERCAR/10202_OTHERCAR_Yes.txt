            In 1992, Lexus had begun to establish itself as a premier player in the luxury sedan market and was beginning to cause serious concern to its European counterparts.  Fresh on the heels of the smashingly successful LS and ES sedans, the SC was released to rave reviews and won Motor Trend's coveted Import Car of the Year Award.  For its time, the SC was unlike anything on the road, and was leaps and bounds ahead of its competition.

The SC was never about competing, however.  That the SC remained, for the most part, unchanged for a decade, speaks to the timeless elegance of this automobile.  The SC was, and is today, an expensive automobile and not a very good value, all things considered.  To own an SC was to indulge yourself, designed for those individuals with a marked penchant for the finer things in life.  

I remember sitting in an SC on a Lexus showroom floor when I was in high school, and being astounded by the artful beauty and coddling opulence of the luxurious interior.  Fast forward a few years, and I'm looking for my first car.  I found a great deal on a 1997 SC300 that I couldn't pass up.  This was one of those rare cars (along with the BMW 540i and the latest Mercedes S class) that you can covet for years and would buy used because it still represents something special.  

Admittedly, the one thing about the car I bought that swayed me was the fact that it came with a manual transmission.  I did not think Lexus ever made any stick shifts, with the exception of the early ES250's.  I've been at dealers for oil changes and it is always fun to see their reaction when they realize it's a stick.  It's a big enough bonus that I am dedicating this paragraph to it.  It has a short throw, precise detentes, and a solid feel as it grips the next gear.  It's not as precise as a BMW transmission, which are simply amazing in their ability to practically leap into the next gear for you, but it is very impressive for Toyota/Lexus and is very reminiscent of the stick shift in the Nissan 300ZX; I would not be surprised if Toyota lifted this tranny from Nissan given their past history of collaboration.  A coupe is a very personal, very intimate car, and being able to coax the silken smooth, bank vault-solid powertrain with direct linkage to your right hand is a thrill that never grows old.  

I must admit that I drive my car harder than it was designed to be driven, only because its engine has a sonorous note and begins to pull like a locomotive around 4,000 RPM.  This car was clearly designed more for the older audience who could afford it, not for a 22 year-old easily influenced by films such as Ronin and The Transporter.  I don't believe Lexus ever made the SC 400 ever available with a manual, but if you ever see one, buy it on the spot and you've guaranteed yourself smiles for the next several years.

However, as I said this car was designed more for luxury, and it will most likely not satisfy your desires for an athletic, roadgoing GT coupe.  It rides harsh for a Lexus, transmitting the slightest bumps and breaks in pavement into the cabin.  It handles quite nicely, but that's expected as it's rear-wheel drive.  Body roll through the corners is perhaps more pronounced than it should be, but it does have a low, sleek, wide profile that aids somewhat in your runs through the twisties.  

Even today, this car is a work of art.  Its exterior is clean, stately, and eye-catching; what may have once been considered cutting-edge is today not necessarily mainstream, but the car definitely ages well.  It still attracts plenty of looks and comments.  In 1997, Lexus retouched the front and rear fascias, lining the tail lamps in tasteful chrome accents and revising the front spoiler, fog lights, and air intake enclosure.  It is still a very sharp looking car and will be remembered as one of Lexus' best, if not best, design.

The interior, as I said, is a work of art.  The dashboard climbs gracefully upwards from the center console, and is awash in just the right number of oversized knobs and instrument lighting.  Wood trim wraps around the cabin in all the right places, and it actually looks, if not feels, like real wood.  The seats are comfortable and highly adjustable, right down to the lumbar support.  This car is perfect for two people of any size.  With the front seats all the way back, the cabin is airy, sweeping, and downright spacious.  Send anyone to the backseat, however, and that all changes very quickly.  I would not recommend seating an adult back there for anything longer than a few minutes time, although I have had some of my shorter friends sit back there for hours on end on road trips and not hear them complain once, but it does cut into the front seat legroom.  

Creature comforts abound.  The steering wheel is motorized; it moves up and out of your way when you take the key out, and moves back into position when you place the key in the ignition.  I would rather have the cd changer placed in the glovebox but since it's a 12 disc changer it's not as much of a nuisance.  The passenger seat, when flipped forward to allow someone access to the backseat, automatically slides forwards and then slides back to the point it feels contact so as not to crush the person in the back.  There are two cupholders, in seperate locations.  The one in the dash is somewhat flimsy but it is fancy in its operation.  The headrests tilt and telescope, and when you tilt open the sunroof it automatically opens the HVAC vents so your ears don't pop at speed.  There is a small trip computer that indicates outside temp, avg MPG, etc.  Overall there is not much storage space, although the center console is deceivingly deep and can hold quite a bit.  

Given the chance, I would purchase this car again.  As I said, I bought it used, and there are other newer cars out there that appeal to me, such as the G35 and 3-series coupes, but I'm not ready to spend that kind of money yet.  If you are in the market for a used SC, you can rest assured that you are purchasing a top-quality automobile that will not only deliver reliable, bullet-proof, if not overly exciting, performance, but also a high-class and very rewarding experience.
