            The Chevy Cavalier has got to be one of the most boring small cars out there.  If you haven't been able to tell from my last auto reviews, I like a car with a lot of spunk and playfulness. This one has neither. It's not a car you look forward to driving every day, it's just simple transportation. I think you can get more car for your dollar somewhere else.

Chevy is famous for their <b>dependability</b> and <b>durability</b>. The Cavalier doesn't dissappoint there. My mom's old '88 is still going strong (with a different owner). During the 8 years we owned it, I don't remember once having to bring it into the shop for anything except a tune-up and my friend's <b>2000 base model</b> hasn't given any problems at all except a flat tire (which of course isn't the car's fault).  She has two kids aged 5 years and 10 months she needs to tote around, and the cavalier is perfect for that. You can feel pretty confident you won't be left stranded on the side of the highway, and the standard child safety locks provide added piece of mind. 

The <b>ride</b> is choppy and uncomfortable. It's not the worse ride in the world, but it's not bearable for long car trips (read:30 minutes). Driver, passenger, front and back seats are poorly designed, providing very little support and digging in all the wrong places. It basically feels like cloth, a thin layer of padding, and cardboard. You can feel every vibration of the road. <b>Engine and road noise</b> is about a 3 on a 5-scale. It's pretty loud. If you have the air or heater on, the radio needs to be turned up so you can't hear anyone talk without raising your voice. If you actually want to hold a conversation, the radio has to be turned to such low levels you can't hear it over everything else. 

<b>Visibility</b> is good. There aren't any unusual blind spots, though the car sits somewhat low to the ground, more than what makes me feel comfortable. It feels like every car on the road is bigger than I am.

<b>Manueverability</b> (I really ought to learn how to spell that) leaves something to be desired. The wheel doesn't respond the way it should, needing a good, hard, concentrated turning to make it around the corner. The particular car I've driven (my friends 2000 base model) jerks during lane changes and is hard to keep straight while looking over your shoulder. It doesn't do much to help you out. It feels heavy, too, almost like it doesn't have power steering. It takes some effort to control it. 

<b>Acceleration</b> is acceptable. It gets up to speed in a decent amount of time to join traffic on the tollway, though it won't make you yell out in joy over how fast it is, and it does take a little longer than what I would personally prefer. You feel like you're waiting on it.  The reason is that the <b>engine</b> is abysmally small, only 2.2l, 4cyl, and (gasp)115 hp! 115 hp! That won't get you anywhere! Shocking.. The 150 hp engine is an option on the LS, which is recommendable. Much better, and only about $1500 extra. Worth it, I think. 

<b>Fuel economy</b> is quite commendable at 24/34mpg for the base model and 23/31mpg for the LS. That's the one aspect to this car that makes me proud.  If you don't want to visit your gas station all the time, this car could be a good choice.       

Finally, the <b>interior</b> leaves something to the imagination. The gadgets and gizmos are plain and basic (no cd player, not even optional), and not even in the best position. I can't see the fuel or mph gages when I have the seat up to where it's bearable (I won't say comfortable) for me to drive.  I can't even get to the radio without leaning down too far to see. 

I just don't like this car. It's not exciting, peppy, or playful. It doesn't have any get-up-and-go. Even family cars aren't this boring. I figure this would be a good, inexpensive car for someone who just needs transportation and isn't going to have a love affair with their vehicle.  The <b>body style</b> is unremarkable, average even. Everything about this car is average.  You won't bound out to the driveway in the morning, aching to get behind the wheel, and you'll be glad to be out of it when the ride's over.
