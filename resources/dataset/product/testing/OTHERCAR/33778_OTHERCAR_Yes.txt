            I bought this car because I used to work as a valet and remembered driving these cars years ago, and really appreciated the pick-up they had.  Not to mention the many &quot;creature comforts&quot;.   Well, I was shocked to find out it was a five-cylinder.  Very odd, but you'd swear you had six based on the horsepower.  

Well, Acura decided to stop production on the Vigor after the 1994's.  Now they have TLs, CLs, Whatever-else-L's...

Overall, it really is a great car.  Very reliable.  I have only had to replace a muffler, and I had an oil leak from a distributor cap seal that cost $120 to fix.  Other than that, I have owned my car for a year now, and only paid for routine maintenance.  Mine has 94,000 miles, and no, it is not for sale.

I have only minor criticisms of this car and they are:

-A complete lack of cupholders.  I know that's a minor thing, but the aftermarket cupholders look cheap and I refuse to buy them.  How could they forget this????

-It has &quot;Oh, sh*t bars&quot; in a strange location in front.  I'm used to them being directly above the windows.  They probably should have been left out entirely.

-The windows are frameless.  Which I think is cool, but they go down cock-eyed sometimes, particularly the rear ones.  In fact, the rear ones do not go down all the way (which is typical), and they come to rest at a strange angle.

-Premium Unleaded only?  I don't know if this is actually necessary or not, but I do as I'm told and only give it the pricey stuff. You'd think they could make it to run on regular gas.  Then again, when will they make a car that runs on water, and the only by-products it produces are oxygen and granola bars out the tailpipe.

One final tip:  Make sure you get the radio code from the guy you buy it from.
