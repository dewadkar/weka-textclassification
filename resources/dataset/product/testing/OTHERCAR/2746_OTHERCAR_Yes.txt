            I bought this truck as I got outta high school as a sort of a present for myself.  When I first bought it, the 94 model, it was a strong running vehicle.  But now that it is 2000 it is starting to fall apart.  It first started out having no problems, fast acceleration, good starts, even idle.  Then over the years with regular maintenance problems started to occur.  I was driving cross country, and my transmission went out, which was 1400 dollars to get replaced, then the freeze plug on front passenger side of the engine wore through. I didn't even know that a freeze plug could wear thin?  When it was replaced, you could push a screwdriver through it with almost no force.  Then the EFI has started messing up,  making it hard to start,  almost dying at stop lights.  Had the throttle sensor replaced and that cleared that up, but now the torque converter is starting to go out.  Making it hard to keep running at a stand still.  But after a little bit of work,  I think it could be back up to running shape.  <br><br>
