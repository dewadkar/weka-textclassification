            I have to say I've been spoiled by my 1990 Honda Accord EX with all power stuff and I truly expected more out of my 2001 Corolla, but it wasn't meant to be.

When I first drove this car I loved the way it handled and the pickup it had.(Honda was a little stiff handling and pickup was slower).  I didn't notice the noise factor until later. (No noise in the Honda) I kept thinking a window was slightly open at first but it wasn't. 

The temperature control on this car leaves something to be desired. (No problem with control in Honda)If you try to use the air conditioner and don't want it on cold, the adjustment has a tendency to give you cool air thru the dash vents, but on the floor you get warm air. So when you adjust to get the air on the floor cool enough, its too cold thru the dash vents.  Also, you can only close the two outside dash vents, the two in the middle stay open all the time.(All vents on Honda closed and no problem with air temp. on floor.)

The first time I drove it in high winds I thought I had a flat tire. First it veered right and then left.  Well it didn't take long to figure out it was because the car is so light. (Great for gas mileage but bad for handling in higher than normal winds.) I never noticed a problem with the wind and the Honda.

I was also disappointed with the fact that the only thing standard in power options was windows & door locks.  No power steering, cruise control, or power antenna on the LE model I have. (Which the way I read the write-up on this car should have been standard as this was the high end Corolla model.)Small trunk. All these things were standard on the Honda. Also nothing sporty about it.  You can add a spoiler to get the look for about $500.00.

With all that said there are some good things about it too.  As I said before it handles great (unless in wind) has great pickup, corners on a dime, has a over drive button to help with those times you squeeze in on interstate. Smooth ride, comfortable seats & headroom & has map lights. No lighted mirror but has mirror on both driver and passenger side. Lots of storage compartments in console, dash and has cup holder for back seat. As everyone else has stated the back seat has very, very little leg room.

The only mechanical information I can really give you is the oil stick is easy to get to, as well as the radiator and washer fluid.  Also has locking gas door.  Did I mention great gas mileage?
