            Many are the reasons we buy SUVs, but if yours is to demonstrate that you are an advocate of conspicuous consumption, this is your vehicle.  The price ($55K - $66K) keeps all the riffraff out; when you motor this baby down the road, you KNOW you are being noticed.

Amenities include 10-way dual power leather seats.  Obviously a lot of Corinthians paid the ultimate price for the comfort of your not inconsiderable behind, but why not: you're worth it!  The &quot;dual power&quot; modifier refers to a scheme only the Brits could come up with: primary power is the usual electricity, while the backup is a clever methane capture and power generation system that can provide hours of 10-way seat-adjusting fun, provided you eat the right foods beforehand.

The vehicle also sports a 6-disc CD (plebeian at best but reportedly due for an upgrade to 50 discs in the next model year).  Recommended tunes to entertain those unfortunates in your path:  Flight Of The Valkyries, These Boots Were Made For Walking, Hail Britannia.

Four trim packages are also available.  Regrettably, this is one of the vehicle's weakest features.  British automotive engineering being what it is (how did Great Britain simultaneously produce some of the greatest Formula I drivers and some of the sorriest cars mechanically the world has ever seen?), however, one should rejoice at the fact that the battery doesn't run down every time you park for over 2 hours.  In 6 months, when the trim starts falling off the car, just yank it all off for a cleaner, &quot;aero&quot; look.  Or save yourself some embarrassment with the neighbors and remove it the first time you get it in the garage.

What I Like About This Car: Term &quot;Rover&quot; in its name correctly acknowledges its canine lineage. 

What I Hate About This Car:  No flower cup on the dash, ancient map of the British Empire lining the glove box (it's over, people!).

What Is It Like To Drive This Car:  Are you kidding?  When I asked the guy at the dealership if I could take it for a spin, he asked me if I thought it came with a free bowl of soup and sent me packing.

Who Should Buy This Car:  People who deserve more than the rest of us and (heh heh) believe this car will deliver it.

Who Shouldn't Buy This Car:  Struggling Third World countries whose GNPs fail to keep pace with this turkey's sticker price.
