            The first review pretty much covered the features of the camera so I'll save you the extra reading.

This is the second Concord Digital Camera that I've owned.  The first was a similar one, the Eye-Q Duo 2000, which is about every bit the same as this one except the Go 2000 has a macro mode (for really close up pics) and it makes a sound when you take a pic.

This is a great camera for someone who just wants to take pics and occasionally takes a video clip, but be warned that there is NO SOUND.  It almost seems silly to take a video clip without sound, however I have had a situation where I used it to prove that a DVD player I bought from eBay was Dead On Arrival.

Like the first review, the amount of memory that came with the camera is hardly adequate, but with $50, you can buy a 128mb memory card at Sam's Club.  Then you'll never find yourself short on memory.

I've literally taken thousands of pictures with this camera.  I seem to have an odd problem with battery life.  The first battery lasted me about 600 pics (most taken during the day with no flash).  Then the second battery lasted only like 100 pics (mostly day with no flash).  The third one lasted me well over 1,000 pics (mostly day with no flash) while the 4th battery only lasted more like 400 pics (mostly day with no flash).  I cannot come up with a good theory on why the huge difference in battery life cause I've always used well known name brand batteries.  Also, these batteries are not rechargeable as mentioned in the first review.  They are made out of Lithium, which is also used in rechargeable lithium batteries, but this particular battery is not rechargeable.  Also, my experience with battery prices are more like $5 per battery (name brand).  Checking on eBay will yield much better pricing for no name batteries.

Also, the colors are not as crisp with this camera, but what can you expect for $75.  It can easily be corrected if you have the proper software (e.g. Photoshop).  In the pictures I want to keep or pass along, I just have photoshop auto correct the color balance and the levels and I get crisp clean images.  When doing so, I get many compliments about how great the pictures look.  Yeah, it's a hassle, but to replicate that kind of quality, you'd have to spend many times more than $75.

The camera is also very rugged, for I carry it everywhere with me in my inner coat pocket without the case that came with the camera.  Whenever I feel like taking a picture of something, I just whip it out and snap away.

The camera is well worth the money I spent on it, plus more.  I highly recommend.
