            As a high school senior who had been promised the family car when its replacement was purchased, I grew tired of weekend after weekend cruising car lots with my stepmother, who searched in vain for her next set of wheels. A look at Saturns, Mercuries, and a host of other autos named for celestial bodies proved fruitless, so I steered ole mom to a known winner--the Honda Accord. Her EX model came well equipped with power everything, alloy wheels, cd player, and moonroof for around $20,000.  In the first year of ownership, it had a few minor problems (the trip meter and odometer conked out at 12,000 miles, and one of the tweeters developed an annoying buzz.)  These problems were repaired under warranty.  

The car is quick, and the five speed manual shifts smoothly.  Though my stepmother is terribly lax in maintenance (she often goes ten thousand miles or more between oil changes) the Accord has logged nearly 100,000 miles with no mechanical problems whatsoever.  Compare this to the used Mercedes 300 D that my father bought later the same year--which blew its engine at 100,000 miles, and you will see what great cars Honda makes.

The factory sound system is excellent.  Our local dealer provides excellent service. She broke the ashtray once, and they replaced without her asking, and at no charge, when it went in for an oil change.  The dash layout is clear and sensible, and the interior plastics are top-notch.  The cloth seats have worn well (quite a compliment when you have a young child romping on them.)  

On the downside, I wish the moonroof had a tilt feature to allow ventilation.  Also, the trunk must be SLAMMED to close properly. Otherwise, this is an excellent car for those who seek practicality and performance.  Perfect for commuters, the Accord can rack up miles with no problem (Friends own an '87 Accord with over 220,000 miles on it, and to ride in it you would think it had 50,000).  

All in all, the whole family loves this car.  I don't think my stepmom has ever kept a car more than two or three years, but after five, she vows to drive this one until it falls apart...and given it's stellar performance to this point, I imagine my eight year old brother will be learning to drive in it.

UPDATE
The Accord is now nearly eight years old, with over 150,000 miles on it.  Though it no longer turns heads, due mostly to the fact that nearly every body panel is marked with a dent or scratch, it continues to provide reliable service to our family...still with the original clutch...and still without any repairs outside of expected maintenance.
