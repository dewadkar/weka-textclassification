            I bought my first Saturn used--a cherry deal w/only 6,000 miles on it, back in '94.  Loved the car so much, that after it was totaled by a speeding SUV (in which I nor my daughter sustained any injuries), I immediately went and got another used one.  

Though the second had over 50,000 miles on it, and had been driven hard by the previous owner, I've only had to replace the alternator (under extended warranty), and have the original brakes replaced (at 70,000 miles!).

The car is affordable, a lot of fun to drive, manuevers well, and has an outstanding turning radius.  It is very comfortable, even for long drives, the controls are conveniently placed, gets good gas mileage, and handles well in the snow. The exterior finish hold very well, and the claims of the &quot;bounce back&quot; panels are accurate--I was rear-ended by a driver whose car had hydroplaned into mine--the dent in the bumper bounced right back, though I did have to get the paint job retouched.   

Another good selling point is the customer service by Saturn--you aren't treated as just another customer, they are very helpful, easygoing, and accomodating.

The only downsides I can think of is that the drive is much smoother than those of others in its class, but could be better, there is some rattling of the plastic interior at high speeds    


I'd recommend this car enthusiastically, especially for people who like the convenient pleasure of a sedan that drives like a sports car, the reliability of a car that starts in the coldest temperatures, doesn't overheat in the worst heatwave, and the ease of a car that is easily parked virtually anywhere.

Now if only they'd make an SUV!<br><br>
