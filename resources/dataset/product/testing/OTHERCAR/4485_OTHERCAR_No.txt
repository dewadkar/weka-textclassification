              I had the opportunity to spend a couple of days driving the ML320 and I have to admit that I was disappointed. I long ago noticed it's rather bland high box style and was not suprised it continued to the interior. The controls are at least useable and for the most part, understandable. A marked improvement, no doubt Chrysler's contribution to the Daimler-Benz/Chrysler marriage. The climate controls in particular. They are of a rotary dial type and much easier to use than prior Mercedes have been. (There are probably still teams of German scientists and mathematicians trying to interpret previous designs from Mercedes and BMW) The wiper control is HUGE and mounted on the right of the steering column where a gear selector would normally be located. I wonder if any have been snapped off inadvertantly while an unattentive driver tried to select park? The Bose stereo was nice but a bit more difficult to understand than the Infinity stereo in the Jeep Grand Cherokee. It seems to be the sign of a luxury car to have that maze type gear selector and the ML is no exception. It's really only a minor inconvenience for awhile I guess. As I mentioned before, the interior is a bit too spartan for a vehicle in the $40k price range owing more to the Nissan XTerra than the Lexus RX300 that it competes with. Gone are the "springy" seats that Mercedes used to have replaced with a more firm seat. Mercedes enthusiasts will probably not like that departure. I could always tell when I was driving a Mercedes by the heavily oversprung seat. Either that or an Iveco box truck, either way something big and European. It does have a lot noisier ride than the only (distant) competitor I have ever driven for awhile, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, but if the RX300 is like other Lexuses (Lexi????) I have driven, the Mercedes needs a lot of improvement.
  Under the hood was disappointing as well. I was greeted by a huge plastic "beauty shroud" (an obvious misnomer) that may as well had, "No User Serviceable Parts Inside" stenciled on it. Ok, gearheads wouldn't buy this kind of truck but still... At least the coolant reservoir is easy to check and the engine oil dipstick is easily accessible. What I assume to be the transmission dipstick is labled, "MB workshop only" I guess the transmission fluid never needs to be checked by the driver. The engine has 12 spark plugs. Not the easiest to get to but not incredibly difficult.
   I didn't get a chance to fully test it's off road ability. It's supposed to be phenomonal. Each wheel is independantly computer controlled to maximize traction instead of just forward and rear axles like the CRV. Most owners won't ever fully utilize this off road and too much ability to create foward momentum is often a 4X4 SUV's shortcoming in wintery weather. Drivers often assume that because they can get moving better than cars that they can stop better. Most cars only use two wheels to move but all use all four wheels to stop. SUVs do not have any more brakes than your average Camry or Taurus. The ML seemed to be pretty surefooted but then again, there isn't any ice on the roads in Dallas in April.   
   Overall, this seems to be a case of Mercedes selling a three pointed star on a substandard vehicle for the price.

UPDATE: 
   Recently I read a report classifying the Mercedes M-class as unsafe. Not so much for the occupants of the Mercedes but for the vehicles involved in a collision with it. I know that doesn't concern many but should be considered when a moment of inattentiveness (spilled coffee, cel-phone, attending to small children that I know are safely secured in the back where they belong, lighting a cigarette...) causes a collision and severely injures someone else's loved one. It seems the ride height overrides the safety capabilities of even 5 star rated cars like the Ford Taurus. Even the morbidly obese Ford Excursion has a "blocker beam" arrangement to prohibit running up and over the hood of smaller passenger cars and directly into the passenger compartment.

  "...in particular, the Mercedes M-Class...is actually more dangerous because of it's 8.4 inch ground clearance according to a new study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. (IIHS)"   source: insure.com
