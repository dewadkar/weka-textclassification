            If you would like to check out how I financed my 1999 Elantra GL, check out my review of CarFinance.com.

At the beginning of last year, I decided that we needed a new car. Now, at the time, I had a 1989 Hyundai Excel and my wife had a 1986 Volvo 740. These cars were only somewhat reliable due to their advanced age and mileage.

I did all my research for a new car online, you know, dealer websites, car magazine websites, and the best of all, www.edmunds.com. I had a few cars in mind for our first new car. The Ford Escort, the Dodge Neon, the Toyota Corolla and the Hyundai Elantra. I was leaning toward the domestic cars because I was tired of paying higher prices for repairs on imports. I checked out the Escort and the Neon. They were both fine cars, but to get the options I wanted; which just were: A/C, 5speed MT and AM/FM Cassette stereo, they cost about $14,000. Just a little bit more than I wanted to pay. The Neon was a also a bit rough on noise and engine idle. The Escort was perfectly fine, but it does not strike me as a nice looking car. So, onto the Corolla. The Corolla was perfectly acceptable, except for the unimaginative styling and a sticker of $16,000. If you have ever been to a Toyota dealer, you know they don't haggle. At this time, I was also checking out the Elantra. The price could not be beat. I paid $10,300 for a new 1999 (Feb '99) Hyundai Elantra with A/C, 5speed MT and an AM/FM Cassette stereo.

But the Elantra had so much going for it. The price, even with rebates and deals, no one could touch the price of the Elantra. The warranty, a 10yr/100,000mi power train warranty, 5yr free roadside assistance, 5yr rust guarantee (inside and out), 3yr bumper to bumper and 1yr everything covered. Other car companies may have one feature that approaches Hyundai's warranty in this price class. But no car company had the complete package. The styling is nice. Cat-like and curved, it looks like Hyundai took some styling cues from the Pontiac Grand Am. The engine, 4cyl inline, DOHC, 2.0L and 140 horsepower. This is why I chose the 5speed. Small car, nice engine and MT? It's great on gas, 32 mpg all-around. Great in snow with FWD and the turning radius is the smallest in it's class.

It's quieter than the Neon and Escort. It's almost as quiet as the Corolla. The fit and finish is better than the domestics, and comparable to the Toyota.

There's so much more to this car: great sound system, comfortable seats, the most leg room, the largest passenger cubic foot room, the second largest trunk, great driver seat and instrumentation, nice controls, standard internal dampers for seatbelts, child proof rear lock, safety anchor for child seat, the first engine developed exclusively by Hyundai, retooled from the older Elantra engine.

I did my homework as you can see. Even though, I wanted to buy domestic, I bought another Hyundai. Also, this is the base model. The GLS model adds: trip computer, rear spoiler, auto trans and other options if you want.

Consider this car, you won't be disappointed.
