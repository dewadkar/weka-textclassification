            I bought my 1992 2-door Sentra-E in 1996, when it had 66,000 miles on it.  I drove it to work every day (approx. 100 miles round trip) for six years, and have taken it essentially coast-to-coast about four times.  It now has greater than 207,000 miles and still runs great.  I changed the oil faithfully every 3,000 miles, and changed tires every 40-50,000 miles, replaced the countershaft and front seal, CV boots twice, and the brake pads twice.  And after 200,000 miles on one clutch, that had to be replaced only this summer.  I have calculated the gas mileage since I've owned it, and it regularly yields 34+ mpg.

The paint is starting to flake, despite regular wash and wax jobs.  That is probably a function of the fact that it has always resided outside in the hot sun with no shade since I've owned it.  The cloth lining in the interior is beginning to separate from the ceiling.  My only other complaint is the considerable wind and road noise.
