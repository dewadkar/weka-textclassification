            Just when you thought that new Luxury SUV was the epitome of stylish durability, the new Jeep Liberty came around to top it. I just got my new 2003 Liberty about a month ago and I love it. Prior to this car I had owned a 95 wrangler and thought it to be the end all, be all of cars, but then again that was in sunny California. I moved out to upstate New York and needed a car that would not only keep me warm, but be safe in the snow lake effect of eastern NY.

  I initially became interested in the Liberty because of my loyalty to Jeep. Although in recent years Chrysler Corporation has gotten a bad name for it's quality of cars, the Liberty brings a renaissance to this old manufacture. After the merger with Daimler the company decided to show it's new goods with this outstanding SUV.

  The car brings new style to the SUV market. Is it a Wrangler, is it a Cherokee? Well...it's both. Consider this vehicle a quasi-insestual love child with the rugged strength of the Wrangler and the refined beauty of the Grand Cherokee.

  On the road it's as smooth as a kitten&#146s purr. Great handling and a powerful 6 cylinder engine give this car the powerful feel that the Jeep name is known for. But what I find really great about the car is the new interior. It's like opening the door to a jeep and sitting in a mercedes. A friend of mine has a C-class and you can definitely see the similar desghin in the new liberty. I've driven this car from Michigan to New Jersey and it's as comfortable as can be the whole time.

  The only real draw back is the car can tend to suck gas, especially when in 4 wheel drive. I was also looking at the new Honda CRV with it's great mileage and new styling, but the power just wasn't there. So although it dose kind of guzzle, you definitely get your powers worth out of it. I also got the second to the bottom of the line, and it shows in the stereo. It would be nice to have that "11" so eloquently described in Spinal Tap and the Liberty just doesn&#146t have it. If you&#146re interested in buying one I highly suggest you get the upgrade option on the stereo.

  So in comparison with other SUV's in it's class I find the Liberty to be the step above. Great looks and power on the road makes this a great car for anyone who's trying to make the statement "Damn I look good, and I can perform too if ya know what I mean".
