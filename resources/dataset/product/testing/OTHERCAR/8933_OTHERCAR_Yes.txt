            Last Spring, I was unfortunately in a car accident. Thankfully, I was uninjured but my car war totaled.  This left me with the opportunity to purchase the vehicle I really wanted, a minivan.  

As a family, we test drove two minivans, the Pontiac Montana and the Dodge Grand Caravan.  At first, I was attracted to the Montana due to the ability to flip the back seats forward for extra room.  However, after driving both vehicles, we decided we liked the way the Caravan drove over the Montana and this was more important to us.

The ease of getting our kids in and out of the minivan is heavenly.  No more broken backs lifting them into their car seats.  Actually, my four-year-old daughter uses the convenient child safety seat.  The dual side doors are a must.  I would never have purchased a minivan without them.

As far as roominess, we have never felt cramped or have never filled the minivan to capacity, even on a camping trip with both kids and a couple of friends. When extra room is needed, we can fold both back seats down so the entire length of the van can be used.

So far, we have recommended this van to my husband's sister and our friends who both bought one and love their Grand Caravan as much as we do!
