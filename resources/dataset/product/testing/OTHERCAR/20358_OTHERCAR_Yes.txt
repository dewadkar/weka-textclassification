            When the 2003 Viper was first shown in Detroit and then in various auto magazines, we were disappointed.  At the time we owned a 2000 GTS in black with silver stripes.  A stunning automobile design, the car commanded attention from the newborns to the nursing homes and everyone in between.  The SRT-10 did not have that "in your face" styling of the previous Vipers and many Viper owners stated that as soon as they saw it.  The new styling seemed to encompass many current sports car cues such as the Corvette C5, Honda S2000, and even the now-departed Chevy Camaro.  It also borrowed heavily from the Dodge styling family, especially the Stratus convertible as seen from the rear of the car.  All in all, nothing to knock your socks off if you already owned a Viper and liked the audacious looks of the GTS.  The only thing promising about the looks was the improved interior layout and a true convertible top - as compared to the "toupee" of the RT/10.

What overcame that trepidation was the promise of increased performance in every single category: Bigger engine, more horsepower, better brakes, and a better suspension resulting in better road holding.  Initial numbers for the SRT-10 showed a 505 cubic inch engine (8.3 liters) producing 500 horsepower and 525 ft lbs of torque.  Performance was estimated with 0-60 times of 3.8 seconds; 1/4 mile of 11.7 seconds @ 124 MPH; and top speed of 190+ MPH.  Even more impressive were the estimated braking numbers of 60-0 in under 100 feet - the first such production car to achieve those numbers.  The skid pad estimates were also phenomenal - 1.15 lateral G's.

So, with improved performance and lukewarm looks in mind, we placed our order for our SRT-10 in January of 2002.  Almost a year to the day later, we took delivery of our black Dodge Viper SRT-10.  The first thing we found was that the car looked a LOT better in person than any picture we had seen - and we had seen a LOT of pictures (you tend to look for them when some $85,000 is involved).  Indeed, the first thing 95% of the people that see it say is "Wow, this car looks MUCH better than the pictures!"  Was it as visceral as the Viper GTS?  No.  Was it far more refined and "complete"?  Yes.  The one observation that many people had about the previous Viper was the "kit car" nature of the beast: Ill-fitting body panels, cheap interior, poor ventilation and A/C system, etc.  The SRT has addressed those shortcomings and then some.  There is no question that the SRT has improved on every single bit of the previous generation Viper, even if the looks are more mainline.

So, we have had the car for almost five months and 3,000 miles (winter slowed us down).  What do we think of it now?  We love it.  It is faster, lower (albeit it with greater ground clearance), and is simply a more driver-friendly car.  Still a bit much for a daily driver, largely because of the excessive power and race-car-like suspension which can occasionally rattle your teeth on some of the less maintained roads (potholes, etc.).  Surprisingly, the car generates almost as many looks and whistles as our previous GTS - if not the same.  The new styling seems to appeal even more to those desiring a less "cartoonish" look, as many reviewers attributed to the earlier Vipers.  While the old Viper would attract the muscle car crowds, the new one adds the exotic and luxury marquees (BMW, Ferrari, Mercedes, etc.) to the list of admirers.  And why not?  It is, after all, the product of a comfortable marriage between Daimler (Mercedes) and Chrysler.

We have had a few very minor fit-and-finish problems, including a headlight housing mounted incorrectly.  Much of this is probably due to the fact that this was an early production car in a brand new body style.  While ours was not one of them, some cars also suffered a slight horsepower deficit when the supplier of the valves for the motor shipped them before they were properly finished.  DaimlerChrysler has gone to great lengths to remedy this problem, but it is still a bit disconcerting for an $85,000 car.  The performance was all that was promised and more.  A recent dyno testing of our car revealed some 517 horsepower and a staggering 575 ft. lbs of torque.  Stab the brakes at 70 MPH and you will find yourself on the brink of losing consciousness due to the negative G-force.  The brakes are indeed THAT good.

The bottom line is that even with slightly more subdued styling, the Viper is as wicked as Bob Lutz first intended when the original Viper was unveiled in 1989 at the North American Auto Show in Detroit.  The new interior is greatly refined with race-inspired seating that will hold you firmly in place no matter how fast the car is going in any particular direction.  The return to a side-exhaust satisfies the muscle car lover in all of us, while the very low and very wide profile immediately brings to mind the exotics of Lamborghini and Ferrari - at less than half the price.  Best of all, the car is a performance benchmark in almost every respect.  You need fear nothing built in America today, and can generally count on beating anything on the road that costs less than $200,000 - race bikes excepted, of course.  Hand assembled in Detroit, this is what American Muscle has always been about and what the Viper has now taken to the next level.  The only question that remains is "Where's the Coupe?"
