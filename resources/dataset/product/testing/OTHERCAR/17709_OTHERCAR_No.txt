            The Saturn SL1 is not as I had expected it to be.  I have had many problems with it from the beginning.  After the car was only a year old, it needed a new gasket for the transmission.  The following year we had engine problems.  I have been back and forth to the shop several times since 1995.  I highly recommend getting the extended warranty, if it wasn't for that, we would have paid a lot of money out of our pocket.  With the additional warranty, most repairs were no charge or a slight deductible.  And the car was covered for 6 years or 60,000 miles.

There are a few things about the 1995 SL1 that have been ironed out and changed with future models.  For instance, the way the roof of the car is curved on the 95 model causes water to drip into the passenger seat when you open and close the door.  The newer models have been changed to alleviate this problem.  Also, the car tends to rattle and has a lot of cabin noise when it is on the highway.  The car appears to ride smoothly, but the noise in the cabin can be a distraction.

One good thing about the Saturn is the highly advertised crumple zones.  The side cage in which the Saturn is made of is durable and reliable.  We encountered one slight &quot;parking lot&quot; accident in which the car did become dented.  However, the impact of the hit seemed to be cushioned.

I have found that the paint quality on the Saturn isn't that great.  Living in New England with frequent snow/ice storms in the winter left numerous nicks and paint chips on the car.  The paint does not seem to be scratch resistant either.  

The car does get good gas mileage both in the city and the highway.  I would not recommend a family with a young infant this car as car seats seem to be difficult to assemble in the rear seats.<br><br>
