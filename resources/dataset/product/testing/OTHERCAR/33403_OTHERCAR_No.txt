            This car I purchased new in May of 1999 from our local VW AUDI dealership. It is the NEW 1999 Jetta . Often called the 1999 1/2. You could hear air noise from both front doors. When it rained water came in on the drivers side. Construction Flaw/engineering #1.. The glove box broke a total of 4 times. It freezes in the winter and when you try to close it, even slow, it breaks..The dealer says I'm shutting it too fast and it's my fault" He even put this on my work order. (meanwhile everyone is having this same thing happen) Winter is soon here and I expect it to break again...Engineering Flaw # 2. The power locks on the driver side was replaced once. The vehicle was running rough, and the engine annunciator came on. $350 later they changed the O2 sensor , and my wires.....I week later the same thing. I suggested it was fuel contamination....They said no...Tuned up the car...more $$$ and back I came 1 week later...same problem...Now they changed the fuel filter..guess what the car ran fine. Trouble shooting at my expense.$$$ By the way the warranty ran out at 45,000 km..No warranty....Then I find out from VW that the O2 sensor had been recalled...Now why did I have to pay for one.?? So my car is due for it's 64,000km inspection....ching, ching.$$$$ $900.00...let me see they changed the rear brakes, rotors, pads sliders, carriers,quoted metal on metal...YES TRUE, the belt was changed the plugs were changed, the mirror's were replaced...apparently the defroster burnt out,air filter, pollen filter, oil, and filter,wipers...the radio antenna mast was u/s the cup holder was broken..(I choose not to replace these since they wanted $53 for the mast and $83 for the cup holder. The good thing is that I now have earned loyalty points..YES, $15 dollars worth, If I come back for service I can use it..What do you think?
