The 2000 Mercedes-Benz ML55 AMG is the &quot;fastest SUV on the planet&quot; Mercedes did something very smart. They put an AMG engine in the ML and turned into an off-road sports car. 

<b> The Interior: </b>

      The interior of this car has more cons than pros. The rear seats are made of full grain leather but there is very little legroom and the seats aren�t very comfortable. The rear sets would probably be uncomfortable for the average sized adult. The front seats are slightly more comfortable. The dash has lots of great features like CD player and a great stereo. The dark walnut trim looks nice and gives this �off road sports car� a touch of luxury. The white chrome instruments and the GPS Navigator wont let you get lost in your off-road adventures (a $65,000 car�off road? Yea right!)

<b> The Engine/Specs/Other: </b>
       
      Mercedes packed it with a 24-valve, 5.5 liter V-8. The AMG powerplant produces 345hp and 375lbs-ft of torque. Think that�s awesome... The ML55 can pull 0-60 in 6.9 seconds! Lets see if the BMW X5 can do that. Behind the V-8 is a 5-speed automatic with TouchShift(Mercedes remarkable new gear system). The 2000 body was given a beefier rear bumper, some cool looking fog lamps, and thicker rocker panels. The facelift is sure to attract plenty of &quot;ooh's&quot; and &quot;ah's&quot;.  The ML55's capabilities seem to be endless, whether off-road or on smooth pavement. The steering is incredible for on and off-road, you will be very pleased with the suspension. Maintenance is a big issue. This car will literaly fall apart after some pretty heavy use. And the price of repairs will never go down.There is also significant roll when turning rtight corners.

<b> The Clich�: </b>

      But don't expect it to outrun a regular sports car or a sedan. This car is perfect for anyone, well anyone of course who is willing to pay $65,000. If you are looking at the M-Class I would only suggest this car; the ML320 and ML430 are absolutely the worst Luxury SUV's on the market.
