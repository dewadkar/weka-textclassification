I took delivery of my new Guards Red Boxster a few months ago.  It really is a pleasure to drive this beautiful car.  I really enjoy the sound of the sweet flat 6 right behind the seat.  The exhaust note is just incredible above 4500RPM.  I often turn down the stereo when I'm approaching a straight strip of road as I shift at the redline from 2nd to 3rd gear.  This is an experience that is hard to describe.  
Make sure you order the Sports Package.  It is well worth it.  
The Boxster is a very practical car for everyday driving.  There is an amazing amount of trunk space for a 2 seater sports car.  I often throw my 8&quot; golf bag in the back trunk and my golf bag cart in the front hood.  Perfect!!!  Try that with a BMW Z3 or any other 2 seater convertible.
Yes, I think the Boxster is a little underpowered for my taste, but 0-60 in 6.1 seconds is not too bad.  The handling on this mid-engine car is just out of this world.  The handling I think is the strongest talent of this car.
