            I have made my PT come alive! I recently installed the Borla dual exhaust. I bought the exhaust to give my PT a custom look. I got more than I bargained for, the difference in performance was worth every penny I paid for the exhaust. The box arrived in a timely manner after ordering the product from RAM Power(www.rampowerparts.com). I quickly installed the exhaust in about 1 1/2 hours and off I went. The sound,look and performance made this a swell investment. 
I love driving my PT before this, now I really love driving this vehicle. People stop me and ask me about the vehicle and the exhaust all of the time,it is amazing. PT owners check this product out you will not be disappointed by the appearance and the gain of power. I was one of those folks who loved my car but thought it lacked power. The addition of this exhaust has made me overcome the power issue, now I just LOVE the car. Driving the car with the exhaust gives you the feeling you are in something special and the is more than 4 cylinders under the hood. However, the sound is not overpowering, my neighbors do not have to complain when I leave for work at 6 AM. If you are interested I advise you to check it out!!<br><br>
