            I've been looking at getting a VW Golf/GTI for about three years now.  My former car was an old Nissan truck, and I was ready for a sporty, fuel efficient, city car.  I took my time looking...new and used, and all of the models/options (2.0 GL, 1.8T, 2-door, 4-door, leather/cloth....etc).   I finally settled on a 'certified pre-owned' 2001 GLS 1.8T w/ monsoon stereo.

Things I love:

-My 4 doors.  The GTI, though tempting with all it's power always got low marks because of it's 2-door trim.  Everything is easier; loading, unloading, carrying people.  

-My sunroof.  With the ability to open a sunroof the interior of the car feels much much bigger.  I'm not claustrophobic, but it feels tight with the roof closed and the shade drawn.  Let the light in!  It's worth it.

-My 1.8 turbo engine.  I drove the 2.0 liter engine, and it's perfectly fine.  I'm no Mario Andretti, but 150 horses worth of turbo under the hood make this car so much more fun.  

-My transmission.  If you want this car, but don't know how to drive a stick shift, learn.  The standard transmission makes a huge difference in this car, even with the 2.0 standard engine.  It's clear that a standard transmission is what the Germans had in mind when they designed this car.  

-My cargo space.  It's a little tedious taking everything apart (the cover off the back, the headrests, etc) but once you get it in place, the cargo space is awesome.  

-My 'certified pre-owned' status.  Getting this car used meant I got a great deal and the recall type stuff for this particular car (window regulators, sensors, coil packs, etc) had already been addressed.  Do your homework, look around, be patient, and when you find a 'certified pre-owned' in your price range, pounce.  

Problems:

-Nothing mechanical yet.  My old car had so many bumps, squeaks, and rattles that I'm hypersensitive and have been known to shut all the windows and turn down the radio in order to listen to a tiny noise that isn't really there-drives my passengers crazy.  It's not a luxury car, so there is road/engine noise.  But this car runs great.

-The lint...yikes.  VW finally wised up and used a different material for the 2003 seats, and thank god.  My Velour seats, especially the black/gray, are a bit of a pain.

Overall:

I researched it, and waited for the right deal to come along, and I don't regret it.  I love this car.  Do your homework, drive all the models, and I think you'll find that this car is functional, fun, and has the bells and whistles where it needs it.
