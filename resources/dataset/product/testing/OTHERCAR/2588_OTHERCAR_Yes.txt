            I tend to cling to what's comfortable.  At age 51 a couple of months ago, I purchased my first computer, but I went all the way with state of the art Pentium M and Centrino mobile technology.

When it came to a digital camera, I wanted to improve, if anything, on the camera I've been using since my dad handed it down to me, my trusty 1959 LEICA M-3, a camera that has seen and weathered 45 years of use, consistently returning super quality photos. My dad, a professional photographic artist, told me the one criterion that counts in high-quality photography, is OPTICS!  He said the LEICA chrome-encased, ground-GLASS lenses were of uncompromising quality, and he would not even consider others, (Nikon, Minolta, etc.) as being in the same league.

I read dozens of reviews on digital cameras, the LEICA review mentioning that LEICA's line of digital cameras was the result of a joint development venture between LEICA and PANASONIC.  The reviewer went on to say that PANASONIC benefited from the arrangement by having LEICA lenses on their LUMIX digital cameras!

I couldn't believe what I read about the LUMIX DMC-FZ10.
A LEICA lens with 12-times optical zoom!!  Good grief, that's the equivalent of having a 400+MM telephoto lens!

In addition, with PANASONIC's revolutionary image stabilization feature, even if your hands shake with palsy, you can take perfectly clear, crisp exposures using the 12 times zoom without a tripod!

It's important to understand the difference between optical versus digital zoom.  All digital cameras offer digital zoom of 3 times or better.  The problem with digital zoom is the resolution of your photo suffers, and the finished image will have more visible pixellation if you use the digital zoom feature.

NOT SO with OPTICAL zoom, because this uses the lens only to magnify your subject.  And when it comes to high zoom optics, I totally trust LEICA optics.  Also, I totally trust PANASONIC as a world-class electronics manufacturer.

The only thing I found fault with was the inadequate 16MB data card included. (Figure about 12 exposures average) So I purchased the upgrade to a 256MB card, which allows storage of up to 150 or so images.  The PANASONIC battery is good for about 120 exposures on a single charge, which should satisfy just about anyone.

I LOVE THIS FZ-10!  It's different, and is taking a bit of getting used to.  But WOW!  My first venture with it was to snap about 15 pix at my daughter's 21'st birthday dinner, at a dimly lit restaurant.  The on-board flash is great, and on full automatic, it's virtually impossible to not take a great shot!

The image clarity and resolution are quite comparable to what I've been used to on my LEICA M-3, however this LUMIX camera can do things my beloved M-3 can only dream of.  And, the LUMIX is dirt-simple to set-up and operate.

The LUMIX, while heavy by digital camera standards, is noticeably lighter-weight than the traditional analog LEICA, and developing and retouching are now much easier and less messy, as I simply download images into my PC rather than wait with a timer, going through chemical treatments and rinses, etc.

I'm not getting rid of the M-3, but I have a strong feeling this new LUMIX FZ-10 and I are going to have a long and beautiful relationship.
