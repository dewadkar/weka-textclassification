            Do you really need the newest 5-megapixel camera to take quick shots, print them on your PC's $150 printer, and fool your friends that they are Kodak prints? The answer is no.

This 2 Mega Pixel camera does a great job (on most settings) of saving 1600 x 1200 resolution pictures that when printed on photo quality Epson and HP inkjet printers on 10 mil glossy papers at 8x10 and smaller sizes looks excellent. Okay, I&#146ve taken some excellent waterfall shots that I wish I could enlarge to poster size, but they look great as my screen saver on a 17-inch monitor.

Just don&#146t make this mistake&#133 I wanted to take some inside basketball shots (it&#146s kinda dark inside) and wanted to free the action in a &#145sports&#146 type mode. There is no &#145sports&#146 mode setting, or any other programmed exposure settings other than auto, manual, and a favorite programmed setting that you set yourself. So I set the &#145programmed&#146 mode to ASA 400 (a way to tell the digital &#145film&#146 you are looking for speed) thinking this would do it. Instead all the pictures come out very grainy like a 1 megapixel camera. I unfortunately left it on this setting for a very long time and have lots of lesser quality pictures in my archives than I could have had.

Sometimes a good manual settings camera will let people make these mistakes. The Auto mode works just fine until you want to force the flash not to go off, or you&#146re taking pictures of night fireworks.

Other than that, this camera has been in briefcases, luggage pockets, rattling around in automobile trunks, dangling from backpacks, and has never let me down. I like the AA battery setup and use 2000mA NiMH rechargeables. If your camera batteries die, you just steal AA&#146s from the Game Boys all around you and keep shooting. My 64MB memory was worth the extra $ as well.
