            We purchased a used 98 land rover thinking that it would be the be all and end all of all cars.  Boy were we wrong.  My wife and I are expecting our first child and I as the dutiful husband noticed that she was grimacing over every bump.

We started looking.  She did not want to give up this Rover until we stopped to the Volvo side of a dealership I worked for (for 1 month).  There it was, the only other car I could have convinced her to buy, a 1998 Volvo V70 XC.  Fully loaded, I mean loaded.  Heated seats, rearview mirror defroster, 6 CD changer, leather seats, temperature control on each side of the car, 3 memory settings for your drivers seat, turbo, and a warranty to boot because Volvo certifies their used cars for an extra 2 years when they check out.  

Sitting in this car is like sitting in your favorite chair.  Everything is positioned within reach and the steering wheel is telescoping to ensure safety and comfort to the driver.  The seat moves 9 ways and, well, you just feel safe.  I will only touch on the safety aspects of the vehicle because the name Volvo is synonymous with safety.  There are of course air bags, front and a side curtain. There is side impact door beam that is made out of Boron (a much stronger type of metal).  There is a whiplash control that the seats will move with you to keep your head in a more supported position and seatbelts that adjust to give you more support to keep you in your seat if you are in a rollover accident.  Finally the woman that came into the dealership and told us that she was in two accidents that totaled her cars (Volvo&#146s) and she walked away from both.  My wife being a skeptic asked her for her business card and her drivers&#146 license because she thought she was a prop of the dealer.

We drove the non-XC version of the car the regular V70 and the difference is amazing.  The handling and suspension was a night and day difference.  The XC has the upgraded suspension and with the AWD the car handles nicely in any conditions.  It has three settings for the transmission, economy for the highway, winter which is a higher gear differential and the city setting which is does not shift you into overdrive in the city.  It has traction control that puts power into the other non-slipping wheels in a slippery situation.  

The car is also very classy looking and the sound system is not too shabby either.  The best part about it was moving from a full size SUV to a wagon and it being a Volvo saved us $600 a year in insurance.
