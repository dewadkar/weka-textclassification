                 From 1990 to 1995, I had a Corporate Lease with one of the local Rent-A-Car agencies.  The lease was a month to month on a Lincoln Town Car.  I started with a 1990, that had a Mustang 5.0 liter V-8.  I thought the 1986 Cadillac I owned was nice, but after feeling the power of the Lincoln, how responsive the car handled, and how small the turning radius was, I was swayed.
     I started doing research on the Town Car and I found that there are 3 models, the Executive (the base model), the Signature (the mid grade model which comes with a few more goodies), and the Cartier (the top of the line model, whereby many of the add ons and upgrades from the 2 lesser models are standard).
     I've driven every model and with the exception of the type of steering wheel on the up scaled models (you know, things like radio/CD/tape controls, etc. on the steering wheel), they all handle the same way.  There is no comparing the ride to cars like Lexus, Mercedes, Jaguar.  Those cars simply aren't large enough to simulate the smooth ride.  Even the new Town Car's ride doesn't compare.  In my opinion, the Cadillac Brogham has the closest smooth ride to the Town Car.
     I ended my Corporate Lease with the Rent-a-Car agency and about a year later went to a local dealership and leased a 1997 Lincoln Town Car for $34,500.  I went in with my own financing and was able to secure an Executive, (my preference) with leather seats, tape/CD, traction control (which I didn't want, so they didn't charge me), automatic seats, windows, mirrors, security system, etc... all the basic comforts found in a luxury car.  (By the way, I walked out on the deal at first because I wanted BBS style wheels and they didn't want to switch them.  But they called me the next morning 2 times to tell me they would do it.)
     I've driven the car to Florida 2 times in it and the handling is superb.  I have a digital display and a control center that allows you to see the engine mileage and efficiency, you can record your mileage with the trip indicator, you can use the center to tell you how many miles you can drive before you run out of gas, and it even converts from standard to metric.  It can comfortably seat 6 adults and if you need more room, you can fit approximately 4 to 5 more in the roomy trunk.( they would have to snuggle a bit, ha, ha.)
     Another nice feature is the way the computer controls the ride and leveling of the car.  This is the secret to its smooth ride.  When you use the remote to unlock the door, the car immediately seems to come to life and levels off.  Put it in gear and the doors automatically lock.  The only thing that I don't like is the way certain areas of the interior and trunk trim were not neatly tucked and hidden as they are in the imports.
     Overall, I would recommend buying a 1990 - 1997 Lincoln Town Car.
     In 1999, I bought myself out of the lease and with a residual value of $15,500, I got an extended warranty and a lifetime of free maintenance, due to a special package I purchased during the lease.  I have 55,000 miles on the car, I take it in for scheduled service and I haven't had a problem with it, yet.
     Just in case you think I'm an old foaggy that pets the car along, no way!  Although it's a luxury car, I expect it to perform; and it does.  When I mash that accelerator at a light, the 4.6 liter V8 rockets forward enabling me to take the next lane when necessary.  If I need to make a U-turn, it's turning radius is better than some small cars.  I'm extremely hard on a car and this one has held up better than my past AMC, Chrysler, Pontiac Grand Am, and Cadillac Coupe de Ville.  When I get another car, I won't trade this.  Well, 'Nuff said!
