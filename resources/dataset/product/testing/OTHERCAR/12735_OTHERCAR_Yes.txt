            I have 4 children that are on the run everywhere.  We NEEDED a van that was solidly built, decent on gas mileage since we live 45 minutes from town, as well as comfortable and roomy enough.  I found it with the Nissan Quest.  The kids like the idea of separate air controls, and I do too.  I like it warmer than they do.  This way, everyone is happy.  I really like the comfort of the driver seat since I have to sit in it for such long periods of time.  I also like the automatic headlight feature.  I can't praise my Quest enough!<br><br>
