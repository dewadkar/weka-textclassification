            Let me start by saying when I bought this car three and a half years ago, it was not my intention to by a &quot;Beamer&quot;.  I always assumed that the praises I heard were just the rantings of the self-absorbed narcissists who wanted to justify their importance.  

BOY WAS I IN FOR A SHOCK!!!!!

The first mistake for me was sitting in the car at the dealer.  Note I did not turn the ignition switch.  I just sat in the seat and fingered the console and looked at the dashboard.  &quot;Uh oh&quot; I said to my self as I thought this is what they mean by a driving machine.  Everything was within the touch of my fingers. It was as if someone had custom designed the interior (like a suit for me).  It felt perfect.  It scared me.  I hopped out before the salesman could latch on to me and ran out the showroom.  But alas, I could not resist the temptation.  A few weeks when I found a used one with only 12k on it and I took it for a test drive through the winding roads of Rock Creek Parkway, I was hooked forever.

Since that time I have had the pleasure experience of commuting to work in this &quot;driving machine.&quot;  Sometimes that is the best part of the day.  More 
importantly, it gets 30+ miles to the gallon in the driving I do.

There was one last experience involving its nearly flawless stop in the middle of a snow storm.  As I contemplated the cost of the damage I expected when it uncontrollably slid (into what for any other car would have resulted into an uncontrollable crash) toward a guard rail, I stomped on the brakes and held the brake pedal down.  As if the road turned into glue, the car stopped efficiently without any skid.

NEED I SAY MORE!!<br><br>
