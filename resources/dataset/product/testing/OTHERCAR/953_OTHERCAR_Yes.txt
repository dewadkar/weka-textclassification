            After 30 years and putting two kids through college, my husband came home with this little jewel.  And believe me, I started jumping and dancing around and have not stopped since then.   I have owned an Austin Healy 3000, a couple of BMW's and a hot little Mustang, but this car far and above exceeds all of them and even my dreams.  

What I really love about this car besides the way I can punch it and get on the freeway, is the speed and ease at which it holds the road. The &quot;heads up&quot; lighted dash in the windshield is a sure lifesaver and  makes the experience so much more enjoyable. You never have to look down at your gages, there in front of your eyes is your speed.  I love my Bose radio too.  

There are only two things that are a little annoying to me.  One is that the air in the tires needs re-filing every once in awhile.  The other is that the warranty is only 36,000, and you must purchase an extended warranty on these cars.  

Yes, I love this car. Yes, I am having a mid-life crisis and loving it. Yes, I see buying another one in the future. Yes, it is true, people who own Corvettes are the nicest people you would ever want to meet. If you want to have the BLAST of a life time, buy this All American car and live a little!

I would not recommend this car for teens.  It would be too easy to get into trouble with, but WOW its a great pick-up car!  <br><br>
