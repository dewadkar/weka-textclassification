            I got my Nissan Sentra as a nineteenth birthday present back in 1988.  Now, my husband is driving it :-)  We love that car and not just because it is paid for!  This car is like Dracula.......hard to kill!  Especially when I was the sole owner and routine maintenance was just too much responsiblity for me (if the car could talk, it would tell my husband how grateful it is that he married me because now it gets taken care of routinely.)  If you take good care of a Nissan Sentra, it will take care of you.  Right now, the car has seventy thousand on it.  The only thing serious that we have had to replace was the clutch (due to yours truly who has a bad habit of riding the clutch.) For a little four banger engine, this little puppy drives pretty fast.  Fast enough to endure Southern California freeways and lead footed me. It is fabulous on gas......especially in this horrible gas crunch.  The 15 gallon tank will get you to and from work for almost two weeks.  It is a great A to B car.  If you have a teen getting ready to drive, I highly recommend buying one of the older models like mine.  They wont be too embarrassed driving it and it will be much easier on the wallet for you. I would recommend anyone getting a Nissan Sentra.........they are great little cars!<br><br>
