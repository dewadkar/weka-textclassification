            I am now the proud owner of the Mavica 88 digital camera.  I had read all the reviews of most of the digital cameras on the market and am pleased to say that what others had to say about this product I can only echo.  I opened the box, charged the battery overnight, and was up and running the next morning. So far I have taken still and motion pictures, downloaded them to my PC and printed out the stills.  All works as advertised and I am not the fastest guy on the block with things new and different.  This camera is surely new and different from the point and shoot film cameras that I have previously used.  I chose the 88 over the 73 and 83 because of the greater telephoto capabilities.  It always seemed that I needed more than I had with the film cameras and didn't want to end up in the same boat with the digital camera.  
This camera is easy to learn to use, takes great pictures, and the MPG's are something else.
I got mine at Best Buy and also the 4 year warranty they offer.  At $15 per year that seemed to be a pretty good insurance policy.<br><br>
