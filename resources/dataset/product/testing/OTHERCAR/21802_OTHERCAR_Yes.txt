            I purchased my 1998 Trans Sport in June of 1999, after test driving a 1997 Montana.  I bought this model because it has the two back sliding doors.  That was the one thing Hubby said he wanted after driving the '97 Montana with just the one door in the back. Hubby was scheduled for a couple of surgeries  at USC, five hours from our home, and I really wanted something more reliable and comfortable than my 18 year old Escort for the many trips to LA!

The air conditioning and heat are super and there are controls in the back too.  The sound system is good.  I appreciate the cruise control and the intermittent windshield wipers. The power adjustments on the side mirrors are very nice.

This vehicle has plenty of room for large and small people and all their gear; and it is very comfortable, with lots of convenient cup holders and cubby holes for all sorts of goodies to be kept at hand.  

&quot;Harvey&quot; (because he is large and white)handles well on the LA freeways and on winding mountain roads, due to the front wheel drive and the ABS breaking system and the V6 provides plenty of power provide escape from tight situations. I get mileage in the low twenties on a regular basis. On long road trips the mileage is better, and most of the time I have the AC going.

What I don not like is there is a wind noise at certain speeds.  When the car is washed there is a small leak down the front window--this hasn't happened in the pouring rain! I cannot turn the headlights off at night if the car is running--I know that sounds silly! Being a short woman, it is very difficult for me to reach down to  manually adjust the seat front to back while I am driving, or sitting still as for as that goes!The Drawer under the front passenger seat is hard to open and is roomy but inconvenient to put things in and take them out.  The front defroster is a bit slow to un-fog the window.<br><br>
