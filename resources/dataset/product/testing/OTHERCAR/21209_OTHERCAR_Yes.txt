            Apart from having a so/so battery life and the most inappropriately located status indicator I've ever seen this has been quite a good camera.

I had high expectations of both colour and file compression quality when I purchased a Kodak, and while my expectations were met I was a little disappointed with the jpg compression.

In full light and flash conditions the camera functions fairly well, giving crisp colour reproduction and little glare. But unless used in 'night mode' shadowed light conditions tend to produce discoloured artefacts easily visible on a full sized shot. This problem can be compensated for by changing a picture's size in a program such as photoshop, but it was disappointing. 

Any night shots requiring the use of the viewfinder will be a problem unless you do what I did and cover the bright green status light with some tape (or something along those lines). I'm not sure what was going on in the mind of the designer but the camera was obviously not tested with the LCD screen off at night.  

Battery life is not as good as I expected, but not too shabby for a digital camera. Working with the rechargeable Kodak battery pack I average about five hours before a required recharge. Video and using the 'live view' function shorten this battery life considerably as would be expected with any digital camera. 

Video is stored in .mov format which is viewable in Media Player v.9 but may require many windows users to install QuickTime.   

The accessories that come with the camera, namely the lens cap, wrist strap, and battery were cheep and nasty. Investing in something of a better quality would be highly recommended.

Speaking personally, this camera was great when compared to other cameras in the same price range ($700ish Australian). There was also no other 3mpx camera available for anywhere near this price at my Christmas 2002 time of purchase. And while nothing a professional would use, this camera is fantastic for a family or casual photographer.
