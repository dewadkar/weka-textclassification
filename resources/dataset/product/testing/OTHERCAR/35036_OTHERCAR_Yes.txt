            Well it&#146s that time of the year again &#150 two years after taking delivery of the BMW Z8 (reviewed somewhere else on this site) the girlfriend had another fat banking bonus in her pocket and the urge to splash the cash on a motor that says &#145Flaunting it&#146.

As ever the brief was fast, well built, instantly recognizable and so sexy it stops young boys rolling out of bed at night (okay that&#146s an old Viagra joke but give a girl a break here okay?) The Z8 had been a faithful companion but the interior, the shaky ride, the monumental bills and the fact that it aged about as well as Bardot all stood pretty much against it.

It lost a fortune too &#150 but it still made enough to mean that we could swap it for a shark like Z4 and still keep all of the bonus money for a holiday home somewhere warm and Spanish speaking. Yup, we&#146ve halved the suffix and doubled the style &#150 we&#146re Z4 girls now and so far we&#146re both loving it.

Now many of you will have seen the new Z4 and hated it immediately. Many believe it to be (as one motoring magazine wittily put it) &#145the  car Bangle spannered.&#146 And it does look very different &#150 &#145flame surfacing&#146 isn&#146t just a theory in the forests and factories of Bavaria, this car bristles with incongruous lines, odd proportions and mad detailing. Some hate it but I think that the guys at the ad agency have it right &#150 this car looks like a shark, mean, purposeful and in perpetual motion. It has an innate presence where the Z8 had flash and it has muscles where the Z3 had a demi-wave.

To the details then&#133

Performance  

We bought the 3.0 litre&#150 a 6 cylinder more creamy than your grandmother&#146s rice pudding and an engine more than familiar to those of you who&#146ve had it push forward your 3 or 5 series recently. 231bhp keeps things moving along nicely whilst good torque everywhere in the range means that the short-throw gear stick isn&#146t meddled with unduly. Top speed is limited to 155mph and 62mph arrives in a claimed 5.9 seconds.

Whilst progress is swift it never seems achingly quick. If anything the unit is a little too civilized &#150 no Honda S2000 howls here. It&#146s an engine that&#146s willing rather than raw, a bit of a shame but then as I spend most of my time tootling up the Taconic highway at 55mph (honest officer!) that&#146s actually not quite the disadvantage I might have you believe here.

Ride & handling  

Talking of the Taconic the Z4 is much better to drive than the Z8. Those nasty scars caused by grandpa and his Buick Sofameister deluxe (replete with Driver&#146s seat by Lay-Z-Boy) are soaked up by the Z axle suspension rather than by my spine and whilst you do get some feedback through the wheel it&#146s informative rather than threatening.

Grip is good &#150 imagine Anna Nicole Smith&#146s grip on the hand of her ailing billionaire husband and you start to get the picture. Rigidity claimed to be best in class and you have to believe the claim &#150 this is a real stiff one. It may not comprehensively beat the Porsche on a back road or the Cooper S through the slalom but it gets close to both and gives up less comfort. Another compromise to comfort at the cost of driving pleasure? Is this a BMW we&#146re talking about?

Yes it is. And rather a good one at that.



Refinement  
Wind noise is well suppressed, engines are quiet, seats supportive and wind deflectors are good enough to protect the quoif &#150 that&#146s good enough for me.The 2.5 and 3.0 engines which power the Z4 are superbly refined, with an appealing snarl under hard acceleration. There&#146s a little wind noise with the roof up, but it&#146s not a problem, and wind deflectors prevent too much disturbance with it down. 

Ownership 


Buying & owning

Okay this is a heart over head proposition, The Z4 costs more than the Z3 it replaces &#150 but then it is a quantum leap over what was a ultimately a toy for LA Poodle stylists. The 6 cyl engines aren&#146t cheap to service, the tires are fat and prone to spinning (another Anna Nicole &#145joke&#146 comes to mind but I will resist, I will resist) so that&#146s going to cost a fortune and lastly there are a few on the road so the residuals aren&#146t going to match your Porsche, Mercedes or perhaps even your Hondas.

That said &#150 car purchases should be anything other than rational and this owner is happy right now.
 

Quality & reliability  


The Z4 also has a glass rear roof &#150 one that I can see through. Something I can demist. Something that won&#146t annoy the hell out of me (a la Z8 plastic rear view). The cabin is well built if more somber than I&#146d have liked, with good quality materials, plenty of brushed aluminum and nary a hint at a creak, groan or rattle I&#146m fully expecting it to outlast or need to change, change and change again.

Driving position is good, controls are laid out logically and there&#146s a nice &#145thunk&#146 to the doors.

Safety & security  

Alphabet brakes, electronic everything, four airbags (that I&#146ve counted), shiny metal hoops preventing headaches should you roll, good active safety (visibility, handling) and BMW solidity all bode well for safety. It&#146s a soft top though, so leaving valuables on the front seat isn&#146t such a great idea &#150 that roof is easily cut through and not (I imagine) inexpensive to replace.


Space & practicality  

Plenty of room for two &#150 no space for anyone else. Chaka might find width a little tight &#150 especially as the door handles are prominent (especially passenger side). The truck is small but adequate for the weekend &#150 so long as the weekend is a stay at a spa rather than the supermarket run and a trip to Home Depot.

Equipment  

In the words of Dana &#150 &#145all kinds of everything&#146 &#150 you want a gadget it&#146s here. The roof moves quickly and sexily, the air-con blasts, the radio is a model of sonic precision. CD is single slot only and I&#146ve found no easy connection for my I-Pod yet but I&#146m assured that it&#146s an easy connection. The sports wheel moves in every direction, as do the seats, traction and stability control can be taken off &#150 meaning that you can get in touch with your inner driver after all, All good


Economy 

To date I&#146ve been getting about 33mpg &#150 though it has to be said that the driving has been gentle (an average speed of 48mph). I expect this to fall as the miles rise and I find my foot getting a little heavier


Cost to own

Servicing times vary &#150 but 16,000 miles is showing right now. Depreciation isn&#146t too steep and insurance is better than it would have been for competitors. Not sure about finance (we traded) but the deals everywhere make me think that it would be attractive. Bargain on 80cents a mile and I don&#146t think you&#146ll be too far off

Summary

A step down that feels like a step up &#150 and a car butch enough for two femmes to feel at home. Will get back to you on how things are going as the miles mount.
