            The Suburban can be the right car for you, but it depends on your needs.  The Suburban is a great car for off-roading, camping and for long road trips when you want a large amount of personal space, or need to fit many people into the vehicle.  The Suburban comes equipped with four wheel drive and handles nicely for a large car.  I have taken my Suburban through mud, snow, rain and hale and the car has never had a problem dealing with the extreme weather.  
The car is not good for regular city driving.  Though it is safe for the people in the car, it inflicts lots of damage onto whoever you crash into.  The Suburban is very long and hard to find a parking space on busy streets.  The Suburban is also so tall that it does not fit in many enclosed parking structures.  The gas mileage is horrible and the gas bills each month are very large.  
Depending on what type of activities you plan on doing the Suburban might or might not be the car for you.<br><br>
