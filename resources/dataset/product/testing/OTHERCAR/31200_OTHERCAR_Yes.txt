            &quot;You either hate it or you love it&quot; is the popular consensus when it comes to Saab design and driving.  Well, it's still true.  

This review will only focus on the &quot;New Generation&quot; 900's, dating from 1994 to present.  Although Saab has renamed the 900 to 9-3 from 1998 on, the car is still basically the same in design.  You can tell the new generation 900's from the pre-1994 models easily by the more aero-dynamic design of the new generation.  Pre-1994 models were often criticized by the &quot;you either hate it&quot; half because of its boxy and angular look (the photo above is pre-1994).  Although some would say that the new generation 900s had become more &quot;common&quot; in its design it is still unique among its competitors (Audi A4, BMW 3-class, MB C-class). The 900 models are probably the few true hatchbacks left in the market today.  The 900 model is split into two types, the 900s and the 900se.  The 900s is the basic model, with a 4-cylinder 2.3 liter engine.  The SE, on the other hand, comes with a 4-cylinder 2.0 liter turbo and more standard options like automatic climate control, rear spoilers, all-power seats, etc...

Below is a list compiled from 3 months of driving a 5-speed 1997 900s:

Pros:
1) Looks great.
2) Great for long trips.  Seats are comfortable and supportive.   
3) Great stereo sound.  
4) SID - System Information Device is a all-purpose display for the radio, outside temperature, mileage remaining on the gas tank, and average gas consumption (I'm averaging 24 miles/gallon).
5) For long night trips, there is a unique blackout panel that turns off all lights on the dashboard except for the speedometer.  This helps the driver to focus on the road.
6) Day-time running lights.  Actually, good and bad - it's a great safety device but you'll have to remember to turn off the lights when borrowing someone else's car.
7) Great climate control.  Whether it's air conditioner or heater, the climate control will not leave your passengers complaining about the temperature very long.
8) Good handling. The standard 15&quot; tires for a narrow car hugs the road without much leaning.
9) Good engine.  The 4-cylinder 2.3 liter engines purrs except (see cons #5 below).
10) Room, room, room.  The hatchback has enough space for luggages for everyone in the car.  

Cons:
1) Manual transmission a bit rough at low gears.
2) CD Changer option limited to only 6-disc Clarion CDC635 (hard to find in stores, but available through online - Crutchfield, Netmarket, etc).  It's easy to install and hooks right up to the factory radio.
3) Power window switch - located at center console.  The driver and front passenger have to awkwardly reach behind to get to.  This design is especially irritating when coming out of a toll booth, since the driver has to either close the window first or finish shifting the gears with the windows down.
4) Like power window, the cup holder is located at an awkward area, behind the power window switch.
5) Engine at 5th gear.  Although the basic engine is great for long drives, it is not particularly responsive if you want to overtake another car on the freeway.  You might want to opt for a turbo version if you have the need for speed.
