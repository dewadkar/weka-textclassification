            I purchased my 1992 Jetta Turbo Diesel for several reasons.  First of all, it was a trendy looking compact car without the sky high price tag.  A big selling point was also the fuel economy of a diesel engine.

Since purchasing this vehicle, I have had nothing but trouble with it.  When purchasing a Volkswagen, I would recommend that prospective buyers consider the extremely high cost of maintaining and repairing these automobiles.  Some examples are as follows:

1) Complete brake job - $1200.
2) Burning oil at a rate of approximately 250 mL per 140 km.  The cause of this was that the rings and seals in the diesel engine were worn out.  The approximate cost of repair - $1200.
3) Voltage regulator ($80) and alternator ($350)
4) Various other repairs - thermostat, alternator belt, gauges, headlights, loose molding, emergency brake, etc.  Several other small things that I can't remember went wrong with this car.  Repairs totaled approximately $1000 on these small extras.

This car has been one long headache.  Between the extensive repair costs and worrying whether or not it will leave me stranded on the side of the road (which it did a couple of weeks ago - in the middle of nowhere I might add), I sincerely regret this purchase.

While the interior heating system works well, the air conditioning leaves something to be desired.  The AC itself works fine, but in the summer it tends to overheat the engine.  It is usually within limits on the highway (except in extreme heat), but overheats the engine every time in city traffic, even in moderate heat.

All in all, I have spent around $4000 on repairs on my 1992 Jetta Turbo Diesel and I have had the pleasure of owning this wonderful car for only 6 months so far.
