            I've been using the HP Photosmart 215 for approximately two weeks now.  I'm a complete digital photography novice, but have always been interested in possibly exploring experimental photography further.  Problem is... film and processing is expensive.  Thus digital photography is the solution.  You can snap to your heart's content... well, at least until the batteries die or memory fills.  Then you just pop in new batteries and memory or download your photos to a laptop... and you're good to go.

Camera:  It was so easy to figure out.  I almost didn't need the user's guide - almost.  I would suggest reading it to understand all of the features of this camera.

Batteries:  As indicated in other posts, alkaline battery life is ridiculously short - after approximately 36 pictures they're landfill.  I purchased 8 Panasonic AA rechargeable NiMH batteries.  I use 4 while the other 4 are charging.  And these batteries last!  At least 3-4x longer than the alkaline batteries.  The user manual does caution against using rechargeable batteries, but in my opinion the manufacturer is probably concerned about using NiCAD batteries.  If the reader is concerned then perhaps another camera that can use rechargeable batteries or has more reasonable battery life would be a better choice.  For the price of the camera and based on the experiences of other Epinion-ites, I personally think that using NiMH batteries is an acceptable risk. 

Memory:  Because I'm currently not interested in printing my photos on paper, I use the lowest resolution setting.  The 4 mg card that is included with the camera will hold between 36 - 50 shots.  It depends on the file size of each picture.  I've recently seen memory cards advertised in the Los Angeles area for approximately $50-$60 for a 128 mg card. 

Price:  I paid - $89... it was an open box return, but normally can be purchased at Sears for $149. (Hint: Ask about open box returned merchandise - the normal 30 day return policy applies).

Several posts have indicated that the photo quality at the lowest resolution is not satisfactory.  Admittedly, I don't know how my photos would look if I printed them, but for web use and sharing with friends electronically, I couldn't be happier. 

Take a look at some of my shots that I posted at http://www.litedgegallery.freeservers.com/

Keep in mind that all of these shots were taken at night.  The results, IMHO, incredible!!!  Also keep in mind that most of these shots were captured without flash!!  I think this alone says something about the capabilities of this camera.  

Also, if I didn't have the luxury of seeing what I was capturing in the image LCD before I snapped the photos, if I had to pay for expensive film and development, I probably never would have risked ruining film on experimental night photography at the beach.  I can't wait until my next creative experiment!
