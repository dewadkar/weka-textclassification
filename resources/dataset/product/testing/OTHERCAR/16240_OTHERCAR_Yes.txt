            The 1999 Corolla CE is--in brief--a great value.

We were looking for an inexpensive new compact car and we preferred a line of cars with a reputation for reliability. My fiancee pretty much narrowed the field to a Honda Civic and a Toyota Corolla.  We test drove both (here's a great test-driving tip: test drive comparable vehicles within a short period of time on days with SIMILAR CLIMATE AND ROAD CONDITIONS; we also drove up hills!), and found them more or less the same.

The Corolla, however, was about a thousand dollars less in price, and we felt that we gave out only a CD player (but I preferred cassette anyway).

So which Corolla to buy?  Well, the car would spend much time on the hills of San Francisco and the stop-and-go traffic of local freeways, so we definitely wanted an automatic transmission (this is supposed to cost us about 2 - 3 miles per gallon in mileage).  All the models are outwardly identical, so here's a rundown:

The VE stands for &quot;Value Edition&quot; and includes only a three-speed transmission on automatics.  The CE stands for &quot;Classic Edition&quot; and has a four-speed transmission for automatics and power locks/windows.  I wanted better gas mileage, so this was necessary for me. The LE stands for &quot;Luxury Edition&quot; and the only apparent difference with the interior, power mirrors, and cruise-control (side-impact airbags were an options).  The LE would have cost us about another $800, so we stuck with the CE.  I ended up paying $12,800 pre-tax, docs, etc.

We're very happy with it.  Gas mileage on the highways is 32 - 35 miles per gallon!  It has served us very well in the last 8,000 miles.

The Corolla seems, however, to be designed for shorter people.  My five-foot-tall fiancee fits it perfectly!  I'm 5'6&quot; and I wish that the armrests were better positioned for me and I wish the ceiling were higher.  The new Toyota Echo and Ford Focus are supposed to have been designed with taller roofs--exactly this concern.  Seats are a bit narrow, too, so forget adult three unfriendly adults in the back.  Also, the 60/40 fold-down rear seats aren't very helpful; they don't fold down well and allow very little access between the rear cab and the trunk.

The Corolla's engine also could use a bit more zip for aggressive drivers and for hill/San Francisco drivers.  That's okay with us, though; gas mileage is more important.

We're looking for another car soon, and the 2000 Corolla is near the top of the list.  It'd be something of a bummer to get two nearly identical cars (it'd be nice a get a big car for &quot;bigger&quot; tasks and have a small car for &quot;smaller&quot; tasks), but it's hard to ignore the value of the Corolla and our satisfaction with our '99.

If you are seeking an inexpensive compact car with features, the Corolla is a great choice.  Its cost and package of features are competitive with every model in its class.  I wish someone would tell me why the Civic costs so much more.<br><br>
