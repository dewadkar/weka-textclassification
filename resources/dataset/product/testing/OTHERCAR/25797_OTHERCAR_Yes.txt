            Originally, I had entered my car search looking at brands I was familiar with through experience with family and friends: Honda and Toyota. When I visited a Honda dealer's used lot, they showed me a '97 626 LX. The price was right, it had all the options I wanted, the test drive went well. So far I have not been disappointed. I've had the car for nearly a month now, and all is going well. I knew Mazda built quality cars, but I've been impressed by the capabilities of the 626. It's just about as sporty as I'd like, it handles well at high speeds, gets good mileage and has a very versatile automatic transmission. The cruise control works smoothly. The air conditioning is powerful. With 33,000 miles on it, it shows every intention of running strong for a the next few years, and seems built to last. It's fun to drive, and just about the right size for me.
It has space to seat 4 adults comfortably, and more importantly, at 6' 4&quot; I can drive it comfortably. The trunk is spacious and I haven't run into any problems fitting what I need in there.
Overall, I'd say it's a great car for people who need to get places and get there comfortably but don't need tons of extra frills. So far it's been worth every penny.

Side note:
-As far as comments regarding the transmission go, it shifts smoothly at low RPMs and hard at higher RPMs, the same way any automatic trans does. If you don't like when it shifts hard, don't floor it and don't let it get within 250 RPMs of the red line. In addition, it has been mentioned that transmission failure has a habit of occurring between 32,000 and 35,000 miles. The Mazda factory warranty covers 3 years or 36,000 miles. I'm kinda hoping my trans gives out at 35K. A brand new trans for free after 35,000 miles have been put on the car? Not a bad deal.
