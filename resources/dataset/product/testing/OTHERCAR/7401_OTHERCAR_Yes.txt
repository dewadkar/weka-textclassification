            After reading several articles and reviews of the WRX, I had to go to the dealership and drive one. After test driving it the first time, I liked it, but wasn't convinced that it was my next car.  I wasn't sure I liked the way it looked.

I then looked around at just about all the other cars in my price range (under $30,000), and discovered that I should go drive the WRX again.  When I went back to drive it a second time it looked better (the aggressive styling grows on you), and I took a better test drive that allowed me to get up to 60- then 80 mph. It doesn't take long. I was sold.

This car is blast to drive.  The whole experience is a joy. From the Momo steering wheel, to the rally-inspired seats that hold you right in place, to the sweet sound of that boxer engine humming, this mighty mouse will put a smile on your face. The AWD and tight suspension transmit every bit of that 227 horsepower directly to the road very effectively.  And to stop all that power, there are excellent brakes too.

Many reviewers have commented that the rear seat is too cramped, however, compared to other cars in the WRX's class the back seat is relatively roomy. The leg room is not terrible for a compact car. And if you have kids, don't think that you can't have this car. With AWD, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and a decent back seat with 3 safety belts, even my wife loves this car.  She owns a 2000 Outback and is considering trading it in for a WRX wagon, after I made the mistake of letting her drive mine.  

My only complaints are that they could have done more with the dashboard/gauges, and the optional 17" wheels were too expensive for me to afford. But while the interior my be unrefined, it's very functional. The standard in dash 6 CD changer is also a nice touch. 

I purchased my WRX without the spoiler because I just think it looks better. I also opted for the titanium shift knob.  Considering the amount of money I spent, and the amount of fun I'm having in this car, I'm very pleased with my purchase.
