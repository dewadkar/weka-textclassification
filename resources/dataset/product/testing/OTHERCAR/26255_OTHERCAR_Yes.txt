            The Civic Si is not for everyone.  It's not supposed to be for everyone (Accord is for everyone). If you are the kind of person who views a new car as a blank canvas, and not a finished work - the Civic Si may be for you. Honda has looked at how many people alter their cars by lowering them and adding such things as big, loud exhaust, and decided to sell a factory version of those altered cars. Basically Honda has taken a regular Civic Coupe, and made all the modifications for you (should you like that sort of thing).

The Civic Si is a good looking car.  The electric blue paint makes it stand out (less interesting colors are available) in a world full of black and white Accords and Camry's.  The Si adds a deeper air dam in the front, skirting all the way around, a little larger exhaust, and really cool looking 15 inch alloy wheels.  
 
Inside the Si the interior is somewhat sparse.  Seats are firm but supportive, knobs to the left let you adjust the seat bottom several different ways.  The seatbelts are rather difficult to reach.  The 5-speed shifter falls to hand nicely, and the leather wrapped steering wheel has a nice quality feel to it as well. Dash mounted sunroof switch is a neat alternative to the usual roof mounted switch. The stereo sounds weak and flat, there is a CD player, but a tape player is an option. Several friends of mine have upgraded to an after-market stereo, but use the stock speakers. The speakers sound great, apparently it's just the stereo that needs help.  Gauges are big, clear and easy to read.  The first thing you might notice is the tachometer.  This car has an 8000 rpm redline, in fact maximum horsepower comes on past 7000 rpm.  Incredible.

This car is really about the engine. The interior and stereo hardly matter when you consider the twin-cam, VTEC, 160 hp engine that lives under the bright blue hood of this Civic. Needless to say the engine likes to rev, it is difficult to drive slowly in this car. Thank goodness for manual transmissions, shifting your own gears in this car is a blast. Leave the car in 3rd until the redline quickly approaches, drop it into 4th, press the gas pedal (HARD!) and feel the car surge forward like there's a jet strapped to it.  You can't help but smile.  All this performance is not limited to straight lines.  Handling is excellent.  Virtually flat cornering is thanks, in part, to the lower stance and stiffer suspension.  The Si feels twitchy, but not in a bad way. It feels like a tiny race car - it is that stiff.  Wheels and tires are big enough to handle the cornering abilities without squealing. Brakes are good. Drive this car and you will win the Commuter/Freeway Gran Prix, and you'll probably win everyday.

Overall the Civic Si does just what it is suppose to do. It goes fast, corners flat, looks cool, makes you smile.  What more could you ask of a small coupe for around $17K?  

On the down side: This is not a family car - the ride is harsh, the engine is noisy, and there are not many comfort features inside.  In many ways the Civic Si is the exact opposite of the Civic EX sedan... but it's sure hard to pass up 160 hp.
