            We bought a 1999 Saturn SL2 in September of 1998, just as they were coming off the lines. Ours is navy blue. After doing extensive online searching, we planned on buying the Saturn SL2 because of it's safety features, it's size, and it's dependability, but the salesman sold us on the car. 

We like the car because it has never let us down! The steering wheel is designed like none I've seen before. That doesn't mean it's square, it's just it handles better. The driver's seat is comfortable to sit in, and you feel safe. We truly love the size, because it's not so big that you feel like you are driving a bus, yet it's big enough to haul the plywood we needed a few weeks ago.

The only thing we don't like is the backseat-it could be a little bigger. I think it would be fine even for a family of three, but if you get more than that the children will be fighting over the space.

I feel very safe driving this car. It turns with ease, even on wet pavement, and you can stop on a dime. We have the manual transmission, and it shifts with ease. In fact, I learned to drive a manual on this car and it was not hard at all.

The Saturn SL2 would be a great car for a first time driver, a college student who makes many hours-long trips home for the holidays, and a young family. Anyone with more than one or two small children should consider the Saturn SL2's larger cousin, LS.<br><br>
