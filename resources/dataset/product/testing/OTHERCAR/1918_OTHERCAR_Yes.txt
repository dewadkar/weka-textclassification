            The new 2000 Maxima combines power and performance in a snug sedan. Nissan produced its best sedan with the release of the Maxima. At around 30k with all the options the Maxima provides affordability, performance, luxury, and looks. The Maxima produces 222 hp and 217 lb of torque out of its 3.0 liter V-8 front wheel drive engine. Going 0-60 mph in an awesome 6.7 seconds it is faster than most of its rivals, including the new BMW 323. 

The Maxima is recommended for anyone who wants a performance car that provides luxury without paying a luxury car price. The SE package in the one of the best packages for the Maxima. Although, it is not the highest package (the GLE is the highest) the SE provides an optional five speed manual transmission and wing. This model also can come with a leather package that provides 45 square feet of leather. If you also take the optional performance package you can get 17&quot; rims. The Maxima is really great at handling and you can take all the corners you want at high speeds without and complaining from the car. The ride is quiet and the tires will not squeal when you push the car to the limits. 

I would not recommend this car for those who want a true sports car. Although the Maxima performs great, it cannot perform like other sports cars because of its size. The looks on the Maxima are also not up to show car requirements either. The design provides a simple look and does not have a sleek design that threatens others on the road. <br><br>
