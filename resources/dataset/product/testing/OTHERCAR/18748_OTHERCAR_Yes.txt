            For the last generation of 300ZX, when Nissan added a back seat, the name changed to 300ZX 2+2.  But, with the new 350Z sporting only two seats, Nissan insists that the Infiniti G35 Sport Coupe is NOT a 350Z 2+2.  Nissan is exactly correct.  And they are unquestionably wrong.  

Make no mistake, the Nissan 350Z and Infiniti G35 Sport Coupe are twins - but fraternal, not identical.  They share much of the same blood, but each has its own DNA.

THE SAME:

Both cars have the same wonderful engine.  With 3.5 liters of displacement, this 24 valve powerplant produces 280 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque.  The slight decrease in power and torque, seven hp and four lb-ft to be exact, from the 350Z is due to exhaust system packaging.  Both have the same quick revving character and both make the same beautiful exhaust note.  This is a car you'll enjoy driving with the window down to hear it rev.  Power is always available and abundant.  Only those used to big Detroit iron will be disappointed by the torque.  Someone once said that we buy cars for their horsepower and enjoy them for their torque.  If true - and I believe it is - the Infiniti offers both.

Both are built on the same platform.  This means that the real wheel drive Infiniti is near perfectly balanced (54/46) and fully capable of demanding driving.  It also means that it is well built with no rattles or vibrations.  However, the Infiniti version is 7.9" longer than the Nissan.  The most obvious dividend of the extra length is that rear seats can be added.  It also gives the Nissan more of a GT feel, versus the Nissan's pure sports car feel.  However, the price to be paid for more volume, is more weight - about 200 lbs. in this case.  Given that they can also share the same 6 spd manual transmission, the Infiniti accelerates to 60 mph in a few tenths more at 6.1 sec (according to Road & Track).  Trunk space is limited to only 7.8 cubic feet (two golf bags or six plastic grocery bags), but is unencumbered by the pretty, ornamental shock tower brace of the 350Z.  And the rear seat folds down, unlike the 4 door G35.

Both cars share the same suspension - with one huge exception.  Both have the same suspension parts, bushings, and springs.  However, the Infiniti has a softer shock tune.  This transforms the Infiniti into a car which can be driven every day in great comfort.

Both cars have nearly identical price tags.  Equipment levels vary, but both have starting prices below $30,000.  However, but option out around $32k to $36k.  The 900 mile old version I drove, with automatic, leather, and loaded with all but navigation system sold for about $32k in lovingly used form.  Expect to see most G35 Coupes in well optioned form until the new wears off a little.

DIFFERENT

If you must have rear seats, such as I do with a 6 year old and a 5 year old, then the Infiniti is the only option.  The rear seat is not just an after thought as in many past 2+2 cars.  The two individual seats are very comfortable with plenty of shoulder room.  However, headroom is severly restricted.  At 6' and 235 lbs, I had plenty of leg, hip, and shoulder room, but I had to hold my head over at 45ï¿½ due to the back glass.  My 5 year old soon and his car booster seat fit with plenty of room to spare.  However, because it is a two door, reaching back there to buckle a child in will get very old, very quickly.  And will likely lead to a trip to the chiropractor.  Between the seats is a small storage compartment big enough to hold a couple of Game Boys, and their are two very usable cup holders.  A couple of rear vents are included on the B pillar.  If adults must ride back there, it should be only for quick trips, such as running out to lunch and back.  However, kids will be fine and happy.

The biggest downfall of the 350Z I cited in my epinion review was the ride.  Although it gave a very agile performance, it renders the 350Z to weekend car status only.  That one change to the Infiniti's suspension - the shocks - has completely eliminated that downfall.  In fact, the Infiniti could even be called supple.  No longer is every road irregularity are sharp pain.  The G35 Coupe gives the same well controlled, flat turn in as the 350Z, but the ride is "just right".  Combined with the longer wheel base, the G35 is more stable and begs for the long sweepers.  This is a car designed to attack on-ramps!  Don't think it's lost the ability to fast dance though:  in Road & Track's tests, it beat the 350Z in the slalom and skidpad at 0.91g.  For those of you not up on the numbers, 0.91g is world-class performance up with the best from Germany and Italy!  The same can be said of the slalom time!

The automatic, with Tiptronic-type sport shifting, is the base transmission.  The 6 spd manual is available as an option, but comes with a list of other changes, including Brembo brakes and 18" wheels.  The 6 spd 350Z I drove was very notchy, but I suspect is was specific to the car I drove as I have heard no other complaints at all.  In any case, shifts were very short.

Whereas the Nissan interior is spartan and business only.  The G35 Coupe interior is more fitting of the Infiniti badge.  Styling is more thorough, without being gimicky, as is now so common with many European and Japanese cars.  Controls have a solid, Japanese feel to them.  However, some of the console plastics have a lower-than-expected feel to them.  The version I drove had an in-dash 6 CD changer with cassette.  Despite its Bose badge (something Nissan and Infiniti love) the sound was quite good.  It also had heated seats, automatically dimming rear view mirror, built in garage door control, wiring for satellite radio, electric seats, sunroof, steering wheel controls for cruise and radio, and a clever display area at the top of the center console for compass, separate interior temperature settings, and outside temperature.  For those who like gadgets, a navigation system is also available.  The analog clock in the center of the dash is stylish, but I'd prefer digital for quick checks.

Outside, the G35 Coupe is a much prettier and elegant package than its Nissan brother.  Although obviously related to the 350Z, the Infiniti is more flowing.  Some have disliked the back end, but I find it to be very attractive, with the rear 3/4 view the best way to view it.  Personally, I would have softened the crease between the hood and front fenders, but they didn't ask, and I can live with it.  The front is also more attractive with the Infinit grill.  The taillights are an Infiniti tell tale, which is to say they are very attractive and much more enduring than the 350Z's triangle forms.  This car is understated enough to not scream out in a crowd.  But once noticed, it will hold and please the observer.  It has the look of a modest, athlete with enormous ability, but little mouth.

The Infiniti G35 Sports Coupe is only offered and service by, surprise, Infiniti dealerships.  Depending on your proximity to a major metropolitan area, you may or may not have an Infiniti dealership close by.  This could leave you with a tremendous inconvenience when it's time for service.  Something to keep in mind, especially if you're buying used.

DRIVING IMPRESSIONS

This car is a blast to drive!  Nissan/Infiniti has a winner of an engine (which is why they use it so extensively now).  The G35 Coupe loves to rev, and rev quickly.  Power is always available and acceleration is very quick.  You will not notice the couple of tenths of a second lost to the 350Z.  In both cars, I accidently touched 90 mph coming off the on-ramp.  And this in the automatic equipped version I drove.  The exhaust sound was a beautiful baritone without being obtrusive.

Handling feels very confident.  The G35 Coupe sticks like glue, takes a firm set and then just keeps holding on.  It is not nervous or twitchy like it 350Z brother.  Quick maneuvers are also handled well.  In and out of traffic is effortless.  

The ride was surprisingly smooth.  I could easily drive this car for hours at a stretch.  It would also make a very satisfying daily driver.  And at 25 mpg on the highway its even practical.

The interior is intimate, but not snug.  All controls are close at hand and ergonomics are pretty good, with the exception of some radio controls.  Why can't we have a radio with knobs that turn for volume?  Why does the radio now have to be an integral part of the entire dash assembly?  Why don't they ask me???  But I digress...  The leather interior was very comfortable and easy on the eyes.  However, front seat headroom could have been better.  My sparse hair brushed the ceiling and I'm not sure if I could wear a cap.  The instrument cluster tilts with the wheel, so it's always where it should be.  Creature comforts are plentiful.  There are three power outlets in the front!?!?  When the front seats are tilted forward to allow rear seat access, they move electrically.  Slowly.  But, they do return to their previous location which is nice.  As long as it isn't raining while you wait.

I loved the Infiniti G35 Sports Coupe.  So much so, I plan to buy one!  I'll be holding out for a 6 spd version though.  Nothing else, with the possible exception of the BMW 330, offers such incredible performance and livability.  And BMW can't touch the $35,000-ish price of a loaded G35 Coupe.  (Looks like the Germans learned NOTHING from the Acura/Lexus/Infiniti appearance a little over a decade ago!)

If you're thinking about a Nissan 350Z, you should at least look at the Infiniti G35 Coupe.  You will find many of the things that drew you to the Nissan, but you may find that this quieter twin, is also the one more likely to excel.
