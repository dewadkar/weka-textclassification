            After test driving several vehicles in the class, I settled on the Maxima.  A very luxurious car.  Has a very responsive engine and corners well.  Lots of room for five people.  Has a great Bose stereo.  I'm on about 14,000 miles now, and there have been very few complaints.  I think the one thing that does bother me a little about the car is that, at times, I have a little trouble getting the visor to come down.  I'm also used to driving trucks and SUVs that have bigger cup holders.  But aside from that, I'm all smiles about the car. I think it'd be a great car for almost anyone, from students to the elderly. <br><br>
