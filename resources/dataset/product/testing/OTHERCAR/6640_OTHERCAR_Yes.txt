            I bought the Jetta (2001 Wolfsburg, 1.8T) because I was looking for a sporty car for under $20K. I considered the Mazda Protege5 as well, but it didn't have enough power for me. The Jetta's turbo engine isn't great off the line, but once the turbo has spooled up (around 2000 rpm or so) it gets moving. Other performance qualities (brakes, handling) are also up to the task. I wish there were sportier, more stylish cars in this price range, but there just aren't and the Jetta seemed like the best compromise.

The Wolfsburg package (turbo engine, sport seats, BBS alloy wheels, sport suspension, sport steering wheel) is a great bargain and I would encourage prospective owners to ask about future availability with the new 2002 model.

Build quality seems very good (under 4K miles on mine), with the exception of minor interior rattles on rough roads.

The interior, while it certainly looks great, is lacking ergonomical design considerations. The seats lack lumbar support and the stereo and HVAC controls are mounted too low. The stereo (premium sound comes with the Wolfsburg package, too) sounds great, but it's very difficult to operate the buttons without looking at the stereo.

Overall, the Jetta is quick, nimble, cooler than a Honda and with free service for 24 months I'm not terribly concerned about my minor complaints.
