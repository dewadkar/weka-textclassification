            I purchased my 2000 Bonneville SSEi in January. I decided to hold of any epinions so that I have thoroughly done a real life test of the car and its features. This car is also a follow on to my previous 89 Bonneville SSE. For this purchase I had narrowed it down between the Lincoln LS and the Bonneville. 

First off I purchased a loaded black model with the pewter leather. The styling is subjective but 'I like it'. It also does one thing a car like this is supposed to do, get looks! There are not many and the subtle styling gets people looking at it to figure out what it is. I also love driving by Grand Prix owners, the Bonneville takes a lot of that car and makes it better.

Features that I really like. Simply stated all of them. I really like the driver identity and customizations. I am a computer geek and love 'programming' the car for me. My wife on the other hand doesn't get that jazzed. However me being 6'4 and her 5'2 makes the automatic seat adjustment based on our keyless entry units nice. Neither of us have the customary adjustments of seats, mirrors, radios etc. prior to even shifting into gear. 

The dash is the same dash that I came to love in my 89. Lots of it but very functionally laid out. The only button that is awkward is the cruise control but with a supercharged V6 who needs cruise control. If Pontiac had to make compromises they made the right ones. The driver information is way cool, switching from miles to kilometres in an instant plus providing feedback on tire pressure, oil life and levels and many more items.

I use the car to cruise on the weekends and also as part of my daily commute, it is a pleasure in both roles. It is my first black car, I love the sexy look but I also understand all the warnings now about owning black. To do the car justice you feel very obliged to keep it clean at all times and I am one who doesn't use commercial car washes.

This vehicle is for performance enthusiasts looking for that high tech luxury feel with 4 doors. The engine/transmission operate on par with the European class machines and this car keeps up to the best of them on the open road. I keep surprising fellow drivers and myself when I stomp on this car. I think anyone looking in this price range would be hard pressed to find a better value. The Lincoln I was evaluating just didn't stack up price value wise, in my opinion.<br><br>
