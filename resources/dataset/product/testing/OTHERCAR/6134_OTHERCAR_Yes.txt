            I bought this vehicle because I have owned Chevys for quite some time now
even though in the past I have owned lemons. I currently own a 98 Venture
and now this 2000 Impala. So far so good. I have an advantage in that my
family are GM mechanics and know these cars well. I did alot of research
on different cars and decided on the bigger the better since I am over 6
feet tall and weigh 270. I needed leg room and at the same time wanted
decent gas mileage. This car appealed to me and it gets good gas mileage
for a large car. The ride is smooth, but I think another different brand
of tire would make it smoother. It can be hard for shorter drivers to see
out the back window since the rear end sits up and I noticed that blind
spot mirrors help with left and right views. I drove lots of cars and the
LS rode the best for me. It is smooth on the highway and absorbs bumps
nicely, but there is noise of coarse pavement and I think this is where
a better set of tires would do the best. I think people looking for a
large car with a smooth ride with lots of bells and whistles should con-
sider this car. From what I have read this is one of the best cars that
GM has built in a long time and time will tell, since I buy cars to keep
for at least 10 years.
