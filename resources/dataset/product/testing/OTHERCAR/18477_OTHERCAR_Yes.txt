            I bought a new 2004 Grand Am SE to replace my 1997 Nissan Sentra GXE.  When I finally traded my Sentra in, it had 214,571 miles on the clock.  I put on almost 200K of them.  In comparisons based on looks alone, there simply is no comparison.  The Grand Am looks 100,000 times better than the Sentra ever did.  I like the cleaner lines on the 03-04 Grand Am, without all of that extra body cladding.  It resembles an Alero from the side now.  It's a good look.  Mine is black with dark pewter interior.  The only problem I have with the black is I have to wash it all the time, and its starting to get cold here in Ohio.  It looks really good after a carwash, though, so it's worth freezing myself in the driveway a couple of times a week, so far, anyway...  It's got a lot of standard features, yet the important ones aren't standard.  I like the fact that fog lights are standard, and power locks, air conditioning.  However, I didn't notice until I was driving home from the dealership that cruise control was not included.  I'm getting used to it, but I drive a lot, and cruise would have been a definite deal breaker, had I known the car didn't have it.  I just thought it was standard on everything these days.  On the inside, the seats are very comfortable, even on longer trips, and the red backlights look good, and are pretty easy on the eyes.  I got mine with a 5 speed manual getrag tranny.  This shifter is hands down, the best shifter  I have ever used.  Grand Ams are quite rare with five speeds, though, so if you want one, you'll have to look around a lot, or factory order one.  Mine was the only one within a 200 mile radius of my house.  It was worth it, though.  It's got a 2.2 liter ecotech 4 cylinder engine with 140 HP.  It's obviously not the fastest car on the road, but coupled with the tranny, it gets up and goes pretty quickly.  On top of that, it gets 37 MPG, supposedly.  I've never measured.
