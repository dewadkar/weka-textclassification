            I bought my 1999 black Jeep Wrangler so I could have a nice car for college.  A Jeep Wrangler is a perfect college SUV.  It has enough room like a SUV yet it drives like a car.  It has a short wheel base for easy turning.  It has a 4 Liter V-6 engine which gives it plenty of power.  It sits high off the ground which allows the driver to easily see the road.  It is a great road vehicle as well as an offroad vehicle.  It is a little harsh with bumps, but it can handle them.  All Jeep Wranglers have 4 wheel drive to make offroading easier.  It is also a very fun truck to drive.  The soft top can be easily removed for driving along the beach.  Jeeps are fun for all people unless you want a LOT of space.  Wranglers also have a lot of wind noise.  If you enjoy quiet rides, Wrangler's are NOT for you.  I have enjoyed my Jeep, and I encourage all the readers to consider a Wrangler as their next purchase.  <br><br>
