            My husband and I have four children so obviously we had to go big.  We looked at several other models before we stumbled across the villager.  What struck me the most about it was the 'sportiness' of it.  The interior is very sleek. We went with a leather interior and a two tone exterior which I think makes it look more sport utility. Also we wanted something roomy on the inside but not so long that I could not back it out of a parking space!  The villager was everything we wanted in a van.  If you have a family but do not want a typical family van trust me the Mercury Villager is the one for you.<br><br>
