            When I was 18, I was lucky to purchase a brand new vehicle for a graduation present.  We purchased a 1995 Chrysler Convertible, brand new, right off the truck.  This car was absolutely beautiful.  It was a special addition, white with gold trim, gorgeous.  Wherever I drove, people would stare, I constantly was complimented.  The car itself was a disaster.  The top leaked when it rained (which shorted out the electrical system), the transmission dropped at 55,000 miles-after that the car was never safe to drive.  The top would sometimes get stuck when it was down, we would have to manually put it up.  The radio shorted out in the first 6 months.  The car was a nightmare.  Chrysler was no help, they would deny any allegations about the car (when we went in to get the top checked they used a hose to make the top wet, they didn't use enough water for it to even reach the side), when the transmission kept dropping they said the car had too many miles on it to do anything about it.  We finally got rid of it by selling it back to the dealer.  I would never, ever purchase another Chrysler.<br><br>
