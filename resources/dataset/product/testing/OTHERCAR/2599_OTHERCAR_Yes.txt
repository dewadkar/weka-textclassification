            Well, my husband bought a 1999 Nissan Maxima much to my dismay.  For me it had a few things going against it at first, it was a 5-speed, it was red and I thought it was ugly because of the way the trunk seems kind of low.  But I must say that I am truly impressed with this car.  

It has overcome all of the &quot;problems&quot; that I thought it had and now I am a firm Maxima believer.  First it is very quick and responsive.  It is so quiet that sometimes I think I might have stalled the engine.  The seat comfort is superb.  The sound system is great, it has a cd player and tape player.  It is the easiest five speed that I have ever driven, just a smooth shifting machine.  Everything seems to be located just where you need it.  The only thing I have trouble with is sometimes accidently turning on the seat heaters when I put a drink in the cupholder.  As for the color and trunk, they have grown on me. 

I would have never wanted a Nissan Maxima before, but now I have even considered owning a second one for myself.<br><br>
