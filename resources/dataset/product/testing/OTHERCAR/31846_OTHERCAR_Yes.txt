            	The 2000 Volkswagen Passat 4Motion was way more then I dreamed of! The price starts at just 26,525 for the GLS Sedan, Bargain the car comes standard with just about everything. I don't just like it because of it's cool features, but because how it looks. It was redesigned in 1998, then changes were made in 1999.

	What all models it comes with: All models come standard with Volkswagens 4Motion 4WD system and a new 5-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. 2000 models include a multi-function trip computer, a full-size extra tire, and a Monsoon sound system with a 6-disc CD changer. If that is not enough the GLX model has(extra) an in-dash single CD player, automatic day/night rear view mirror, alloy wheels, automatic climate control, interior wood trim and leather bucket power seats. That should be enough.

	Be very careful when driving because believe me it does not feel like you are going 60 miles per hour. I thought I was going 60 in my new car, but I was going 77mph. Also the new Passat's get about 18-29 mpg. The inside is organized in a nice way. All the new Passat's have a 6 Cylinder, 2.8 Liter, 190 Horsepower Engine. Price: GLS Sedan 26,525/GLX Sedan 30,380/ GLS Wagon 27,352 GLX Wagon 31,180. THE BEST VALUE!!!!!!
