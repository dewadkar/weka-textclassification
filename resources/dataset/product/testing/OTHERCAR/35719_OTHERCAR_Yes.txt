            First a little context for my review�  Over the last 22 years, I have owned 5 BMWs.   My first was an eight year old 1969 1600i (the little brother of the 2002).  I spent all summer rebuilding it and getting it ready for college.  Unfortunately, I wrecked it on the way to school.  

2 years later (in 1981), my second BMW was a 1975 2002 that I also totally restored.  It was this car that gave me a full appreciation for the solid BMW engineering.  After 90,000 very hard miles, I was ready for my first new BMW.  

It was a 1987 528i.  My first new car buying experience was a total disappointment.  I got badly taken by an unscrupulous salesman at Stevens Creek BMW on the purchase price for the car.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed  the car itself for the first 2 years.  After about 35,000 miles it began to show it's age prematurely and required excessive trips to the shop where I was gouged for basic services.

In an effort to avoid a total bath on the depreciation of the 528i, I sold it and bought a new 1989 Acura Legend.  The Legend was possibly the best car I have ever owned.

I finally came back to BMW because I fell in love with a brand new 1997 midnite blue 740iL with a tan interior.  The styling was finally acceptable (early 1990s 7-series are big fat beasts in my opinion).  The new 4.4 liter engine was beefy enough, and headroom was adequate for the first time in many years (I am 6'4&quot; mostly torso).  I bought it because I wanted a 4 door luxury car that had lots of room and performance.  Closest competition is the S-class Mercedes (too stodgy for my tastes in 1998 although the new s-class body is HOT!).

Overall, I love the car itself.  It has a few minor issues that I'll detail below.  Unfortunately, I am reluctant to recommend the 740iL or any BMW.  My reservations are largely due to BMWs success in the last few years.  Their success has resulted in a major downward slide in the availability and quality of services available through their dealerships (especially in Northern California). Further compounding the problem, BMW will not allow 3rd parties to perform service under the 7-series maintenance program, thus preventing owners from shopping around for better service.

To illustrate my point, I recently tried to make an appointment for regular maintenance on the 740iL.  I was quoted a 5 week wait if I could provide my own transportation and 7 weeks if I needed a loaner.  By the way, the &quot;loaners&quot; are usually the  typical American made rental cars from the local agency, because the dealers don't stock enough BMWs to fill the demand.  Expect to wait 45 minutes while they get you in and out of the shop...

The same horrible availability is typical when trying to get the car in for needed warranty repairs.  I recently had minor problems with the phone, and windshield washer system.  I was told that since these items were not &quot;safety&quot; issues, I was subject to the 5-7 week waiting periods�  At $900 plus gas a month to own this car, I expect to have it operational under warranty in reasonable timeframes.  This is a major problem for BMW

The car is a dream to drive.  It has great handling for a big car and good power for it's weight.  Visibility is very good.  Interior cabin noise is minimal, as long as the windows are all fully closed (see more below).  I have almost 40,000 miles and it has been very reliable.  The &quot;user interfaces&quot; throughout are excellent.  The steering wheel mounted controls are wonderful (stereo/phone).  The trunk is cavernous.  Overall passenger room is incredible (although some have complained about the seat recline in the rear making it difficult to ride long distances).

For the gadget freaks, it has tons and they are mostly great.  I love the parking distance control (a must), and the integrated GPS system.  The (premium) stereo is more than adequate (trunk mounted CD changer should be moved to the dash in lieu of the tape), and the onboard computer is quite useful (despite sorely lacking integration with the GPS system).  On the downside, the phone is overpriced and cumbersome to use.  It's already completely obsolete (analog) and can't be upgraded (DOH!!!).  BMW should implement a system that allows major brand handheld cellular phone (Nokia, Sony, Motorola) to &quot;dock&quot; into the car for hands-free etc�  The keyless entry is fabulous, but the locks are very annoying to use from inside the car...

Apparently, due to efforts to reduce noise, the car does not breathe very well in the interior.  Ventilation is very poor through the heating/AC system which is more noisy than expected when fully engaged.  A very annoying &quot;reverberation&quot; is created when rear windows are opened for ventilation at any speed above 30mph.  It is virtually impossible to drive the car with the rear windows down above 35mph due to this phenomenon.

I could go on for several pages...  If you're interested in more info, send me email...

ps:  You can read a slightly different perspective on the same car by reading an epinion on the 7-series written by my fiance'.  Search for &quot;Cholten&quot;<br><br>
