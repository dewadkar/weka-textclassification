            I purchased this car in August of 2000 and I have not had a problem with the car.  Before this car I had a 1994 Mercury Sable in where I had a bad accident ($8000 damage) in which the insurance company had fixed.  The car still ran like a dream.  I did not have to do much repairs to the vehicle, maintenance like oil changes, brakes, one set of tires (needed another when I got rid of it at 94K) but I felt I needed a new car because I do a lot of driving (back and forth to work and personal).  I decided to purchase the 2000 Mercury Sable because of the satisfaction I had gotten from the pervious one.  The car is very comfortable and I've been getting 22 MPG city driving and close to 30 MPG highway.  Just took it to Maryland from New Jersey from the weekend and I feel that this car is better than the last.

What I love about this vehicle is that the price was very reasonable ($20K) for all of the options that I got (ABS, power moon roof, leather seats, 200 HP engine, and many more).  What I hate about the vehicle is that since this was the LS Premiums edition it would have been nice if they could have put in a CD player.  It would have cost another $575 to have a 6-disc changer installed but I opted to get it elsewhere (through a friend that works for Ford) for cheaper.

To drive this vehicle has been very good, you don't need oil changes now until every 5,000 miles instead of 3,000 and the ride has been smooth, quiet and it has a lot of pep with the larger Duratec 200 HP engine.

The person who should buy this vehicle is someone who is looking for a sort-of luxury car without spending all the money of a luxury car.  When I compared this to the Mazda Millenium (Special Edition) that a friend bought at work I felt that based on the options that she got and I got, I got the better deal for $6000 less.  The person who shouldn't buy this vehicle is someone who will always have a passenger in the back seat.  It is roomy but when you have someone in the front that is larger and needs more room, it takes away from the back.  Also someone with children may not want to purchase because of the leather seats but they do offer the GS edition with cloth in the Sable.<br><br>
