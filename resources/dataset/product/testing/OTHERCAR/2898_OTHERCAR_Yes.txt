<TEXT>
            I found myself in the marketplace for a new car, thanks to a Houston driver who I guess didn't believe in the fact that the yellow light means STOP! Anyways my '96 jetta (please read my review - <a href="/content_77070503556">http://www.epinions.com/content_77070503556</a>) got totalled and I was looking to buy a new car. After the preliminary test drives, I was left with making a decision between a 2002 VW Jetta (1.8T GLS with sport package) and 2002 Acura RSX (Base model). I finally went with the Acura but if you are married/or with kids and still want a fun ride the Jetta probably makes more sense. 

<b>EXTERIOR:7</b>
The exterior atleast the front is given the generic Acura treatment. The rear got some flak from some of the automotive magazines, but personally I think it looks nice.
An interesting touch is that the glass exterior for the back of the hatch has a dark covering so that you cannot see from the outside what is inside the trunk.I dont like the pop up handles on the Acuras, they need to switch to the grab handles which are there in almost all the other cars nowadays

<b>INTERIOR:9
EXCELLENT</b> The car feels much more expensive than it is. I went for a tan colored interior with titanium gauges. The whole interior glows neon-orange at night - a concept borrowed from VW/Audi. The small leather wrapped steering wheel is a nice touch.The big, round buttons and the automatic climate control(can you believe that in a car under 20K?!) are very easy to use without taking your eyes off the road.But my favorite feature is the "sport" seats. These are an absolute drivers delight.They have unbelievable amount of side and shoulder bolstering that keep you firmly ensconced to your seats in the twisties. Leather is available as an option for an extra 1000$ but I think the leather felt too "cheapo" for that price.  The OEM stereo (Alpine) is OK, good enough for me but if you are an audiophile you will definitely want to upgrade.
The center console has a storage bin which if you open it one way can store quarters and other knickknacks and if you slide it the other way - it has two cupholders.( Kudos to Honda's ergonomics department!) The rear seats are not as bad as they look, although they are cramped , adults can still sit in the rear albeit for short duration. The trunk is pretty spacious, but fold the back seats down and it is almost cavernous. I was able to load an IKEA bed frame (not the bed itself!) onto the back.

<b>ENGINE & TRANSMISSION: 8</b>
The RSX base model comes with Acura's new 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engine that makes 160 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 141 pound-feet of torque at 4,000. It is no "speed king" but enough to catch up with the people who rev the engines at traffic lights with their "souped up " Civics. The stick shift is a joy to operate. I have never felt myself searching for the gears right from the test drive. The shifter is precise unlike the rubbery feel of my old jetta and the clutch has minimal play for quick launches. The mileage is pretty decent- varies from 27-31mpg and you do not need premium fuel!

<b>RIDE QUALITY & ROAD NOISE: 6 </b>
I am sure if you are looking for a Lexus like plush ride you wouldn't be even reading this review. But be prepared to feel every bump and pothole on the road. Road noise is much lesser than in the Integra, but still on the higher side. (Anyways you can reduce road noise by increasing the volume on the stereo :-) )

<b>HANDLING:8</b>
The handling is probably the best aspect of the RSX (atleast in my opinion). Very neutral handling and minimal body roll. The only problem I have noticed  is that if you are taking turns on roads with lot of undulations, then the rear end bobs a bit, but this happens only when you drive the car very hard. The stock Michelin Pilots are OK, they start squealing much before you hit the limits of the car. I am just waiting for the first 30K miles or so before I can replace the tires with something better.

<b>VALUE:7</b>
The RSX base model comes standard with power windows,locks, remote keyless entry, power moonroof, CD player,4 wheel ABS, climate control ... pretty much the works. Traction control is not available. Leather is an option although I wouldnt recommend it.The price is slightly on the higher side if you compare it to -say a Hyundai Tiburon, but I think the level of refinement on the Acura is probably worth the extra money.

<b>FINAL THOUGHTS</b>
There are probably better cars on the market which are more sporty but not practical enough as a daily driver and vice versa. The RSX seems to hit the middle ground effectively. It's car you can drive to work and still put it through it's paces on the weekend and have a wide grin all over your face.


********UPDATE************************
clocked about 7500 miles in 4.5 months. No problems till now! touch wood..
If you are in Houston I highly recommend John Eagle Acura, the sales process was very smooth, no questions asked test drive and I took a really long one at that, as little hassle I have experienced while negotiating and great service after the sale too.

********OCTOBER 2003 UPDATE********************
Boo-hoo :-( my RSX got totalled because a moron in Bastrop TX didnt believe in stopping her truck for stop signs. Head on collision at 60 mph for me and a side collision for the truck. Me and fiance (luckily) were able to walk out of the accident with no broken bones (touch wood!). Crumple zones really work.. the front took all the impact... back to car shopping..
