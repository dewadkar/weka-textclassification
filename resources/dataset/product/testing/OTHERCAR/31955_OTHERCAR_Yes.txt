            Please note: I originally posted the wrong horsepower number.  It is 260, not 240.  Sorry!

Although the Impala Super Sport (SS) is based upon the Caprice, Chevy has performed so many modifications that nobody will associate it with this ill-conceived, full-sized beached wale.  For starters, the suspension has been stiffened, and the car has been lowered, which provides aggressive handling and cornering.  It's unbelievable for such a large car.  Moreover, the exterior underwent several cosmetic changes that make the Impala SS the most intimidating car on the road.  Most importantly, Chevy dropped a 260 horsepower version of the LT-1 engine (the Corvette's 5.7L, V-8 power plant) into the Impala.  With its powerful engine and rear wheel drive design, the Impala SS rockets to 60 mph in 7.1 seconds.  

	I recently took a 450 mile road trip in the Impala and realized what a great place it is to spend a couple of hours.  The seats are very wide, comfortable, and supportive.  A cavernous trunk has enough room for a month's luggage, and the backseat could sit four people if there were enough seatbelts.  Periodic adjustments of the arctic-style air conditioner were easy as the sun started to set.  The same was true for finding another radio program as the familiar local stations began to fade.  The only minor annoyance was that the digital speedometer was difficult to read at times because of the sun.

	Even though the car is RWD, it behaves decently in the rain and snow because of its heavy weight, but it is still not for those who need to deal with these conditions of a regular basis.  The price tag is hefty for a used car; most go for around 20k.  However, there is no other car on the full-sized market (new or used) that has a Corvette's soul.  

	One final word: please do not confuse the used Impala SS (1994-1996 model years) with the new Impalas, which do not live up to the image of this great car.
