            The time had come for me to look on the market for a car. As a first time buyer, even thou I did tons of research as to which cars were good and which weren&#146t, I was still at a lost as to what to look for.  All I knew was that I needed a car with not a lot of options and didn&#146t need to be hassled by aggressive and condescending salesmen.

I had nothing to worry about from the time I walked into the Saturn dealership.  I had called and spoken to a nice salesman named Willie at the Saturn of Rt. 23 in NJ a day or so before and explained exactly what I was looking for, what I could get, etc.  In a matter of 2 days time, Willie had lined up payment options and car options for my needs. He didn&#146t try to oversell me anything and was completely honest with the previous owner as well as any needs the car had.  We were encouraged to make ourselves at home with some coffee and popcorn and given opportunity to test drive prospective cars.  Although the bank had given Willie problems about my credit history, he continued to hound them and hound them until they relented and I was able to get myself into a car.  Eventually, Saturn decided to knock some money off the car price, which is unheard of in Saturn&#146s no-haggle/as-is pricing structure.  His persistence had me eternally grateful.

The day to pick up the car had come a few days later, and to my surprise, the dealership handled everything from the registration to handing me flowers and other freebies when I got the car.  All I had to do was show up and drive.

First, the car handles amazingly well. I never knew a car could be so&#133well, for lack of a better word&#133perky!  The gas mileage is amazing.  I once drove from New York City to the middle of Pennsylvania on only ï¿½ a tank of gas.  

Pretty soon, I was zooming down highways and turning with ease.  The brakes work great, although one of the best features is the A/C and heating systems. With only a couple minutes needed to warm up, the A/C could get ice cold and the heater burning hot without draining the engine or performance at all.  I found the headlights at normal brightness to be somewhat dimmer than expected.  The standard AM/FM stereo system is one of the best standard systems I&#146ve ever seen and has the most awesome bass I&#146ve ever heard in a car without those types of extra options.  The radio at most times easily drowns out the outside driving noises, which unfortunately seem to seep into the car easily. The controls such as the hood release, trunk release, gas cap release, wipers, radio, are all designed to be close to the steering wheel, cutting down on distraction.  There were times while driving where the car doesn&#146t handle bumpy surfaces as well and you feel it.  The car is also set very low to the ground, so it makes parking a pain unless you are really familiar with how the car runs.  A height-adjustable driver&#146s seat would ease this problem, but alas, the option is not available.  It&#146s suggested that you be aware of parking until you get a hang of the car and can park more easily. Another con is the lack of backseat leg room. While there is plenty of leg room in the front, the back leaves people cramped and struggling to get out of the car.  This is why I wouldn&#146t recommend the SC for families of more than 2.  In that case, I think the sedan would be better suited.

However, the 3rd door <I>more</I> than makes up for the backseat.  This, combined with the monster sized trunk area and the versatile folding backseats, it makes loading anything a possibility.  To this day, the most I&#146ve ever fit in there without removing any of the necessities from the trunk is:  a 115-lb woman on one seat, (with the other side folded down), a 7ft Christmas tree, and about 10 huge bags of groceries from the store.

And finally, probably the best reason I have to buy Saturn again&#133amazing customer service.  Saturn customer service meets and exceeds the standards for customer service missing from so many businesses today.  Although, at the local dealership, it is somewhat of a pain to set up an appointment for an oil change weeks in advance, major repairs are done same-day.  A suggestion I would make to the Saturn of Rt. 23 in NJ dealership is to make available a couple of loaner cars like other dealerships do.  Upon bringing in the car, they offer you a free car wash, no questions asked.  They have no problems answering your questions and concerns, such as what this knob does and how you do this or do that&#133
