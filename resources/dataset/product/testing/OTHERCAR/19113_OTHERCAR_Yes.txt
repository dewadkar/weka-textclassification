            I purchased my Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS in February and after driving it everyday I can say that I couldn't have made a better choice!

At first, I was hesitant at even going to the Chevrolet dealership to look at the car.  The photographs on Chevrolet's website do not do this car justice.  In person, this car is beautiful and the moment I drove it I was in love.

The ride is just as smooth as my friend's 2001 Mercedes C class, the engine is quiet yet surprisingly powerful (3.8L SS V6), and the back seat is actually quite spacious (even by some sedan standards!).

Although I would have preferred a rear-wheel drive V8 model, there is only one real complaint that I have.  There is an air deflector under the front bumper which hangs so low that every time I drive out of my driveway (no matter how slowly I go) it scrapes, and the front in general is so close to the ground that I have to be very careful when driving over any dips in the road or else the bottom may scrape.  

Aside from this tiny issue, this car is amazing and I highly recommend it!  The styling finally breaks away from the Lumina look and for the money, it's the best value available right now!
