            We bought this car in 1997 because we wanted a fast,roomy and attractive car. It is all of that. We have been extremely happy with the performance of this car up until we had a accident in it Feb. of 2000. After that we started having problems. Had to take it to the dealer 1 time for transmission slipping and 1 time for one rear window not working. This was in July of 2000 and the car has not had to go back again. We do get some noise from the heater when we turn it on, this just began in the last month, not sure yet what it is. Does seem that we are having too many problems for a car with only 47,000 miles on it but we are not sure it would have occurred if the car had not been in a accident. Overall we love this car and probably will buy another when we decide it is time for a new car. BTW...I LOVE the heads up display, at first was hard to use, but now I NEVER look at gage.
