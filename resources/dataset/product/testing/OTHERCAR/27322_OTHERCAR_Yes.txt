              Our family recently purchased a 2000 Chili Pepper Red Durango SLT with the optional 3rd seat and rear air conditioning.  After looking at several SUVs on the market, the Durango (or as the kids call it Dango)won the whole families approval.   
  Prior to deciding on this purchase we drove every make and model of SUV on the market.  After driving the Durango, we couldn't settle for anything else.  The performance of the 5.9 L engine and the comfort of the ride for the family was unbeatable by the competition.  
  We couldn't be happier with the purchase.  The third seat is a great extra.  Unlike some competitors, it folds away completely and it is full size.  We have two kids who love having their own seat, and my husband loves the 5.9L engine's pick up.  Plus, the design is macho enough for anyone's ego.  
   We would strongly recommend this vehicle for anyone.  In addition, I would recommend buying this vehicle new.  It holds it's value at an unbelievable rate.  We started out looking at used models and found that even models 2 years old were only 2-3 K less than the new one.  We were definetely impressed with that.  <br><br>
