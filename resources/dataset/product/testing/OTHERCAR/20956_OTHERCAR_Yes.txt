            At first glance the PT Cruiser is very mysterious and alluring to the eye. At second glance the PT Cruiser becomes even more attractive and wonderful to look at. In short this car is a masterpiece.  A fine looking machine that has an edge to.

Many people ask what the PT stands for in PT Cruiser. It stands for Personal Transportation, pretty nifty huh? Its exactly what the name says it is, a Personal Transportation Cruiser. To me that sounds pretty neat, and quite unique. 

This car attracts both the young and old. It brings back the memories of decades past to the old who seem young at heart. Its something entirely new to the generations that never saw machinery similar to this. Its a mix between a hot rod, minivan, and sport utility vehicle. A fine mix I might add. Blended together it creates a fine looking automobile.

The Cruiser also attracts many buyers because it is much cheaper than anyone thought it would be. It starts at 16k and goes to around 20k.  Anything in that range is a steal nowadays, and this car proves to be worth every penny and more.  One day this will be a collectors item, it will without a doubt in time to come, be known as a classic automobile.<br><br>
