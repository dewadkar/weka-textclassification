            We bought our 1994 Sentra (white with a lovely black bra) in 1999 with close to 80 thousand miles on it.  We are nearing the 100 thousand mile mark and still going strong.  The only thing we have had to replace is the alternator which was easy (according to my husband).
Being a woman (as well as a home health nurse -- I do NOT need my car dying on me on my way to my dying patient's home) I enjoy a dependable car.  Ours is always that, dependable.  I live in a harsh climate where it is VERY cold in the winter and hot in the summer and the car performs beautifully in all seasons.  I also live in an area in which we have to have emission testing done.  The Sentra always comes through with flying colors... unlike my husband's car.
This car has really lived up to my expectations.  I really enjoy its smooth ride and again, it's dependability.  Being in an area with a lot of snow, it has great handling in all weather condiditions.  I have never once felt unsafe in this car (when I am driving).  
This car is great for newly-weds or small families.  I have one son and we did have a problem getting his car seat to install in the center of the backseat and so we had to install it on the passenger side backseat.  This causes the passenger side front seat to have to be pushed forward a bit, but as soon as we're able to turn his car seat around that won't be a problem.  I plan to buy a bit larger car in the future (because it could be a little tight once my child actually has legs) but for a small family this car is great!  When we take friends though, it is a bit of a squeeze in the backseat.  That is what makes me want a larger car.
Frankly, we bought this car because it was fairly cheap out of the Auto Auction which my father-in-law attends faithfully.
Now, a word of caution about our seat belts.  They're the kind that come back when you shut the door and start the car.  Sometimes it freaks me out, and if I'm at the drive- through I either have to un-hook it or open the door.  BUT, I find that all to be a very small price to pay for all the dependability we have recieved from it.  I would buy this car again, and again and again.
