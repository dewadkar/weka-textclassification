            I live on top of a mountain in New Hampshire and require a 4-wheel or all-wheel drive vehicle just to get home. I have had a Chevy.Blazer, Toyota Tercel and since the Fall of 1995 have been driving a 1996 Subaru Legacy Outback. While the vehicle came with All-Weather tires, I found they did not provide sufficient traction to get up hills on occasion and I also skidded off the road from time to time. The car is touted for use in New England and ads show off-the-road driving in Australia. However, my first experience with it was discouraging. 

After the first winter I installed snow-tires, the next fall and found the car to react much better. The snowtires gave the needed traction and I wish that the dealer had advised me to install them, when I bought the car. The anti-lock brakes also took sometime to get used to, since I had never had them, prior to owning this car. 

The undercarriage of the car is higher than that of my Toyota Tercel and allows it to ride over light snow on a road, that would have bound up the Toyota. I think that the vehicle has a good suspension and one is able to ride over &quot; Spring frost heaves&quot; in the road, whereas I was forced to slow down to drive over them, in my Chevy Blazer.

I now have 57,000 miles on the Subaru and intend to buy a 2000 model in the Spring. One minor problem is rim leaks on the alloy rims caused by oxidation of the metal. This has caused flat tires. Care must be taken to scrape and even paint some of the interior of the wheel rims in order to keep the tires fully inflated. No doubt, this is due, in part to the use of raod salts in winter. But one would think that a car made for such winters would not have this problem. I will try to get steel rims on the next car.

I have always had the car serviced at the Subaru Dealer in Keene, NH and have gotten good service and fair prices. To check them out, I priced replacement of brakes at a dealer north of me, in Claremont, NH and found their price to be $100 more, so it would pay to shop even dealers for  prices on service. All in all Subaru is a car that gets you where you want to go, in all seasons of the year. (The heated seats are also a good feature)<br><br>
