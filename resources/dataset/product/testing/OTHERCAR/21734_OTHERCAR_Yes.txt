            I would rather eat shards of broken glass than buy a car. So when my Toyota was heaving its last, you can imagine my despair. Shoot, it only had 300,000 miles on it! I went from car place to car place, and finally found my little red 1998 Chevy Cavalier. I can't say I fell in love, but I definitely fell in "like". 

The newer style Cavaliers have a much sportier look about them than their boxier predecessors. The rounded front end makes it look sporty and aerodynamic. The headlights look like the eyes of your little buddy, the car. 

The interior was pleasant as well, at first. The bucket front passenger seats are comfortable, but a little short on space. The backseat is really small, but who rides in their own backseat? Still, I didn't hold this against the car until my daughter was born and we placed an infant carrier carseat in the car. In order for the seat to fit safely in the backseat, we have to place the front passenger seat all the way forward and bolt upright. Wonderful if you are driving midgets around in your front passenger seat, a nightmare for normal people. 

The Quad 4 engine makes for a zippy, fun ride. It comes equipped with the 100,000 mile spark plugs, which Chevrolet says you are not supposed to replace until you have driven 100,000 miles. I say that is a bit overblown, approximately 60,000 miles is a good time to replace the spark plugs in this vehicle, but push it to 70,000 miles, the Quad 4 engine is a pain to work on. One great feature about the engine is the Dex-cool coolant system. For those that are not familiar with Dex-cool, you will know it by its orange rather than the usual green coolant color. The best part about Dex-cool is, you do not have to replace or flush your engine coolant for 5 years or 150,000 miles, whichever occurs first. A nice touch in my opinion. 

Gas mileage in this vehicle is pretty good, I find myself getting about 28 mpg in the city and about 32 highway, not bad at all. 

Handling is great in this vehicle. You can take turns really fast if you wish, and the 1998 Cavalier will hang tight. The traction control feature is wonderful when it comes to slick or gravelly roads. 

I did have to repair the brakes at 50,000 miles, somewhat sooner than I was expecting. They were, however, easy to work on. 

All in all this is a great little car for an inexpensive price!
