            I have had my 90� S-10 for four years, and it has been a great truck.  Dependability has to be its greatest strength, and interior longevity its most significant weakness.  

To my amazement, every switch and knob still executes its assigned function properly.  Occasionally, the windshield wipers will go off with out me doing anything.  I just tell my friends that the windshield must have sensed something on it.  Some people will rage on about the cheaply assembled interior, but when it comes to repairs it�s a Godsend.  I have not had to make any repairs on the interior, and I�m not dreading it.   

Driving the S-10 is almost like maneuvering a car, only you have the luxury of being up a little higher.  I feel more comfortable driving the S-10 than I do anything else I have ever driven. (Including 94� Toyota Celica, 93� Toyota Camry, and 90� Chevy Suburban).  

The 4.3L V6 that Chevrolet has to offer is the heart of the truck.  When talking about engines, one word that almost everyone knows is �Three-fifty�.  I think the 350cu. inch V8 has been the standout in Chevrolet�s engine line, it is legendary.  The 4.3L that powers a good deal of S-10�s is the same block  as the 350, but with two cylinders shaved off.  This is one of the reasons I trust my truck more than I do most people.  I would drive my 90� S-10 anywhere, anytime.

The 90� Chevy S-10 is a lot of truck in a little package.  The problems you may encounter are for the most part cheap to repair.  I�ve only had my truck for three years, and it has done a lot of good things for me. The shape it�s in now, I only expect more.
