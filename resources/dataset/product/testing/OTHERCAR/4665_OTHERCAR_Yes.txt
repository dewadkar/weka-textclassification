            I am here to tell you about my experience with a 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier. When I was out to purchase a car i decided this would be the best and safest for the money.  Well I was wrong.  I have only 43,000 miles on my car and this is what has gone wrong.  I have had rear brake problems for an unknown reason, which of course happened as soon as the warranty ran out.  Shortly after purchasing the car a hose broke.  The muffler on my car as well as many other Cavaliers makes a very loud embarrassing noise.  Of course it can not be explained why this happens either.  I have also had problems with the plastic inside the car breaking. The worst of which is the inside driver's door.  It is constantly falling off.  I was involved in an accident and the airbags in my car went off.  I was not going fast but was given a ticket because the police said for them to go off i must have been going too fast.  It was later found out that the air bags in this year Cavalier were faulty. Of course i found this out too late. My car also makes loud noises that come from under the car, which are unexplained.  Now you might be thinking this guy doesn't take care of his car.  I am here to tell you I take great care of my car. I wash it constantly, get the oil changed on time.  <br><br>
