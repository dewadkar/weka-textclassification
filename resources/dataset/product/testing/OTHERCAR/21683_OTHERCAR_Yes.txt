            In 1998, I found my self in need of a 4-door car--putting a 1 yr old in the back of a 2-door just got to be too difficult. I looked around and against my first instinct, I bought the 1998 Chevy Prism. It had been made by their GEO line in the past and I have reservations against buying a GEO.

Well, much to my chagrin, it has been a wonderful car. It is a cute sedan, with a much roomier trunk than one would think. The rear seat fold down for extra cargo space (I can't currently use this feature, as my 2 yr old is always back there). The gas mileage is incredible! I only fill it up once every month.

It handles well and rides smoothly. It is a little noisy on the freeway, but not too bad. One of my favorite features is the cup holder in the back along with the dual- cupholders in the front--ingenious!!!

The steering wheel adjusts and it is power everything, at a low price!! Great little mommy car.<br><br>
