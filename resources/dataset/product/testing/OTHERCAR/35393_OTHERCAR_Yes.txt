            I have driven Mercedes, Volvo, Audi, VW, SAAB as far as German cars go. Every one has very distinct pleasures to them, each has it's own personality. The BMW 325i is no exception. The 2.5 6 cyl. engine will outperform my Audi 2.8 easily. This little engine has torque! The ride for a low sitting sports sedan is extremely comfortable compared to others in it's class. It has automatic 5 speed tranny with a sports shift mode and a Manual shift mode. I prefer the sport shift over manual as it is not as sophisticated as the Audi. However, when in sports mode, I can reach high speeds without it even getting out of 3rd. I routinely run my cars at 120-160 mph, and this little car has no problem getting there. Though it is Rear wheel drive, the traction control is essential if you live in snowy areas as I do. I also live around very steep hills. I never drove it in snow until I got slammed by surprise one day and had this car. I was amazed at how well it handled and how controlled it was at safe speeds. As long as you do not goose it, it will handle fine. 

The interior is very subtle with all the controls facing the driver. It has a duo zoned climate control and with the Winter package I have heated power seats, heated mirrors, heated windshield washers, heated door locks and traction control. The wipers are also in synch with the speedometer and they wipe on Normal setting with the speed of the car.

Cruise has it's own control arm, not built in like most others. A computer system that gives you time, speed, mph, mpg, range of tank, temperature, and a memo function.

The beauty of this car is that it will drive anyway the driver wants it to! Slow and easy, or fast! The cornering ability is superior to almost anything in it's class. The low roar of the engine and the way this car almost instinctively responds to the driver makes it an incredibly fun car to drive anywhere!

Mileage? For a heavy car, I get around 23-24 city and get 32 highway at speeds of around 70. The maintenance is cheaper than any other German car if you use someone other than the dealer. 

If you have never driven a BMW for more than a test drive..it does take a little getting used to in order to appreciate the engineering of this vehicle...I suggest taking one out for a weekend and really put it through the turns. It is quite common to see these cars hit well over 300k and still run like a new clock.
