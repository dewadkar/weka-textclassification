            Intro:
I was in the market for an SUV to replace my Ford Explorer. In fact, other than a Nissan King Cab in the early 90's, I was exclusively a buyer of American built trucks. The Kia caught my attention, quite honestly, because of its price and styling. Researching a little further, I began to understand there was something substantial behind the good looks. Additionally, my initial wariness at buying a Kia was eased when I looked over the concrete details of the 10 year warranty. For example, they will even provide for a hotel room if you break down more than 150 miles from home! It helped that the varied reviewer remarks I saw while researching all seemed consistent on solid build quality.  

I need something a bit more substantial than a car-frame SUV, and it looked like I would be going for another ubiquitous Explorer. I have woodland in the Adirondacks, and actually do need a 4-wheel low range vehicle with towing capabilities from time to time. Having put several thousand miles to date on my 2004 Sorento, much of it in 4 wheel drive, I can attest to its sure-footedness in off road and snowy road conditions. Twice now this winter, the standard skid plates have inadvertently performed well as snow pushers!  It certainly has a more secure stance than my more-or-less first generation 1997 Explorer.  

Interior:
The Sorento's interior feels roomier than what I was used to. The wider body benefits interior space, as does the cab forward design. The windshield sits further away from you, as does the roof-line, giving the front seat occupants a commanding, cavernous viewpoint. 

As I noted in the overview, I was disappointed at first with the unlit steering column controls for the lights, fog lights, front wipers and rear wipers.  Initially the controls were confusing during night driving. I have found now after adapting to the logic that it is not so difficult. I still feel back-lighting is a feature Kia should consider in the future.

In one review, I also read of some disappointment with the sun visors. I would contrast this with my experience. A pleasant discovery is that when using the visors on the side windows, they actually telescope outward to stretch to the back of the drivers window! They also insert firmly under the hand-strap above the door.  I see this as an innovative design. What is missing is the second flap to keep glare from both the side and front windows when you need it. On this point I would agree most other SUV's are one flap ahead.

One interior gripe I hesitate to mention, since generally no one else offers it standard anyway, is the windshield wiper heater light. It is on the switch itself, in the middle of the dashboard. This clashes with the side view mirror/rear window defroster, whose switch is near the windshield heat, however the light is in the instrument cluster. It appears as an afterthought in the design and I find it odd to have to look in different places for similar items.  That said, I absolutely LOVE both the side view mirror defroster and the windshield wiper heat. Kia certainly did its homework on cold climate driving. 

Drive-train:
I have the 3.5 liter 5 speed manual transmission. With it, I have a blast. It is smooth from a stand-still and accelerates quickly. I find it a bit peppier than my Explorer, which had a 4 liter 5 spd automatic.

Exterior:
What can I say about the exterior, other than sexy, sexy, and sexy?!? The 2004 LX Sport comes with roof rack, running boards, tow hitch, and alloy wheels.  It appears the appearance concerns seen in the 2003 reviews regarding the base wheels have been addressed in the 2004 models.

Conclusion:
Some final thoughts for the review: Being a seasoned owner of SUV&#146s with recalls and bulletins, when I looked into buying a new SUV, quality was important. I looked through the recall history and service bulletins published on the Sorento. While it is only a bit over a year into the product cycle, to date, there have been none. Also, to my surprise when going to the Kia worldwide web site I found they build trucks, heavy duty trucks. Lots of them! These guys seem to have merged a great deal of knowledge with an excellent warranty program and excellent design.  
My minor interior critique aside, I found the Kia Sorento more than held its&#146 own in the demanding SUV market. The Sorento is definitely worthy of your consideration should you be looking as well.
