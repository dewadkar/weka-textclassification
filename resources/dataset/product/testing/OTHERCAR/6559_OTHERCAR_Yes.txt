            I purchased a grand caravan 1998 at the end of 1997.  I have put over 30,000 miles on it.  Took a long trip from North Louisiana to North Wyoming with 4 adults and 2 teenagers and a whole lot of luggage.  This van rode smooth the whole way.  It has traveled to the highest paved road located by Denver Colorado, From northern Wyoming to South Dakota to Mount Rushmore and back to Wyoming to Devils Tower.  The trip was lengthy and did not have any problems.  When looking at other vehicles, I cannot find another minivan or sports utility with the spacious amount of leg room that it offers.  The teenagers love having their own captain's chair for everyday comfort and the sliding doors on both sides allows for them to get out and in easier. I would highly recommend this this product if you are looking for dependable, spacious, and economical minivan for your family.
