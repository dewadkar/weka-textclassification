            This is an excellent digital camera!  Very high resolution, takes great pictures, and it's really easy to operate.  I've had it about a year now, and I've pretty much given up using normal cameras.  

I bought a 32MB card for it, and now I can take hundreds of pictures before needing to download.  This is great, because it means you can take a lot more pictures.  Just shoot away!  Delete the ones you don't like, keep the ones you do.

The tools that come with the camera are satisfactory for editing pictures and the like.  If you're going to do serious editing work you probably want to purchase a separate software package.  Most major software packages are compatible and will read images right off of the camera.

The only downside with this camera is the lack of USB connection.  This means downloading images from your camera will take a long time.  But if you set the images to copy directly to the hard drive, then it goes fairly quickly.  With 300 images this make take a long time, so go pop a cool one and come back later.

If you don't use the viewer on the back of the camera, the batteries will last a long, long time.  But if you use the viewer, you'd better get some rechargeable batteries, because it will drain the power rapidly.<br><br>
