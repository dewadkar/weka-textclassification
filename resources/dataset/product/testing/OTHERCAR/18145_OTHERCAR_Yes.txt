            We bought our Nissan Quest in 1994.  We have put over 73,000 miles on it and have only had to do routine maintenance on the vehicle.  The only major expense we had was when a dealer misinformed us about a rusted through resonator and basically conned us into buying an entire new exhaust train.  It has given reliable trouble free operation over the last six years.  One of the cons about minivans is when there's a crack in the windshield they can be expensive to have replaced.  It is advisable to make sure your insurance has good provisions for windshield replacement.  Another con is that despite a V-6 and lighter weight than heavier RWD American cars, the mileage is no better than a large American tank.  We shopped for minivans using Consumer Reports as a guideline and were very impressed with the accuracy of their evaluation.  We'd buy another in a heartbeat.<br><br>
