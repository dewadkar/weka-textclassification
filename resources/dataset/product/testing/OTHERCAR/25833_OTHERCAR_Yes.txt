                 I recently purchased a Jeep Cherokee '99 sport and I couldn't be happier. With a small price tag, the new Jeep is a steal.
     Although a bit smaller, and little less comfortable than its competition comprised of luxury SUV's, the Jeep Cherokee definitely holds its ground. Among all the SUV's in the $15,000-25,000 price range, the Cherokee is definitely the best. It handles well, is comfortable, and is great in rugged terrain. Recently I took a trip up to New Hampshire and took the Cherokee off-road. It performed extremely well while driving through snow, mud, and some sand. It was very fun actually. 
     While it is not quite as nice as its big sister, the Grand Cherokee, it is still a great SUV, at a much more reasonable price. If you're in the market for an SUV, perhaps one not quite as extravagant as the Grand Cherokee or a Lexus, I strongly recommend the Cherokee.<br><br>
