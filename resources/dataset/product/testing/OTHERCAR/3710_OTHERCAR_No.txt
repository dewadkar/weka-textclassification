            The advertising for Chevrolet truck says &quot;Like A Rock&quot;.  Well, the Chevrolet Silverado is definitely a tough truck when it comes to looks and power, but the quality is still typical GM territory.

The looks could be well described as &quot;Blue Collar&quot;.  It is a simple evolution of the old Chevy trucks.  There is no way this design is going to be mistaken for a Ford or Dodge.  It is most definitely designed to bring the &quot;tough guy&quot; out of you.

The completely new interior is definitely an improvement over the last years model.  Everything is easy to reach and very well marked.  The instrumentation is complete and it would be hard to find any fault with the HVAC system.

Once on the road, there is more than enough power with the V8 engines.  In fact, if you drive a 2 wheel drive version with the standard tires and wheels, there is way too much power without a bed load of stuff.  You will send the tires to the scrap heap before you can say &quot;I should have bought a four wheel drive!&quot;.

While initial quality seemed very good, after only 4 months of use, my Silverado started to squeak from the interior.  I had never abused it or taken it off road so I was a little surprised.  Some of my friends who rode in the truck definitely noticed the squeaks (they drive BMW's and are finicky about quality control).  For a tough truck, the noises were sure a disappointment.

The HVAC also decided to join in the frustration.  Though it only happened twice.  the fan refused to blow any air after the truck was started one evening.  After turning off the engine and restarting, the fan was all right.  Almost like a PC to have to restart.  Was this the &quot;Windows&quot; edition of the truck?

One of the low points of driving a pick up with a V8 is gas mileage.  This one is no exception.  I averaged about 12-15 mpg at the best of times.

Who should buy this truck.  It's for anyone looking for a roomy and powerful workhorse.  If you're an Urban Cowboy, the size and mileage should convice you to look at a smaller truck.
