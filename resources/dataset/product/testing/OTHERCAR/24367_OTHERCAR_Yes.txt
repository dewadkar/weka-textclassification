            I have owned this camera for about about 8 months and I love it. The major reasons:
- Takes consistent, great shots, great color, 2.1 megapixel
- Highly portable, fits in large pocket
- Looks great, solidly engineered
- Swivel lens is useful (and unique), enables shots at interesting angles
- MPEG feature is cool, I use it occasionally to capture short,fun videos, send birthday messages

A few things that I feel you must get to enhance this camera:
-For laptop users, get PCMCIA memory stick adapter, downloads are a snap since memory stick is seen as a hard drive
-For desktop users, get USB memory card reader
-Larger memory stick, 32MB or above, 4MB shipped with it is not enough

To address some of the criticism:
I was wary about the lack of viewfinder, But now I do not miss it as I am able to take shots at interesting angles.

Zoom was not high on my priority list, but if it is on yours, then this camera will not work for you.  The compromise was worth it for me.
