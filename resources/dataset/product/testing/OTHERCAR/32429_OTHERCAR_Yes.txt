            The Honda Civic 2 Dr Coupe is a definite must buy more many people.  It is just an all around great automobile.  Its comfortable to ride in on those long trips. While you are on those long trips gas mileage is great as well.  Close to 30mpg is on average for this car.  And if you want speed this car doesn't hold back.  The engine may not seem big but its light weight body makes this one peppy vehicle.  
   The Civic is a definite must have car. I bought it for my long trips to school and i have saved hundreds of dollars on gas compared to what i would be driving.  It also is very low on maintainance as long as you have the regularly scheduled oil change and tune-ups this car will last you a lifetime and i know mine will.  
  So when you are at the desk and the dealer hands you the keys to your brand new Honda Civic just remember to let the good times roll.
