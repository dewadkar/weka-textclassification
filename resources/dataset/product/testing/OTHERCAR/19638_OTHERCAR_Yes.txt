            I bought this car with 7,000 miles on it. 4,000 miles later, it has been trouble free and I am very happy with with the car and my Toyota experience in general. I have the GT - automatic - with CD player, spoiler and sunroof. Great sound system, with lots of pep - great car for the money. The trunk is HUGE - I made a big thanksgiving dinner and fit about 12 big bags of groceries in the trunk. You'd be surprised how much can fit in the trunk. I get lots of compliments on the car. I almost bought the 2 door Accord - and I'm glad I didn't. The interior is very sporty - there are lots of upholstery color options (if you're buying it new). There are also tons of performance and appearance aftermarket products available for the Celica (spoilers, fender flares, neon lightes, all the stuff you see on "The Fast and the Furious"). Thus far the car has been great - My only complaint is the visability out the back - the spoiler is right in the way when you look in the rear view mirror. It is EXTREMELY difficult to back out of a parking space and see what is going on behind you.
