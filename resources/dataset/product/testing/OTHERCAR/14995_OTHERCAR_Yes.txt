            Well i am parshall to this camera because i own one.  For people who do not need to take movie clips and who are novices at digital photography then this is the camera for them.  Sony doesn't skimp you on anything for the cheapo price.  Unfortunently I paid $499 for mine instead of the listed price they have on this site.  In fact everywhere I have seen them they have been priced $499.

  The thing that caught my attention on this camera is that it has a 3 1/2 floppy drive built in to the camera, instead of the flash slots in other digital cameras.  This means when the disk is full you just pop it out and pop in another one, instead of finding a computer to download the pictures on from the flash card.  

  It has a LCD screen on the back along with many other functions such as picture effect like Black and white, Negative Art, and Sepia which looks like the old western pictures.  Other functions include flash options, 10x zoom, and what type of file you want to save the picture in.

  Another thing I love about this camera is that it allows you to see the picture you just took and if you don't like it you can delete it right then and there so it doesn't take up space.

  Some of its downfalls though is that it's a little bulky and the weight is moderate.  It also has auto focus so you don't have to worry about the clarity of the pictures.  When the battery is dead it only takes about an hour to recharge to full capacity.  Over all i give it a 4 out of 5.<br><br>
