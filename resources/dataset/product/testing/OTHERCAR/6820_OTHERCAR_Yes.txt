            The 1998 Mercury Sable. I decied one day that i needed a new car and I went looking for a really good car, but also not too much money. One of the first plavces i stopped at was a Ford Mercury Dealer and they should be a 1998 Sky Blue Sable. The car looked really good and was comfortable so I took it for a ride to see how it drove. To my surprise it had a smooth ride and the air conditioner worked fast and made the entire car very comfortable. In the winter the heat works just as well warming the enitre car. I think that this car could be driven anywhere and make the driver along with its passengers a nice calm, quite, comfortable car. the shocks work exceptionly well to give a nice smooth ride no matter where you are on the road. I have not taken this car off the road yet so i don't know how it rides off the road, but i garentee that it will give you a nice comfortable ride. i have fallen asleep on this car plenty of times. there are speakers located at many different areas and allows you to listen to music much easier. thank you for your time.<br><br>
