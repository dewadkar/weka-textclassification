            I�ve written a few epinions on heavy duty diesel pickups, but now I�d like to do one on the best truck I�ve ever owned, a 1990 Toyota regular cab, short bed, 4X4 with 5 speed manual transmission, the 20RE 2.4L 4 cylinder engine, all terrain tires and no factory options.  We bought it used in the fall of 1991 for $9,500 from an acquaintance, the owner of a small used car lot and towing service . It was barely a year old and already had 25,000 miles on it, but was in excellent condition.

We had just moved to a remote little homestead near the oil ghost town of Pithole in northwest Pennsylvania., and needed something that would get us in and out through deep snow and mud. The five miles of secondary roads to the main highway were not plowed very often in the winter, but our little Toyota never failed us! On a few occasions I even wound up finishing our mailman�s route when his 4X4 Ford Bronco couldn�t get through!

Although it is a small truck with just enough room for two adults and a small child, it can easily haul 25 bales of hay or 1,500 pounds of grain. It handles deep snow and muddy dirt roads exceptionally well and gets just over 20 miles per gallon of gas on the highway. As to why it does so well in adverse conditions, I hate to admit it, but I really don�t know! It doesn�t have exceptional ground clearance or advanced all wheel drive, it just goes! Maybe this is due to its light weight - it doesn�t sink but almost floats through the deep stuff? I�ve driven it through farm fields with knee high snow and on washed out, muddy logging roads that I wouldn�t even consider trying with our bigger 4X4�s.
 
We kept the truck for seven years and 100,000 more miles. It never got stuck and we only had to  replace the exhaust pipe and muffler, in addition to routine maintenance! We recently sold it to our nephew, who is a firemen and always on call. It still doesn�t burn oil and even has it�s original battery! It�s had some recent body work, but other than that, it�s still going strong and looking forward to another winter in which to showoff its surefootedness. 

If you need an inexpensive vehicle for demanding driving circumstances, I can tell you without hesitation, that a well maintained, pre-Tacoma, Toyota 4X4 truck, such as this one, would make an excellent choice if you�re lucky enough to find one!<br><br>
