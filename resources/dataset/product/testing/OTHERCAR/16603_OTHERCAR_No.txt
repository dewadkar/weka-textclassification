            From the point I first saw one, I thought this car was one of the most beautiful sports cars out there. I lusted after it for several years, and then a few years after I graduated from college, I finally got a 2 year-old model with 35k miles. It was the base model, manual 5-speed, dark metallic green with grey fabric interior. 

Driving this car was a pleasure, at least at first. It handled very well and was quite the attention-getter on the road. But soon, problems started. I had to have extensive brake work done which cost about $500. It was a used car, so I wrote that off as prior misuse. Then my air conditioner quit working, so I had the freon charged. After about 6 months the freon leaked out again, and they told me it needed a new compressor. I decided to do without A/C for awhile as I had just put new tires on it. Then my glove compartment started rattling like crazy. I had to remove everything from it and leave it open so it wouldn't drive me nuts. Turns out the plastic piece that the glove box latch attaches to had cracked. My mechanic called Mitsubishi, the dealer, and several parts stores, and they all said they couldn't get the part, that I had to buy the WHOLE DASHBOARD. That was way more than I wanted to invest in it, especially given that the car wasn't holding up well and I was unhappy with the quality. I ended up trading it in on my current car a few months later. I was sick of the lousy quality and didn't feel like so many things should be going wrong on a car with less than 50k miles on it. <br><br>
