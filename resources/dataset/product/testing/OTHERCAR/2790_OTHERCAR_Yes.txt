            This camera is quite a great value for the price.  The D-340R is equipped with 1.3 mega pixels.  The downfall with this camera is that it is only equipped with a digital zoom (no optical).  A great feature is the lens cover, which also acts as an on/off switch.  The cover slides open and turns the camera on when shut it does a great job of protecting the sensitive lens.  A feature that stands above others in this category is the battery life.  This camera seems to go on and on without battery run down.  I would recommend Olympus lithium rechargeable batteries � and for $50.00 you can purchase the recharger.  The size of this digital camera is awesome, it feels like a 35 MM � it is so compact and comfortable to take pictures with.  The speed from shot to shot is outstanding even in high-resolution mode(s).  The quality that this camera produces is better than expected from a camera in this price category.  I would highly recommend this item.<br><br>
