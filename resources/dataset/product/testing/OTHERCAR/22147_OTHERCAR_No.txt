            Buying a digital Camera has been a goal of mine
for quite some time, but the high prices have not
allowed me to. . . I ran across the DSC-350 D-Link
Digital Camera priced at Staples for $99.99 and 
thought I'd pick it up and give it a try. . .

The Dual Mode Camera allows users to store up to
500 photos or 4.5 minutes of Video, with up to
1024 x 768 Resolution. 

Comes with PhotoSuite III
and Videowave III CD-Rom Editing Software.

The Camera is quickly and easily connected to
your computer through it's USB Port for downloading
photos or video.

I've been going picture crazy, but it didn't take
long to notice that the camera is very difficult
to focus manually. It also requires perfect lighting
conditions to allow you to take a picture. There 
must be plenty of light. And with that plenty of 
light - your photos are easily glared beyond
recognition. (The Camera does not have a flash or
flash add-on capabilities.) 

Due to it's low budget price, the camera does not
have a photo preview window like most of your higher
priced cameras. Therefore you do not know at the time
whether or not your photos actually turned out
until you download them to your computer, and then
it's obdviously too late to take another shot at
a different angle or focus setting. 

Due to the manual focus, trying to take video
clips is nearly impossible if the moving object
you're taping moves towards and away from
you while recording. 

The resolution is good if you happened to 
take a picture with the perfect focus setting.
I've taken hundreds of pictures, and on occasion
you get a few that turned out exceptionally well.

I would not recommend purchasing this camera.
Frustration sets in within a few minutes and
it's not worth taking a dozen shots of the same
thing hoping to get a single good one to turn out.
