            Last summer we were expecting our first grandchild. His father
and I both bought the Epson Photo PC 800. We had a little
over a week to take practice shots before the big day arrived.
Both of us were taking photos during labor and delivery
and got excellent shots.
The most fantastic feature of this camera is the ability to 
record sound for up to ten seconds after the photo is taken.
I recorded the first cry, grandparents oos and ahs, moms first
words to the baby etc. We also got some excellent photos with
enough detail to show the antibiotic ointment put in his eyes.
My son and I use our cameras frequently and have gotten 30 mg memory
cards to add to the 8 mg the camera comes with.
The Image expert program that comes with the camera is the
only image editing program I use unless I am doing composits
or something more complicated that I need to use Photoshop.
The only problem I have had with the camera is getting the usb
to work, but once it was configured properly have had no problems
downloading photos.<br><br>
