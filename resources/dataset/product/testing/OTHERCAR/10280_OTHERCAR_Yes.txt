            I am a proud owner of a 1997 Nissan Sentra GXE. I never really looked at this type or size car before being a family of four (3yo &amp; 5mo old). My old car was a 1993 Grand Prix. I didn't think we could fit into this car when the dealer showed it to us but when we all got in &amp; took it for a test drive..... MAN I THOUGHT IT WAS AWESOME!!! There's enough room for all of us. Leg room, Head room &amp; stretching room is plentiful(seeings how I'm only 5'8&quot; I can probably fit into any car). Everything is well within reach. Tilt steering, 5 speed manual transmission(cause it was cheaper), cruise control, am/fm cassette(which I hope I can change to a CD player if my wife lets me.... PLEASE HEATHER?), remote for trunk &amp; gas door is on one handle next to the drivers seat. The only thing I don't like is the really small tires (155/80-13 on stock wheels). I am hoping to upgrade the tire/wheels this summer to 205/50-15's. The handling of this car is wonderful... it zigs &amp; zags whenever I need it to. It has a bit of zip to it as well despite being a 4 cyl 1.6 ltr motor. It has 60/40 split rear folding seats so if something doesn't fit in the trunk.... poof... there's more room; or if I need to get to the trunk from inside for some odd reason... I can. It fits into all the small parking spaces unlike my previous car. Im gonna hate to trade it in a couple years when the time comes but then I might just have to get another one. <br><br>
