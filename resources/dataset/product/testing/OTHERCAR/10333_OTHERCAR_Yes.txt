            **** Automobile - Classy and Reliable

The Jaguar has come along way in the last number of years.  I am currently on my 2nd XJ6.  I just returned a lease on a 1995 XJ6 and recently purchased a 1997 XJ6 Vanden Plas.  This is the car above all cars.  It's beautiful, reliable, luxurious and drives well.  The only bad thing about it is the guilt that comes from knowing I spent a lot of money on a depreciating asset - but it's worth it.

This car is exciting from the first moment you look at it.  It is unique and gets a lot of stares.  The inside (especially on the Vanden Plas model) is extremely luxurious - from the inlaid burl walnut to the fur mats to the fold down picnic tables in the back seat (not particularly necessary) to the heated front &amp; back seats.  

This is a car that is made well and the extended warranty on used Jaguars makes it even more reliable.

This car doesn't have as many gadgets as some top-of-the-line Mercedes and BMWs, but it has what's necessary.

I recommend a used Jaguar for anybody looking at luxury cars (after 1 or 2 years the depreciation is such that you can pick up the car at a 20-40% discount from the new price).
