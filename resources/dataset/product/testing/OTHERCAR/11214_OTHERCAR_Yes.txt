            After my 9-year old Plymouth Voyager Minivan was stolen I decided to replace it with a 1998 upscale Chrysler T&amp;C LXi.  I would have to say the comparison was like night and day!  Where the Voyager felt light, underpowered, spartan, and utilitarian, the Town&amp;Country feels solid, powerful, responsive, comfortable and luxurious.  In particular the 3.8L engine is very responsive for such a large vehicle.

The overall road feel of the vehicle, from acceleration, to steering and cornering to braking, is that of a luxury sedan.  The sound system and air conditioning/heating system function very well.  The power rear vent windows are great for flow through ventilation.   Although I was skeptical about the left side passenger sliding door, I find we use it all the time.   

The overall fit and finish is extremely good and the quality of the paint (cranberry color) is excellent.  I usually get about 21 mpg on the freeway and about 16 mpg in mixed city driving.  The car was essentially defect free when delivered.  The only problem in a year and a half (and 24,000 miles) is that someone bumped the driver side collapsible mirror and instead of folding and bouncing back, the spring broke.  The dealer replaced it under warranty.<br><br>
