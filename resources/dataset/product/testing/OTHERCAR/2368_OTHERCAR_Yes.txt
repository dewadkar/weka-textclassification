            Let me begin by saying I am a very hard to please person, and I attempt to present the most complete and unbiased opinion i can.  Thus, i will divide this review into sections:

STORY
My last car was destroyed in a rear end collision (the other guys fault =]), and so I was on the search.  To make it short, i was looking for about 3 weeks and couldn't find a car worth a minute of my time; so i went to an auction with a friend and found the maxima.  I sat down and fell in love, and got it at the right price, so off I drove...

LOOKS/EXTERIOR
An attractive body design with gentle curves, the '92 maxima is arguably the best body shape yet.  My model is 11 years old, and still looks modern.  The finish is attractive, and there is no rust on the body except by the trunk (when the lid is open, it is along the rim).  Clearcoat is still in great shape on the body, but not in other areas (on rims and mirrors it is beginning to peal).

COMFORT/ROOMINESS
One of the areas the maxima shines, THIS is something you'll remember.  Custom-comfort controls line to two front seats, making them more comfortable than any chairs in my house.  They have MUCH more than ample room in every direction, and the tilt steering wheel ensures driver comfort.  In the back, there is also a great deal of room for 3 kids, or 2 adults (the middle back seat leaves something to be desired, as its more of a place to put the armrest down. Most likely uncomfortable for 3 adults).  All in all a very spacious, comfortable ride (my model has velour seats, some have leather... shop around!)  Trunk space is ample (room for groceries, yes), but not exceptional (room for a drumset, no) -- (includes its own custom jack in the trunk wall, and room for a spare though).
There are cupholders, but only two up front (and different sizes; a pain if the whole family goes to McDonald's or something)

DRIVE
One wouldn't think the maxima is as quick as it is.  Thats your first mistake.  The 3.0 V6 in mine (SE editions get 190 HP -- WOW) is more than enough to get you out of a tight spot, or to show your friend's ride a thing or two.  It really performs like a strong V8.  The Maxima is the fastest ride for the buck, no exception.  There is also an option on the dash by the shift which can change the Transmition's setting from "Power" to "Comfort" or "Auto" (the car decides based on pedal force).  This has an immense effect either way, with the comfort giving you the better gas milage, and the power giving you an enormous acceleration advantage.  If youre curious how this works, email me. It steers with a bull's-eye power steering system, not being too strong but yet enough to go one handed.  This car is a REAL pleasure to drive, with everything responding right as it should.

ENGINE/RELIABILITY
Here's the real kicker -- is it a car thats going to last?  Fortunately, this is something Nissan is known for!  100,000 miles on this car hasn't hurt it under the hood too much.  The exception was the distributor, which the car needed when bought (thats what i get for buying from an auction I guess =D).  This was difficult for me to diagnose, and so the dealer told me, fixed it, and now she runs great.  This was expensive however, but I guess I'm the only one who's really had this problem.  I have heard other people complaining of fuel injectors, but mine are in great shape.  Spark plugs/rotor/cap have been replaced, but these are tune-up items.  All in all, ONE piece replaced under the hood since the factory (not including tune-ups).  Not bad for 100,300 miles.  Take care of this car and give it it's changes, and it'll take car of you.  I've heard of people that get 300,000 miles or more outta these cars and still drive em.

~FUEL ECONOMY~
Depending on how you drive it and with what options (Transmition under Power or Comfort (Automatic only), Automatic or Manual) will affect your milage.  Overall, i experience the following:
@20-23MPG city
@25-28MPG freeway
both of these are hard to beat in a new V6 engine.  If you don't ever race your car or try to squeel the tires, your gas mileage will be significantly higher..... =D

OTHER PRAISE
Fun to drive!!!!  High capacity (90amp) alternator standard, real good for those like me that like to put in a large amp!  Nice conveniences you never knew you'd love are here like keyless (coded) entry, lights in every door (good for long/latenight road trips), cornering light (a headlight that illuminates on the side when a turn signal is activated), dimmer switch, etc.

OTHER GRIPES
Avoid the BOSE system if you ever plan to upgrade your stereo -- if you wish to replace one part YOU MUST REPLACE THEM ALL (you've been warned =D).  Also, pieces past the usual brakes, mufflers, tuneups, etc can normally be found at a local Advance Auto or similar, BUT some are dealer only peices, more than a domestic vehicle so be prepared.  Lastly, headroom.  If you are over 6'3 or so tall, INSPECT this car's headroom!  Japanese make this vehicle you know... =)

All in all, this car is very comparable to cars more than double its price.  Add to its the extreme performance and the supreme reliability, and you've got on of the best values around.
