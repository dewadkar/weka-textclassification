            Okay, I went into town today to look for the little metal clamps that hold my hubcaps onto the wheels.  First I tried the local auto parts store, and they referred me to the dealer.  After going to the dealer's, I found that no replacement clamps could be ordered, but I instead must order entirely new hubcaps at sixty bucks a pop.  No fun.  Anyway, while I was at the dealership (which happened to be Subaru, my very lifeblood) a saleswoman asked me if I was interested in a test drive.

Being only 18 years old, and not coming from a great deal of wealth, buying a new car so early in life was almost completely out of the question.  I had never taken cars for test drives, I had only dreamed about it.  After a great deal of consideration (.23 seconds) I opted to test drive an Impreza 2.5 RS, which has been my &quot;dream car&quot; if you will, since its inception.  

Settling down in the driver's seat, I found all the controls to be just a bit awkward, but after adjusting the seat and steering wheel, I was on my way.  After driving an '89 Subaru for two years, this was an experience unlike any other for me.  To begin, working the clutch was like learning all over again.  The saleswoman (who happened to be sitting in the passenger seat) informed me that in addition to being a hydraulic (as opposed to the linkage in my car) clutch, this one was of much sportier design, and was a little heavier than most.  

After getting the hang of the clutch, I proceeded to slam the gas to the floor and rocket through all five gears.  A note about the transmission: it's amazing.  Quick little &quot;clicks&quot; between each gear makes for a very satisfying and connecting experience.  To continue, the car picked up to speed with no problem, and when a police car appeared in front of us, the four massive discs had no problem bringing the speed down to a reasonable level.

Heading off the main road onto a narrow, twisting side road, I experienced firsthand the excellent suspension and handling abilities for which Subaru has become world-renound.  The low center of gravity created by the boxer engine made for some quick cornering and a comfortable ride.  Again, the brakes proved themselves when a truck in front of us suddenly decided he wanted to turn. 

Although I don't own this vehicle, and I essentially took it for a 15 minute test drive, my family has had a long history with Subarus, and has absolutely nothing bad to say about them.  This review isn't supposed to tell anybody &quot;go buy this car,&quot; because I really have absolutely nothing to compare it to.  I just took it for a drive and had a blast.  I highly recommend anybody looking for a moderately priced sporty-car with all-wheel drive to give it a test drive.  <br><br>
