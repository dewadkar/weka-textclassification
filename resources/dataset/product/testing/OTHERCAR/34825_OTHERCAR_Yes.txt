            No doubt about it: overall, this is the best vehicle I have ever owned. It handles like a sedan, accelerates with authority, rides serenely and hauls like a commercial van.

This is a nimble Conestoga. It moves through downtown Chicago like a Yellow Cab. The turning radius is amazingly tight. I am able to maneuver through the parking structure I use with greater ease than I experience with my sedan.

This is a speedy wagon as well. With it's 210 horses snorting and pulling, it gets off the line quickly, accelerates smoothly and reaches highway passing speeds in a snap.

The ride is definitely European in feel: taut, yet supple. It absorbs most irregularities with aplomb, yet transmits enough to give you a good feel for the road. There is little wind noise and no squeaks or rattles in my EX. 

It is simply but nicely appointed. Leather is not available, but the cloth seats are attractive and practical. The sound system does its job well, although the volume control on the dash is obstructed by the column  mounted gear shift when it is in drive. That is overcome by a volume and station selection control mounted on the steering wheel. The climate control system can function automatically by merely selecting a desired temperature, or it can be set manually. There is a rear panel which can also be used to control the interior climate.

One of the most delightful traits of the new Odyssey is it's cargo capacity. This is a big fella! It can carry seven adults easily. The middle seats can be arranged in a bench or individual configuration with a simple maneuver. These seats can be removed with little effort. One of the great features is the disappearing rear bench seat. It folds into a rear well so that there is no need to remove it to create more storage space. With the middle seats removed and the rear bench tucked away, the interior is truly cavernous. A standard plywood panel fits easily on the floor. I have moved easy chairs with ottomans, a bench and a desk with sounds echoing in the bowls of this big guy.

My EX comes with traction control, automatic sliding doors and a few other goodies. I purchased it at MSRP and waited about six weeks for delivery.
