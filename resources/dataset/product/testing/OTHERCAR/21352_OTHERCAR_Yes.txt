            I purchased my Camry after listening to the raves I heard from other Toyota owners over the past few years.  A friend of mine has purchased only Toyota's for the past 15 years.  Each one has lasted well over 200,000 miles.  This fact alone helped the most to convince me to purchase one.  My Camry has provided me with more than I expected from a car.  The ease of driving it, the design both inside and out is outstanding.  Lastly, the Toyota Corporation is everything that they advertise, professional, trustworthy and their employees seem to be proud  to sell something that they truly believe in.  I would, without a doubt, purchase another Toyota product.  <br><br>
