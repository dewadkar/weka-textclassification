            Mercedes Benz has long trumpeted its reputation for innovative automotive engineering. Its latest achievement is the 2001 SLK320. Beefing up the SLK280 with the old workhorse 320 engine has produced a remarkable automobile. The throaty roar as the engine winds up in each gear (yes, a six speed manual is finally available) will bring forth a wave of nostalgia to anyone who ever drove Jaguar�s XKE (when it was actually running, that is).

Another engineering miracle is the retractable hard top. I actually had friends put the top up and down while I stood to the side and admired this epitome of German engineering. Not since the 1957 Ford Sunliner has a retractable hardtop been available (the Lexus 430 was not around yet). One would think that with all of these innovations, this car would represent an outstanding sports car.

Forget it! This is definitely not a sports car! Anyone attempting to put this car through heavy cornering will soon discover this fact�occasionally too late. 

I put over 100,000 miles on a Porsche 911. I spent many happy hours winding through hills in my 911. To paraphrase Lloyd Benson, this car is no Porsche. What these Teutonic morons have done is take a basically unstable frame design, overpower it with engine, add a computerized �ESP� suspension (which has a nasty habit of taking control of the car at crucial moments), coupled it to the worst manual transmission man has ever devised and unleashed it on the driving public.

The manual transmission is so loose and sloppy that it reminded me of an old International Harvester truck I drove as a part of a summer job while in college. Of course that old workhorse never popped out of first gear while sitting at a stoplight. The SLK does that regularly and then grinds while you put it back in gear so passersby think you�ve just gotten your learner�s permit. Also the �throw range� of that transmission was considerably less than the Mercedes. 

The interior of the car is attractive. The usual Mercedes overabundance of wood (are there any trees left in the Black Forest?) lines the dash. With the top down, even the appearance of a cloud in the sky leads one to quickly put the top up. Water spots on wood are so tacky.

Given the retractable top, one would think trunk space is at a premium. Actually, with the top retracted, if one arranges things carefully, one can still fit a toothbrush and a comb in the trunk�together.

As far as reliability, mine stopped running at 110 miles. After 5 days in the shop and two different visits, I was told that a �coil� was bad. Once they got the part, it ran again.

If you want a car that looks sporty, has a retractable hardtop, costs well over $50,000.00 (with the optional sport package including AMG fenders, etc.) and bears the ubiquitous Mercedes �peace sign,� rush out and pick up the SLK. But for God�s sake be careful. Don�t ever try and drive this monster. Just sit at the curb and operate the top. Get out on a road and push this puppy and�well, I totaled mine after only three months in a head-on. No injuries to anyone (Mercedes makes a very crash-safe car�they have to).

After this experience, I went out and bought the 20001 Audi TT Quattro. Now this is a sports car. But more on that when I discuss my little TT in a future review.
