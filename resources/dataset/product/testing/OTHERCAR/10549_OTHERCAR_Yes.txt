            I bought this Mini Van because with the car we had (1988 Jeep Cherokee), we could not fit 2 children in safely &amp; with enough room. When we bought this a few months ago, my daughter was 3 months old. My son was 5 &amp; it was very hard to fit 2 car seats in our other car side by side. Compared to other cars we have owned, I LOVE THIS CAR. It fits us all in safely. We take long drives with the in-laws a lot. &amp; we can all sit safely &amp; comfortably. I wish we had this when my son was born. We had run down cars. I like the sound system in it. I like to drive this. Being higher than other cars. I like to be a little above them. I can take  the back seat out to move stuff. I can take ALL seats out if I wanted to. I can't wait until we go camping in this. Just take the back seats out &amp; sleep there. 

Now there are a couple of things I don't like. All of a sudden our service light comes on. &amp; we have a small oil leak. Also there are NO air vents in the back. (windows are not tinted). So in the summertime, the kids in the back are burning up &amp; the driver &amp; passenger are freezing. Same goes for winter. Kids are freezing, &amp; front is burning up. That flaw needs to be fixed. Also something very funny happens sometimes. If you are using the window wipers and turn the car off , they still go. You have to manually turn them off. Funny, huh? Another thing is you HAVE to clean it out every other day  or you will have your kids' rooms with you. You carry all there toys with you. It is SO roomy. 

That is all I can think of right now. 
It is a VERY nice car. We are thankful for it &amp; wouldn't trade it right now for anything.<br><br>
