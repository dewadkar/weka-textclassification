            The first car we bought as a couple was the 1996 Subaru Legacy Wagon Brighton.  We bought it for the spacious cargo area (we were wanting to go camping) and the fold down back seats.  Turns out we only used it for camping once before a car seat became a permanent fixture.

Our Subaru makes a fantastic family car.  The ride is very nice, very smooth.  The seats are buckets in front and a bench seat that allows you to flip up the seat and fold down one or both sides  in the back.  That little feature comes in very handy for moving.

Ours is a manual transmission car.  I couldn't believe it when I saw a &quot;station wagon&quot; with this feature, but I love it!  The Brighton model is the very lowest base model (I believe) so it doesn't have a lot of extras. Included are a stereo/tape player, air conditioner, front speakers, and a handy storage box between the front seats for coins, and a little deeper further back for maps, pens, and other things.

The cargo area has a separate light (as well as the regular dome light in front) that  can be on, off or work with the lift back.  It's great for a little extra light when loading or unloading things in the dark.  The lift back door also has a rear defrost and wiper/spray attachment.  The dome light takes a strange size bulb that you have to visit the auto parts store to get.

The doughnut sized spare tire is stored under the cargo area floor and is very easy to get to.  The jack is also stored under there.  There are also two small storage &quot;bins&quot; built into the sides of the cargo area.  I use them to hold spare plastic bags, thin rain slickers, jumper cables and winter extras.  These little areas may not have been built for storage (it looks like they are for changing the blinker bulbs) but they sure are handy!

The roof rack, an extra I see on most Subaru cars, is indispensable.  It has a weight limit of 100 pounds, but I've piled everything from boxes of clothes and toys (during our move 250 miles from &quot;home&quot;) to the top of my large dining room table.  Floor mats, mud flaps, bumper protectors, passenger side mirror, and more are all considered, &quot;extras&quot;.

I've had to replace the wipers once in four years.  However, if you don't buy the blade from the dealer (yikes! my pocketbook!) the replacements aren't as long as the originals.  They are easy to replace on your own in less than five minutes.

We replaced the tires once on our All Wheel Drive (AWD) Subaru in two years of city/highway driving.  The AWD engages automatically on slippery surfaces when it detects you starting to slip.  While this is a fantastic feature, it can cause a little extra slippage when it kicks in.  Until the AWD is needed, the car is front wheel drive only.  We've had the front brakes replaced once in three and a half years.

One problem with this Subaru is the rock shield on the underside of the car.  You'd think it would keep rocks out.  Nope.  Ours seems to keep rocks in no matter how many times we have it cleaned out and bent back.  We invariably hear the telltale rattle within three months of having it done.  Which was okay when the warranty covered it (I suppose...) but now that we are onto the extended warranty and the dealer isn't that thorough...

Overall, the Subaru is a fantastic, dependable car with very little maintenance needed.  It makes the perfect family car for us.  We've got two car seats in the back and will have to &quot;upgrade&quot; should we have more children, but for a smaller family it is perfect.  I heard once that you only have to change the oil regularly and a Subaru will run forever.  We'll see...<br><br>
