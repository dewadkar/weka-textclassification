            i bought this car less than a year ago (a 99 model) and it has been great so far.  it has had no problems and the drive, feel, comfort, layout, extras, and performance have all been great.  first of all, this car just looks great.  it has simple, clean cut, and slightly modern styling like that of all of the other volkswagens, especially the jetta.  it shares the same platform as the audi a4 so it has great handling and suspension.  i recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a no-frills good-looking car that is dependable but has a lot of features and comfort.  it has electric everything (windows, doors, mirrors) except power seats cost extra.  i thought that a lack of that feature might be annoying but i hardly notice it.  one other small almost unnoticable thing that i find slightly annoying is that the trunk release button is inside the glove compartment.  however, the trunk release button is hardly ever (almost never) needed since the trunk, like any other door, is unlocked when all of the other doors are unlocked, i.e., when you are in the car and would normally use the button.  i got the base trim, four cylinder turbo 1.8 liter as it has been plenty fast enough for me, but the v6 version does not cost much more if you crave more power.  i have driven much more powerful cars that have more power at lower revs, but this power is not necessary since you can just downshift into a lower gear if you need more power.  even little things like internal underside trunk handles for easy closing of the trunk (you'll have to see it) make this car great to have.  i got the car in black with black leather added, and when people see the car, they, without looking at the logo, think that it is a luxury car.  not bad for twenty grand.  with great overall performance in every category (the sound system excellent too!) including styling, performance, comfort, etc. plus the reliability of a volkswagen this car is a definite BUY.<br><br>
