            I owned a 1997 Camry CE with a five-speed. With the four cyl. engine, this car just barely gets out of it's own way. Otherwise, it was comfortable, and was for the most part very reliable. 

There were been glaring problems, though. The transmission came with a defect in third gear, which it took three years and two dealers to fix. The fix resulted in a balky, notchy feeling transmission which sometimes refuses to go into reverse, and occasionally grinds going into 4th! 

(Update: The dealer finally got it fixed after the second rebuild. They had put an incorrect retaining clip on third gear and created new problems, which they owned up to and fixed. It feels okay now, but not perfect; it's only taken four years to get it to this point!)

(Another update: At the end, the warranty was gone and the shifter started getting notchy again.)

The original windshield was defective, and my first dealer's fix was to tell me to break it with a rock and have my insurance replace it.

Finally, the suspension squeaks over bumps and dips. I'm told this is normal, but I hate that my three year old car sounds like a 15 year old Buick when it passes.

(Update: The seats have become a problem. With 60,000 miles on it, the driver's seat has become noticably less supportive, and it wasn't that great to begin with. The passenger seat is still nice and comfy; clearly the materials used in these seats is substandard.)

Now that I finally have a dealer I like, I'm beginning to like the car. I know I got a lemon, but the attitude of my first dealer and of Toyota USA when I contacted them was poor at best. I still have a car with transmission problems and a squeaky suspension, but I feel like my new dealer will try to fix things. 

(I chose a new dealer to trade this dog in for my Prius. We'll see.)

Bottom line: If my car hadn't been problem prone, I'd like it lots except for the power problem and the degrading seat quality. Now that I have a dealer I like, I would consider buying another, but not without looking at Accords, Legacies, and 626s first.
