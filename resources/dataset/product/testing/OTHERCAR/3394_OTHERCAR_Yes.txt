            The Nissan Quest is a smooth driving minivan that drives like a car.  It's seats are comfortable, and it has a very sleek design, both inside and out.  It has a V6 engine which gives it a great deal of pick up while maintaining reasonable gas mileage.  It is great if you've got small children.  I wouldn't recommend it however if you have older children such as 10 yrs old or older.
While it is more than adequate for my 6 year old, there isn't a lot of leg room in the back seat for older children.
The only thing I don't like about the van is the design of the shoulder belt for the middle seat.  While it clips to the floor so you won't trip over it, you actually have to crawl through it to get to the backseat.
Again, this hasn't been a problem for small children, but when I tried to get back there I about broke my neck.<br><br>
