            What can I say, this car is a comfortable ride.  There is a lot of impressive tweeks with a car.  Lets get started with the normal stuff first.

Brakes
The anti-lock braking was very sensitive.  One slight tap on the brake and you find your head going forward.  It brakes with great beauty once you get used to it.

Engine
Acceleration is nice and smooth like any luxury class car would be.  The feeling of changing in gears with an automatic is virtually nonexistant.

Comfort
This thing is so comfortable with it's leather and it's huge legroom both length and width wise!  I'm talking about all seats here! In the back seats there is a pull down arm rest with cup holders and a basin. The Avalon also has great suspension as you feel the slightest bump if you hit a pothole.

The Tweeks
Rear view mirror - This thing is a work of wonder.  Very high tech gadgetry is at work here.  The mirror is a normal mirror in daylight conditions, but once you turn the headlights on for evening driving, the rear view mirror tints up so to reduce the glare of the headlights of cars from behind.

In dash display - Now this is pretty techie.  The Avalon XLS model has an in dash display that displays outside/inside temperature, directional compass, fuel milage, distance left on the fuel tank, and time.

Built in garage door opener - No need for lugging around multiple garage door remotes.  On the driver side visor there are three buttons that can be programmed to your garage door motor and you can open up the garage with a press of one of the three buttons on the visor.

Accessory electrical plug - In the rear seats you can plug in anything that requires electricity into an electrical plug between the passenger and driver seats.  Great for laptops.
