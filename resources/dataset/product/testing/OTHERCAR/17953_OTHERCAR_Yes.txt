            The Jeep CJ5 - CJ8 and current Wranglers are great vehicles.  After owning two other SUVs (Ford Bronco 91, and Chevy Tahoe 98) I enjoy the Jeep.  However occasionally I see some negative feedback from Wrangler owners.  It is mainly about how the Wrangler drives and handles on the road.  
If you are going to buy a Wrangler for looks - then buy a 2WD version and get some road shocks.  Otherwise understand that it is a Short Wheel Based SUV designed for basic road and rugged off-road travel.  It will not have a quiet ride, the top comes off, so understand there will be road noise.  Jeep drivers want to feel the road under them, it is essential in technical driving.  While many Wrangler drivers add features for off-road, a standard Jeep can still do a good deal of off-roading off the dealer lot.  So, you are not going to get &quot;car-like&quot; driving, it might even seem harsh to some drivers.  The Wrangler has a short wheel base, so it takes turns more sharply and can get in and out of tight places.  You can not drive it like you are turning a 30' Cadillac.
The Jeep Wrangler is a great vehicle, but know why you want one.  If it is to look good on the road - and not for any off-roading, then maybe a 4WD Wrangler is not for you.  Of course Jeep owners will tell you that if you get a 2WD Jeep, you might as well buy a car.  They are wonderful vehicles and I have been happy with Jeep Service after the sale.  If you want a Jeep, talk to some Jeep owners - they are everywhere!
