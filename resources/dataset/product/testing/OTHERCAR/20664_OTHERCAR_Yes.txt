            So here I was with no wheels and not a lot of money, current mode of travel just ate its transmission for the second time. Looking for something that looked good, got lots of gas mileage, had room inside, and cheap to get into right away. And had to find something fast that day. 

And there it was sitting on a Toyota car lot...looking for a new home!

A nice, in great shape, used Plymouth Colt Vista 3DW with 80,000 miles under its hood. The price was a cheap $3988.00, well within my budget.
It was a one owner car, interior is in excellent shape, no body damage at all. I mean this car looked good!!! Still had that new feel to it, like it had been made just yesterday! So I bought it and gave it the new home it needed.

Now you got to keep in mind that I'm a single guy, in my mid 50's, not looking for a gas guzzling hotrod, just plain transportation, to get to work each day. And on a skateboard budget. And I like to do my own repair work. Ok, so a Toyota would have been a better car for me, but that day nothing clean and good looking was sitting at my feet.

Had the car for two days now and this is my opinion of it so far.

EXTERIOR: Good styling, got that family van look, practical, functional, simple. 

INTERIOR: For a small car it has great room for those trips to the market. Front seats lay back all the way, rear passenger seat folds forward and lock giving more cargo space plus you can remove them. Nice quite interior. Great head room, leg room both front and rear. Front seats are very comfortable and easy to get into and out of, you don't half to bend in half to get into it or get out. Very good visibility all around. No tinted windows so the optional A/C feels great and does work good. This car has that big car seating in a small car package. AM-FM radio only with a great speaker system both front and rear. No electric windows. No airbags. Tailgate lifts up and good access to back cargo area just like the more expensive vans. Side door works great, locking in the open position so it don't come sliding back on you while your getting in.

ENGINE: 1.8L, 16 valve Mitsubishi engine. 4-cyl, port fuel injection. Gets 28-29 MPG on the road with auto transmission. Its front wheel drive, which I won't hold against it. OK, so its only 113HP, but I can live with that for the gas mileage. Transmission has over drive which keeps those RPM's down and gas mileage up. Its a gutsy little engine even with two people on board!!!

Handling: Drives great. In fact I'd say its fun!! Turns very small circles due to short wheel base. Typical front wheel drive feel in the steering wheel, a little shimmy. But good steady feel to driving it. Road noise is great, ride is very good for this size car. I love driving it just wish it had the optional cruise control installed. It does take a steady foot on the gas pedal, typical 4 cyl throttle peddle throw.

Reliability: Hard to tell at this point in time other then the fact that I have it and driven it about 300 miles so far. It is 7 years old now and still looking good and in great shape, nothings rattles in it, so how it will hold up in the next 3 years still remains to be seen.

MY VERDICT: A GOOD CAR FOR THE PRICE!
Its fun to drive, cheap on gas, simple to operate, looks good, has a lot of space inside, and a quite ride. I'm sure there might be better cars out there but this is what I found given the time I had. Now if I can just find a good repair manual for it.
