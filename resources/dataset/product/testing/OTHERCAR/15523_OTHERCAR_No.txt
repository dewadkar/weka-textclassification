            Twenty five grand is the automotive null-zone when it comes to fun for anyone who needs four real seats. Sure, you can saddle up a pretty nice Camry or Accord for that price. Well built, comfortable, quiet. But unless your idea of fun is accidentally starting the car when it's already running, there's not much to raise the pulse.

This was the dilemma facing us when it came time to replace my aging Subaru. In our town, the Subaru dealer is also the Chrysler franchise, and during the Suby's final death throes I'd had occasion to wander the lot while the service department performed trauma surgery.

Although I hated to admit it, the new Chryslers look really good. Not a landau roof or a Lebaron nameplate in sight. But with the exception of a '68 Barracuda I owned in highschool, I'd been a Japanese believer all the way. Chrysler quality? It was an oxymoron in my book.

And so, while last rites were being administered to the Suby's transmission, I met a lovely Sebring JXi in the parking lot. Truth be known, I was comforted by the fact that Mitsubishi built her powerplant, and I wasn't bothered by the fact that some of their engineering may have found their way under the sexy skin.

Asthetically, this is a knock-out car. Very upscale and graceful. Looks good with the top in either position. And for $25k, fully dressed. V6, auto, leather, reasonably realistic plastic wood accents, alloy wheels, Infinity CD player, security system, ABS, traction control, Homelink system, keyless entry, power trunk opener and power everything else. 

It's a surprisingly big car, too. With room for four adults and a real trunk. The ride is reasonably solid, especially for a ragtop, and the roof features an interior headliner and a real glass rear window. Operation is simple and quiet, which is good, because we're always making red-light decisions to &quot;take the lid off&quot; as my three year old, Ben, says.

The buying experience was pretty good, too. Chrysler seems to really appreciate the business. There were over $2000 in incentives on the car, and they let me take it for an afternoon to see if we really liked it. 

On the down side, even with the V6, performance is not stellar, and gas mileage is average to poor. I'd suggest the &quot;slap-stick&quot; transmission option if you can find it. Build quality is still sub-Japanese, but not by a margin worth concern. The dashboard could use some refinement (It's borrowed from the platform twin Cirrus/Stratus and is out-classed in this car).

The lovely leather seats have bottom bolsters that feel a little short for adequate support, and the recline mechanism feels flimsy. Variable power assist on the steering gives too light a feel for my taste.

However, on a warm night, with the top down and the CD player cranking, all is forgiven. We've only got 600 miles on the car now. I'll let you know how we feel at 15 and 30k. But for now, we're in love.

****************************************************************
With 5k on the odometer I felt it was time for an update. The car has actually gotten more comfortable with age. The seats and suspension have softened to a just-right level. I originally rated the performance as lackluster but in retrospect I had just traded in a highly powered Subaru SVX and pretty much anything but a Vette would have seemed weak. Having lived with the car for a few months the power is actually pretty good.

Build quality is still not an issue, although a rattle sometimes creeps up in the roof/side window junction. Whatever they make the mirror housings out of (glossy black plastic) tends to get clouded up and I can't figure out why.

I felt the Infinity audio system lacked punch, especially with the top down, so I installed a high end system with a powered subwoofer in the trunk...problem solved.

Driving this car with the top down has developed into a sort of mini-spa treatment for my wife and I. A couple of times a week one of us will sneak it out for a couple hours and come back feeling very relaxed and really cool. We'll check back in at 10k or so.

7k Update (9 mos old)

Okay, we don't drive much. The Sebring's a second car to our more versatile but infinitely duller minivan. Anyway, as expected, some of the gloss is off the lily (is that a mixed metaphor?). Around the 5k mark, the transmission decided it was done shifting. The dealer was a real sport though, and gave us a free rental car even though we didn't have the coverage. They had it fixed the same day (bad speed relay. Not a burp since.)

Last week, the top decided it wasn't convertible anymore. I opened the hood and thumped the fuse panel a couple of times and it came back. Very reassuring. By the way, the top uses some high ampere gear...standard fuses don't fit...so I'd have a spare or two of the big ones in the glovebox.

The car's downmarket interior components aren't aging well, especially the carpeting. I once worked at a car rental lot, and I must have vacuumed ten thousand Dodge Shadows in my day. Trust me when I tell you, this is the same crappy, thin cardboard carpeting, and it's hard to keep it looking nice, even with the crappy, thin cardboard floormats.

Still, much like my first wife, when you take the top off, suddenly you like it a lot better. Yesterday afternoon, clear skies and mid 70's we took the Sebring on a long drive down an old two laner. Wind in the hair, stereo thumping, rock solid at 70mph. I didn't think about the carpet once.

**************************************************************************
Update at 9k miles (11 mos old)

Well, the interior certain hasn't gotten any nicer since the last update.And this car is babied, with a full wash and interior vacuum every other fill-up. In fact the sun has discolored some of the panels in the leather seats so they no longer match their neighbors. I wonder if it's Genuine Corinthian after all. The roof seals are starting to fail. A trip to the self serve drive-in car wash requires keeping a sponge in your lap, however it still stays dry in your basic rainstorm. Some interesting new squeaks and rattles have manifested themselves, and I imagine more will come.

The big news is, it's back in the shop for the tranny again. You'll recall at 5k it stopped upshifting from first. Lately it won't engage reverse. This does not bode well at a measly 9,000 miles. I leased this car, so everything is under warranty, but I would caution anyone against buying the car as a long term prospect. Realistically, it's a Stratus dressed up for the prom. Take it out, have some fun, but bring it back early and for God's sake, don't marry the damn thing.


***********************************************************************
Update @ 12k

Probably the most telling thing about the car is the fact that we've owned it for a year and a half and have put a measly 12k miles on it. Fact is, this just isn't our first choice for transportation so it sits in the garage while we tool around in my wife's Montero. Meanwhile, my cat has taken up residence on the roof and deposited so much hair the car looks like it's wearing a wig. No major repair or wear issues to report however. At this point I'm biding my time for the lease to expire. If Chrysler does what I expect it to do and offers up some decent incentives at lease-end to take a new one, I have my eye on the new Sebring coupe. That car is pretty much a new-generation Mitsubishi Eclipse. I think the only actual Chrysler part is that little winged emblem on the steering wheel, which I imagine I'll have some sort of trouble with shortly after taking delivery.
