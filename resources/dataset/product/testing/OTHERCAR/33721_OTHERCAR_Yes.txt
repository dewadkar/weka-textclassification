            When you have a model that is identical to another- in this case, the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, why not go ahead and buy the model you are more comfortable with?  In my case, I would opt for the Ford Contour, which I actually do own, and I have found very reliable in the 3 years I have owned it.  The Mercury Mystique is the same car for the same money.  What needs to be considered is the service that comes with it.  If you've heard great things about the service at the Mercury place, go with that one.  If the Ford place offers the best service, then go with the Ford.  Don't be fooled into thinking they're any different.  Same car, same reliability, same quality- and most places are Ford/Mercury anyway, so you're going to get the same service.

So basically, a comparison between the Contour and Mystique is useless.
