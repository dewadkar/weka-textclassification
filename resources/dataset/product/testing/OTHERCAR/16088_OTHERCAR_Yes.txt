            Up until 2 months ago, our Ford Expedition served as the mini-bus for our small, active family. When the lease ran out on the Ford after 3 terrific years, we had to go through the dreaded car shopping experience. 

Thru our search, which ranged from every S.U.V. possible and even some mini-vans. The Jeep Grand Cherokee ended up on the top of our list, and we haven't regret it since. 

The 2000 Grand Cherokee is one of the most luxurious cars on the road, combining a high power engine for the men, and luxurious comfort for all. The Jeep also comes equipped with a high quality sound system, that can make driving through rush hour traffic a breeze. The front bucket seats provide more than enough support for all areas of your back and body, leaving no part unattended with a comfortable backing. 

The Jeep has been nothing but good for us, and we use it constantly. It has been able to withstand the rigorous schedule it takes to move this family around, so I'm sure it would be more than welcome in your family.<br><br>
