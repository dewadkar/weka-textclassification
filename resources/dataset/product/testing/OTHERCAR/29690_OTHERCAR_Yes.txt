            I bought a Turquoise 1990 Plymouth Colt 3dr in July 1990. I had just graduated from High School and was looking to replace my 1978 Toyota Corolla SR-5 Liftback (That was the most fun on four wheels). I needed something cheap. At $6066 this car fit the bill. By the way the current model (2000 Mitsubishi Mirage Coupe) is double that for the same car.

It was a base model with no options. When I say no options I mean no options. It did not have any of the following: cigarette lighter, radio, speakers, rear defogger, power steering, etc. It did come with a 1.5L four cylinder engine and a 5-speed transmission. The car is actually a Mitsubishi, the only Plymouth and or Chrysler markings on the car were the Plymouth Colt on the front an back and the Mopar battery. Even the key said Mitsubishi. I had the dealer install a AM/FM/Cassette and two small speakers when I bought it.

I currently have 84,000+ miles on this car. It has been a trooper. In the first six months I wore the tread off of the factory Michelins in only 6,000 miles. If you�re 18 and the clutch is good you can really smoke the tires! Next it sat for 6 months while I was in Marine Corps Boot Camp and training schools. Then I sold it to my sister. She was not easy on it. She had two accidents, one on each front corner and was always rough on the clutch. Then with about 60,000 miles on it I took it back in the summer of 1998 when she moved on to a Chevy Tahoe.

Since then I have put new front axles, a new clutch, a new timing belt, fan belt, thermostat, cap and rotor, tires, and a radio and speakers into this car. This may sound like a lot of work but it was all original equipment. Yes I had 83,000 miles on one cap and rotor and fan belt. Overall I have put $3,000 dollars into this car in the last two + years for gas, insurance, maintenance, and repairs. That works out to about $110 a month and falling. Not a bad cost of ownership.

This car is small and Spartan but it is still pretty fun to drive and reliable. I still get mileage in the upper 20s and my insurance is only about $30 a month. The interior is vinyl and has not held up well but it is good, reliable transportation. I don�t have any rust but the clear coat is coming off a little on the front left fender.

I have topped out at 97mph on the open road and the car handles well. My only regret is that I did not get a rear defogger because it is very helpful in the Denver area.

If you can find one of these that is in good shape you can count on it to be a reliable and economic transportation car. I think the current bluebook is about $1,000 to $1,800. If you are looking at one worry more about the mechanical than the looks as it is now just a transportation car.
