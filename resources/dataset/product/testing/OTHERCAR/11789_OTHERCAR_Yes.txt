            The Casio Exilim EX-M2 is one cool camera.  Granted, it&#146s not even close to the highest resolution available but the pictures are fine for emailing or printing 4x6 prints.  You can even get away with 8x10 if you are going to put the prints in a frame.  The biggest selling point for me was of course, the size of the camera.  I have been looking for a camera small enough to put in my pocket without it being annoying.  The Exilim fits the bill perfectly.  If fact, I doubt if they could make it much smaller and have it still be usable.  My previous camera was a Canon Digital Elf.  A small camera by most standards, but not small enough for me.  I was too much of a bother to carry it around.  The Exilim, in contrast, is never far from me.  There is absolutely no reason for me to leave behind.  Which has come in handy on more than one occasion.  Impromptu pictures are the best in my opinion.

As you probably know, the EX-M2 is basically an EX-S2 with added sound capability.  This makes the camera slightly larger than the S2 but I think the added size is justified.  The movie clips without sound would not be nearly as much fun.  I have not used the MP3 playback capability at all.  I have an iPod for that.  The movie clips are low resolution (320x240) and limited to 30 seconds a piece.  Not a lot of time, but you can catch some pretty funny clips in 30 seconds.  Especially when the people you are shooting are expecting you to take a picture.  

The camera is well made and very sturdy.  The metal casing appears to be able to take a beating.  My biggest gripe is the lack of any kind of lens cap or carry case.  The lens is always exposed and I suppose it could get scratched easily.  I make sure not to put anything else in the same pocket as the Exilim, and I have ordered the leather case from Casio ($19.99).  

The pictures are surprisingly good considering the fixed focus lens.  Not quite as sharp as the Canon Elf but the colors and levels were actually a little better.  Since I email most of my pictures I end up having to reduce them anyway, so any advantage the Elf had in sharpness is pretty much negated.  It should be noted though, the Exilim is not a true 2.1 Megapixel camera.  It&#146s highest actual resolution is 1280x960.  It achieves 1600x1200 through internal software manipulation.  A fact I was not aware of prior to buying the camera. I would have still gotten the camera but I think Casio should indicate this fact on the box.

I considered the Minolta D&#146Image X but the size difference between it and the Canon Elf I already had was not sufficient enough to justify switching.  The D&#146Image does have a 3X optical zoom, something the Exilim lacks.  I just move closer to my subject to compensate for this but an optical zoom would be nice.  The digital zoom should be avoided if at all possible.  All it does is blow up the pixels in the center, something you could do better in your photo editing software.  

All in all, I am very happy with the camera. My friends cannot believe how small it is.  Every one that sees it wants one.  If you need a good go-anywhere fun camera, the Exilim is a great choice.  If you need true 2.1 MP picture and an optical zoom the Elf or D&#146Image are probably a better choice.
