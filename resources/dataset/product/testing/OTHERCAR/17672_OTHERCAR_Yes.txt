            The Mercury Cougar 2000

Feline Good

Mercury calls the 2002 Cougar a "New edge styling" for the new Millennium, which balances this sleek look, with the aerodynamic design and with clean intersecting lines, unlike any other car on the road today. 

I agree that the design is quite out of the ordinary but I differ from Mercury's claim to its uniqueness. I think that this claim is a little bit too strong, I have seen other cars from different manufacturers that also have a new high tech look. 

As high tech does the exterior of the Cougar looks as ordinary does the interior of this Mercury sport coupe is. Now this does not mean that it is inferior in any way but when you see the outer body of the Cougar one would expect some new age design for the interior also. 

The driver side console is very practical, all gages are easy to see when sitting in the driver's seat and all controls can easily be reached. I found that sitting in the rear seats can be a bit tight for a larger adult but it should be comfortable enough for children. 

The split fold-down design of the rear seats will help with the loading and transporting of equipment and luggage. The Cougar comes with an excellent sound system, the rental car I drove even had the CD player option and it sounded great.

The exterior of the Cougar will give you a sophisticated, high tech new design look. Both the headlights and the rear tail lights shapes add to the sleek and aerodynamic shape of the Cougar. The hatchback rear door is mounted with a spoiler, which with the 16 inches aluminum wheels add to the sporty look of the Cougar. 

On The Road:

Driving this car was quite enjoyable. The car hugs the road and offers a very comfortable ride. If there is one thing negative about the way the Cougar handles on the road is that I found it a bit too noisy. But aside from that, highway and city driving was a pleasure. 

Under The hood:

The Mercury Cougar I drove was equipped with a V-6 engine DOHC that develops 170 horse power. The transmission was an automatic 4-speed  overdrive transmission. It also had 4 wheel disc brakes. 

The car I drove was a Citrus Metallic Gold exterior with a beautiful interior in Medium Parchment. This color scheme may sound unusual but it does match with this car Millennium design.
