            There are fewer and fewer downright uncompetitive vehicles. However, the Mitsubishi Outlander is one of them. Even though Mitsubishi is very late to the compact SUV fray, it failed to learn from the competition. For some time now Mitsubishi has sold vehicles by offering heavy incentives and easy credit. Based on the Outlander, this isn&#146t going to change soon.

<b>Styling and Accommodations</b>

From most angles the exterior styling is passable, even pleasantly sporty. The <b><a href="/content_48420392580">Honda CR-V</a></b> is a generic boring box in comparison, and the Toyota RAV4 looks like a toy. (Click on a hyperlink to go to my reviews of related vehicles.) Unfortunately, Mitsubishi has decided to make its products stand out through bizarre styling. (I think of them as the Japanese Pontiac.) In the Outlander, the bizarre part is Mitsubishi&#146s new pointy-nosed front end. 

Inside I found the Outlander more pleasing to the eye. The silver-faced instruments and silver trim panel sweeping across the dash (in the XLS) provide an interesting contrasst to the dark two-toned leather. The materials are of good quality. If a cut below those in the Honda and Toyota, they are significantly better than those in a <b><a href="/content_76092968580">Ford Escape</a></b>. 

There is adequate room in the front and rear seats for adults (though the Honda has substantially more rear legroom). Visibility is very good, as expected in this type of vehicle. (Many people buy SUVs for their high seating positions.) The rear seat is high enough off the floor to provide decent thigh support. As in other SUVs, the rear seat folds to expand the cargo area. The Outlander&#146s cargo volume is a bit less than the class norm, but still usefully large. Overall, this SUV delivers in terms of utility.

<b>On the Road</b>

Where the Outlander fails is &#147sport.&#148 In the otherwise disappointing <b><a href="/content_69727456900">Galant</a></b> I found Mitsubishi&#146s 140-horsepower, 2.4-liter engine smooth for a four-cylinder and adequately strong. In the heavier Outlander, this engine feels VERY weak&#151perhaps the weakest I&#146ve driven recently in a non-hybrid&#151and sounds buzzy and strained. I can't believe this is the same engine I praised for smoothness in the Galant. By itself it renders the Outlander uncompetitive. 

Mitsubishi promises another twenty horses for 2004, which should help. A V6 would be better, but I&#146ve read that one will not fit in the engine compartment and thus one will not be available until the Outlander is redesigned. What were they thinking?

Aside from the engine, performance is fairly good for a compact SUV. Though the steering is a bit too light, the Outlander feels agile and leans moderately (for an SUV) in turns. It rides comfortably. Wind and road noise levels are low enough to put all that engine noise front and center. 

<b>Pricing</b>

The loaded Outlander I drove listed for $24,470. According to Edmunds, the typical discount and a $500 rebate brings this to about $22,300. This price includes heated leather seats, a sunroof, and an Infinity sound system. (No CD changer, though.)

A <b><a href="/content_48420392580">Honda CR-V</a></b> EX is equipped much like the vehicle I drove minus the $1,450 &#147luxury package&#148 (heated leather and a few knick-knacks). It lists for $22,860, and dealers tend to knock off about a grand. Comparably equipped, the Honda will cost about $900 more. If you want leather, though, it&#146s not available on the Honda this model year. The Honda is not styled as well, but performs better, feels more solid, and is larger inside. Overall, it&#146s well worth the extra cash if you can do without leather. You can always go the aftermarket route.

My personal favorite compact SUV is the <b><a href="/content_75828137604">Subaru Forester</a></b>. It is a bit tighter inside than the Outlander, much less the CR-V, but handles much more like a car. Easily the most fun to drive of the bunch. The interior is also top-notch. Sadly, the price is high: a $26,170 sticker for a leather model (leather requires all options) that drops to about $24,000 with the typical discount. Zero percent financing is available, but no rebate. So about $1,700 more than the Mitsubishi.

A <b><a href="/content_78752157316">Saturn VUE</a></b> equipped like a loaded Outlander lists for $24,430, and supposedly dealers don&#146t discount. A $2,000 rebate brings the cost about even. Between these two, I&#146m not sure what I&#146d do. I haven&#146t driven a four-cylinder VUE, but engine performance should be a bit better than the Mitsubishi&#146s. Rear seat comfort and interior quality are worse.

All in all, the Mitsubishi will cost less than most of the competition. But there&#146s a reason for this.

<b>Last Words</b>

The Outlander is good enough that it&#146s a shame a weak engine ruins the vehicle. Aside from the front end, the styling is better than most. The space inside is adequate while ride and handling are competitive. But the engine is just awful in this application. I&#146d buy something else.
