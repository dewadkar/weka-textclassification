            As promised, I am sharing my opinion on this little mini van, and how it rates on long trips.  I have 2 to relate to you, so buckle up, and enjoy the ride.

The first trip came as a surprise, about a month ago.  Due to an airline foul up, I had the choice of letting my kids sit at O'Hare for ten hours, or they could fly to a &quot;local&quot; hub, 200 miles away.  We chose the local hub, and I flew up the turnpike in my Voyager.  Wow!  This baby hydroplanes, and you can feel it.  Nice for those of us who suffer from lead foot, and don't want to do ourselves in.  Great ride, long trip, no problems.

The second trip was about ten days later.  The move of 600 miles, in which the luggage rack was loaded, there were ten potted plants in the back, a frog in a tank, two cats, three dogs, two passengers and a driver.  I know, I am nuts!  
We loaded the day before as much as possible, and got an early start.  The cats and dogs were medicated, and off we went.  The difference between this car and the VW I used to drive is awesome.  We all had room, even when the luggage came into the car because the stupid tarp was shredding in the west Texas headwind.  We were all comfortable, and I had pick up going up hill, fully loaded.  I could see oncoming traffic and react in an appropriate manner, and when the drive was done, I could walk.  I have some arthritis that makes road trips somewhat painful, so bot being crippled at the end of the day was delightful.
A few drawbacks, high cost of gas to low mileage, high profile that does catch the wind, my son's ability to rock the whole van as he jiggles his feet...  On the whole, I would rate it as a very positive experience.

I will do more road trips in this vehicle.  It is comfortable, I didn't feel pressured to use or avoid the cruise control, and the trip wasn't the ordeal I had anticipated.  I guess our next big adventure will be teaching my daughter to drive.<br><br>
