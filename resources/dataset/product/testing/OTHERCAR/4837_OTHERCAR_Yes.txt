            Well, I am back with another auto review. I recently had the opportunity to drive my Mother�s 1999 LHS. WOW! I know this has to be one of the most fabulous autos ever built. From the classic interior design to the eye-catching, head turning style of the exterior. 

I want to begin outside. The exterior styling is grand and nothing on the road compares to it. I do have a few complaints, but that is to be expected with almost anything. I want to say the front of the vehicle is awesome. This car would look good in a 65 or 25 year olds driveway. The headlamps are gorgeous and really illuminate at night thanks to the directional �eyeball� shaped lenses. Don�t break one for they are quite pricey. The back-up lights are bright enough to blind someone behind the car.

The interior is spacious and needs little care to maintain the Royale leather seats and trim. The LHS features a 240 watt Infinity Spatial Imaging sound system and an optional 360 watt Infinity sound as well. Go with the latter. With the bun warmer seats and 10-way power adjust, you can settle in as either the driver or passenger in ultimate comfort. 

As far as ride quality is concerned, I would have to say it is almost orgasmic. It is so smooth and soft you feel as if you are riding on a cloud of air. There is nothing surprising about the highway feel of the car. The only complaint about the car is the handling at speeds over 85. I have no problem opening a car up, but this one shimmied over 92. I had the LHS up to 119 before the governor kicked in. The car shook a little too much for a vehicle with 17� tires. 

Overall, I think the craftsmanship is superb and not to be taken lightly! Happy motoring.
