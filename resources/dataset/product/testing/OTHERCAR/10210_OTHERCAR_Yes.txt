            My family was probably one of the first to buy the then-new 1999 RX300 back in September of 1998.  I remember my father saying how people were always asking him what kind of car this was.  And it is a pretty svelte looking vehicle as far as SUVs are concerned.  Back then it was curvier than practically all the other SUV offerings around.  And it still is a very good looking vehicle.  My father liked this car _so_ much that he went and leased another one 1 month later and left the first one to me to drive (and pay off).  Now I'm not particularly fond of SUVs since I think they're generally a waste of metal that no suburban family _really_ needs but usually gets as a status symbol.  They're gas-guzzlers, they're not exactly environment-friendly, and in case of an accident they're a bigger threat to people in regular cars.  If you just need to get around, buy a car.  You need more trunk space, get a station wagon.  You're a soccer mom, get a family van.  You need to off-road through the forest to get to work, get an SUV.  How many people out there with SUVs actually go off-roading?  A very tiny percentage I'm sure.

But, I'm a driver who likes to be able to see _down_ the road that I'm on.  And with the number of SUVs trundling around these days, it's close to impossible to see anything past the vehicle in front of you if you're in a normal car since chances are, the vehicle in front of you will be a jacked up SUV.  So the only way to see anything on the road these days is if you were in something SUV-sized or above.  It sucks, but until small cars come back into vogue (which I doubt since we're in the "the bigger the better" US of A), there's not much that can be done.

Anyway, as for the Lexus RX300 itself, it's a pretty nice vehicle.  The only dimension where it's significantly larger than a normal car is its height.  It's actually shorter front to back than my parent's old Mercedes-Benz 300E sedan which is a small/mid-sized car to begin with.  And it's not much wider (if at all) than a normal sedan.  It's just basically perched higher on its big wheels than a normal car.

The leather interior is very comfortable and spacious.  The seats are nice and cushy but no position memory.  I have the earliest model which lacks the gizmos that the newer models can pack but even so, it's very functional.  You got 4 cup holders which is pretty handy and enough storage space up front for change, notepad, and whatnot.  Someone wrote in their review that their seat warmers only had one toggle which activated both seats instead of having individual toggles for each seat and that's the way it is on mine as well _but_ apparently the individual toggles were an extra option since the 1-month newer version that my father later got has the individual toggles.  I have the 6CD changer in the glove compartment which is very handy and the sound system works great.  The interior seems quiet enough during normal driving conditions but I'm more prone to fast driving and I'm not exactly sure how fast one should go and still expect no "blowing wind" sound effects.  The center display screen displaying sound system and air conditioning settings is very nice and large so that you can see what you need to see at a glance.

The vehicle handles pretty well which shouldn't be surprising since it's not all that big.  Kinda like driving a large sedan around.  It's got a pretty clippy V6 engine with good acceleration.  The brakes may feel a little soft at first but not as bad as some others I've driven before.  The all wheel drive is nice during snow days.  It's got an approximately 16 gallon tank which usually lasts me almost 250 miles.  The ride isn't as smooth as being in a Lexus sedan but it's still pretty good for what it is.

Overall the RX300 is actually a pretty decent vehicle.  It's not something you should take into a metropolitan city (especially since parking garages are charging SUV owners an extra $10 minimum just for having an SUV) on a daily basis but it's pretty comfortable for a medium or long haul.  It's solidly-constructed and well-designed and I'm sure the new models have long done away with whatever flaws I've missed.  A good purchase if you _really_ have to have an SUV.
