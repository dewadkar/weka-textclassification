            I bought my 98 Isuzu Rodeo pre-owned. It was only about 6 months old and I have now owned it for one year. It's got 31,000 on it. It is a standard. I really love it but I have to admit the automobile is a bit too bouncy for me. I am in sales so I drive around the city alot. New Orleans is flat, but the roads are terrible so with each pot-hole and bump i go over the car seems to over exagerate bouncing up and down. This has caused tension in my back area by the end of the day and I usually am not the one offering to do any extracurricular driving.

As far as mileage goes it gets 20 miles to the gallon when the A/C is off, and much less when it is on.

Saftey wise I have been hit twice, rear-ended and sideswiped, in the last year and I have walked away unscathed. It is a very sturdy automobile. The Isuzu service center on the other hand sucks. Getting parts for the vehicle from our service center is very very very slow. 

The room in the car is good. Both my husband and myself are tall and we travel with a 14 year old boy and his guitar quite a bit and there is room for everyone. 

The trunk is kind of funny to open, you have to put the key in the button, turn it, *take the key out*, then push to open. It wont open if you push it with the key still in.

Its got two cup holders up front, two in back, an extra cigarette lighter to put your cellphone or c.d. adapter in which I find extremely convienient!
 
Overall it feels solid on the road and is great fun for long distance driving!
