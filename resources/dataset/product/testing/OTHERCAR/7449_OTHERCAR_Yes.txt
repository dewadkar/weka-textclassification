            My Grand Am was my first new car.  Little did I know that a year after I bought it, I would marry into a family of four.  What is my only complaint about this car?  The size.  It is not a roomy car.  Don't get me wrong, for a road trip, there is room enough for the driver and a couple of passengers.  But for a family of five - with luggage - good luck.  

The trunk might seem roomy enough, for a single person that is.  Now that I have a stroller, I am lucky to fit much more than that back there!  I must say, I might be a little spoiled, for our other car is an Expedition.  But I just don't think my little Pontiac has very much leg room.  For those people with children, this would be the &quot;he's touching me; she's too close to me; I can't sleep&quot; vehicle.  You might be okay if you have two little ones, but three would be much too crowded.  I had a lot of trouble fitting my son's car seat into the back seat of this car, as well.  

Now for the good points... I have had my car for four years now and have only had to get new brake pads, replace the alternator, and replace the battery.  Most of that was covered under its warranty.  My out of pocket expense has been close to nothing.  There was a problem with the adjuster for the driver's side mirror, which the shop had to work on shortly after I bought the vehicle (The problem was the adjuster fell inside the door, making it very difficult to use!).  I was told this was still a problem in the next year's model.  Hopefully, this has been improved.  My car handles very well, and it drives like a little race car.  I got the GMAC Smart Buy/Lease option, which meant only 3.9% interest and the option to turn it in after three years and owe nothing.  As you can tell, I like my car because I still have it!

This is a good first car, as my payments were low ($230) and it is dependable.  I think many families with little ones might feel a bit cramped.  Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase of the Grand Am.  <br><br>
