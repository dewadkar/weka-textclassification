            I got this car by default after getting married.  My car was dying, so I got my wife an Acura and I started driving the old 1988 Honda CRX DX in 1996.

My wife had owned this car since it was new and she always had great things to say about it.  Now that I have been driving it for a few years, I find it extremely economical, fun and useful.  

I now drive it 95 miles one way to work! On good runs I get about 45 miles to the gallon while commuting!  Long trips I get 50 MPG!

The car is quick, easy to shift, and fun to drive.  The cargo area can hold a lot of stuff.  I have jammed it full of all kinds of things.  

If something ever happened to my car, I would try and buy another one, even though they do not make them anymore.

GET THIS CAR if you have a long commute, like small cars and you do not mind the low ride feel.  Not a family car (no back seat at all).  The DX that I have is plenty quick, the HF model is slower but better on gas, lastly, the Si model is the fastest and not as good on gas.
