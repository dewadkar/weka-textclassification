            I rented a 1999 Pathfinder for the Christmas holidays in 1999 to drive to our primitive cabin in the Assinaboine River Valley in Manitoba.  Previous years I drove my 1989 Ford 3/4 ton passenger van.  Every year my fiance and I spent hours every time we went out in winter digging the van out of the snow.  The van would get stuck in just inches of snow.  After a surprise snowstorm on the Easter long weekend in last year, we towed the van out of the valley with our snowmobile.  Needless to say we rented a 4Wd because I refused to drive the van to the cabin between October and May.

The Pathfinder's performance in 4WD was great.  It started snowing the day we left and I was confident and secure about the trip.  Gas mileage was great.  Of course we had to try the back roads and the handling was good on washboard gravel roads although we did feel like we were riding in a truck.

We did find the heat very hard to regulate and in Canada in winter this is an important feature.  The headrests made rear visibility poor and it was difficult to keep the rear window clear.  As smokers we found the ashtray mounted between the front seats very awkward especially since we were wearing heavy winter jackets that kept getting in the way.  It wasn't very roomy in the front either when we had our heavy jackets on.

If I won a new Pathfinder, I'd take it but I wouldn't buy one.<br><br>
