            I consider the Dakota Quad Cab 4X4 to be the ideal vehicle.  It has the guts of a pick-up truck coupled with the comfort of a luxury car.  I have had my truck for about 2 and a half years (42000 miles) and have never regretted my original decision to purchase the truck.  Why did I buy it?

I liked the large interior...I and all my friends are 6 feet and over and nobody complains about leg-room.

I liked the ride-height...in this truck, I can see everything that is going on around me.

I liked that it was larger and tougher than the average car...the truck was rear-ended resulting in a bent bumper (no body damage) - the other car was totaled.

I liked the reasonable overall height...I can drive into any underground parkade (fits under 6.5 feet)

I liked the feel of driving it...it is long and seems to glide over the road bumps.  The suspension is smooth for a 4X4...not at all bouncy.

On all these points, I was not disappointed.  However, some issues have arisen that detract somewhat from the overall satisfaction.  Although there is no noticeable weakness in the operation of the brakes, they do not seem to be able to handle non-ideal braking conditions.  Driving on hills or off-road regularly will warp the rotors rather easily.  You can look forward to brake-work every 10000 miles or so.  This seems to be the case for many owners if the opinions on the internet are any indication.  Also, the motor requires excessive maintenance (in my humble opinion).  The throttle body is prone to varnishing from fuel additives.  There is a component inside the throttle body that controls the idle so a rough running engine will result if no maintenance is done (every 10-15 thousand miles).  The motor is also prone to carbon build-up over time.  The tolerances in the motor are so precise that a small amount of build-up causes engine knocking and pinging as well as a significant loss of power.  You will need a de-carbonizing service every 30000 miles or so.  Finally, there is no convenient front access to the frame of the truck.  It is impossible to mount load-bearing accessories without cutting into the front valance which hangs well below the level of the frame.

Overall, I love my truck.  I have accepted the engine maintenance requirements as par for owning any newer model vehicle.  Although the brakes are a regular concern (and cannot be modified due to space limitations around the wheel), the rest of the truck more than makes up for the shortcoming.
