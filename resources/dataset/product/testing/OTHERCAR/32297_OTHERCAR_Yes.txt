            When we got pregnant with our first child we wanted a safer car so we went hunting.  We test drove fords, saturns and numerous other cars before the nissan sentra.  None had the pickup that the sentra had.  Very roomy, comfortable seats, it had everything we wanted and the price was reasonable.  It proved its safety when my husband had a wreck in it, he was not hurt at all.  We even bought a second one.  It has many options, remote keyless entry, which is very handy with a toddler.  It comes with a cd player and a rear defroster.  The only problem we have found is it is not as roomy as we first though, not a good car for someone with more than two children.  In all, I really love this car!!<br><br>
