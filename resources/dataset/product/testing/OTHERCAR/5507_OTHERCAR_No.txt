            I bought this vehicle in 1994 with 28,000 miles on it for $8000.  In 95 I had to replace a head gasket which costs $500.  I have replaced the brakes several times which is not a cheap price either.  Just recently I have had to replace the heater core, upper and lower radiator hoses, and last but not least head gasket.  Now I understand it is older and has $110,000 miles on it now but I talked with the mechanic that changed out the heater core and he stated to me that the head gasket on my engine 2.0 is notorious for seeping and needs to be replaced.  He said he sees it on almost every chevy cavalier with this engine, people don't notice it until a major problem.  It looks damp around the head.  It just seems to me that it was a good little car while it was in its newer days but now it just is my money pit.  This month alone to repair has cost me a total of over $1,000. If I would've known in the beginning of the month of all the repair I would've got another vehicle.  Just everything started one after the other.   Also, it still is in need of more but don't have the funds to do it.  Blower motor is still in need of replacing but Ill due with the cold. <br><br>
