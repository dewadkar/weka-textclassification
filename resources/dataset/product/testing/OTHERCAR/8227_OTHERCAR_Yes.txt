            My family has owned a red 1984 Mercedes 190E since 1993.  It has changed hands three times, and has survived an accident that nearly totaled it.  This vehicle is my first, and I love.  Here's why: It's a Mercedes.  Nothing like a Mercedes! It has lasted 17 years.  It has great pick-up, which makes highway merging less of a nightmare.  It handles well.  The brake pedal and gas pedal are firm, not sensitive.  It gets about 24 miles to the gallon.  I would not recommend this car for family use, for the back seat can get a little cramped.  However, it is perfect for a young person who doesn't cart around lots of people at once.  It is affordable, obviously, since it is older, but it has a great vintage vibe to it.  I would highly recommend the Mercedes 190E!
