            I read a review on this very site, several reviews actually and they convinced me to purchase this camera.  I went to my local Circuit City and bought the camera plus an extra 64meg SD card.  The camera cost me $209.  They only had two left.

I purchased the camera because I wanted one to take with me to the Detroit auto show and I also figured I would get plenty of use out of it elsewhere.  After taking several pictures of the cars at the show, I was amazed at the quality.  My friends both had Sony cameras and they said mine was by far the best of the bunch, also the cheapest.  This surprised them, they had never heard of a Panasonic digital camera and figured their Sony's would be better.  The movie quality the camera takes surprised me.  I was expecting really poor choppy movies, but the camera proved me wrong.

The battery life on the camera is not too good, but I hear all digital cameras eat batteries.  I bought some rechargeables to help cost over the long run.  I advise everyone to do so.  The included 16meg SD memory seems a little too small.

Ok, now the drama...I downloaded all my car pictures to my computer and everything worked great.  I went to check out the burst picture option on the camera (the one where it takes many pictures real quick back to back) and the camera shut off.  I figured this to be the batteries running out.  So I replaced them...and the camera was still dead.  Replaced them again to no avail.  I was pretty damn mad to put it nicely.  I had to drive 45 minutes to the nearest Circuit City to replace the thing.  They only had one left, so I was lucky.  I only had the camera for a weekend, one F#$% weekend and it crapped out on me.  I figured I just got a bad camera, and now my new camera hasn't failed...yet.  I read reviews on another site about other Panasonic cameras crapping out, but after a year's worth of use.  This is a great camera, but the build quality is highly questionable.  I didn't drop mine or mistreat it, in fact I took extra special care of it since I just purchased it.

Bottom line, I can't recommend this particular camera or any at all that Panasonic makes.  I've always had such good luck with Panasonic, but not this time.
