            I love the older Preludes.  I think the stylings before the remodel in 98 are priceless.

Back in April I bought a used 95 Prelude.  Black on black leather, with heavy tint.  Very stylish.  The interior leather is half decent, not terribly soft at all, but the looks are where it's at with this car.  Add on carbon fiber or wood panneling lights up the dash with just enough styling.  The leather is quite hard to find.

Standard stereo is Am/fm/tape with 6-pack in the trunk.  I've had quite a bit of troubles with the six pack skipping on Ohio highways.  It works fine in Pensylvania, New York and Ontario, so I'll blame Ohio's roads.  The stereo sounds great.  6 speakers, including two built rear-ward facing ones in the dash, it's got a great bottom end.

The most impressive thing about this car is the power.  Standard powerplant is a 2.3 litre non-vtec 4 cylinder that puts out 160 horsepower.  Considering the car is rather light, this is more then enough power.  It won't beat V-8's, but it'll certainly run circles around any V-6.  The efficiency of the honda engines never cease to amaze me.  If you're looking for a bit more power, there's a VTEC option which (for the techhies) uses variable valve timing to increase the power when above 3500 RPM.  The Vtec model puts out 190 horses.

Road performance is outstanding.  Cornering is excellent.  You can literally push 1g in the corners.  This car handles the curves in a simply outstanding manner.  This is where the car really shines, it will out-corner any V8, largely because of the weight difference with the small engine.  These small cars will beat an American V-8 on a course with lots of turns on practically any occaision.

This car is a beautiful intersection between the beauty of japanese engineering and style. <br><br>
