            We just purchased this vehicle, and boy are we pleased.  Having just left a mini-van, and having a new addition to our family, it's amazing how much cargo space this car has.  We were able to take our normal trek back home for Christmas, and everything came with us.  Gifts, luggage, kids and diapers.  We are a family of 4 and the trip was comfortable for all.

What can I say about the trunk.  It's huge!  I had to crawl inside the trunk to get some of the packages in the back.  If I had to describe the contents we put in there I would say we had:  1) One large suitcase, 2) a garment bag, 3) two duffle bags, 4) three large department store shopping bags filled with gifts, 5) a gym bag and 6) two winter coats.  What helped us stuff the trunk to the brim was the clever way they installed the trunk lid to the car.  Everything is external to the interior of the trunk.  The arms do not go into the trunk to smash cargo, they are on the outside and give no interference with items inside the trunk.  I just can't say enough about the carrying capacity of the car.  I would be here for hours.

The ride is extremely smooth and the vehicle has very good pickup.  Through the hills of Virginia and West Virginia the car maintained a constant speed.

We only found one defect so far.  The driver's side door locks do not respond to the automatic locking mechanism or the remote.  But that will be repaired as soon as we get the car back to the dealer.

If you are looking for a new car, or you don't want to be in an SUV or Minivan, then this is the vehicle for you.
