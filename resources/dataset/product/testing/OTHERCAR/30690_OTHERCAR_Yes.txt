            I have to tell you how much I love this rental car I have (this is all in jest - laughter is a requirement, not an option)...  I recently had an accident, and my car is in the shop for a week (in case you are wondering, it's a Geo Prizm, and despite being the obvious target for jokes, has been a great car...).  The insurance agency gave me <b>this</b> car to use.  I guess they are really p!ssed off at me.

First of all, ANY car short of a Ferrari would have failed to satisfy me after waiting an hour for the agency to bring my car by (they were an hour late).  But this wonderful creation by the Munchkins was a little bit amusing to behold.

Based on my first day, here is the advertisement I made up for this car:

<i>Come see the future of inexpensive automobiles!  This thing has some serious pickup - it could hold its own with any go-cart or 1919 Edsel out there.  And the room.  A family of 4 capuchin monkeys could LIVE in this thing.  Of course, that fresh 'Eu-de-stale-cigarette' which it has can't be bought for any price.  But how could one ask for anything more when you can pick up over 3 FM stations and have a door that automatically closes for you - yes, a door that will shut on your leg, your head and your hand - without ANY help from you!  That's right, folks, it's the new Pontiac (R) Sunfire (TM) - coming to a bubblegum vending machine near you, soon...</i>

Okay, now onto the specifics - well, I don't have any.  There was no user's manual in the car, in case I needed them.  I understand that this is a rental, but they might have at least given me SOME functional things.  

<b>Engine</b>
The car is SLOW... I think I out-paced Grandma Jones on her bicycle, but that was about it.  It doesn't have much in the way of pickup, despite the fact that it is designed as a sports car (of course, that governor could have something to do with that...).  It seems to get decent gas mileage, but since I haven't filled it up yet, I can't be sure (the gas gauge was at 1/2 when I got the car and has only slipped a bit over the 50 miles I have driven).  

<b>Interior</b>
The interior is SMALL.  Now, remember I have a Geo Prizm, not exactly the Cadillac of economy cars in terms of room.  But this car is worse.  I can only hope to be buried in something with a bit more space.  The seating is cramped - even as far back as it will go, the seat is too close to the steering column - if you are 6' or taller, look elsewhere.  Trying to reach into the back to hang a jacket was tough because the seat doesn't go very far forward.  Of course, I also HATE 2-door cars, so that might be a personal gripe shining through.  <i>(But this is my opinion, so if you don't like my gripes, please call 1-800-like-i-care...)</i>

<b>Handling</b>
Well, it handles somewhat better than the plywood board on a skateboard that I had as a tyke, but not much.  Trucks going by you (THAT would never happen in the Geo, let me tell YOU!) rattle the car around pretty well, and it constantly feels as though the suspension is a bit uneven.  Moving at 70 mph, the car tends to pull back and forth a bit, although it doesn't quite 'shake'.  I tend to feel like the slightest extra movement will have catastrophic effects, but at the same time it really doesn't seem to want to hang on to the center of a lane, either. 

<b>Controls</b>
Now for the ease of use, as it were.  The radio installed in my vehicle-of-eternal-convenience is ... well, my cousin's Fisher-Price radio has more functionality.  But this <b>is</b> a rental, so in this regard, I really can't pan them - the real stereos are probably much better.  But the overall control panel is a little odd.  A/C and defroster controls are located way to the right, far away from the drivers hands, while the temperature controls are located near the bottom of the center panel, making it also a reach to find and adjust.  

Another odd thing is the fact that when I got out of the car last night (having removed the key), not only did the dome light stay lit for a while (this I understand) but the stereo also refused to turn off.  I thought maybe I took the key out of the wrong position but no.  Either it's misfunctioning, or Pontiac has <b>finally</b> installed the eagerly-anticipated 'Delayed Radio Power-off' function that so many people forgot to ask for.  I sat there trying to figure out what the heck was going on before it just ... faded.  Keep in mind, the volume and everything were still going - it wasn't just the clock light.  Seems very strange to me...

<b>Conclusion</b>
At this point, I have already had enough of this strange car.  Like I said, it's a rental, and I probably didn't get the creme de la creme of the group, but even taking that into account, this is a scary car for anyone but that 16-year old FIRST car, although with its size, I wouldn't really look at this car for that, either.  

My mom had a Grand Am which she loved, but this car is the ugly stepsister of that one.  If you have to rent it, be prepared.  If you are borrowing it, try to find another friend.  But if you are going to BUY it - have your head checked.
