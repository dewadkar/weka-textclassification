            Epinions works the way it was meant, for a consumer to research a product and make a decision. For me, my husband and I were looking for a high quality digital camera for our small photography business but didn't want to spend a couple thousand dollars for the professional quality ones.

After researching here, and a few hands on demonstrations at a number of stores, we decided on the 3.3 Megapixel <b>Olympus C-3000 Zoom.</b> It was a decent price, provided the high resolution options, and used a USB port to download (therefore faster). The fact that it takes 30-second video and had accessories (optional) for larger zoom lenses was definitely a bonus.

======================================
<b>Out of the Box</b>
======================================

First things first, getting everything set up and ready to start using wasn't exactly a quick and easy task. Sure, open it up, insert batteries, turn it on, point and shoot. Well, actually you did have to run a set up program before you could do all that and you did have to follow the instructions in the setup manual to understand what you were setting up.

Before you start taking pictures I HIGHLY recommend you read through the manual and figure out the settings. Otherwise you may end up with a somewhat expensive camera that just takes pictures like the cheaper ones because you don't know what it can do.

I spent an evening with the camera and manual just playing with it. Understanding the different modes, flash options, picture types and resolution settings took quite a while to figure out. But in the end, we have a camera that can do just about anything, takes fabulous pictures, and doesn't confuse us.

======================================
<b>The Manual</b>
======================================

Well, I guess I should say "manuals". It comes with several different language versions and each are about 235 pages. Of course it is a small size, but a still a little intimidating. So far though, any question I've come up with regarding the manual I've been able to find the answers.

It walks you through different areas and really does a good job on helping you understand your new purchase. Below are the sections that it covers:

- Preparation
- Basic Functions
- Movie Functions
- Storing Data for Printing Pictures
- Using a Personal Computer
- Camera Settings
- Miscellaneous

======================================
<b>The Software</b>
======================================

Camedia version 2.0 is the software that Olympus includes with the camera and is very simple to use. Our other digital also uses Camedia but an older version. We did have some problems since we had the older version on the computer, but they were fixed quickly.

The older camera used a serial port to download the pictures, this camera uses a USB port. So the software got a little confused when we originally started it because it was still looking for a serial port.

I must say, I prefer the USB port now. A picture that took almost a full minute to download with the serial cables, only took a max of about 10 seconds. And when you are downloading a hundred or more pictures, that saved time really adds up.

======================================
<b>The Details and Options</b>
======================================

The <b>Olympus C-3000 Zoom</b> is a very sleek and professional looking camera. So many these days have been miniaturized to fit in the palm of your hand, but when do a few hours of photography, just wouldn't be comfortable. Although smaller than most 35mm cameras, it still has the look and feel of one. The hand grip is definitely meant for right handed people, but considering all cameras are designed with the shutter release on the right side, I don't think it would be a problem. It has a rougher texture on the hand grip making it easier and more comfortable to hold.

Everything on the camera is designed so just about anyone could control everything in one hand. The zoom, on/off, program menus, flash options and display options are well placed so if you are in a situation that requires your other hand for something, you can easily take all the photos you need.

<i>Quality Modes & Number of Pictures on 8 MG</i>

- TIFF (1600 X 1200) = 1
- SHQ (2048 X 1536) = 4
- HQ (2048 X 1536) = 10
- SQ1 (1280 X 960) = 24
- SQ2 (640 X 480) = 82

These are just examples of the lowest settings in each category. If you are wanting printable pictures that are of good quality, I really recommend using HQ or SQ1 with a minimum of 1280 X 960. I also recommend you spend a little extra and purchase the 64mb card to use instead of the 8mb. At SQ1 we are able to take over 200 pictures (which is actually more than the manual says it will take).

======================================
<b>Actual Usage Abilities</b>
======================================

I know, I've gone into way too many details so far, and I haven't even scratched the surface. So how about we get to what is really important ... how it works, and what the end product really looks like. 

We took the camera on vacation with us and us and ended up taking over 300 pictures without having to download them. I was wonderful not running out of film. We also have some on SHQ, some on HQ, and some movies. It's nice that we didn't have to stick with one mode and that was it. It incorporated the different modes and adjusted the number of pictures left accordingly.

We also took almost 300 pictures at a wedding for someone. Our only problem with that is that we added new batteries before the wedding and they ran out before the end. Part of that is our fault, we didn't use the optimal batteries for this camera. However, the original batteries lasted well over 400 pictures. I'm definitely going back to that type.

After downloading all of these pictures we only noted one real problem. And part of that was lack of knowledge. The reception pictures at the wedding had quite a bit of red-eye. We hadn't fully researched the different flash modes and ended up doing a lot of editing. 

The pictures themselves have been incredible. Being able to see individual hairs or where someone missed in shaving that morning was proof that it sometimes saw more than the human eye. Even more frightening was the day my husband downloaded the quick pic he'd done of my son. He noticed a hair on his monitor or something and went to clean it. Then he realized it was in the picture. So he cleaned off the lens, but there was nothing on it. Next he went to the wall where my son had been standing and found a small hair-line crack in the paint that he had never noticed before. The camera can sometimes pick up the details that you really don't want to know about! 

======================================
<b>Printing!</b>
======================================

I have an HP PhotoSmart P1000 printer that does a really nice job on printing out color pictures. With the digital pics taken from the C-3000 they were even more detailed. We can run a picture on normal xerox paper and place it behind a frame and no one would know the difference between it and a professional photo.

However, when printing on the Kodak Matte or Glossy photo paper, I must say the results are spectacular. The only time you can tell it is a digital print is if you enlarge it past its capacity. If you keep it at its size or decrease the size, your friends, family and/or clients may never know if it was taken with a digital camera or a film camera.

======================================
<b>My Recommendation</b>
======================================

I wouldn't recommend the <b>Olympus C-3000 Zoom</b> to everyone. However, if you are a shutterbug, you do photography for business or pleasure on a regular basis, or you need to do small movie files, I would definitely recommend this camera.

For those on a smaller budget, you may want to check out the <b>Olympus D-400 Zoom</b> for about $400 less. It still provides good quality pictures for those that can't afford that much.

I personally am very happy with our choice for our new digital camera. With the cost of developing and the number of pictures that I take, I'm sure this camera will pay for itself very quickly.
