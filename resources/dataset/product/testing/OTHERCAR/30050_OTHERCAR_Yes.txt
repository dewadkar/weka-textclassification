            Am I describing a camera or a car?  Both probably have just as many features, but the good thing is they all come standard with this camera. 

Now, if I could only get this camera to work itself I could add self-sufficient to the list.  

I got this camera one week before Christmas, as an early present.  The reason I got it is another story.  My beloved 35 mm Nikon camera that i had for over 15 years, and that I bought with my babysitting money (my first major purchase) decided that it had flashed one too many times and gave out me.  I had a moment of silence for it and when I came out of mourning I quickly realized I needed to get a new camera.  Why you ask?  Simple I say, I have four kids and need to capture every moment.

At first I was thinking I just wanted to get a nice all in one camera with built in flash and zoom lens.  After years of dragging around the flash, two times zoom lens, wide angle lense and so on, I thought it might be nice to be able to point and click, not assemble, point and miss the photo.  My 35 mm got awesome pictures with the zoom lens plus two times lens, so I wanted a camera with that capability.

While I was thinking along theses lines, my husband the original Inspector Gadget was thinking digital.  At first this seemed like a rather expensive solution, and that little vein right above my eye started to twich and then throb.  However, when you begin to factor in the cost of a good automatic camera plus all the film we buy and all the money it costs to develop those picture, digital began to make sense.  It would be a lot more cash up front, but over time would pay for itself.   

I left the decision up to my husband. He did some web research and this camera got great reviews, so he decided to get it. 

I was intimidated when I opened the box and saw all those parts and instructions.  I'm sure I probably felt the same way when I got the Nikon, but I learned how to use that and I would learn how to us this. After all, the clock was ticking, I had to learn how to use it by Christmas eve.  It took about 15 minutes to master the basic ideas and I add some new knowledge each day.

It's very pretty simple to operate.  It's also one of those things you just need to goof around with to figure out what works best. The best part is you can just delete the bad shots, you don't have to pay to develop them.  The camera has lots of neat bells and whistles, like being able to add a border around a shot as you're taking it, it has a sepia mode for taking artistic shots.  It also comes with a red-eye reduction feature, which works great.  If you don't use it you'll end up with children of the corn.  The one bad thing about the red-eye reduction is we have to retrain our kids.  The flash goes off once before the actual flash, so the kids have moved thinking the picture was taken before you're done.  It also takes great pictures in the dark, like at school plays and recitals.

some other features are - 

2.0 megapixel picture quality - photos look sharp and real, not grainy

quick turn on and takes three pictures in rapid succession - great for web pages where you want action photos of your kids

6x zoom - not as good as my old camera, but still pretty good

quick picture transfer

instant review of photos taken - no more hoping and guessing if you got the right shot

compact and lightweight - travels great and easy to take around amusement parks and other places

fun toy - everyone wants a turn and I never get to use it

Kodak also has a great support website, to answer any other questions that come up or to just get some cool ideas.

There are just a few minor drawbacks.  This camera does eat batteries, so get some rechargeable ones.  Depending on how many photos you take, you may need to get some additional card for holding photos before you can download them which can get expensive. 

I have already talked a friend into getting one, and he loves it too. Hello Kodak where's my commission.

I love this camera, it's fun, easy to use and now instead of having a drawer full of undeveloped rolls of film, I have them all untouched on my desktop.<br><br>
