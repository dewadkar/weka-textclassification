            I love my camera!  My husband bought it for me for Christmas 99.
I mainly wanted one so that I could send pictures to family and friends over the internet.  But now I am also using it to sell things.  I take pictures of an item to show to someone who might be interested in buying from me.  

It has a zoom feature, and of course the display screen on the back of the camera.  It has a timer so that way you can be in the picture with the rest of you're family and not have to take the pic yourself.  
It also has a tripod attachment.

It takes really good pictures.  I just love it.  This is a GREAT camera for the price!!!  I wouldn't take anything for it.  It comes with a photo program.  It is really nice, and very easy to use.  

You'll love it!
