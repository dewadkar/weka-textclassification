            I recently traded my 2002 Ford F250 Crew Cab V10 for a 2003 GMC Yukon XL Denali. This SUV is The Ultimate in Comfort, Control, Ride, Room, and lots of Power! 

I was tired of bouncing around in my 3/4 ton truck. At the time I was towing a tournament ski boat, and it was only my wife, and I. Now I have two young boys, and needed more room. 

I originally went the Ford for the V10 pulling power. I don't like diesels, and the Ford V-8's don't have the power. The Denali has a 6.0 Liter V8 vs. 6.8 Liter V10. The only difference is the torch, but the V8 has more horsepower. The Ford only has a slight advantage in power, but what I'm towing it won't make a difference. 

The Control of the AWD Denali is amazing! It hugs the road like a sports sedan, along with a very smooth ride & Room for seven. 

I opted for the 2nd row Heated Captains Chairs, along with a Sunroof. There are only two other options available, a $1900.00 DVD Multimedia Navigation System, and a rear DVD Entertainment System. You can only opt for the Sunroof or the Rear Entertainment system from the factory. I opted for the Sun! 

I love the 7 Disc Am/Fm/XM Cassette, 9 speakers Bose Sound System. I especially like the XM feature of 100 digital satellite radio. Now I can listen to Nascar while I'm on the road. 

My favorite part of the Denali is the 9 position Heated Driver Seat with Memory. The Ford did not have the dual lumbar power. Also lacking in the Ford was memory, and no adjustable headrest. The Denali also has tow different heat settings for the seat. You can heat the whole seat or just the back is what I use the most. I have a bad back, and it has never felt better while driving down the road in my new Denali. 

The 3 Zone Auto Climate Control is an answer to many complaints by the wife. She can set her side to her desires temp, and I can do the same. The rear of the suv is also auto controlled making everyone happy! 

The self-dimming rear view mirror, and the outside auto dim is a great safety feature. The mirrors also have turn signals to let the cars behind know what lane you want to go to. I have never felt safer while driving then in this SUV. Front & Side airbags, and the security of OnStar, not to mention the size of the vehicle. 

If you are considering an SUV look no further. This is the One to Buy. If you need a smooth ride, lots of power, room for 7 or 8, and Great Looks the GMC Yukon XL Denali fit's the Bill!
