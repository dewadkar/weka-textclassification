            When I started looking for SUV's I was very limited by the fact that the vehicle I wanted had to have a 5 speed manual transmission. Nowadays the choices are limited in this respect. I narrowed my choices to the Nissan Xterra and Pathfinder. I test drove the Xterra first then the Pathfinder. To make a long story short there is no comparison, the Pathfinder is superior in every way, except possibly looks and that's a matter of taste.

One of the major shortcomings of previous Pathfinder models was the weak engine. The 2001 Pathfinder has a much more powerful engine than previous models. Based on the V6 engine used in the Nissan Maxima, it is 240 horsepower with the automatic transmission and 250 horsepower with the 5 speed manual transmission. This is an SUV that can merge onto the highway, or pass another vehicle without breaking a sweat. The handling is also great, with very little body roll even in tight, fast turns it handles more like a car than a truck. The shift on the fly 4 wheel drive system is not the most advanced on the market but it certainly gets the job done. Along with the good ground clearance this vehicle can get through snow and go off road with equal aplomb.

Seating is very comfortable and the controls are all easy to reach and use. The stereo controls as well as the cruise control are located on the steering wheel and are convenient and safer than more conventional controls. The 6 CD in dash changer is fantastic and very convenient. No longer will you have to listen to the same 6 CD's over and over because the changer is inconveniently located and you never get around to replacing them.

This SUV is great for hauling stuff. In addition to the standard roof rack there is a large flat area in the back for all the groceries you need to pick up. If you need to pick up some larger items the back seat folds down in a one third, two thirds configuration. This is handy when you have something long to haul but still need to have someone sit back there as well. The Pathfinder has about the most cargo space of any SUV in it's class.

There are a couple of negatives. Gas mileage isn't great. All that power comes at a price and gas mileage and required grade of gas are the price you pay. The recommended grade of gas is 91 octane which means you'll be paying more to put that premium gas in it. I've found combined city and highway driving to net around 16 to 17 mpg. Highway only driving has resulted in about 19 mpg. In my opinion the extra power is worth the extra spending on gas. The other negative is tire changing. Be forewarned, if you think you might ever have to change a tire by yourself, familiarize yourself with the procedure before you actually have to do it. I got a flat in the pouring rain and it wasn't fun trying to figure out the procedure for removing the full size spare (stowed under the car) and where to place the jack while getting soaked.

When all is said and done, this is a very refined, powerful, practical and fun to drive SUV. The build quality and reliability has been as good as I've ever seen and I couldn't be much happier with it. It has exceeded my expectations in virtually ever way.
