                 I first wanted a simple SUV.  I thought that the Range Rover was completely ridicules and over priced before I saw its capabilities.  The salesperson, Sam, wanted to take me on a test drive.  

Little did I know where we were going.  We went to the back of the Range Rover dealer in Cary, NC.  They had an off road setup available for test driving.  The Range Rover handled unbelievably.  With its capability to handle just about anything.  I thought that this was still extravagant, but I took Sam up on the loaner for a week.   

An unexpected snow storm hit Raleigh that week and everyone was stranded in their homes.  My wife, who is a nurse was on call and needed to give immediate assistance to one of her clients.  I wasn't sure if the Range Rover could make it, but we decided to try anyway.    

There was over 20 inches of unheard of snow on the ground and the roads were terrible.  But, I used the Range Rovers great raising hydraulic system and handled the roads beautifully.  The elder who my wife was attending to needed help and my wife was able to get there.  

Luckily for the elderly lady we had the Range Rover or she may have died that day.  Needless to say, I went and bought a Range Rover the next week without even thinking twice about it.<br><br>
