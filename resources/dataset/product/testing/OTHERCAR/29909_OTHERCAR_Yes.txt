            When I was a sophomore in college, 1994, I was doing a lot of activities off campus and I always need to find a friend who wasn't busy to drive me to various places.  So, my parents agreed to get me a car.  I test drove several cars (For Escort, Chevy Cavalier, Tracker).  My dad mentioned there was a brand new model out now and was VERY similar to the Chevy Cavalier and it was a few thousand dollars cheaper.  I decided why not, that was the care I liked the most at that time anyway.

I saw the car, and I fell in love immediately.  It was the only one they had on the lot and I loved the color.  It's called &quot;metalic blue&quot; and it just looked like a very &quot;happy&quot; car with the front bumper looking like a smile.  It drove smoothly, and yes, it was very similar to the Chevy Cavalier.  The seats were a lot more comfortable in the Sunfire.  So we bought the car.

Six years later, it's still running just fine.  It was recalled to the manufacturer once, the transmission needed to be replaced and I also needed to replace the gas tank, but it's a wonderful reliable car.  I figure, two major problems with the car in six years in not at all bad.  I foresee myself having this car for another six years or more.  I love it.  I love getting into my &quot;happy&quot; car every day.<br><br>
