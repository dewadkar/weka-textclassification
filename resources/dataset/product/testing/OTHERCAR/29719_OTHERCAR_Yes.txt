            Unlike many of the professional reviews that you might read about the Vigor, I will tell you that the car has timeless styling, more then enough engine power, and is a steal considering Acura doesn't make it anymore. The TL essentially replaced the Vigor. Originally, the TL carried the 2.5 Inline 5 cylinder engine (in addition to a 3.2 V6 engine). I personally believe that the 2.5-liter was one of the better engine designs produced. For example, Volvo and Saab both still make 5 cylinder engines. However, back to the point of this review.

I purchased this car for 2 reasons. The first was that in 1995, Acura announced that it was discontinuing the Vigor line. That immediately dropped the price of all used Vigor's by 25%. I bought mine used (it's a 1992) for $14K with 50K miles. The GS model (which is the one I have) originally sold for $30K. I wasn't concerned with service or parts as the next year in 1996, Acura came out with the TL that was a rebagded Vigor (to fool the media?). For the 3 years that it was in production (92-94), the Vigor had not received rave reviews. Common complaints were lack of engine power (not true), non-descript styling (not true) and not enough room (that is true). In summary, my first reason was the value that the Vigor represented.

The second reason that I bought the Vigor was that it is a Honda product. Everything that Honda makes goes forever. My roommate in college had a Prelude with 300K miles on it. My Vigor has 150K miles on it now and it is still going strong. I don't see me getting rid of the car in the next 50K to 100K miles either.

What do I love about this car? It has enough power to let me feel like I could win Indy if I wanted too, but not enough to get me into trouble with the law. It truly is a driver�s car. The sound system is awesome (8 speakers with digital signal processing - this allows for music to be 'altered' so that it sounds like you are at different location such as a concert, a recording studio, a stadium, etc.).

What do I dis-like about this car? The car is small. My wife and I just bought a 2000 Mazda MPV and we drove it exclusively for a week. Then I went back to driving my car and felt confined (not Miata confined though). You will probably find that a well-equipped Camry offers more room in the back. However most all Honda's (except for 2000 Odyssey) suffer from lack of backseat room. 

Driving the car is great. This really is a driver�s car. In the drivers seat, you are low slung (for a sedan anyway). The steering wheel is straight on (as opposed to some American cars that tend to offset the steering wheel) with radio and climate controls to your right (they are centered as well; not pointed toward driver as in some cars). Storage space is adequate with a glove box and center armrest/console. 

Anyone who would normally buy a midsize sedan should look at this car. It is great for a family of two who needs to occasionally carry more passengers.
