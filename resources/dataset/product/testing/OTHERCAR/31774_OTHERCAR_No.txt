            Not only has my girlfriend recently moved in with me &#150 she also brought two things that I have loved since the moment I saw them. The first is her chocolate tipped kitten &#150 Buttons, the second is her new and somewhat spiffy car &#150 a BMW Z8. It must be said that 2003 is proving to be a very good year.

What does dismay me somewhat is that the arrival of this car makes my VW Golf seem somewhat, well utilitarian. Whilst the Golf may have a nice interior, good trunk space and a very nice stereo it requires good material to help stick you to the seats &#150 the Z8 on the other hand is so sexy that I have to be peeled, moist and dripping, from them. A little strong you may think &#150 perhaps but then you have to remember this is not a car &#150 it&#146s a piece of automotive pornography

Looks

Well this is certainly a car that&#146s going to turn heads. Loosely based on the BMW roadsters from the 1950s the car is striking rather than handsome. From certain angles (such as head on) it takes on the look of a rather bemused bream or perhaps a startled cod with those fog lights buried in the fish mouth grill. Still the 18 inch wheels fill the wheel arches nicely and the car is well proportioned &#150 looking as good with the hard-top on as with it and the soft top down. I guess that the car is attractive in the way that a Berlin Bierkeller wench might be attractive &#150 it&#146s ruddy and willing looking rather than being svelte and sophisticated.

Interior

Well it&#146s very, very red. Extremely red. And it&#146s retro. Now this is not a car that&#146s retro in the way that it&#146s baby brother the Mini is retro. There are no obvious plastics and unseemly joins on view here &#150 it&#146s all made of very adult material. It&#146s just that the adult material is assembled in such a way as to make the car resemble the interior of a fake 1950s American diner theme restaurant. Sure the three spoke wheel (each made up of four aluminium rods) is rather tasty but the radio, the red leather mount around the 6 speed gearstick and that silver radio really don&#146t do it for this girl.

Performance

Start up the engine and it will burble away like a coal miner with bronchitis. It&#146s a deep, rich noise that resonates right through the cabin and comes to rest somewhere in your crotch. If all women were given a Z8 you&#146d find far fewer sitting on the washing machine during its spin cycle, of that I&#146m certain. Throaty is how Anna (the girlfriend and &#150 pah! &#150 owner) has described it. Throbbing would be my description.

Pile on the revs (and my isn&#146t that easy to do) and the throaty burble becomes a scream not unlike that of the Honda S2000, though perhaps a little less outrï¿½ &#150 a little more suburban semi orgasm with half a mind to the neighbours overhearing than full in the woods alone total body shaker &#150 but a scream never-the-less.

0-60 comes up very quickly indeed &#150 aided by a short throw gearbox of some precision. BMW claim a time of 4.7 seconds and I have no reason to doubt this. Push the pedal all the way down and you&#146ll keep building speed all the way up to 155mph where the killjoy computer will cut in and tell you that that&#146s quite enough fun thank you very much and wouldn&#146t you rather slow down a little.

The naughty computer will also cut in on corners should the glee factor be too high and correct all of the mistakes that it thinks that you&#146re making. BMW calls this Cornering Brake Control and antiskid system &#150 I call being a kill joy. Still to be fair to them it is less intrusive than similar systems in say the Audi TT and it could save lives.

Ride and Handling

Now it might just be me but for a car that claims to be Sports the Z8 is just a little too easily unsettled. Sure it sits squat on the road, feels tight, controls body roll well and feeds back through the steering very well but take it fast through a bumpy corner and suddenly all hell breaks loose. The chassis starts to chatter, the wheel jumps just a little and the whole thing takes on a little feel of the nervous nelly. As I said it may just be me &#150 I do tend to approach bends in this car at speeds my VW has never seen on the highway but I do feel that the car loses its nerve somewhere before I lose mine.

Quality and reliability

It&#146s a BMW and it feels like one. Well put together, solid and no doubt ready to run forever. It&#146s still only 3 months old but to date we&#146ve had no problems at all &#150 and as the car cost $120,000 we&#146d expect much sucking up, grovelling and crawling over glass should anything happen.

Equipment

Everything and the kitchen sink. The sat-nav system talks to you rather than displaying maps &#150 which I quite like. The hood goes up and down nicely (though not as nicely as a Merc, the Peugeot 206cc or even the newest Diahatsu) and stows away.

Shame then that there&#146s no room for a spare tyre (you get a kit to help you limp to the garage) and that the rear window in the soft-top is plastic and not glass. To date it seems like good quality plastic but I do fear scratches as summer approaches and the top starts to imitate a freshman&#146s knickers (up and down like there&#146s no tomorrow)

Cost to run

Astronomical. The car goes through (premium) gas in much the same way that Oliver Reid did red wine or J Lo does husbands. To date we&#146ve managed a shocking 12mpg &#150 shocking especially as I am one of those people who wants to throw a brick through the window of every oversized SUV you see blocking out the sun on the school run. Service costs are not for the faint of heart and insurance cost will leave you feeling both light in the wallet and in the head.

Practicality

Don&#146t be silly. It&#146s a two seater with virtually no truck and it makes no apologies for it.

Overall

So why do I love this fish faced, red interiored, gas guzzling, jittery monstrosity? Well it has the engine from the M5,it will pin you back in the seat should you dare to test its awesome power. But best of all it manages to attract a crowd of small boys (and often their dads) when we leave it in a car-park somewhere. And there&#146s nothing better than coming out of the store to find a bunch of dribbling schoolboys (and their kids) lost in awe of something that you own. Or rather something that your reech-beetch girlfriend owns and bless her heart lets you drive
