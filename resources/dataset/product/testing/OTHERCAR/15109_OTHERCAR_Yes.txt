            	Comfortable, reliable, quiet. I have a 99' Altima SE Limited. Red exterior,black leather interior, completely loaded except sunroof. This is my first new car, chosen after months of online research and test drives.
	I have to admit I used to own a 72 mustang Mach I and was disappointed
at this cars power, but soon warmed up to it. It has decent passing speed and gas mileage is pretty good ( 26-30 MPG).All the interior fit and trim is tight and I have no squeaks. This model has sport tuned suspension and 4 wheel ABS. The steering is a little soft and the rear end is vague in severe handling around tight turns but most people would not drive this type of car in the manner I &quot;test&quot; it. I bought it for my family, and a great family car it has been. Nissan is known for reliability, and I have had no problems. I recommend this smart buy to anyone looking for a great deal on a dependable yet sporty sedan. If you are looking for extreme torque, top end speed, or superior cornering this is probably not the car for you.
