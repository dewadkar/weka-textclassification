            One day my husband and I were in the mood (AGAIN) to go looking at cars, and we thought about looking at a KIA, so we drove on down to the local KIA dealer (after hours of course) I can't stand salesmen hasseling me when I am trying to look peacefully at cars.  Well we looked at one and the doors happened to be unlocked, so we sat in the car and the first thing I noticed was how HARD the seats were and how much plastic was used it was the kind of cheap plastic you see in dodge or plymouth cars and trucks! (sorry chrysler lovers, but its true they stink too!)

The doors and everything else were also cheapo, so we got out and said &quot;Nahhhhhhhhhhh&quot;.  I guess the only nice thing about the car was that it had a CD player built in, thats the only good thing about the inside, but really the cars are nice looking on the outside.  I guess if they sold them for around $5000.00 brand new I might consider buying one, just because the price would be RIGHT and the warranty would help out with any problems for a while!  

I also baby sit for a lady who bought one of these cars brand new, and she has had it in the shop 3 times! So, think well before purchasing a BIG TICKET item like a car!<br><br>
