            My dream car has always been the Mitsubishi 3000GT. Ever since I was small, I would fanticize myself driving one of these car due to their sporty and mean look. That dream became a reality when I graduated high school in the top ten students.

I was extremely happy when my parents and I bought a 1995 Black 3000GT at the dealership in Dallas, Texas. The car was great at first. When you turn it on, you can feel the engine roaring and the car warming up. The driving was smooth and great. The sound system is provided by 6 Infinity speakers and an Infinity cd changer plus tape cassette. The stock also had an equalizer for you to play and change with.

Well for the first few months, it was great. But soon, I began to realize it was eating up a lot of gas. I mean, every time you start the engine it sucks up gas and you can only use supreme gasoline. The car is a V6 engine. One day, the overdrive went out on me. Well, I kept on driving thinking it wouldn't be that big of a deal because every car place I went to told me I didn't really need overdrive. Well one day, my car wouldn't run after I stop at a Stop sign. Well I had to toll my car into the shop and it turned out that the clutches for my automatic had burn out and that I would need to rebuild my transmission. The transmission ended up costing me 2200 dollars. With that amount of money, I could have gotten me a whole new engine for another car!!!!

That wasn't all, I then had to change my belts. The belts for this car cost me 750 bucks! This is so overprice. Well I did a tune up for my car which cost 350. Overall, this car cost more than it is actually worth. A tire each for my car cost 200 bucks. After all this, I knew what I had to do. I had to sell it and get me a more dependable and economical car since I am a college student.

Overall, if you want looks and appearance, and you have the money for it then this is the car for you. If you want something to be reliable and long lasting, then think of another foreign car company preferably HONDA.
