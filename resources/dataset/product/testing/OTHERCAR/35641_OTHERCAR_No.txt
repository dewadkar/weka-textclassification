            If it does not work, return it.  But make sure you do so while the manufacturer's warranty is still good.  In addition, you should always extend the life of your digital gadgets by purchasing some warranty.  Just to make sure.  My journey in the new land of digital photographing started last year when my wife surprised me with a <b>Kodak DX3215 Digital Camera.</b>  We had talked about all the great things we could do with all the pictures of our kids we were taking.  With the digital camera, we could send to grandparents and family friends who live in other states and foreign countries.  We would like to include some of our best pics as postcards.  Any way, great was my joy when I received this gift for my birthday.  Aren't we all happy with this type of electronic gift?

<b>Setting up the camera</b>

I must admit that setting it up was just a breeze.  In fact, I did it in one sitting.  The first thing we did was to take pictures of our kids and the dogs.  With the Kodak Camera Dock in place, we quickly transferred them to the computer with the Kodak Picture Transfer Software.  Then the whole thing opens automatically.  It was time for us to improve our pictures by removing the red eyes, trimming them to the size we wanted them.  We rotated them just to make the kids laugh.  Then, when we were not happy with the light and contrast, we worked on these pictures again and made appropriate adjustments.  At that point, we decided to save them.  After working on each picture, we decided to try a key feature that is the kids' favorite.  <b>Slideshow</b> is the feature allowing you to show these pictures either by wiping, revealing them.  You can even name them.  Creating your slideshow only takes a few seconds.  Then, you can decide how long each shot is going to be seen.  Just pick how many seconds you want the pictures to last.  We saved some of the best pictures to send to grandma via e-mail.  When she received them, she was so excited to see her grandchildren.  Oh yes, she did show and share them with the all the other mates of the condo.  That's how grandparents are anyway.  Soon thereafter, we took our camera on our trip to the coast.  More pictures were taken.  Then all hell broke loose.

<b>Camera would not even retain charges; DX3215 would not even turn on</b>

The first thing I did was to make sure the batteries were good.  I place the camera on the dock to be charged overnight.  The following morning, I removed it from the dock, shot a few pictures, maybe 3 of them.  Then, <b>it went dark.  I could not see anything on the LCD screen</b>
I decided to charge it for a longer period of time.  I left it on the dock all day long.  By the time I returned home from work, I was expecting it to be fully charged if charging was the real issue.  It was to no avail.  The problem must have been situated in other areas.  That's when it dawned on me to get some my papers ready.  My wife helped me look for the receipt and the warranty that we bought on the camera.  And because it was so recent, it still had the manufacturer's warranty.  So, with two warranties, we could not go wrong.  It may sound so stupid, but you just want to make sure you don't throw all this money down the tube.  Now that we look back on the purchase, we realized that we could have gotten any other camera, less bulky and with interesting features for a far lower amount.  New technology has this draw on all of us.  We want to have it now.  We can't wait.  As you may have found out by now, in the electronic market, the longer you wait, the best deals and bargains you can get.  In fact, prices tend to drop!

<b>Taking the camera back to the store</b>

Clutching the receipt and warranty papers, I took the camera back to CompUSA in my hometown.  My wife called to announce that I was on my way.  She could not believe that the store had sold her a lemon.  By the time I got there, the clerks were expecting me.  I was handed a form to fill out.  I included what was wrong with the camera and sent it with all <i>media card inside</i>.  The clerk told me that he was sending it back to the Kodack company because they don't do in-house repair.  It would take about two to three weeks.  So I was going to be without a camera for that long.  Countless pictures of graduation and birthday were to be lost.  It was back to the 35 mm once more.

<b>The fun when it was working:  Features of the camera</b>

The DX3215 Digital Camera comes equipped with a 4X zoom (2X optical and 2X digital) letting you to get closer to your target and the fun. With the right amount of MP, it can be touted as a beginner's camera.  Picture-taking is just a breeze if it works well. All you have to do is press a button. With this camera, you'll be able to capture your favorite moments either at the garden, the beach, swimming pool, church activities, community events and work place activities.  We should not forget the various extracurricular activities of your children.

This is how this camera was marketed to my wife.  Who would not fall for such a great description?  Obviously, no one expected it to be needing a quick repair soon.  After all, who wants it to be repaired.  How about a replacement?  

"With 8MB of internal memory, you'll never miss a shot. And with the DX3215's MultiMedia Card/Secure Digital memory card (MMC/SD) expansion slot, you'll have plenty of memory to keep on shooting with optional MMC/SD memory cards. If you use the KODAK EasyShare Camera Dock, sharing is just as easy. Simply place your DX3215 in the dock, touch the button, and pictures are automatically sent to your computer ready for e-mailing and printing. The Camera Dock will also recharge your camera's battery pack, so you'll always be ready to take more pictures."

As previously indicated, for the short time we owned the camera, we took great pleasure in it.  We took nice pictures which we sent to family members.  There were some manufacturer's defects which we did not anticipate.

<b>What did the Kodak Company do after two weeks?</b>

A message was left on my answering machine.  The camera was replaced.  So I went to CompUSA to pick it up.  The only problem was that the multimedia card was not inside.  So I had to wait for two more days before the clerk could locate it.  In the end, I received a brand new camera.  The warranty worked well.
