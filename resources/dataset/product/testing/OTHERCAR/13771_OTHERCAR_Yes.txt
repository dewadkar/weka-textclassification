            When my wife and I decided that we should trade my car in for something else that I wanted, I had one thought in mind &quot;TRUCK.&quot;  There was just no alternative in my mind.  For years I had suffered through asking friends of mine to borrow their trucks every time I needed one.  Those days were going to be over if I had anything to say about it.
My wife's only condition was to buy one that had enough room for our two kids and us comfortably.  I said no problem.  It would just have to be an extended cab.  I looked at Ford, GMC, Chevy, Dodge, and a few SUV's from various models.  The trucks were my primary focus.  As far as power was concerned, Ford, GMC, Chevy, and Dodge were all about the same.  However, Ford, GMC, and Chevy only had three-door models that, although convient, only opened on one side.  Price wise the trucks went from the GMC (most expensive), Chevy, Ford, and Dodge(least expensive).  The GMC's were nice, but not worth the price.  The Chevy and Ford were about the same as the GMC just a little cheaper.  Dodge had more room, comparable power, and easier accessibility for the better price.  It rides as smooth as a Lincoln Towncar. I love this truck.  It does everything that I want it to do, and satisfies my wife's need for a more roomier family car.  
For a TRUCK that doesn't break the bank account, go Dodge 1500 Quad Cab.  If you are in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, go see Lance Hill at Huffines Dodge in Lewisville, Tx at (972) 434-2288<br><br>
