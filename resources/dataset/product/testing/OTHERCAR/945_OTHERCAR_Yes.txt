                My 1995 Kia Sephia is my first and only car so far. I bought it used 3 years ago and it still runs beautifully. I have put almost 50,000 miles on it and I have NEVER had to take it in for repairs. It hasn't seen a shop other than for normal maintenance. It has been the most reliable car we have owned AND it is fun to drive. 
    It is small and sporty but roomy enough to be our family car. My husband, 15 month old son, and I can ride VERY comfortably on long car trips. The only thing I dislike is that it is a little cramped in back for tall people (I come from a line of many tall people &lt;g&gt;) especially with my son's car seat in the back. However, this is rarely a problem for me since there is usually no more than 3 people total in the car. 
     I would only recommend this car for small families and it is an excellent first car for teenagers and college students. Excellent value for the price!<br><br>
