                         I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc. points of view. I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from a steering and suspension system point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed in this area. You can find some very well engineered and built suspensions these days, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. 


     That said there is almost nothing you won't like about the suspension of the Lincoln Town Car. It is <b>one of the last of it's breed</b>. A true throwback to the big heavy rear wheel drive cars of old. Something your father or grandfather would be proud to be seen driving.

    The suspension on the Town Car is the old tried and true SLA ( short long arm ) type with a hefty set of coil springs. It has the old conventional two control arm set up like almost all cars had until the advent of the front wheel drive. It is a smooth running and very dependable choice for a luxury car. It won't handle real sporty cornering, but you would never think of driving this like a sport touring car anyway. It is built for and meant to cruise.

   Why they called it the &quot;Town Car&quot; I do not know, it is an open highway chariot and is set up as such. It is a fully adjustable suspension, which will enable you to keep things right where the engineers wanted them to be. In this day of only being able to set the toe angle, the Lincoln thumbs it's nose at this type of thinking. A twist on the old slotted holes for adjustment has been added. Alignment is now via a set of cams mounted within the body of the upper ball joint, and this translates into a more accurate alignment and one that will stay put over any terrain.

   The factory asks for almost six degrees of caster angle, which by todays standards is a lot. What this means to you is one of the most stable and comfortable rides you have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I would like to see a bigger anti sway bar system up front to keep the sheer heft of this vehicle in check while cornering, but the factory job seems to handle things admirably.

    I do have a few issues with the steering system though. The upper ball joints and also all four tie rods do not allow for any kind of grease service. I can not understand why any auto manufacturer would do this, and from everything I have seen over the last few years most unserviceable chassis parts just do not last. The Town Car is no exception.

    In too many instances the tie rods fail to last more than 50,000 miles with some getting loose enough for replacement in as little as 20,000. Also your upper ball joints will probably need replacement before the warranty expires, so keep this front end regularly inspected with a real good thorough inspection before the time comes up for replacement to be void.

   The rear suspension has so few things to worry about that we won't even give it a mention, it's just the old rear differential type with coils and shocks. Bullet proof and that says it all. The car has a full frame, not one of the modern front and rear subframes and it will add to the strength and safety of this vehicle.

    If you are old school and want a car that will make you feel like there is something substantial under you, this is an excellent choice. It is big and heavy and just what a luxury car is all about. Just make sure to keep checking on your steering system so you won't be surprised on one of your long road trips, because you will be taking many. You can't own a car that begs for the open road and not give it what it wants.<br><br>
