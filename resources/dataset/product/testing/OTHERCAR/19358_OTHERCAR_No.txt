            I felt totally vindicated about this purchase. I read reports, test drove several vehicles, listed all the features that were important to me, and still ended up with a LEMON! After a mere nine visits to the dealership in the first six months, everyone in their service department knew my name. This was not really the close, personal friendship I'd been looking for. While I must admit that the folks in the service department have been nice - I never really wanted to know them as well as I do! 

I brought it in three times for a little connection that worked its way loose - and on the third time went back to the mechanic (in the off limits area) and mentioned that this had happened before (which I had asked to be noted on the work order). He said &quot;oh?&quot; and reassembled it with extra glue on the connection and it's not been a problem since. 

Other little goodies that have gone wrong. My automatic door lock doesn't work anymore. Of course, this is out of warranty now so it isn't covered. The seat belt on the passenger side has a habit of locking up and trying to choke the person sitting there. It has been adjusted several times and is better for a little while then starts on strangling them again. The cover for the sun roof sometimes gets stuck so that I can't open it by hand, I have to use the power switch to loosen it so I can slide it if I want some sun. Plus it's noisier than it used to be.

All in total - my next car will NOT be a Nissan!
