            On my vacation to hawaii I saw a dodge dealership witha viper in the showcase. I went in and leased it for one day. Besides it costing me near 500 bucks I had the time of my life. Going up a hill specified at 15 mph i was taking the hairpin turns at 45 and the tires didnt make a sound. I was up to 70 in 3rd gear!! It just had outstandingly unbelievable performance. You could almost give someone a concuscion just from flooring the accelerator and their head slamming on the head rest. Nothing else compares not even a Ferrari 308 GTB. All around great car. None better except various euro exotics like the mclarens and lambo's etc.<br><br>
