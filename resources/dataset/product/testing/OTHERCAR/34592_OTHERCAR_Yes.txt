            We bought our Saturn SC2 when we could no longer afford the Ford Probe my husband had.  (Please see my review of the Ford Probe.)  My husband and I were still dating at the time, so this was a replacement car for him.  He still wanted a sporty car, but a reliable one.  My sister and her husband had a Saturn SL and had used it hard, and it was still in great condition.  Except for one nasty comment, we'd only heard good things about Saturns.

Since the only sporty option was the SC and my husband wanted as much engine as he could get, we went for the SC2.  We also looked at other models: the Acura Integra used, the new Hyundai Tiburon, and the Mitsubishi Eclipse.  For the money, the Saturn SC2 looked like the best buy.  We test drove the Acura, but we really wanted new.  We also test drove the Tiburon, but it was a horrible drive and incredibly uncomfortable.  With such limited options, we decided on the SC2.

It was very nice to not have to haggle.  All we did was decide what we wanted, and it was a done deal.  We did purchase their car care plan, which is a very reasonable cost.  That made coming up with the money for regular maintainence a non-issue.  Getting scheduled for maintainence was pretty easy, and their waiting area was comfortable.

Other than scheduled maintainence, there was no other trips to the service center.  We did have one problem with the tape deck.  When it was cold out and the car had not been driven over night, the tape player would pop the tape out.  This was annoying.  We asked for repairs and it could not be fixed.  We even had two new tape decks put in with no results.  That was the only problem.

We loved our car!  We drove it several places and it was quite comfortable for the 6 hour trip from Tucson to the Grand Canyon and also moving from Tucson to Omaha, Nebraska.  The only reason we got rid of it was because the car seat we purchased for our baby did not fit in the back seat.  In fact, even the small infant carrier car seats did not fit well in the back.  Getting in and out of the car when pregnant was also no fun deal.  

This is a car for singles and couples with no children and no plans for children any time soon.  If you do have small children, you need a second car for the proper safety seats to fit in.  I imagine a 4-10 year old would sit comfortably in the back seat with no problems.  

I recommend the Saturn to anybody looking for a car.  I don't know much about the other models of Saturn, but the SC2 is a good car.<br><br>
