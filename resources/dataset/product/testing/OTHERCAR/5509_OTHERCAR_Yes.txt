            BASICS:

BODY: None better - without question. This type of vehicle is equipped with a really tough, dent-free, rust-free composite body, and painted with quality coatings (except sometimes for the black roof parts, which on older models may have clearcoat failure).

I once pushed a reflective roadway-construction barrel out of the middle of my lane @ about 20+ MPH (yes, the barrel was in the wrong place) which sent it promptly out of the way, popping it against a concrete divider - intentionally... I aimed for it, because I knew the bumper would take it with no problem. When I got home and checked, there wasn't even a scratch.

INTERIOR: Summed up in one word would be VERSATILE. This type of van came in 3 seating configurations: 3 rear buckets, 5 rear buckets or rear benches (rarest and least versatile). The seats are individually removable, giving the van the ultimate in seating options. The seats weigh about 30 lbs each, which are far lighter than the benches in most other vans.

ENGINE/DRIVE TRAIN: I've always wished to get one with the 3800-series V6, I got one with a 3.1 Litre engine. I was somewhat reserved with the 3.1 Throttle-Body Injection (TBI) models at first, but looking back, I was impressed with its strength and durability. As with most engines, treat them WELL and you'll get reliability in return.

MECHANICAL: The alternator/power steering/compressor/etc units under the hood have been very reliable (never replaced any among them between 2 similar models... only one water pump, and that was very easy to replace. The exhaust is excellent. The transmission shifts fine. There have been no problems with everyday use.

Suspension: No significant problems. Some minor "loose" sound from suspension on bumps when occasionaly when starting out in the morning cold, but went away quickly.

I have found some weaknesses, but they don't effect my opinion significantly:

The leading-edge of the dash may separate from its frame. Re-gluing does not hold down the front edge that starts to curl upward, but can be fixed by drilling holes every 4" (starting from the center) and installing black #8 interior panel screws in a line across the dash front. The repair didn't look bad, and the problem was fixed for $2.95 (available at Pep Boys or other fine auto stores).

Door handles and the rear hatch handle held up on my '93 APV, but generally with this model may break a little more than average. The doors are very solid and relatively heavy. While design may play a factor, I believe some extent of abuse is likely a factor in their failure, for example the rear hatch handle is meant for unlatching the door, but people tend to use it to lift the hatch, instead of using the handhold concealed above the license plate. This causes the handle to eventually fail.

The APV has a console at the bottom-middle of the dash, equipped with well-designed drink holders that will accomodate just about everything but a BigGulp-sized cup.

I really appreciated the APV's form and function, as well as its reasonable performance and fuel efficiency (18-23). In the relatively brief time I owned it, it was trouble-free and an all-around enjoyable and comfortable vehicle to use.

I hope that future minivan designs follow the APV's example (but not necessarily the form), and are designed with more originality than what is being made these days. Like the "plastic" body, there were some great innovations. I wonder why so few vehicles' bodies are designed to resist the elements and abuse so well.
 
Apparently, automaker's quests for healthy market shares have taken the "safe road". I look at what they are selling and I'm bored at first sight. Getting built-in TV's may help the kids "veg out" on the road, but it won't entertain those on the outside, who have to look at what you're driving.
