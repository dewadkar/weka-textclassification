            I bought this camera because I wanted to be able to attach pictures to email without sacrificing quality.  I have not been anything less than completely impressed with this camera since I bought it.  I have taken beautiful pictures without any touchups.  I actually said �wow� out-loud the first time I loaded the pictures onto my computer.  I love the fact that you can view the pictures right on the spot, and delete the ones that don�t turn out.  And transferring the floppy between PC and camera is much easier and cheaper than dealing with the memory cards that other cameras use.

This camera is very easy to use; the on screen menus are easy to understand.  The resolution is incredible.  After printing them on photo film, you can�t tell the difference.  I have seen other photos from other digital cameras and they look �pixilated�, blotchy and computer like.  Not the case with the Mavica FD-88.  

I was a little hesitant to make the jump to digital; prior to this camera I had been using a Minolta Advanced Photo System (the film with three different sizes) camera.  I really liked the quality and clarity that camera produced, but I haven�t touched it since I got my Sony earlier this year.

The only drawback is that the viewfinder can be hard to use in direct sunlight otherwise the viewfinder is great.  I think the video feature is cool, the videos are small enough to send over email, but they are kind of short.  The battery power lasts fairly long; it lasts about 1h 20 minutes fully charged � plenty of time for an outing where you use the camera off and on.  The camera is also durable � I have dropped and bumped the camera a few times, and it has no scars.

If you are seriously considering a digital camera � take a closer look at this model!!
