            I should note before I begin that I am a dyed-in-the-wool Chevy fan. In fact, the only thing I have ever driven is a General Motors product save for the last new van that I bought - a disastrous Plymouth Voyager that I purchased new in 1995 and that gave me 129,000 miles of lemon-scented trouble until the transmission finally failed and I had a reason to be rid of it. On the other side, I own two Chevrolet Astro vans, a 1994 model with over 200,000 miles, and a 2001 model with 55,000 miles. Now that two out of my four kids are driving, I let them use the two Astro vans, while I drive my new 2003 TrailBlazer.

While on the dealer's lot, I looked at a gorgeous blue and silver LTZ model with gray leather interior, DVD player, loaded with every option, until I looked at the sticker. <i>$38,000?!</i> There's no way I could afford that. So the nice salesman showed me an LS model with four-wheel drive in Light Pewter Metallic. The sticker was much more palatable at just over $30,000. After dealer discounts, rebates and my GM card rebate of $1,000, I waltzed out of the dealership with my new T-Blazer for $23,500. I've had it for one month and 2,500 miles now, and here are my impressions:

<b>Exterior:</b> 8.5
Even in base LS trim, the T-Blazer is a very inviting-looking piece. Clean lines, with a muscular front-end grille and headlight treatment, with no extraneous side cladding to muck things up. 16" alloy wheels with white-outlined tires look sporty and rugged. If I had a complaint, it would be that, on the LS model, the holes where the fog lights go on the LT and LTZ models are somewhat tacky looking, with their plastic latticework.

<b>Interior:</b> 9.5
This is where the new TB shines the greatest over the previous generation Blazer. I owned a Blazer for a short time in 1995, and I looked very long and hard at a preowned 2001 model. In both models I disliked the interior design and the quality of the materials - even in the 2001 model I found the materials to be more similar to those used in my 1994 Astro - definitely not befitting a 2001 model that originally sold for over $33,000. I also found the looks of the interior to be very unappealing and excessively utilitarian. Enter the 2003 T-Blazer. The new interior design is a vast improvement over the last generation, with a welcome upgrade in material quality and attention to assembly detail. There is not a squeak or a rattle to be heard in my vehicle. The controls are all very easy to understand and fall readily to hand, especially the climate controls, which include dual-zone temperature sliders and two knobs controlling fan speed and ventilation. In addition, the console shifter and parking brake are nice, sporty touches that add a nice touch to what is basically a utilitarian vehicle. Moreover, the rear seat is a surprisingly comfortable place to be, or so my four boys tell me. Rear seat passengers have their own air conditioning vents and ventilation controls. 

Complaints? I really wish that a seat height adjuster was available on the base LS model, seeing as how, at 5'6", I'm rather short and would like at least the capability to raise and tilt the driver's seat. Also, I would like an outside temperature gauge and a compass. These last two items are available, but at a cost of $1,700 (the cost of mandatory OnStar and a power sunroof - two options I was not interested in). 

<b>Powertrain:</b> 9.0
Lately known for its powerful pushrod small-block V8 engines, Chevrolet chose to take a different direction with the new T-Blazer. Under the hood resides a 4.2 liter in-line six-cylinder engine. This engine utilizes four valves per cylinder and double overhead camshafts to develop 270 horsepower and 275 foot-pounds of torque. This translates into smooth, powerful acceleration and passing performance. This engine is rated to tow at least 5,200 pounds. Routing the power to the rear wheels (or all four wheels) is a smooth-shifting four-speed automatic transmission. On 4WD models, an Autotrac transfer case features an idiot-proof dial giving the driver a choice of automatic 4WD, 4WD high and low, and 2WD high. 

<b>Driving Experience:</b> 8.5
Light-years ahead of the Blazer, the T-Blazer feels much more stable and buttoned down than the Blazer, which had the potential to be a real wild ride when driven aggressively. The T-Blazer rides very smoothly and quietly, with barely any noise coming from the engine. The suspension has been derided by some as being old-fashioned, but it seems to soak up the bumps just fine. As with any SUV, you'll never confuse this with a Corvette or even an Impala, but you won't feel like you're driving a bus.

<b>Value:</b> 9.0
My TrailBlazer listed at about $30,800, an LS with the 1SC package, which included power windows, locks and heated side mirrors, as well as keyless entry and a cargo cover. As I mentioned, I paid under $24,000 for this vehicle. I would consider this a very strong value for a competent, midsize vehicle.

In closing, I would give this strong effort from Chevrolet a solid 9 out of 10.
