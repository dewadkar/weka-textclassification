            The Celica is a great little car! I Bought it with 50,000 miles and it's just like new. The Celica is an inexpensive way to get into the convertible you've always wanted. Good pick up and handling. Celica is a bit noisy, but that's allowed in a sporty car. The seating in back is very tight for an average sized person; front seats can be adjusted comfortably. For a sports car, there is plenty of trunk room. Compared to other convertibles, the reliability is excellent. I fully expect to take this car through 150,000 miles.<br><br>
