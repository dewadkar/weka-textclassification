            This cars small size but large cargo space makes the ideal car for a college student. My daughter goes to a college in Ohio. Like most college towns parking spaces are in shot supply. The Rav4 also makes getting around town a breeze. Toyota's impressive record for mantaince takes a load off my mind knowing that she is driving a very dependble car. this Rav4 is the 4 WD modle. The controls are well laid out and easy to use. The sound system is first rate. The engine is a little noise at high rmps but overall we have not found this to be much of a problem. we get around 22 mpg whic I fell is great for the class of car this is. If you have a son or daughter off at college, need to carry alot, but do not want a monster suv this is the car for you.<br><br>
