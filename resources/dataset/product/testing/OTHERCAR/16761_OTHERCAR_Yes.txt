            If you are looking forward to adding some nice features to your regular newsletter, e-mails to family members living in other parts of the country, keeping track of the growth of your flowers in your garden or just sharing pictures of your upcoming travel and celebrations, the Olympus Camedia C-4000 is the <b>right digital camera for you.</b>.  I have used it to capture work-related pictures on various work projects and assignments.  I have been pretty satisfied with the way the pictures turn out.  Until now, I have remained surprised by its ease of use, capacity and overall performance.  It makes sense that it belongs to the Olympus family of digital hardware.

<b>This camera is great for e-mailing and printing</b>

Most of the people who have been using digital imaging have done so because of the simplicity and ease of the cameras.  With the Olympus Camedia 4000, not only will you have ease of use you will also have great outputs.  <i>The camera has a 4.1 megapixel resolution which will allow you to have up to 20x30-inches prints.  If you are into working on various photography projects, you won't feel disappointed by the finished products.</i>  Featuring 3x optical, 3.3x digital zoom and 1.8 LCD, 16 MB smartmedia card and 6 program scene modes, plus movie mode, this camera has strong appeals in its delivery of color and clarity.  

If you feel like making small movies, you can do so with this Olympus Camedia.  It allows you to record movies with Quicktime Movie mode.  The LCD viewfinder allows you to focus on the object or scenes you want to shoot.  In addition, if you don't want to mess around with the camera, you can always use the automatic, point-and-shoot the camera comes equipped with.  However, if you are a pro or are familiar with digital cameras, you can show your creative juices by working with the manual controls.  Why not after all?  You'll be able to get it to do what you want in terms of how much light, clarity and focus you want.  With 4.1 megapixel, you can expect to take up to 30 and 59 great pictures with 64mb.  If you have 32 mb, just think about 15 to 29 pictures.  My rule of thumb is to take about 20 pictures.

<b>Taking the Olympus on the road</b>

So far, I have been very satisfied with the pictures of this camera.  I have taken pictures of luncheons, races such as Track and Field and Komen, Soccer players and Real Estate.  In fact, this camera makes a good marriage between real estate agents and clients.  On a few occasions, all I had to do was to go take some shots and mail them out to the potential clients.  Once I have sent them the pics, they decide which houses to physically see.  The process of elimination is good both for me and the potential buyers.  Who said that the old, low tech world of Real Estate would not benefit from the cutting-edge tech of digital imaging?

That's not the end of the many uses that this camera has seen.  Just recently, a buddy of mine who has been auctioning cattle in the traditional brick and mortar setting decided to try something different.  He took pictures of his cattle and organized a live auction.  Even though he could not convince all the traditional farmers to align with him, he had a great turnout.  It's something he plans on doing again.  Besides this fancy auction thing, he got to update his own website with pictures of cattle and other products he has for sale.  Now, it's high-tech in the agribusiness world!

<b>Tell me about shutter lag and batteries</b>

We all know how it used to work in the early days of digital imaging.  It's not too long ago when we had to struggle and wait between the time we pressed the button and the actual taking of the picture.  Well, in just over a few years, many improvements have been brought to the digital camera industry.  I am glad to report that the Olympus C4000 Digital Camera will not make you reminisce about these long-forgotten days.  If you don't have to worry about the shutter lag, you may want to invest in spare batteries if you are planning on hitting the roads.  The more you use the LCD, the faster the batteries will run out of juice.  It's a well-documented fact.  The solution to this problem is to have some extras on hand. 

<b>Battery Types</b>:  Fortunately, you will be able to use various types of batteries with this camera.  Obviously, some will last longer than the others.  With this camera, you will be able to use <i>4 X AA NIMH rechargeable batteries, 4 X AA Alkaline batteries, 4 X AA Lithim batteries, 4 X AA NiCD rechargeable batteries.</i>

<b>What else to say about this camera?</b>

Image format.  Your images will be saved as JPEG and TIFF for movies.  Storage capacity: 16 MB.  Flash is included.  Disk Media Type:  SmartMedia.  Platform:  PC and Mac.

This is a decent camera to invest in.  It will be around for some time.  It will allow you to share the greatest moments of your life with your loved ones and friends.  At the same time, if you want to take pictures for your business and your postings on ebay.com, you will be able to do all of that and more.
