            Throughout Dodge's history, they have created some of the most powerful monsters on the road. Using the hemi in some of their models only made them more appealing to those power hungry manly men (as well as some women). However, when you increase power, you lose fuel mileage right? Everyone has heard the term gas guzzler, primarily for large engines whose fuel consumption is in comparison to that really big trucker who can down a table full to get the free meal. But, when Dodge introduced the Daytona, were they really thinking about all this? I guess so! 

The Daytona was available with the V-6 181 cid Mitubishi engine beginning in 1990. While it wasn't quite as strong as the smaller turbo-charged engines, it had raw untapped power that can be brought out through a few engine modifications. While you can easily get 200 hp out of this engine, it still retains fuel mileage fairly well. My 1990 V-6 Daytona ES has approximately 110,000 miles on it and is running at about 175 hp, 33 hp above stock. This engine still gets about 17 mpg, and the only reason for that is it is running quite rich at the time. These cars, in stock setup, get 19/26 mpg with an automatic 4-speed and a V-6 engine. Anyone who owns a V-6 knows this is great mileage for a 13 year old car. 

While this car seems great so far, there are a few things to look out for. I guess while Dodge was focusing so much time and money into getting a fuel economic car, they really must have neglected the electronic controls. I have never seen a car with so many switches that don't work. In my car, the wipers don't work on intermittent, the electric seats don't move (you can still lift move the back and it still slides back and forth, so it's really not THAT big of a deal, but...I'm trying to illustrate a point here...), the window switch on the passenger side doesn't work, but it is still operational from the driver's side. Also, the electric locks don't work from either side and the mirror switch fails to move the mirrors as well. Besides that, the paint flakes off, but the body is still in great condition and only had a very small patch of surface rust, which was taken care of with some sandpaper and spraypaint, atleast until I can get it painted professionally.

If you are looking for a great daily driver with good fuel economy, then look no further. The Dodge Daytona is a fantastic car that handles and accelerates like a sports car, but rides smoothly like a luxury. Well, except for the back seats, which I think would be cruel and inhumane for me to put anyone back there without moving the front seats up. But other than that, it is a great car, inside and out.
