            This is my first review so please bear with me.  I bought a 1999.5 Super black Pathfinder this last August and I LOVE IT!  I went with the SE model with the popular package and sunroof which gives you the fog lights as well as the additional sun visor, which believe it or not comes in very handy.  I drive in excess of 50,000 miles per year and live in the mountains so I had to have a truck that was comfortable as well as 4 wheel drive.  This truck fits the bill completely.  I looked for over 3 months and test drove EVERY truck out there and none could compare in quality and price.  Nissan runs some great incentive programs almost all year so it wasn't like I had to wait for a special promotion.  The only truck that came in close was the 4 runner which to be comparable had to be the limited edition which runs over $40,000 and doesn't even ride half as well.

In addition, I just traded my 1993 pathfinder SE for this truck and it had over 150,000 miles on it and still ran great, so I have faith that this one will be just as good if not better.

Now, for the not so good.  I felt a bit gipped by the configuration of the packages that are offered.  I only wanted a sunroof and fog lights but they are bundled together so that you get stuff that isn't totally needed, like the power antenna.  Also, the engine is a bit on the weak side but not that bad.  It can get into traffic and merge, you just can't beat a car from the line or anything like that.  I have also had vast experience with really fast cars so I could be a bit biased.

Please test drive one, you will not be disappointed!!
