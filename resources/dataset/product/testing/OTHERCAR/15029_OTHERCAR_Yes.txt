            My Sony Mavica MVC-FD73 is one of the best purchases I've made from Sony. This state-of-the-art digital camera is compact, customer friendly and has taken some of the best pictures of my family and friends that I've ever seen. There are many special features including:

Five picture effects:

1. Negative... can take some creepy pictures!
2. Sepia... instead of your average black &amp; white, sepia gives a golden tint to a b&amp;w.
3. Black and white... self explanatory.
4. Color... see above.
5. Solarize... I'm not sure what the purpose of this is. Looks to me like a grainy color pic.

Six Modes for different atmospheres:
1. Soft Portrait Mode... Creates a soft background to highlight the subject of the picture.
2. Sports Lesson Mode... This increases the shutter speed in order to take action shots without the blur.
3. Beach and Ski Mode... This dulls the brightness found on beaches and ski slopes due to high amounts of reflection and light.
4. Landscape Mode... For distance subjects or to take pictures through windows and screens.
5. Panfocus Mode... Mainly used at night to bring out of focus shots in focus and also increases focus in long distance and zoomed photos.
 
I also use the Sony Mavica MVC-FD73 to get pictures on the internet for Ebay auctions and website design. There are so many different digital cameras on the market... I've used several of them also... Agfa Ephoto, Canon Powershot and Sony Cybershot. But out of all them, the Mavica has the most options, takes the best pictures and what more could you want? Picture quality is what I value most and if you feel the same way, the Mavica is the digital camera for you... decent price for great value.<br><br>
