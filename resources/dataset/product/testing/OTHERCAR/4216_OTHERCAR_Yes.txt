            My husband bought me one of these for my Anniversary, Birthday and Christmas Gift combined!  I must say that I am in love with this van!  I would never trade it in for anything unless it was a newer model!

I am handicapped and could not get into a regular sized van, but this!  I can get in and out of with not problem!  It is in my favorite color, green!  

I love the dual air control for the driver and passenger!  My husband is always cold and I am always hot!  With this, both of us can be comfortable all the time!  There is even a/c for the passengers in the back!

It drives like a dream, however there is only one thing that I must say, that I do not like about it...that is that the turning range is not as good as a car.  Other than that, I am so happy and content with my van!

I go everywhere in it!  I've gone camping, to the drive in movies, you name it, I've been there, except off road driving, of course!

I feel so safe in it and so does anyone who rides with me.  It handles the road beautifully!  I have not had a single problem with this van, except maybe keeping gas in it because I drive so much!

My father in law had one last year and he let me test drive it...little did he know he was creating a monster!  

I will forever be sold on this van and will be trading mine in for a newer model in a few years!<br><br>
