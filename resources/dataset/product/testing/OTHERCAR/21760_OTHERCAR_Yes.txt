<TEXT>
            Before I purchased my 1998 Cavalier, I researched other cars in the same price category and decided that for the money, reliablity, safety, and great looks, that it was the best buy...and I have never regreted it!!  My Cavalier is two years old now, and I have never had a problem with it.  It gets great gas mileage, starts beautifully everytime, and all the interior and exterior is holding up well.  I have the 2.2L, 5 speed and I have never been disappointed by the performance or agility.  Chevy makes a great vehicle for the money (I also own an S-10) and you get every bit of what you pay for.  I am extremly happy with my wonderful little car, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to buy one new or used!!<br><br>
