            You can get the specs on this car from a car website. I would like to give you a mother's perspective on this SUV.

I spent a lot of time shopping around for a car by visiting web sites, test driving cars, and reading Consumer Reports.  My goal was to buy a car or SUV that could handle the bad weather, be reliable, and easy to drive.

Since I am the parent of only one child, and I don't intend on having any more children,  I did not need a big vehicle like an Expedition or a minivan.  I focused on finding an all-wheel drive, or four-wheel drive vehicle.  It is important for my husband to be able to get to work in all conditions, so handling well in the snow was a must.

WEATHER:  My CR-V has been driven in snow many times.  I see lots of people in minivans along roadways that are stuck during this type of weather.  The CR-V plods along, and does quite nicely in this weather.  In the rain, the anti-lock brakes have helped this CR-V EX (comes standard with this model) stop well.  My husband, who has an Acura Integra, claims my car does not stop as well as his car.  I keep safe distances from the cars in front of me, so stopping has not been an issue.  

SIZE:  I have been happy with the spacious interior of the CR-V when there are four people in it.  But, I have noticed there is a very tight squeeze when there are three adults in the back seat, or three children (two of who are in car seats).  If I had more than one child, I would probably look for a car with more interior space in the back seat, or one that offers a second back seat. I have taken the CR-V on a eight hour vacation drive with a total of three adults and my child.  We were just able to get in all of the luggage without using the roof rack.  The visibility in the car is better than average.  You can see over cars, but cannot see over trucks, minivans, and larger SUVs.  

CONTROL PANELS:  Generally they are easy to use.  I have pushed some wrong buttons on my radio, and don't find it the easiest to use.  But, otherwise, the buttons make sense.

COMFORT:  My husband finds the driver's seat uncomfortable, and non-supportive.  I frankly don't notice this feature in any car, so I defer to his opinion in this area.

TAILGATE:  Oddly, it opens to one side, and not up like most SUVs.  It can be inconvenient when I pull the CR-V in the garage, and want to shut the garage door before I unload the car.  Also, when I load the car at the grocery, I am always afraid that someone will lop off my tailgate.

SEAT BELTS:  The CR-V has a lifetime warranty on the seat belts.  I have to take my vehicle into the dealer, because the seat belts in the rear lock-up very easily, so the passenger cannot move forward at all.

ACCELERATION:  I need a vehicle that can merge on high-speed highways, and I am quite comfortable with the CR-V.  If you are buying a used CR-V, watch out, since I think some of the earlier models have a smaller horsepower.  

RELIABILITY:  At 25,000 my CR-V has had no problems to date.  

HANDLING:  I am comfortable with the handling of this vehicle, but I would not say that it is the best feature.  When I drive on windy roads, I don't have the best feel of the road.  You have to take your time when you drive on this type of roadway.  In comparison to the Mercedes SUV, I would say the handling of the CR-V is better.  But, if you compare the CR-V to a sporty car like the Audi A4 or Acura Integra, I would say the handling of the CR-V is a lot worse.  

BUYING:  I you decide on this vehicle be sure to shop around, and try Microsoft Carpoint.  I bought my car using this method, and was very happy with the purchase price. Make sure you check the latest Consumer Reports to see if there are any other SUVs out there with good reliability records.
