            I spent considerable time researching various automobiles before making a purchase. In the end, the Audi A4 1.8T Quattro met or exceeded all of my criteria. After driving this vehicle for almost four months now, I am pleased to say that it continues to please. What is especially notable now are the little details that are not so apparent at first glance. Audi obviously spends a great deal of time finessing the design details of its autos. The interior ergonomics are very well thought out. Placement of all the components is precise and efficient. The 2001 A4 is a marvel at providing the driver with every bit of information about the vehicle. I am always given sufficient warning of such things as low windshield washer fluid, low oil level, service intervals, etc. Climate control is precise and realistic. Audio components are complete without being superficial and the sound is outstanding. Overall comfort is exceptional and surprising for a car of its size. My two children can sit in the back seat with a friend between them and never complain of being cramped or uncomfortable. Many of the interior features are cleverly tucked away making the most efficient use of space.
Performance is, of course, one of the things that distinguishes this car from most others on the road. I originally thought I would want the 2.8 litre A4 but was told by the dealer that I would probably find the 1.8T more �fun� to drive. With the sports package (Sport tuned suspension and 16" 10-spoke wheels) I have found this car to be an absolute joy to drive. It is responsive and with a 190 hp turbocharged engine, packs a great deal of punch when necessary. Steering is tight and responsive and the car hugs the road well. With the Quattro (all-wheel drive), handling on questionable surfaces is unprecedented. This is especially important when driving on our ice and snow covered Canadian roads. However, handling and braking are greatly improved by upgrading to the special winter tires (approx. $1,000).
One of my final, and most important considerations was safety. With two young children, I wanted a vehicle that afforded me a certain peace of mind. I discovered through my insurance agent that the A4 is considered to be one of the safest cars on the road today, second only to Volvo. This fact actually translated into a significantly lower annual insurance premium, about $600 less than I was expecting.
In all, the A4 was a bit more money than I originally planned on spending, but after four months I am more than satisfied that I am getting great value for what I spent.
