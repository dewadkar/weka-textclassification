            I just bought this car, and I must say that I am VERY happy with it. 
It looks great, handles great, and when you put the sunroof down and let the sun beat in there's nothing like it!

I opted for the leather seats, and looking back I'm glad I did. They just add so much to the looks of the car.

The car is small, so if your looking for a family car I would rule this one out for sure.
But if your more interested in fun, and sleak, then by all means test drive this car. It comes with a CD player which sounds great, lots of space for your sunglasses and such, and a great dashboard layout. The headlights are exceptional, in that they are very bright, and the steering is tight with the car handling like an absoloute dream.

The only downfall to this car is that it's not as fast as it looks. My old car was a 1991 Eagle Talon and it had WAY more power than the Tiburon. Other than that, this car is great looking, and as tight as a drum.
