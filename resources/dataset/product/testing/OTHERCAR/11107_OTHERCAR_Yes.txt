            I bought a Konica Q-Mini in Sept. 2000 while on the lookout for an affordable way for my high school tech students to capture pictures for Web pages.
While Sony cameras are nicer (optical zoom) and write pictures to floppies, they were outside my price range of $250-$350 U.S. I wanted a camera so inexpensive that I could buy several of them.
The Q-Mini impressed me with its easy-to-use (+) and (-) buttons to scroll through pictures or features. The auto white balance and exposure were surprisingly accurate. The color gradients were very true, with almost no visible pixel patches in the JPEG images it created. Auto exposure and shutter adjusted automatically in low light to give almost daylight-looking street shots at 2 a.m.
It has a video-out jack to preview your shots or give a &quot;slide show&quot; on any TV. The LCD screen has a handy brightness control. You can erase pictures you don't like in order to save space on the removable FlashRom card.
The only criticisms are its high battery use (less than one hour of continuous operation on three Energizer AAs) and expensive ($50) DC adapter. Also, make sure the camera is packaged with the right cord to download your pictures. Mine had only a Macintosh cord, although the dealer gladly switched it when I noticed the mistake.
Although not a pro camera, I feel the Q-Mini would be an excellent-for-the-price camera for tourists, teenagers, Web-page designers, and any place medium resolution (640 x 480) is sufficient.<br><br>
