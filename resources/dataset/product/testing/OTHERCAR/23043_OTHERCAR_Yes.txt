            I bought this product because I was new to digital cameras, and this one seemed easy to use, and very low in price.  I think I paid around $60 on an internet auction site for a refurbished camera, and it was well worth the price.

The camera is very easy to use, and of course, Polaroid has excellent customer service.  The only problem I had with the camera is my fault.  I was using an adapter that was too powerful, and it fried the camera.  Polaroid happily replaced the camera FOR FREE, with a brand-new camera.  And within 3 days of me calling customer service.

I love this product because it is *so* easy to use.  The only bad thing is   it drains battery power very quickly.  But so does everything else.

You should buy this camera if you are uncomfortable with a digital camera, but want to learn more.  It is easy to use, fun, and easy to upload pictures into your computer.<br><br>
