            In late 1997 I was looking for a sedan for my fiance.  After driving some of its competitors (MB C280, BMW 328i, Audi A4, etc.) we decided to give the Volvo a try.  We liked the fact that the Volvo was roomier than the German competitors and provided a lot of car for less money (except for the Audi A4, which was wonderful but a little too small for her taste).  My fiance and I drove all three S70s available at the time: GT, GLT and T5.

The base S70 (GT?) with the normally aspirated engine was very smooth, comfortable, and felt every bit as solid as we had expected.  The particular model we drove did not have many options but was still a very nice car.  The velour seats were outstanding and the new more rounded dash (compared to the 850 it evolved from) was very pleasing to the eye.  It was priced around $31,000.

We then drove a GLT with almost every option short of the cold weather package (we live in south Florida).  The same seats now covered in leather felt great.  The dash also had the burl walnut wood trim, which livened up the interior quite a bit.  It also had the optional CD player/tape deck radio, automatic climate control, power driver's (with 3 memory settings) and passenger's seats, sunroof, rear spoiler/fog light combination and, of course, the wonderful low pressure turbocharged and intercooled engine.  It accelerated considerably better and still maintained all the other wonderful qualities of the base car.  This one was priced at around $37,000.

Last we drove the S70 T5.  Equipped the same as the GLT but with four very noticeable differences: leather steering wheel/shift knob, trip computer, 16&quot; wheels and the high pressure turbo engine.  The main thing we noticed about the T5 is that up to 60mph, its additional 46hp was not too advantageous over the GLT, with engine noise being far more intrusive in the cabin.  Above 60mph is where the T5 began pulling a lot harder than the GLT.  The T5 was priced around $39,000.  If it had been a 5 speed I might have taken it home.

We chose the GLT and drove it home for just over $34,000.  We have since put 45K miles on the car and here is my experience with the car:

Every day.  The car rides very well on all but the roughest surfaces.  When you encounter small irregularities the ride does become harsher than expected.  Other than that, the car rides beautifully.  It is an excellent car for a daily driver.  Cold a/c, excellent seats, fast, safe and good ride.  One thing I would change on the inside of the car is the location of the emergency flashers button.  It sits directly in front of the shifter and sometimes when placing the car in park, you can hit the button.  The turning radius is probably the worst feature on this car.  I have an old BMW 733i which is considerably bigger than the Volvo, yet turns considerably better too.

Reliability.  The Volvo has never left us stranded or needed one tow since new.  It has been a little less reliable than we expected in other areas though.  I have taken it in to the dealer for the air conditioning four times.  The first time was around 15K miles when the air just stopped blowing cold.  Dealer took care of that.  Around 20K miles, the a/c began making funny noises, but at least it was blowing cold.  It took three trips to the dealer to correct it.  Finally, at the 35K service the found the problem.  An expansion valve was getting stuck and continually made a squeaking noise.  It has been fine since.

The original Michelins wore out around 35K miles and that has been the only major expense other than regular scheduled maintenance.  Even scheduled maintenance is not that outrageous for an imported car.  The most expensive bill I have had was around $380 for the 30K mile service, balance and rotation of the tires and an alignment.  Dealer service has been outstanding to say the least.  New loaner Volvos have always been provided when I schedule a dealer visit.  Not one negative experience with the service department.

Other niggling problems have dealt with the lights.  The first problem dealt with a turn signal flashing too fast.  All the bulbs were ok and the dealer informed me that it was a well known problem and replaced the bulb receptacle.  They corrected it on the first try.  In 45K miles I have replaced two fog light bulbs, even though we only use the fog lights in heavy rain, both headlight bulbs and now need to replace one of the brake bulbs.  It all seems trivial but since the rest of the car is so wonderful, it is a pain in the rear to keep replacing these little bulbs (which are not cheap by the way - although I only had to pay for one, dealer replaced the rest at no charge).  I've never had a car that consumed bulbs with such a voracious appetite.

The radio, which others claim to be excellent, is average at best.  I have driven other S70s, including a couple of loaners, and all had the same mediocre sound.  It's not that it sounds bad, it's just that it's not up to par with some of the stereos available today.  The stereo in my 98 Mustang GT blows this one away easily.

Other than that the Volvo has more than lived up to our expectations.  It is a deceptively quick car that is almost invisible to the radar gun.  The car is very comfortable with some of the best seats I have ever had the pleasure to take a long trip in.  Fuel economy has been outstanding, averaging around 24mpg, even with the occasional trips to the redline.  Even though they have become relatively expensive, especially when compared to the newer sedans from the competitors, I would still definitely recommend the S70, especially the GLT or T5.<br><br>
