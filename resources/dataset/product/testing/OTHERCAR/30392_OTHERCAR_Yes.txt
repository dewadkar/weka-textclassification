            I bought the Pontiac Aztek because it has the height of a sport utility but has a lot of features you would find in a car or mini van. After test driving several cars,trucks,vans and sport utility vehicles we came to the conclusion that the Aztek is all of those put together. We just could not believe the features and extra items that can be added to make this a vehicle you could use just about any way you would choose. Camping...get the tent package. Hiking...get the backpacks. Biking...get the bike racks.There are also a lot of standard things that make the Aztec unique. There are radio controls in the back for your tailgate party! We love our new Aztek and would recommend this driving experience to anyone who enjoys a little fun and adventure,plus don't mind people stopping you to ask a few questions like &quot;What is that&quot;or&quot;How do you like it&quot;. Of course you know my answers to these questions.<br><br>
