            Hi my name is matt. My parents recently bought a 2000 Chevy Venture. It is a great car. We got the touring susupesion so it rides great! We also got the automatic sliding door which is a great feature. I snowboard so when my parents take me and my friends somtimes we have 5 snowgoards in the bar and with the flip and fold seat they all fit in the back perfecty.also the 8 passanger seating is great because thier are so many seating options. Well i really recomend this car and i think it rides great. and this is great for a family of 5 or more<br><br>
