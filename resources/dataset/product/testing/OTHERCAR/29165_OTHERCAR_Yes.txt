            My car:

1992 Shadow ES Turbo, 4-door

From the time I test drove this car to the time eventually traded it in, (which I hated to do) I absolutely loved this car. On the first test drive, I was extremely impressed with the way it handled. I was amazed at how it took the turns, and just stayed there. 

The seats were very comfortable for a small car. The front were both power bucket seats, that reclined. But you could take a nice long drive and be very comfortable. The Wife & I decided to take a mini vacation, and went off to a remote area roughly 250 miles from home. When we got to our destination, we both started to brag about how nothing hurt!
It was a pleasure to drive that distance, as the front allowed plenty of leg room for me, and average height man.

The rear seats flipped down, so you could open up the rear hatch, and load quite a bit of stuff in there. In fact I hauled a 27" console TV in there, and was still able to close the hatch!

As we were traveling down country roads, and 2 lane highways, the need to pass someone always comes into play. As I began to accelerate, the car just went like the wind, as the turbo charger kicked in, you could feel yourself pressing into the seats a bit. We passed that gentleman with the greatest of ease. After a second pass, I noticed that all that acceleration and speed came about without ever leaving 3rd gear! It did not shift into passing gear either time, the turbo did all the work! 

So, of course after noticing that, being a guy, I had to do it again, only this time using both passing gear and turbo. All I can say is....WHOA! That little car took off like I've never experienced before, this time our heads kind of whipped back as all that power kicked in at once! Wow.

The tires it came with were Goodyear Eagle GT's, H-rated for higher speed, and they were good for that, but they were the worst tire I've used in the snow and rain. Hydroplaning was common, and snow traction for a front wheel drive vehicle, was less than average. I really noticed it when I replaced them with something much better.

My car was loaded with all the bells & whistles available for that car. In all the time I owned it, only normal wear maintenance (tires, brakes, etc.) was necessary. It served to be a good quality vehicle for me, and I regret that I had to trade it in.

Why did I trade it in if I liked it so much? Well, I had to move approximately 55 miles (one way)from work, in search of a home I could afford. The first day I went to work, I gassed up, drove to work, and when I got home, I noticed I had used roughly a half of a tank of gas! It was then that I knew that I could not afford to keep that car, as much as I loved it, it had to go.
