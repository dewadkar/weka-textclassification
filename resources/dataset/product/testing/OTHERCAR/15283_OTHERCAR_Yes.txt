            Sony's idea of developing a digital camera that could utilize a floppy disk is what first attracted me to the Mavica FD81. If you have no patience with memory sticks, wires, special connections, and software, this is the camera for you. The image quality may not be as good as some other cameras on the market, but it's better than decent. You can choose between Standard and Fine image quality, depending on the importance of what you're shooting. The images tend to be a little heavier in the Fine mode, but definitely of higher quality.You can also choose between four image effects: regular color, black and white, sepia tone, and solarization. So it offers lots of versatility for artful shots. The MPEG feature works well, and can record up to a minute's worth of video on a single floppy. The battery is good for hundreds of shots before recharging.

When you've finished, simply take out the floppy, pop it in your PC, and view it through your A: drive and image viewer. You can copy it to your hard drive, erase the floppy, and use it again and again. The image quality is good enough for the average user. Under ideal lighting conditions, I've found the quality to be excellent. The FD81 is user friendly, and simple enough for a child to use with minimal instruction.<br><br>
