            My particular version is a 4x4, but I've never really given it a healthy off-road test.  You'll have to look at other reviews for any info on that. 

As I write this, it is December 2002, and I've owned my Jeep for about a year. Mine has over 100,000 miles on it, and it still drives and looks like a brand new car. In my book, that's a testimony in itself.  For me, reliability is the number one feature I look for in a car, and the jeep passes that test with flying colors. It starts every time I turn the key , it stops smoothly every time I hit the brakes, all the accessories function like it just came off the assembly line, and it has absolutely no recurring mechanical problems. It's solid as a rock. For my particular tastes, that's a perfect car.

Since I've already let you know that I absolutely love this car, I think I'll just list a few specific characteristics that stand out in my mind.

First, the good stuff:
1 - This vehicle is powerful.  The 6 cylinder motor (4.0 L) really pushes the thing.  In fact, if anything, it's a little too powerful.  The back end breaks loose easily if you really step on the gas. I'd feel fine towing just about anything smaller than a cruise ship. Well, maybe that's a little exaggeration, but I would feel fine towing a small or even medium sized boat around.

2 - For a 4x4 it handles really well.  My last car was a Toyota Tercel, so I did need to adjust to the new feel, but now it's natural as can be.  It even handles well in rain.

3 - Visibility is awesome. There are virtually no blind spots.

4 - The fold-down back seat makes for a really nice cargo space in the back.


Okay, now for the not-so-good stuff:


1 - The only problem I've had to fix since I've owned my jeep is a worn out cooling fan.  It cost me 100 bucks to purchase a factory match and took 15 minutes to do the repair.  In my mind, that's just routine maintenance, so. . no problem.

2 - The door hinges are breaking away at the welds. I've seen this in other cherokees before, so I'm thinking it may be the vehicle's only real defect.

3 - A little clunk (very light) happens underneath somewhere.  I think I may need a new universal joint.

4 - Where's my cupholder?!  

5 - The cruise control sometimes makes the automatic transmission shift when I don't think it should.

6 - Gas mileage not too good.  16mpg on average.



Well, that's it.  The good, the bad, . .and. . . heck, there isn't any ugly.  All in all, I'd recommend this thing to anyone.  I'm terribly sad that they've quit making them.  I guess I'll have to buy another 7 year old one in the year 2006.
