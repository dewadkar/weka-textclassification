            About 3 years ago, my  son decided he could no longer keep his VW Rabbit held together, so went on the hunt for a used truck.  He had a big list of &quot;must haves&quot;--automatic, 6 cylinder, and goodies like power windows and tilt steering wheel. 
 Finally, after a long search in used car lots and classifieds, he found the perfect &quot;pre-owned&quot;  truck that he could afford, a  1995 Chevy S-10.  Not only was it loaded, it had a cap and a beautiful teal green paint job.
At first it was babied, {I could only drive it after getting detailed instructions insuring it's safe return with no scratches]. Then, little by little, he began to see the value of the work it could do.  It has hauled tools, lumber, and all kinds of stuff guys seem to want to tote around.  Now it's met another challenge- pulling a trailer with about 800 lbs worth  of mini-race car, the bed  loaded up  with tools and spare car parts, and 2 guys in front.  Even with that it manages the hills on the way to the race track. 
So far this truck has only required basic maintenance.   My son is very pleased with this truck, and when he goes to replace it will definitely buy another Chevy.<br><br>
