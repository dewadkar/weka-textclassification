            I have had my Jeep Wrangle for 3 years now and I still love it. I would not think twice about buying a new one when the time comes that my jeep isn't drivable any more. My jeep is Jade in color with a black top.This vehicle drives smooth and handles curves with ease. If you are looking for a vehicle to get you around the city or even off road I recommend that you at least give the jeep wrangler a try. Take it for a road test, put it through its paces. You can get your jeep with either a hard or soft top. I recommend the soft top for people who like to take the top off and dont have a lot of storage spact to store a hard top. The only negative thing I have found by having a soft top jeep is that the plastic windows make it easy for someone to break in to the jeep and steal whats left lying out in view. Unfortanetly, this happened to me twice. But that isn't Jeeps fault its a choice I made for what I wanted to have. Jeep owners are a freindly sort. Many days I have other jeep drivers wave at me simply because I am driving a jeep.<br><br>
