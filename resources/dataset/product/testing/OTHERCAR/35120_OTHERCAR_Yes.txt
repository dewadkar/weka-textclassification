            I was shopping around on Ebay for interesting items and found this unique Digital camera/printer for real low prices between $110 to $180 between Refurbished and Brand new.

Though I have another two Digital cameras, Olympus Camedia C-2100 and Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-P30 , I decided to get this one as the price was so attractive to give it a try.

I was lucky and got it for $92 from an auction for a dealer who was thowing his stock of Refurbished ones on Ebay.

The Refurbished C-211 comes with 90 days manufacture warranty , means if any problem happened with it you will have to return it back to Olympus , not the shop you bought it from . 

The components are :8mb Smartmedia card,  USB cable, Video cable, Quick start guide, Users guide Camedia 2.0 software, 4 Duracel AA batteries and one Polaroid 500 pack (10 photos) expired by Dec 2001 .

I have the camera for 3 weeks now and it is working perfect. It is extremely easy to use as usual with Olympus cameras and the Quality of pics are excellent . Very important as well to know that Polaroid Films can work very good after their expiry date as well , so although the pack with the camera is expired , the printed photo was of very good quality , so I would advice to buy expired packs as they are usualy much cheaper than those which didn't.

The C-211 doesn't suit those who like moving much , as its size is realy big , even bigger than usual Camcorders . 

Although the camera with its intial component is realy cheap as you can get it for around $150 , which is far less than others of its 2.1 Megapixels category . If you buy it refurbished , then mostly you will need around $100 of extra equipment , which are partly fancy and partialy important.

The extras you will need for it is : Rechargable Batteris with a charger , around $40 value , Carrying bag , $20 , 64 Mb Memory stick to have real storage , $40 .

Remember as well that polaroid films aren't cheap , new ones are usualy for around $14 , down to $2 for expired ones if you buy bulk , which could worth practicaly if you will print with it frequently.


If you don't have a digital camera , so for now , I believe this is the best choice for you as far as the SIZE doesn't matter with you , as you will find all the options you dream in a high quality digital camera  , with additional printing capabilities for real cheap price.

Remember as well you can shot short movies.

I advice always to read more reviews before buying to see different expenices and different Epinions :)

Good Luck
