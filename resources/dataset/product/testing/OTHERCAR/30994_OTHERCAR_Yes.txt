            When Toyota decided to unleash its upgraded Supra in 1993, it was a complete redesign of a car that had previously been built on a shared platform.  Throwing the engineering might of one of the largest and most sophisticated manufacturers behind the effort of building the ultimate sports car, the Supra--particularly the Twin Turbo--emerged as the sports car that set the performance standards by which all others were measured.

Today, with the Supra out of production, used examples offer sports car enthusiasts the opportunity to get into a world class sports car for under $30,000.  But . . . only if you can find one.  I recently sold my Twin Turbo and received almost 100 inquiries within three days of advertising in on two online sites.  While this translates into difficulty in finding a good example, it also means that depreciation is currently a non-factor in the buying decision.

First, the performance figures.  Car & Driver tested an early example at 4.6 seconds in the 0-60 run and various tests placed the lateral acceleration capability of the Twin Turbo at or near 1.0 g.  The top speed was electronically limited to 156 mph, but, depending on who you believe, the unlimited top speed of the car was in the 170-180 mph range (disconnecting the top speed limiter is relatively easy).  On top of this, the Twin Turbo is easy to modify to achieve much greater horsepower and torque.  A large number of owners have done some very simple upgrades to increase the maximum turbo boost, achieving 450 bhp or higher.  There are even a few turbo Supras on the street that produce 600-800 bhp.  While this is great if you're a speed freak, it may also be a concern.  My impression is that there are a large number of Twin Turbos that have been overtweaked and abused.  Be very careful in your buying decision!

The truly fantastic thing about the Supra Twin Turbo is that it's a Toyota.  While the brand's lack of cachet and the resultant difficulty in selling a high-priced sports car wearing that badge certainly contributed to the model's demise, it nonetheless means that the car is blessed by Toyota's high quality and longevity.  Maintenance costs are not particularly high, but some parts--brake rotors, for instance--can be pretty pricey since they're high-performance components.

Although I did not modify my Twin Turbo, I never found a situation in which I had any need for more power.  The braking and handling are razor sharp.  You do pay a price for this performance in the form of a somewhat harsh ride and unwelcome steering feedback over broken pavement, but it's a fair price to pay.

My Twin Turbo had the sport roof option, a removable targa-style top that left the car feeling like a convertible.  It's a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it offered a fun open-air driving experience.  But, on the other hand, removing or replacing the top was a three or four minute operation.  More significantly, the removal of the top significantly reduces the body's stiffness--the twisting of the body manifests itself by a loose feeling that is immediately noticeable once you start cornering hard or drive over rough surfaces.  This takes some of the fun out of the open-air experience.

The seats are comfortable, the stereo is very good, and the overall level of fit and finish is excellent.  The two rear seats are essentially useless.  The Supra affords you all of the benefits of a real sports car, but also exacts many of the penalties that you would expect from this genre.

I loved my Supra, but, alas, practicality overtook me after three years of ownership and I decided that I needed a sports sedan (Chrysler 300M; see my review elsewhere on this site).  I highly recommend the Supra Twin Turbo for anyone who wants a serious sports car, with two caveats:  (1) it's too fast for inexperienced or irresponsible drivers (it's easy to get in over your head); and (2) potential buyers should be very careful in their purchases, since many of the Twin Turbos have been inexpertly modified and/or abused.

One of the great sports cars of the 90's.
