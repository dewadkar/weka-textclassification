            My son bought this car as a project car and recently got it all fixed up.

The motor in it looks brand new. There is not a speck of grease on it. He purchased it from someone who was selling it because the car had been vandalized.

My son replaced the seats and windows in it. It has a new convertible top on it.  Also a new right front panel.  Once he ran down the electrical problem in the car it runs excellent.

He was going to take it and get it painted this week while he was on vacation, but the new neighbors across the street backed into it and knocked the rear light completely off the car. This made a new rear light and the whole assembly necessary. He was not a happy camper. After all that work and someone was not paying attention.

In the meantime, my car started to act up and I had to drive this car to work. Temporary plates on it and no turn signals. I went the back way every day , I thought that I would stick out like a sore thumb.

O.K. Now for the details of the car, since you have the background on the car. It has 144,000 miles on it. Everything in the car is Power.  Power Seats, Power Windows, Digital Readout on the dash board. It has a electronic meter in it that tells you how much mileage you are getting at all times. The convertible top is extremely easy to put down. You just undo two latches and hit the switch and the top is down.

Comfort: I think that the seats are comfortable enough but they would probably be more comfortable if I could adjust them right. I don�t like to adjust things when I am driving. 

As soon as you open the car door to get in the digital dash board lights up. It tells you how much gas you have in the car. What your oil level is and your temperature level.. Once you start the car and you are driving , the car doors lock automatically when you reach 17 miles an hour.

The car has all sorts of fancy things on it that I like. I am just thinking that if that digital readout goes out it is a bugger to be replaced..

I really like the car and think that for as old as it is , it is a well built car. I am a Ford person myself but this one is a O.K. car. Besides beggers cant be choosers.

The car has a rear window defroster in it and air conditioning. Yes you still need an air conditioner on a scorching hot day when the top is down. This car is getting about 22 miles to the gallon on the highway, I have not taken it out on the freeway yet so I don�t know how that will go. I imagine maybe 35 .  I do notice on the meter inside that the gas mileage goes up when you are coasting and I live on a hill so everywhere is down.  I should save lots of money by coasting.

The car handles well on the corners as well as the highway. It is a little bumpy, but I think that is because it may need shocks.

The interior of the car is nice in all Gray. The seats are a real nice material also in Gray. They can recline, be raised up or down and tilted.  There are buttons on the drivers side for all the windows and all the outside mirrors so that they can be adjusted automatically.

The car has a driver side air bag in it but none on the passenger side of the car Since this car is over 10 years old, I think that it has more then stood up to the test of time. There have been things that have been replaced on it, but most of them were due to vandals..

If he does not sell it this weekend then I am going to buy it.
