            Well my story starts back in 1978.  My first car.  At the time, I couldn't afford much, but I knew that I wanted a Honda.  So I went to my local dealer and looked at the choices they had.  Well a Honda Civic CVCC caught my eye. It was white with blue pin stripes. It called to me. So I bought it. It was a very fun car to drive, my first 4 speed, what a time learning stick!!! I drove it for two years.

Then in 1980 my Mom's car died so she needed a new one.  Well that was the year the Prelude caught my eye this time.  It had come out just a year earlier.  I knew I had to have it.  So what I did, was give my Civic to my Mother and she gave me the down payment for my Prelude.  Wow I was so excited!!!  It had all the new gidgets and gadgets and a sunroof, air conditioning a brand new concept in a car for me and real comfortable seats.  I was very happy.  

Well now it's the year 2000 and I still have my 1980 Honda Prelude and it still runs great.  Most reliable car I have ever had.  Always get the oil changed every 3000 miles, some minor things replaced, but overall nothing major to repair.  

So to anyone who is in the market to buy a new car, or used, I would definitely recommend a Honda of any kind.  They are so reliable and functionable and very easy to drive.  The gas mileage, fantastic.  Haven't found any other models that get this kind of gas mileage.  I believe in Honda's.   Enjoy the Ride!!!!!!!
