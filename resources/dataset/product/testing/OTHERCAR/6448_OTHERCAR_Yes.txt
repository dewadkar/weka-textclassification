            I didn't want to buy this car originally. When I started college, I was determined to buy a nice car, and the ubiquitous Camry was not what I had in mind. But my dad held fast that a used car must have a reputation for reliability, so he offered to buy a Camry for me. We set to looking for one, and finally found a V6 XLE with all the options, which, after test driving and thoroughly inspecting, I had been won over to. Then he pulls the bait and switch. It turns out he changed his mind about buying the car for me and if I wanted it, I would be paying for it myself. So I did. 

At first, I was not all that excited about the car. It does everything well; it is quiet, handles nicely, is comfortable and roomy enough for my 6'5" 210 lb self, and is very reliable. My first dilemma was that this car looks like every other car on the road. On my street, 3 other people had the exact same car, a '95 Toyota Camry V6 XLE, beige with tan interior, same alloy wheels. I quickly learned the license plate to avoid trying to open the wrong car in the parking lot. However, there are certain things that can be done to give you a sense of uniqueness in the car. A good place to start is the wheels. I went with a set of beautiful 17" Borbets. A spoiler can also be added to set it apart. The great thing is, you can sportify the car a little bit but keep that dependable Toyota build quality.

Which brings me to a few qualifiers. Everybody knows that Toyotas are reliable cars, usually requiring nothing more than scheduled maintenance. What nobody seems to mention is what scheduled maintenance actually entails. I bought my car with 66K miles on it. At around 70-75k miles, a few important things must be done. First of all, the timing and drive belts must be replaced. This is about $300. The spark plugs can go to 100k, they tell you, but it's worth noting that if you leave them in that long, you might not be able to get them out. So the spark plugs need to be replaced at around 75k miles as well. And, oh yes, in the V6, those are platinum tipped plugs. $100. Then the radiator flush. $80. The tranny fluid flush. $100. It starts adding up, considering all these things were done in my first 4 months of ownership. 

But it gets better. Toward the end of January '01, my right front brake caliper seized upon the rotor. The already worn brake pad quickly disappeared and a metal on metal grind quickly developed. By the time I got to the shop, bits of rotor and caliper had ground off each other in ashen form and cemented onto my beautiful polished aluminum wheel, leaving about 1 millimeter of black soot all over the wheel. I was able to clean most of it off, but only with a Brillo pad, which left infinite tiny scratches in the polished surface of the wheel.

 But it gets better still. The cost of one caliper is $120. But that wouldn't do, because it destroyed the rotor too. As it turns out, calipers and rotors must always be replaced in pairs, otherwise the mismatched brakes will work unevenly and pull the car to one side or the other. Long story short, $504.17. So grand total repair bills in the first 5 months came to about $1000. 

The rejoinder to this story is that one must expect to make repairs to any used car. People tend to sell their cars right about the time they will need these various repairs. So set aside a few bucks to do all this stuff right away, and, as I am currently hoping, you will be set for a while. 

Other minor gripes: dome light doesn't work, digital clock fades to black intermittently, speaker cover on driver door occasionally pops off.

And a few notes for those with V6 Camrys. Regular fuel is all that is required, but you can save money and improve performance and engine cleanliness and life by using premium! 92 octane is usually 15 cents more than 87 octane. However, using the higher grade has improved gas mileage in my car by 3 mpg in city driving. On 20 gallons of fuel, the premium will cost an extra $3, but you will get another 60 miles. 60 miles is worth 3 gallons of gas, which at $1.50/gal is $4.50. So on 20 gallons, you save $1.50 by using premium, plus the engine runs smoother and delivers more power when you want it. 

Also, I recommend K&N air filters in the Camry. They really do boost power, and give you a little edge over other Camrys on the road.
