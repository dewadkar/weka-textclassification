            We purchased Toyota Corolla because we were looking for a tiny car, so that my mom would have no problem driving it. We have the older version of Toyota '97,it's a smaller then the newer ones. There is not enough room in front and almost no space in the back. It's 4V, so it can not be overloaded. I personally don't like the appearance of Corolla because there is just nothing special about this model. It's a perfect automobile for those who are looking for a small, not expansive car. If you ask me about its internal durability, I will have to say that we haven't had a single serious problem in over two years. You have to decide if Toyota Corolla fits your personal needs. Don't rush, look around, and see if there is a better car offered for same price. <br><br>
