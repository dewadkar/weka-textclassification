               We bought a new De Ville in Sept of 99 and have never looked back.
Even though ours has the small V-8 we have plenty of power for freeway
use. The ride is very comfortable, gas mileage O.K. for a car of this
weight and our dealer service has been excellent.
   One option on the car I thought I'd never have much use for in the
Southern climate is the seat heating option. Both of us have had
occasion to use it and find ourselves enjoying the option. The seats
have lumbar support adjustments which I also find very useful on long
trips. 
   The phrase, &quot;Buy a Cadillac, you won't go back&quot; is very true. I can't
imagine buying a Mercedes or other luxury car again.<br><br>
