            I was looking for a cheap digital camera to add to my more expensive professional camera [Sony F707].  Essentially I wanted a "throw in the backpack, rough use, day-trip camera".

I read the reviews on several and compared the quality of various camera's, but this was the cheapest [35 bucks from Amazon used section]

I took it out on a weekend trip and used it extensively and these are my results:
1. Picture quality is OK for 800M
2. Flash is OK, but will overexpose pictures if used in a close up picture, Macro shots are fine.
3. Sharpness of pictures can be variable but on the whole is OK
4. Eats batteries, but basically lasts for 34 shots odd.

Advise:  First thing to do is pick up a 16M Smart Media card, it holds over 200 shots.  Second is go buy a cheap set of rechargeable batteries and a charger [Radio shack do them for around 15 bucks].  Thirdly, If you have other smart media devices [like an MP3 player], go get a smart media card reader, or even if you don't.. they are still good.  This last item makes pulling the pictures off the card really easy.  One thing I found though is that the 2M card supplied does cause some problems with a card reader, the 16M one did not at all.
