            <i>WOW.</i>  This is one cool LSUV (Luxury SUV).  The all-new 2001 QX4 is simply amazing.  No kidding.  I am NOT a truck guy (I am a sports-car and luxury-car guy), and this SUV truly impressed me with it's fantastic acceleration, awesome handling and luxury-car ride and comfort.

I am a published freelance automotive journalist, and I also sell Infiniti automobiles (to pay the bills --freelance journalists don't earn enough to buy birdseed).  One might logically assume that I would be biased, but ultimately I am a journalist at heart, and therefore my nature forces me to be objective in musings such as this one.  No kidding.  If I find a flaw in it's design, I'll mention it.

To continue...

The newly facelifted 2001 QX4 received much more than just a pretty new set of Xenon headlamps and memory seats.  First the visual factor:  The reworked front end is now much more stylistic and aggressive.  The theme of clean lines and a highly engineered appearance is obvious in the new grill which juts out from the front of the car.  The new headlamps are a work of art, and (yes) the low-beams are Xenon (blue-white).  The high-beams are probably the most interesting design I've ever seen in a headlamp:  the 5&quot; wide (blue-tinted) orbs about an inch and a half tall are mounted at the base of the headlamp cluster.  These obviously highly stylized orbs resemble chunks of a fine crystal and would not be out of place on an elegant coffee table.  The turn signals and foglamps have been integrated into single-lens units, cleaning up the lower corners of the front of the car.  The overall appearance is one of a QX4 that has grown up and been to the gym.

Out back, things are bolder than before and much classier.  The license place surround now integrates clear-lens back-up lights and the Infiniti logo.  The new look is much cleaner and classier overall.

New body-side-cladding replaces the old style with a more angular and stylish design.  The vehicle now looks more high-tech and futuristic thanks to this, and the new cladding also helps protect against parking lot dents and dings.

Inside, things definitely look different.  A redesigned dash and center console feel must more elegant than that found in the previous generation QX4.  The new electro-florecsent gauges are both visually stunning and very easy to read.  The new a/c and audio controls are great looking and a snap to use.  The trademark Infiniti analog clock finally found its way into the QX4, and the already excellent stereo has been retuned for even cleaner sound.

However, The real big news is under the hood, where a completely new engine awaits the command from a heavy right foot of the enthusiastic driver.  This all-new powerplant is based on the celebrated (named one of the &quot;Best Engines in the World&quot; by Ward's Auto World 6 years running) &quot;VQ&quot; engine used in the Infiniti I30.

Displacement is increased to 3.5L, up from 3.0L as found in the 2000 I30 and Maxima.  Horesepower is increased to 240 (from 170 in the previous 3.3L QX4 powerplant), and torque jumps 65 lb-ft to 265.  Not bad for a V6!  Nevermind... This is the most powerful V6 of <i>any</i> SUV, and it feels like it.  This thing is <i>FAST.</i>

This represents a major change for the QX4.  The previous generation was a capable SUV, to say the least (rated a &quot;best-buy&quot; by Popular Mechanics magazine), but the #1 complaint from owners was a lack of horsepower.  70 additional ponies should be enough to satisfy even the most demanding enthusiast.  It certainly put a big smile on my face the first time I drove it!  :-)

Instead of making excuses for the engine in the QX4, I suddenly find myself telling people to &quot;take it easy&quot; on test drives.  This new engine completely changes the character of the vehicle.  It has always handled well, but refinements to the suspension and a new wheel/tire combo (17&quot; wheels are now available) result in a truly car-like driving experience.  The spirited accelleration provided by the new 3.5L VQ engine makes the QX4 a genuinely exciting drive. --Imagine a luxurious sport sedan with an 85 cubic foot trunk and you're on the right track.

New standard features for 2001 include an in-dash 6-disc CD changer (with no magazine), height-adjustable HID (high intensity discharge) Xenon headlamps (the blue ones), very cool back-lit analog gauges, and the [Infiniti] signature analog clock now resides front and center in the center dash console.

If you are considering any of this vehicles competitors (Lexus RX300, Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, Toyota 4-Runner Limited, Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer, Mercedes-Benz ML, etc.), I urge you to take a test drive in the new QX4.  Drive the others first and then stop by your local Infiniti dealer.  You will be amazed at what you get for $34,150 (base price).  Not only will the 2001 QX4 out-accelerate any of the above, it will also out handle, out corner, and grandly out-style them all.

Unlike the Lexus RX300, it has room for ALL your stuff (and it doesn't remind you of a minivan inside).  Unlike the Mercedez-Benz ML SUVs, it handles like a sedan, and and it does not resemble a minivan from the rear.  Unlike the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, it is actually comfortable and a genuine delight to drive (the Jeep's steering, seating, ergonomics and excessive road noise leave a LOT to be desired).  Unlike the Toyota 40Runner Limited, this is not a truck --and it does not drive like one (the same goes for the Ford Explorer, Mercury Mountaineer, etc.).

What I love:  accelleration, handling, durability, quality, styling, comfort, cargo-space, versatility, valet-factor, award-winning service, best warranty in the luxury car industry

What I hate: people who think the Lexus RX300 is a better vehicle.  Come on --It's based on a CAMRY platform!  Ten years from now, we'll see which vehicle is still solid as a rock... :-)  Ok, so I'm taking pot-shots.  My apologies. :-P The Lexus isn't bad... It's just not serious competition to the QX4.  Nothing really is.  Take my word for it.  As the ad campaign proudly states... <i>&quot;Own one and you'll understand.&quot;</i>  No kidding.<br><br>
