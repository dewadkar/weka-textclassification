                 Three weeks ago, as I was speeding down a country road in my suburu sedan, I caught a white tail out of the corner of my eye and the impact through my car across the road, and down a bank. The buck didn't have a chance, and naturally, the joke became &quot;I was the only one in my family to get a deer this year&quot;.
       This time around I was determined to get something hardier with more weight behind it. Next time I hit a deer or moose, I want to win. After carefully reviewing all the 6 cylinder suv's available, I was impressed with the Jeep Cherokee price point. The Jeep lease incentives can not be beat right now.I test drove Rav 4, toyota 4 runner, ford explorer, Durango, as well as a Jeep Grand Cherokee. The bottom line is the bottom line. For the money, you can't do better. 
       The Jeep Cherokee is not filled with luxuries, but with basic cloth seats, easily reached controls, am/fm/cassette,and the sport package (larger wheels, roof rack and trim) it fits the bill.This summer, it will pull our pop-up and now, when it is 23 below zero in New Hampshire, it starts right up. Our other vehicle, a 1999 ford tauras, had to be towed to the dealer and the battery recharged this am.)
       Our three children are comfortable in the back seat and the cargo area holds quite a bit, as well as having the flexibility of folding the back seat down.
       I highly recommend this vehicle for those who want a sports utility vehicle for a car payment, not a mortgage payment!
