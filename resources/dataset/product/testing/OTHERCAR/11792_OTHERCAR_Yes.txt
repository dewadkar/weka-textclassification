            If Darwin were still with us he could have used the Volvo 960 as evidence of evolution.  Apparently the dinosaur and the 960 reached a point of evolutionary perfection and extinction was the next natural step.    

The origin of this species began in the early 80s and was named the 760, and its purpose was to serve as the flagship of all Volvos, sort of the S80 of the 80s.  Early on the 760 shared the same chassis and body with the 740 but had a more upscale interior. As the 760 evolved there were the additions of independent multi-link rear suspension, a distinctive headlight and grill package, a more feature packed dash and more complete instrumentation. 

Moving into the 90s the 960 began to evolve further with the introduction of the B6204 engine, which is a straight six that was designed to be lightweight, powerful, and efficient.  The basic engine design took the 960 all the way until its final year and is essentially the same basic design used in the 960�s replacement, the S80.  In the 960 the engine was driving the rear wheels through a tried and true Aisin-Warner four speed automatic transmission.  
     
In 1995 the final evolution began, the 960, sedan and wagon, benefited from the introduction of a new suspension, front and rear, and as never before the wagon had been fitted with an independent rear suspension.  For those of us who are rear wheel drive diehards this addition was long overdue and now Volvo offered a wagon that was fun to cruise the planet with.  

Additional upgrades were new exterior sheet metal, bumpers, plusher interior, improved sound systems, more soft touch appointments, standard anti-theft and remote keyless entry.  This is by no means a complete listing of the 95 960�s refinements but from a practical perspective all that really makes the car more evolved.  In 1996 the 960 had a fuel system management change that coincided with the OBDII federal compliance.

On the road the 960 will never win any awards for it�s manners in snow nor will it ever be confused with a BMW for its around town ride quality, but out on the open road is where the 960 really shines.  The in-line six delivers silky smooth power from a low 1800 rpm right on up into the 5000 rpm range, this flat power band allows this sedan to roll along comfortably in and out of town.  

If you are required to spend inordinate amounts of time behind the wheel the 960 makes a great road car.  The reliability has been good with only some minor trouble areas and most of those are trim/feature oriented. 

To postscript the above statement, no automobile manufacturer is perfect and each vehicle has its glitches so I am not saying, in this case that the car is without some items that should have been better engineered but in most instances, from a mechanical perspective, these items are remedied simply.  

The items in the mechanical department to watch, if you are considering purchasing one of these used are as follows:

1. Warped Brake Rotors, which is usually a result of improper wheel lug   torque.

2. Torn front control arm bushings, a normal wear item, but inexpensive to repair.

3. Clunking in the rear over bumps, which is attributed to rear shocks, another not too expensive replacement if they are not the self leveling type.  The dealer can decode the chassis stamp to determine the replacement shocks, but it is usually the inexpensive shocks that are known to be noisy.

4. Secondary Air Pump system is prone to failure due to a leaking �pair valve�.  The valve can stay open allowing too much exhaust with unburned emissions into the air pump and ruin the air pump motor.  The secondary air system is easily tested by a dealer, with a component selection feature of the Volvo Scan Tool, (VST).  

To summarize the Volvo 960, also S/V90 as of mid 1997, the last year of production 1998, is a workhorse that reflects the remains of the character that once made Volvo synonymous with durability, function, and safety.  In Volvo circles none of the owners that I have know ever expected perfection but rather a pension to roll despite the sometime irksome irregularities,  almost human in a way.
