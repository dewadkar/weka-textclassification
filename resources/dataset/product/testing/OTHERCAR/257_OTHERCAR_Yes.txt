            I did extensive research prior to purchasing this camera so I knew what to expect when I got it.  This camera has a battery life second to none.  I don't know how many pictures it takes to discharge the battery but so far I have taken at least 300 superfine resolution pictures using the IBM 512 or 340 drives without needing to re-charge the battery. 

Battery life is important in Digital Cameras as some can use a set of 4 AA batteries in 25 to 40 pictures even at low resolution.   I have had a camera like this and I spent more time switch out my huge supply of very expensive AA batteries then I did taking pictures.

Storage is super-important in Digital Cameras.  Why pay upwards of $1000.00 for a 500 meg memory card of any type when you can pay $350.00 for a IBM Micro-drive at 512 MEG and it comes with a Camera Mate USB reader that makes it SCREAM!  

If you can't find the IBM drive and Camera Mate combo at a good price, contact me at epinions@mydamndomain.com

Being that battery life and storage were the shortcomings of other digital cameras I have owned in the past, there were the most important issues in this purchase and the Cannon G1 not only met these concerns, it completely satisfied them and then some.  I can take pictures all day long with one charge and one drive.  

It is somewhat hard to use and adjust the camera if you have large hands.  It's not as comfortable to hold as many other cameras on the market either.  The viewfinder is hard and uncomfortable to use also.  

Even though I am a reseller and can get this item for less, I purchased it at Circuit City so that I could also pick up an extended warranty.  I didn't want a $900 camera that might not make it through the warranty.  This plus if it ever totally dies and has to be replaced, I get the 899 to spend on whatever is available at the time.  Surely 899 will buy a even better camera in 3 years then it does NOW!  
The 4-year warranty was about 100 to 150 and well worth the extra funds.
