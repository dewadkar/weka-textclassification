            The Boxster S is not only a powerful car, but it is beautiful.  The Boxster looks somewhat similar to the 550 Spyder.  The car's looks seem to have awakened a desire to have a small, new, road-going 2-seater among enthusiasts who are normally restoring vintage cars.  The Boxster makes you think &quot;Mabey I should sell all of my old cars and buy one of these.&quot;  The Boxster is simply a handsome car that picks up flamboyantly on its own family heritage, but without looking cartoonish.

When sports cars become too heavy, it's easy to forget why we buy them in the first place.  Although the 3020-lb. Boxster could loose a few pounds (a lighter Speedster version would be nice), it still has the small, agile, sports car feel.  The Boxster S has a 3.2-liter water-cooled flat-6 that puts out 250 bhp at 6250 rpm and 225 lb.-ft. of torque at 4500 rpm.  The Boxster S's big discs stop the Boxster with race-car alacrity, and the suspension and steering are superbly communicative.  The car is supple and comfortable on the road, but is as much fun to drive in the open as a pure sports-racer.

The Boxster S is a race car for the road that's easy to live with, good-looking and fun.  The Boxster S is everything that a sports car should be. <br><br>
