            I have owned my wonderful Patriot Blue PT Cruiser since late August and I have never been happier with a automobile. It has been well worth the 19,500 dollars that was paid for it and I only had to wait four months, not that I was in a hurry anyway, as long as it was here before October. My car was built for me and includes things such as a moon roof, cd player, it is an automatic, keyless entry, and power everything.

A lot of people wonder what made me choose this car and it was pretty simple, I was pregnant with my first child. OK, maybe it wasn't that simple but here is the situation, I owned a small sports car and my husband owned a Geo Tracker, neither of these being &quot;family&quot; cars. I decided that we had to have at least one car that we would all fit in. So the search began.

The following reasons are why I ended up with the PT Cruiser: #1 was brand loyalty. I have always owned Chrysler vehicles and have had very little problems with any of them. #2 Price, there are not very many vehicles out there that you can buy with lots of goodies inside for under 20,000 dollars. #3 The amount of room inside, we needed to fit two adults, one baby seat, and two dogs, not to mention all the other stuff that comes along with them. The seat fold every which way and we have even had four adults and a baby seat in it at the same time. My father has sat in the back seat and he is 6 feet tall 250 pounds and he was comfortable. On the other hand my 6'4'' brother does not fit. These are the things I love about my car.

To be honest I must add the things that do annoy me and to some people this would change there mind about this cool car. One of the big things is it has a lot of blind spots and the side mirrors are small so they do not help a lot. I have gotten use to it but it isn't always fun. The gas mileage on mine is 22 miles per gallon and with the rise in gas prices it hurts (my last car was 33 miles per gallon). The only other thing that use to annoy me was the power window adjusters are not on the door they are in the middle of the dash, now it just doesn't matter.

I really do love my car and the way it zooms (largest engine I have ever driven) down the road with everyone watching as I go. I hope that everyone gets a chance to find a car that fits them as well as my PT Cruiser fits me.<br><br>
