            We had a Cherokee Sport that we bought just prior to my wife having our daughter.  Soon it became apparent that we would have to change our vehicle situation.  We settled on a '99 Caravan Sport and have been extremely happy with it since.  We love the convenience of the driver side sliding door, don't get one without it.  Our van is a sport, short wheelbase model with the six cylinder.  It could use a little more power, but the engine is adequate.  We have the middle row bucket seats which makes a versatile van much more so.  You can drive with the front seats in only, with one middle row bucket seat in, with both bucket seats in, with the rear bench removed, with the rear bench moved up into the middle row, and several other configurations.  I would strongly suggest tinted windows for the vehicle because of all the glass area can heat up the interior real quick.  The only gripe I have with the vehicle is the autolocking feature whereupon the doors will lock automatically anytime you travel faster than 20mph.  However, after living with the annoyance for a while, I found that the feature can be disabled.
