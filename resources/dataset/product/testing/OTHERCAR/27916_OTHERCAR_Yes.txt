            In August of last year, I purchased my second Lexus LS400-a 1998 model.  It replaced a 1992 that had more than 120,000 miles.
I had not intended to get another Lexus because of their high price and price of maintenance and common parts (i.e. spark plugs, wipers, etc.) but the car was such a joy to drive that I relented.  I'm not sorry.  The car is wonderful.  I looked at many luxury cars but the Lexus is the most user-friendly.  Everything is simple to operate (unlike the features on some luxury cars) and more than adequate for the type of driving I do.
What really sold me, though, was the dependability of my previous Lexus. Although repairs and parts are very high-almost exhorbitant-nothing much had to be done to the automobile.  I needed brakes at 100,000 miles, had the serpentine belt replaced at 90,000 miles, and replaced the battery at about 80,000 miles.  That was it except for the scheduled maintenance which costs about double for what my other car costs. I just consider that the price of owning and driving such an excellent automobile.
Dealer support is outstanding.  <br><br>
