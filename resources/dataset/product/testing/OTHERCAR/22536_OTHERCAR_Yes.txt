            I have been blessed, as previously mentioned in an earlier review, to have owned two Monte Carlo Z34's in the past few years.

I had trouble with the 1996 Monte Carlo, filed a Lemon Law Case on it, and was at first, forced into purchasing another Chevy.  

Well, loving the vehicle as much as I did, I gave the Monte Carlo Z34 another chance, hoping beyond all hope, that this would not be a lemon vehicle too.

I am coming back to put out a follow up report, as I have had the 1998 Monte Carlo Z34 for 2 years now.  I have to honestly say that I have been impressed with this vehicle.  I didn't want to give it a fair chance having been burned before, and I watch everything very closely expecting problems.

None have surfaced.  I have to say this vehicle has lived up to my previous expectations, reliable, fun driving, comfortable, sporty, and just plan exciting.  TAZ, the mascot for the Monte Carlo represents the wild side that I do feel cruising in my car, especially in the summer with the sun roof open, windows open, and the wind racing through my hair.

If I had to suggest a vehicle to people looking to spend around $18,000 to $22,000 on a vehicle, for the space, room, comfort, and style and handling of a car, the Monte Carlo is an EXCELLENT choice.  Hands down.

Believe, I have been through the worst car buying experience in my life, and I can say that this experience has made me on tough sale, but the Monte Carlo is worth it.

Thank you.<br><br>
