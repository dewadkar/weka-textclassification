            In early November I leased a new 2000 Olds Alero Coupe, this car has a Shiny black finish, with a very classy interior with all the controls placed perfectly in the drivers reach. The Olds Alero is the finest quality from day one. No defects in this car. My Alero is a very loaded model, nice features for a sub compact. This car replaced an intermediate size coupe, and I don't miss it. The V6 is very peppy and the power steering is perfect. The sound system (CD/Cassette 6 speaker)is excellent. The performance Goodyear Tires are very sticky (Sport handling package)especially on wet pavement, add in the ABS and Traction control and you have a very safe package. The fit finish of this car is excellent. The Alero is a world class car in all areas. ADDED 1/13/00= Living in Michigan I have now had the chance to drive my Alero on snow and ice. Its ability to grip the road in winter conditions is fantastic. This car is the complete package, rain, dry, snow or ice it still performs. In the two months I have owned it, even if I nit picked I still would not be able to find anything wrong or out of place with this car.<br><br>
