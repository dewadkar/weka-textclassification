            Where to start, where to start...   Let's see, I "inherited" my 1990 Mazda 626 from my mom, who bought it new, so I guess you could say that I've been there throughout the entire life of the car.  And I must say it's doing pretty dang good for being 14 years old and 150,000 miles.  I've had it for three years, its been my only car, and I completely recommend it for any new driver.

Exterior:
For being a car that was made during the era of "boxes with wheels" this car is very streamlined. It's got very clean, smooth lines.  I've had a few problems with the fuse in the windshield wipers.  Sometimes when I go to turn them on, they dont work.  The side mirrors have that cool feature where if you get too close to something and hit it with your mirrors, they fold in.

Interior:
All of the panels and buttons are easy to read.  I love that this car has a tachometer even though its and automatic.  It also has a tripometer (very handy)  Even though the body doesnt look that big, its very roomy inside.  I have moved/taken road trips all over the country in this car and it has plenty of legroom in the front and the leg room in the back is just mediocre.  TONS of trunk space!  My family of four's suitcases all fit back there.  Both the AC and heater take a little longer than I'd like to kick in but once they kick, look out!  Those are some powerful blasts of hot/cold air.  The cloth seats in the front are pretty comfortable for rides around town but when it comes to road trips, they start to hurt my back.  The seats in the back are very comfortable (I cant tell you how many times I fell asleep back there as a kid) and the headrests on the front seats are adjustable.

Under the hood:
The four-cylinder engine is kinda wimpy.  This car does NOT like hills.  But with all of the crap this car has been through, the only thing I've had to replace in the last three years is a fan belt and the distributor.
