              I took delivery on my Chevrolet Tahoe back in February and since I have only driven it about 4200 miles.  We are about to take a long summer road trip, and I am very much looking forward to seeing how my truck holds up.  Since I took delivery I have done mostly in town driving with A LOT of time spent sitting in traffic.  My truck has held up great, and despite the brutal effects that bumper to bumper traffic can have on a car, mine has done great.  

  I opted for the LT trim package with every available option.  Sound system with CD, power sunroof, trailer package, rear seat audio controls, 3rd row seating, and the heated seats.  We also opted for the brand new 5.3L 285hp VORTEC engine, and it has put to shame some of my other buddies SUV's.  We also had the dealer install a custom billet grille and painted the rear vents to match the color of the truck.  After all that my truck topped out at just under a hefty $42,000 ($41,814 to be exact).  

DRIVING IMPRESSIONS:  From the driver seat of my truck I've got a commanding view of the road, which is great.  My drivers seat is extremely comfortable, and makes me feel like a king.  All the audio and HVAC controls are angled toward the driver, which makes them in easy reach while driving.  When moving along the truck feels very stable and turns on a dime.  While I have noticed that my transmission is a little rough on some low-end shifts, its nothing major.  When cruising along at 65-70mph, the truck feels firmly attached to the road and is still easy to control.  The brakes are worlds away from other Chevy SUV's I've driven, and they seem very unlikely to fade through rough driving.  My gas mileage has not been all that impressive, but I am averaging  15mpg in in city, which is what my window sticker said.  It is very nice to know that if gas prices do get out of hand my truck will still run on 87 octane. (I put 89 or 93 in it now)

VISUAL IMPRESSIONS: The now 2 year old facelift for all of Chevy's full-size trucks and SUV's was subtle, but was enough to make the trucks look more aggressive. When you see one coming down the street, you can still tell its a Chevy, but a whole new Chevy.  The billet grille and painted rear vents look awesome, and I recommend them to anyone who wants to add a more aggressive look to their truck. The new 8-speaker sound system with subwoofer is great compared to other standard stereo systems from Ford and Dodge. I also enjoy having a CD player on the Dash, instead of in the glove box like my last car. I can turn the Bass up and blow away any factory system. The interior is a little plain but very functional with plenty of storage space for anything and everything.  There are also enough cup holders throughout the truck for everyone. I have noticed some minor interior defects, but none have lead my back to my dealer.  I had one of the screws in the inside roof fall out, my roof isn't falling down, but now I've got a minor hole in my roof. (it doesn't leak, just doesn't look good)  Also I have noticed a few spots where the interior did not mold well with the edges, but those haven't bothered me.  

OVERALL:  With all that said, I know that my truck is going to last me well past 100,000 miles, and I plan to drive it for that long.  And, as long as my truck continues to please me, I'll continue to recommend Chevrolet products.
