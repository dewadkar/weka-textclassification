            Hopefully the subject line grabbed your attention.  I am a basic camera happy person and in the past, I haven't really spent that much money on film-based cameras and was really never happy with the quality.  I decided to wonder into the digital camera market and now I'm so glad that I did.  I researched a camera (within this price range) and found the Canon S10 powershot.  My life has never been the same.  This camera is wonderful!!!  This will be your last camera that you will purchase.  The quality is great!  What a powerful little camera.  I chose the S10 because of the features, zoom and pixel images.  You can choose black and white, panoramic pictures, zoom in, etc.  I even have printed copies of digital pictuers on regular photo paper (through a photo finishing company) and you can't tell the difference.  I am in love with my S10 and take it everywhere I go.  I'm so happy to have made this purchase.  The S10 also comes with a rechargable battery (thank god, because these suckers are little piggies).  I did upgrade to a 48mb compact flash card, because of my picture taking habits.  Even the software that Canon provides is so easy to use, you just plug it in and it loads up.  Finally, a company designed a product that is easy and a joy to use.  Needless to say, the camera is a hit with everyone and a crowd pleaser.  Thank you Canon!

I recommend this camera for those who don't know too much about digital cameras but want a top of the line within a reasonable price range.  

This camera also has made me look great at work, since I'm in real estate and taking pictures often at various sites.  I just snap and forward pictures to collegues very easily.<br><br>
