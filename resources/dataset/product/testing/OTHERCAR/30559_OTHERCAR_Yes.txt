            Unlike the Passport (Isuzu Rodeo sibling), the Honda Passport is all HONDA. 

General Appearance.

1. It looks boxy in certain angles but show some hint of aerodynamic styling.
2. The wheels seems rather small for its size. It should have at least 17" rims.
3. The front headlights looks great, especially the black trim in the front bumper. It really adds character to this SUV.
4. The interior leather is top notch in quality. It feels smooth and if you compare it to other leather seats, this one is soft but not thin. It feels similar to the Coach leather seats offered by Lexus.


Performance
1. 240 hp is very nice
2. Decent fuel economy
3. What sets this apart from many other SUV in its class is that passing a vehicle DOES NOT REQUIRE ADVANCE PLANNING. It has plenty of power to pass vehicles, even on single lane roads since it can accelerate quickly with the punch of the gas. 
4. Driving the Pilot feels like driving a V6 Accord. It is very car like, it handles and responds very well with only a slight hint of body roll.
5. Engine noise is subtle though you can hear it grown if you gas it. It is actually a nice noise to hear the muscular 240hp V6 deliver power to the wheels.
6 VTEC. Did I say VTEC? Honda VTEC engines are probably the world best. Toyota came up with the VVTI, and Mitsubishi's MIVEC, but if you read on many journals, and articles, Honda VTEC is often imitated but never duplicated. It gives both power and fuel economy, and with its patented oil cooling technology, expect these engines to last virtually forever.

Value
1. Excellent value. It costs less than the MDX even though their performance features are similar. 
2. This vehicle is perfect for families with small children, with more than two adults in the house and looking for other alternatives for a minivan.

Other Comments.

The pilot gives the flexibility of hauling a family plus related gear (car seats, stroller etc.) and still have plenty of space groceries,etc. Even though rather tight spaced, the third seat gives room to bring friends and family along. 

The PILOT is also a ULEV, important for those who care about the environment. 

This vehicle is very worthy replacement of the Passport. There are some replacement vehicles that don't make much sense. For example, replacing the ageless Acura Integra with a the Acura RSX did not make sense to many enthusiast including myself. However, Honda's decision to finally get rid of the Passport and introduce the Pilot is one of the best thing the company has done in recent years.
