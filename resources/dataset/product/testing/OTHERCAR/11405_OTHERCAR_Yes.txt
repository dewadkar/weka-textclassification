            This is by far the best Sports Utility Vehicle in its class.  I recently bought a 2000 Toyota 4Runner Limited.  After numerous test drives of other trucks such as Land Rover's Discovery, Nissan's Pathfinder, Ford Explorer, and the Jeep Grand Cherokee, I conclude that the 4Runner is much better in every aspect.  It is the smoothest ride, it handles better than any car I have ever seen, and it has the acceleration of a sports car.  Further more, its price is equal or better than those of the other main SUVs.  To put it plainly, this is the single greatest car I have ever driven.  The only fault it has is that it can only get about 300 miles per tank of gas, which is still better than the other SUVs.  If youre in the market to buy a truck, this is the one to choose. <br><br>
