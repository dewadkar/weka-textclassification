            We purchased the Plymouth Grand Voyager as a dealer demo model with 6000 miles on it.  Except for a few stains in the carpet, the van looked fairly new.  When we test drove the van, we heard a squeaking noise coming from one of the sliding side doors.  We had the noise fixed and signed the papers that day.  

After 2 years of trouble free operation, the Voyager developed a small oil leak in the valve cover gasket.  Not a major problem, but still inconvenient.  The major problem hit at about 56,000 miles.  The transmission decided to give out one morning, without warning.  Of course, this happened on a Saturday, when the Chrysler dealer's shop was closed.  Four days and $1800 later we had our van back.  Even though the van was out of the warranty period, I assumed the transmission would last longer than 56,000 miles.  I did some research and found that the Grand Voyager had a history of transmission problems.  This prompted me to call Chrysler customer service and ask if there had been any recalls I had missed.  Before I could get my question out they said they would pay for the parts ($1300), even it was 20,000 miles out of warranty.

Even though Chrysler reimbursed us for the parts, I learned some valuable lessons from this situation.
 
1)  When buying a new vehicle, do as much research as possible.
2)  Keep up to date on all recalls.
3)  Don't just buy the most popular vehicle around.
