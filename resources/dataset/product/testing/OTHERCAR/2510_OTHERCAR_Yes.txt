            i bought this vehicle back in 1991, and it has truly been a rock, solid performer.  i try to do most of the repairs myself.  during the first 8 years and 140,000 miles, i only experienced one minor repair.  the radiator needed to be replaced.  it however was so easy to do myself.  that is how it was, change oil, spark plugs, replace alternator, a couple batteries and one starter, replace brake pads and wa la....eight years of almost free, totally reliable service.  it is so hard to believe that it went so fast.

she has been so easy to work on.  one thing though is the engine compartment area, though adequate, is tight.  toyota built some of the areas for small hands.  however, many engineering designs allow for access or a quick fix.  i am totally impressed with its design.

even the EFI helps to sharp-shoot problems.  please get yourself a toyota service manual, it will help some.  a chilton manual or haynes will round out any issues or problems you might need to look up.

by the way, my truck is a 22RE, 4 cylinder engine, no power steering, regular cab, white, AC, 5 speed manual transmission.  i highly recommend this vehicle because of its superior engineer design.  the engine and body are very easy to repair.

i do wish i had got an extended cab for space.  recently, the head gasket went (144,00) and i decided to get a rebuilt engine.  if it does as well as this last engine, i will be very glad indeed.

as a last thing, i am now for the first time having to figure out why the engine is idling a little rough.  can you believe it, this is the first time i have ever had to deal with this?  after 149,000 miles, i am having to work on some idle problem.  by the way, the fuel filter appears to be a very difficult location.  gosh, this little truck has been good.<br><br>
