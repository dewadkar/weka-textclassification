            I did a great deal of research before buying a mid-range digital camera, and the D-340R is the one I chose.  After several months with the camera, I could not be happier.

The pictures are simply stunning in their quality, considering the price of the camera.  The camera has all the features I required: an integrated flash, both a viewfinder and an integrated display, and resolution over a megapixel.

There are almost no drawbacks to this camera.  The only noteworthy problem I can think of is that it tends to bleed the batteries fairly quickly when the viewscreen is on.  Still, the battery life is certainly sufficient for shooting several &quot;rolls&quot; of shots, as long as you don't spend a lot of time admiring your work on the screen.  I remedied this trouble by buying an inexpensive battery charger and a set of Ni-MH batteries, which have worked out very well.

The manual is difficult to use, but with an hour or so of practice, one can easily master the more advanced features.

Overall, a super camera for the price!<br><br>
