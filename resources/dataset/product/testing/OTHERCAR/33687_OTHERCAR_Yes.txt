            This car is not made of Gold, but it is a goldmine for stable, reliable transportation. We bought our Regal about 6 years ago... brand new... and right off the showroom floor with no money down etc... signed the paperwork and drove out of the showroom etc. 

We had first driven a Regal while on Vacation in Orlando. Renting a car that you are interested in is a smart move..we just did not at the time know we were interested in that car, or any other car for that matter. 

The car runs very smoothly, the controls are all within easy reach... just wish they would move some of them so that if the steering wheel is tilted up that you don't have to move your head to sight the gauge. It is not at all annoying though because the one in question is the trip odometer.. now how often really do you have to look at the trip odometer??? 

The steering wheel has a nice feel, the car turns over nicely. the motor is not as loud as my previous Buick. 

The car interiors are nice, seats are comfortable. The cup holder has broken twice... I like large drinks, what can I say... and I refuse to pay for another one.. as they are pricey. 

I have broken off the radio antenna twice through carelessness and again, I refuse to replace it. The sound on my radio and tape player is still wonderful...so why should I replace the antenna...(No I am not one of those picky audiophiles)        

Love the overhead reading lights in the front seat and the little ones in the rear seating as well. Many at trip, I have used them to read while my chauffeur husband drove... 

Then there is the wonderful, life-saver of dual temperature controls. My husband is a warm blooded male...aren't they all...and I am a cold blooded female...always cold... so dual temperature controls are a definite plus for our marriage... we do not fight over the temperatures in the car. We simply adjust it to suit us. 

Also there is a nice little feature that I really do love and consider to be an essential item when buying a new car...automatic door locks once the car is started.. is a wonderful safety feature...makes me feel secure that no one can get into the car once I have it on. and vice versa that no one can get out of it either...meaning kids. 

The trunk is wonderful. Has lots of room for me to put groceries in. Love the net to hold the groceries in so that they do not spill all over the car. The downside of the trunk is that if you have something in the far rear of the trunk you almost have to climb into the trunk to retrieve it. (do not do this on a lonely road in the middle of the night) 

All in all this is a great car... we have had to do no major repairs on it. Have about 77,000 miles and still rolling along. Hoping to go another 75,000

Update April 17, 2003
I still own this car. It now has over 112,000 miles on it and still going strong. It is a great car and has not given me any trouble. Must be faithful to maintenance schedules.. get oil changed, tires rotated, yada, yada, yada.. but it is worth it. I have no complaints.
