<b>Why did I buy the RCA Digital Camera MODEL CDS4100?</b>

I was looking for a higher resolution then the 640 x 480 digital camera that I owned.  I use my digital camera more than my 35 mm camera and also have prints made through Ofoto.com.  So I was wanting something that made better quality prints from the digital camera.

<b>Print Quality</b>

These prints look almost as perfect as the regular 35mm camera.  I was highly impressed with the clear crisp prints that I received from the digital images I uploaded.

<b>More detail about the camera</b>

The camera comes equipped with a 8 mb compact flash card.  On the fine quality it will hold 20 prints.  You can EASILY purchase another memory card to take more pictures when you are away from home.

The camera offers you 3 image resolution settings.  
<i>* Fine (no compression 1360 X 1024)
*Standard (medium compression 1360 X 1024)
*Low (fully compressed 640 x 480 resolution)

When using the standard and fine settings you will be able to hold more photos on the memory card, however the quality won't be as good.

The camera also features a date setting that will NOT print on the picture it self but will be stored with the picture so you can use it to reference back to if you need to remember the date or time the picture was taken.

The camera is hooked up to a serial port on your computer, which is a little slower to transfer the photos to P.C. or Mac but for very little money you can buy a USB device that you put the compact flash card into and it reads them from it rather than your camera itself.

You can also hook the camera up to your T.V. for viewing or recording onto vcr tape.

The camera is very compatiable and easy to hook up and get started with.  One feature I love about the software (driver) is that you can have it auto name and save your photos for you when transferring.  For example you put in 3 identifying letters and tell it what number to begin with and it will name them for you.  I.E. boa_001.jpg  etc....

That is very time saving and efficient.

I feel like the batteries have lasted a good amount of time.  When the standard batteries to run out I am going to use rechargeable.

It comes equipped with the power supply so you can easily run it from the power when transferring photos or are at home.

The camera has taken excellent pictures in all types of settings and lighting.

I think this camera is a great bargin for the money and features that it offers.  

I am highly satisfied with my purchase
