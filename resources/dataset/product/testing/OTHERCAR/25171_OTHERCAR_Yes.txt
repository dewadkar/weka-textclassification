            i bought this vehicle 2 months ago after looking at several other cars and test driving many.  Those cars were the toyota echo, mercury cougar, toyota echo, ford focus, honda accord, pontiac gran prix, buick regal and volkswagon jetta's and bugs.   The car has been a joy to ride and the ride is firm and the seats are supportive.  The climate controls are easy to read, understand and use as are the power windows and locks.  i bought the es version with the 1.8 engine and it is peppier than the ls version which my roommate has.  I have been getting 26-30 mpg and it has a dummy light when you need more gas.  the moonroof is functional and fun and the interior is laid out extremely well.  The 2000 model added chrome features to the doorknobs and the steering wheel, making it appear to be a more expensive car.  The silver paint seems durable and I have been told the car looks like a jetta.  For the money I could not have found a car with the accessories or looks for the same price.<br><br>
