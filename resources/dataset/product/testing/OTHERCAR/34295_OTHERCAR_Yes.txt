            <b>One car</b>

I started car hunting two years ago, when I needed a customer friendly transportation for my job - sales consulting.  The urge was very obvious each time I dropped/picked up my customer in/out from visitor parking, which are mostly right next to reserved slots for horses of dotcomer CEOs. (Hate to mention that I was driving an 89 Camry wagon, a car I loved but...)

A few months later, one car caught my attention.  It was Lexus Soarer, which was introduced into US market in 92(as SC line), after being very popular overseas(Strange Toyota always does that, Altezza is another example), though the US version was stripped of many advanced features, like active suspension, GPS, backup cam, turbo....

My wife gave me the final push, as it was the only non-ugly automobile in her mind (to some extent, I do agree) - The Soarer's unique sculpture-like body engineering process seemed to pay off well here:)

<b>My car</b>

The one I finally purchased was an SC400 92 US model, with 99K miles.  After putting 25K miles on it in 500 days, I would say the experience has been fantastic.

One thing can never be over-emphasized, is that it's NOT a sports car, even though millions of reviewers called it one, and its name even suggests Sport Couple.  But IMHO it's more a luxurious car:

1. Similarity with LS400.  You'd be shocked to find how much they share - Same engine, (almost) same interior...and most convincingly, 0-60 numbers in the same park.

2. Ride quality.  Admittedly SC was tuned more to the sports side - suspension is firmer, and exhaust is more aggressive.  But driving one has never given me any hint of a sports ride.  Turn on the CD player, set a comfortable volume, start the engine and get on a highway...Once you get out of it, you would hardly recall missing any note from the music, even though the engine has redlined a couple of times, and you might have got a speeding ticket on the way. Comparing with rides of BMW M3 or 911, no one could miss the difference.

3. 4-speed auto tranny, which alone is more than enough to kill any idea of sporty performance. Many expressed frustration after being smoked by cars half of the price, this might be the root cause.

Others have said enough about the quality, reliability, performance, service...So I just want to share something I feel the most - Ergonomics.

Limited by my financial status, I do not have access to all luxurious cars.  However, comparing MB, Bimmer, Infi..Lexus shines on ergonomics.  As a first time owner I never needed to read the manual.  All the features are self-explanatory, and human involvement has been reduced, IMHO, to a minimum.  The car has by far the fewest buttons, yet it gets all the jobs done - A/C is controlled, mostly, by one knob, the stereo, with CD, tape, and AM/FM, can be run by no more than 5...Plus, all the controls are logically placed within easy reach.  I was shocked testdriving the new BMW 745i, and wonder if ergonomics was patented by Lexus.

On the down side, Lexus DOES break, particularly at this age.  Due to Toyota's "equal-life" design on parts, 10yr/100K mile is a known troublesome stage.  My car got a broken window regulator, leaking PS pump, dead alternator, cracking coolant bottle, skipping CD changer, all within 9 months of each other.  According to the dealer and various user groups, these are all common problems.  I planned ahead $3K for the hits and barely made it.

My suggestion to potential buyers: Either wait a year or two until all the problems have hit, or spare a few grand for repairs (Even if you hire a mechanic like I did, you can never predict when they strike, b/c normally nobody can look inside the parts.), and plan to own it longer.  For a list of common problems, I suggest that you check SC400 user groups from Yahoo. 

<b>The car</b>

In summary, 

PROS

1. Beautiful body.  Notice the word is not "stylish", "sharp", or "attractive".  The car looks pretty from nearly every angle, but it never turns heads.  This is partially due to its popularity - everyone has one, and the body didn't change much from year to year (until 01)

2. Solid engineering. Judging from technologies 10 years ago, the car must have been a master piece.  From hydraulic cooling fan to active suspension (sorry not with US model), everything fits its pursuit on reliable luxury.  From that end, it has hit the bull's eye - Most Bimmers can beat a Soarer easily on tracks, but few can please people with German version of ergonomics.

3. Low cost of ownership.  Looking through the service history (available for every dealer serviced Lexus), I have to say I am the super unfortunate one, who paid more than half of all the bills.  But considering the 10-year span, and its high resale value, I can't say the car is expensive to run.  I wonder why so many look no further than the sticker before concluding SC400 is an expensive car.

4. Solid power train.  It might be questionable if Toyotas break less than others.  But I am a full believer that Toyotas have bulletproof power trains - Everything can break, but normally the car is still drivable.  Among all the troubles I had with my SC, the scariest one happened on my way back from a Thanksgiving party last year - The charging warning lit up.  But I managed to get home 37 miles away with highlights off, and was able to start it the next day and drove to the dealer.

GRIPES
1. No manual tranny.  The 4-speed auto not only kills performance (sluggish 1st gear and so-so 2nd), it's low final gear ratio (3K rpm at 80mph with overdrive on) also eats into gas mileage.  A 6-speed stick would have helped in both ends.

2. Lack of character.  It just happened that the car fits my like.  But most people, I feel, would like it either more sporty, with firmer suspension, louder tail pipes, sharper lines, twin turbos, and, a STICK, or just make it more luxurious by carrying over all features from  original Soarer - Active suspension, touch screen GPS, backup cam...
