            ~ ~ The Mercedes S600L sets the standard that other manufacturers in the luxury car bracket must now try to emulate.
It competes directly against the other German flagship, the BMW 750iL, and also against the Audi A8 4.2 quattro.

~ ~ So is it the world�s finest executive saloon? 
Certainly Mercedes would claim that it is, at least until they get round to releasing their new super car, the �Maybach�, that they promise will put every other car in this bracket into the shade.
But, at least for the moment, this Mercedes can probably lay claim to the title of the �top car for top people�.

~ ~ This is a big, heavy car, but driving it you would never catch on to that fact.
Its long wheelbase and huge 5,786cc V12 engine make very light work of shifting this car and its occupants about the place. 
The engine reaches its maximum power of 367bhp at 5,500rpm, and this power combined with a slick and extremely efficient five-speed automatic gearbox means that the driver never has to work too hard. It simply gets on with the job in hand without the slightest complaint, and works in perfect harmony with the driver to produce an effortless ride.
It has what Mercedes call an �intelligent� air suspension system that enhances the smooth and supple ride, but which can adapt to provide the driver with highly responsive handling and taut body control as the situation dictates.
As you would expect in a car with this sort of potent power, there is also a very powerful set of brakes, that slow progress with a quiet reassurance and confidence when required to do so.

~ ~ Climb inside the cabin and you realise straight away why Mercedes is the choice of so many top executives.
It has all the usual extras that you would expect, such as climate control, pre tensioned seatbelts, etc. But it�s when you get into the back seat, which is where owners of this car will spend most of their time, that the car really begins to shine.
This is unashamed luxury of the very highest level. There is nothing to garish or ostentatious, but rather an understated sense of class, with its pale grey and black plastics combining elegantly with touches of real walnut.
One of the most impressive things is the amount of space available; no banging your knees of the front seats in this wagon!!
The seats themselves are simply the best available, being crafted in a soft and supple �Nappa� leather. They are electrically adjustable to suit any size or shape of passenger, and can be either heated or cooled depending on the climatic conditions.
There is also a range of optional extras to make the top executive feel as though they�ve never actually left their office. You can have a walnut working table set into the back of the passenger seat, and even have a small fridge installed into the armrest to ensure that your chilled cocktails are always available on demand.

~ ~ In the UK the S600L starts at a base price of �77,040, that can rise steeply the more extras you decide to add. But compare this price to a Rolls Royce Silver Seraph at �159,000, and the Mercedes almost starts to look like a bargain!
(American readers check prices at your local dealer)

~ ~ If what you require is refined and spacious luxury transport to whisk you across Continents, or even simply to carry you from boardroom to boardroom in the city, then you will be hard put to find anything to beat this piece of German engineering genius.
