            We bought a 1998 Chevy S10, 4 cylinder extra cab. In general, I am extremely disappointed in the truck. Gets ok gas mileage, maybe 23 in the city and 26 highway. It is gutless on take off. We obviously have only owned the truck for 2 years and, at 30K miles, have already had the transmission fully redone! My father owns the same truck, a '98 single cab, and he too at 40K miles has had the transmission REPLACED! His was not on warranty anymore, refused to pay the $1600 to fix it because a transmission should last more than 40,000 miles! The dealer did replace it free of charge. Our transmission is still not functioning right, and will need to be worked on again. If I would have known then what I know now, I would have looked into the V-6 of this same truck.

What do I like about it? It has very comfortable seats, it's roomy, and I really like the looks of it. Ours is dark blue with grey interior and has the rubber and chrome siding. I can't help but like it because it's fun to drive and a brake from my Buick. My husband drives it the most, but I'm afraid we'll have to get rid of it before the warranty runs out. A transmission is something none of us like to fool with!<br><br>
