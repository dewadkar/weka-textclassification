            I really hate the thought of leaving my 1993 Mazda 626 ES behind when I move this summer, but after 4 years of Moscow winters and potholes, it's probably become acculturated and wouldn't know what to do on a U.S. highway again.

What sold me on this car over its competitors were the 5-speed stick (In 20 years, I've never owned a car with an automatic transmission), back seat room, comfort for long trips, V-6 engine and overall good lucks. I now know those features were just the tip of the iceberg. This car has also made me feel safe among Moscow drivers with its great pickup and other safety features. It's always started in the coldest weather. 

You'd think I wouldn't use the moonroof in Moscow, but it's great for getting an April tan when it's still 40 degrees outside.
