            As a stouch BMW lover for years and owner of a
1997 M3, 1998 540, 1997 528 and several other BMW's I did not take Lexus serisouly until I got my butt handed to me by one at the beach in front of my fiance. She said that she loved the style of the car and that it stood out whereas my 540 just sort of blended in with the crowd. I had to agree with her-thats why im marrying her,LOL. We went to the Lexus dealership and went for an extended test drive. First impressions. Im the king of the world. Luxury that none of my BMW's ever prosessed. No cheap or stark plastic here. Lexus did there homework well. The car was rock solid in feel and quiet as can be at highways speeds over 90mph. We negotiated and this electric blue LEXUS was now in my hands. My 540 lease was up soon anyways and the 540 gave me entirely too many problems in the 2 years of ownership. This Lexus received raves from all of my friends and coworkers. The unanimous conclusion was that they all prefered it over my BMW. Must be that BMW's are everywhere and nothing is special about them to the uninitiated though I still like them very much. But this GS400 was now the sparkle in my life. Acceleration is bit quicker than my BMW. Handling is not as good though with too much bodyrow. Brakes are very powerful and easily stops shorter than my 540. The headlights are a real cool feature when they level themselves automatically. I never thought thatI would need the navigation but now, no way would I ever buy a car without one. The Lexus one has been rated the best and now I know why. I have the GS on a 3 year lease. It will be a great 3 years im sure.
