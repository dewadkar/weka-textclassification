            When my husband and I first started looking at a four door car to buy, we checked out the Malibu, the Grand Prix, and the Alero.  By far, the Alero won.  We have a silver mist Alero with leather seats and a sun roof.  I truly think it's a comfortable ride.  The Malibu did not have as good of a ride and we just liked the style of the Alero better than the Grand Prix.  Something I love about this car is the little reminders (gas, tire pressure, time to change the oil, etc.)  It's nice to have the car remember these important things for me!  Everything is where it's supposed to be and easy to get to (the radio, glove compartment, heat/air).  The one thing I do have to say that has bothered me only a little is every once in a while, a glare from the sunroof will hit the glass that goes over the speedometer and makes a horrible blinding glare.  Easy enough to fix, you just shut the sun roof a little but then that makes the ride a little louder.  I don't understand this but if the sun roof is open all the way, it's quieter than having 1/2 open.  When I drive my Alero I feel totally in control.  The ride is wonderful, its tight, smooth steering makes the complete difference in my mind.  If you are looking for a sleek four door family car, this is it.  It's easy to get car seats in and out of the back seat.  You feel like you have so much room when you sit in the back seat.  You can actually stretch your legs out!  <br><br>
