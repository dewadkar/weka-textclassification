            Last year we returned to the states and my wonderful hubby decided we needed to get me a new car because that way it would last us many years and would come with a 3 year/30000 mile warranty. I was against the idea because I hadn't really driven a car in 8 years.

After looking around in our price range (under 20,000) on the internet, we only had a week once we got back into the states to get the car. We ended up going with a 1998 Chevy Malibu LS (we bought it right as the 99's were appearing on the lot)

My husband had had luck with Chevy's. It drove nice. It was comfortable. They had one LS fully loaded on the lot. It was maroon -- my high school color (not a great reason but better than the green) so we went with it.

It's a great car to drive. I've not had any troubles with control and handling. It's got two cup holders by the driver's seat. I love the automatic lock and unlock on the key chain -- comes in handy carrying a toddler and bags back to the car. There isn't a CD player, but it came with AM/FM radio with cassette. Of course, we later learned that there is a service bulletin out on this model. As delivered the antenna wire can easily be disconnected. They have to reroute it.

The only problem is in the last 14 months, it's been in twice for brake work. The said something about the front axle being warped so they've turned it. I'll admit I'm not a mechanic. I just know that the car will start making noise when I brake. When it gets really bad it gets a shimy when I try to stop going faster than 50 (in properly signed zones). We take it in. They put it on a lathe like thing and fix it.

After the last repair we brought up the fact that we've had it only for 14 months and have had it in twice. The manager said to come in before our warrenty expires and they'll replace the front axle. Of course after they do that and in six months when it needs to be turned again guess who gets to pay for that.

The other minor problem we had was the horn wouldn't honk if the wheels were turned forward. If the wheels were turned either way then the horn would work. That was weird and a hard one to explain. A year later the horn stopped working again (learned this when I took it in for state inspection). Seemed that there was a bad contact. It honked when I locked the doors, since I don't use the horn much while driving I had never noticed before.

Over all I like it. It works. It gets me from point a to point b, but if I had to do it again I would get something that wouldn't need this much brake work the first year. We really bought this car with the idea of it lasting me ten years. Right now with the brakes, I'm praying for five to seven.

Guess what! The horn isn't working again. Noticed it two weeks after it was in for the state inspection. They have to replace the airbag and the contacts AGAIN. Guess what, this was the same repair it needed the first time the horn went south.

Latest check. I've owned the car for almost exactly two years now. It's been in three times now for horn repairs and twice for brakes. And two times for the antenna until we got it repaired per a service order (which I was only aware of after reading another epinion)

If you want a good car, this ain't it.

Good news, the airbags do work. At least when you skid on the ice and hit a phone poll.....


<b>July 2001</b>

My car went in this month and guess what it got? New brake rotors (at 23,000 miles) and a new brain for the Air Conditioning controls.

Only a few months left on the warrenty. Thinking now we goofed by not buying the extended. Sure hope I don't have to get new rotors again at 46,000. Good news thought about the new rotors -- they seem to be heavier. Maybe they can be turned more than twice. Or even better -- not at all.

<b>September 2002</b>

Took a friend to Advance Auto Parts for a belt for her van. Got back to my car and the battery was completely bad. Right in front  of the batteries checked sign. Yep, the battery was dead. $65 dollars I was on the road again.

<b>October 2002</b>

Tire time. Had to go to Sam's club and buy four new tires. They were the best price at $75 a tire. We found quotes for the Chevy Malibu up to $155 a tire (Goodyear)

<b>April 2003</b>

Twice in the last month my new battery had to be jumped. So hubby took it back to check. The battery checked out; however, the 100 watt alternator was only putting out 50 watts of energy. It took my husband an hour, a $165 new alternator, and a new screw to fix. (The old alternator was held in place with a threaded screw -- the new one used a non-threaded screw).

According to the folks at Advanced Auto Parts these alternators fly off the shelves. GM switched to an internal fan and a computer chip instead of diodes. The computer chip burns out easily and there is no way to replace just the computer chip so folks have to replace the whole unit.



<b>August 2003</b>

New parts time. My car was using coolant faster than gas. Water pump died. Orginal only lasted 50,000 miles. 

Since the belt was almost shreaded, that got replaced too. Luckily an engine hoist isn't needed -- just jack up the engine on a board.
