            My 4-wheel drive Montero Sport is a great vehicle and a good investment.  It handles well and provides a good ride and alot of power for a foreign suv which surprised me. I have been through snow, sleet, mud, and sand and it has handled them all very well not getting stuck once, and this is with stock tires.

I got the LS package and for the money spent it is a very good vehicle. Nice interior, good sound system, including a cd player, and also plush interior(not leather, that comes with the XLS package).  It has alot of leg room, enough for even me and I am 6'4&quot;. All together if you are looking for a good sport utility vehicle for amount of money spent the Montero Sport is a good idea.<br><br>
