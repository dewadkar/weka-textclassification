               I bought a 94 Intrepid used with about 90 thousand miles on it a half a year ago.  I had been looking for something that was a little more roomy inside, and it seemed to fit the bill.  Anyway, after driving it for a while I have noticed a few things, both good and bad.  The thing that I love the most about it is how roomy it is inside without being an excessively bulky car to maneuver.  Another thing that struck me about the Intrepid was how sporty it looked.  That was a big turn on for me, considering I am a young man, and don't want to be driving around in my grandma's car, you know?  I have recently had a minor problem with the car, involving the starter.  One of my friends referred to it as a &quot;standard Chrysler starter problem&quot;, and from what I hear, that is not far from the truth.  Basically, it clicks for a while when i start it in the morning before it finally lights up.  It could be worse, I suppose.  I'd say that other than this minor problem, the Intrepid has been a really solid car for me, and i think that it is a good car for anyone who needs the extra room inside, but doesn't want to sacrifice looks for utility.<br><br>
