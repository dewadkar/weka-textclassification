            I am not impressed with the 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.  Featuring a terrible, trunk set up.  Basically, this car has no key hole to enter the trunk.  You always need to use the clicker to do so.  Unfortunately, my clicker broke, leaving me in a predictement.  Grocery shopping, Hands full, You guys can relate--As a result, I had to put down the items I had in hand, and open the trunk through the car door.  Normally, not a big deal, Unless--YOU WERE WITHOUT HANDS. 

To get me started on this car would not be a good idea!!  I am very disappointed with the luxury (for price), Starting with the uncomfortable seats, and lack of leg room.  Next, the steering is poor.  I have a lot of trouble controlling this vehicle-I ache when i leave this Jeep.  

The four wheel drive is very hard to get into--I almost had to pull my elbow out of the socket to get the car from 2wd to 4wd.  Many other things also irk me about this car.  Poor gas mileage etc etc. etc. 

What I do like is the fact that the tire is underneath the car in the 2000 edition.  Also it is a rather smooth ride!!  Great cornering is a + for this tank!!  I want to tell you, if you are going to buy a Jeep--Stick with the 1995-1998 Laredo's!! <br><br>
