            If your into worrying about getting your truck dirty than this truck is not for you.  The Silverado is a work truck thru and thru.  It will haul and carry what every you need to and still look good.  The classic body style is timeless.  Goes from the worksite to the shopping maul with ease. Built basic and tough.  If you scratch the paint, it adds character.

So far +12,000 miles, no problems. Handles like a truck.  I have made several long trips. Very comforatble!  Great visibiility all around.  I like the design layout, everything is in view and easy to reach.  The vehical is designed to be worked hard. Not to baby it. I trust this truck to take me to the work site and home.  I belive it will continue this for the next ten years.   

If you want a yuppie vehicle than buy a SUV.  If you want a truck that works harder than you do, buy this Chevy!  <br><br>
