            Traded my 95 avalon for the 2000 XLS loaded. Have 1300 miles on it now and continue to be impressed with this car. To me, it is so much better than My 98 Mercedes E320, which now sits in the garage. Paid $600 over invoice. The 100K warranty was a bargain in the $850 price range. Smooth and quiet, the CD is outstanding. Nothing but good things to say. No, I do not work for Toyota. It is great for the 6-2 plus guys and gals.<br><br>
