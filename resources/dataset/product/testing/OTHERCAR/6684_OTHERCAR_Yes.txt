            I absolutely adore this car.  When i first sat behind the steering wheel, i felt as if i were home.  I sank into the soft leather seats, and felt the engine push me intot my seat as I pushed down the accelerater.  I first saw this car when I was at a Bruins game, and I knew then that I wanted this car.  Now for the review<br>This is one of the safest cars that I have ever driven, other than the older volvo that I previously owned.  This car has an advanced safety system and roll bar which will protect you throughorly in a roll over accident.  Also, it is very good with gas mileage.  On the highway, it averages around 35 miles per gallon and around 25 miles per gallon in the city on high octance gasoline.  The engine itself is very nice.  Packing a punch, if you press down the accelerator, you will be pushed into your seat as the car accelerates quickly and smoothly.  Also, this car comes with an array of options, including heated rear seats, the full winter package, removable hard top, and much more.  This is a great car, and a must buy.<br><br><br>
