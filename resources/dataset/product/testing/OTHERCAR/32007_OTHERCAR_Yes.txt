            The HP Photosmart 215 is well worth the ~$160 price we paid for it at CDW.  This little gem is an inexpensive digital that provides great quality pictures.

The software that comes with the program, however, does not allow for easy conversion of pictures into gif or jpeg.  As an avid eBayer, I use this camera primarily for quality purposes.  While the camera provides me with strikingly high quality photos, I still have to take extra special time saving each one on the hard drive and then uploading to eBay's site.

Sure, the USB does provide quick access to the pictures that were just taken, but to me, the extra step required just to save the pictures is a hassle.  And it seems like the batteries go after 2 hours of use.  Whew, thank goodness for rechargeables!

On the plus side, the 4MB memory is upgradeable (cheaply) but you will rarely notice the need for it unless you take multiple photos of everything.  While the camera does allow you to take more pictures at lower quality (resolution), I don't recommend it.  The HP 215 is best used at it's highest quality and turned off after each use.
