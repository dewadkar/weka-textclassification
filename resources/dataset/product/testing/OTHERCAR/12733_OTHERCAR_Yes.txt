            I can honestly say I love my &quot;NEW&quot; Van.  It's not new but it's new to me and I love it.

A few weeks ago we bought a 1995 Nissan Quest.  I have wanted a minivan for about a year now, and I have looked at several models over that time.  Now, with epinions I have also read a lot about different vans.  

I read good things about this van, and since the price was in our range we went ahead and bought it.

We paid $10,500 for this 1995 Nissan Quest with 42,000 miles on it.  This is just the basic model so nothing is power.  You have to lock the doors and roll down the windows yourself.

Even before the test drive I had an idea that this was the van for me.  The Nissan Quest is smaller than some of the other minivans.  I liked that and I have noticed no difference in parking it or driving it.  And, it still comfortably seats 7 passengers.  I took my dad, 2 brothers and my SIL to lunch in it.  And, all the adults fit comfortably.

First thing I noticed when I got in to test drive this van were the seatbelts.  The shoulder belts for the driver and front passenger are automatic.  Meaning they automatically come across you when you start the vehicle.  You still have to remember to fasten your lap belt.  

The van started right up and the ride for the test drive was smooth as could be.  The van is arranged very nicely.  I liked the location of the drink holders off of the passenger seat.  The radio is positioned well and the feel of the van when you are driving is great.

The next thing I checked on the van was what was required of the seatbelts to install a child's car seat.  It has the locking seat belts, so when you pull the seat belt out all the way it locks.  This means you are not required to use a locking clip.

The mileage on the van is 18 mpg and this was driving around the city.  I wasn't too impressed with this but it is probably average for a van.  I don't know a lot of mechanics but this is a 6 cylinder.  

I am really impressed with this van.  I will be driving this van for several years.  But, when I look to get another minivan I will look again at the Nissan Quest!<br><br>
