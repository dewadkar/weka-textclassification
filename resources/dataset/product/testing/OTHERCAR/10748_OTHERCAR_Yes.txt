            We bought our 2003 Prius (brilliant blue pearl) in Feb. 2003.  We currently have 8600 miles on it!  I absolutely LOVE this car for its economy.  We average about 50 miles per gallon (+ or - 4 miles).  My husband and I started carpooling because it was so economical.

We could only find one dealership that had the options we were interested in -- cruise control, CD player, side airbags) - most dealerships have them pre-loaded THEIR way and any other option is out.  We didn't have a problem with availability -- there were at least a dozen in stock.

The other BIG advantage for us in buying this car (we traded in an Olds Alero) was that in Maryland there is NO SALES TAX on hybrid electric vehicles PLUS this tax year (2003) is the last year in which IRS will grant you a $2000 tax DEDUCTION (NOT credit) for buying a HEV.

We also just found out that our dealership (don't know if this applies to other dealerships) honors a "deal" with Toyota that ALL MAINTENANCE for the first 3 years or 36,000 miles is FREE!  We recently had our Schedule A service done and it did not cost us anything.

Getting back to performance of the car -- we drive a combination of divided highway and city traffic.  When you first get out on the road, if you are interested in maximizing the mileage per gallon, you don't gun it, you allow the car to gradually gain speed (0 to 60 in about 30).  That part drives my husband crazy.  But once you get it up to speed, you still get surprisingly good mileage.  It's easy to turn into a Prius "geek" -- my husband has gotten into the habit of coasting down the garage driveway at work thereby boosting MPG.  Best tankful to date is about 52 MPG.

I'm not happy that the onboard computer calculated mileage is not very accurate -- when compared to our notebook recorded calculations, there's a difference of usually 2 to 8 MPG (sometimes up, sometimes down).

The car is supposed to seat 5 - that would be squishy, but for four it's fine.  I find that this is our car of choice lately (our other car is a Toyota Sienna -- we gas that up about once/month now).  We have a range of about 500 miles before we need to fill it up.  Haven't taken it on long trips yet -- I'd be more comfortable in the minivan for a long trip.

No problems encountered with the paint (we do keep it garaged both at home and at work).  The digital controls don't distract us - we got used to them or you can turn off the touch screen.

We like what we've heard about the 2004 model (hatchback with a 60/40 split rear seat, controls on the steering wheel, and better fuel economy), but not enough to trade in a 6 month old car.

We haven't had any problems with the paint chipping.  It is NOT a luxurious car but you're buying the economy of the gas mileage not the interior -- it's adequate, not plush.  Most everything is standard -- automatic, A/C, cassette player (who plays cassettes anymore).  I probably wouldn't bother getting the cruise control next time and I understand that the 2004 model has the CD player standard.

I've recommended this car to many of my friends.

Update:  In response to several very relevant comments, it should be noted that the net HP for the Prius is only 98 HP, which is slightly less than that of a normal 4-cylinder car, like a Corolla.  So as far as peppy - it will get you up to speed, but not if you are in a hurry.

Although at first, it may throw you for a loop, yes, the gas engine does shut off if you are stopped at a traffic light.  You get used to it and appreciate the fact that you aren't wasting gas.

Regarding the automatic transmission, the transition in shifting from gear to gear is smooth as long as you aren't gunning the engine.

The car handles fairly responsively, just remember it's not a sports car.  For a small economic car it handles fine.  I especially like the size of the car, compared to my minivan, for ease in parking.  I can make U-turns in the middle of the street -- the turning ratio is great.

Braking tends to be a little different from what we're used to.  It's a bit more touchy than normal brakes because the gas engine shuts down when you apply the brakes so there is more engine breaking to assist in slowing down the car.  My husband had an incident this morning where he had to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting a pedestrian crossing a major roadway in the dark dressed in dark clothing.  The brakes were very responsive and the wheels did not lock (it has ABS) and an accident was avoided.

On-board controls are fairly intuitive to use -- we like that you can set the temperature (from 65 degrees up) and if you use the "auto" setting, it will maintain that temperature.  The 2004 has controls (audio, climate) on the steering wheel.

As far as interior noise, keep in mind - it's an economy car not a luxury car -- it's okay, not horrible.

Hope these additional comments help.
