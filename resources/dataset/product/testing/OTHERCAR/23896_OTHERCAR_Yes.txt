            In considering an SUV, I had two criteria of greatest importance.  First, I wanted a reliable vehicle.  Second, I wanted to make sure that if problems arose, they would be handled properly by the dealer.

I purchased a 1992 4Runner because I liked the look and because I had previously owned Toyotas and found them to be very reliable.  Don't expect the Toyota SUV to ride like a sedan.  The suspension is much stiffer and it rides like a truck (at least the four-wheel-drive version does).  After a year of ownership, I liked the vehicle enough to purchase a second 4Runner for my wife.  As of the beginning of the year 2000, we have had virtually no maintenance problems...with one exception.  And it is here the service stands out.

Driving home from work I blew a head gasket and seized the engine.  At the time the '92 4Runner had 98,000 miles.  It turns out that Toyota had put a recall on 4Runners from about '91 to '95 for head gaskets.  The recall spelled out full factory replacement at no cost to the customer up to 100,000 miles.  I was glad my '92 had come under that window.  The dealership (Larry H Miller Toyota in Salt Lake City) did a really nice job and had a new head gasket on in a couple of days.  What's more, while they had the engine apart, they put in a new timing belt and a few other extras complimentary!  Now I was impressed with the service!

But I had a problem.  The '93 4Runner had 110,000 miles on it and did not fall in the recall window, yet needed the head gasket replaced.  The dealership told me to bring it in and they would contact Toyota to see if they would OK the recall for this vehicle.  Toyota quickly OKed it and the service was performed once again at no cost to me.

In short, the 4Runner is possibly the most maintenance free vehicle I've ever seen, and when service is performed, it is a stress-free operation.

Incidentally, the '92 and '93 4Runners each have 135,000 and 165,000 miles respectively and are both going strong.  I don't expect to sell them for at least another 5 years.<br><br>
