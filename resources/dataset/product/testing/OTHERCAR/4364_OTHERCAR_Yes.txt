            For nearly two decades I've driven the likes of station wagons, various minivans and SUV's as I participated in the suburban ritual of carting my kids and their friends to those activities that will encourage them to succeed in life so they could one day cart their kids and their friends to those activities that will encourage them to succeed in life so they could one day cart their kids.... (Have I reached 100 words yet?) So when my second of four children drove off to college in our bright red 3000GT (the subject of a future review) I hurriedly turned in our big, lunky Eddie Bauer Expedition (the subject of a previous review) and bought our first Beamer.  I realized two things right away: One, I sure miss the seven seats of the Expedition, and two, I sure love the BMW!  

After three years of slowing to a crawl to take corners in the Ford SUV, gaining confidence in a vehicle with a near perfect 50-50 front/back weight distribution and a very effective Active Traction Control system was a quick process.  Grippy tires and 15 inch wheels contribute to side loading I haven't seen since riding the &quot;Avalanche&quot; ride at the county fair.  No matter how quickly I punch the throttle, even in the middle of a decreasing radius turn, I can't loosen the the back end of this rear wheel drive car.  When my wife, who doesn't appreciate exploring the edges of a car's performance envelope, isn't along for the ride, disengaging the Traction Control system allows me to use the throttle to precisely oversteer as the car accelerates out of a turn.  A manual transmission, or a &quot;selectronic&quot; option would increase the car's control as low end torque suffers from the sub 200 BHP engine.  Passing acceleration, though, is more than adequate as the powerband peaks above around 3500RPM.

The car is tighter and more precise than any of the Japanese counterparts we test drove, and although the ride is a bit harsh for a car it's size, that is a necessary cost for an accurate feel of the road.  The ride is firmer than even our equally horsepowered 3000GT but I believe the BMW could outperform it on a slalom course.  The GT, though low slung, suffers from torque steer typical of front wheel drive cars, and lacks the Traction control system that serves the Beamer so well. 

Ergonomics are excellent except for the unadjustable steering wheel which forces a near straight armed, racing driver position.  The electric seats have a wide range of motion negating some of the steering wheel's limitations.  The seats are comfortable and heated, and all controls and switches are within easy reach of the driver.  There is an abundance of control switches which I prefer in lieu of the trend of multi-function switches that need multiple actuation to activate an intended function.  Dual zone temperature controls are effective while the mass-flow vents (more air volume, less air speed) means quieter air conditioning without annoying drafts.  

From a performance perspective, the 383 has proven to satisfy everything I expected from a BMW.  Whether or not I'll stay happy with this firm, young, sexy thing or find new love with some plush, nurturing, Japanese luxury car in the future, I don't know.  I DO know that my youngest son (12 years old) fully expects to inherit it when he turns sixteen.  Maybe then I'll be asking him if I could borrow HIS car keys every once in a while.
