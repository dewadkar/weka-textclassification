            When it comes to cameras I know nothing, let alone digital cameras. The Polaroid PDC-640 is so simple to use, that even someone who is as inexperienced as I am can use it like a pro. There's no need to really worry about making mistakes, since all you do is just point and click with it's built-in flash and auto-focus. The LCD viewfinder is a nice added feature, because you can preview your image before you transfer it to your computer. If your not happy with the image, you can just delete it right through the viewfinder.

I was leary about whether my images would be fuzzy or blurry, like some of the lower price cameras tend to be. I was amazed that such an affordable camera could take such sharp, crisp and professional-looking images as this can. The memory card that comes with it holds 36 images in the 640x480 mode, and 96 images in the lower resolution mode of 320x240. If you chose to set it at the lower resolution, you will notice fuzziness.It is also very simple to hook up to the computer, one cable end in the camera, the other in the back of your PC. It also comes with a video cable so you can view your images on your TV screen as well. I don't how other digital cameras compare, but this seems to go through AA batteries quite often. But it does come with an AC plug adaptor which is very convenient. <br><br>
