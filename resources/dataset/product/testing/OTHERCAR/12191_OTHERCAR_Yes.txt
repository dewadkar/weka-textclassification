            This is not a car for the meek, I can say that!  I recently purchased a 2001 Firebird Trans Am and these are my initial observations.  
     First of all, this car is fast, perhaps too fast.  The very powerful 5.7L V8 engine with 310hp is as much as I care to handle.  Don't get me wrong, the WS6, Ram Air model is awesome with the additional 15hp, extra intake, 17" high performance tires, and 12 disk CD changer, but in my opinion, these options are not worth the extra cost. FYI, you can purchase the supercool hood with the "nostrils" for about an extra thousand bucks and have it installed, if you're like me and just want the bad a** look of the RamAir version. I can give you the name of the company if you e-mail me.
     The suspension is tight, but not without "give."  I don't find the ride particularly jarring, or bumpy on uneven surfaces.  But, this is not a luxury sedan either, so don't expect a satin-smooth ride. 
     The "hurst" shifter is supposedly an additional option, but I couldn't find a 6 speed in all of California without it.  The shifting is somewhat "notchy," and there is a special gas saving feature they call Skip Shift that, when speed and RPMs are just right, force you to shift from 1st directly to 4th, that I don't find particularly appealing.  I don't like it when the engine lags as you are forced into this situation.  Actually, it's rather aggravating.  The salesman was not only unaware of this feature, but also did not know whether or not it could be deactivated.  
     The radio controls are mounted on the steering wheel so that you can keep both hands on the wheel.  But, if you have the 6 speed like I do, your hands are off the wheel fiddling with the shifter anyways.  It's a neat little convenience, but because of this, the steering wheel is obscuring many of the gauges on the panel.  The speedometer, and tachometer are in clear view, however.  
     There is little room in the back seat and not very much cargo space in the trunk, especially if you have the T-tops off because this is where the storage area is for them when they are not in use.  To its credit, the seats to fold down if need be to make room for maybe one large suitcase and a duffle bag, or a large load of groceries (hey I'm a chick, I consider these things!)
     Visibility while sitting in the driver's sit is hindered by the bulge of the rear end of the vehicle and compounded by the massive spoiler that sticks out like a shark fin.  I have been in the habit of glancing over my shoulder to check my blind spot anyways, so I don't find this to be a terrible inconvenience (actually I think all drivers should do this regardless of what car they drive).  There is no rear window to assist in checking the blind spot.  Responsible drivers who are paying attention should not have much of a problem in this area.  I will say that driving this car does command a lot of your attention and I wouldn't recommend driving like my husband, you know, coffee in one hand, reading a map, changing the CD, and eating a bagel all at the same time (beware he IS out there!).  
     The only other cons I can see are that it sucks gas like it's going out of style and your insurance will probably increase by a few bucks a month (mine went up about 30 smackers, big deal).  
     OK, so that's the bad news.  The good news is, let's face it...this car ROCKS!!!  There is nothing quite like stomping on the accelerator and feeling the massive power surging forward at your command.  The incredibly sexy styling grabs the attention of anybody with a pulse (or maybe it's the 8 speaker, kick a** Monsoon sound system with 8 band equalizer pulsing with sound, either way...).  And the performance is unbelievable!  It corners like it's on rails and hugs the road like stink on you know what!  In my opinion, this is the coolest of the F-body sports cars out there.  If you're into hot looks, fast, responsive engines, excellent sound and performance, grab this car while you still can.  It's bound to be a collector's item as GM has stupidly decided to retire it with 2002 being the last year of production.  See you on the road, catch me if you can!  :)
