               Before anyone bashes me for giving my article such a nasty title, let me explain my point. Japanese brand vehicles are far superior to domestics in reliability and build quality. This may cause some commotion, but the track record shows this. I know that there are some people that may have contradictions based on their experiences, but most owners who've experienced owning both will agree with me. 
   My Jeep was the most unreliable vehicle I've ever owned. I purchased it after selling my previous car,a 1987 Suzuki Samurai. Mine was a black on gray,Wrangler Sport soft top with a 4.0 liter in-line 6 with a five speed manual. The only factory options I had were air conditioning, stereo with sound bar, 5 spoke wheels with matching spare, tilt steering wheel, and Light Group. My aftermarket accessories were double-tube, off-road bumpers with off-road lights and tow hitch, Steel Horse storage bins on both sides of back seat w/speakers and Steel Horse center console with beverage cooler. 
   As you see, I still have some admiration for the Jeep. It was the my dream car since high school. There were some pros to owning it. First of all, it had a very powerful 6 cylinder engine, and I had personalized it to my expectations. The power was a plus since I had previously owned a Suzuki Samurai. There was always power on reserve. In fact, I rarely took the Jeep above 2500 RPMs because there was never a need to. 
   It was great for the first year and then the slave cylinder went out. Three weeks later, the master cylinder went out. At this time, I only had 34,000 miles on it and two major repairs. At 41,000 miles both slave and master cylinders had to be replaced again. This time, the clutch had to be replaced also. At 48,000 miles, the E-brake cable broke. Two weeks later, the driver's seat seat back broke.While I was at the dealer getting the seat repaired, a lady (in her early to mid 50's) was buying a bunch of parts for her Wrangler. She owned a 1991 Wrangler and she worked on it herself. Her response on the constant problems I had with my Jeep was,"constant repairs goes with Jeep ownership." She had owned four others in the past, and she had to work on those frequently as well. Sounds like it wasn't that big of a deal? I was a college student that didn't have time to take this Jeep into the dealer on a regular basis. Luckily, all the repairs were under warranty or it would have depleted what funds I had at the time as well. 
   My other gripe was the fuel economy. I knew it when I bought it, but I had never owned a gas-hog before. The fuel alone was breaking me. I commuted 65 miles round trip to school daily in traffic. Jeeps aren't the best vehicles for that type of driving. Buy a 4 cylinder? No way. It's gutless, and the gas mileage isn't any better. The motor sounds like it's running hard all the time.
   The negatives outweigh the positives, but how many vehicles get so much attention and respect from fellow Jeep owners and other drivers as well? It's unbeatable off-road but the reliability really sucks. My Samurai never gave me a problem and I had twice as many miles on it. If you're  the average Japanese car owner, one problem is too much. The 6 cylinder motors are bullet-proof, but the other stuff is the problem here. I will never buy another one again.

P.S. The 2nd owner started having the same problems I had within a year of purchasing it from me at 54,000 miles. Last time I spoke to him, he was selling it.
