            The C70 is Volvo's first DESIRABLE car since the original Volvo P1800.  It comes in 2-door coupe and convertible, and has two available 5-cylinder engines, with a choice of manual or automatic transmissions.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: This Volvo is truly sexy.  Although it is still based on the original 1993-design Volvo's, the body has been rounded a bit to create a very stunning sports car.  The standard 16-inch wheels look OK at best.  The optional 17-inch wheels are very stylish and fill up the wheel wells almost entirely.  There is also a dealer-installed option for a lowered sport suspension and 225/40ZR-18 high performance tires.  The styling of this version is absolutely spectacular!

<b>INTERIOR</b>: The C70 is relatively quiet, but the optional 17-inch wheels and tires do make a lot of noise.  Most of the instruments are well-placed and fairly easy to understand, but some switches are blocked by the steering wheel.  All C70's have a generous amount of headroom even for tall drivers, myself included.  The seats are well-designed and are VERY comfortable for long trips.  The rear seats, however, are uninviting.  The convertible's rear seats are noticeably narrower than the coupe's.  The coupe has a fairly generous amount of cargo room for a sports car, but the convertible version uses up most of the trunk for the convertible top.  Some standard features include dual-zone electronic climate control, power windows and door locks, power front seats, a high-power AM/FM/CD/cassette stereo system with ten speakers, and front and rear fog lights.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The coupe comes only with one engine option.  A 2.3-liter, high-pressure turbocharged and intercooled inline 5-cylinder engine that produces 236 horsepower at 5,400 rpm, and 243 lb./ft. of torque at 2,400 rpm.  All this power is transferred through either a standard 5-speed manual transmission, or an optional 5-speed automatic transmission.  The convertible model comes with either the high-pressure turbo engine, or a 2.4-liter low-pressure, turbocharged and intercooled engine.  It produces a milder 190 horsepower at 5,100 rpm, and 199 lb./ft. of torque at an extremely low 1,600 rpm.  This engine comes only with the 5-speed automatic.  Although I prefer the 2.3's extra power and torque, the 2.4 has less turbo lag.  I averaged 20.2 mpg on the mandatory premium fuel.

<b>HANDLING</b>: The brakes are very strong. The steering wheel is a bit firmer, to me, than most other Volvo's, but is suitable enough for a sports car.  With the 16-inch wheels, the car handles fairly well.  The 2.3 models come with a stiffer suspension and standard 17-inch wheels and provide a much more entertaining ride.  This car was MADE for twisty mountain roads.  The optional 18-inch wheels with high-performance tires are even better at handling.

<b>RIDE</b>: With the 16-inch wheels, the ride is stiff, but never jarring.  With the low-profile 17-inch wheels, the ride is annoyingly choppy.  If comfort is more important than style to you, you will be much better off with the 16-inch wheels.  I prefer style over comfort, and thus can live with the constant pounding.  The 18-inch wheels are positively unforgiving.  Avoid at all costs if you plan on using your C70 as a daily driver.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: Again, I feel Volvo has skimped (albeit somewhat) on reliability.  Although no recalls have been issued for any 2002 Volvo, any Volvo C70 made between 01/1997 - 11/2000 was issued a recall.  For more information about this recall, see this website:

<b>VALUE</b>: C70's are stylish fun to drive sports cars.  Although BMW's 3-series convertible are less expensive than a C70 convertible and offer superior road manners, the C70 is worth a test drive at the very least.
