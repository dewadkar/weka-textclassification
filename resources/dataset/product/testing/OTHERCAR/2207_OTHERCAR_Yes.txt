            If you are looking for a sports car and don't want to spend like a billion dollars on decent one, the honda prelude is the car for you. If you are deciding to go ahead and get the prelude, then I would recommend the v-tec model. The v-tec model comes with 200hp(horse power) as aposed to 160hp. I would also recommend getting the 1992-96 model of this car because it is a v6(six cylender engine). The newer models have a more efficient 4 cylender engine but you can do much more to a v6. Not only is the prelude a cheaper sports car, but it is also a great looking vehicle. The inner portion of the car is slightly small yet has not too little room. <br><br>
