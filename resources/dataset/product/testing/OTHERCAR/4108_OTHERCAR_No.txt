            My Intrigue handles the road just beautifully! I always feel confident when I accelerate when entering the freeway, and can switch into lanes without any obstruction of view.  The ride is extra smooth on highways, and when a bump appears, the impact is slight. I love the fact that my headlights turn on and off by themselves as I can easily forget to turn them off.  I have taken several long trips, and found that the folding rear seats, there are two of them, can store long packages on one side only if I choose. I feel extremely safe at night, because when I turn on my changing signal there are cornering lamps that light up the entire road from that angle. The steering of my Intrigue requires little to no effort, and it is sensitive to my touch.  I bought this car because of it handling, the smooth exterior lines, for the price, I was happy.  Until.....I realized that the quality of my Intrigue at 40,000 miles is going really hard and fast!  The molding that connects the window frames to the door is coming off, and the double seal around the windows is sticking to my windows and tearing apart. If they put as much money into their quality as their advertising, I would have little to fuss over!  The carpeting in the front is already worn where our left foot sits!  I can't believe that General Motors didn't put the same quality into this as their Buick line up. Also, the seats are way too short, and too hard. If you compare the seats in the front to the Buick Regal and the Intrigue, you can see, and feel the difference.  I did that, and am now sorry. I would now purchase the Buick Regal, without the super charged engine because of the seating alone.  They both have the same engines, and the mechanics are the same. But, the Intrigue just LOOKS BETTER!  YES?  I was also single when I purchase this car, having no mates or additional family members, I suddenly got a great man that has two kids, and I would not buy this car if I had a family to haul around.  The back seat is too small for the children, and hard to get in and out of.  The back seat cup holder is broken, and since the children's safety is my concern, the crash test results were nothing but scary. If you are single, take short trips, want decent gas mileage, and performance, buy the Intrigue for your money. If you have a family, take long trips, go for the Buick Regal for the same performance, but comfort.  <br><br>
