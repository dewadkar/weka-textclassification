            If you're into the name factor, then I guess you have a reason for looking into this car, but that is about the only reason you have.  For the price and everything that comes with it, look at the Nissan Maxima.  Granted it doesn't have the &quot;prestigious&quot; name of &quot;Infiniti&quot;, but for the same price (or less), you can get a lot more car.  I test drove the G-20 and it just felt very small and cramped - like a compact car - compared to the Maxima - which feels and looks like a full-size car.  To be honest, I don't know why they call the Maxima a compact car, because if you put it next to the G-20, Accord, or Camry, it certainly looks bigger and commands a lot more power.  Call me a Maxima fan, but really it comes down to pure economics.  You're paying a 25% premium just for the name, and that's about it.  To read my review about the Maxima go over to the Nissan Maxima section and look for a review by &quot;expertadvice&quot;.  Happy driving.<br><br>
