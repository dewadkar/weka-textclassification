            I own a 1996 Subaru Loyale.  I admit it's not what I wanted and I will never buy a never one.  I bought it because it was cheap and it had very few miles on it.  A seventy-something year old couple owned it before me, I will also never buy another car that was owned by an older couple.  This car has no power, I don't care if it is a four cylinder.  I owned a 1988 Toyota Corolla FX and it was a four cylinder, it had twice the power my Subaru has.  It's an easy car to drive.  

And I admit it does have some nice features.  The lights turn off when you shut the car off.  Great for someone who forgets to turn the lights off, like myself.  It dings when you leave the keys in the ignition.  There is plenty of room, unless you are going to be transporting a lot of people.  The trunk has plenty of room.  However, the oil seals pop far too easily.  The gas milage is crappy.  And again, it has no power.  

All in all it would make an ok car for a first time driver or as in my case an older couple, it's hard to speed in etc.  But for the seasoned driver I recommend you keep looking and buy yourself another car.<br><br>
