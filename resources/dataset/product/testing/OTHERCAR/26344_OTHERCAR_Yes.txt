            This is the first digital camera I've owned. I've briefly used friends' in the past and learned how wonderful these things are! So this year I finally got one as a present. Nonetheless, I'm not exactly an electronic guru, I just know the simple facts, as an average user.

<b>POWER:</b> 

So I get an awesome digital camera as a gift, and what do I do? Take it out of the box and begin snapping away? No... 

The Sony DSC-171 uses 2 AA rechargeable Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries (which are included, with a recharger). And it takes up to 13 hours to charge them. NOTE: The manual specifies that the Sony DSC-171 cannot be used with regular AA alkaline batteries. 

So unless you also bought the AC adapter, or happen to have some fully charged Nickel-Metal Hydride AA batteries handy, you have to wait about 13 hours while the batteries charge before you can use your camera. But I do like the fact that the camera comes with a recharger. 

The camera can also be used with an AC power adapter, but that is not included and must be purchased separately. The manual suggests that you use the AC adapter when downloading your photos or printing them, so the camera does not shut off in the middle of the process. (FYI: I didn't get one.) 

And when the camera runs out of batteries, it shuts off without retracting and closing the lens - and you can't retract or close the lens until you replace the batteries. So be sure to turn your camera off as soon as you get the low-battery warning, or else you could be stuck with your lens open and sticking out, which can be inconvenient. 

<b>MEMORY: </b>

The pictures you take are stored on a teeny little thing called a Memory Stick, which is shorter than a stick of gum. The camera comes with a 16mb Memory Stick, which stores about: 

96 of 640x480 pictures 
16 of 1600x1200 pictures 
10 of 2048x1536 pictures 

(Not a comprehensive list, but just to give you an idea ...) 

I eventually bought another Memory Stick (128mb, which cost about $80.00). 

<b>LOOKING AT YOUR PICTURES: </b>

To get the pictures from your camera onto your computer (so you can e-mail or print them!), you can use the Video Out port and the included USB cable. Before you do this, you need to install a USB driver, which is on the enclosed CD-ROM - This is quite easy, and should take just a few minutes. 

(If you have a Sony computer, you can also just remove the Memory Stick and pop it right into your computer.) 

You can also look at your pictures on a television with the included RCA video cable. Instant slide show of your vacation pictures anywhere there is a television! 

<b>PICTURE QUALITY: </b>

The Sony DSC-171 has a resolution of 3.2 Megapixels. I'm not sure exactly what this means, but it appears that the more Megapixels you have, the better your picture quality. 

Without much experience with other digital cameras, all I can say is that my pictures look really great! When I print them on photo paper using my ink jet printer, they look almost as good as a 35mm print to me - great colors and crisp images. 

I did have a chance to compare my Sony photos with the photos I took with the Polaroid PDC-640, which has less than 1 Megapixel - and what a world of difference. 

<b>ZOOM: </b>

The Sony DSC-171 has an Optical Zoom of 3X and and Digital Zoom of 2X, for total zoom power of 6X. I think the 160mm zoom on my 35mm camera was a little more powerful, but the 6X zoom on the Sony DSC-171 is just fine for what I need. 

<b>DESIGN / EASE OF USE: </b>

The camera is a good, compact size, and fits nicely in my hand. And all the controls, like the Mode Dial, the Control Button, and the Zoom Button, are well-placed and comfortable to use. 

I also had no trouble with the menu, or the other functions of the Sony DSC-171. After just a few minutes with the manual, it was easy to figure out how to do everything I wanted. I was able to begin using the camera right away (once the batteries were charged, that is). 

So this camera is easy to use, even for a newbie like me! 

<b>MOVIE: </b>

I was surprised to discover that you can record little movies with the Sony DSC-171, which you can download as MPEG files onto your computer. There is no sound, and the picture quality isn't great, so it's hardly a substitute for a camcorder, and nothing more than a fun little gimmick. But it's handy if you ever want to send a little digital footage via e-mail. 

<b>MISC: </b>

Aside from the initial cost of the camera, I expect that most people will want to invest in some accessories to enhance their use of the camera: 

Memory Stick (128mb) - about $80-90 each 
Extra Ni-MH batteries - about $6-8 for a package of 2 
Case (Model LCS-CP2) - about $20 from sonystyle.com 
AC adapter - about $40 from sonystyle.com 


All in all, I'm really happy with the Sony DSC-171. This will be a great, convenient way to keep and share my memories for a long time to come.
