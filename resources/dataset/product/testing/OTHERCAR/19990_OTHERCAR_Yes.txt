            A dear friend purchased a 1994 Lexus ES300, and I have had five plus years to form an opinion on this stellar automobile.  There are those out there who would call it a Country Club Camry, (and I even ranted against the Lincoln Navigator for the same reason), but I assure you the Lexus is NOT.  

One, the Lexus is the quietest automobile I have EVER driven.  On several occasions, I have nearly burned up the starter, thinking that the car was not even turned on when in fact it was idling.  Road noise---forget it!  Wind noise--none, even though the doors are frameless.

Two, the car is powerful!  Push the gas, and before you know it you are cruising down the highway at ninety miles an hour.

Three, the seats are wonderful...the front seats adjust in every way you can imagine, so you can make them fit you like a glove. 

Four, the car is so well designed.  The big audio and climate controls are natty looking and work well.  The exterior hits a perfect chord between sophistication, luxury, and sportiness.

Five, Lexus owners do not just get a car.  This may sound silly, but anytime I have been along for trips to the dealership, we have been greeted BY NAME at the door, treated to coffee and danish (served on real plates and cups, not styrofoam) and basically treated as if we were the only customers they had.

Now this wouldnt be a fair epinion if I didnt give the downside of this wonderful car.  There have been mechanical problems...including a blown engine at 85,000 miles, and a failed power steering pump shortly before that.  I attribute this to improper maintainance, since the nearest Lexus dealer to my friend is some hour and a half away. They were advised to use only SYNTHETIC motor oil in the new engine--the representative told them that these engines work hotter than most and tend to &quot;gum up&quot; traditional motor oils.  

So, my epinion is that the Lexus ES300 is definitely worth the premium over the Camry, and a certain stand-out among others in its class.  Haev the regular maintainance done at the Lexus dealer, and you will have a reliable car for years!
