            I own the LX model with a manual transmission.  It has been awesome.  I bought it in 1997 because consumer reports recommended it.  It had 123,000 miles on it.  I've owned it for 5 years and have only had to replace parts that wear out over time: spark plugs, timing belt, etc.  Never has my Mazda failed me!<p>I am 6 foot 3 and barely fit in it.  The seats adjust in and out on your back to your preferred comfort, it has a sliding sun roof that still works, power seat belts, oscillating vents, power windows and locks.  It is also a 2.2 liter, more than adequate power for a 4 cylinder engine.  The paint is starting to fade after 11 years.<p>I have a friend who owns the same year and model as me, he commutes to work 80 away everyday and has over 300,000 miles on the same engine.  These cars are very reliable.  Although it sounds like the automatics have some trouble.
