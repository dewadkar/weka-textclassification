            In more ways than one, the 2001 Buick Regal (functionally the same as the 2000) I rented was not your average rental car. I picked up my white Regal LS from National Car Rental on a week-long rental. 

Actually, I picked up two white Regals. The first was returned to the agency after the oil warning lights lit up like a Christmas tree on my way to the hotel. The second Regal was actually better equipped than the first, with the optional Gran Touring package, and I was also able to get a remote keyless entry key-fob.

Both Regals were surprisingly well equipped, with leather interiors, auto-climate control, steering-wheel audio controls, and 6-speaker CD/Cassette stereo systems. However, I did note that the leather seemed more like vinyl, and the controls for the climate control were needlessly complex. The tactile feel of the controls were much better than GM's previous efforts.

The 3.8 V6 was smooth and powerful, and gas mileage was exceptional for a large engine (I calculated about 25-28 mpg, with a mix of highway and residential streets). 

Overall, the Regal was a welcome deviation from the typical rental car. Hopefully the problem with my first Regal was just a fluke and not a reflection of more serious quality issues in an otherwise fine sedan.
