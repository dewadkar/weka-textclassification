            I am a college student and after going through two cars in two years, I decided I needed something a little bit more pratical and dependable.  I drive about 1000 miles a week so I needed something that could take a beating.  I shopped several dealerships and finally found my 1996 cavalier.  It came with a little warrenty and low miles.  It was also within my price range and the insurance was reasonable.  I put 40,000 miles on my car in eight months, and the car is still going strong.  I have had no problems with my car.  Although it is not a sports car so the insurance is cheaper, it has the look when you get the coupe.  I would recommend this car to any teenage driver, or anyone that needs a cost efficient and dependable ride.<br><br>
