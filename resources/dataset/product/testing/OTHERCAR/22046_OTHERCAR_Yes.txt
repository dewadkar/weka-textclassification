            My husband and I bought this camera over a year ago. It's still going strong. We haven't had any problems with it and we've been satisfied.

About the camera: It is gold which is neat because it makes it look nice and look expensive. On the right front, around the side and a small portion of the back has rubber on it where you can hold it and feel comfortable. It has a small LCD screen on the back to view your pictures. It have the typical on/off switch, zone switch, and it has buttons for scrolling through it's menus and for scrolling through pictures.  It also has a viewfinder. It also has a wrist strap.

It has the button on top for taking pictures and three other small buttons. I know that one is for choosing the type of flash to use, but the other two I'm not sure of. On the top is also a small screen that tells you battery life, type of flash you're using and how many pictures are left. 

The front has the flash and other side of the viewfinder. The lens can zoom in and out and comes with a cover that is attached by a short cord to the camera. 

Quality of pictures: The pictures are great! You can decide what types you want, like standard or high, good, better or best. When you have it on standard and good, you still get great pictures and at this setting you can take up to around 120 pictures on the card it comes with. On best and high, you can around 40. 

We have taken pictures with this camera and have printed them out on the printer and they have been great. Most of my friends can't tell the difference between a picture taken with 35mm and one with the digital. It's awesome!

The card: The camera came with an 8MB card. It pops into the right side and there's a cover to cover it. You have to press a small level to take it out. It would be better if it came with a larger card, but this one works fine for us.

The LCD: The LCD screen is about an 1 1/2 inches all the way around. Plenty big to see the picture you took. You can also set the camera where you can look through it like a movie camera, but it drains the batteries.

The batteries: We have been using rechargeable from day one. A friend recommended that we do that and we did. Having the rechargeables seem to last longer and we don't have to keep buying batteries. We just remember to charge them at night and we are fine. We do have about 8 batteries though. It takes four and we always have a back up. Using regular batteries seem to drain faster and the camera doesn't work as good.

Overall: We absolutely love this camera. It has been a great investment and it's a neat way to get pictures to all the relatives via e-mail. It would highly recommend this one!
