            I bought my Astro from the dealer in '95.  It was a program van and had 16,000 miles on it.  Now, in Sept 2000, it has 163,000 miles and still runs strong.  The engine is still tight - doesn't leak or use oil at all.  I run synthetic oil in it and change the oil every 10,000 miles.  Plus I've only dropped about 2MPG since I bought it.

I pulled the seats immediately and use it as an SUV.  I store my kayak and all camping gear inside.  On a kayaking trip, we'll load 5-6 kayaks on top, people inside and drive into and out-of some pretty bad roads to get to the river.  I've never been stuck (but have been worried a few times!).

I'm just now needing to completely overhaul the brakes.  This time new rotors, drums, etc.  Not bad for 163K miles!

Cons - I'm now on my third transmission.  The first failed at 60K miles and was replaced under warranty (yes - I bought an extended warranty).  The second gave out at 150,000 miles.<br><br>
