            I bought a silver '94 B2300 in 1997 which had 25,000 miles on it.  Got it for about $7,400 and have loved it.  It has a 5 speed, bucket seats, 2.4 liter engine.  It is a great truck for a high school kid to get around town and make trips in.  I never have had to do anything to it besides change the oil and buy new tires.  I went to college in at West Point and left it sitting in the drive way for my first two years there.  It started right up every time I got home, which was about once or twice every six months.  Last spring break my girlfriend and I drove it up from Tennessee to New York in a round about fashion.  We put 1,800 miles on it in about two and a half days and it never gave us a single problem, even in the Appalacian Mountains.  My truck has almost 60,000 miles on it now is still running strong.  The few negatives I have seen are in the size of it.  I wish I had gotten the king cab because you can not carry anything at all behind the bucket seats.  I'm 6' tall and have to have them all the way back with a little bit of recline in the seat to get comfortable.  Another negative is the small engine, I must downshift to fourth anytime I hit a hill or want to gain any speed at all on the highway.  When I fist got the truck it had a slight rattle up underneith that I noticed at slow speeds.  It ended up being from a loose muffler guard, which a fixed real quick with a slight tap of a hammer on the holding bracket to mash it back down, haven't had that problem in 3 years now.  I recently put a soft bed cover on it for about $200 and my gas mileage went from 22 mpg to 24 on the highway.  The bed cover also helps it ride much smoother and allows me to carry stuff in the back for trips, a definant great investment.  The air conditioner is good, and it has the best heater I have ever seen in a truck.  The Mazda custom wheels are also nice, which came on the truck.
   Since the truck was technically made by Ford it has striking similarities to a '94 Ford Ranger.  You absolutely can not tell the difference in the two trucks.  My dad has a '93 explorer and our interiors are exactly the same; bucket seats, dash, center consol, even the radio is made by Ford.  I've even seen a few spots up under it where they didn't even change the name and it says "Ford" still.  Yet a '94 Ford was still about $1,500 to $2,000 more at the time I bought it.  I could not be happier with this truck and do not forsee trading it in anytime soon.
