            Hmmmm..... well I hope this got you attention.  I leased a Mercury Mountaineer 13 months ago, I have to admit, it's overall a great car.  It handles well, gets good mileage for a V-8 (302 fuel injected) about 19 to 25 miles per gallon depending on conditions. The leather seats are very comfortable and supportive (my wife has back problems and since she has been driving this car, her legs don't go to sleep on trips.  The CD/cassette player is very nice, easy to operate, and sounds great. The air conditioning is very adequate without a drain on the engine. The frame is very durable, and the front end stays in alignment. The overdrive automatic transmission is superb.

During this 13 month period, we have had NO service at all (except scheduled maintenance). Except for....(read on) 

So,,,,, you say to yourself...so what's the hesitation?  Why not endorse this as GREAT!!!????

Well, this is it....THE ENGINE HAS &quot;SPARK KNOCK&quot; THAT NO ONE CAN FIX!!!!!  It drives us nuts, we bought it to use as a car and also to tow a small load (either a small utility trailer, or horse trailer with no more that 3,000 lbs. total tow weight) Mercury says it's rated for 9,500 lbs the way we set it up.  

THE SPARK KNOCK HAPPENS WHETHER WE ARE TOWING OR DRIVING WITH NO LOAD. The dealer assures me that &quot;They all do that&quot;...What a bunch of bologna! They have attempted to fix it several times, each time telling me it must be the gas.  I have used EVERY kind of gas, every brand, every grade, without relief from this.  It has done it since about day #2.

Oh well,,,in 23 months it will once again be in the dealer's hands, as I will in no way buy that vehicle, even though I love everything else about this SUV.

If you have any questions, I will respond to e-mails at rb6262@bellsouth.net.
