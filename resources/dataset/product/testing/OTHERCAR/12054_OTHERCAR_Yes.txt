            If you are picky don't buy this car. But I'll share the few problems I had with it. My Right headlight needed to be replaced the seal was defective (it got water inside). The remote alarm unit went out around 19K, replaced by dealer. The catalytic insulation crumbled after 19K, it produced a rattling sound upon downshifting (Very annoying)it was replaced by the dealer. The rear window is awful in quality (it scratches easily). Please skip the front spoiler! unless you want to scrape clean every driveway apron. The shift knob will freeze your hand in the morning!and the shifting is not as precise as advertised! specially in cold morn. They should have asked Mazda how to make a smooth shifter (My RX3 would put this one (shifter)to shame!) Aside all this I love my 2K! This car is very raw not refined but that was the same case with the AC Cobras!! Think of it as a Mini Cobra!! Priced paid 32K, New.<br><br>
