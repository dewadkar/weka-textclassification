            I bought my Dodge ram pick-up used because it was reasonable in price.  Mine was very dependable and was excellent for hauling.
The motor was heavy duty enough to handle whatever I threw at it.  
The two drawbacks that I had with this truck was gas mileage and cranking.  I only got about twelve or thirteen miles to the gallon which is somewhat less than comparable models.   It was also difficult to crank at times, especially on cold mornings or days.  The motor was a slant 6 and was a six cylinder.  
Over time the body tended to rust a little but not heavily.
Gauges sometimes were not as accurate as possible.
Overall it was a dependable truck.
