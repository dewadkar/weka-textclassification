            When I test drove my Miata it took me less than a mile to know that this was the car I HAD to have! 

After three years I can tell you I love this car as much as the day I bought it.

If you love to drive, this car will set your spirit free. 

It is very quick, handles like a dream, you can park it anywhere, turn around anywhere, takes just seconds to drop the top and turn heads anywhere you go. I looked up the crash test results on mine and it got 4 stars. It is a very solid little car. We have put nearly 60,000 miles on our with no mechanical problems.

The only thing I don't like (has been changed in the new ones) is the plastic rear window. Also you have to be careful what you keep in the trunk. On the drivers side there is nothing in between the trunk and the exterior quarter panel so loose objects in the trunk can actually cause dents on the exterior of the car. Places that sell custom parts for the Miata carry a protective peice you can put in to prevent that. This car also hold its resale value because it is considered a semi-classic.<br><br>
