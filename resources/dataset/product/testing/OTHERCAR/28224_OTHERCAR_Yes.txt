  I have never loved a car so much!!!!  IT'S GREAT!!!  We have had our 99 Flame Red Durango about four months now, and it is sooooo wonderful!  It handles great, plows right though the snow...what little we have had here in Colorado....I never thought I would own one.
   We are adding on to ours, running boards, lunar visor....ect.  Dodge worked out a great deal with us and I have no regrets buying this SUV.
  The only downside...if there is one...is the gas mileage.  We are only getting about 12-13 in city.  But if that is the only drawback, it's more than worth it to me.<br><br>
