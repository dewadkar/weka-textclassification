            Sometime late this year or in early 2001, the last Aston Martin V-8 will roll out of the ancient works at Newport Pagnell and an era in automaking will come to a quiet end. 

While this should be worthy of a moment's pause no one should really mourn it's passing. Were it not for Ford's purchase of Aston Martin six years ago the last V-8 would have certainly been the last Aston. Even the most devoted fans of the marque recognize that the future of the company lies in the &quot;mass&quot; produced DB-7 series, most praise Ford for keeping the V-8 in production until it's miniscule market was satisfied.

What will pass when the last V-8 is built is the era of handcrafted bespoke cars. Take a look at the picture to your left. Every fender and body panel was made by a craftsman wielding hammers on aluminium sheet. The 5.3 liter V-8 was assembled from scratch by one man and his name is on a plate attached to the right cam cover. Previous owners sometimes requested the work of a favorite engine builder when ordering a new Aston. The Connolly leather for the seats and trim is hand selected and fitted, as is the burled English walnut on the dash. It was noted with pride that the most advanced machinery at the Newport Pagnell factory was the coffee maker.

It is a throwback to the golden era of Duesenberg and Bugatti, and as it was then, what your V-8 will be is limited only by your bank account. Do you want the added power of the Vantage engine but prefer the more understated look of the Coupe body? Would you like the leather to match the seats in your corporate jet? Engine-turned aluminum instead of walnut for the dash? Other companies, most notably Porsche, offer factory customization shops to fulfill the owners desires. But only Aston built every car this way and did it as the great makes of the past had-by the work of an experts hand.   

While the craftsmanship of an Aston V-8 is beyond reproach, a ride in one quickly shows that this is a very old design. This is a massive car for a 2+2 coupe and the look over the long, broad hood creates and impression of a 60's Detroit muscle car even before the big V-8 barks to life. And like the Hemi Cuda's and big-block Chevelle's of old, the Aston is happiest going in a straight line. Weighing almost 4,000 pounds the Aston combines the look and engine of a great sports GT with the heft of a Rolls-Royce or AM General Hummer. When I asked the owner of the car I rode in how it handled he paused for a moment as if asked to recall a terrifying moment from the past. &quot;Good, but this isn't the car I take if I want to play around in the mountains,&quot; he finally said. 

But it was a great car for trips from Scottsdale to Vegas or for driving around town, he added and I couldn't agree more. It might be the best car in the world for those rare people with money, taste and enough security to not have to announce either to everyone they meet. Don't be mistaken, people look and gawked at the Aston but the feeling was radically different from being in a Ferrari or Rolls. I think it's because while the styling of the Aston makes it clear this is something very special, the car has never had the kind of cultural presence to give it that status among the masses. 

That feeling of understated elegance is shared by those fortunate enough to be inside. It's the level of care taken to create everything that separates an Aston V-8 from other great cars. The owner of the car I rode in had traded up from a Mercedes S-class, a wonderful car by any standards, but he said there was something about the wood and leather in the Aston that made the Mercedes seem like a Toyota. Everything was better in some way you might not be able to identify, but taken together the difference was night and day.  

We headed north on Pima Road. Clear of the city he pressed the throttle to the floor and the engine-almost silent in town-released a deep, muscular roar and the desert outside the windows became a blur. Everything that made the Aston came together at that moment, something of a cross between a Ferrari coupe and a Detroit muscle car, with better finish and greater luxury than a Rolls Royce and the understated handsome looks of a Saville Row suit, the Aston V-8 defies convention to create it's own place in the automotive world.

The greatest problem of the V-8's was always it's limited numbers. With only dozens of cars coming out Newport Pagnell in a good year and only a few owners using their cars daily, it was impossible for Aston to build accurate information on bad components. The owners were the research and development department, often discovering that a sensor or other part (most often electronic) failed too soon at the side of a road. Combined with the sparse dealer network (only fourteen in the US) owning an Aston V-8 is not for the unadventurous. (Aside note: The DB-7 Astons, using Ford developed engines and components, have proven to be much more reliable.)

As we drove back to the airport where I worked refueling his airplane and others, I asked what made him choose the Aston over exotics that cost much less? He said he wanted something more exclusive than a Mercedes but not as obvious as a Ferrari, but the biggest reason was his father-a cabinet maker and carpenter for the kind of successful people his son had become. &quot;I saw how important pride and craftsmanship is. When I learned about Aston's in college I knew that's the car I wanted.&quot;

Some stories have a happy ending. That includes the Newport Pagnell factory where his Virage V-8 was made. When the last new V-8 leaves the gates it will remain open to repair and restore these and the older classic Aston Martin's by many of the same hands who created them in the first place. And should you buy a used V-8 after the new ones are no longer available, they will be glad to remake it as you see fit. In a way, they will continue to make time stand still.
