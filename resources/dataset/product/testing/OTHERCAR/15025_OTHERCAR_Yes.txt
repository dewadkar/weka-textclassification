            The Sony Mavica MVC-FD73 doesn't try to bring anything earth-shattering to the digital camera arena--it just makes taking pictures easy by storing them to floppy disk. Add to this its straightforward set of features, and you have a great camera for the beginning user. I loved the idea of saving images to a flopy. I had a Kodak that took great pics but took too long to download . Store clerk advised to buy the Sony FD73. It took such poor pictures that I returned as soon as possible. Traded it for FD83. What can I say? I love it! If you buy Sony step up a little an get at lest the FD83. 
Enjoy
