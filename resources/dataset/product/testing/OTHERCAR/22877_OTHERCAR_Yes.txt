            When it came to cars, I had no idea. It was the first car I've ever bought (well, actually my parents bought it) and I can say it was a good buy and a bad buy. If I were to do it all over again, however, I'd pick something else. At the time, I just needed a car, you know, something to get me to and from college. So I went car shopping with my parents three times to two places. We settled on two choices: 1994 Pontiac or a 1993 Dodge Shadow. I really wanted the Pontiac because it looked good, was roomy, and very cheap (used) for only $2,900. Plus, it only had 68,000 miles on it! However, my dad would not let me get it (for reasons I still cannot fathom). So the next day, we went to one last place that was supposed to be the best place for used cars. So upon going through all the cars there, I test drove and picked out the Dodge Shadow. At first glance, it looked okay, nothing great, but because my parents were willing to let me get it right away, I said yes. A couple of days later, I drove it home and it seemed fine. However, almost a year later, I can tell you that I made the wrong choice.


EXTERIOR: 4
The main problem with this car's exterior is that it looks so stupid. It looks to me like no other car I've ever seen (I don't see much of these cars to begin with). It is boring looking and plain. However, one nice comment I have is the color. I picked out a silver one and it looks pretty cool. The other nice look to it is the rims on the tires, they are pretty cool too. Other than this however, unfortunately, the car is plain, boring, and not very fun to look at. 


INTERIOR: 2
This is by far the worst part of the car: IT IS WAY TOO SMALL! I got the two door model and I can tell you first hand that it is a major pain in the neck to get into the back seat upon entrance. Everyone in the front seat has to get out and the front seats have to be pushed all the way up and even then, it is so tough to get in the back seat. Everything else is just average, all the controls for the heat and stuff work well and easily. Not complaints there. The only problem is the sound system: it's not very powerful. Now, I do not want a system that will blow up the car, but the default speakers in this car are awful and scratchy. The whole radio compartment is very low in location, so reaching for the controls is somewhat of a hassle. 

ENGINE: 5
I believe this car has a 3.0 liter engine, not sure. All I know is it is reliable but not powerful, which is fine with me. I've never been a racing type.

HANDLING: 8
This is the reason I liked the car at first, it handles great. It has a nice smooth ride and is very responsive. I haven't tried it in snow yet, but I know it doesn't have 4-wheel drive so the handling can't be that smooth in the snow. (Then again, what cars ARE good in the snow?) The brakes are pretty good in this car as well.

RIDE: 7
I like this car because it is quiet, as you cannot here the engine or anything and it is a pretty quiet ride. I've taken this car for many joy rides and it is pretty fun to ride in and the only complaints I get are that it is too small. (Unfortunately, that is a recurring theme for this car.)

RELIABILITY: 10
This car is VERY, VERY dependable. I've had it for a year now and there has been virtually no problems, only a battery replacement. This is where this car shines.

VALUE: 6 
A good buy if you are looking for a safe, reliable car, but only if you are willing to sacrifice flash.

THE VERDICT: An average car, but dependable nonetheless.
If you are looking for a cheap, reliable, dependable, and easy car to drive, get this one. If you want a flashy, fun car, look elsewhere, please. You have been warned.

AVERAGE SCORE: 6 out of 10 (slightly above average)
ANDY'S PERSONAL RATING: 5 out of 10 (very average)
