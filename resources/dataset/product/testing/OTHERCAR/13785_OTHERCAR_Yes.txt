            I never really liked the line of Dodge vehicles until they came out with the whole &quot;New Dodge&quot; concept. The &quot;new Dodge&quot; trucks are to say the least Stylish. If youve ever seen a black ram with the sport package youll know what i mean. They simply beautiful trucks. They also provide an extremely quiet ride that feels like a compact more than a truck suspension. Never really had any trouble with mine, of course its only six months old, but i expect this truck to be a long living member of my family. I went ahead and purchased te extended warranty package, but i don't forsee having any trouble with it. This is a good buy.<br><br>
