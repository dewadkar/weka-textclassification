            My sister kept making fun of me for getting this car, telling me that it is no attention-getter, it's too big, it's an old-man's car..etc..  

I agree that it does not necessarily turn heads when you're on the road, but people, it's all about how you feel INSIDE the car that counts!

I used to drive a civic hatchback (honda) and wanted something better.  I test drove many Acura's and other &quot;better&quot; cars, but I'm telling you, although from the outside they looked amazing, inside they were nothing but plastic and you'd have to literally PAY me to believe that I wasn't still in my old honda civic!

The minute I sat in this solara, I felt like I was in a mercedes.  The dash, the power seats, all leather with wood trim (this was an SLE v6 model), and the speed!  Wow..

Driving was so comfortable and this car even uses the same insulating materials that are used in the Lexus car - so it is such a quiet driving experience that you have to be careful - sometimes you don't realize just how fast you are driving!!  

Very smooth on the road, and the feeling you get when you're inside the car, behind the wheel, is just extraordinary.

The car does consume quite a bit of gas, but this truly is a luxury car.

The sound system is excellent, and anybody who sits inside the car with you is truly impressed.

If you're looking for something truly different, I recommend this car - it is well worth the price and I've had no regrets since purchasing it.<br><br>
