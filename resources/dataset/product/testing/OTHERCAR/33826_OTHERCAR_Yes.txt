            I love this camera a lot. I got this as a gift so I am unclear about what it costs, but from what I understand it is about $300. With the battery recharger it costs $400. I happened to have received the battery recharger with it. It is nice. There are 2 different types of batteries, a lithium-ion, and a rechargeable battery. The lithium batteries can't be recharged, so they must be replaced unless you are solely going to use the rechargeable batteries. I have resorted to that because you can take lots of pictures and there is only a 1 1/2 hour recharge time for a fully depleted battery. The features are very nice, you can set all different types of tones for the picture and even rotate them on the screen. They allow a connection between a television and a camera to view pictures on a TV screen. Unless you have a card reader on your camera, you have to use a COM port to import pictures. It takes a long time to import pictures, though. The software package is great and there is good features. They include as a bonus Adobe PhotoDeluxe. Overall, this is a great camera and I would recommend it highly.

This is unrelated, but if anyone happens to know of a place where you can get free prints of digital photos, please email me at brtennis@yahoo.com or write a comment.<br><br>
