            I have long been a believer of the performance of the Toyota Camry.  So have my wife and my in-laws.  In fact, for many years, they have been the proud owners of Toyota Camry sedans. Despite my belief, I never wanted to let them know about it.   For the longest time, I never wanted to get converted.  I defended my affinity for Honda, Chevrolet and GMC vehicles.  Imagine the many discussions and arguments that have resulted from that marriage of the two families. In general, to millions of Americans, the word "Camry" conveys a strong and immediate image.  There is a strong response to this brand wherever you turn.  <b>For its quality, reliability, practicality and value, Toyota Camry has truly defined the American passenger sedan.</b>  It is worth noting that the Camry has earned the title of "best-selling passenger car in America" because it has met the needs of its owners.  

<b>How has Toyota upgraded the well-known Camry?</b>

Based on my experience with the former models and my recent test-drives of the <b>brand new XLE model</b>, I hope to share with you my observations, likes and dislikes.

<i>Eye-popping quality and features</i>

The first thing I noticed about the car is that it looks grand and more stylish.  In fact, its styling, inside and out, appears bolder, smarter than the 2001 model, more upscale and more refined.  A colleague of mine bought the base LE sedan a few months ago.  He handed me the keys one day.  I drove it around our workplace to provide him some feedback.  As tall as he is, he did not have any problems fitting his frame in.  Neither did I!  Then, upon my returns, the comments and appreciation modes got switched on.  On the road, the 6-cylinder sedan is very responsive.  I could easily swerve in and out of lanes especially at lunch time.  Everybody was out to get lunch.

What a huge difference a year makes?  This colleague of mine has wanted to buy a Toyota since last year.  He did not like the 2001 Camry.  He just fell in love with the 2002 Camry.  It has a much crisper handling, improved ride comfort and overall performance.  The sedan's safety and security features are way up there.  Among them, you will find the following:  Automatic programmable power door locks with anti-lock out feature, daytime running lights, with off switch, full-size spare tire, dual front airbags, battery saver feature, side impact door beams and internal trunk-entrapment release handle, child safety seats anchors, illuminated entry system, head restraint, front and rear, front and rear stabilizer bars and many other standard features.

<b>What are the available models?</b>

Having dropped the CE model, the 2002 Toyota Camry is available as a four-door sedan in LE, LE V6, SE, SE V6, XLE and XLE V6 models.  From the base to the upscale models, the differences may lie in the furnishings of the interior, the types of materials used on the door, silver versus special wood, smooth-shifting electronically controlled four-speed automatic overdrive transmission with intelligence (4ECT-i).  Obviously, there is cost attached to the upgrade.  Another feature you will find in the XLE is the sunroof.  The more you want to spend, the more features you'll get.  You can get a navigation system placed in the sedan, for example. 

<b>What are my impressions after the test-drives?</b>

After test-driving the LE model, I decide to find out about the XLE.  I still can't establish the slight difference I sensed in the responsiveness and willingness of the cars.  I had more fun with the XLE though.  Just a tap on the gas pedals provided instant results.  Handling and control are remarkably smooth.  The Toyota Camry features an independent suspension with anti-vibration front and rear subframes.  MacPherson struts secure the front and work with the springs and shocks that have separate upper bearing points on the inner fender.  There was less noise, vibration and harshness.  That's what happened when the noise to the body shell is reduced.  The sedan appears so linear and flushed that it conveys an overall grander look.  From the handles to the many interior features, you will soon realize this has been major improvement in the Camry.  Definitely, it's not anything like the previous models.  Toyota has built on those platforms though!

<b>A run for the money:  What is in it for the competitors?</b>
As I test-drove the 2002 Toyota Camry Sedan, I could not help comparing it to the 2002 Honda Accord.  More precisely, it can be compared to the 2002 Honda limited edition.   In terms of its competitors such as the 2002 Ford Taurus, 2002 Mitsubishi Galant, 2002 Oldsmobile Intrigue and 2002 Mercury Sable, the Camry flies way above.  I have some reservations when comparing it to the Pontiac Grand Prix and 2002 Volkswagen Passat Sedan though!

<b>Space:  Leg, hip and head-room</b>

You don't have to worry about these factors.  Even in the earlier models, you had lots of space.  Imagine for an instant that it comes equipped with a  huge trunk with a cargo capacity of 16 cubic feet.   In the 2002 model, space is agogo!  Just take a look at its user-friendly dashboard and more upscale touch that may remind you of any luxury cars on the market.  


<b>Other equally important observations</b>

The cupholders, the rear-center armrests, the storage with armrest, child safety seats anchors and many more make this car the continuing family sedans.  Take it anywhere you want to.  It will rise to the occasion.

If anything particular, I enjoyed the wide visibility and the driver's seat versatility.  This Camry also takes corners at speed thanks to the rear suspension which is equipped with Chapman struts.  What else do we want in a car?

The 2002 Toyota Camry has it all for your convenience, comfort and safety!

Toyota never stops pleasing its loyal consumers.
