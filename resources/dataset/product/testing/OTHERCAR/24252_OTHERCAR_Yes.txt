             In the past I never really considered myself a truck type of gal, I'm usually one to look for economical and fun cars to drive VS large vehicles that offer mass utility. It wasn't until I experienced driving these types of vehicles a few years back that I didn't count out a full-sized truck or large utility vehicle ever being on my automotive shopping list, especially since I now live on a small ranch and I'm going to be doing a lot of my own landscaping. With my <a href="/content_54917172868">'98 Pontiac Sunfire</a> now sold, I'm on the market for a new/used vehicle, a test drive with a used 1993 2WD Chevrolet C1500 fleetside extended cab was too good to pass up.

For the 1993 model year the Chevrolet C1500 is available  in 4 trim lines and 2 body styles; the famous 454 SS regular cab, 2 door extended cab (tester), 2 door regular cab, and 2 door W/T. Body styles include the fleetside regular cab, the fleetside extended cab(tester), and sportside regular cab. The C1500 is available with a wide array of engine options, my particular truck came with the optional 5.7 liter OHV which pumps out a healthy 210 horsepower. Transmissions include two 5-speed manuals (one being taller geared than the other) and a 4-speed automatic (equipped in tester).


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

 The first thing you notice when you start up the C1500 with the 5.7 liter V8 is its authoritative husky exhaust/ engine note. This typical GM burbly exhaust note is not all show (or should I say sound?), even with only 210 horsepower on par, the C1500 offers plenty of giddy-up from a full stop to 60 MPH. With the C1500's major competitor, the Ford F Series, coming with engines available with comparable horsepower specs for the 1993 model year, they do not seem to match the smooth and effortless <b>acceleration</b> offered from the C1500. My Chevrolet C1500 also came equipped with the admirable (optional) 4-speed automatic transmission which compliments acceleration further; shifts are smooth , precise, and gear holding is excellent. With the early 1990s Ford F-Series/Dodge trucks I did not receive this sort of smooth shifting when equipped with their automatic transmissions. 

  Beginner truck drivers might find the shear girth of the C1500 to be a little overwhelming at first on narrow roads, however this feeling is short lived. While not an auto cross champ by any means, the C1500 holds its own through the twistys; maintaining decent grip and composure through sharp bends in the road. The wheels could be a bit larger, the 15 inchers look and feel a bit small for such a large truck, though this is not a major complaint. Off-road manners are adequate, however like most 2WD RWD trucks the C1500 was not made for rock climbing, instead is more of a river bar rat when it comes to its off-road abilities.

On the freeway is where this truck finds its ultimate home. <b>Cruising</b> at freeway speeds are effortless, making the C1500 a great traveler. Engine noise can get a bit loud at speeds above 70MPH, however not enough so for me to make it a complaint. Unlike some of the the competition of this time period, i.e. the 2WD Ford F-150, the C1500 does an excellent job absorbing bumps in the road, pot holes, and road imperfections in general. Hill climbing is also a attribute offered from the C1500 with the 5.7 liter engine worth talking about.  Despite not having an astonishing amount of power, the C1500 can cruise up almost any steep grade in high gear, only down-shifting into 3rd on the steepest inclines. I was also very impressed with this trucks ability to keep calm when attempting these steep grades; the 1993 C1500 would make a great on-road work truck if you live in mountainous terrain.

One of my major gripes with this truck's performance would be the <b>braking</b> system. Despite new brake pads installed and having 4-wheel ABS as standard equipment, my tester felt as if it was using a 4-wheel drum brake system from the 1950s. I had to use as much pressure as I could to stop this vehicle. I have driven later model C1500s and a few K1500s in my lifetime and never had this problem with the braking system, so my best guess would be that this poor braking was due to a mechanical failure.

The <b>EPA</b> rates the C1500 equipped with the 5.7 liter V8 at around 19 MPG highway. This  means that driving this large truck should not do too much damage to your wallet at the pumps.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

 With so much going for the C1500 pickup it's a shame GM had to make such a dull, uninviting interior.  Unlike Ford, which began using more user friendly instrument panels in their trucks during this time period, GM stuck with the basic, dated, flat instrument panel that not only made for poor ergonomics, but also made for hard to read gauges during the daytime. The plastics are also not up to par for 1993, this cheap material has almost always plagued GM trucks. A test drive with a 2003 Chevy Avalanche proved that some things have not changed much over the years with GM's utility vehicles, such as their plastics, and flat unattractive dash fascias.  My gripes don't end here, the C1500 also has a terrible steering wheel, tacky velour cloth lining along the doors, and a horrible sounding 4-speaker AM/FM radio cassette player.

Seating is also a major gripe. The velour bench seats are not only uncomfortable but also have no head or neck restraints whatsoever. It seems like a large truck would have some sort of whiplash protection; not the case. Room is plentiful up front, but like most 2 door extended cab trucks of the early 1990s the rear is very tight, limited to kids only for long journey comfort.

 Despite a few cubbies in the cabin for storage, the truck bed (like 99.9% of trucks) is where most of your belongings will be hauled.  Measuring around 8ft, the C1500's bed has enough room for just about anything you would need to move, from your weekly groceries, to household furniture, or hauling large amounts of lawn debris/brush. 

<i>Exterior:</i>

  I may not like the interior of the C1500, but I adore the exterior features of this truck. A sense of testosterone emits from this vehicle like no other truck on the market, especially for this time period. Dodge may have the ultimate bold look, but its Chevy's understated yet extremely rugged appearance that has won me over in the looks department.  

<i>Pricing:</i>

 When these trucks were new they retailed at around $18,000. Today, with very good resale most of these C1500 trucks will still be pretty costly, ranging from the 6-9K price range. My tester was being sold for $7,000 with a relatively low 80,000 miles on the odometer; a pretty good value. One should note that if you want the 4-wheel drive K1500 extended cab you are most likely going to have to pay a few grand more.

<i>Final Thoughts:</i>

Buying this truck was very debatable, there are a ton of positives about this truck and a few major negatives. I love the utility this truck offers, but hate the interior accommodation, or lack of. In the end I did not purchase this truck, but it's still not off my shopping list. My final recommendations for this truck goes out to anyone who has a lot of on-road hauling/towing to do that can get past the compromise of the lousy interior design. The C1500 fleetside extended cab is at least worth a test drive if you are in the market for used a full-sized 2WD truck. 

- Happy Car Shopping!
