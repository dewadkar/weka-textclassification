            I've got a Toyota Tacoma and a VW GTI that's been souped-up. After spending the last couple of months working on the GTI (getting repainted after hailstorm) and taking it back to mostly stock, I think I've found a buyer and will be selling it this weekend. I just finished giving it a tune-up last night when I decided to take it out for a spin to see how things were running. I forgot just how fun this car was in its minor-modded stages! It's still got the H&amp;R Springs w Bilstein sports on it, but I've removed the NS rear sway bar and both upper strut tower bars and sold them - wow what a difference. The car is still better than stock, but ALOT looser in the turns, and alot more prone to understeer in the hard corners. I have to say that the cams are sorely missed. The only engine mods it has now are the NS P-Flo intake with custom heat-shield/cold air mod, Garrett v.11 chip, and the TT exhaust. All in all they make it feel peppier than stock, but the 268's really made a difference. 

SO I'm out having fun in it for possibly the last time, driving some local back-road twisties at close to insane speeds, when I reach a gas station just before the interstate on-ramp. I filled it up, cleaned some trash out of the back, and was washing the windshield off when I heard a nice sounding exhaust coming my way. I glanced up and saw a new model Prelude, white with hyper white bulbs/fogs coming up to the light just next to the gas station. I nodded at him and he threw a rev, so I hopped in the GTI and pulled out behind him. There were 2 cars ahead of him, so nothing exciting happened just yet. As the light changed, the 2 cars ahead went straight through the light and the lude (a base model I assume since I didn't see any SH emblems on it) signaled right to get on the on-ramp. Why not? I told myself, since I'm getting rid of the car anyway..... So I signal also, follow him onto the sharp turn of the ramp, where he starts to get on it seeing that I'm following him. I shift to 2nd and hold it there all the way around, keeping pace with him about 2 lenghts back, at around 45mph. The ramp opens up to a straightaway to merge onto the interstate, and he takes off. I floor it in 2nd, run it up to about 68mph (definently miss those cams now), and slam it into 3rd. He's now about 2.5 lengths ahead of me, still in my lane, so I jump to the left lane and floor 3rd. I love the sound of the VR6 growling when floored, and it climbs quickly to 100, putting me next to the Lude. I glance over and see a huge grin on an older guys face in the driver seat, and give him a thumbs up. I keep it floored,shifting to 4th as I'm next to him and begin to pull away. The next exit was coming up, which would send me back towards home, so I keep it floored till around 120 (4th is running out), and signal for the exit. He's now about 3 car lenghts back, but still running strong. I flash my hazards and move into the exit lane. He stayed on it and beeped as he went by, on to race someone else I'm sure. I was all smiles the rest of the way home, thinking about the many great runs I've had in this car, and that was definently one I'll remember.

So now with a new house coming in January and my wife with a bun in the oven (our first), its time to buy something with 4-doors. I've already had my eye on the new S4's, but the thought of baby-puke in a car like that makes me sick. Same story with the upcoming M3's. I dunno, I'm going to hold off on a specific purchase until after I'm in the new house, but we'll see what happens. In the meantime, I'll be driving my dependable (ie. slow)Tacoma pre-runner everyday envying all of the faster cars passing me by. Can't wait to start modding the new sedan!<br><br>
