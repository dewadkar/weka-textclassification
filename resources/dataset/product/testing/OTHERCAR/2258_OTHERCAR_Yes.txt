            BACKGROUND

I have been looking at digital cameras for some time but could never justify the lofty price.  With the exception of low-end cameras with resolution of 640x480, everything seemed to hover at the $400 price range.  Since I wanted to do more than just take pictures for email and web publishing, I really wanted something in the megapixel range as to get close to the resolution of a 35mm camera.

I must say that I love to travel and really enjoy taking lots of pictures when I travel.  I have a Minolta 35mm SLR, a Kodak APS, as well as another point and click 35mm to take quick and easy photos with.  A digital camera would allow me to take snapshots of family, friends, simple scenery etc, without the need to use up film and the associated developing costs.  Considering the amount of photos I take I felt I could justify something in the $200.00 price range.

THE CAMERA

I acquired the PDR-M1 from Ubid.com with a winning bid of $209.00, which seemed to be a good deal after reading several reviews of the camera.  All of the buttons and switches on the camera make it very easy to use.  The power switch is at the top of the camera, and the function wheel is at the top right allowing quick access.  You have a 1.8-inch display for instant gratification.  On the display you will find the menu to set all of the functionality of the camera.  Such as white balance, flash settings, image quality.

Other benefits are being able to remove unwanted pictures saving valuable storage space, video out capabilities so you can show your pictures on a television.  The display allows you to view one pic at a time as well as thumbnails of the pics taken.  You also have a built in 4x zoom for pictures already taken.  This is in addition to the 2x digital zoom white capturing the image.

The fact that the PDR-M1 is compatible with PC's and Macintoshes is a big plus because I own a Mac PowerBook as well as a Compaq desktop system.  This will enable me to travel with the laptop and have immediate access to the picture taken.

OVERALL

If you are looking for a replacement for a traditional camera I do not recommend purchasing a $300+ digital camera.  The Toshiba lacks the ability to capture spontaneous moment due to the amount of time the camera takes to capture and image.  In addition, you have an annoying amount of time between each shot that can take the excitement out of the moment.

The camera does go through standard alkaline batteries quite quickly so the earlier recommendations for using rechargeable batteries is warranted.  Furthermore you will need to invest in a Smartmedia card upgrade in order to store additional images, the 4 Mb card simply is not enough.  A 32-Mb card can be found for a little as $50.00 and will allow for 40 to 300+ images, depending on your desired image resolution.  Other necessities include the optional AC adapter, a carrying case (Case Logic has some nice ones.), a USB reader to quickly download images, and of course a good color printer.

Making up for the camera shortcomings is the superb image quality the camera delivers.  The ability to take a picture and immediately show and friend and then email it to others shortly after is great.  The macro feature allows you to capture images from as little as 4 inches away with amazing detail.

The under $300 price that I have shelled out on the camera and accessories will pay for itself due to the fact that I do not need to pay for film and processing for the many simple pictures that I enjoy taking.  I will still be using my SLR for more creative and pictures that I want to be printed as high quality images.

I do recommend this camera for someone looking to get into a reasonably priced, high quality camera that allows for creativity and a professional looking output.  It is very simple to use, has a user-friendly interface and all of the controls are very well thought out.  As with the other electronic items I have reviewed, you must do a little shopping around to find a price you are willing to pay for the latest technology.  Try looking at places such as Buy.com, Onsale.com and Ubid.com.  I have had lots of success in buying high-end electronics well below their retail value.
