            BMW has finally done it. Many of us sports car enthusiasts are going to be slightly upset with this accomplishment, or at least I will. The 2000 BMW M5 Class Sports Sedan has been give a 4.9 liter V8 producing approximately 400 horsepower. Why? 

I am not sure who BMW was targeting with this car. Since your normal sports car enthusiast will see a sedan style body and turn his head towards the Z3 or Z8 models, maybe BMW was trying to give the family man a way to purchase a family car, with a fire under its hood. Whatever BMW's reason for this monster in disguise, Corvettes, Camaros, Mustangs, even the Viper will see a sports &quot;sedan&quot; trailer closer than it should be!

The interior of this car is what will sell it to the above-average consumer. BMW offers every option available including dual heated seats and an onboard computer that will calculate anything from your distance/time ratio to your the amount of gas your consuming while you drive. Standard leather seats are comfortable, but I don't particularly care for leather in Florida. Also, a manual shift is the only option with this car, so I guess it doesn't offer &quot;everything.&quot;

German engineer costs more and more these days, making the M5 about 70,000 dollars base model. Add on your performance packages and you're talking ridiculous amounts of money. I think that anyone in their right mind would lease this car, not purchase it. (unless you've got all 70K) At least a lease would provide bumper to bumper coverage for the duration and then you can buy a Viper when the lease is up! :-)

I really don't think this car will go where BMW thought it would, since family cars weren't made to carry this kind of power or price tag. Families would be better off spending 23,000 on a new Toyota Camry completely decked out and take the 47,000 extra to pay off other debts.

I am a huge BMW fan in the 3-series and Z-series, but I'm not sure I agree with the idea behind the M5, sorry guys.<br><br>
