            I recently purchased my second Honda Civic 2 Door Hatch back in June 2000 and believe it to be the best vehicle on the city's streets. it is the third Honda Civic I have owned, the first being a 1981 4 Door Civic which was still running well up until June of 2000. These cars live forever! I currently own a 1993 and now a 2000 base model, both from Yellowhead Honda in Edmonton, Alberta and find this car to be economical, spacious, and user friendly! It has great agility in and around the city, and I average 630km to a tank of gas. It is easy to finance, cheap to drive, and still has a sporty look that is easily upgradable depending on the driver's desires. The rear seats fold down and I have moved entire bedroom suites in one load! Anyone looking for an an entry level vehicle should consider none other than the Honda Civic.<br><br>
