            My wife and I have been debating on buying a new vehicle this year.  I myself like the Jeep Wrangler Sport.  She on the other hand like the Volkswagon Beetle.  I'm the outdoors type person with fishing, camping, and riding in the woods.  She like road trips in an economical car.  She wanted something small and cute.  She didn't like the ride of a Jeep.  I wasn't crazy about the extreme compactness of the Beetle. I like a little more room.  After long searching and deliberation we discovered Pontiac's entry in the S.U.V. market.  The 2001 Pontiac Aztek was what we compromised on.  The outside looks are more resembling a car with the traditional Pontiac front end, but also the large rear door and fold down door like a S.U.V.  It comes in a variety of eight different colors which also made for a fun decision.  We did agree on the interior colors right off the bat.  The dark grey was an excellent choice with two children.  I like it for the power it has.  It comes with a 3.4 liter V6 (185 horse power), which is more that enough to pull a bass boat.  It also has an optional camping package which includes a tent and a fitted mattress that fits right in the back.  I also like the stereo options.  It comes standard with an AM/FM/Cassette or an AM/FM/CD player up to a CDX which holds 6 cd right in the dash.  The system has 6 speakers.  In the GT model you can get a control panel for the stereo located in the rear cargo area to keep the party going while tailgating.  My wife thinks that from the front view it looks like a VW Beetle just a little bit flatter in appearance.  She also likes that it handles more like a car than a truck.  Another plus for her is that it comes with four doors instead of the two door Jeep which you have to crawl through to get to the back seat.  So overall I believe that this vehicle will be the answer to both our wants.  My wife has already nicknamed it &quot;The BEEP.&quot;  She said it's our cross between the Beetle and the Jeep.**I am a webtv user. I am unable to form paragraphs.<br><br>
