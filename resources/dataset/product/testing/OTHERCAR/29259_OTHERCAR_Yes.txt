            When I bought this truck, I thought of my new family.  We were about ready to have our first child and my 1994 Cavalier was not going to be big enough to handle all the equipment that is needed for a family always on the go.  I really liked the looks of the newer style Blazers.  We went to the dealer (that we had been warned many times to STAY AWAY FROM!!!) and we test drove it and bought it.  I got a big discount for taking it as is.  A few things needed to be done to it before it was up to being a really good vehicle.  I did those things and it was a great truck, then...it just about fell apart.  The entire exhaust system other than the headers went bad.  The muffler had a huge hole in the bottom of it, the catalytic converter was literally rattling on the inside.  Converters are supposed to have honeycomb shaped ceramic walls on the inside.  "Once heated up are supposed to convert noxious gasses, that are bad for the envirionment, into good gasses".  But this honeycomb was smashed into a billion pieces, literally, not doing its job.  So I spent about $350 on a new muffler system and cat. converter.  Then the engine had begun to have a constant miss.  I changed the spark plugs, the plug wires, and the rotor cap and rotor under the cap, totaling about $75.  It still misses to this day.  I can't figure it out.  And I am not spending another $150 to have a repair shop tell me EXACTLY what I told him that what I thought was wrong!!  Did you catch that?  He quoted me a price that detailed what needed done. 
1. I told him it misses, and I thought it was the spark plugs.  Answer: $95 for a set of plugs and $75 to install them.  What!!!  I paid $25 for a really good set and done it myself.  (note for the diy's: be careful behind that middle plug on the driver's side.  I had to break the old plug off to get it out.  My wrench wouldn't fit behind the steering rod.)
2. I thought the injector was plugged.  By the way, there is ONLY one injector on some of these motors.  Answer: $50 for cleaner and $95 to do it.  No way!
3.And so on.

I may have isolated the problem.  These few years of GM motors are touchy.  I have a 1994 Cavalier and a few years ago I had that same miss on that.  It ended up needing a valve job.  The carbon builds up on one of the valves and doesn't completely close causing a miss.  Cost for me to do it: about $100.  Cost for the auto shop to do it: $500.  Hasn't missed yet.  I've got 170,000 on the motor, and it just starts hard in the winter, and it still gets 30mpg.  I'll update you after I've done a compression test on the Blazer.
