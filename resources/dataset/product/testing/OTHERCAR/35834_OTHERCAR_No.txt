            I own a 94 Saturn SL2. It is an automatic with the full power package. I bought it new, but obviously, this information is more useful to people buying used cars now.

If you are considering buying a SL2/SC2/SW2 from 1994 or earlier, here are some warnings you may want to note:

1) Flaws in the dual-overhead cam larger automatic transmission were one of the reasons the car was redesigned. If you are looking at a stick shift, or an automatic SL or SL1, you may not have a problem. If you are looking at an automatic, and it has the larger engine, reconsider. My casing cracked twice, and had to be replaced. On one of my many tow-truck trips to the dealership, the driver told me that I was his 3rd larger-automatic tranny Saturn in 3 months, and all for cracked transmission casings. So, don't get it.

2) Cruise control module. Visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration web page at http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/ (select &quot;Car Safety - Problems &amp; Issues, then Defect Investigations, choosing just Saturn as the make, with no year or model, to get the most info) to verify that the problem was documented - of course, Saturn made me pay for the repair and never offered to reimburse me for it when the module failure problem was recorded.

3) Sunroof. First warning: Saturn tells outright lies. I live in Connecticut, so the weather isn't that bad in winter, but still, I asked if the sunroof would hold up through New England winters. They assured me there would be no problems. 1.5 years into owning the car, the sunroof failed. They did repair it for free - that time. Then it failed again, this time badly, after about 3.5 years of ownership. The motor and the sunroof frame were almost completely rusted out, and I was told by a mechanically-apt friend that Saturn was to blame, because if the seals had been good and the design sound, the frame and motor should not have rusted out so quickly. Saturn quoted me a price of over $800 to replace it, and I refused. I had Saturn remove the fuse (so the sunroof could not be opened), and force the sunroof shut and taped it. I lived with duct tape and leaks for a year. My floormats started to rot. Then, somehow, the sunroof popped open again, and got stuck - but this time, when I went back to the same dealership - with a 6 ft 5 in boyfriend for company, the price they quoted me to repair it was about $350. Gee, I wonder what happened in a year??? Second warning, specifically for single women: bring a brawny male friend, Saturn is less likely to try to screw you.

4) Alarm system. My alarm system started failing within a year. Rather than having it replaced, Saturn made me drag myself to an alarm place near them (but not near my home or workplace, which dented my income since I was a computer contractor at the time) for repair, which was inadequate and required repeat visits. Also, the alarm place lied to me, telling me that the alarm company was no longer in business; it still is, but the alarm place was no longer carrying that brand and refused to send me somewhere that still was. The alarm finally failed for good a year and a half ago, and Saturn refused to pay for any repair or replacement. I had it removed (at least Saturn was willing to pay for that). Last week, my car was broken into and almost stolen. What really bites about this scenario is that an ex of mine who had a 1993 SC2 with the same alarm system and the same problems got his replaced for free.

Do we see a pattern here??

So, avoid the SL2/SC2/SW2 with larger automatics; avoid getting any options if you are female, because options fail and Saturn will screw you if you try to get what you are entitled to; and avoid Saturn of Wallingford, CT, at all costs.
