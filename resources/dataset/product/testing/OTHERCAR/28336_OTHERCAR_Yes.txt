            I bought this camera because it was small, compact and useable with one hand.  (A plus for a busy Mom who likes to take pictures of family as well as business related items.)  

It was not a &quot;pick up and use&quot; camera as there were many pages of instructions to digest prior to actually using it for the first time.  The instruction manual could be better organized.  Each language should have a complete set of instructions grouped together, not 2 pages of English, then skip over the next four pages of French and Spanish to continue on in English.  Too time consuming!  Also, the instruction manual could be more clear on how to download the pictures from camera to computer.

The photographs I have taken are very sharp and precise and I am very impressed by that.  Other digital cameras I have tried have given me grainy impressions.

I made the mistake of formatting the compactflash card within a program on my computer (after taking my first photographs) and it would never work in the camera again.  I purchased a 32 mb card and so far have had no problems with it, but have not needed to reformat this one yet.
