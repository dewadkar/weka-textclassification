            I've been using the C-2000Z since November for sports photography (I'm a newspaper sports editor) and it's been a huge improvement over our D-600L's (we have two; they're fine for stills and for action shots in bright outdoor light, but inadequate for night football and indoor sports).

I get good results with the 2000Z, even using only the built-in flash (we haven't yet purchased an external flash, but plan to), for basketball, hockey, swimming and wrestling photos. I haven't used it outdoors yet for daylight action shots, but I'm looking forward to doing that in the spring and expect good results based on what I'm getting indoors with flash. The internal flash is great. I get well lit pictures in low light; in fact, the first day we had the camera I took it into our darkroom, shut the door, and took pictures of my hand in complete darkness.

Sample photos are available at http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=178152&amp;a=1304218

I'm not fully happy with the results. I still have to take a lot of shots to get one I really like, because of the slight delay. There isn't a delay when you can pre-focus, but that's hard to do in sports photography. I'd also prefer a quicker recovery time so I wouldn't miss the great picture just after the okay picture. It's an improvement over the 600L, though, in that area.

The resolution is great. We need large original images and we get them with the 2000Z. I also like being able to use the larger capacity Smart Media cards. The camera is under constant demand at the office, where people call it the &quot;good camera.&quot; =)

The size of the camera is an asset as well; I can stick it in my pocket rather than wear it around my neck when I'm out and about. It takes a while to learn all the functions of the camera, but once you study them you find out there are a ton of options as far as resolution, image size, shutter speed, ISO, etc.

For non-sports pictures, the camera is a beaut, and the price has gone way down since it was introduced, so that's a plus as well. But if we were to get the go-ahead to purchase another camera, I'd probably say wait for the 3030Z to be released in May, but only because of the sports photography angle.

On the downside, I just sent our 2000Z to Olympus for repair today, because of a problem with the lens (it was starting to get stuck both in and out). Plus, I'm still a little leery of some of the things people have said about a problem with using external flash and disabling the internal flash, but I don't know enough about it to feel qualified to express an opinion on it. I've learned that the problem was remedied with the introduction of the C-2020Z, which isn't officially an upgrade.<br><br>
