            I had not had a car for three years.  To be honest, I test drove the 1997 Sonata because it was one of the few I could afford.  It was a very quick decision and one of the few times in life when a quick decision paid off.

Within days of buying my car, I took a 1300 mile trip up north.  It did very well on the trip, handled well on the freeway and got good gas mileage.  The Sonata is deceptively big.  Being the mother of two, one in a car seat, I needed a roomy car with the convenience of four doors.  However, being in my twenties. I was still holding on to the dread of driving around in a &quot;family&quot; car.  The Sonata has the look of a midsize car, not to big, but has plenty of room inside.

A couple of weeks after I got my car, I had a problem with the battery.  We called Hyundai and they sent someone to tow it to the dealership that day.  When the mechanic called the next morning, I expected him to tell me how long I was going to be without a car.  Instead, he let me know what the problem had been with my battery, gave me a list of a few other minor things he had fixed, and said I could come and pick up my car whenever I had the chance!  It was only 11:00 the next morning and the car had been towed there after they closed the night before.

I've had my car almost a year now and it is three years old, other then that small problem with the battery and normal wear and tear I have had no problems with it.  I love my car.  It has good pickup, especially for a four cylinder and handles well.<br><br>
