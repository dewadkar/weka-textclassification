                As a veteran Saturn owner, I immediately gravitated towards the LS when I was in for an oil change the other day.  I just had to check this long-awaited, often anticipated new mid-size Saturn.  I must say that my first impression of the vehicle overall is warm, but not hot.  
    The LS series of Saturn continues to embody everything that the GM-Spinoff has always wanted to: simplicity, style, practicality and durability.  She is a tough little number, I'll give her that; and the improved engine and responsiveness is very much welcome.  
    However, I am slightly disappointed in a few features that I will comment on now.  For starters, part of the Saturn mystique is the high-impact plastic that comprised the sides of the SL series of cars.  Apparently now in the LS series, this has been reduced to only door panels.  I am curious why this change has occured and not yet have heard a satisfactory answer.  Additionally, and more importantly, I am a rather tall fella (6'5&quot;); and I bought my original Saturn (a 1997 SL1) not only for the durability and practicality of the overall car, but because it was one of the few cars in the price range that I could actually fit in comfortably!  When I slipped behind the wheel of the LS, I was pleased by the increase in headroom and shoulder room... but lo' and behold my legs were a little crunched.  What's going on here, Saturn?  They seemed to have forgotten that not everyone fits the model of the &quot;average customer.&quot;  I couldn't imagine driving the LS on a long road trip mainly because I would end up having to stop and get out to stretch way too many times for my liking.  
    It is my hope that in future models of the LS, they remember us poor storks who have to duck under doorways.  We like Saturns too, you know!
