            The 2000 Honda Accord LX 4door 5-speed is, perhaps, the best value for the money of any car in its class.  That is a strong statement but one that is backed by months of research into the market and 6 weeks of driving one.

At 6'3', finding a car in this class was also no easy task.  Many were test driven and few passed the comfort test let alone the performance test.  The Accord did!  Not only is it roomy enough for me but all controls are easy to reach and are highly visible.  The bonus is the roominess for backseat passengers and the size of the trunk.  As a hockey Dad, I was also concerned about space for large hockey bags and sticks-again no problem.

In regard to the drive-I cannot imagine a smoother drive, a more responsive approach or a better road hugging vehicle on the market within this class. 

I never thought I would prefer to drive a drive over my Nissan Pathfinder but I now find my Pathfinder staying in the driveway as I hop into the Accord for trips around the city! <br><br>
