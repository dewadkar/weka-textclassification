            I want to put this out there for other people having problems, because I want to know if this car has problems.  My husband and I bought our car in August, and THREE DAYS later it would jerk at high speeds.  We went to the dealership, and they said it was just that we didn't tighten the gas cap enough (Check Engine Light WAS on!!) and that it would go away on its own &quot;eventually&quot;.  It was a Friday afternoon, and they told us leaving it with them at that point would be pointless since all that was wrong was a sensor needed to be reset and their guys wouldn't get to looking at it that day anyways!
   THEN- I am at a friends house up in a mountain town in the boonies and the day after Halloween the car won't start!! All the lights go on and stay on strong, not the battery.  So Roadside Assistance had a tow truck come and tow it to the nearest dealership (a half hour away!)  When I called the dealership the next morning, the service manager asked me what had been wrong with the car!!! He said it started just fine, but they were hooking it up to the computer because the Check Engine Light was on (SINCE THE THIRD DAY WE HAD THE CAR, WHICH MY DEALERSHIP ACTED SO UNCONCERNED ABOUT!!)  Later that day, found out that the &quot;Ignition Coil Pack&quot; had gone bad (he had no explaination as to why this happened on such a new car), and they fixed the recall issue (&quot;Malfunctioning Mass Airflow Sensor&quot;) at that point also.  I was carless, in the boonies, for two days!  (Luckily at a friend's because I have a toddler!)  The best they could offer me was a rental car at half-price, which I took after calling Hyundai Corporate, and the person there suggesting I take it and save receipts for possible reimbursement.  I sent Hyundai that stuff the next day- still haven't heard from them!
   So, does the trouble end here?  Oh no!  We had had the car back for less than two weeks when the Check Engine light started coming on again, this time, intermittently on and off.  So, this was mid-November.  Of course, they did not have any service appointments available for weeks because of holiday closings and existing schedules!  In the following weeks, the car had increasingly less power.  I was on the freeway, with the gas TO THE FLOOR and was only going 40 MPH!!! I couldn't believe it (those of you who have this car know it has a lot of power, and flooring it usually makes it jump into action!)  Luckily, the day it was this bad was the actual day we were taking it in.

So, the verdict this time?  Bad spark plug cables.  (Once again, no explaination as to why this occurred on such a NEW car).  When we got the car back (once again, a whole day later) we not only found that the spark plug cables had been replaced but that once AGAIN they replaced the &quot;Ignition Coil Pack&quot;  That's twice, on the same part, in FOUR months.  If they have to replace that part again in the next year, it falls under our state's lemon law!!!  

The ironic part is, every time I call the dealership (so far has only been to make SERVICE appointments!) they answer with Hello this is Blah blah Hyundai &quot;home of America's Best Warranty&quot; however, the ONE thing that would help in the situation, when the car THEY built goes bad and puts the owner at an inconvenience is a RENTAL CAR!! This is NOT covered under the warranty!!<br><br>
