            Having previously owned a 1984 318i, a 1988 325e and a 1993 325i I thought my next car would be a BMW.  I decided to perhaps make a change so I initially set out to look at 1999 Jetta's.  I like the look of the new body style.  The dealer in my area had nothing that really suited my fancy.  As I was about to move on he showed me a 1999 Passat with everything, less the 2.8 v6.  I had seen them on the road and I was impressed with the look but never really considered purchasing one. I test drove the car and fell in love with it.  The car was solid as a rock and was quite luxurious.  

The next task at hand was to convince my wife.  Her much like myself loved BMW's.  I took her to look at the car.  She liked the look but she wanted to look at BMW's before she considered the Passat.  We test drove a 1995 318i.  This car was in the same price range, had 40,000+ miles as compared to the Passat and possessed half the level of luxury.  We decided to go back to the VW Passatt and let her drive the car.  All her doubts faded after driving the car.  The solid feel, luxury and comfort level won her over.  

We purchased the car 6 months ago with 8,000 miles.  We have racked up over 7,000 problem free miles and have not regretted for a minute our decision.  It's a great car, especially when compared to other German sport sedans.<br><br>
