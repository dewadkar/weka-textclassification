            I am the original owner of my 1994 Saturn SL2 (medium red, like in the picture). I've put 100,000 miles on it over the last 6 years, and I would buy this car again if I had to do it all over. When this one dies, I'm buying an SC2.

The car has required a SINGLE repair in 6 years / 100,000, a minor parts failure that cost $250. Short of that, there literally hasn't been a single thing that has gone wrong with it, and the only costs of ownership have been basic preventative maintenance. The car handles well, brakes well, has plenty of acceleration, and still looks great.

Saturn deserves its reputation for excellent customer service, and I've been always completely satisfied with several Saturn dealerships (sorry - &quot;stores&quot; is what they want you to call them) of brought the car to for preventative maintenance over the years. <br><br>
