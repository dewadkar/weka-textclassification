I started to look at everday SUV's, like the Explorer and Chevy Blazer, coming from owning a BMW all wheel drive (1989 325ix)the little luxury items, leather,cd player,power seats windows are a must, so I was looking at the higher end of these vehicle's. The best way to make a decision in my opinion especially when one is spending 30,000+ on a car is to find a rental company that has what your looking for and rent it. So I rented a Explorer and discovered that it was a little bit small for the stuff I had to carry for work periodacly, well it would fit but I had to move the drivers seat up to where it effected my comfort, liveable on short trips but most of mine are long. So then I started looking to the little bit bigger vehicles. I first rented a Dodge Durango it was nice but for the money it wasn't that good. (Mainly poor fit and finish)Then the Yukon but again the drive was to much truck and again very poor quelity in materials and workmanship. I decided on getting the Expidition but the one at the dealer I was at had a Navigator parked beside it. I test drove it and found the ride amazing, the appearance of the materials right up there with the best of Europe, so I bought it. 

I had the first oil change the other day and must say that the dealer service is better than I have ever had anywhere, then I inadvertly locked the keys in it while it was running, I phoned Ford roadside assistance again the best customer service I have received. Amazing (not trying to brag)considering the cars I and my family have owned, Jaguar,Mercedes, BMW and Porsche, Lincoln has them beat.....The only caveat to buying a Navigator is you need to buy a gas station to go along with it.But then think of the plus side you can always sell your house and move into it.. <br><br>
