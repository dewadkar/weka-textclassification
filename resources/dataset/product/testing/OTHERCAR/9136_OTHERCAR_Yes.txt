            My husband and I bought a 2000 Lincoln Navigator for its looks. After we bought it we figured out how much more it was worth every penny. It is what any sport utility vehicle should be. Not only does it look great, it also runs great. It is sleek, stylish, and very economical. The Navigator has many options that you can choose also. We bought just the base model and we are more than happy with it. While driving a Lincoln Navigator, you will be more comfortable than you would ever believe. Yes the Navigator is a little out of many peoples price range, but if you can get one I would highly recommend it. It rides, drives, and looks great. What more could you ask out of your vehicle than being happy with it.<br><br>
