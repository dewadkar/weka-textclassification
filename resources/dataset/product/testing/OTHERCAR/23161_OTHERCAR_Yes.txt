            I ran into this camera while shopping for a retirement gift for my Uncle. This camera was advertised in Officemax for $149.00 on sale special and it sold out very quickly (15 in one day!!). I went to kitz camera's and they were able to not only match the price but also gave in an in store demo. At first the Panasonic LC20 looks like and feels like a regular 35mm film old style camera. the body is durable and solid apart from the flimsy battery door. It uses 2 Ni-MH rechargeable battery's supplied with the camera as well as a recharger. and doesn't seem to drain that quickly unlike the old 4 cell digital camera's. It uses an SD memory card which from what I've heard is the most popular and is used in handheld computer's (Palm pilot). the controls are easy once you read the manual and get use to the camera. I found the auto mode setting aren't so smart so I experiment with the settings. During the in store demo they took a few photo and downloaded them into a computer. I was very impressed with first the color and then detail of the image. I was use to washed out colors and average detail in my previous digital camera's. I was told that the added feature of the "Leica" lense had made the difference. I was impressed and had decided to buy this camera not only for my Uncle but also for myself. that was 2 weeks ago and I am still very pleased with my decision. With the macro mode I have been taking photo's of flowers and have printed them up on Kodak photo paper and have put them in frames; as well as my family members. The camera comes with a video out port with cable so you can show your just taken photo's on the television screen. the 20 sec. video with sound feature is great for those quick greeting messages a good fun feature. This camera comes complete with software that is easy to use and fun. Overall I highly recommend this camera for a first or second camera   great value!!
