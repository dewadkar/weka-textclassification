            Want to know if you should invest your hard-earned money in a used Miata? By all and any means: YES! I've owned a 1990 for about 18 months and it had only 24,000 miles on it but and have added 45,000 miles to that in no time.  It is fun to drive, handles  beautifully, and most importantly (for me anyway) it is durable and starts every single time no matter what.  Living in Canada we're subject to a lot of rain and snow and the top is leak proof. 4 snow tires are recommended for winter driving and this works even with the Miata being rear wheel drive. A hard top for colder climates is also a great idea as it spares your top from potential cracks and is much warmer. Mazda had the foresight to make all year tops interchangable with any other year - including the new generation!  How often does a car company do something like that?  It just goes to show the exemplary engineering in this thing. Even it's hood is aluminum to save weight. I love this car.
The 1.6L 16-valve DOHC likes the high revs, but remains bullet-proof. However, there is some problem with early 1990 camshaft bolts. They can break, but this is not a sure thing with all 90s - and it is said they break usually after the timing belt has been replaced without caution).  Several owners advance the timing a few degrees for some added power - and doing so is easy because of all the books available just for the Miata, including one by one of the original engineers (he should know). The steering and throttle is almost innate - you swear the computer is hooked up to your brain!  You will seek winding roads without thinking about it and take the longer route everywhere just to drive a little more.  You appreciate this car if you've driven another for a while.  There is a huge international club with a very good website and it can provide many answers to questions. 
Dislikes are few and mostly minor: the trunk is abysmally small due to the spare tire and battery having to go there (an after-market thing can move the tire to under the car); the rear window can get scratched if you don't protect it well; without head-rest speakers the stereo is useless at speed; the heat shield protecting the exhaust manifold can crack and need welding - but this is an inexpensive fix at your local muffler shop and doesn't affect driving - the buzz is just annoying; there has been a problem with some early 1990 models' camshaft bolt breaking, but this usually happens when the timing belt has been installed without caution, it is recommended you have it replaced at a Mazda dealer (and you remind  them about it). As for performance it is all the power you need if you drive it how is intended: let it rev to at least 5500. The chassis can be stiffened extremely easily by bolting on some after market braces (they're cheap).  These braces became standard on 1992 and newer models.  
The car is fun, inexpensive to buy AND maintain, and beautiful - one of those cars whose lines just don't age.
