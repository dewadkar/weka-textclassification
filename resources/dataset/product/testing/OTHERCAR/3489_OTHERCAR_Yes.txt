            We recently purchased a 2001 Subaru Outback.  We plan to use this as our primary car (the older car is a "station car").  Besides everyday use, we take driving trips to Vermont for skiing and a summer vacation to the beaches of Cape Cod.  The four wheel drive feature was very attractive to us for safety and being able to navigate snow in the winter.

I found one flaw in the manufacturing upon delivery.  The latch that holds the back gate closed needed adjusting so the warning light and courtesy lights would go off.

It drives firmly and feels heavy and well built.  You feel safe behind the wheel.  I liked this car versus large SUV's because of the manageable size and good gas mileage.  This is a real consideration now that prices of gas are rising and besides it is better for the environment.  

We bought the car off the lot, so we didn't have complete control of the colors.  The color of the interior fabric is decided by the exterior color and most are delivered with a beige, light interior.  This may get dirty easily if you have children.  I suggest you make sure it has some sort of fabric protector (Scotch Guard).  The colors change occasionally, so make sure you get a tube of touch up paint.  Your car will inevitably get some scratches.


The gas mileage started lower than I expected.  It turned out the tires were under-inflated.  After properly inflating the tires, I am averaging 24 mpg, and better than that on the open road.
