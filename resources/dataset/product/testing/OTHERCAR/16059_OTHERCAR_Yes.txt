            We purchased our Jeep just over one year ago. We bought the Jeep because we have always had a Jeep, and because at the time we had two small children and really liked the safety of an SUV. I had MANY complaints about the 1997 Jeep we had, it had no spunk it was rather loud, bouncy, getting in and out was sometimes a hassle. Before purchasing another Jeep we carefully researched and checked out almost every SUV on the market, test drove &amp; got our kids in and out of them.
 

We finally decided that yet again the Jeep was our choice (or should I say mine LOL). I really liked it, the drive was much improved not nearly as much bouncing, they have improved the pick up, and seems like they made getting in and out a bit easier. I loved that the trunk has a pop open window or a fully opening door. The particular Jeep I have has a leather interior which I absolutely love, if mommies &amp; daddies can afford this option in a car I highly recommend it for it's durability. When we have a spill it is a breeze to wipe it up, and odors do not sit and grow in the seats like they did with our old Jeep.


 The newer Jeeps also come with an optional 10 disc player, and this is another thing that my children absolutely adore. The car really drives nicely, it is very comfortable for long trips. It has power everything in it, power doors, windows, seats ect. We also loved the new earthy colors Chrysler came out with. I do have a few complaints about it, however.


The first one is, I now have a third child and the back seat of the Jeep is REALLY only good for two children. The middle of the seat does not have a three point safety belt, the seat is cut out to be much smaller than the two side seats therefor it is a USELESS space. My infant car seat DOES not fit safely in the middle of the back, it must be placed on either side. That is where the problems begin with me because I cannot put a child in the front, I have to make my 5 year old sit in the middle and then my 8 yr old next to her and the baby is also next to her. We took a 2 hour car ride with the three of them and my husband and I were threatening divorce half way through the trip.


 If we had ONLY been able to put the baby seat in the middle our older children would have been separated and then we would have had sanity. The other thing is that it is a gas guzzler, but we have been used to that since we both have almost always had large cars. So, after one year we are again getting another NEW vehicle. 

One other thing is that about 2 months after we got the car my DH hit a deer with two of us in the car. The car sustained $2,000 worth of damage but were all very safe =)

I would recommend this vehicle to single people, anyone having a new baby or for a family of four. I would not suggest people with more than 2 children purchase this if they are using it as the everyday vehicle for carting the children around.
