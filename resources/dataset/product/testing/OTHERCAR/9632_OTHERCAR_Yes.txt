            I currently own a 1996 Geo(now Chevy)Tracker. My model is a soft top 4X4. The first thing I did when I bought this vehicle was have an alarm system installed. I had previously owned a Tracker that had the soft top cut open. I highly recommend an alarm system, because of this. Otherwise I love this vehicle. It handles well, and is fairly comfortable to drive. I would not recommend that you buy this vehicle if you want a very smooth ride. I think they designed it to &quot;feel&quot; like a 4 wheel drive. Something that I personally like. Another downside is the trunk space. There basically is no trunk in this vehicle. If space is something that you are looking for this vehicle won't provide it. Gas mileage is fairly good. I don't know the exact numbers. The gas tank is very small. I think it only holds about 8-9 gallons, maybe 10. I do have to fill up quite often. This is a great play car. I use it also to commute. It makes a great second family car, or a great starter vehicle for students. Usually very affordable. I purchased mine earlier this year for about $6,900. <br><br>
