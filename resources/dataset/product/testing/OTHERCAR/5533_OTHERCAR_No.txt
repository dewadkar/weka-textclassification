            We bought a one year old white chevy tahoe from a dealer in 1998.  We were impressed with its roominess and got all the bells and whistles - 4WD, running boards, leather interior, tow package.  The only other SUV that we considered was the Chevy Blazer which seemed a bit small and the Dodge Durango which was new at the time and we really wanted a somewhat used vehicle.  We have found that the interior is great - roomy, comfy, accessible.  The mechanics of the car is what has turned us off.  So much so that we probably would never purchase a Chevy again.

The plus side - the interior is fabulous.  It handles well but the entire vehicle does feel &quot;heavy&quot; when driving it.  It accelerates well and is very responsive.  We have had it in snowy Colorado Overpass conditions and it handled well on the ice and snow.  We have a small child and the car seat fits well and tight and I feel like it is a safe vehicle.  There is plenty of leg room in the front and back seats - even for my husband who is 6 foot 7 inches tall.  We have also pulled a three-horse trailer for 1200 mile trips and it did fine.  You have to take corners fairly slowly.

We recently got rear ended in the vehicle at a stop light and it handled SO WELL!  We just got pushed slightly forward with absolutely no damage - not a scratch!.  On the other hand, the car that hit us was split up the center from our tow hitch.  I guess some of that &quot;heaviness&quot; paid off.

The negative side - Within a month we were back at the dealer because just about every routine maintenance item had to be replaced -- filters, plugs, etc. because we were having some problems.  In addition we could not get the back doors to stay open.  These were repaired under warranty.  At 70,000 miles the transmission went out (warranty expired).  This happened before we pulled a horse trailer.  This did seem early to us and when we took it to the transmission shop he said that Tahoes and Suburbans are famous for the transmission going out at about 70-80,000 miles.  We have heard that ten-fold since then from other mechanics.  If we had know this we would not have bought this vehicle because this is quite expensive to fix.  We have met several folks with their second or third transmissions in under 100,000 miles.  

Within a week after that, the rear brake light stopped working and then the brake switch.  Currently the back doors don't shut properly.  

This may seem small but around the door's edges there is a plastic edging trim and there is some sort of glue that Chevy used to keep this plastic bumper trim on. It is awful.  We live in a hot climate so it could be that the heat softens this glue but when you are shutting the doors, etc. you get this black sticky mess all over your hands and it is really hard to get off.  If you don't watch it will get on your clothes as well.  In addition, the Tahoe is a gas hog.

All in all, its a very nice, comfortable, powerful ride.  But be prepared to spend your bucks in gas and expensive repairs, even under 100,000 miles.  Get the longest warranty you can - it will pay off.  <br><br>
