            I was out driving and I came to a stop light.  The light turned green and I started to go, but I was blindsided by a drunk driver.  If the volvo's safety cage wasn't as good as it is, I would have been crushed. It's a great car because I think that it is one of the safest cars on the road.  Also, the car comes moderately priced for a great car.  Also, it substitutes well for an SUV, because it is a sporty car if purchased with the turbo option.  Also, it has a lot of storage space.  The trunk is very large and the back seats can be folded down if you want to increase space even more.  Now that I have kids, i feel very safe in driving them everywhere in this car.  It is a great car, and a great buy.<br><br>
