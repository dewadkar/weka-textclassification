            I was looking for a Digital Camera that was easy to use and had the floppy so I was not limited to so many shots. I was talking to a friend that had the FD73 and I was asking her about it...thought it over and than saw an Add in the paper for the camera...299.00 on sale which was a great buy so I went to Sears as they match prices and they matched it. This camera is great the pictures are clear and sharp and when you have family out of State this is a great way to email pictures to them.
If you are in the market for a good camera be sure to check this one out. There is a camera starter set with an extra battery and carry case,,,cleaning cloth for about 59.99 and thats a must have also.
So if you want some good advice on a good camera go look at the Sony FD73<br><br>
