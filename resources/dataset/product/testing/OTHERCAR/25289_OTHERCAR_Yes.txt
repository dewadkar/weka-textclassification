            I bought this vehicle because of the luxurious interior and the sleek exterior. This vehicle has one of the best interiors in its class. It comes with everything you need and more including onstar, sunroof, and four wheel drive system. The four wheel drive system isn't the best, but it is above average. Inside it is comfortable in the front seat, but not so roomy in the back. The vehicle handles like any other SUV and has sluggish steering and wide turns. I recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs a simple four wheel drive system and superior luxury by one of the top names in automobiles. I guaranty you will be satisfied with this vehicle and the durability of it.  <br><br>
