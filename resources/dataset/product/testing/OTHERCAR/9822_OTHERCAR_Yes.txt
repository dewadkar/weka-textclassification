            I bought my car used, it is a 97... and I love it.  I have been driving it for over a year now, and I haven't had a single problem with it yet.  I am in college, so I have to make somewhat frequent road trips.  Through all of the road trips I have made, it holds up well to any abuse that I can feed it.  I have not had to do any work on it since Iï¿½ve owned it, except love it.  I look great in this car, and I feel great.

I recommend this car for anyone that wants to look good, feel good.  It is not required that you drive hard to own this car, but if you want to, it will certainly let you... it likes it.

I would not recommend this car for someone that needs a family car however.  It is not large in any capacity, way, shape, or form.  This is strictly a play car if you are trying to run a family... I suggest that you get a minivan for the wife, and drive this one on pretty days.

This car will last you a long time, if you like it.  I have fallen in love with it as I imagine you will if you buy one.  There are plenty of aftermarket devices to keep me interested too.  I will have this car for a very long time.  Good luck finding someone to sell you a used one!  You may end up buying new, but no worries, they hold their value  VERY WELL.

You won't be sorry with your purchase!
