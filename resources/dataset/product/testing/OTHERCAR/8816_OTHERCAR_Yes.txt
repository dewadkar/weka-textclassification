            I have had a Honda Accord LX for more than 6 months now. Originally, I wanted a Toyota Camry LE but the financing was not too great. In effect, buying that car would have cost me about two to three thou extra. And the benefits were not that great. In fact having driven the Accord, I think there were no benefits of buying the Camry at all.

I can praise this car for the next three hours but I guess that is not necesarry. Other epinions have done that already. I will just discuss the "issues" I have.

The first is the lack of a CD player. I would have loved to have a Camry for that alone. When I asked for adding a CD player to the Accord, the dealer asked for 700 bucks. I knew I could buy a good CD player for under 300 in Best Buy, so I said no. The problem is that its too much work now. Especially because 99 percent of the time I listen to the Radio (which, in Accord, has less than average acoustics, IMO) and even the included Tape player goes waste. But if I had it, I might have been happier (just to have it).

Second issue is the lack of key-less entry. Same problems. Camry has it standard, Honda dealer asks for too much, I opt out and miss it now.

Lastly, during the small accident I had a few weeks back, my car took <I>a lot</I> of damage. I don't if this is a bad thing or a good thing. It could be called bad because the other car -- a 96 Dodge -- had some scratches and just needed some paint, while mine needed a new hood and a new bumper (a new foam coating on the bumper, I was later told). It can be thought of an a good thing because it has crumple zones (one of the safety features) which makes the hood crumple like a silver foil at the slightest impact. So the alternative might have been a bit of damage to my (and my wife's) neck. In any case, I hated to look at my car till it got fixed. Because it looked so flimsy and fragile.

Just something for the potential buyers to keep in mind. Its a very good car otherwise.
