                 The Camaro, especially the Z28 model, is the best affordable sports car. Granted that there are faster sports car, like the Chevrolet Corvette, but they cost a lot more money. And you don't get a lot more performance for the money. And the Mustang is cheaper, but not by much. For that extra money, you get a lot more performance.

     The handling is something that has to be felt to be believed. As you go around curves, it feels like the Camaro is gripping the road harder. We live in Salt Lake City, Utah, and we have plenty of mountain roads to drive on. When I take my wife for a ride, she wants to go as fast as possible. And that is amazing, because she doesn't usually like going around curves. But in the Camaro, she doesn't feel like she is going to go flying off the road. She feels secure in the turns.

     The performance is great. Taking off from the light, it has enough power to really spin the rear wheels, if that is what you want. However, if you just want to start normally, you will still beat most cars on the road. And when you need the power, it is right under your right foot. With the broad power band, it is even usable in rush-hour traffic. You don't need to shift between gears as often as other less-powered cars.

     The interior is well put together and switches and gauges are within easy view or reach. The bucket seats in the front are very comfortable. However, the seats in the back are not really designed for adults for a long trip. A short trip around town is ok, and kids fit pretty well back there.

     The trunk/hatchback area is fairly spacious. However, the rear seats can be folded down for a lot more carrying room.<br><br>
