              I purchased my camera in June of 2000 and have taken over 1400 photos with it.

  Having a Nikon SLR system with lens and flash for slides and an Olympus stylus epic for prints I was looking for an inexpensive point and shoot digital that would fit in my pocket whether walking, riding my motorcycle or out in the Miata. It had to be able to stand up to hard use and it has.

  Before purchasing I read extensivily on the internet re digital. I knew that this camera was very basic but for email photos and letters it would be ideal. The flash range and available light work as specified.

  My 4yr old granddaughter takes good pictures as have numerous others who have tried it. The convenience, durability, light weight and small size work for me.

 No I have not tried it as a web cam or taken videos, The tripod is useful as is the timer. I like the fact the camera switches off after a minute of non use. The flash works within the limitations specified. The 2 AA batteries last over 100 pictures ( rechargable Nicads are what I use)
I usually carry 2 extra. 

  I was out of action for a hip replacement for nearly 6 wks so fewer photos. I'm sold on digital photography, no dusty negatives or slides to scan, or poor quality prints and will probably purchase a more capable camera soon to supplement the CL18 which has served me so well and has lived up to expectations.

  Great for day trips and simple point and shoot portraits in soft light
