            I bought my car new in 98, and have enjoyed it ever since, so much I have racked up over 100,000 miles on it since I bought it with 25 miles on it.  The car is the Vogue Silver, which is sure to turn heads, because it is rare. The only problem I have had since buying it was the Seat Belts do not like to recoil the drivers side one has been replaced once and still does the same thing.  The belt its self though functions well, and I am sure it will if I am ever in an accident, hopefully not. I recently had the Timing belt changed on it and the mechanic told me that he looked all over and could not find a leak on it anywhere, he told me to keep up with my regular 3000 mile oil changes and I should get another 100,000 with no problem. I also recently changed the clutch and the car drives no different then when I drove it off the lot 2 years ago.  I will continue to stick with Honda products, which stemmed from a CRX I once had and really enjoyed. If only American car makers could only do as good, or at least come close, I don't ever foresee that though...Happy driving.<br><br>
