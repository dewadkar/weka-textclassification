            First off,I am a car salesman.I am in awe of the new 2000 Suburban.I thought the previous models were incredible and saw little room for improvement,but I have had the distinct pleasure of driving the new 2000 BURB and have fallen in love with it.On the outside,it has gotten a more aerodynamic makeover and a rounded front end much like the new Silverado styling.It is certainly one of the sharpest vehicles on the road.The engine has now been changed to the 5.3L V8,which seems,if at all possible, as responsive if not more so than its 5.7L(350) predecessor.The ride remains smooth and almost like a Cadillac if you can believe it.The interior got a limited change,and remains roomy,comfortable and filled with available and standard options.The overall appearance of the vehicle would lead you to believe that the vehicle has become smaller but make no mistake about it....it is as roomy as ever.
If you have a growing family,and need the room,than you have to consider this vehicle.It is a treasure to look at and a surprising tame horse to drive.It may look intimidating,but it is very driver friendly.It has incredible safety features and this year standard 4 wheel disc brakes(ABS).Last year,they were disc in front and drum in the rear.

The negatives are gas mileage,unproven powertrain,and price.
The positives are roominess,styling,power,options,safety,diversity,and ride and handling.
