            <b>Currently I have dropped back one day of work and now only work four days per week. This allows me to concentrate on my passion: Automobiles. Recently I was able to test the new Mercedes CLK class. The Mercedes-Benz CLK Class was released in 1996 and sold very well. People appreciated the design, looks and luxury associated with the marquee and did not mind paying a little extra for a two-door coupe by the Teutonic titan. The latest efforts do not disappoint and prove that Mercedes is certainly heading in the right direction with the �modernisation� process.</b>

The car I tested was the V8 CLK 500 in Elegance guise.


<b>Styling</b>

Mercedes has never really produced ugly looking two doors and the CLK is no exception, looking as elegant as ever. The latest car has been very cleverly styled to appear extremely similar to the extremely expensive Mercedes-Benz CL Class (2 Door S-Class). The new CLK is pillarless (no B-Pillar) offering a very airy interior with uninterrupted views from the drivers seat. There have been various changes with the new car regarding the front-end styling. Gone is the three-pointed star on the bonnet, something which the older car was often criticised for and instead a large Mercedes-Benz badge adorns the grille giving a sportier look. The Peanut shaped headlights are excellent but can be upgraded to Bi-Xenon headlights for AUD$ 3000.

The lowered suspension on the CLK500 contributes to a very nice, low-slung look but can be lowered even further for a small additional cost. The �chunky� look of the old car is gone, this car is all about smooth lines and the side profile is superbly simple in traditional Mercedes-Benz style. The masculine look of the old car seems to have been made more subtle in the newer CLK. The new car with its high sides, finely tapered rear panels and the �CLesque� rear taillights scream elegance. The wheels of the CLK 500 are Alloy, as can be expected with the initial purchase price but can be upgraded rather significantly to AMG style wheels. 17 inch wheels are an additional AUD$ 895 and 19 inch style wheels are an additional $5660. Appropriate adjustments to the suspension are made when these options are selected. AMG Body kits are also available for a very expensive AUD$ 10 000.


<b>Interior and Accommodation</b>

Upon entering the new CLK you will notice if you are used to traditional Mercedes interiors that the CLK is vastly different. It combines traditional Mercedes with technology. Unlike the failed S-Class attempt the CLK actually works and is beautifully harmonious. A sweeping dashboard includes oddly styled circular ventilation vents but they actually work well however I still don�t think they are the standard of the old style Mercedes-Benz. In comparison to my wife�s 300CE it is definitely of an inferior quality but better than most cars. The thickly, leather rimmed steering wheel provides a very comfortable driving position. Typically this can be upgraded to Leather/Wood grain combination for another AUD$ 2000. The CLK 500 incorporates Mercedes-Benz�s COMAND which incorporates DVD Navigation, Audio Sound System, Climate Control, Television and Trip Computer onto a single screen. While I say, �incorporates� it must be stressed that all of these features aren�t standard. The Television is an AUD$ 2600 option. Mercedes claims only 25% of owners choose this option. I know I would.

The CLK is an ergonomic success. Unlike the utter failure of the S-Class the CLK flows. To my shock the climate control system is analogue controlled with digital displays in the COMAND screen. The lighting controls and mirror adjustment is just to the right of the driver. One thing that impressed me was the gauges. The gauges are of the old analogue variety (I honestly can not see the advantage of the totally digital displays) but are perfectly legible. The gauges are encircled in chrome. The thing I liked best about these gauges though was the digital inset. They provide the driver with the exact speed and cruise control information. Fuel levels and Car Coolant Temperature are digital displays in blue, which look odd but strangely enough work very well. A large analogue clock is a nice touch.

The seats of the Mercedes-Benz CLK 500 are excellent, maybe they could do with a little more shoulder support but there is ample room for the larger bodied. I didn�t have the car over a long distance, so I cannot say how they are over long periods but I can safely say that I can predict they will be perfectly adequate. For a Mercedes seat I found them to be rather soft, but providing excellent support. The cushions length was fine and surprisingly a split fold rear seat is provided! Something I like is the individual rear seat, which provide excellent comfort but others may not like the practicality. As usual the seats are electrically adjustable in a variety of ways (I think I counted 14) and have memories for the seat position and exterior mirror position. Optional are heated seats for AUD$ 980.

One thing you can definitely appreciate with this car is all the little extras. The attention to detail is so important and the CLK designers obviously knew this. Examples include electric seatbelt feeders (preventing you from having to reach back to get your seat belt), electric seat and steering wheel which move away from the driver for easy entry/exit and a double hinged centre bin that allows driver and passenger to open on their own side. Outrageously you have to option front seat cup holders, rear seat cup holders are standard. The leather provided was superb quality, soft and thick and the wood grain trim was tasteful in both appearance and application. One thing I can add is the space in the CLK is quite spacious for a coupe. Driver and Passenger legroom is excellent. Space in the rear is a little tight but much better than other 2-doors. The trunk is huge. In an effort to keep weight down no spare tyre is provided, an air compressor and special tyre repairer replace this omission. 

Mercedes has held a long reputation for safety. The CLK 500 comes with dual front airbags and dual driver and passenger door airbags. Rear side airbags are an AUD$ 1070 option. Head restraints are on all seats and front seatbelts are adjustable.


<B>Engine and Handling</b>

The CLK 500 uses Mercedes-Benz�s new highly efficient 5.0 litre engine in V8 configuration. The engine develops a very healthy 306 horse power/225 kilowatts. Acceleration is highly impressive, reaching 0-100km/h in 6 seconds. I did not really test this; you don�t tend to thrash a car on a test drive. In typical German fashion, speed is limited to 250km/h. The engine will not disappoint with a smooth delivery of power and a responsive throttle, the latter being something Benz has long been criticized for not having.

The CLK has ESP, Mercedes� traction control system (Electronic Stability Control), which will keep the car stable, and is a system used in most modern Benzes today. The brakes used on the car are excellent, if requiring a little bit of a push to get going. The 5-Speed Automatic is excellent. The system is adaptive, meaning that it adjusts to your driving style and has a manual mode for sportier driving. The suspension on the car is well suited, providing comfortable touring on all surfaces. It is not however the last thing in sports suspension.


<b>Conclusion</b>

The CLK 500 is superb in being able to combine luxury, serenity and performance. The new car is a very well rounded package, performing even better where the previous model struggled. The appearance of the car, cleverly styled to look like it is $100 000 more expensive car is sure to sway some people to buying it alone. Equipment levels are excellent for a Benz, even if a long list of options is available.

The initial purchase cost is high, but you will be provided with an automobile you can appreciate, love and admire. It is that sort of car. It does nothing wrong, but does many things very well meaning that it is one of those cars you just can�t stop driving. If you can live with having only 4 seats and two doors, like the Mercedes name and want a car that won�t date, then the CLK 500 is for you.
