            I currently drive a 98 S-10 Blazer, but my best friend drives a 98 S-10. We work on the truck daily, customizing it.  Although it's performance enhanced, and performs far better than stock S-10s, I feel that the Chevy S-10 is a great mini truck.  IT offers a lot of feature on the truck and the looks can't be beat.  The truck looks great dropped or raised.  The fuel economy is great for a small truck with a V-6.  The truck is fast for its size and the interior is very comfortable, even for the person sitting in the cab area.  The ride is very smooth and turning is not too shabby as well.  The Vortec V-6 engine is very reliable and powerful. Both of us have not had any problems with them since we got our trucks.  There are a lot of performance products to go on the engine, which can give you tons more horses. I currently have about 275 and he has close to 300.  Both truck haul ass on the street.  The truck is great for a teenager, and even works great for hauling around stuff. I would only recommend the extended cab because the regular is too small on the inside, you don't even have much room to recline your seat.  But overall I think the S-10 is the best small truck on the market right now.<br><br>
