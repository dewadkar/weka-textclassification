            I love/hate my Kia!  My Kia is a great vehicle when it works, and is not in the repair shop.  I have been reading comments on this site and on Edmunds site.  I have been having the same problems as everyone else--although I am thankful some of my &quot;minor&quot; problems are just minor!

Recalls--I think three or four times already!  One recall was 4WD, (which I forgot about).  Well, I tried 4WD for the first time this season--didn't work.  After waiting 2 weeks for parts, finally got it fixed but was told that it will probably go out again--or get recalled, Kia is trying to fix the problem.

My battery went out also, after the first year.  I have black dust constantly on my front tires.  I have had the back latch (by tire) fixed three or four times.  Door locks, windows, side mirrors did not work, fixed under warranty, now side mirrors don't move.  I can move the drive shift lever to N while driving (it happened once, accidently).  

FOR SALE:  KIA!!!!  <br><br>
