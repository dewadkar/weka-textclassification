            For my 16th birthday, I was handed down an '88 Dodge Ram D150 LE. Though the truck had tons of miles (at least 300,000) it still ran, pulled, and drove nicely. The only thing that isn't great that I've noticed are the transmissions, this truck was used as it was meant, to pull, and it's on it's 7th transmission. The only other thing that might concern anyone is the lack of aftermarket parts and accessories for the pre '94 Dodge Rams. Anything you do has to be done custom, at a huge expense.

The interior is comfortable for a truck, with good visibility all the way around. Avoid models with power windows and door locks, as they are just more things that can go wrong. If you plan on pulling, get the Manual transmission, or count on a lot of costly repairs.
