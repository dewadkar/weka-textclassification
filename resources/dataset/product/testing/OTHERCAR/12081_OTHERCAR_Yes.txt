            I used to sell the Suzuki Grand Vitara and I can tell you I was always happy to see one drive off our lot.  I knew my customer would have a good vehicle.  I knew they were happy with the price and I knew I would never hear anything back about my customer having troubles with their new vehicle.  

The Suzuki Grand Vitara is a bold new addition to Suzuki's sport-utility line.  It was introduced in the 99 model year and took the country and the world by storm.  The Grand Vitara comes standard with a V6 engine and on a vehicle that size, that's a lot of power!  You can get them in four types... the JX, the JX+, the JLX and the JLX+.  The difference?  The JX series is the two-wheel drive model.  The JLX series is the four-wheel drive model.  The + denotes ABS, and custom wheels.  All models come standard with AC, power everything, and am/fm cassette.

When driving the Grand Vitara (2-wheel or 4-wheel mode) you will notice that its suspension is a little stiff.  This is because this vehicle is made to be taken off-road.  It has a stiffer suspension for those tough hills, and roads.  For someone that will use the vehicle as their primary mode of transport say to and from work, they may find the ride a little stiff compared to most passenger vehicles.  You may also note that even though the suspension is stiff, the handling is very smooth.  Tight corners and big bumps are no problem when driving.  You'll also notice very little body roll which is a big concern for sport utility drivers.

If you have a large family, I hope that all the rest of them have short legs.  The one major downfall with the Grand Vitara is the rear leg room.  Head room is superb!  I have had many a 6 foot tall or taller gentleman find the ride very comfortable (head-wise) in the back of the Grand Vitara but they all said the same thing about the leg room..... why is there so little?  Myself, who happens to be 5' 8&quot;, did find the rear leg room lacking.  

Compared to most other SUV's in it's class the Grand Vitara excels.  It comes standard V6, AC and power everything.  Most other SUV's in it's class are only four cylinders and strip models, no AC, no power, etc.  

If you are considering this vehicle than I would have to say it is a good choice.  Compare it to the Kia Sportage, the Chevy Tracker and the Honda CR-V and the Toyota Rav4 and you will find that you will come back to the Grand Vitara for price, value and quality.  <br><br>
