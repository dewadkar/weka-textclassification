            I am now driving my third new Toyota Corolla.  I leased my first Corolla in 1995.  Since then, I have leased a new one every two or three years.  This is the best car I have ever driven.  I have never had any problems with any of the cars.  The price is much less than a Camry, but the Corolla is not that much less in quality.   I have driven both, and I don't see much difference in the quality.  <br>Driving this car is a wonderful experience.  The drive is so smooth.  The car is large enough to feel safe, but small enough to drive and park easily.  <br><br>I love everything about this car.  I can't think of anything I hate.  This is a great car for everyone.  I would recommend it especially to teenagers going off to college.  It is a car that is going to be very reliable.  You won't have to worry about breaking down.  <br><br>All in all, I think a Toyota of any kind is a great investment, but a Corolla is an especially good choice.  For the price and reliability, you can't get a better car.<br><br><br>
