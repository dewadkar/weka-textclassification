            I bought this car about a year ago for my daughter (17 years old) to drive to and from school and her various and many extra curricular activities. That way, neither I nor my wife would have to take time off from work to give her rides to the various events. I bought the car used from a local car dealer. I took it to my mechanic prior to the sale and had him check it over. He gave it an ok and so I bought it. It has been a very dependable car for her. And she loves driving it and the freedom it gives her. It has a 5 speed manual transmission and she likes the stick over the automatic (smart girl).

The only problem I have had with it in almost a year of driving is that the alternator went out a couple of weeks ago. It gets good gas mileage although I'm not sure how much because my daughter doesn't keep track of the miles driven. But I know that she only needs to fill it up about every other week. Because the model that we have only has 2 doors, it is a little bit difficult getting in and out of the back seats. However, that doesn't seem to bother her school friends (ah, the advantage of youth).

Because it is Nissan's smallest car, it doesn't have a lot of acceleration. But that is fine with me (I don't drive it a lot). Definitely safer for my daughter.<br><br>
