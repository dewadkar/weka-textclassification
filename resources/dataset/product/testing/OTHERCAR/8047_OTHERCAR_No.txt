               Saturns are great little cars.  They are speedy and efficent. I really enjoy having a Saturn, it was worth every penny I paid for it.  However there are several problems that I've had with them.  
   First I'll start with the good stuff....    It's a sleek looking car, not an eyesore like some.  It is also very efficent.  It's very reliable, as I rarly have problems with it.  And Saturns are very easy to Drive.
   Now that seems like a little, compared to some of the things wrong with it, however, it's a great car and it's good and bad points even out in my head.
   First of all...  Saturns are expensive in my opinion compared to other cars.  However they are not Too expensive, they are well worth the price that you pay for them.
   Another problem that Saturns have is that they're small.  Which can be a problem from time to time, as you can't fit as much as you'd like into them.  
  Saturns are also very low on the ground, which in and of itself is two problems.  First of all, at night, the lights from every other car is just about at your eye level, which can become very annoying.  
  Another very bad thing about it being low is that it gets stuck in the snow alot.  Even a small snowpile is enough to get stuck in.  
  Being small and without 4 wheel drive it is very good in the snow, easy to control, with it's anti lock breaks very very helpful and comforting.

  All in all, If you have the money, and don't live in a snowy area..  get a saturn.  They are a great value and well worth it, even with it's several problems.  <br><br>
