            I like my 1997 Astro Van because it truly is a MiniVan not a front wheel drive glorified station wagon.  It replaced my wife's 1987 Chevy Truck. It's built like a truck and you can work it like a truck.  I have hauled cars on trailers behind it on 3 occasions and it never felt funny or balked at the load.

I am disappointed that I had to replace the factory shock absorbers at around 50K miles and that the power window motors are failing when it is less than 3 years old.  I also replaced both front idler arms at 70K miles.  I also wish the front foot wells had more space in them.

With all the seats in place I can fit 7 adults in comfort.  If I remove all the back seats I can load plywood inside the Astro and close the back doors...some trucks don't have an 8 foot bed.

It's only been to the shop for small things that I didn't feel like fixing myself while it was still under warranty...otherwise I have done all the work myself.<br><br>
