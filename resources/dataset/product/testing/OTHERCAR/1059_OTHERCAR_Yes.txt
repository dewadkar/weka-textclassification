            I am the proud owner of a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.  I fell in love with the fine work of art the day that I saw it on the showroom floor.  I have no big complaints about the stunning SUV, well who could.  It has been through alot, from wrecks, snow, deep in mud, and just road driving.  And never has ever given me any trouble. I love the way the 5.2 liter engine gives me all the power that I need, wether its passing a slow driver on the road or towing a trailer with all of my stuff for college.  The only thing that I dislike about this automobile is the gas milage.  As a college student the money sometimes is kinda tight and at 19 miles to the gallon on the highway its kinda ruff on the tank.  But it is well worth the money for the ride you get, no cramped legs in the back and just smooth sailing all the way to your destination.  In town or on the highway its the best you can get.<br><br>
