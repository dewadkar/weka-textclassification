            My first thought when I saw the Pontiac Aztec was something close to, "What kind of weirdo drives that?!"  Since those days, I have become that weirdo. It is actually my wife's car, but has become our main mode of transportation and I have to admit that I enjoy the opportunities I get to drive it. 

I almost laughed when my wife showed some interest in the Aztec.  I thought she was joking because she is the more conservative of the two of us.  However, she had done some research and she quickly got past the funky look.  It took longer for me to come to the same conclusions, but I will admit that it really does grow on you.  After deciding that we could look at it as a real possibility, my thought was that if we were going to get a crazy looking car like this, we might as well get it in red or yellow and draw attention to us.  But those were the last two colors my wife wanted.  I take that back - the baby-poop green was the worst!  After looking at several and seeing them in person, as opposed to the website or on brochures, I sided with her and favored the more conservative colors as well.  They tend not to be so harsh and the massive plastic paneling blends in better so as not to announce just how contemporary it actually is.

Getting past the look of the thing, our test driving proved to be a very positive experience.  My wife liked the handling, which was touted to be more car-like than other SUVs by the sales rep and he was right for once.  She also liked the fact that it rides high - maybe not as high as some of the behemoths on the road, but you do sit higher than your average car.  Her comment on the height is that she doesn't have to worry about stepping up into it, so she can comfortably wear skirts and dresses without worrying about hiking them up to mid-thigh to get in and out as she does in my Jeep Wrangler.  So she loves that aspect.  The V6 has nice acceleration and even at speeds approaching illegal, it handles extremely well.

Most of the features are great.  I really like the Heads Up Display, the steering wheel control of the radio, the extreme flexible seat settings, the cargo tray, and the dual temperature control.  And those are just my favorites!  I also like the door lock reminder, a chime that lets you know the doors will be locking so make sure you have your keys in hand; the automatic headlights that will shut off automatically after ten minutes even if you have the controls set to manual; and the remote for the rear hatch. The dealer threw in the camping package, which we cannot wait to use, but have not yet had the chance, other than to set it up in the driveway and have the neighbors wonder what we were doing!  The nets and cover in the back are also useful to provide compartmentalization and privacy respectfully.  The cooler seems a bit much to me as we only use it to store CDs, but an upcoming vacation with my neice (5) and nephew (3) might see a need for it. The side door pouches are useless so far as the nets on the doors seem to hold everything just fine.  The tailgaiting is okay - we like the radio controls in the back, but without a stadium seat of some kind that provides back support, a movie at the drive-in is still a front seat deal.  It was also important to my wife that she have a sun roof, which meant that the center ceiling console with the availability of On Star disappeared.  It apparently is one or the other.  One last thing... I'm a big guy - 6'3", 275, and I can ride in the front comfortably and in the back if we don't go too far.  We had to get leather seats because the cloth seats in the front pushed in at my shoulders too much for my comfort, but in leather, it is very comfortable.  I haven't been able to sleep in a car for years, but this one will likely change that on a road trip.

Overall, we are extremely pleased with our purchase.  Having it in the driveway, it no longer looks weird to me, but then again, having a beer belly doesn't make me think I'm fat yet either!  The darker colors take a lot of the funkiness away - we got black and the whole back in blends together moreso than some of the brighter colors.  My wife is ecstatic about it and I am really happy we went with it.  It will be a fantastic car as we look forward to the coming of children, which is why we had to get a new car in the first place!
