Original Soccer Mom, leaving Nissan Quest and looking for a sedan for transporting 2 to 3 teens and the right size for a soon to be 16 year old driver.

Grew up in the imported car business, learned to drive in an Alfa Romeo GTV, so handling and acceleration are important to me.

Knew the car had to have a 6 cylinder 24 valve engine, with good low end torque, and 4 speed automatic transmission with overdrive.  That immediately threw many cars out of the running, like Honda and Saturn.

Wanted rack and pinion steeing and MacPherson strut suspension for handling.  Well that left the Camry, in the under $25,000 category.  Maxima was a possiblity, but I was leasing and the residual on the Maxima, made the monthly lease payment ridiculous.  

Also, check cost of insurance.  Maxima was an extra $500/year to insure, and the lease payment was an extra $100/month because of the residual.  

Research done, now it was time to drive the potential vehicles.  Have a test drive route I like to use, that tests visibility in corners, and body roll and acceleration and braking.  Maxima failed the test drive and IT DOESN'T HAVE REAR CUP HOLDERS!  Camry was very hot to drive, salesman actually survived the ordeal.  Leased the vehicle from Maita Toyota in Sacramento -- Al Palmer was the awesome sales associate -- straight forward, no baloney.
