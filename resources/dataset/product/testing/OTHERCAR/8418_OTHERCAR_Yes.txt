            I've had this camera for over a year and a half now.  Got it when the camera was $1200 and was one of the best digital camera's out. I've used this camera for many things: family/friend pics, school work, web pages, and even helped my dad make a catalog with it.  Here are some of the key aspects of the camera that might help out some buyers.

Good: 
1.) Takes great pics in correct lighting. 1280 X 1024 Res.  
2.) Very easy to use. Straight out the box, point and click. 
3.) Auto-focus, SLR.

Bad:
1.) Very hard to get the camera to focus when there is dim lighting. And when it does, it doesn't take a very clear picture.
2.) Battery-life.  This camera eats up batteries like crazy. With 4 new batteries, I can take around 23-35 pictures. Depending on how much I just the zoom and at what resolution.
3.) Connects to the computer through parallel port.  Very slow transfer of pictures from camera to computer.
