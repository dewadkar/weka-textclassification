            WOW!  What a car!  What it lacks in styling (the front), it more than makes up for on the road.  Who knew there could be such a good thing that costs less than $30k.  This car is a rocket on wheels.  Great engine, great suspension, excellent balance, AWD, nice interior, firm chassis (very little body flex), three-point steering wheel, racing pedals, perfect bucket seats.

This car is so much fun to drive that sometimes I just go out to drive now.  You can take a 270 degree turn at 40 and you'll stick the ground like you're on rails.  No body lean, no slippage and the seats will keep you in place.

The stiff long throw clutch and short throw gearbox make a good combination for heart pounding acceleration but makes for a tedious and tiring process in stop-and-go traffic.  

That said, this car is not for everybody.  The seats could be a squeeze for larger people.  Sunroof/Moonroof is not an option due to the required rigidity of the body (a rally standard).  

I could go on...  for a long time...

One more thing. If you go for a test drive, wait for a red light.  When it turns green, drop the clutch at 5 grand and feel your back being pressed against the seat and watch world go by.
