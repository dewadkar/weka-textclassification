            We bought this vehicle because we thought it was beautiful, powerful, classy, etc.  Everything we thought we could want in a luxury car.  Well, what we got was a big pain in the neck.  It has had numerous problems from the get go.  

First, the CD player stopped working.  We took it to the dealer and 2 weeks later it stopped working again.  A new stereo was ordered and installed and it also stopped working about 6 months later.  

Then the driver's side window failed.  When the dealer fixed that, they didn't re-connect the air conditioning hose back to the door vent so, the cold air was blowing directly onto the interior chrome door handle.   Another trip to the dealer for that.  

Next, the transmission started &quot;clunking&quot; when shifted into any gear.  We took the vehicle to the dealer four (4) different times and we were told that the problem was fixed but, as soon as WE started the car up it did the same thing again.  Finally, after the dealer kept the car for 5 weeks they decided that the transmission needed to be replaced.  Even with the new transmission, we still have to &quot;slam&quot; the gear shift all the way forward with the butt of our hand in order to engage the sensor so that the engine will start.  We have had this adjusted numerous times and it's still not right.  This problem also affects the operation of the &quot;back-up&quot; lights when the car is in reverse.  I found out the hard way that my lights were not working when I was backing out of a parking space at the grocery store.  The sensor is off just enough so that when the car is &quot;in&quot; reverse the lights don't work but when sliding the shifter on the way to reverse the lights do flash on for a split second.  Again, after numerous adjustments this is still a problem. 

And here's the most disturbing thing that this vehicle does.  When you get in the car, all of the electrical devices (radio, turn signals, check engine light, etc.) turn on even before you put the key in the ignition.  When driving down the road, the turn signal noise will come on even though the turn signal has not been activated.  Also while driving, it is not uncommon for the &quot;check engine soon&quot; light to come on, the dinging noise that signals that a door is open to come on (even though the doors are all closed) and the &quot;change oil now&quot; message to come up on the computer even though the oil was just changed.  I could go on all day.  All of these things were looked at by the dealer and no explanation could be given nor could the problems be resolved.  We know another couple that has had all of these same problems with their 1995 Aurora so, it's not just our car.  My explanation, the freaking car is POSSESSED and it knows that we HATE it!!!!

So, what we have is a 1995 Oldsmobile Aurora with 81,000 miles on it and it's a gigantic piece of JUNK!!  I refuse to drive the thing and will NEVER allow my children in it.  We have tried to sell it but nobody wants it.  We can't even give it away!  I'd have to say that my 1988 Hyundai Excel was a far superior car to this one and it was a third of the price.

Shame on Oldsmobile for making such a crummy car!       <br><br>
