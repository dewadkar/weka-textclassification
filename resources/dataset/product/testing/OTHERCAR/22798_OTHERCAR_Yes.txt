            I was looking for a good, reliable and inexpensive car for my two children, a 16 year old daughter and 19 year old son in university. The 1.9% leasing is what initially brought me to our local Hyundai dealer. I needed a vehicle that was going to provide reliability and affordability and still have some appeal for the kids. We chose a Hyundai Accent "Sport" equipped with body styling package, sunroof, CD player, five speed transmission and alloy wheels. Shortly after it's purchase I installed a set of 16" alloy rims and low profile tires. Dry weather handling increase considerably although the combination proved disasterous for winter driving. Switching back to factory wheels and tires solved the problems and the car was very managable and predictable even for novice drivers.

Four years and 45,000km later, the Accent has proven to be one of the best auto purchases I have made.  The car has been absolutely flawless in operation.  Other than scheduled maintenance, the only money spent on this vehicle was $29.00 to replace a fog lamp bulb.

The engine still performs as it did the day it was delivered and still gets 27/35 mpg (thats imperial gallons).

The auto was involved in a major collision when a brain dead driver made a 'U' turn in front of my son. Driver restraint system (no air bags) held his 240 lbs in place and he suffered no injury. Damage to the vehicle was extensive but did not infringe upon the driver/passenger compartment. The other car was written off. Although damage exceeded $6,000.00 it was repaired. Had the vehicle been equipped with air bags, the additional cost of repairing them would have resulted in a write-off.

Both the kids now have their own vehicles and dear old Dad is stuck with the lease.  It sat for a month or so, and when the price of gas went through the roof I started driving it opposed to my gas guzzling GMC Z71 4x4.  What a skit. This little car, even though underpowered for my taste, was fun to drive.  Now the 4x4 sits in the driveway collecting dust.

The car has remained relatively tight and free from rattles or suspension noise.  The cloth interior has withstood the rigors of time and kids and looks new. The car as delivered was provided with dealer clear coat and still looks great with just a wash.

All in all, the car provided everything it was purchased to do and then some. It provided safe, reliable and affordable transportation for 3 1/2 years (lease is up in Apr. 2002). A GREAT LITTLE CAR.
