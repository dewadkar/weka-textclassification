            We bought this 1991 used in 1995.  We've had it going on 5 years now (which makes it 9 years old).  It has over 110,000 miles on it and it still going strong.  It has been driven from NM to AL and back 3 times, from AL to NY twice,from FL to AL once and from NM to GA once.  It now goes from GA to AL (130 miles each way) very often and has never given us any trouble. Not a thing has gone wrong with the car since I owned it.  The only con is that the plastic parts are cheap.  I have had to replace the door handles (on the inside) on all four doors and the window crank on the drivers door.  If the newer models are made the same way as in 1991, you can't go wrong for the price.  What a GREAT car.  <br><br>
