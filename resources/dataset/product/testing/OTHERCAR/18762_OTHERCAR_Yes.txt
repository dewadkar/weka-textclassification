            OK.  I really think that those who are complaining about this watch are expecting too much from a new technolegy.  I have used this camera.  I have one.  I also have the PC link kit (please note usually sold seperately an extra $50).

The camera watch (WQV1)is COOL!  The pictures are not the quality of a regular digital camera that you are able to purchase...but come on, what can you expect from a watch?  This is the only thing like this on the market, and really neat for someone who likes gadgets.

The software and pc link infared port (serial port) is usually sold seperately (this depends on where you buy it).  The package is usually going to run you about $50.  Please note, PC users only on the software, the MAC software is due out in 2001.

The first time I got the watch out, I thought it was a little too big, and looks a little flimsy.  I thought, yeah right like this is gonna work.  It did.  Tips:  the brighter lighting you're in and the closer you are to whatever you are taking the picture of, the clearer the image that you get.

When I started taking pictures with the watch, I was quite impressed.  You cannot expect 3.11 megapixels out of a watch, at least not yet.  This is a neat gadget, and a high quality item..great gift!

Also, another advantage to the watch is that it &quot;shuts off&quot; when you are not using it.  When laying on a table/desk for a long period of time it kicks into &quot;energy saving mode&quot; to preserve your battery.  The battery by the way is pretty easy to change.

All in all...not to replace your regular camera.  But a really cool &quot;grown up toy&quot;.<br><br>
