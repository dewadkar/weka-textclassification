            I originally purchased three of these for family and friends and paid about $80 /each for them new.  They arrived and they all worked as specified.  It is moderately easy for a beginner to use, as it is compatible with TWAIN.  The gotcha on this great deal for a 640x480 flash smart card media digital camera is that it CHEWS up batteries.  If everyone had one of these, Duracell and Energizer would not keep up.  You can shoot the camera full and dump it to the computer and you have just toasted 4 AA batteries...just like that.  The first accessory I bought for everyone was a NiMH battery charger with 4 batteries.  Some bought an extra four so they could get a good two full runs with this camera.  The picture quality of this camera is average.  It has a built in flash, but you really must be within 4 feet for it to make a difference.  The LCD screen on the back is active matrix and allows live viewing of the composition as well as a (neeto) nine-picture mode that allows you to delete and review efficiently.  The LCD has an off button.  Use it or you may not finish your &quot;roll&quot; on one set of batteries.  The camera is a bit larger than the rest of the pack probably because it has 4 AA batteries, a flash media card, an NTSC output for live video on a TV, and an LCD.  I would have bought one for myself had they made it large enough to handle 6 AA batteries thereby extending useful time.   All in all, I would recommend this camera for the novice or the person who just needs a few casual snapshots.  I certainly would not may more than $100 for it though.    <br><br>
