            I had never owned a new car, so it was a big decision.  My fiancee and I  had been test driving blazers at the time, when we noticed a lease promotion VW was offering.  We stopped by for a test drive and the rest is history. 
 I have a 1995 VW Jetta III Celebration Edition which was a special anniversary model put out that year.  It is the 4 Cylinder model 2.0 Liter engine and I get really good gas mileage, about 400 miles to a tank-when I do a lot of freeway driving and about 350 miles to the tank when I do city driving which is still good.  The body and the paint have held up well going on five years old.  The warranty offered cant be beat 10 years-100,000 miles.  We have not had any major repairs done at all, its still going like it did new.  The interior space is comfortable for 4, a little cramped with 5 but still do-able.I didnt get power windows or the seat warmers, but I cant say that I miss having them.  I love having the sun-roof and that part is the only thing I can say we have had problems with.  A portion of the mechanical parts in the sunroof are made of plastic and with time, being used and weathering they have worn out and had to be fixed. The trunk space cant be beat, I can fit 2 strollers and still have plenty of room to spare.  For the price its a really good buy.  I would buy one again.<br><br>
