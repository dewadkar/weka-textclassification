            Even before becoming a GM employee, I loved GM cars and always thought that GM cars were superior in quality to the other choices.  I had purchased a 1989 Corsica before and it was really good to me.  I had no car problems and no car repairs on the '89.  I wanted to update my vehicle and I loved the style and for my family of 4 it was comfortable for us to use as a family car.  I purchased the 1991 and still have it today. The Corsica handles very well on the road and is a fast car.   

This 1991 Corsica have been through some pretty rough times with our family.  Every one in my family have driven this car.  My husband, who is over six feet tall have driven this car.  My daughter drove it during high school, she is now in her fourth year of college.  My son drove this car during high school.  He is just finished his freshman year of college. My mother, brothers, and sisters have borrowed my Corsica when their own cars had broken down.  We have taken the Corsica on trips out of state several times.

As I said, I still have this car, I love it because it has over 225,000 miles on it, we live in Michigan and guess what?  When I turn the key, it starts right up!!!! It is the car my son is still driving while home on summer break from college.  

I did have to purchase another vehicle this year.  Yes, I chose another GM vehicle.  This time, I picked another good one, the Venture is great!  But, I still love my Corsica.

Unfortunately, GM no longer makes the Corsica's.  I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a good dependable used car.  Up till now, I have only had basic repairs (belts, breaks, etc.) on this car.  The secret...keep the oil and oil filters changed (every 3 months or 3,000 miles) on a regular basis.  But, let us give credit where credit is due, GM manufactured an excellent car this time. 

It just broke my heart that I had to face the fact that the Corsica is near the end.  Still, a mechanic friend says that it is a good car and  even though it now needs head gaskets and fuel injectors that I should consider having it repaired for continued use.  I don't know what to do, can I say it one last time, I love my Corsica!<br><br>
