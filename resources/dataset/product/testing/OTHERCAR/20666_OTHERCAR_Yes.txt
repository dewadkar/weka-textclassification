            Before you go crucifying me for saying that in the title understand this: I'm not saying it because the A8 is a bad car but rather because there's a better 8-series Audi to be had.

Until recently, however, you could only get it in Europe.  What, you ask, is the end-all, be-all of Audi A8s?  Simply put: the S8.

During a recent trip to relatives back in the old country I was presented with the opportunity to drive an Audi S8 sedan.  Luckily Audi has seen fit to keep changes between the European model and the NA to a minimum (one exception: the NA is NOT available with a manual transmission--a huge disappointment for the enthusiastic driver).  As such, the model you can buy right now at any Audi dealership is very nearly the same one I've driven back in Europe.  As for what separates the ordinary (and "ordinary" as used here is a relative term considering standard A8s are fantastic automobiles) from the extraordinary S8 please read on.  

The S8 is essentially the same basic car as the A8 but this time around with the 4.2 Liter 40-valve engine tweaked to 360(!) horsepower.  Now, I've driven regular A8's before and they don't stand a chance against this spawn of satan.  Try 0-60 in 5.5 seconds.  Think "bigger, (slightly slower) all-aluminum E55, with quattro handling" and you won't be far off.  This car feels like it was crafted from solid aluminum.  No squeaks, no rattles.  But it's not detached from the road.  You feel what's going on beneath you and in turn the car is near telepathic in its steering.  Coupled with the tenacious grip of the quattro drive this car is near foolproof--although you can still achieve some glorious rally-racing-style four wheel drift.

Of course the S8 is also devastatingly handsome.  It takes the A8 body and does minor cosmetic surgery, although its all for the better, mind you.  A front air dam and gorgeous Avus-style rims (like the S4) turned heads when I was driving this car, even in Europe where the taxis have 17 inch aftermarket wheels.  However this car does not obnoxiously scream, "I AM A RICH AND FAST CAR!"  If you ask me it is all the better for it.  other subtle changes are limited to the side-view mirrors, exhaust, and discreet "S8" badging.  In any case all the positives that apply to the regular A8 also apply to the S8.  Vault-like quiet.  Expansive roominess.  Sheer luxury.

In particular the interior stands out in the S8 (and any A8, really, as the interior is little changed).  For whatever reason Audi manages to build the most beautiful and ergonomically perfect interiors in any car.  Period.  The dashboard is a masterpiece, the controls extremely intuitive, and the seats amazing.  Simply try to find fault.

In short, this is one car that does everything well.  Great engine, chassis, stereo, style, space, performance, and handling.  By far one of the greatest drives on the planet.
