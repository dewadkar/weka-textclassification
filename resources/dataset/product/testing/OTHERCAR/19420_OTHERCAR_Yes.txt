            The Good:
1) A lot of usable space.  Seems to seat and store the same amount of cargo as my mother's Jeep Cherokee.  And I love the split fold-down seats - they make it easy to carry extra large items in a matter of minutes.
2) The mileage is decent.  Approx. 23 mi/gallon.
3) Handles great - better than my last car.
4) I wish I knew when the 4WD kicked in, but it seems to be working great.  I felt more in control in a major downpour than in a car.
5) Love the space b/w the front seats that allows you to get to the back seat if necc. (especially useful if there's kids in the back seat) - this is actually one of the primary reasons I chose the Honda CRV over the RAV4.

The Not Really All That Bad:
1) It's a fairly noisy ride.  I have to adjust the radio volume up several notches when I'm on the freeway.
2) Gear shifting on steep hills often seems a little off.
3) The driver's buttons for window up/down and door locks are in confusing places.  I've had the car 6 months now and I still occasionally lock the doors when I mean to put my window up and vice versa.
4) The table in the back is a fun perk, but it's always too hard to get to when I'm actually carrying stuff for camping/picnicing.
5) Missing an armrest on the front passenger seat.

Overall I'm very happy with the purchase.  It's good to commute in and take on weekend trips.
