            I bought my SONY &quot;Cyber-Shot&quot; in San Francisco at the Sony Metreon Store. It was just on the market and what a find. I used the camera while hiking in Muir Woods to the Pacific Ocean, dinning in San Francisco, walking the Pacific Heights city tour, and shopping the streets of Castro. I just recently used the MPEG recording functions to record over 3 minutes of full motion sound and video. I have a laptop and use the special PC-Card adapter to transfer my still photos and movies to my computer. The plug and play of Windows 2000 and Windows 98 make it a snap. I recently used the online photo printing offered by wolfe camera. (Http://www.wolfecamera.com) and they are great! I used the highest resolution (1200x1600) and sent both color, B&amp;W, and Sephia photos. They came back VERY, VERY clear. I only wished Sony made a very cool belt carrying case for the camera. It's small enough for a coat pocket, but kind of bulky for touring or hiking in pockets.
Overall the camera is a VERY good deal. I paid high dollar, but now the price has dropped. I also know Sony is making the 32MB memory stick available. These will make the photo count go to about 40 and the movie to about 10 minutes. WOW!<br><br>
