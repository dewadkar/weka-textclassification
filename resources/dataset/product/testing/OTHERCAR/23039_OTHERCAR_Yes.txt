            This is how it should be! You put down $200 bucks on the counter and you get the camera with the leads and memory card and the software to put the pics on your computer and you also get a case and a strap for the camera. Now if I was paying for a regular camera I'd have to fork out for film and developing on top of this and I also wouldn't be sure my pics would turn out. They may be over exposed, under exposed, blurry, or just plain ruined! on the PDC 640 you get to see if the picture is ok before you continue and if you don't like the picture you can delete it now or later. I have had a couple of problems with mine but to Polaroids credit they have had a camera to me within a week of the problem being reported.
With regards to the camera itself, The flash has 4 settings (Auto, Always, Never and Red Eye Eliminator) and has 4 picture quality settings (Standard, Good, Better and Best). I always use the standard setting because it gives me the most pictures per card (96 pics) Good gives 36 Pics, Better gives 24 pics and Best gives 12 pics although I have never seen any quality difference between the Good and the Best settings.
The camera also gives you the option of reviewing your pictures in an album style which gives easy access to pictures you need to delete. There is also a slide bar that alters the flash distance and gives you 3 settings for this. Close-ups, Medium shots and far away shots.
This is a basic Digital Camera at a basic price with great features. If I knew then what I know now about the Polaroid PDC 640 I'd still choose it. It's been a good friend.
