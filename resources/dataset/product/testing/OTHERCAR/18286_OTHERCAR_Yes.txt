            I'm tempted to write a review about my 2002 Stratus ES

This car, first off, drives beautifully. I drove it in the snow for the first time last week. it was 20 degrees out, and the 2.7 v6 started up right away. there was some slight vibration, probably from the frozen engine mounts, but after a couple minutes it ran like butter. it idles at 1100 for a minute or two, then drops to 900, then to 700. i keep the heater off cuz it's still cold, but i kick on the rear defroster. the window's clear before i depart. i'm able to clean the front windshield with just the wipers and washer fluid. i put it into reverse, pull out, then shift to drive. i get onto the street and the first shift cycle is stiff. about a mile down the road i turn on the heater and it's piping hot, all windows are clear, and the car is shifting like butter. i have no ABS brakes, however i can still brake quite powerfully before the wheels lock up in the snow, thanks to the good Eagle LS tires. i was able to make the car slip a little in the ice, but was still in control and corrected my steering effortlessly. i've had this car since may of 2003, and have never experienced a single NVH, except during the first minute at idle. the car is surprisingly quiet too, and only has loud roadnoise when the rear seats are folded down. 

DRIVING - COMFORT

the car is equipped with cloth seats and lumbar support and power driver seat. i can instantly find a comfortable driving position. the seats are firm, yet not at all painful for roadtrips. the wings on the seats keep you in place during invasive manuvers.  ;)  the back seat has excellent room for 2 adults or 3 kids. the rear also has 2 heater ducts (active during heat only) for the rear passengers on the floor. the car has low windnoise, virtually no roadnoise unless i drive over gravel, potholes, rough terrain etc. driving at 80+mph and there are no vibrations. windnoise is present, but not annoying. above 70, crosswinds do effect the car, but are not dangerous, and are easy to overcome. 

PERFORMANCE

equipped with the 200HP v6, i feel this car has plenty of power to do what it was built to do. it is not a sportscar by any means, but i'd feel comfortable calling it a performance sedan. when pushed, the stratus is extremely quick on its feet. the 41TE trans. stops being smooth and gets down right aggressive with shifting when pushed. on rainy days, when punched, the 2-1 downshift will actually make the wheels squeal for a fraction. the 2.7 lacks some low end torque, so must be pushed up to 3000 or more for good, rapid acceleration. 
the suspension is excellent as well. it's stiff enough to give good handling, yet absorbs bad road imperfections without being sloppy. the front and rear stabilizer bars aid you in making 40mph 90 degree turns without any protest from the car. 
though lacking ABS, the brakes are powerful, and sometimes abrupt if you dont modulate them properly. if you are not carefull, you can lock them up under very extreme braking. however, they are so effective, you should never need to brake that hard. brake fade, i have not experienced yet, even during aggressive driving in 90 degree heat. under the fron facia are air ducts that direct wind right to the rotors, and keeps them cool. the drivetrain gives good engine braking when coming to a stop. however, for more engine braking, like when driving 40 mph or less in rush-hour traffic, it's a good idea to use gear 3 for max engine braking. 
gas milage is very good for this 6 cylinder. i usually get 20 in the city and up to 35 on the highway driving 60mph. driving 70 or more, the milage drops to 22-24mpg.

RELIABILITY

since may, this car has been an extremely reliable, well built car. there are no vibrations or rattles inside. everything does what it should. the fake wood, in my opinion, looks good. leather steeringwheel and shifter. all i've done is changed oil on it, and rotate tires. 
since aquiring the car, i have had just one warantee repair. the trans. cooler lines cracked and leaked. so those were fixed for free with an updated design. other than that, the car has been trouble free. 

OPTIONS

my stratus is an ES model which came with the compass and trip computer. leather steering wheel and shifter. power driver seat. power everything. 120watt Chrysler PremiumGold stereo system. 
the sound system is by far, the best factory stereo system i have ever heard. it even rival's Chrysler's systems that Infinity makes. it has 6 speakers with a 120 watt amplifier under the passenger seat. there are 2 6x9s in the rear, 26x9s in the front doors and 2" tweeters in the dash. each of the four channels is individually equalized by chrysler for the interior of the stratus with 4 band analog equalization. the head unit comes with stereo/cd player with changer controls. system frequency response is 35hz - 18khz. 
the rear speakers are specially amplified to make use of the trunk as a bass box. therefore, this car has amazing bass output. distortion does not become noticable until your ears start to hurt. you'll probably never listen to it that loud, so distortion should'nt be a problem. 

ADDITIONS

some customizing i've done to the car is as follows:

- chrome MOPAR valve stem caps
- silver mopar vinyl logo on rear window
- MOPAR Mashershield undercoating applied


In summary. this is an excellent car for families, or the single person who wants a comfortable sedan that is able to go quite fast and have good handling. it is a reliable car with excellent options and sound system. the powertrain is very good, and does not seem to have any of the problems former chrysler powertrains did in the early 90s. 

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAR TO:

- families with little kids
- single persons
- college students
