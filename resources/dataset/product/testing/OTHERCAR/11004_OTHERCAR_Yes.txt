                In August we totaled our 1986 Arostar, our only transportation and we live 12 miles form town. So we got a ride to the local Chevy Dealer. I wanted a full size van but the only vans they had were 5 Astros. We picked a silver SL model with 2 wheel drive and slip deferential(works very well in snow)it has all the gadgets and it took us a couple of days to figure out all of them.

     I really like the seats in the back, both benches slide forward and back and fold down for more cargo space. The cargo net is wonderful for those items that roll around in the van. We had problems with the muffler but the warranty covered that. In fact the coverage on the van is top drawer. We do not have to tune-up the engine for 100,000 miles and the fluids(except oil) do not need to be changed for 150,000 miles!

     The Astro is very quiet but does not go around curves as well as the Express conversion van. Well as I like to say it drives like a van, but it drives better than the old Arostar. The engine is powerful for its size. I really would have liked to gotten a larger engine but the Astro only comes with one size engine.

     The Astro is excellent for families. It has more room than the more expensive mini-van. You can chose from the basic to the LT that has leather seating. <br><br>
