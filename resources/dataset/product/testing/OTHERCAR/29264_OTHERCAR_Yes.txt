My family and I currently own a 1995 Chevy 4 door Blazer 4x4. The Blazer is a very reliable vehicle. It has the comfort of a roomie car, enough seating for the whole family, and plenty of storage in the back. The gas mileage is a great feature too. The push button 4 wheel drive is a great feature. It is situated to make it easier to operate, without having to reach in the floor. It is compact enough to make it easy to maneuver in crowded parking lots, yet roomie enough to make a trip comfortable. I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a SUV. It's stylish looks, ease of handling, and extra features make it a great purchase. <br><br>
