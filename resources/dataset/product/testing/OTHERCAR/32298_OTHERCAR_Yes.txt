            I have been enjoying my Sentra for the past year.  I bought one of the first 99 Sentras that came onto the lot.  At this point I am very happy with my purchase, but I felt that there were a few issues that the car buyer needs to know.  


First, the sentra does not come with a very powerful engine.  Me and my roommate both own the new sentra and we are both unhappy with the engine performance.  It is a great car for the average driver.  I has no problem getting up to speed on the freeways and around town, but if you live in a area with large hills or you just want a powerful car, this is not the car for you.  However, you do have the option when purchasing the Sentra to upgrade the engine.  I have yet to drive the Sentra with the more powerful engine, so I could not tell you how it stand up.  


The other problem that I have with the car is that it has a hard time keeping an alignment.  I have discussed this issue with the dealer and I have been told that all the newer Sentras are having the same problem.  The slightest bump of a curb or pot hole will throw your alignment out.  


In general, this is a great car.  I get excellent gas mileage and it is very low maintenance, but please be aware of these issues before purchasing the car.  <br><br>
