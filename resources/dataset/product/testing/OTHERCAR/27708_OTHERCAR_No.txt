            I will not include any Mitsubishi product in my current auto search.  I currently own an Eclipse.  The timing belt, a small, inexpensive rubber item, broke causing several thousand dollars damage.  The Mitsubishi repair shop estimated cost at $3-5,000.  They informed me this was common with Eclipse.  They pointed out another Eclipse in their shop with the same problem.  Cost, $3500.  The sales manager from whom I purchased the car told me timing belt breaks almost always cause major damage in the Eclipse.  Several auto repairmen tell me such damage doesn't happen with other makes.
The Eclipse I had prior to had major transmission problems.  Replacement transmission was estimated at $5000 new, $3500 rebuilt, $2000 used. The transmission shop told me that make has the second most expensive transmission to repair behind only Mercedes.  
Eclipse are fun to drive, but be prepared for major problems with expensive repairs.  There are many other similar cars on the market in the same price range that isn't well known for costly repairs, more fun to drive, higher hp, larger engine, more features for your money.  <br><br>
