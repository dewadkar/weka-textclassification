            I have never had the privilege of owning a brand new car.  I was always stuck with the &quot;left-overs&quot; and used vehicles that had left me stranded at the side of a freeway one too many times.  I longed for the luxury of a smooth ride in an &quot;air-conditioned&quot; environment.....where I wouldn't stick to the vinyl plastic seats.
After our pick-up truck recently &quot;died&quot; with no hopes of a successful repair job, my husband and I began a search for a new vehicle.....preferably a new pick-up truck.  We didn't really have our hearts set on any particular make and/or model.  We just knew that we needed a car rather quickly.

We talked about getting a truck that had a &quot;king cab&quot; and little fold down seats in the back.....getting ready to start a family in a few years.  However, we were quite impressed from the start when we came across the Nissan Frontier Crew Cab.

This truck has the room in the front cab area to seat up to five people.  The four full size doors make it easy to get in and out of the vehicle.  I am 5'4&quot; and find it quite comfortable sitting in the back seat.  My husband who is 5'10&quot; states that it is ok for him to sit in the back seat for shorter distances.....but he wouldn't want to do it for any extended length of time.  We anticipate that this vehicle will also be great for when we begin to have kids.....for they will fit quite comfortably in the back seat.  To make up for the larger front cab area, the bed of the pick-up is a bit shorter.  We made up for the shorter bed by purchasing a &quot;bed-extender&quot; that folds out for use with longer loads.  We have been able to transport all items that we have needed to without any major difficulties.

We purchased a five speed stick shift and find it to drive very smoothly and easily.  I much prefer automatic transmissions, but I really do not mind driving this vehicle.  We have owned our Frontier for three months now and have not had any problems at all.  

Our extended families and friends have all expressed an interest and liking to our new purchase!<br><br>
