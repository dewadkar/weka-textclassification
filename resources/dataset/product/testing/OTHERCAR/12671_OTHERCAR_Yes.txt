            Recently my husband and I spoiled ourselves by purchasing a used 1997 Chevy Cavalier Convertible.  We had talked for some time about getting a convertible in the future, but when we went out looking just for fun and ran across the great deal on this little number, we found a way to afford it now rather than later.

I guess we lucked out, really.  The car has only had one owner, who absolutely babied it, and at 4 years old has only 36,000 miles.  A CD player is about the only thing it is lacking, and that's no big deal to us anyway.  Fully equipped with air, tilt, cruise, power windows and locks, keyless remote entry, power steering and a powerful little V-6 2.4 litre engine, this little car seemed like a real bargain at a final price of only $10,500.

We had looked at and test driven other convertibles.  Our first experiment was with a 2001 Ford Mustang, the type of car my husband especially had always dreamed of owning.  It was a beautiful car, totally out of our price range at $23,000, but we wanted to drive it just to say we did.  Man, were we disappointed!  We expected real power, and the bold roar of the engine.  We didn't even come close.  I mean, it rode nicely and all, but perhaps we just expected too much.  In comparison, we both agree that the Chevy has WAY more kick for the type of car it is.  It is one powerful little number, with a lot more get up and go for it's size than the Mustang.  You can hit the gas and this little baby takes off like wildfire.  Plus, it rides wonderfully.  Smooth as silk.

And let's talk gas mileage.  With the recent soar in fuel prices, you can't go wrong with this car.  The gas mileage is outstanding.  Around 22 to 24 in town, and upwards of 28 to 30 on the highway.  And the fact that you don't have to run your air conditioning as much certainly saves a little gas anyway!  With the top down, especially out on the highway, you have your own natural air conditioning.

And while we are on the subject of having the top down....
what a breeze it is with this car!  2 of my friends have convertibles of their own, and with both, putting the top up and down is a much more complicated process.  To put it up you have to get it in just the right spot, then fuss with pulling little clips down to lock it into place.  The clips are often stubborn, and sometimes it takes quite a great deal of strength to pull them into place.  With the Cavalier it is a different story altogether.  Totally automatic.  Just push a button, pull the lever down, and move it forward or backward.  It does all the work itself, with no clips to fool with.  A word to the wise, though.  If your car comes with a "boot" (a top to put over the other top when it is down), don't fool with it unless you are on a long trip and you can be assured that there will be no rain.  We spent a good 10 minutes trying to get the 3 pieces to the boot in place, and we realized that, should we ever get caught in a sudden storm with the top down, taking the thing off to put the top up would be too much of a pain.  Spending the approximately 5 minutes it takes to do this would pretty much ensure that the inside of the car would be drenched, so if I were to offer one piece of advice, it would be to leave the boot in the trunk.

I would say that this would be a great car for almost anyone, with the exception of large families.  It might make a good secondary or extra set of wheels, but it would not be great for traveling with several people.  It is roomy enough, but who wants to keep climbing in and out of the back seat on a long road trip??  It is great for people just like us, who as of yet have no children.  There again, there is plenty of room for little ones, but having to load a kid into a baby seat on a regular basis would probably get tiresome.  Even so, I have taken my own nephews for a ride in the back of it.  They are big enough to ride with only a seat belt, and for that it is fine.  Basically to us, the car is and will be a summertime toy.  We opted to keep our 1994 Pontiac Grand Prix, because it is not only paid for but much more practical for traveling with other people.  The Chevy has plenty of room for my husband and I to travel, but putting in even one other person gets a little crowded with luggage and all.  The trunk is deep and fairly roomy, but with me on the trip it could be a problem....you know, I just gotta take it ALL with me!  This would also be a great first car for a young couple or student.  With it's great gas mileage it would be very practical, plus I think it to be very safe.  With dual airbags, ABS brakes, and roomy interior, I feel safe driving it.  It is small, but not compact, and I don't think it would be as dangerous in an accident as, say, a Geo Metro.  Course that is being said without having ever HAD an accident, and let's hope I never do!

Really, for the money, I think you just can't go wrong with this car.  It is an affordable luxury, and with its looks and performance so far I am just as proud of it as I was when I drove that Mustang.  It is really a snappy little vehicle, and I am thoroughly enjoying it, especially on these hot summer days.
