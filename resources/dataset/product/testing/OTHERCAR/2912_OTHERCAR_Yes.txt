            <b>- Introduction -</b>
I recently got rid of my old vehicle, and I was looking for something new, and I'd been thinking to get the Integra, I really liked that car, and it was different. After much shopping I finally settled with an Acura RSX premium, the reason for not getting the S was purely insurance. :(
With 160HP and 140 pounds of torque, this wasn't slow by any means. With regard to the "torqueless" aspect this simply is not true, especially not by the Type-S, the Type-S can do 0-60MPh in 6.1 seconds; faster than a Porsche Boxster. 

<b>- Performance & Handling -</b>
On the base, there is adequate handling for the power output, much better than my last car riding on 17" Konig rims and Yokohamaï¿½s Z rated tires. The car just seems to hold the road better than my previous car. 4 wheel disc brakes come stock with all models, and really help the car to stop on a dime. With my new Injen intake the car purrs quite nicely now, and I'm just waiting to finish up the exhaust with perhaps some new headers and exhaust, but I'm not planning that far ahead yet. :) Over bumpy roads it does sound kind of noisy, but I'm almost positive it's from the Michelin Pilots. Control on water and snow is decent, stopping on either will have the ABS brakes kick in pretty quick (if they are equipped) and help you steer in the direction you want to go.

<b>- Exterior Styling -</b>
I must admit when I first saw the RSX, I did not like the front end, the rear end was gorgeous, but the front.. at least in the pictures. Well, pictures do not do this car justice, and when you see the front end, you quickly become attached to it. The curves of the car are smooth, and everything just seems to "flow" the ONLY thing I wish they had was side bumpers, you know for those people who can't open their door without bashing your car? To date, (and I knock on wood) no-one has done any damage to my car. :)

<b>- Interior Styling -</b>
The interior is defiantly nicely designed, the dash has this honeycomb design is kinda neat, but worries me on how I'm going to keep all them little craters clean (Think I might have to use some compressed air..) the vents are definitely neat they spin 360 degree's and thus can direct air in almost any direction. Climate control is definitely a nice option so the temperature holds at a certain temp. As with all new Acura's once you hit the defrosters, the A/C comes on automatically and helps defrost the windows -FAST- Just be sure to turn the A/C off once your done with it. :)

<b>- Sound -</b>
Sound is pretty decent, nothing like my 2 12" woofers I used to have in my old car, but for a factory system, it's decent. 6 speakers come with the premium edition, which I assume add the two tweeters at the front. The Type-S has a nice Bose system with a unique woofer that sits in the spare tire. The factory system has a bit of a problem reading scratched disc's where my old aftermarket system had no trouble reading it, but it doesn't skip that badly either (You have to go over a pretty big bump to make it skip) I'm considering replacing it with aftermarket only because I like the design of the aftermarket deck's, not for functionality (except CD-TEXT.. wish they had that on factory systems!)

<b>- Cargo Capacity / Fuel Economy -</b>
Cargo is limited at the rear, however, the back seats fold down to give you a lot more room to put those suitcases or computer parts in, but not enough room to put a serious sound system in, for what it is, it's definitely nothing to scoff at. Fuel economy is sweet! On a 2L engine, I get about 450km/tank (or 280 Miles) conservatively driving, more aggressive driving gets you about 400km/tank (or 250 Miles) 

<b>- Conclusion -</b>
In a nutshell, and a very vague one at that, that is the Acura RSX, Go down to your local Acura dealer and have a test drive, but be warned, the car you drive there is only the "show car" and chances are it's not broken in properly, and lacks a bit of the spirit your own car would have (at least that was the case with me)
