            MY PROBLEMS WITH MY 1997 PONTIAC SUNFIRE STARTED LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AFTER I PURCHASED IT BRAND NEW. THE CAR DIED ON ME DUE TO A BAD BATTERY? SHORTLY AFTER THAT THE PASSENGER'S SIDE POWER WINDOW DIED, THREE SEPARATE TIMES. THE LCD DISPLAY ON THE RADIO DID NOT LAST MORE THAN THREE YEARS. THE CAR HAS RUN 'HOT' SINCE PURCHASED, AND IF IT RUNS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, SAY WHILE WAITING AT THE BANK DRIVE-THROUGH, IT STARTS TO OVERHEAT. CURRENTLY THE ENGINE RUNS TERRIBLY, THE "SERVICE ENGINE SOON" LIGHT COMES ON CONSTANTLY, THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW IS NOT OPERATIONAL AND I HAVE SPENT SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS ONLY TO GET THE CAR BACK IN JUST AS HORRIBLE CONDITION! THE CAR ALSO ROLLED OUT OF A PARKING SPACE WHILE IN GEAR WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE  ENGAGED!I DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD SELL IT IN SUCH CONDITION AND I STILL OWE MONEY ON IT! PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS CAR AND IF YOU MUST PLEASE TAKE MINE OFF MY HANDS.
