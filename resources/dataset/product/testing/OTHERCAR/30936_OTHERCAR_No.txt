            I reciently got rid of my 1996 Sebring Coupe. I fell in love with the way it looked from the first time I sat it sitting on the lot. A really eye catcher. Its just too bad that they didn't put more heart into the machine and make it run as fast as it looked. My 4-cylinder with an automatic transmission was a real drag. I think I bought the car strictly for how it looked. It looked FAST. The drivers side was well set up but I wouldn't want to be sitting in the back seat behind a driver like myself, no leg room. But then hey, I don't have a family to drive around either. I was using it as a mode of transportation to and from work. One other problem I had with my Sebring was the Charging system. I went through 2 batteries in 2 years. I took it to the shop and they could not figure it out. Besides being under powered and a minor electrical problem, it was fun to drive. It cornered really well at all speeds and did catch a lot of eyes. If they could make a few improvements I think this would be a good car. Two words... MORE POWER!<br><br>
