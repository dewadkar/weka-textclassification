            Anyone in the market for a small sport utility vehicle would be wise to choose the Rav4. It has all the qualities and reliability of a Toyota. They are rated excellent by Consumer Reports. It was voted vehicle of the year for 1997. It does not have the road noise and wind noise others have. It has more head room than the 4runner, although if you are very tall the front seat might not move back far enough for you. The back door opens easy with a one step process. You do not have to first move the spare tire out of the way, or first lift the back window, etc. The cargo space has more than enough room, and the back seats flip forward for even more room. The front &amp; back seats both recline back, and will recline flat if you feel like camping in it! It gets good gas mileage for an all wheel drive (about 24 mpg). It is very comfortable to drive, even on long trips. Its easy to get in and out of; not too tall, not too short. Easy to drive around town, very small turning radius, feels like your driving a car. Has great visability, and you are sitting up high enough to see whats going on. Has all the benefits of full time 4wd. Handles great in the snow. The wind doesn't blow you off the road. And they hold their resale value extremely well.<br> This is my second Rav4, my first was a 1997, automatic transmission. The 96' and early 97's had an ugly blue pattern on the seats so I had after-market leather installed, which was really nice. Leather is now available from the factory. I leased the 1998 to lower my payments because of a child on the way.The 1998 is a 5 speed, which was about $1000 cheaper, and it seems to be more fun to drive. The 5 speed makes it feel like it has more spunk. I had the Toyota security system installed in both of them. The keyless entry feature alone makes it worth it. One more thing, mine is a 4-door. I personally do not like the looks of the 2 door, nor the lack of cargo space. <br>I hope this has been informative for you. I guarantee you will love it!<br><br><br>
