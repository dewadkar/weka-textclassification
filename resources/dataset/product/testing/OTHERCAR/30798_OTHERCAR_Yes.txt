             Over the summer I decided to go out and buy a good digital camera. I only had $300, so I went with this camera. This camera is an all around great camera. It has all the high end features the other high priced cameras have, and small in size. There are some bad things about the camera though.One, There is a x2 zoom which really doesn't do anything. Second, you have to hold the camera really still or put the camera on a tripod because if you move it at all, it will come out all fuzzy. Thirdly, It sucks up the battery life very quickly. I would consider buying some re-chargeable batteries. I also got to try my friends brand new sony camera($1,000). My $300 camera had a better quality. In closing, if you don't care about the zoom, and have a steady hand go out a get this one!<br><br>
