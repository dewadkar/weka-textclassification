            This is a wonderful car.  Very comfortable ride with excellent gas mileage.  On a long distance trip I was getting around 37 mpg.  The inside controls are simple.  It provides ample heat and AC.  The stereo system is super.  You can live in the trunk, plus it comes with a full size spare tire.  The car will go if you punch the pedal.  At speeds between 50-80 mph you feel like you're gliding on air.  The engine is super quiet.  The styling is ok, but a little on the bland side.  But, sporty enough for a sedan.

Some cons:  the brakes take awhile to get used to.  They are mushy.  But you adjust.  It handles the curves ok, but not like a TSX or Passat.  

It has nice space below the controls for CDs, sunglasses, or whatever.  I installed an XM radio there.  The arm rest provides a deep inner pocket to hold tons of stuff, plus it's easy to open.  The inner lights stay on for just the right amount of time to enter and exit.  The horn will not sound if you remote lock, but I like that touch.  The lights blink to let you know, so you don't wake up the neighbors.

The inside is nice and spacious.  If you are 6'4" like me, this is the car for you.  I have roughly 3" to the roof.  There is plenty of space in the back to provide a ride for many, and they are comfortable unlike some of the other sedans.  

The wipers work nicely.  The doors are sound.  When you shut them you can tell.  You have to hold down on the remote for awhile to open the trunk, but you get used to it.  But, it does have a key hole to use your key if you want.  Lots of other sedans don't give you this option.  It also comes with manual daytime running lights.  You use them at your call.  The lights shut off automatically if you forget to turn them off.  Nice feature.  The locks will relock if you don't open the door within 10 seconds of remote unlocking.  Nice safety.

You get Toyota reliability and a Lexus feel for under 20K.
