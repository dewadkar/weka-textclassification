            Overview:

This camera is a great digital camera for beginners who don't want to spend a lot of money on a feature packed camera they most likely wouldn't use to its full potential, and who don't want to sacrifice very limited features with a lower priced camera. It's great for taking day and night photos as long as you're within good range of your subject and have even just a dim light source; the flash will take care of the rest. It comes with a small set of settings to play around with that would satisfy any digital camera newbie.


Positive aspects:

First and foremost, the price is unbeatable! There are other 200 dollar and under cameras that just cannot compare to the Nikon 2100. Most lack the feature capabilities and in some cases, even any kind of optical zoom. The Nikon covers both of those bases. The mode dial makes it easy to quickly change the mode of the camera. There are 8 shooting modes and setup modes. Also worth noting are 14 scene selections to choose from. The camera is also small and light-weight at  5.3oz or aprox. 2 full CD cases (in my measurements).


Negative aspects:

The camera comes with a feature that automatically shuts off the LCD screen if the camera is idle for a few seconds to save battery. Sounds like a good idea since the batteries that come with the camera, don't tend to last very long. I'd say a day or two of shooting. However, this "feature" tends to be more of an annoyance, and hinders trying to setup that 'perfect shot'. The Nikon 2100 also comes with a small 16MB card that will only hold about 16 Hi-Res pictures, or 30 "Normal" pictures. And forget about getting a discount on purchasing an extra (larger) compact flash card with the purchase of your Nikon because there isn't one.


Overall:

Overall I like the Nikon 2100 and would recommend it to the novice digital camera user. For the price and the features, you can't beat it.
