            Honda has done it again.  With their up to date technology Honda has made the 4 cylinder S2000 engine rip out an amazing 240 horsepower.  The rpm capacity is also breathtaking at 8900.  The chasis is wonderful with excellent handling and grip to the road.  The brakes are very powerful as well and stop on a dime.  The positioning of the car is another amazing aspect by Honda engineers.  The seats and viewing area are excellent so that you can see the entire road very clearly.  There are no superchargers that power this baby, just all natural technology and a lot of it. Go HONDA!
Maybe a little expensive that's all $32,000.
