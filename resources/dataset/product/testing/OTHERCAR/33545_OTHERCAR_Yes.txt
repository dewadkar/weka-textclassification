            I have two BMW 5 series cars.  One is a 1985 535i, one is a 1988 528e(basically the same car with a smaller 6 cylinder).

The 1985 535i series has the largest six cylinder engine that was made by BMW, other 5 series may have slightly smaller engines.  These cars have the standard options you would expect on a car that was more expensive than most out there.

Leather seats(vary in condition- but will show some wear by now)
Cruise control(This is one of the things that seems to need repair over time)
Computer with temperature, timer, gas mileage, fuel remaining.  Note: On a car this old the computer display lamps are/or will burn out.  There is a small plastic tray behind the display you can take out- I recommend replacing the old burnt out lamps with 12V yellow LEDS.  Note, regular LEDS will not work- you have to get 12V ones.

Other features- manual 6 transmission(Rear plus 5)
Antilock brakes
Brake wear sensor indicator.
power sliding moonroof
power windows/mirrors
power locks
power seats

Overall, I have liked my 5 series very much.  It is large enough to carry many people and equipment and it is still very fast too.

The cars tend to get a shake in the front wheels when braking hard...I think this is just a problem with all the 5 series around this time.  The problem is hard to get rid of, very hard.  you will find(as i have) that the same things seem to go out or degrade on all the 5 series.  Includes: master/slave cylinder to clutch, window seals degrade in same spots, power window buttons need to be replaced, cruise control fails, power mirrors stop working. 

Note, upkeep on an older car especially a BMW can get expensive.  Not only in labor- but the parts are expensive(sometimes overly expensive).  This is where the paradox lies.  It's an older car(note- a BMW does not go out of style like other cars)but to some degree it carries a price tag of a newer inexpensive car.

Like I said, parts can get expensive. This isn't a car for someone who is looking for inexpensive transportation.

Don't let the used car price fool you- you will pay a much higher amount for repairs and upkeep.  Plan on spending $1000 on the car right away and then there is the upkeep.  Try $300 for a muffler and $700 for a new exhaust, $200 for a power steering hydraulic hose(that's not expensive, that is robbery!).  About the only thing on the entire car that is inexpensive is the headlamps.

If you buy a car like this, you should buy it based on the fact that you like the car enough to put money into it.  
Otherwise, plan to spend $1000 upfront and a small car payment $150 a month average for upkeep(does not include tires and other general car items).  If you can deal with this, you should have a nice BMW/otherwise you will quickly have a parts car.

7-24-02 Update: Well, I was saddened this week by the loss of this car.  I was involved in an accident where a large pickup truck hauling a 30 foot RV trailer slammed into the back of me.  It sent my car into a few spins and threw it off the road into a ditch.  

The car still drives!  I drove it away from the accident and it returned me to home. Unfortunately, the damage to this car is too extensive to repair. I am currently searching for a replacement.  I found a 1986 535i that I may get and take the parts off this car (it has many new parts on it).  I guess I am hooked on these cars for better or worse.  It helps if you have the ability to work on them yourself.
