                 You don't need to know a lot about cameras or photography or computers to know this camera's not something you want to waste your time with.

     It's a cheap (both in monetary cost and in quality) attempt to get folks who want to jump into the digital world to throw a little money toward Agfa.  If you've been suckered into thinking this is the best quality you can expect from a digital camera, please think again and try other cameras before you give up.

     What really bugs me is Agfa is well known for producing wonderful  film and paper.  Why would they lend their name to an obviously inferior product like the <i>Smile</i>?  (I can't help thinking the guys in Agfa's finance department named the camera as an inside joke ... &quot;Yeah, then we can 'Smile' all the way to the bank!&quot;)

     I thought having an inexpensive digital camera would be nice.  You know the story: &quot;I'll send digital pictures of all my fish to my friends in Alaska ... boy, won't they be jealous.&quot;

     After a recent trip to the Banana River I brought home a few nice fish and decided to try out my new camera.  Snap-snap-snap.  Then I rushed inside and waited with baited breath (sorry, couldn't resist the pun) as my digital images crawled into the computer by way of the cable hookup.  

     I opened the files in the Agfa software provided with the camera and immediately thought I must have made a mistake.  Surely the reason these photos were of such a poor quality must have been operator error.  Maybe I left the lens cap on, or I had my finger stuck in front of the lens.  The images were blotchy, fuzzy, out-of-focus, pixellated trash.

     I rushed back outside and repeated the process more carefully.  Snap.  Snap.  Snap.  Back inside I feverishly watched as my computer digested the ones and zeros the camera fed it through the umbilical cord.  Once again I opened the files.  And the photo quality still sucked.

     It must be because of the software, I thought.  So I opened a select image in my Adobe Photoshop software.  I was right, the image looked worse.

     So, if it wasn't operator error, and it wasn't the software interface ... well, you get the picture -- that is, unless you're using an Agfa Smile.<br><br>
