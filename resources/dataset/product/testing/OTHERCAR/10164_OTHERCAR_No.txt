            This car is completely out-classed by the new 2001 Infiniti QX4. I don't get what people see in the RX300 (other than the big &quot;L&quot; on the grill).  Sure, it's a Lexus (so it's stylish and reliable and all that), but it really doesn't measure up to the new <b><i>240hp</i></b> 2001 QX4 in <i>any</i> measurable category.

Take for instance, the utility part of the formula:  You can get more stuff into the trunk of a Camry than you can in the cargo area behind the rear seats of the RX300.  It's really tiny back there.  The angled rear window definitely cuts into the cargo space, and the short wheelbase of the Toyota Camry platform (on which the RX300 is built) simply does not provide enough space behind the rear seats to put anything bigger than a few small suitcases (forget big ones --and you can also forget about your golf bag, hockey equipment bag, etc.).

Next, let's look at the interior from a comfort and luxury point of view. As far as the styling goes ...Can you say over-priced minivan?  The entire dash and center console (what little of one there is) is VERY minivan-like in both appearance and feel.  Next take a look at the comfort thing.  There is so little room in the rear seats that I simply could not get comfortable back there no matter what I tried (I am slightly less than 6 feet tall).

Next, look at the overall size of the vehicle.  It's <i>small</i>.  Small overall size, a high center of gravity and a decided lack of interior space does not a comfortable and safe vehicle make.  Most of the RX300's competitors feel (and actually are) safer for their passengers to be in, due to their increased weight, size and overall solidity of structure.

Now look at what you get in the new 2001 Infiniti QX4 instead:  85 cubic feet of USABLE (read: w-i-d-e) cargo space (38 with the rear seats up), 240hp (from a new 3.5L V6!), the capability to tow 5,000 lbs, plenty of rear seat head, shoulder, hip and leg room (not to mention the front seats which are very roomy), rock-solid stability (no frame rails, very low relative center of gravity), genuine off-road capabilities, increased ground clearance, a better comprehensive warranty (4 years/60,000 miles vs. 4 years/50,000), better seats (the QX4's seats are incredibly comfortable, vastlt better safety all-around (even active headrests!), a standard-equipment in-dash Bose 6-disc CD changer, height-adjustable Xenon headlamps, etc, etc, etc.  Need I go on?

For me, at least... This is a no-brainer.  Then factor in the starting price of $34,150 which <i>includes</i> leather, the awesome Bose stereo, the killer engine (this thing is FAST!), power everything, etc., and the choice becomes clear almost immediately.  Even the optional premium package is a great value, providing 17&quot; alloy wheels and tires, drivers memory seating, steering wheel-mounted audio controls, auto-exit seat system, and a delicious wood-tone and leather steering wheel (think Jaguar) --all for only $600!!

Trust me on this one folks... Go drive the Lexus first, and then take the new 2001 Infiniti QX4 out for a spin.  I think the advantages will become obvious as soon as you take a seat in one.

Of course, there are always those funky tail lights on the Lexus.  But have you seen the cool new headlamps on the 2001 QX4?  Stunning!

In conclusion, ...puhleeze... If I wanted a mini-SUV, I would buy the Honda CRV or Nissan Exterra and save $15,000 in the process (hmmm... that's enough for a Civic too! *L*).  The Lexus RX300 is hopelessly out-classed by the new QX4 in terms of utility, comfort, luxury, size, safety, and probably long-term reliability too (it's a Camry platform, remember? The Camry was never intended for off-road use, and I seriously doubt the platform will stand up to anything resembling off-roading).

Do yourself a favor drive a QX4 before you plunk down your hard-earned cash on the (overpriced) Lexus.  Trust me on this one...  :-)<br><br>
