            I bought this product because I believed it was just as high quality as the more expensive models but without all the fancy additions.  I was almost turned off from buying a digital camera because of the high cost but not only do I have a great camera, but I have some extra bucks in my pocket.  

I have used this product extensively over the last few months.  What is so great is the ability to see the photo just after you take it.  The memory card called the smartmedia card doesn't hold much so I plan on buying a 32Meg card soon so that I can hold more pictures because I just keep clicking away.  There are less features on this camera than a lot of the more expensive types but I have never had any of these on the other cameras I have purchased so I am not missing anything.

Get ready to buy some rechargeable batteries though.  I would recommend Ni-Mh batteries.  I bought Energizer batteries and you can charge them up to 1000 times.  Pretty reasonably priced considering if you didn't you could spend hundreds on regular batteries.

In conclusion, I am extremely happy with my purchase and recommend purchasing it not only because of the low cost but because of the quality as well.<br><br>
