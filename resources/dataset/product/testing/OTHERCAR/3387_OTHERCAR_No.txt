            I was in the mood for a different car, and it was a beautiful summer day. So I went to this dealer to try out, just to try it out, this gorgeous, shiny, red, convertible Chrysler Le Baron!!  Well I got in it and put the top down and fell in love.  This car had power, beauty, bucket seats, plenty of storage in the trunk, the headlights were power (they covered up when you turned them off. I was having so much fun driving this car around, (in the summer)!!
   Well winter came and it got colder and colder and I noticed it was getting harder and harder to heat the inside, I had the heater core changed, that cost plenty, then it was JUST OKAY. Not great. Time past and soon it was summer again so I decided to take my first long trip in my beauty, after about 700 miles I was cruising along the highway and I heard a LOUD like POP, and the car stopped,yes, I threw a rod, here I am in the middle of nowhere with this blown engine, I had no warning ahead of time. Well had another engine put in, but I had nothing but problems after that I think I must have stuck at least $3,000.00 in it before I gave it up. I was told after I got rid of it that Le Barons are known to have all these problems. Sure now you tell me.
I went on to buy another car and did not learn my lesson, I bought a Le Baron, 1994 sedan!! That's another story.<br><br>
