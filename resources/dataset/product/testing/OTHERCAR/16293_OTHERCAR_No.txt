            The only way I could sum up this camera is that you get what you pay for, and from the looks of other epinions, its a love it or hate it model.  

I have the HP 215 which I mainly use for web-quality photographs.  For an entry level camera, it does the job.  Its a nice camera to let you know whether or not you want to invest in a digital camera.  The major problem I see with digital cameras is that they are well.. digital.  The HP 215 is a 1.3 Megapixel camera which produces shots that look like they were done on a 1.3 Megapixel camera.  Some of the pictures were quite grainy and lacked detail.  Shots of people taken indoors were definitely NOT photo quality, even on the highest setting.  In fact, in some instances the photos taken with the lower quality setting looked better.  

Keeping that in mind, you have a decent product.  The HP 215 has lots of features and is fairly easy to use.  The HP features a 2x digital zoom, and 3 different resolutions in which to take pictures.  The camera has a 2 inch LCD display that allows you to preview the pictures, or use as a viewfinder.  With a 16 MB flash card, you can expect 24 pictures at the highest resolution.  

One major drawback is the software you get with the HP.  While easy to use, the software is pretty limiting.  I expected the pictures to be able to be read as individual files, but that isn't the case.  You must use the software that comes with the camera to access the pictures from the card.  Also, don't lose the CD that's included.  It appears that HP doesn't distribute this software online.  I found this out the hard way when I tried to download the software from their website.  

A big drawback is that this camera EATS batteries.  I would advise that you invest in some hi capacity NiMH rechargeables right away.  I burned through the set of 4 Energizer E2s that came with it the first day.  The next set of Alkalines lasted only a day and a half.  I noticed that with a fresh set of batteries, it takes about 1/2 hour before the battery indicator reads only half full.  

The HP uses the compactflash type of flash card.  This type of flash card can be inserted into an inexpensive PC-Card adapter ($10) and read in the PC Card slot of your laptop, although I have yet to test this feature.  I'm not entirely sure it will work with the software that HP provides.  

Another peculiarity I noticed is that the optical viewfinder doesn't seem to match up right with the pictures taken.  Several times I accidentally cut off the top of the picture, even though the optical viewfinder showed the subjects were centered.  Using the LCD viewfinder will correct this problem, but it eats your batteries.  The display also has quite a bit of lag, requiring you to steady the camera for a few seconds before you snap the picture.  

Finally, taking pictures is not a quick and easy process.  From the time the button is pressed until the picture is captured takes about 5 to 7 seconds.  This delay is hard to get used to, and taking quick pictures back to back is impossible.  There were also times when the camera simply didn't take a picture, and the button had to be pressed again.  

Overall, I would not recommend this camera, or ANY entry-level digital camera to a photography buff.  You'll never get 35mm quality, and the features just don't warrant the sacrifice.  In short, 1.3 Megapixels just isn't enough.
