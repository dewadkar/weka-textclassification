            I leased a '99 Galant in August because of the need for a four-door car due to a new baby.  I first looked at the Mirage, because it was the cheapest, however, the new look of the Galant, and the subsequent lower-than-expected price tag drew me in.

My Galant has been mistaken for a BMW several times, including by me the first time I saw it.  However, it has a sticker of under $20K unlike the BMW.  It doesn't look like an &quot;adult&quot; car, which was my fear of buying a four-door - it looks sporty and sleek, even though I have the base model with no extras.

I like that the key opens all four doors with an extra turn and locks all four doors automatically from the outside and inside.  The trunk space is wonderful since I am now toting strollers, playpens, etc.

The only thing so far, that I don't care for, is the lack of cruise control on the base model.  It would really be a nice feature for longer trips.

The car drives very well, with good pick-up and acceleration.  It takes bumps extremely well which is a plus for those with sleeping babies in the back seat.  Gas mileage is good too.

The interior is very roomy and comfortable for people riding in the back seats as well.

I leased the Galant new from the Mitsubishi dealership, but may choose to buy it at the end of the term.  So far, I am totally pleased with car and would highly recommend it for anyone needing a bit more room than a two-door or compact car.<br><br>
