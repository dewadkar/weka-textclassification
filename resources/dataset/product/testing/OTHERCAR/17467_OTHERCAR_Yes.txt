            I love this minivan.  We looked at several others; Dodge, Chrystler, Honda, Toyota, etc...  We even looked at SUV's which would have been our first choice had price not been a factor.  What we found though is that the price difference between a minivan and an SUV was only about $2000 to $6000 with the same options.  $30,000+ for a minivan??  Come on! Give me a break!

Enter the Kia Sedona...  We initially test drove the Sedona only to get the Shrek video and because we were board.  From the minute I got inside (and saw the price tag) I knew we would end up buying it.  Then I drove it and was blown away.  It was very powerful.  The 3.5 liter 24 valve engine is much more powerful that I thought I would find in a minivan.  I researched a little before buying and some guy had stated he had one up to 130mph and I believe it! (Why I don't know, but hey.. If your minivan will do 130, more power to ya.  Heck you never know, maybe the kids are driving you crazy with "are we there yet?" and you have to go that fast before you strangle them...  ;-) 

It was also very quiet and had a smooth ride.  Very roomy inside and the EX is loaded with extras.  Heated front and rear window defroster and heated mirrors, trip computer, Nice alloy wheels (the spare is a full size tire with matching alloy wheel), fog lights, 8 way adjustable power seats, several compartments for storage, fold away tray table, etc.. 

NOW GET THIS.. All this stuff was only $23,000!!  I bought the Sedona EX with rear spoiler and Home Link options for $22,800 out the door, tax, title and license included!  

I am going to make a prediction right here and now.  Remember when the Miata came out and sold for about $12,000?  It became very popular very quickly and the price shot up just as quick.  I think that the price of the Sedona is going to go up quickly.  Maybe by the time the 2003 models come out it could be up by $2000 to $3000. (just my own guess-temate) 

I highly recommend this minivan.  Its great and you can't beat the warranty.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have had the Sedona now for over 2 years and we still are very happy with the purchase. It still drives very well and is quiet and actually gets much better gas mileage than the sticker says it will.  So I take back the CON of Gas Mileage.

The only thing I am concerned with is the tire wear. 24K miles and they almost already need to be changed. I suspect that Kia put very soft rubber tires on to improve the ride. Oh well. I saved bundles on the price of the vehicle though.

We have had no major service issues.  The ashtray wouldn't close and the rear side window vent wouldn't close, both were promptly fixed by the Kia service center.

About the only major recommendation I would make to Kia would be to either make the rear seats much much lighter (because they are very heavy) or design them to be retractable like some of the competitors are starting to do.
