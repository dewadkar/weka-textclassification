            We have owned our 1992 Pontiac Grand Am for about a year and a half. We had a rough start during the first few months of ownership (details to follow) but it's been smooth sailing from then on. Brief description of our Grand Am: 1992 SE model (4 dr), auto, Quad4 engine, all power op's, cc, ac, tape player, 220,000+ miles-and still running strong!

 My husband and I have always been 'Ford People' and had to humble ourselves in order to trade our Ford pickup for this Pontiac! We had to make the trade for something with a back seat due to the need for more room that comes with having children. I have no regrets though. This is one tough little car. We have traveled up and down the East Coast with this car and have put over 30,000 miles on it since we purchased it. The gas mileage is impressive, averaging about 30+ mpg (highway) and doing equally as well in the city. I have always driven Mustangs with big V8's so nothing ever seemed to touch the acceleration I was used to but the Grand Am's Quad 4 engine pleasantly surprised me in it's ability to get up and go-especially on those steep inclines or when you need to merge onto the highway. (definitely not a racing machine but not your typical sluggish 4 cylinder either). As far as the roominess, I would consider it at or above average compared to other cars in its class. Leg room in the front is excellent however I can't say the same about the backseat-especially if you're on the taller side like me. I must say though that if you're toting your kids (and their carseats) around in the backseat, there's plenty of room. I have even been able to fit a smaller person in the middle of the carseats although it was a bit snug. 

I do love my Grand Am but nothing is perfect. During our second month of ownership, our car began to run very rough and overheated. After towing it to the Pontiac dealership and waiting for hours, we found that it had a blown head gasket. Apparently these engines are known for having this happen and I was told by an independent mechanic and friend just recently that these cars had a 'silent recall' issued because of it. (I cannot verify that statement-just hearsay). Fortunately there were no cracks in the head and though the repair was pricey it was worth it rather than salvaging a car which has proved to be completely trouble free since this bizarre incident. My only other complaint would have to be that just recently certain electrical components have been failing me , specifically the driver's side power window and the power side mirrors. Hardly affects how I feel about this sporty little vehicle. 

If you're looking for an economical, reasonably priced, durable ride, the Pontiac Grand Am is a sure bet!
