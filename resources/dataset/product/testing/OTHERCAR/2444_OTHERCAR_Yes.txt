            This nifty little camera may look simple, but it is packed with a load of cool things. It is not only a stand-alone still shot camera, it is a stand alone digital video camera, Web-Cam, Camera to VCR Video Recorder (or to review your pics on the big screen.

It provides a nice slick USB connection to the computer, and a video A/V plug for the back without the A of course. 

It has a 4x digital zoom, two modes for review, a 30.48mm x 
22.86 LCD screen on the back, and a veiw finder (saves power). It takes Only two AA bateries (Energizer or Duracell recommended if using the flash) It is not a cheap dimestore camera without a flash. 

It has a 16mb internal memory, expandable to a Secure Digital Card, for more Capacity that doesn't replace, but adds to the internal memory (if you have a 32mb card, the overall memory is 58mb). 

Don't be fooled by the quality settings, they are not really quality but size. Lo or * is 800x600, The other two are bigger. But the bigger the picture the bigger it's size, the less pics you can take, but it is all good anyway. 

On the internal memory the video time is 98 secs but it gets bigger with the cards, you must remember the expansion cards.

The amount of pics you can take depends on the quality (size) of the pic. (Figures below based on internal memory) 

Lo* = 113 pics
Std** = 29 pics
Hi*** = 18 pics.

So overall it is a great camera loaded with functions and very easy to use. 

OH YEAH TO WINDOWS XP USERS - YOU WILL GET THE NON-COMPATIBLE MESSAGE SAYING THAT THE DRIVER MAY NOT RUN UNDER WINDOWS XP. CONTINUE THE INSTALL ANYWAY I HAVE WINDOWS XP AND IT IS FINE, IT HAS BEEN TESTED FOR WINDOWS XP AND PASSES. DONT WORRY ABOUT THIS MESSAGE.
