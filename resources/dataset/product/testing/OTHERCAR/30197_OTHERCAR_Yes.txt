            We've owned quite a few car, trucks and minivans in the 10 years we've been together. This Dodge Caravan ES has been the best used automobile we've ever owned. After 130.000 miles this van is still going strong. We've had it for a little over a year now, and knock on wood, no major problems to speak of.  This van has made numerous trips to South Carolina, Florida, and Tenn.  It is also driven daily 30miles round trip to work.  The body is still in excellent condition as is the interior. I've had friends who've purchased brand new automobiles, that were not as well made and reliable as this van has been.  I would highly recommend <br><br>
