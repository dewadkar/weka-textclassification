            When I was looking for a new car back in 1999, the Alero was a new model. I had not considered on Oldsmobile before because I thought of the as an &quot;Old man's' car. And the Achieva was a joke. But my wife mentioned this car, so I took a look. I was pleasantly surprised. The car had a lot of standard features and was reasonably priced. The interior is very nice and the exterior looks like a mini Aurora. I purchased the GLS Sedan and added the sunroof, upgraded stereo, and the sport suspension. The car handles great, accelerates very well, and the brakes are nothing short of amazing. They have saved me several times from people pulling out in front of me and when highway traffic takes an unexpected turn. The traction control is nice too, especially with the Eagle RSA tires. The car is very quiet, accelerates smoothly with little torque steer and is comfortable on trips up to around 300 miles. About the only improvements I would like to see would be a bit more power, maybe 30 or so horsepower would make the car even better. Also, radio controls on the steering wheel would be nice. Anyone who needs a mid-sized family car with great looks and a good price should consider this car. I have received many compliments on it. most people can't believe it is an Oldsmobile. (Me neither). I like it better than the Grand Am, because it is subtle and refined, not a boy-racer. Honda and Toyota need to watch out for this car.<br><br>
