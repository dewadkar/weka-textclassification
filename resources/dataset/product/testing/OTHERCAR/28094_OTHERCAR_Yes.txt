            I bought this camera about 5 months ago, after having to develop 100 rolls of photos in one year. It was decently priced, I paid $233 total for it. It has very sharp clear pictures (1024 x 768  resolution), it takes excellent pictures outside, even in dark conditions. I have a few complaints though. One, when you are trying to take a picture where the subject is more than a 3-4 feet away the picture comes out very fuzzy and dark, even with the flash. There is a slider on the top of the camera that is supposed to enable you to switch from up-close to far away shots, and I've tried to take the same picture using both settings and found no difference between the two. The LCD display is great. I take a lot of pictures of my daughter and can't afford to have my eye up to a little eye-piece the whole time. It does drain batteries fairly quickly, the set of batteries it came with were used up within the first 2 hours I used to camera (about 40 pictures worth). I have solved that problem in two ways, If you don't use the LCD display and instead use the eye-hole to take pictures the battery life is about twice as long, and I bought a battery charger with 4 rechargeable batteries fairly cheap, and if at all possible I use the power cord that came with it. It has a nice carrying case, which the camera fits snugly into, so I don't worry so much about it sliding around in the case and getting damaged. It is small and light to carry, with batteries it weighs about 10 oz. which is fairly light. It fits in one hand which makes it easy for me to carry around other things. The software it came with was easy also, although it came with 2 different Photo Maker programs, I recommend the Pro program. It installed quickly and with no problems, the hook ups are easy to identify and easy to hook up the computer. The downloading/saving/deleting of the files is a fairly long process but you can do other things while it is doing so. Over all I highly recommend this product. The price and the quality are very good. Also it is fairly tough I dropped it and chipped a piece off of the top and it works fine.<br><br>
