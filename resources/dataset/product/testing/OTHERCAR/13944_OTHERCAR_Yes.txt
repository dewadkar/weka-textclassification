            My experience with the Subaru Outback Wagon has made me a new loyal Subaru owner.  I have a 1998 model and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I looked at many different cars before choosing this, including Saturn Wagon, Volkswagen Passat/Jetta/Golf, Hyundai Sonata, Honda Accord, etc. and nothing could really match what I found with the Subaru.

So what is it that's so great?  Well, I've noticed in many of the &quot;Auto Enthusiast&quot; magazines in the US that the Outback gets good reviews but the Accord, Jetta &amp; Passat seem to get more respect.  I think those cars deserve a tremendous amount of respect, as they are very good at what they do, but they DON'T do what this car does!

First of all, the all wheel drive is fantastic!  Once you get used to a regular car (I don't REALLY consider the Outback an SUV, but more on that later) with all-wheel drive it is difficult to drive one without.  For instance, I recently drove my mother's new Accord and was shocked when at a light I EASILY squealed the tires in the rain!  I NEVER feel ANY slipping of traction AT ALL in this car in the rain!  It is an extremely confident driving experience.  The handling is great too...I last had a Nissan Sentra SE-R with an upgraded sport suspension and this car, although it is  much larger, drives just as sporty.  Now, about that SUV thing: this is not a SUV...but I have gone off-roading with it and it does VERY well.  My wife and I camp a lot, and often choose out of the way places to camp, and the Outback gets us there every time.  I have driven through some conditions that I was very concerned that the car would not handle well, but it always surprises me...I've never been stuck and never &quot;bottomed out&quot; the suspension.  Of course, since it has a rather long overhang in back, you have to be careful going over particularly harry situations.

Next, the styling is very distinctive without being too quirky looking, as some of the older Subaru's were.  I live in the South, and there aren't very many of these around so I feel somewhat unique.  There is a ton of cargo space: I have moved tables, bookcases, dressers, a lawnmower, etc. with no problems.  The rear seats will fold all the way flat and the cargo space is shaped well (though the 2000 Outback's wheel wells encroach less into the cargo space).  

Negatives...not many, but the driver's seat seems to lack some back support on long trips.  Some of the controls (like the power windows) are not really placed very conveniently, but I'm used to them now.  The windows rattle when they are part way rolled down and you slam the door shut (irritating but minor).  There is a small place on the rear seat cushion where the stitching has come loose, but otherwise all fit and finish is excellent.  I'd like a little better gas mileage (I get about 20 around town and 26-29 on the highway--but then I drive with a heavy foot!).  The power of the flat-four engine is very good, but not fantastic.  This car would be great with a 6 cylinder.

Overall, I love this car and will definitely get another Subaru!!<br><br>
