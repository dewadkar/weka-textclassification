            This truck is a great truck to buy if you are in the market for a used truck.  If the previous owners have taken care of it like the should have this truck will not give you any problems.  I purchased mine about two years ago and the only money it has cost me is gas, oil changes, and tires. I could not ask for anything better.

Mine has the standard five speed transmission, 4 "regular gears" and one overdrive.  On the highway is ride very nicely and with the 4 cylinder in it makes pleny enough power to travel at the desired speeds and haul most desired weights.  

The bed is made with quality and will take many dings before showing any signs of wear. I race motocross, so every weekend I load it up and head to either the races or to a practice track.  It is so easy to load every thing in and I am always confindent that my truck will get me to and fro with out giving me any problems.  Though I really don't have any mechanic knowledge so I can;t break it down for every part I can say that in the two years and 45,000 miles that I have had this truck, it has run like a top. Never giving me any trouble at all, may I just be lucky? Purhaps, but I think that Dodge has built a quality truck here that will continue to run great with out giving me any trouble for a long time.
