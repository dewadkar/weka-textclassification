                 In October of 1998 i was looking to buy a newer car.  I was looking around a used car lot and came across a 96 MX-6.  It only had 22,000 miles on it and it was a limited production &quot;M Edition&quot;.  It is totally loaded, including, leather seats, sunroof, tape player with in dash 3 disc CD changer, spoiler, gold accents, V6 engine and a lot more.  After i test drover it i knew that i had to buy it.  
     Its now almost a year and a half later and i have never regretted buying my MX-6.  It has everything that i wanted in a car.  The V6 is one of the smoothest engines that i have ever seen.  I love having the 3 disc changer, and it is the only car like it around here.  Most of all, i cant get over how well it handles.  I can go around pretty sharp corners at high speeds and it sticks to the road like glue.
     There are only two things that i don't like about it, and they are only minor.  First, the speakers are 6x8's and there is not a big selection out there, but Pioneer does make them and they are quite good.  The other thing is that it does not have full frame windows so when i go through a car wash some water leaks through.
     I recommend this car to anyone that appreciates a great handling and good looking car with a sweet, smooth engine.  I am about 5'8&quot; and i don't think it would as comfortable for someone over 6'.  I plan on keeping this baby for awhile.
