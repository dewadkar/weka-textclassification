            Let me begin this review by saying that if you&#146re looking for technical specs, please go to the Subaru web site at www.subaru.com. Specs bore me. However, cup holder design is extremely important to me. I began my car shopping early in 2002 and quickly dismissed the 2002 Forester due to the silly cup holder design: it was positioned high on the dash directly over the stereo, so that any sudden stop or turn would probably mean the stereo is going to get wet. Pity, I thought, since the rest of the car seemed so practical, yet had so many cushy options and was reasonably priced. But I just couldn't bring myself to consider a car that had such a stupid design flaw.

I continued to shop, test driving the Honda CRV (nice but boring), Jeep Liberty (too plastic), Toyota Tacoma Double-Cab (great truck but a little too expensive for me), Ford Explorer (again, too expensive). I also looked at the Landrover Freelander, but found the seats so uncomfortable that I didn't even want to test drive it. Then one summer day my fiancï¿½ brought to my attention that the interior of the 2003 Forester had been redesigned. "Show me the cup holders!" I said. He found an interior photo at the Subaru web site and lo and behold, the cup holders were now on the center console, where they should be! I test drove one that day, and by the end of the week I owned a 2003 Forester 2.5 XS Premium. 

What else do I like about the 2003 Forester besides the damn cup holders? Lots. The Premium package gives you 16&#148 aluminum alloy wheels, leather covered steering wheel, shift handle & parking brake, 6-disc CD stereo & cassette, heated seats, 2 trip odometers, power windows, mirrors & locks, and of course, that huge sunroof as well as the roof rack, 2 power outlets, keyless entry, cruise control, automatic climate control, and lots of handy little storage compartments and more. I have to admit, even though I live in New England, heated seats were not on my list of &#147gotta haves&#148 but now that I have them, I&#146m spoiled forever. Some options that you should not think of as optional: cargo tray, bumper cover and splash guards.

What was I looking for in a vehicle? I need a vehicle rugged and versatile enough to carry kayaks, bikes and scuba equipment; to get me and said equipment into and out of sandy or rocky beachside locations. Other potential applications: camping, moving and dog-hauling. As a Bostonian, I also need a car that will be nimble and agile on the street and fast enough to keep up with the rest of the maniacs on the highway. The Forester fits all of my requirements nicely. I can easily dodge any idiot that gets too close while cutting me off in the city, and I have found myself more than once approaching 100 MPH on the highway without even noticing because the gas pedal isn&#146t even close to the floor. I&#146ve been camping and scuba diving with no complaints, and hopefully I&#146ll be shopping for a kayak soon. I can&#146t wait to put that roof-rack to use!

One of my few complaints is that if I do put the pedal to the floor, there is a slight hesitation before it responds, but I&#146ve found that to be common with most automatics. If you accelerate smoothly like most sane people, it performs very nicely. Another complaint is the parking problem. On my second day of ownership, I noticed that if I shut the car off immediately after putting it into Park, the wheels would not lock. However, if I wait a second or 2 until I feel the transmission lock into place before I shut it off, it&#146s fine. I have since received a notice in the mail from Subaru admitting this defect and announcing a recall. They say they will be ready to begin repairs in Jan. 2003. It doesn&#146t bother me too much, but I will definitely get it fixed. Other minor complaints: Gas mileage is definitely on the lower end of the advertised range (about 21 mpg); the wind noise from the roof rack is a little louder than I expected.
