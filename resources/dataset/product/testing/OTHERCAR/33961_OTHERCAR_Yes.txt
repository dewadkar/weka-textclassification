            I leased a Lincoln Continental because it has a good sleek look and was very affordable in the luxury car price ranges. The residual cost at the end of the lease was also very low which demonstrated that most of the payment was being applied to the principal balance. Ford also provided a extremely low interest rate in computing the lease payments. Holman Pines Lincoln Mercury dealership was very easy to work with and made the experience pleasurable. The car ride quite comfortable and has sufficient power to give you a good sense of safety when additional power is required. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for luxury and design and a good performer. <br><br>
