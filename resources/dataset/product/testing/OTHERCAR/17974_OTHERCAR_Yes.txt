                 When I was little I wanted a Jeep. I thought they were the coolest thing a boy could have and I convinced one day I would have my own. My parents thought otherwise. Especially when I became hit my teens. They pretty much said NO. 
     Well now I am 25 and have been the proud owner of my Jeep Wrangler for over a year. I had started researching prices through the internet about a year before I made my purchase, and let me tell you I saved myself about 3G's. (Thanks to Carpoint) In addition to the research, my father, who owns a Grand Cherokee, was invited to Jeep 101. This Jeep sponsored event offers Jeep owners a chance to see the real offroad capabilities of these incredible vehicles. After traversing a man made offroad obstacle course I was sold. 
     I had my Jeep made to order with all the options i was interested in. Speed control, overhead sound bar, fog lights w/heavy duty battery,30 inch wheels, add a trunk, cloth woven seats, dual top option where you get the hard and soft top together. Otherwise those tops are really expensive after market.  
     There are a plethora of other options including off-road axle ratios, ABS, A/C, traction control. I thought who needs A/C when the top comes down!? The standards included are dual air bags with the option to turn the passenger side off should you have a baby, standard center console(get the upgrade).
     6 Cylinders with 181hp give this small Sport Utility a good kick. I feels a bit torquey but that's a good thing, especially in off-road or inclimate weather conditions. Part time 4 wheel drive is easily engaged with the pull of a handle up to 55mph and believe me it works. I was traveling through PA and this rain storm came out of nowhere. I slowed to 50 mph and wham! 4 wheel drive. There is also 4WD low for slow offroad traveling, significantly increasing the torque. 
     Handling was better than I had anticipated. Taking corners in the wrangler has been improved by a wider wheelbase. Highway travel is surprisingly smooth and comfortable. I have taken a number of long distance trips and found the seats to be excellent for the ride. Around town driving can be a bit rough, you will get thrown around a bit but I found it kind of amusing. In the rain the car performs admirably and less than perfect in the snow. I found the Jeep felt a bit light in the snow. You could remedy this with some added weight under the rear seat. 
     Don't expect to get good gas mileage. I suggest the extra capacity fuel tank which give you 5 more gallons for a total of 19. I averaged 18-19 mpg highway and 16-17 in town. The soft top goes up and comes down easily, 5 to 10 minutes tops. The hard requires at least 2 people and I suggest if you have the room in your garage get a special pulley to put it on and take it off. It's just so darn bulky, although you'll be thankful you have it in the winter time. The add-a-trunk options offers little space but its a secure space for tools of things you are weary of leaving out in the open. 
     Overall I love my Jeep. I have had no maintenance problems. I change the oil every 3000 miles, keep an eye on her fluids and wash her religiously. The Wrangler has a 3 year 30,000 mile warranty and during that time Chrysler gives you 24hour roadside assistance, a nice plus offering towing and gas. If you're young or young at heart and looking for excitement on the road or off road I can't recommend the Wrangler enough. Take a test drive in the summer with the top down and you'll wee what I mean.
