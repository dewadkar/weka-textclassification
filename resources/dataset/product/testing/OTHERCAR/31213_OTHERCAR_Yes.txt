            I recently purchased a Jeep Liberty Limited with all of the bells and whistles about a month ago.  I have to say that it is the most solid driving vehicle that I'd had the pleasure of driving.  Before purchasing, I drove a Jeep Grand Cherokee, Toyota 4-runner, and a Mitsubishi Montero Sport.  I didn't even bother with a Toyota RAV 4 or vehicles like it.  ALL of these vehicles felt like cars in the steering system, which was loose with lots of play.  The Liberty felt just the opposite, very tight, yet very responsive.  The interior has generous headroom, which again, does not make it feel like a car.  I keep referring to this fact because if I wanted a car, I would buy a car. I was in the market for a true SUV.  The dash and dials are very modern, and the rear seat has a little more leg room than a Jeep Cherokee that I owned in the past.  I keep reading reviews about the poor acceleration in relation to its weight, about 4000lbs, but it performs exactly like I had expected. If I wanted speed, I would have bought a sports car. The rear door with automatic window has an interesting feature where you can open both with one hand at one time.  Great for my wife when she goes grocery shopping.  There is also a release located on the remote. The front end of the vehicle has a love it or hate it look, and the whole vehicle seems to be a cross between the Jeep Wrangler and the Grand Cherokee.  I didn't like it at first, but the style really grows on you, and I am extremely happy with the design. We have come to call it, the little tank, and at 4000lbs, it is capable of towing 5000lbs, which is perfect for my boat interests.  I recently read an article on the new Saturn SUV that is only capable of towing 1,000lbs without trailer brakes.  GIVE ME A BREAK!!!! If you are worried about roll, then don't buy an SUV!  This vehicle however does very well around tight corners at moderate speeds due to its suspension.  So not much worry there.  The interior sound at virtually all speeds is very muted, but still apparent.  Much better than the SUV's that I've driven.
If I had to site a few negatives, here is what they would be.  If you enjoy doing your own tune ups, the spark plugs are in a very tight place which will add an hour onto your tune up.  The rear tire that sits on the rear door does not move.  So if you want to wash or wax behind there, you need to take it off.  The back window does not roll down like on the Toyota 4-runner, but the opening feature mentioned before makes up for it. I recently heard that the Liberty did not do too well on a rear crash at 5 miles per hour in regard to repair cost.  That's if you plan on getting rear ended anytime in the near future. One last thing, I would have preferred it to be a little longer in the rear for more storage area.  After reading a few reviews, I now know that the length was done purposely to help it climb boulders and such in the off road areas.  None the less, I could have used just a little more space.
The Jeep Liberty is a TRUE SUV.  It was built that way from the ground up.  If you want to really know how well it performs off-road, just look up the Motor Trends or Car and Driver reviews.  That's just where they took it and had wonderful things to say.  But for those of you who remain in the city, it has nothing but a pleasurable driving experience for you.  I preferred the Limited to the Sport due to visual preference, but either one can come with all the goodies.  When you drive it once, you'll know what I'm talking about.  Chances are you'll be driving it home.
