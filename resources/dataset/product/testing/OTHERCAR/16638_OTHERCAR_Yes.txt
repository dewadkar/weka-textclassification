            Our 10 year old Civic CRX was finally starting to croak after 210,000 miles, so we were faced with the inevitable: Finding a new vehicle that would live up the character of our beloved little Honda. Mrs. RJ, the primary driver, wanted a hatchback, and eventually our choices narrowed down to Ford Focus ZX3 and Hyundai Tiburon. We both liked the ZX3, it was roomy and handled well, but checking out various consumer websites and the NHTSA web site ruled out the Ford; way too many technical problems and recalls. This left us with the Tiburon.

At first, we were leery about buying a Hyundai because of the reputation of the make. But the more we researched, the more impressed we were. There were hardly any negative comments to be found and the car came with a mind-boggling 5 year/60000 mile bumper-to-bumper manufacturer's warranty.
Our prejudices set aside, it was time for a test drive. The first Tib we tried out was a white 5-speed with leather interior. The car was blowing black smoke and smelled of burning oil. Nonetheless, the test drive was a blast, and we knew that Tiburon was the car for us. The leather interior was really tacky, and we felt leery about the oily smoke, so we didn't buy one that day. A couple of weeks later, we came back to the dealership, where we found a Super Silver 5-speed with no extras, just the way we wanted, and after a lengthy test drive, we wound up taking her home. Kudos to TRA Hyundai in Knoxville, TN, for making our car buying experience such a breeze.

INTERIOR: 8

Don't bother with leather interior. Although the leather seats look neat, they feel more like vinyl, and the "leather wrapped" steering wheel is like holding a chamois frisbee. The cloth seats, on the other hand, are really comfortable with snazzy red embroidery. 

Without a sunroof, there's easily enough space for a 6'2", 200 lbs driver. All controls are within easy reach. The dashboard is really cheesy looking, the supposedly-cool controls are like from a $50 Wal-Mart boom-box. The climate controls are hard to read but seem to work okay. Air recirculation is not adjustable, it's either on or off. The itty-bitty side mirrors are pathetic, and with the thick C-pillars make lane changes a real adventure. The rear view mirror shudders in motion so badly it's almost useless.

In both of the two Tiburons we tested, the steering wheel height adjust was extremely hard to operate, it took brute physical force to make the steering column budge.

The front bucket seats are very comfortable, but the back seat -- well, let's face it, the Tiburon is for all intents and purposes a two-seater. The cargo hold has ties for a baby seat, but other than that, the Tib is definetely not a family car. 

Aside from moderate amount of tire noise, the interior is pleasantly quiet even at highway speeds. It seems Hyundai has made quite a few improvements in sound insulation from the previous years' models.

EXTERIOR: 9

Some people don't like the Tib's styling, we love it. The 15" wheels make the car look smaller than it actually is. The factory default Michelin tires are of high quality and provide more than adequate grip. 

Paint and clear coat quality in our car was flawless, which was not the case in all the Tiburons we observed at the dealership. It seems that some cars that come in non-metallic flavors (black, red, white and yellow) suffer from uneven paintwork. Buyer beware. Our Tib had a weird "dent" in the sheetmetal above the left rear wheel, it's barely noticeable unless you compare it with the body paneling on the right side. The rear bumper fitting is so-and-so, but that seemed to be the general case in all Tiburons we saw at the dealership. Definetely not Toyota quality, but nothing sub-standard either.

The cargo hatch is well nigh impossible to close properly. Apparently, it's been a problem since the 1998 model year; you'd think Hyundai engineers would have already come up with a solution.

HANDLING: 9

The primary attribute of Tiburon is that it's so much fun to drive. It's not exactly a rocket, but the exhaust emits a low, agressive rumble that sends tingles down your spine as you accelerate and shift up, until you realize you're only going 40 mph... There's plenty of torque, however. You can shift to the 5th gear around 35 mph and never shift down until you're ready to stop. The 140 hp, 16 valve engine likes to be revved up, at typical highway speeds of 70-80 mph it runs around 3500-4000 rpm.

The 5-speed manual transmission in our car is kind of wishy washy. The throws are long and imprecise, which combined with insensitive clutch requires constant attention. You have to be careful when you throw in a gear in or you'll be greeted with plenty of grinding noise. But once you get used to the shifter, it poses no problems.

The suspension is, in a word, sweet. The Tiburon hugs the road like a sports car twice the price, no sway, no shudder. The car seems pretty impervious to high winds as well. When it comes the time to slow down, the four wheel disk brakes provide ample deceleration.

SUMMARY

So far, the car has lived up to our expectations. The performance and initial quality of the car matches well that of Ford Focus and even American-assembled Honda Civic. I wouldn't recommend it for someone dreaming of Acura Integra or Toyota Celica, but if you're looking for a small, sporty car that's fun to drive and care free to own w/ a superior manufacturer's warranty, Hyundai Tiburon provides excellent value for money.

1500 MILE UPDATE:

Not a single problem so far. Transmission clunkiness has all but disappeared (or it may just be we're gotten used to it). The dealership promised to fix the steering column height adjust problem at the 2500 mile service (which is free of charge, of course). Fuel consumption has been 28-30mpg, which is decent. We've had several people stop and ask about the Tiburon, and most have been shocked to hear we paid only $14k for it :)

7,500 MILE UPDATE:

Nothing remarkable to report. The Tib feels as solid as ever. Gas mileage has improved to 33-38 mpg (mixed city/highway). Funny enough, the car has retained it's "new car smell" which is very distinctive, but not unpleasant. Also, found out that the Tiburon can seat five adults in a pinch...

15,000 MILE UPDATE

No problems whatsoever. A great little car!

It seems Edmunds.com agrees with me, see the 2001 Huyndai Elantra road test at "http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/longterm/articles/46043/article.html"...

20,000 MILE UPDATE

The first problem: Left low beam headlight accumulates moisture inside. Will be replaced under warranty. The Tib finally lost it's "new car smell", a year after purchase :) Other than that, zero defects.

25,000 MILE UPDATE

No problems at all (except that now we want the new 2003 V6 Tiburon!!!).

32,000 MILE UPDATE

A small stone cracked the whole windshield, not covered under warranty. $400, ouch! The dealership would've charged $700 for the same job, though. Other than that, no problems at all.

38,000 MILE UPDATE

Nothing remarkable, the Tib is holding up great.

42,000 MILE UPDATE

Still no problems, running great.
