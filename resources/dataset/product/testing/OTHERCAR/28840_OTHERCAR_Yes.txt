            My wife has always been the type of person that take lots of pictures and more often than not never take the films to be developed. We then bought this camera a whole new world opened up for us. The pictures come out so clear, it's unreal! It comes with a re-usable memory card, so you don't have to buy films anymore. My father-in-law now gets to see a lot more of his grand-daughter with this camera. When my nephew was born I took pictures of him in the nursery and went home and immediately sent crispy clear pictures of him to relatives and friends around the world. 

This product is perfect to taking everywhere you go. <br><br>
