            I bought my 2000 Sable to replace an aging Honda Accord that had grown too small for my needs. While I miss the fuel economy of that Honda, I've not really looked back since taking delivery of my new vehicle.

The fit and finish of this car is exceptional. The design changes for 2000 really make it stand out from the previous body style (dubbed &quot;The Batmobile&quot; by a friend). I've actually had admirers stop me to ask questions about it and fawn over the design.

As I mentioned, fuel economy could be better. In this day of $2 gasoline, mid to high 20's in the MPG arena doesn't cut it. On the other hand, the included 200+ horsepower V6 zips quite nicely onto the freeway, so you have to figure that into the equation.

The ride is firm yet supple and the handling is very good. The leather interior is well crafted and seat comfort and legroom is more than adequate for my 6'6&quot; frame, both front and rear. The only strange omission is that, while the driver side seat is power adjustable, the passenger side seat is not. An unusual cost-cutting move by Ford that I didn't notice until I sat in the passenger seat one day.

A nice touch is the rear air conditioning vent. How many times have you sat in the back of a car on a hot day waiting for it to cool off? Well, if you don't know what I mean, ask your kids. They'll thank Ford for this addition.

The trunk area, while not exactly spacious, is entirely adequate for a weekend family excursion. If you need more room, both rear seats fold down.

After driving this car for 6,000 miles and six months I've had not a single trouble with my Sable. At around $20,000 this is a great family car and, dare I say it, the poor man's Lincoln. I highly recommend it.

<b>10k Mile Update</b>
I recently passed 10,000 miles on this car and am still extremely pleased.  Save for a punctured tire on the New Jersey Turnpike, I have not had any mechanical difficulties with this vehicle. It is just as reliable and comfortable as the day I purchased it. 

Having spent this much time and mileage in this car, I'm happy to report that I've not developed any new pet peeves about it. This is one of the best vehicles I've ever owned.<br><br>
