            I should note that this is my first digital camera and my technical knowledge about cameras is a bit limited. I walked into CompUsa all set to get one of the Sony DSC series cameras but this silver gem caught my eye. So I went on the web to find some reviews (right at the store - nice job CompUsa. They also threw in a free 32MB MMC/SD card) and could only find a few but they were all good so I went ahead and bought it.
Didn't regret a thing! While Iï¿½ve only had it a week it survived a whole weekend of night shots (all flash - close to 40 high-quality shots & a few minutes of looking at them on the LCD) with out a glitch. Came back home and with one touch and one click they were on my PC ready for uploading. (I have Win XP Pro by the way - no compatibility problems) Like all digital cameras it is a bit tough to take accurate night shots as you can only use the viewfinder which is a bit small but works well.
Pros-
--Menu navigation is a snap - allows you to easily delete a picture right after you take it which is very smart.
--I love being able to take three pictures in rapid succession - no wait time even for the flash!
--The thing even takes 30 seconds of video w/ sound
--The cradle/dock is a smart idea - charge and transfer pictures by just placing the camera in it - only drawback: portability; you can get a $30 MMC/SD reader for your PC though and tote and extra $25 battery if need be to solve that problem (the cradle is small enough to take on a week vacation however)
--I was pleasantly surprised at the image quality of a camera this size
--Speaking of size, it's small. Fits snugly in your pants pocket (not jeans) but perfect for a jacket or purse.
--'Power up' only takes 2 seconds (literally)
--Battery life is right up there with more expensive cameras
--It's relatively cheap and simply looks great.
Cons?
--No bells & whistles if you can call that a con. Advanced users will not be satisfied with the lack of 'picture tweaking' features. Purely a point-and-shoot camera.
--For some reason in XP you can't 'see' the camera unless you press the sync button on the cradle (activates the USB?)- then it pops up as a drive you can read and write to (so yes, if you have pictures you want to take with you simply drag and drop them into your camera)

OK,OK. Yes you can say I'm biased, not a bad thing to say about it, I know. But I wanted to at least write something because there are simply no other reviews out there! If I do encounter some problems I will be sure to post follow ups or send email to tave@beer.com.

Happy shopping!
