            The HP 435 is a great camera for the Point and Shoot photographer. For those wanting to get into the digital camera world without spending lots-o-bucks, this is a great camera to use. I have been using the camera for a while, and find it has some great features and a few quirks.
These are addressed in the Pros and Cons. 

Just a note &#150 the HP 435 has an auto off function &#150 so if you happen to stick the camera in your pocket and the lens door comes open, the camera will shut off after a minute or so. 
Batteries.  No digital camera is made to use regular batteries. Not going to happen. For the best results get a battery charger and the highest mAh rechargeable batteries you can find. I use a charger that works both on 112 V and in my car. 2 or 3 sets of batteries will keep you shooting all the time. 
Grainy shots. This happens in lower lighted areas where the flash won&#146t reach or work. 
The camera auto sets to 400 ISO. The shots are somewhat grainier at ISO 400 in moderate light. A comparison of 400 speed film and the 400 ISO digital image in a moderate light situation actually look the same &#150 except for the slightly grainer look of the digital camera. So for quality &#150 it is pretty much the same. 
Flash  The flash only works up to 10 feet. To me, this is a bit limiting, but it is not unusual for inexpensive point and shoot camera, either film.  It does shoot very well close up with the flash. The light censors do a good job of reducing the strobe for close-ups.
Night Shooting - the camera does a fantastic job of night shooting. Using a tripod and the camera's timer, I got a great shot of Mars when it was close. 

And.. you an print your photos direct to an HP printer - no PC necessary!

Overall, considering the $150.00 list price of the camera, the features and the 3.x mega pixel output, this is a great little camera.
