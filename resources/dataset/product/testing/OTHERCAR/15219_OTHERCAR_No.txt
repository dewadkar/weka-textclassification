            I absolutely loved my car until the engine quit.  I thought my case was just bad luck because I have always had good experience with Toyota cars.  After conducting some preliminary research, I have discovered that the problem is more widespread.  The engine sludge problems are not covered by the manufacturers warranty because the company attributes the problem to poor vehicle maintenance by the owner.  I would suggest prospective buyers seek out detailed information on this developing problem prior to making a final purchase decision.  When I did my research prior to purchasing this vehicle, I did not notice any bad reviews.  During my most recent research, there are numerous references to the problems.  The most recent reference was made by Vince Reynolds in an August 02, 2001 review of Honda versus Toyota minivans at the Epinions.com website.
