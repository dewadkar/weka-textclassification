            Being a MOPAR man, I usually don't have rave reviews of foreign vehicles.  The new Toyota Tundra TRD has completely changed my mind.  Though it doesn't feel like driving a full sized pickup, the Tundra offers everything a full size has and is much easier to park.  My main complaint with the Tundra is that the optional V8 engine can only be coupled with an automatic transmission at this point.  The fuel economy on this engine is comparable to other full size pickups.

The winding back roads of upstate New York were my proving grounds for this vehicle.  The truck held all the curves, even at high speeds, on the bumpy roads due to a great suspension.  There was very little body roll on lane changes, though this may be due in part to the newness of the suspension.  The acceleration of the line was excellent, but the vehicle did lose a little power in the mid ranges.

I did not actually sit in the backseat of this three door model, but it looked somewhat cramped.  One benefit to the backseat was under the seat storage.  The center console between the front two seats allows for additional storage.

Three years ago when I was shopping for my current truck, I completely ruled Toyota out of the running.  Searching now, however, the all-new Tundra is at the top of my list.<br><br>
