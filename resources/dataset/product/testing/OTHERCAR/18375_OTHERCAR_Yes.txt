                 After owning several old BMWs I wanted a brand new car. I wanted something fun. Something in a hatchback. Something affordable. I loved the looks of the car since it first came out. Read all the reviews I could find (all seemed positive). Then I took a test drive. Smile. Smile. Grin. Bought Car.
     I love everything about this car. The only thing I could ask for is a 6th gear ala the new Celica. After making 2 trips down the length of the East coast - one in a Jetta (97) and in a Tiburon (98) - the Tiburon won hands down for comfort. With 2 people and a LOT of luggage and the AC on the whole time we averaged 31-32mpg the whole trip. The car could have a little more power for passing (the 2000 has 13 more hp). One thing I am constantly amazed at (besides its looks and the attention it draws) is the overall sense of quality. Nothing feels cheap. Doors close firmly and feel solid. Even the switchs on the dash seem large and well-made. The only problems I had with the car (in 36,000 miles) were a computer glitch (the car sputtered once about every 2000 miles) and a defective fan belt (it slowly came apart at about 32,000 miles) - both fixed quickly and very politely under warranty.
      The Tiburon's handling is impeccable through turns - especially for FWD - with little or no pull/plow. The stock tires have excellent grip and are some of the best available. Overall the cars feels very balanced and well behaved. Attempts to get the tires to break loose through mild and tight turns and off-ramps result in the car happily zipping through and only breaking loose when thrown into the most extreme situations. The shifter (manual) is very tight and a bit notchy which gives a nice solid yet smooth feel to quick shifting. At high speeds (70-120) the car still feels solid and powerful. The engine and exhaust sounds blend together nicely with very low wind noise to accentuate the car's performance, not drown it out.
     If you're looking for an affordable, fun, different car, this is it. If you're single and only carry occasional passengers, its perfect. Its excellent for spirited city and highway driving. With the proper snow tires, it even fares well in snow.<br><br>
