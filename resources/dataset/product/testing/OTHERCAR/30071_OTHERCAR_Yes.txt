            Kodak DC-280
<b> CONS: </b>
- The battery life is pathetic. The battery power is used up after very few photos. <b>WORST THING ABOUT THIS CAMERA: BATTERIES It's hungry, very hungry! </b>
-It is hard to tell the quality of a shot just by looking in the led display or the view finder. The location of the LCD screen is in an awkward place - normally where you place your left thumb when shooting 
- Some lag time on shutter release, at least it doesn't shut off during download
- Software package is terrible. It installs easily, but the poor documentation. The software needs a lot of improvement, it's not user friendly and crashes my computer now and then... 
-No usb support for windows 2000&quot;  

<b> PROS</b>
-One of the most amazing surprises was the ability to take indoor pictures with NO FLASH! Even in poor light I was able to capture high quality images. 
-Works great with WinME!
