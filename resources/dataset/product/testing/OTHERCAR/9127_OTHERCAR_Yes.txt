            *NOTE*   Since no reviews were posted presently on this vehicle, I had to place the review under the Lincoln Navigator SUV.  Why?  Because the frame of the Navigator SUV is similar to than that of the Blackwood's.
   
    
        I was in an auto show when it all happened.  As i glanced around the section of new FORD vehicles, i noticed hundreds of people gathering around some vehicle.  &quot;Probably another stupid SUV,&quot; I thought to myself.  But oh, how wrong I was.  I arrived at this automobile, staring at it for a solid five minutes.  It was, as I later figured out, a Lincoln.  I couldn't believe it.  A Lincoln?  No.  Couldn't be.  But it was.  The outside - wide, muscular, tall, just downright mean.  I managed to slip my way past the crowd and take a seat inside of it.  Did I say this didn't seem like a Lincoln?  Well, inside, it definitely did.  I could say the interior mimicked the limousine-like qualities of the Lincoln Town Car Executive Series.  Observing every inch of the auto, inside and out, I still couldn't tell what it was.  What the hell is this thing?  A truck?  An SUV?  A luxury sedan?  All three?  to this day, I still do not know.  I can only guess what it is.

        In short, the Lincoln Blackwood is a luxury pickup truck.  It is based on the popular Lincoln Navigator SUV, except for the fact that it is three inches lower, and that it has a relatively short pickup bed in the rear.  The Blackwood was designed to �take luxury into another level�, and is known as the �ultimate utility vehicle�, with all the comfort and convenience of a luxury sedan and the versatility of a sport utility/pickup truck.  Lincoln figured the vehicle would be popular, believing customers would appreciate the fact that it is a 3-in-1 automobile (SUV, pickup, luxury sedan).
	A 300 HP, 5.4L OHC (overhead cam) V-8 engine supplies the needed power for today�s customers demanding performance.  Who would have thought a pickup truck could go from 0-60 in 8.5 seconds?  Add to that the fact that it is also a luxury sedan/SUV, and you�ve got yourself a real performer.  Massive 19-inch, solid cast, polished aluminum wheels are fitted with special P286R60-19 tires that enable one to stay under control when turning corners at fast speeds (after all, it does have a 300HP engine, more than two times as much HP than your average car; it goes fast!)  The only drawback to a powerful engine like this is the fact that it gets awful gas mileage.  But if you are the type of person that can afford a $43,000 car, then you don�t have to worry about paying more for gas, right?
	The Blackwood has all the comfort and convenience you�d expect from a Lincoln.  A plush, leather interior on the doors, seats, and steering wheel make you feel like you are living in the lap of luxury.  Walnut wood trim is appliqued on all four doors, and also, the steering wheel.  I fail to understand why the majority of luxury car companies grace the steering wheel with wood.  The super-glossy surface from all that polish makes the wheel slippery, and hard to turn.  It would be simple to wrap it all in leather.  The pickup, on the other hand, has enough room to accommodate four adults comfortably.  A feature becoming more and more popular in today�s new cars is power adjustable pedals, allowing shorter drivers to adjust the height of both the brake and accelerator.  This simple idea solves the problem of manually controlling the seat to suit the drivers needs.  Other standard features include traction control, power folding mirrors, memory seats, rear Load Leveling Suspension (levels when carrying heavy loads), and many others, too many for me to list on this page.
	The Blackwood is basically a Navigator, except for the fact that it has a pickup bed where the Navigator�s enclosed trunk space is located.  The 4x8 bed has a hard top, which can be hydraulically opened to a 45-degree angle.  Once the cover has lifted, the rear double door gate can be opened to the sides, giving complete access to the well-lit, aluminum finished interior of the trunk.  On the exterior of the trunk, twenty square feet of Wenge Wood, a dark, dense wood from central Africa, is applied.  A clear epoxy not only protects it but also highlights the natural beauty of the grain.  Remember those �Woody� station wagons of the 70�s? Well, that�s what the wood looks like.  Fake.  Except that it is supposedly real, and that it has more of a shine to it than fake wood.  The 4x8 foot trunk is useful for things like carrying golf clubs and grocery bags.  It is quite shallow, however.  Fortunately, the hydraulics open quickly enough so drivers don�t need to wait long for putting something small in the bed.
	The old Lincolns of the past are only a mere memory.  Lincoln has changed, and the Blackwood is evidence to prove so.  Oh, how I miss those big block V-8�s and the stylish exteriors.  I just can�t imagine myself driving one of these, well, �things�, despite some good qualities the truck has, like power and a lot of luxury.  They are so sophisticated I cannot even classify them.  But, ultimately, just like animals, cars, too, �evolve�, or change.  And Lincoln was brave enough to step out of the crowd and come up with such an automobile-one to suit the lifestyles of everyday people.  I praise Lincoln for this.  Even though the Blackwood may not be such a big hit at all, I am still glad one good quality about Lincoln remains.  Even though the outside of a Lincoln car will change, the true heart and soul of a Lincoln will never change.  And that is to impress.

 
    Nice touches:       The front bucket seats.
   			Firm on the lower back
 			for added support, and
			soft on the bottom.  
			Also, a button, when 
			pressed, controls how 
			firm or soft you like
			your seat.  I usually
			don�t like leather, but
			this is quite comfortable.

  	Annoyances:     The wood trim on the
			steering wheel.  Wrap
			it all in leather.

			The separate button for
			cruise control.  All of 
			the radio controls and
			climate controls are 
			located on the steering
			wheel, whereas the 
			button for cruise control
			is located in the lower 
			left corner of the dash, 
			making it difficult to 
			reach.
