            JUST A WARNING TO ANY ONE THINKING OF BUYING A DODGE OR CHRYSLER MINI VAN WHICH WAS MADE IN THE 90S. BE PREPARED TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION REBUILT OR REPLACED. I HAVE HAD A 1989 CARAVAN AND ALSO A 1994 TOWN AND COUNTRY. BOTH HAVE HAD THE TRANSMISSIONS REBUILT. I AM TOLD BY THE TRANSMISSION SHOP MECHANICS THAT ALL YOU CAN EXPECT TO GET FROM THE TOWN AND COUNTRY IS 70,000 MILES. JUDGING FROM MY EXPERIENCES THAT ADVICE IS VERY ACCURATE. THIS IS A WELL KNOWN FACT AMONG MECHANICS AND ALSO DODGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE SINCE CORRECTED THE PROBLEM ON NEWER VANS.THE ENGINE IS ANOTHER STORY  THE 3.6 ENGINE IS EXCELLENT AND CAN EASILY GO OVER 200,000 MILES . I RECENTLY HAD MY TRANSMISSION ON THE 1994 TOWN AND COUNTRY DONE AND IT COST ME $2100 BECAUSE IT IS AN ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION. HAVING SAID THAT THE CAR HAS HAD NO OTHER PROBLEMS AND THE MOTOR HAS 170,000 MILES ON IT AND IT RUNS LIKE A NEW MOTOR.  WELL JUST WANTED TO ALERT YOU TO THE TRANSMISSION PROBS
