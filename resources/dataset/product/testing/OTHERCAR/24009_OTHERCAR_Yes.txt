            I bought a 1992 Honda Accord LX a year and a half ago and I absolutely love my car. I've had almost no problems with the car. The only problem I experienced was the timing belt broke, but it was a cheap repair. It gets good gas mileage, has great acceleration, roomy and comfortable interior, and it drives almost like a luxury/performance car. 

I still wash it every weekend and baby it even after 1.5 years! Can you say that about your car?
