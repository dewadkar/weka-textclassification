            Let me preface this review by telling you all I have only had the car three (3) weeks and will update this review in more detail once I have owned the vehicle a longer period of time.

A little bit too conservative on styling for my personal tastes but still a pleasure to look at and drive.  My car's pearl paint finish is beautiful and has held up very well for a car 12 yrs. old. The leather seating is very comfortable and has withstood the years of use and abuse and sun exposure very well!  The leather actually has faired much better than that in my '93 Lexus SC400.  I put Xenon lamps in my car and it gives it an updated appearance and draws more attention to the car.

I hate the automatic seat belts with a passion but tolerate them since I was fortunate enough to buy a G20 with the 5-speed transmission; Thank God!  The second and third gears in this car are wonderful and will take you right to the verge of 100mph with no problems.  I personally love being able to push a car to the verge of 8000rpm red line.  There is ample enough room to carry a couple friends with me in the back of the car and I think the trunk is admirable considering the overall size of this car.

The stock stereo was a piece of crap without CD and the speakers were completely shot when I bought the car.  I put an Alpine system in the car with Boston speakers.  Sounds pretty good, but I am disappointed that the speakers are 4 x 6 's in the front and I believe that the car has an amplifier in it somewhere that sends more power to the rear speakers.  I have the speakers turned nearly to the front and they are still way over-powered by the rears which throws the harmonics all out of whack.  My air conditioning still works and actually makes it cold enough to hang meat after a recent recharge.  Unfortunately, this year of car utilizes the less environmentally friendly refrigerant.

Word for the wise, watch for pinching and wear of the wiring along the inside edge of the trunk.  When the trunk closes the control arms close down and pinch the wiring for the rear lights, rear defogger and thinks such as the the rear speakers and trunk lights.  I rewired mine and taped it really well with electrical tape to try and prevent it from happening again over time.

I fully expect that this car will easily make it to 200K miles and hopefully beyond.  If my friend's Honda Civic can do it, then I believe whole-heartedly, that the G20 will do it as well.
