            We purchased this product to replace our casio digital camera.  After researching the camera's for a very long time, we were off to purchase the Sony MVC-FD91.

Having our own business, we do alot of presentations, quotes, etc. So, we needed a camera that could take a high quality picture.  We also travel a great deal, so we needed something that could take nice pictures of where we have been, what we have seen, etc.  This camera was the best choice for what we needed/wanted.

The reasons we chose this camera?  The 14X zoom, floppy disk storage, MPEG capabilities, rechargable battery, resolution of the pictures, built in flash, and the camera is simple to use.
