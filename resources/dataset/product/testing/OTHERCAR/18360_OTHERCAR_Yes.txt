            We just purchased a 1999 Mercury Villager and I love it! We had a Lincoln Town Car, but with the snowy weather this year decided that a front wheel drive vehicle was more practical. We found a 1999 Mercury Villager Estate that was loaded with options and seemed to fill our needs in a vehicle.
We were right! This Villager is a pleasure to drive. It handles like a car not a bulky minivan. We also have a Ford Windstar, which we also like very much, and it handles quite differently! The suspension on the Villager is much better too! It rides very smoothly!
The stereo/CD package is wonderful! The sound is good for a factory stereo and the CD 6 disc changer is located in the front of the passenger area, not in the trunk. In many other vehicles the CD changer will be located in a non-convenient place for the driver or front passenger to access. We are also fortunate to have separate rear headphone jacks so the children are able to listen to a CD or tape if the adults want to hear the radio.
There is not a lot of space to haul items in the very back of the van, but I can fit a stroller and a couple bags of groceries in without having to move the third seat front. The two rear bucket seats fold down and expose cup holders for the third seat. There are also cup holders for the two rear bucket seats located between the seats.
Overall, I would highly recommend the Mercury Villager, but make sure you get as may options as possible. The options definitely upgrade the vehicle from a nice mini-van to a dream mini-van!
