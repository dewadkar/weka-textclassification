            The new 325i finally gets the engine size matched up with the nomenclature, and adds a few more hp in the process, but its not the car for everyone, and specifically, not for me.   The BMW 3 series is probably the best driving car in its class, its safe for its size, and everyone seems to love them.  So why won't I buy one? 

First, I like a somewhat bigger car for my $36,000.  When you realize that the 325 is classified as a subcompact, is out-accelerated by many cars close to half the price, and isn't bulletproof reliable, you start to wonder if you're getting your money's worth.  I also prefer a larger car for safety reasons.  Yes, the BMW 325 is a very safe car, but at around 3200 lbs, it may not fare as well against heavy vehicles as a 3,800 lb car.   More leg, head, and shoulder room also would be nice.   

To tell the truth, there aren't many comparable big cars available for the price.  For that reason, I would choose a used bigger car over a new 325i.  

That said, the BMW 325i is a technological marvel.  Some of the technological advances in the 3 series are:

1. A new (and rare in this class) side head protection airbag system. This does a great job of keeping your head from smacking the window if you are hit from the side. It will soon be mandatory on all vehicles.

2. Vehicle skid control. This brakes each wheel individually to correct
you if you take a turn too fast or otherwise loose traction.

3. variable camshaft timing to give good low end and high rev performance (double VANOS)

4. A slick 5 speed automatic with manual shifting ability. This is fun to do, yet you don't get the problems in traffic which a traditional manual gives you. The 5 gears also really improve performance. The 325i isn't a high horsepower vehicle, yet it really moves well.  The 5 speed manual is also well-respected, and is more fun to drive for those with strong thigh muscles and commutes w/o any traffic to deal with.

5. A neat programmable key system. It serves as a passive antitheft device (the code has to match or it doesn't start), it can remember your seat and stereo settings, and various other "gadget" functions.



The BMW 3 series combines a surprisingly quiet and smooth ride with excellent handling capabilities, especially with the optional sport package. It isn't a sports car, per se, but it is as close as you can get in this price range and still have 4 doors. The interior is refined, useful, and comfortable. The steering wheel doesn't tilt far enough down for my tastes, for some reason, however. Storage is at a premium (a result of its size limitations), but the cupholders work well and I just toss stuff in the back seat that is too big for the tiny compartments up front.

The free maintenance-for-3 years program is a real plus. The 4 year, 50,000 mile warranty also make owning a BMW cost and worry free for several years into its life.  One warning about BMW service, though.  Here in Atlanta, it isn't easy to get a quick service appointment.  So, if you don't have access to alternative transportation, think twice before buying.  I was quoted a 3 week wait the last time I had to have warranty work done on my BMW.  Luckily, my wife knew someone who knew the scheduler at a dealership, and we got right in.   But you may not be so lucky.  My BMW experience has been that the major things work fine, but that they do have a lot of little problems that still require time and money to fix.  For this price, I expect better quality.

This current BMW is best in class for those who want safety, performance, and a little luxury in an affordable (barely) package. They should want to be a little different than the camry and accord drivers out there, though those are a better value for the money. For my money, the 325i is the 3 series model to buy. The 330i is about $5000 more, and the performance is more than adequate with the smaller engine, at least for me.  I just can't see how bigger brakes and half a second better 0-60 times are worth $5000.

CONS of this vehicle are its relatively small size, relative lack of rear seat room and trunk space, and the fact that people may assume you're the stereotypical arrogant BMW driver. Currently the 3 series is HOT on dealer lots, and you may find that for non-sporting drivers, a used 528i is a better fit, as well as investment. A well appointed 325i drives out (tax, title, etc) for around $36,000. New models by makers like Acura ( CL or TL type S ) are faster, more spacious, approach its handling ability, and are probably more reliable....for less money. No, they aren't as good, but they come close enough for the money.  But the 3 series looks great and is hard to beat in the "fun to drive" category.  I think the 3 series looks a little toylike from some angles, but they are handsome.

I like the 325i, especially with the sport and premium packages.   I just don't think it's a good value.  And the 330i, though a really fun car, is very overpriced.  You have to realize that Honda makes a very nice Accord that runs about $13,000 less.  No, I wouldn't have an Accord either, and it's not the same kind of car, but it does show how it is possible to make a good quality car for much less money.  I think that when the economy softens, BMW will be forced to sell their cars at more realistic prices.  For someone who is set on a smaller car, the BMW is hard to beat.  I would suggest equipping a 325i with the sport package and nothing else.  You'd have a nice, though slightly less luxurious car, for about $31,000.  The 325i makes a lot more sense at that price.
