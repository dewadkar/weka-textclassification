            I bought the rodeo last year based on positive reviews l had read. It is a nice looking vehicle, powerful and reasonably priced. I now wish l had bought something else.  The air conditioning has failed three times. The service department did fix each time. At their leisure l might add. Never mind it was 105 degrees here in Texas. 
 Now there has developed another problem. There is nice puff of smoke upon start up in the morning.  With  15,000 miles on the thing.
 I`m looking at buying a xterra or a four runner. I currently own a Nissan l bought new in 89 and it has never been in the shop. Never had a problem with it. So if the xterra is built anything like it l would happy to buy one. As to the four runner , Toyota quality is legendary.
