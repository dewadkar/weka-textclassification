            I bought this camera new for ten bucks.  I figured for the price, even if it did disappoint I couldn't go wrong for taking basic pictures.

Obviously by looking at the price point, you're not going to get a lot out of this camera.  It's not even USB - needs a serial port (which most PC's have) to upload pics.  It has three buttons - on/off, shutter, and timed shutter.

It does work, and the resolution isn't so terrible, the only problem is that the camera needs lots and lots of light.  There's no flash, so you practically need a flashlight or spotlight on your subject in order for the pic to come out.

If you want to throwaway a few bucks on a cheap toy, by all means it's fun to play with and low risk.  But if you want to take pics of friends and have a camera for use in practical situations, save your money and spend a few dollars more.
