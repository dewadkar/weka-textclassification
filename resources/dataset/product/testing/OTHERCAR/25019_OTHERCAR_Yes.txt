            We got our Voyager after my third child was born. I traded in a 88 two door, broken down T-Bird that I had owned for 11 years. I was very apprehensive about buying a van. I didn't like the &quot;domestic&quot; look. Well needless to say, &quot;domestic&quot; must be my bag. The Voyager is roomy, stylish and very easy to handle. On long trips to visit relatives, there is plenty of room for an adult to stretch out either in front or in back. Also, since I have three kids, on trips the back storage area is extremely roomy for each of their luggage. Plus there is even more room to store under the back seat. If I had to choose another van, I would definitely choose a Plymouth.<br><br>
