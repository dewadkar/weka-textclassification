                   I own a 1997 Buick Regal LS with 52,000 miles.  It is sky blue, a color that I rarely ever see on a Regal.  I bought it used about a year ago and have had no trouble out of it except for new brakes and an alignment  
       I really enjoy driving my car.  It has been very dependable.  There are many things I like about this car- such as power everything, a great stereo-CD/Tape/Radio with steering wheel controls, dual air bags, automatic dimming mirror, fog lamps, digital driver information center, a smooth quiet ride, very comfortable seats, and a strong engine.  There are only a few things I don't like about it- not very good gas mileage, keyless entry transmitter doesn't reach very far, and there is no button inside the car that will open the trunk.  I have to use the button on the keyless entry transmitter, which can sometimes be quite annoying.  
     It has great styling.  I have the 3.8 Liter V-6, 
non-supercharged.  The supercharged engine is only available for the Regal GS.  The engine is very quick, and has alot of kick to it.  It gets up to speed in no time, although it seems really bulky and heavy from a start, compared to my son's Dodge Intrepid.  One other thing I like is that there is no antenna- it is embedded into the back window, so it can't be damaged in car wash and cuts down on road noise.
     I would highly recommend this car to anyone.
