                 Even though I do not own my own Celica yet, my friend just bought one.  His car is outstandingly fast when you rev it to redline.  The acceleration is perfect and just shoots you back into your seat.  But beware, it will make your head hit the seat a couple of times before you realize the power behind this 1.8 L monster.  The engine sounds great when you rev it up.  This car is perfect for the younger generation, but if your an adult and have some type R blood like I do, a 2000 celica is the car for you!  Everyone is saying how small the back seats are.  Their aren't!!  I am 5'10&quot; and i fit in the back seat perfectly.  My knees don't even touch the back of the front seat and my head doesn't even touch the top.  Even with my 1-2 inch spikey hair, the back seats are for everyone.  The speedometers and gauges are so easy to read with the redish orange tint to them.  The system just begs to be turned up loader.  You may be asking what is bad about this car.  Well truly, there isn't much.  One minor thing is the door cannot keep open.  You would have to prop your leg on the side of the door to prevent it from closing.  
     You think you won't get girls with this car??  Oh hell yeah you will.  Its like a new face at a school, everyone will notice you!  As for cops, lets see them catch up hehe.  Well yeah thats all.  The celica is an overall great race car at a good price.  Be ready to bump your music, and say &quot;you wanna race.&quot; hehe<br><br>
