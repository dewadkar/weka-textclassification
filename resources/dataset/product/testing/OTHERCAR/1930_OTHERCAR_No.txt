            I think I made the biggest business/worse decision for the next 3 and some years. I recently leased this 2000 Maxima and I noticed that the car does not produce all the functions well that the dealer told me it would handle with out a problem. I have the 2000 GLE, the most expensive out of the 3 models (GLE,SE,GXE). This thing is costing me 370 US dollars a month that�s including tax. The price may vary for most leases, it all depends on the dealer. I chose this car because it was considered to be fast with its 220hp (horsepower) and fuel efficient with its 3-litter engine. It may be fuel-efficient but it is definitely not fast. It takes me a good while to accelerate to 40 mph, I would say 5 and some seconds, that being keeping the engine under 3.5 thousand rpm-s. I figured that all this horsepower has went into pulling the car its self, because you can tell that the car is really heavy. Much heavier than it�s predecessor the 95-99 Maxima, which was equipped with only 190 hp and the same 3-litter engine.  The 2000 Maxima is designed really bad, the car is lifted higher up like and SUV and that is why it takes the car a while to slow down, because after you hit 60mph good luck stopping. Since the car is higher up it loses torque.The Bose stereo is another disappointment. The acoustic setting of the car is really well build but the stereo system does not perform the way it should. Since the carmaker wanted to have surround sound they made the car more hollow inside. You can tell that the sound of your voice resonates all over the car, but it tents to thin out the tone of your voice and that�s exactly what it does to the bass of the Bose system. In the 2000 GLE you can�t feel the bass, what is the point of buying a rich quality stereo that does not have any bass. The official Nissan site (www.nissan-use.com) says that this car is �49% Performance, 49% Luxury, 2% Secret Sauce�, well I don�t see the performance nor the luxury, so I am just counting on the �secret sauce� for the next 3 years that I will be leasing the car. And, it looks like I�m basically paying 370 a month for really nice leather.<br><br>
