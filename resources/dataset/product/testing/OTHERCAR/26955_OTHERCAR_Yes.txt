            <b>After reading a recent <i>Car and Driver</i> comparison that favored the Mitsubishi Galant over the Honda Accord, I was curious enough to compare the two myself. Comparisons are often very helpful to determine which car to buy, as opposed to reading about one individually. I hope you enjoy the following format. Whether you do or don�t, <i>write me a comment </i>below!</b>
*****************************
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to this evening�s main event! Tonight, the Honda Accord EX V6 and the Mitsubishi Galant GTZ will square off! Who will be our champion?

BOB: Well Chuck, this should be a great fight. The Honda Accord is at the top of many lists, and has won the hearts of many people. 

CHUCK: Yep, but the Mitsubishi Galant has really been transformed to give the Accord a run for its money. Hey- we wouldn�t do this comparison if we didn�t think so! Let�s get started:

<b>[EXTERIOR:  Mitsubishi Galant]</b>

BOB: I tell you what, Chuck. The Honda Accord is an attractive vehicle, but it doesn�t want me to get in and drive it as much as the Mitsubishi Galant does.

CHUCK: Good call, Bob. Some sources say it seems like the Galant borrowed its styling from BMW, and I think that�s a fair statement. It looks real macho and yet sophisticated. The Accord only provides the latter of those two.

<b>[INTERIOR:  Honda Accord]</b>

BOB: What can I say, Chuck? When it comes to interiors, no one does it like Honda. The Accord�s dash is nicely laid out, with easy-to-use functions. The Galant�s dash is an improvement over past models, but still has smaller radio buttons and not as smart a layout. The Accord�s materials feel like they are higher quality. The buttons feel substantial, as if they were from a more expensive car. 

CHUCK: That�s true. I also noticed that the Galant is not as roomy or comfy as the Accord. And another thing: where are the grab handles on the Galant? The Accord's got 'em. Mitsubishi should take note. We favored the Galant�s sound system out of the two, but it�s all the other �little somethings� that made us pick the Accord�s interior over the Galant�s. It�s plainly superior. Period.

<b>[ENGINE: Mitsubishi Galant]</b>

BOB: This one was a bit close, but we liked the Galant�s engine better, and here�s why: the Galant is 5 hp shy of the Accord (195 vs. 200 both @ 5500rpms), but it weighs less and has 10 more pound-feet of torque than the Accord, and at lower revs. The result is an engine that is every bit as refined as the Accord�s, only stronger.

CHUCK: I did find the Galant a little too hasty to downshift, but that�s okay. I agree. The Galant has the Accord�s number on this one. And it�s quiet, too. Something that really surprised me. It accelerated very well with very little complaining at all. The Accord�s made a bit of a fuss when pushed hard.

<b>[RIDE: Honda Accord, by a nose!]</b>

BOB: It doesn�t seem like either car is willing to lose ground in this contest, does it? Well, as far as the ride is concerned, the Accord barely edged out the Galant. Its suspension was a little firmer than we would have liked, but it took bumps extremely well. There is hardly any rebound bump even when taking a ditch at high speeds. We took the same ditch with the Galant and it bottomed out. 

CHUCK: I agree. But this category could have gone either way. The Galant�s suspension is cushier than the Accord�s, making it a better highway cruiser. In fact, its engine was quieter than the Accord�s. But it just didn�t feel as solid- a very important point in our book. And let�s not forget the Grade Logic system found on the Accord. It detects the grades of the terrain to see which gear it should be in, so you don�t have to ride your brakes going downhill.

<b>[HANDLING: Mitsubishi Galant]</b>

BOB: We feel that Honda could tweak the handling of the Accord a bit. The Galant takes curves without a care in the world. It�s no Ferrari, but I would be more comfortable making emergency maneuvers in the Galant than in the Accord.

CHUCK: I guess that�s all we can say about that. Remember that we were driving the GTZ model, which gave it a tighter suspension made for sportier handling. Still, Car &amp; Driver rated the base Galant the highest in emergency turning.

<b>[RELIABILITY: Honda Accord]</b>

BOB: Duh! This is an ACCORD we�re talking about here. Bulletproof reliability.

CHUCK: While the Galant is only average. It has a better warranty, but I�d rather have a worse warranty for something that�s guaranteed to last longer.

<b>[VALUE: Honda Accord]</b>

BOB: This one was tough, but after extensive thought, we had to give it to Honda. Yes, the Accord has fewer features than the Galant. It costs more, and doesn�t even offer any incentives or rebates. But here�s the way we see it: the Accord will cost you almost nothing outside of routine maintenance. The Galant just might. As we said, reliability is average, so you�ll never know.

CHUCK: The main decider for us, however, was that the Accord actually RETAINS its value so well: it is still worth 56% of what you paid for it after five years. To illustrate, the Toyota Camry is listed at 55%. That�s really something. We�ve seen 1999 Galants out there for sale already marked down a LOT from their original sticker price. 

<b>[IT�S A PHOTOFINISH! Winner: Honda Accord�?]</b>

BOB: Man, this has to be the closest comparison I have seen yet. The Accord won this one 4 to 3, but it�s not as cut-and-dry as it seems. Let me explain it to you� if I was to be buying the car for ME, I would choose the Mitsubishi Galant. It�s just more fun. It looks better, and is more fun to drive.

CHUCK: But since we are making an intelligent, �professional� recommendation to you, we feel that the Honda Accord is a better &quot;all-arounder&quot; and thus the safer suggestion- especially for those with families. (For instance, the Accord V6 models all come standard with side impact airbags.) I�d say that the Galant is better for enthusiasts who throw caution into the wind and say �practical is boring!� Those with families or people seeking reliable transportation should go for the Accord, which has once again been placed as one of Car and Driver's 10 Best Cars. The Galant did not make this list despite the fact it won in a comparison. So, the choice is yours.
Well, that does it for us! Good luck and happy driving!

BOB: Join us next time as we pit the Ferrari 360 Modena against the Fisher Price Big Wheel!
