            After testing driving and comparing the Audi A4, Nissan Maxima, Volkwagen Passat and the Saab 9.3 the Saab was a clear winner.  The car had all of the features and handling that you would expect from a much more expensive car.  My decision to lease was very simple.  At $259/ month with no money down, it was a much better deal than any other car in its class.  After driving the car for a year, I have decided that this is a car you wont get bored with.  It is spirited when you want it to be and is a comfortable car on the highway for the long trips.  It has plenty of trunk space and a roomy interior.  The controls are well placed and the stereo controls on the steering wheel are an added benefit, especially if you choose the standard.  

I have owned many cars over the years and overall this is the best overall car taking everything into consideration.  <br><br>
