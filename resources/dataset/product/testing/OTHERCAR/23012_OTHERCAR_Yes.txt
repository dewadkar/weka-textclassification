            My family and I have been looking for a digital camera for quite some time but refrained from purchasing one because of the cost. I bought the Polaroid PhotoMax 640 the day after Thanksgiving at a sale price and took it straight home for a test drive. Upon reading the instructions for the software I realized that I needed a SmartMedia reader at a cost of around $80.00. This was disappointing since most of the digital market is supported by Macintosh. The editing software also does not support Macintosh requiring the use of a third party graphic editing program. Fortunately my family has Adobe Photoshop which works wonderfully. A call to Polaroid confirms that they are working on a Macintosh solution. No ETA on this solution. It was very easy to understand the workings of the camera and I was thrilled at the beautiful pictures it took. You can edit your photos however you like and change them also with airbrush, adding color, changing the background, and even adding special effects! This is a wonderful camera for the beginner because you can see the photo you just took on back of the camera and decide wether to keep and lock it in or delete. I highly recommend the PhotoMax 640! <br><br>
