            I bought my 1993 Mazda B2200 from a friend when I moved to Texas last Summer.  The truck is in good condition and has about 94,000 miles on it.  I haven't had trouble with it at all since I got it.  It is the last &quot;Mazda&quot; model year, before Ford basically changed the truck into the Ford Ranger.

Ok, so it isn't really a truck, more like a step up from an El Camino, but it's wheels, and its dependable.  The bed is also six feet long, making it easy to carry anything.  I have moved furniture with it, and also use it to take my bike to the park every day.  Try doing that with one of those 4 ft bed 4 door Nissans! I get about 22 miles per gallon with the truck, and have had no problems with it, as long as I perform preventive maintenance.

The truck is very no frills.  It has air conditioning, but that's about it, which is ok.  I would recommend this truck type to someone who needs inexpensive wheels, and may need to transport large objects.<br><br>
