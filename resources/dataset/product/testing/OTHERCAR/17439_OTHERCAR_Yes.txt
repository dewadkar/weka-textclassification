            Although this is basically the Isuzu Rodeo with a premium of a few thousand dollars, I feel it is well worth it, knowing you get the Honda service. 

I've had this car for over 6 months with no problems whatsoever. It is a pleasure to drive both in the city and out. Buying a SUV the feeling of safety is quite impressive and it makes you feel a lot safer, knowing that if anyone were to hit you in a direct collision, the impact would be at your legs. I guess the only negative is that with higher centers of gravity, SUVs' are more likely to tip over, but I'd rather tip over anyday than be in a crushed car. 

Gas mileage is a negative. I get approximately 18-19 mpg, but I guess that's the price you pay for having a SUV. The inside is quite spacious and the controls are very simple, as in most Honda models. 

If you live in a snowy area, 4WD is a must. I don't even have to shovel my driveway, just kick in the 4WD and just drive away. We've had a snow storm up here and had approximately 8-9 inches. No problem! Just drove right by all those snowed in front/rear wheel drivers. <br><br>
