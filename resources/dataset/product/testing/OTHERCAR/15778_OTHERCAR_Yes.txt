            I have had my Prius for about two months now and I just love it.  It is so comfortable and smooth to drive.  I love that the video screen has a night dimmer and touch screen buttons.

I really like that the speedometer and other gauges are not right in my face, but rather up higher in the center of the dash.

It does take a little getting used to the fact that the car doesn't accelerate quite like a normal car, but unlike the Honda Hybrid it still can "get up and go" when needed.

My gas mileage has been around 38 - 40 in city and highway. The heater warms quickly and works very well.  I have seen no ill effects to the car with the cold weather.  I thought it might take longer to warm up because of the electric system.

All in all the car drives well, does have excellent gas mileage, has a great sound system, and the price is good.  My Prius was $19,500.
