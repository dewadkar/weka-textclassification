            From what I've said in my pros and cons, you would think I was of two minds about this car, but not at all.  While there are things that I wish lived up to other car manufacturers levels, this car is an excellent buy.

When I took the very car I bought for a test drive, I thought it would have the kind of power that a Focus would have.  I decided to pass an oil truck to get a sense of the response that it had and was blown away.  The Honda Civic was just as peppy for more money and I was amazed at what it could do on the road.  Handling?  Sticky to the pavement, in rain and dry.

This car is fun to drive.  That's right, fun. A good enough reason right there.

The esthetics of the car were a right on hit for me.  I purchased the black model and despite the joys of cleaning a black car, people were amazed at its looks.

The tinny trunk is an issue.  The split seat was nice, but when down, the road noise through the trunk area is nasty.  There's no sound buffering and it's enough that I might make something to dull the sound.

Great hookups for kids seats, no complaints there.  My little guy loves the growly engine, which soothes him to sleep.  If you're looking for a completely quiet car, this isn't for you.  This car sounds a little like a cat when you drive...

A couple of things to watch for.  The way the wipers work, they have a tendency to get iced up in the winter a lot, because they sit below the level of the window, so no window heat to thaw them out.  I had to strip the ice off of them all winter.  Secondly, the transmission is not the strongest.  While attempting to extricate myself from a snowbank, I was trying to rock the car forward and back.  I'm no slouch at this, but the car would stall if I used too little gas, and this is kind of the point when you don't want the wheels to spin, isn't it?  Also, backing up requires a heavy gas to overcome a serious shudder.

Overall, after going from dealer to dealer, this car satisfied me, and continues to, we've had it for months now, and love it. A great buy from Hyundai.  I hope they accept this as a trade in later for one of the SUV's.
