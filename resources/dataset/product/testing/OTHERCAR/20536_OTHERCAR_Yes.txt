            The 2000 Cadillac Eldorado is one of the finer vehicles I have owned. It has all the sportiness, handling ability and luxury one could ever ask. I have owned this for five weeks and have yet to find any disappointments. 

I chose the popular color of moonstone with a moonroof. The leather/memory seating is perfect for me and my wife. The trunk space is more than adequate. I have driven this car to Las Vegas and it loves the open road! In town it has superb passing ability and parking it is a cinch. 

The extras I ordered were the gold/chrome wheels, carriage top and multi-disc CD player. Everything else I could want is already standard equipment. I would that the Northstar low maintenance engine is a relief and needless to say, reliable. All in all I would highly recommend the Cadillac Eldorado with it's front wheel drive and other mechanical appointments exclusive only to Eldorado.<br><br>
