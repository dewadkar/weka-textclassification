            Bought an LXi with lots of options and its great.  Ride is very nice and with the optional 3.8L engine, acceleration is super.  Interior is roomy with versatile seating arrangements.  Despite the lack of a folding 3rd seat, you have lots of options for seating arrangements.  Lots of power outlets in convenient places.  Comfortable seating with lots of room for adults in the third seat.

Entertainment system is nice with good picture on LCD.  Only concern is that VCR is wired into center console and power is live so if you forget to turn of VCR, could drain your battery.

Test drove the Odyssey and the T&C wins hands down.  Ride is much better and interior is so much nicer.  Definitely upscale.  Room to move on price so don't discount vs. others based on MSRP.
