            the lincoln navigator is  the best sport utility around.
i purchased this vehicle because i have three kids 9,6,and 2 and needed the space as a caravan but the luxary of a car with out feeling i was driving a bus like all the vans out there .. i am able to seperate my kids so there is no fighting..they have there own climate control.
 and for long trips they are able to play nintendo 64 and watch video tapes with the t.v and vcr we had installed.
 the options on this truck that i really like is the adjustable foot pedal so shorter people do not have to sit so close to the steering wheel.
 the next is having the radio controls on the steering wheel. the only thing i do not like is that it is a gas guzzler.
 but i knew that before i bought it because i went from the expedition to the navigator. i feel very safe when driving this vehicle because i am up high and it is big. and i know that my children are safe. people that should buy this vehicles are parents that do a lot of car pooling.
 i can fit 9 in my car.<br><br>
