            I recently purchased the Nubira Wagon and I do like the car very much.  Except for a few minor problems that you might find in most new cars, it is very satisfactory.  The problem I am having is that I received a letter from Daewoo stating they are cutting down on most of the authorized service centers and now I will have to make an 80-mile round trip to take advantage of their special service contract.  This was a major selling feature and I even extended it to 72,000 miles.  Making the 80-mile trip will quickly use up my warranty mileage not to mention cost me a lot of time.  I will be stuck there for hours for even a minor repair (no way to get home). I feel this is really a shame, it's a great car, very good price for the product, but the lack of service centers makes it less attractive.  What is the use of getting a lot of free maintenance if you have to use time and warranty miles up getting it.
Not very cost saving.<br><br>
