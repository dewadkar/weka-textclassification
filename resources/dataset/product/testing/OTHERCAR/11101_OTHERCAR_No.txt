            I purchased a Ricoh RDC-2 about two years ago - It stopped working less than a year after I bought it. The camera was fine, picture quality good and easy to use. It used batteries like crazy. I sent in for repair last September, received a notice it would cost $100+ to repair, then in November I was notified it needed additional repairs, cost now over $300. It is now January and I still don't have my camera that's almost 5 months!! Thumbs up on picture quality and ease of operation, but service is terrible. I've emailed Ricoh three times without a response, very poor customer relations.<br><br>
