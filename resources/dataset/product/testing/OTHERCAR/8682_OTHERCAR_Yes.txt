            This afternoon after work, I saw my neighbor's brand new 2000 Honda Accord.  I did not test drive it yet although he brought me for a ride in it.  I think it is the LX version with the 6 cylinder engine.
He had a black on tan leather color scheme.  Hondas have proven themselves to be reliable over the past years.  The engine will probably be good for 300,000 miles if he properly maintains it.

<b>Inside the car</b>
This car was nicely laid out with large to see gauges and easy to control buttons.  Seemed like everything is placed in driver friendly locations.  He has the leather seats which are very comfortable and supportive.  I would suggest the &quot;heater&quot; option if available.  I was freezing my butt off here for a while (I am in MASS and it is in the 20's for temperature)
The driver's seat had an 8 way power adjustment system.  It had power door locks, windows, moonroof, foglights, a/c, abs, and a very nice sounding 6 disc in the dash cd stereo system.  As far as room, there is definitely room for 5 adults in comfort.  I did not sit in the rear but it did not give the appearance that an average sized person would be crushed!  I had more than enough head, hip, and leg room in the front.  I am thin and 5'10&quot; to help give you an idea of my size.

<b>Engine</b>
I only researched the specs on the engine on this car.  He has the optional 200 HP 6 cylinder that kicks out 195 lbs of torque.  The torque is the muscle power you feel when you step on it.  I felt the car move.  The engine is vibration free and practically silent.  You can hardly feel the transmission shift gears.  He had it up to 110 on the highway and I could not believe it how quiet and smooth it rode.  The gas mileage is estimated at 20 city and 28 hwy which is not bad on average.

<b>Overall</b>
I loved the ride in the car.  This car is built in the USA, Ohio to be exact. That is acceptable to me.  I usually try to buy American when possible.  I am a diehard GM fan myself.  To continue on about this nice car though, it rode very smoothly and I did not feel any heavy lean when my neighbor turned the corners  (sometimes too fast to my likings).
I really like this car now.  It is definitely sharp and stylish.  It is worth checking out if you are in the market.  I think they start in the 17k range and end up around 25k decked out. <br><br>
