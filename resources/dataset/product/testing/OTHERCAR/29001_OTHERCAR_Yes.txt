            My 10-year-old Nissan Sentra was really falling apart <i>(I thought the engine would fall out while I was driving)</i> and I needed a new car.  I never liked my Nissan so it was important that I get a car I would enjoy driving.  I researched cars for a solid six months before deciding on the CRV.

<b>The long road to the Honda CRV:</b>
I began with convertibles as I wanted something really fun to enjoy the beautiful Los Angeles weather.  I got to thinking that, since we are starting to plan for a family, a convertible was a bad idea.  Most convertibles have small back seats, little storage space and do not have roll bars.  Bad idea while carting around children.
I moved onto the stylish Passat Wagon which is a beautiful car that would easily accommodate a family but too expensive for my budget!  Other wagons didn�t really excite me.

I then resigned myself to a sedan which was not fun but practical and inexpensive.  I gravitated to Hondas because generally they are good, solid cars and I�d had an Accord once and loved it.  Besides, Honda was having a great deal on interest rates for the Accord and Civic.  I hesitated on the purchase because I was not excited about the car.  A sedan met my practical needs, but it did not meet my desire to have fun.

While at the dealership, I spotted the CRV and really liked the way it looked, drove and the fun features <i>(picnic table, ice chest, compartments, etc)</i>.  So, on a whim, I checked with my insurance company <i>(because my budget is tight)</i> to see how much more my insurance would be if I purchased a small SUV.  It would only go up $70 more per year and that was not even because of the SUV!  I�d changed jobs and the commute was greater so the insurance premium went up!  Well, $70 was very doable for me.  Now the real research began!

I looked at several SUVs in the same class <i>(i.e. RAV4, Vitara which I always want to call Viagra)</i> but always came back to the CRV.  It looks great, is really roomy inside <i>(my husband is tall and has no problem with the head room or the back seat leg room)</i>, it drives like a sedan, and it has all the fun features I mentioned earlier.  I had to have it!

I won�t bore you with the details of the negotiation dance with several dealers.  The only advice I give is that you know exactly what you want, know what it is worth, what you are willing to pay and stick to it, and contact several dealerships.  I contacted 12 different ones�6 called me back.  Choose your dealership as wisely as you choose your car!  The Internet Sales guys at Valencia Honda made the purchasing experience really painless and, to be honest, pleasurable!

On July 15, 2000 I purchased a white 2wd, 2000 LX with a roof rack, tinted windows, a cargo cover, and a Lojack Recovery System for $18,000.

<b>What I like about the CRV:</b>
OK.  My daily commute is 16 miles each way traveling on Sunset Boulevard.  It�s stop and go traffic through Hollywood and really curvy stop and go traffic through Bel Air and UCLA.  It takes me one hour each way and it�s a BIG DRAG.  I have to be able to accelerate quickly to get out of the way of a crazy person or an accident.  What I like about the CRV is:

1.   After being low to the ground in the Sentra it�s nice to be able to see over most cars.  I can see and anticipate traffic jams and get out of the way because I�m higher up.

2.   The CRV is really fun to drive.  It handles much like a sedan, but makes me feel safe.  Since I am so much farther off the ground cornering is a little different than a sedan , but it really has not been a noticeable concern. Also, it has cool features like the picnic table, tons of little storage cubbies, a folding center console table, and a nice stereo.

3.   It came standard with power locks and power windows.  After having to remind everyone riding in my Sentra to lock the door and �hold the handle up� or having to lean over the seats to roll up a window, this feature is a real treat!

4.   It looks great.  The tinted windows and the roof rack really make the car look a bit more rugged.  I still smile when I walk toward my car to get into it!

<b>What I don�t like about the CRV:</b>
I love my car so much, I hate to tell you what I don�t like.  They are minor but bothersome nonetheless:

1.   With all the cubbyholes for storage it really does not have a good place to hold my cellular phone while it is plugged into the power jack.  I lay it on the floor between the driver and passenger seats.

2.   I find the cup holders in the front seat unreliable.  My bottled water kept falling out <i>(thankfully it was capped)</i> so, to date, I haven�t tried it with a soda!

3.   The drivers-side window controls are on the dash rather than the door so I keep locking the door when I want to open the window.  It has taken some getting used to.

4.   My car did not come with standard floor mats.  The dealer wanted to charge me $150 for the CRV mats which I could not justify.  I�m now on a mission to find ones that are less expensive.

5.   The car comes standard with an arm rest on the drivers-side but the passenger-side arm rest is an option.  Since I am not a passenger in my car it has not been an issue for me.  None of my passengers have complained either.

The only other thing to keep in mind is that the 2wd LX is an economy car not a luxury car.  I was not looking for a luxury car.  I was looking for something practical and fun that fit my price range.  Don�t get me wrong, it�s beautiful and VERY comfortable.  If you are in the market for a luxury car, Honda does have higher-end CRVs that have luxury features such as v6 engine, 4wd, leather interior, etc.

In closing, <b>I LOVE THIS CAR</b>.  I have already recommended it to several friends and will continue to do so!<br><br>
