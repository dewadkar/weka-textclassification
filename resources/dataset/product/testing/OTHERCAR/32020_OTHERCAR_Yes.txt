            Revised:
I just had the luxury of test-driving the most comfortable car I have ever driven, the 2001 Buick Regal LS.  This car is absolutely the perfect family car.

The Regal LS comes standard with 4 wheel ABS and traction control, keyless entry and drivers side power seat.   The model I drove had a sticker price of $24999.00.  The engine was the 3.8 liter 200 HP V-6.  The engine was very impressive and was rated at 20mpg in the city.  Acceleration from a dead stop set you back in the seat.  Passing at 40-60mph really woke you up also.  I don't know why anyone would want the supercharger.  Well yes I do.

The interior had plenty of room for 2 adults and three children in the backseat.  The backseat had a split fold down seat to access the trunk. There was also a fold down armrest.  The LS offered the Onstar system but the model I drove did not have it.  I do not know how much the option was. This option is standard on the GS.

The ride of the car was great.  It handled well and was very quiet inside. At 50+ mph it was quiet inside, no road noise.  This is to be expected of a Buick. 
I owned a 1988 regal and this is not at all the same vehicle.  Although that car had over 300,000 miles on it when I traded it in.  I think you can expect the same quality from the 2001 vehicles, as Buick has always been a very dependable vehicle.  

This is a very good car for any family.  You get lots of room and safety features without spending over $30,000.  The gas mileage is also very nice.  You won't go wrong with this vehicle.
