            I think that this is the best car I have ever owned. It is durable and you put whatever opinions on it that you want like a CD-player, spoiler and a sunroof and whatever other opinion that are offered where ever purchased your car I would highly recommend this car to any of my friends If they ever were to ask me my opinion on what I think is a good car to own and this the first car I would highly recommend because when I bought my Honda Accord Lx I got good service at the dealer ship. I think that the best time to buy a new car is on New Year's Eve it is a good way to ring in the New Year. I also think that this is the only kind of car I will ever own as long as I own a car. This is the best car I have ever owned and I would not change cars for any thing this also makes a good family car. It also has a lot of trunk space  and alot of room in the back seats. <br><br>
