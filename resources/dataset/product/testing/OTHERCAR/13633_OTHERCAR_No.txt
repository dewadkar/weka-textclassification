            My experience with the Kia Sportage was a love/hate relationship.  I traded my Chevy Conversion Van in April 1998, for a 1998 Kia Sportage 4X4.   I first read about the Kia Sportage in Car and Driver Magazine in 1995.  During 1995, I had purchased a Hyundai Accent as a commuter car, and ended up being surprised at how much I like it.  My Hyundai Accent gave me faith in Korean auto makers, which I erroneously transcribed to the Kia Corporation.

In April, 1998, I decided to check out Thomas Kia in Highland, Indiana.  After taking the Kia Sportage for a test drive, I decided that I like the way it handled, and felt that it performed to my expectations.  The model had an attractive design, and seemed to be easy to get into and out of.  After haggling over the trade, I managed to get what I felt was a good deal, and traded my Conversion Van for the Kia Sportage 4X4.

I owned the Kia Sportage from April 1998 until March 2000, when I traded it for a Ford Expedition.  I traded the Kia Sportage for several reasons, but the primary reason centered around the lack of confidence that I developed concerning this vehicle.  There were several problems that I encountered during my two years of ownership, that probably could have resulted in successful litigation if I were a lawsuit-orientated person.

My initial complaints about this automobile were trivial.  There is a center console located between the front seats, which contains a storage area.  This console was designed primarily from plastic components, which broke easily.  When I brought this to the company's attention, they repaired the console with metal parts.  The problem appeared to be widespread, which seems apparent from the change in material used on the repair.  I also had minor problems with the rear windshield wiper fluid, which they claimed couldn't be corrected.  The weak stream of water dispensed fails to adequately clean the windshield.

During the Summer of 1998, I took my family to Disney World in Orlando, Florida.  During the trip, we experienced temperatures in the upper 90's.  The air conditioning unit on the Kia Sportage failed to keep up with the weather, and did not even produce a moderately cool stream of air.  This lack of adequate air conditioning made the trip extremely uncomfortable, and prompted me to take the vehicle in for examination.  After attempting to duplicate the problem, the service department claimed that they did not find anything wrong.  I subsequently experienced the same problem on multiple occasions, and brought the vehicle in for repairs several times, without success.  During one repair, they claimed that the fluid drain in the right front of the car was clogged, and that was the cause of our problem.  Although this repair prevented water from accumulating on the passenger side of the car (which was a one-time only problem), it still did not address the problem of inadequate air conditioning.

These minor problems still did not calculate to the level of a lawsuit.  However, while waiting in the drive-thru at out bank, my (then) pregnant wife started rolling forward towards a major road.  Luckily, she had the presence of mind to apply the emergency brake, stopping her forward motion.  When I contacted the Kia Dealership, they seemed to be very unconcerned about my wife's health, and even appeared to be reluctant to send a tow truck to bring the Sportage into their shop.  After examining the vehicle, it was determined that the brake line was routed over the steering knuckle, which caused the knuckle to rub against the hose whenever the Kia was steered right or left.  This continual rubbing resulted in a hole, which allowed the brake fluid to run out of the line.  Therefore, my wife was left with no brake fluid, which could have been fatal if it occurred while she was on the open road.  Kia ended up conducting a nationwide recall for this problem nearly ONE YEAR following this incident.  Apparently they didn't determine it was fatal enough to address immediately following OUR experience.  I guess I should have sued them, just to do a favor to my fellow driver!  However, at the time, I did not realize that it was a problem with every Kia Sportage.

This incident shook my confidence in Kia.  After the recall notices went out nationwide, I realized that they waited a full year before they addressed the problem to other consumers.  This made me angry and concerned.  What if there were other problems that they were holding back on...

After spending a few weeks checking out a variety of vehicles, I decided to trade my Kia Sportage for a Ford Expedition.  The Expedition was roomier, had a much stronger engine, provided adequate cooling, and handled well.  Also, it seemed to be very easy to get a car seat in and out of.

My overall experience with Kia Sportage is a mixed bag.  I liked the way it handled, the acceleration was not tops, but it was adequate for an SUV.  The few times that I took it off road, it handled well.  The frame seemed sturdy, and handled bumps well.  However, this vehicle did have a lot of highway noise, and the paint on the trim work was extremely susceptible to the elements, as well as highway debris.  Small tick marks were visible throughout the trim work by the time I traded my Kia Sportage, after owning it for less than two years.  Although I loved the comfort that I felt driving the Kia Sportage, I hated the discomfort I felt at knowing Kia made an inferior product, and failed to alert consumers IMMEDIATELY to potentially fatal design problems.  Overall, I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.<br><br>
