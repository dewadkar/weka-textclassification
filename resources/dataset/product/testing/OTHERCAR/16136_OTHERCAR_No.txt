            I purchased the Jeep Cherokee, because it is in the top of it's line for SUV safety.  
I loved to drive this car.  I sat up very height off the top of the road, and could see better.  The handling was ok, except to make sharp turns.  My old toyota could turn on a dime, the jeep could not.
I loved having all the room, and that the back seat could lay down.  I bought a table a bench and a coffee table from Pier One and they all fit inside.
I hated that the stereo that came in mine (tape deck) really sucked.  The sound system just wasn't good at all.  Next I didn't like the fact that two months after I had it, it rolled three times on me.  I was on dry road and rolled into a local convenience store parking lot.  Even the cop was not sure how it happened.  The vehicle was totaled, I was ok (I luckily had my seat belt on).  
Really Adventurous people should buy this vehicle, however, those who are use to tiny mid-sized to compact cars should not.  The handling on turns is just to different.  <br><br>
