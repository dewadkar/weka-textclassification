            Introduced for the 1991 model year, Mitsubishi entered the sports car market with the 3000GT.  Base and SL models for the 1994 model year were both powered by normally-aspirated V6 engines, while the top-of-the-line VR-4 added twin turbochargers, all-wheel drive, and other features.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: When the 3000GT was introduced in 1991, it came with pop-up headlights.  This year, those headlights were replaced with with 4 fixed headlamps.  Overall styling is fine, but cannot compare to direct competitors such as the Toyota Supra and Nissan 300ZX.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: For this model year, the 3000GT became available with dual front airbags.  Front-seat space is tight for taller people, but are comfortable enough for long trips.  The front seats are very supportive laterally, in case you like to take your corners fast.  The rear seats, however, are extremely tight on space.  It is best left as storage space.  Speaking of storage space, the 3000GT can hold up to 11.1 cubic feet of cargo space.  At 49 inches tall, I tend to have a hard time getting in and out of the car, being that I'm rather tall.

Once in, the cabin is very sporty yet luxurious too.  The gauges are clear, and the controls are easy to understand.  Unfortunately, I feel that the LCD display for the automatic climate control washes out too easily in sunlight.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The base and SL models are powered by a 3.0-liter DOHC V6 engine that produces 222 horsepower and 205 lb./ft. of torque.  Although it does not have quite the forceful feel of the VR-4, there is more than enough power all throughout the rev range to be satisfied.  Fuel economy and insurance premiums are also improved with this model.  When the VR-4 model was first introduced, it put out 300 horsepower, but for 1994, that number was increased to 320 by way of extra boost pressure.  Torque also went up from 307 lb./ft. to 315.  A 5-speed manual transmission is standard on both the base and SL.  Optional for both is an electronically-controlled 4-speed automatic.  For 1994, the VR-4 gets a standard 6-speed manual instead of a 5, but no automatic is available.

<b>HANDLING</b>: The front-drive 3000GTs (base and SL) are excellent handlers.  Despite the fact that it weighs 3,803 pounds, the VR-4 actually handles BETTER than the lesser front-drive models.  I enjoy every moment behind the wheel in this model.  The VR-4 is so stable at high velocities, speed can be deceptive unless you are in traffic.  With all-wheel drive and four-wheel steering easily weighs about 600 pounds more than a base model.  Again, 3,800 pounds may sound heavy, but all 3000GTs have powerful anti-lock 4-wheel disc brakes that bring even the hefty VR-4 to stop quickly.

<b>RIDE</b>: With the standard 225/55VR-16 tires (on the base and SL), the ride is firm, but NEVER uncomfortable.  Even large bumps are absorbed better than the likes of a Toyota Supra, or Mazda RX-7.  The VR-4 and its stiff low-profile 245/45ZR-17 tires are much more uncomfortable, and has the tendency to bang over large bumps, as expected with most sports cars.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: The only noticeable problem I noticed while driving was a horn button that popped out of the steering wheel.  There are 2 recalls issued so far since the introduction of the 1994 3000GT.  For more information, go to:

<b>VALUE</b>: The 3000GT is an awesome Japanese GT sports coupe.  Sadly, very few people were interested enough which led to its demise in 2000.  Best suited as a "personal" daily driver, the 3000GT is an fairly good buy if you are interested in purchasing a stylish, all-weather sports car.  Base and SL models have lower insurance premiums and better gas mileage.  The VR-4 is very fast, but best left as a weekend racer.
