            Well it has been about 6 years since I bought anything other than a minivan or sport utility vehicle.So when choosing another vehicle I examined cost , power interior room and traction control for front wheel drive .I found all in the new Monte Carlo SS .The price was awesome large discounts of close to $4500 are out there.Found all the options I was looking for as well as a car with beautiful lines , not your cookie cutter cars out there today. Long and flowing beautiful curves a real head turner.
    This is some car real quick extremely luxurious beautiful and takes corners like my old 1986 vette.Power is good and the tranny shifts real quick ,Although I wish they offered a autostick for spirited driving like chrysler or tiptronic like porsche. Radio is awesome  heated seats are a joy when it is cold and leather is the seat material.Trunk is so big it reminds me of dads old Impala .I have driven car only 1000 miles so far but I am happy with value , power, handling and workmanship.
