LOOKS/COMFORT
    I've had my 1999 2 door LS Z71 tahoe for about a year now and I am loving it.  I prefer the 2 door model to the 4 door because it's not as large and in my opinion, the 4 door model is just like the Suburban.  For those of you who don't know, there are several different models: the LS, LT, and Sport.  Any of these can have the 4WD, off road capabilities that is known as the "Z71" package.  I have the LS model which is more luxorious than the other three choices because it is availiable with leather interior and has chrome bumpers and grille.  The Sport package is a cheaper model and it has a rubbery look to the bumper and grille and cloth interior.  I love my gray leather bucket seats and front console and there are over 7 drink compartments throughout the entire car including 3 in the backseat.  The rear seats can also fold down so you have more luggage space.  The car is great looking on the outside and extremely comfortable on the inside.  The AC works great while the heat takes a little while to warm up but that's not too bad because I live in a warm climate.  I have also added a front brush guard, rear light guards, nerf bar, and fog lights to spice up the look.  But even without adding anything, Tahoes make teens and all car fans alike whip their heads around to check it out.


EASY TO DRIVE
Despite the bulky look, this car has a great turning radius and it's not too hard to manuever in traffic or parking lots once you get used to it.  It has good pick up and can go up to 100 mph.  Because I have 4wd capabilities I have options on the dash of the car so that I can change it to Auto 4WD, 2 HI, 2 LO, etc. and I have gone mudding in my Tahoe several times.  It has never gotten stuck and has cushiony suspension so I don't feel potholes or small ditches too much.  I had only driven small cars before I got this one and I like having a higher view so much better and I find it a lot easier to drive.  It has a towing package on it and can tow up to 5,000 lbs although I have not tried out this feature yet.  

There are really no faults that I can find in my beloved car, only the gas mileage but it is better than most SUV's.  I find it gets about 16 mpg city and 19 mpg highway and because I drive a lot I generally have to tank up every 10 days.  I bought it used last year with 29,000 miles on it which is rare because I see a lot of 99's with atleast 45,000 miles or more on them.  I have had no repairs done to it and it runs like a dream.  I guess the factory radio and speakers aren't too great, so I installed a better sound system.  Overall though, I would definitely buy this car, the 2 door model seems to be the dream of any teenager but I'm sure adults will appreciate it as well.

Here's a list of features that I especially like...
Automatic transmission 
Vortec 8 cylinder 5.7 liter engine (tune-ups at 100,000 miles) 
Autotrac 4x4 transfer case (pushbuttons on the dashboard) 
Air conditioning and heat
Driver and passenger air bag 
AM/FM stereo with CD player, cassette player and 4 speakers 
30-gallon fuel tank 
Four wheel anti-lock brakes 
tilt steering wheel, cruise control, power windows and door locks 
Driver's seat 6-way power adjuster 
Rear defroster and wiper 
tinted back windows
Luggage carrier 
Remote keyless entry with alarm 
Overhead console consisting of LED outside temperature display and directional heading 
Towing package
