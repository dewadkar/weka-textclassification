            My wife and I made our first major purchase together this past August, and we've been nothing but happy with our new 1999 Honda Civic LX Sedan.  Its performance has been great.  It's a smooth ride, and the interior makes long trips seem much too short.  The 4-cylinder has plenty of pickup- which is useful when you're navigating the busier streets in any town.  If you're looking to make an investment on a &quot;legacy&quot; car (one that can be handed down), this is a good bet.  I don't know why anyone wouldn't want a car like this.<br><br>
