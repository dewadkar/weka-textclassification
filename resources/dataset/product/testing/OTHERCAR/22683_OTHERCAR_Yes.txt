            Ten years ago I was looking for a vehicle for my college bound kids to drive. I needed something that was easy to maintain and easy on the pocket book. We're on the third Grand Am - last kid's in college now. They have been everything I'd hoped for. Maintenance has been practically nil. Mileage across the board has been mid to upper 30's on the highway. I've owned automatics and 5 speed models, the &quot;iron duke&quot; and quad-4 engines. They've performed flawlessly. Normal, scheduled maintenance has kept these cars on the road better than 99% of the time. The Grand Am is a comfortable car to drive and ride in for those of us that are over 6 foot. However, the pedals are a tad harder to reach for those who are closer to 5 foot.

The Grand Am's have great visibility. The interior appointments are typical GM, but they do wear like iron. They're sporty looking cars. The car has the look and feel of more expensive cars. The ones I've owned have been solidly built. They're large enough to provide safety and comfort without causing a real drain on the pocketbook.

I'd consider another one and so would my kids, even if I didn't buy it for them. <br><br>
