            I have had my Honda accord coupe for 6 months.  I had owned a honda accord sedan, but I gave it to my mom, because her car conked out.  I had no problems when I owned my sedan.  When I got into a major accident with it.  It was fixable,and it drove like new, when I got it fixed.  So I wanted to stick with Honda, when I was looking to purchase a new car. My husband didn't want me to get the sedan, because since we do not have kids, what was the point of getting a 4 door.  So I went with the coupe. The thing that intrigued me, was the difference in the sleekness of the body compared to the older models.  It seemed to be small from the outside, but when you step inside, there is alot of room.  I do a lot of long distance driving, and I never got uncomfortable, or had to do alot of shifting to adjust myself.  The controls on the panels were all within arms reach.  Never had to stretch for the radio.  The ride is very smooth.  The dash is so modern.  At night with the lights, it's like a nightclub, everything illuminates.  Mind you, you can adjust the lights.  I like it bright! The trunk space is great.  The same as the sedan.  And you can push the back seats for more cargo.  I hear that the backseats are comfortable.  I have never been back there.  Alot of storage space for your sunglasses/CD's etc.  The glove compartment is huge.  I can't tell you the technical stuff.  I own a V6, so it's not to great with gas.  I usually have to fill up at least once a week, compared to the sedan which gas would last me 2 weeks.  THe only issue I have, is since there are no side bumpers, I have tons of dings, and scratches on the doors.  I try to park away from people, but things happen.  I hope Honda does something about that in the future.  The security system is great, someone tried to break into my car, and I could hear my car go off, from inside my work (office building).  There is no way someone can break in.  It's a very sexy, sleek car, and I love it.
