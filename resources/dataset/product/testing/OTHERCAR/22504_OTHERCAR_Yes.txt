            Hi There,
     It was 1994 when I bought my brand new Prelude, Since I was the previous owner of a few preludes it seemed the only right thing to do is stick with what works.  Well not only did this car work but this car had it all, power everything except autopilot, the power was unmatched by Mustangs of the same year event the older 5.0's and I even gave a Lam. Diablo a run for it's money.  Yes I did upgrades to it, and it is an easy model to upgrade for performance.  The price on Preludes is kind of high but if you want a cheap car then buy a Chevette, the Honda is power packed and ready for an easy coasting drive down a riverside road or a roaring race down an open stretch, the car is comfortable, has a decent amount of room and trunk space, dosen't have a tendency to leave you stranded, and always looks sharp.  I have looked into many models of Preludes and if you were going to buy one but weren't quite rich enough to afford the newest model, I would say get this model, the 94 has the vtec engine not to mention a nice body form, the body kits for this model aren't too badly priced, the performance is INCREDIBLE, the handling is just amazing and the parts are midrange in price.  I guarantee that if you take good care of this car it will last you a lifetime, and that isn't just a line from a promotional magazine, I have owned many preludes and not one of them has quit or died on me yet, in-fact I still have 2 1986 si preludes and the 84 I had I sold to a friend and it lasted even after the radiator was bust and completely removed, he in turn sold it to salvage for 300$, try to get salvage to pay you anything over 10$ on an 84 anything and I will be impressed.
