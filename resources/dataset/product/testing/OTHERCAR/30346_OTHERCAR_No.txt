                 I was given this camera about 4 weeks ago when my father bought himself a much better digital camera.  Being that the only digital camera I have is built into my camcorder I figured that this would be more convenient to carry around than carrying the camcorder ever occasion I went to. Before taking it I found that he only spent $17 on it so I now didn&#146t expect much form it.  The camera is pretty easy to use.  It has two buttons and takes 3 &#147AAA&#148 batteries.  It, however, has no flash so you will need adequate lighting when taking pictures.  

What the camera comes with:
�	1 USB cable.
�	Instruction guide
�	1 cd-rom with four programs
�	My DSC to either download pictures or run the video mode of the camera
�	Photo Fantasy which allows you to put the faces of the subjects you have taken and place them in zany, pre-made photos
�	Photo Studio 7.05, which is a very bad copy of Adobe&#146s Photoshop.
�	Photo Printer allows you to portraits form 8 x 10 to wallet size (just like the                               
      Photos from grade school)


     The camera is pretty basic and easy to use.  The menu has 7 features to choose from. They are pretty easy to get to; just simply hit the menu button till you get to the desired feature. When you get to the feature his the shutter button to make the function work 

Camera Features:
�	HR for high resolution pictures (20 pictures total)
�	Of to turn the camera off
�	St for setting the 10 second timer
�	CT for continuous shots
�	Cl to clear out all the pictures in the camera
�	C1 to remove the last picture taken	
�	Lr for low resolution pictures (50 pictures total)


     After learning the camera and how it works it was now time to use it.  I took it out on father&#146s day and used it at the restaurant I took three pictures and the next day I hooked it up to the computer to see my photos (there is no view screen so this is the only way to see the pictures).  I was not at all surprised to see a very poor quality photo. I then took it to a science museum the following week and the pictures I got form there were much better due to better lighting.  The only problem after seeing these photos was that the largest size I could look at, without problems, was a frame of about 320 x 180.  Anything larger was pixilated. I downloaded the photos and then sent them out in emails. Everyone who got them was upset due to the small size of the pictures.  

     Besides the pixel problems I ran into two other problems.  The day I was given the camera there had 6 shots taken.  The indicator showed 14 shots left.  I did nothing to the camera but the next day they were all gone.  This was not the last time this would happen.  It happened several more times since I had it.  Fortunately I didn&#146t have any pictures I really cared about keeping. The second problem is simple. Don't move the camera around or let you subject move or the show will be blurry.

     The final thing that this camera can do is film video. Just hook up the USB cable, Start the My DSC program for video, and let it run.  The motion is very choppy but it records without any problems.  You can even add sound tracks to what you are filming.

Over all this camera is a toy.  If you are looking for something to play around with before investing in a good Digital Camera this is fine.  If you are a serious picture taker then just pass on this camera.
