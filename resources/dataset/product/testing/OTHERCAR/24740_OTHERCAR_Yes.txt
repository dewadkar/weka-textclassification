            I have this digital camera for over 2 years and yes, it still amazes me every time I use it. I even won an award for a picture taken of a sunset. It's battery is amazing and the lens... well, it's a Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar lens... what can I say? It's just amazing. And it has a 6x zoom which is enough for my fishing trips.

The Memory Stick media it uses to store all your pictures is fantastic, but it has some disadvantage: You <b>must</b> buy an extra one to be really happy. It comes with an 8MB Memory Stick which is not enough for a day outdoors. It can fit you well if you only take small pictures (640 x 480) or if you are at your son's party in the back yard, where you can step into the house and download the pictures every few minutes to your computer.

I bought a 128MB Memory Stick which is enough for a day full of full size/quality pictures (2048 x 1536) as it can store around 70 of these ones. I'm also happy to own an HP laptop which I carry along into long trips, so I download the pictures using the USB interface (which is pretty fast) at the end of the day.

I am a big man, and because of that, my hands are also pretty big, but when I use the menu navigator (which is like a compass), I feel very good... I've never pressed what I didn't intend.

About the case of this camera well, it's also perfect. Obviously after all this time and more than 5,000 pictures taken, the buttons are a little washed up, but they are still readable.

It also includes the capability to record videos at 320x240 or 160x112 pixel resolutions. They are very nice and the microphone works very well in short and long distances. What I don't like is that one can only record up to 15 seconds of video in hi-res or up to 1 minute in low-res. The next model (which my brother have), the DSC-S80 let's you record until the Memory Stick is full... Great no?

The flash is very nice and let's you adjust it's firing power to 3 levels... low, normal and high. It also has a feature to eliminate red eyes, but it makes the shutter to take more time to trigger because of the several short flashing lights that fires first.

I remember once to have taken a picture at night (around 0 lux) with the aperture set to wide and it took a perfect green-kind picture without the flash. Had to be very steady but it worked.

<b>Warning</b>
One MUST take off the lens cap BEFORE turning on the camera or switching from "play" to "still" or the lens system can be broken or the hole lens system can hang (like a computer does), and that's if you're lucky.
