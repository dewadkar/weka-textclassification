            Wonderful statement, &quot;best Diesel&quot;. But, it's the truth. No other Diesel engine can run 350.000 kms and more without any problem. I'm from The Netherlands, and a 300Diesel over here means 3.0/6 cylinder. This is
absolutely the most wonderful car to drive in. Just a Diesel without
advanced technology (TDI/CDI/DI etc.), so nothing can go wrong! It is a
beautiful car to look at, the engine is strong, and there are simply no
alternative vehicles which can compete with the 300D. My opinion is, when
you buy a used car, that you have to go for a safe one. With all Japanese
and French junk for almost less than nothing, it is very safe to buy a
second-hand Mercedes 300D. You should buy this vehicle! In the USA you
don't have to watch so carefully as we must do over here in Europe, because the Mercedes is used often as a taxi. My 300D (355.000 km) is still going strong on the same engine as in 1988. I only go to the garage
once a year for fresh oil, and that's it! I drove over 1.000.000 kms in
various types of Mercedes cars, and it is always the same: no huge
expenses up to 400.000 km.
Best types (don't know if all of these types were sold in the USA):
1.300D Turbo 2.300D  3.300E 24V  4.300E  5.260E  6.500E V8  7. 250D Turbo
Good luck with your Mercedes. You won't regret it!!!<br><br>
