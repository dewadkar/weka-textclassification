            In 1998 I was looking for a high-powered luxury coupe with a manual transmission and room in the back for the kids. I looked at the M3, which did not carry the same amenities as the C70 and when loaded out was pricier still, and did not have as much room in back.  
I waited 6 weeks to get my stick shift.
I am going off lease now and I am not selling the car so I have no vested interest. My opinion comes after having driven the car for 34,000 miles over 3 years.
 
Engine and transmission - the straight five base is somewhat weak and the High-pressure turbo is a big one that doesn't spool up until about 2,000 rpm so the lag is quite noticeable. But when it does hit it is quite a kick in the pants and it pulls strongly all the way to 6500 (redline is 7000). Horsepower is 236@ approx. 5100rpm. The important figure is torque, which is 243@2700. The major complaint I have here is torque steer. This much power going through the front wheels is simply less than ideal from a pure handling perspective. But to be honest, this may have been exacerbated by the fact that I swapped out the stock 225-width rubber for 235 width. (But the 235 looks so much better!) Nonetheless my next car will be rear wheel drive. A luxury option of living in the south.

Interior Fit and finish - I ordered all the bells and whistles. The premium leather is BETTER than any I have seen on Lexus, BMW or AUDI. More supple, better grain. The stereo is fantastic no brand name, just "VOLVO". No doubt the best stock system I have heard.  Now we come to my chief complaint about the car. To access the rear seats you pull up on the seat lever, lean the front seat forward and wait... The front seat slides forward using it's electric motor. The system works, but it is slow. If you have people to get into the car in the rain you had better have a big umbrella.  The rear seats are big enough for two adults to sit in for a BRIEF trip, but access is awkward.  You would not want grandparents climbing back there. They mostly qualify as occasional seats. Another problem is the cup holders were virtually an afterthought. The car is very well put together however. After three years, everything still works, as it should.

Exterior - This car is, in my opinion, beautiful. I have the 17" split 5 spoke wheels. The finish does seem to damage somewhat easily. My wife gave the passenger side door a hip check to close the door and the door dented!
The drivers side has two nasty door dings, just the scars of every day life, but enough to make me park at the far end of the lot in the empty area. My 1995 Eagle Talon did not seem to ding this easily.

Reliability - One problem in 34,000 miles. The right turn signal began to flash rapidly when engaged. This was fixed under warranty. No charge. Apparently it was a computer connection. Subsequently there has been a recall about this very problem. All in all the only money I have spent has been for routine maintenance. 

I am going off lease now and moving on to another vehicle. I have a wife and 2 kids and this vehicle does not work for me. I want a very high performance vehicle with rear wheel drive so this vehicle does not work for me.
