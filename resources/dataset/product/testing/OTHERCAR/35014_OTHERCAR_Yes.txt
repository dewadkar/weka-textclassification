                 Don't be surprised if my Audi reaches 300,000 miles by the end of this year. I purchased my 1990 Audi 90 out of necessity I needed an affordable compact daily driver immediately.The Audi impressed me with attractive features such as; four wheel disc ABS, driver's side airbag, leather interior, moonroof, and a sporty yet practical layout. The car was a high mileage car but nevertheless looked much better than other cars some 5 years younger. This Audi has 206,000 miles on it and it runs much better than my 60,000 mile Ford Probe. On the road the car is very responsive with excellent brakes,handling,and climate control. City driving and trips to the supermarket are always a blast.The overall reliability of my Audi 90 has been second to none with only routine scheduled maintenance visits. I've never encountered any major problems. German engineering has delivered another top performer. I have found that the only two minor annoyances are back seat space and an overall stiff ride. But if you're looking for sporty stylish reliability with it's fair share of amenities then experience the Audi 90.If you have a large family and are looking for lots of space then the Audi 90 is not for you.<br><br>
