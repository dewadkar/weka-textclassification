            Some of you may have read my rave review of the 1999 Daewoo Leganza CDX, entitled "Leganza Soul". Well, as stated there, my car was totaled on Jan 27, '01 by a drunk driver. 

However, impressed with both the performance and protection of my '99 Daewoo, I went to the dealership the very day of the accident and purchased a new 2000 Daewoo Leganza CDX. I have been driving it for nearly 4 months now and, as promised, am submitting this review. 

COMPARISON: '99 vs '00
On the exterior, the '99 and the '00 appear identical. As for performance, I have noticed the improvement of several features. In the '99, the heater was less than desirable and the steering wheel didn't completely return to position after making a turn. Both problems are resolved in the 2000 model. Standard features still include: leather package, power doors and windows, easy-to-reach controls, lighted vanity mirrors, front seat lumbar control, dual air bags, front and back storage compartments, 60/40 split rear seats, rear seat arm rest, shoulder harness seat belts throughout, over-sized trunk space, full-size spare, fog lights, and tilt steering wheel.

UPGRADES
Daewoo's $2500 rebate afforded me all of the upgrades I didn't have (but wanted) in the 1999 model, including: keyless entry, alarm system, 4-position power driver's seat, automatic temperature control, cruise control, plush (Daewoo) front & rear floor mats, power sunroof (vent or open) with interior cover, wood-grain trim & door panels, premier sport tires & hubs, plus a screamin' removable trunk-loaded 6-cd changer stereo with equalizer! Wow! 

PRICE, WARRANTY, EXTRAS
My final $14999 price tag includes a 3year\36,000 mile warranty, scheduled maintenance & service at 6 -,12-, and 18 months, regular oil changes, Cross Country roadside assistance , trip planning, key replacement, and travel discounts (car rentals, hotels, dinners, etc). 

SECOND HONEYMOON?
I've been driving my Leganza four months and love it more than the day I bought the first one in December 2000. I often see the Mazda 626 - a comparable automobile - which was the car I originally wanted to buy. A good car too, yet I would have paid a lot more to get the features my Daewoo has. By the way, I still get great gas mileage too!

Last month, my son & I were eating breakfast at a bagel shop, seated at the window where we could see the car parked out front. A couple left the shop and as they passed my Leganza, the man stopped to admire it, the woman quickly joining him. They spent 5 minutes peering through the windows, pointing, 'oohing', and 'aahing'. Finally, as they rounded the back end searching for the make, a look of recognition came over their faces, followed by a smile, much head nodding, and more looks at the interior before moving on to their own vehicle. My point? It's nice owning a car that people admire yet still don't recognize at first glance.
