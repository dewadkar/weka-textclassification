            In May my sis came down to stay with us for a little while. While we were taking her back to my mom's house, our car broke down. We never intended on having to go car looking at that time, but we only had one car. 

So two days later my hubby and his step dad went out looking. They drove many cars and decided on the Hyundai Elantra Wagon. They were suppose to come back and get me so that I could be a part of the decision too, but it didn't work out that way. I didn't like the car at all at first. 
 
Since I don't drive... I never got my license. I can't tell you how it drives. There's one reason that I definitely would of chosen a different car.

First we're a family of five(2 adults and 3 kids) and it's not roomy enough. Not enough leg space or head space. Very compact. After we get our two year old's carseat in there... there's hardly any room for our two older children... they feel cramped and uncomfortable. I would of chosen something like a van to accommodate our whole family.

The really good thing about this car is that it gets great gas mileage... hubby says. Since he's the one that goes back and forth in it to work 5 days a week it's very economical. Also it has very good air conditioning unit and stereo system.

Next time we will definitely get a van... for more room.<br><br>
