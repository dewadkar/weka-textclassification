                 I am proud to let everyone know I am the owner of a 1992 Mitsubishi Diamante. I just purchased this vehicle last week for a sum of $7,450 to be financed over two years. When I first test drove this car I only did it, because my significant other started professing about how good this car is on the road. So I hopped in and took her for a spin. Love at first drive. One of the first thing that shocked me about the car is that everything worked on the car. Every control in the car still performed without any hitches. However, I was still skeptical because the inside was not as clean as I liked it. To make a long story short after a no hassle application, in which I didn't even give my soc. sec. number I was driving off into the sunset. It wasn't until I got the car off the lot that I really began to appreciate it. The ride is so smooth, ac blows cold, and there is plenty of power. For it to be almost 8 years old I have to give this car a two thumbs up. And also the interior was immaculate. Once I got it to the car wash and put a little Armor All on the leather it began to shine like diamonds. BLING BLING.<br><br>
