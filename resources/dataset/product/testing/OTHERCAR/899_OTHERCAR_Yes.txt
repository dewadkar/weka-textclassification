            I've had an LS for about 5 weeks.  I also looked at the Lexus 300 and 400 series, the Jaguar S Type, the Volvo S80 and a Cadillac DeVille.  I chose the LS for a simple reason.  It was a lot more fun to drive than any of the others and cost thousands less.  In fact, it's a joy to drive.  Compared with the Lexus 400, it's about 1/2 the price.   Here in Raleigh about every third car is a Lexus.  I've only seen one other LS since I bought mine.  I like that.  People still look to see what it is.  

I have the 6-cylinder with the 5-speed.  The weight distribution is nearly perfect 51-49.  I thought the handling was better than the V8 automatic version, and I prefer to shift my own, which you can't do with the 8.  Ford put some of their F1 and NASCAR engineering experience to work in figuring out the suspension package for this one and it shows.  In fact, it's the best handling American sedan I have ever driven.  Period.  Competently driven, it's just a tad slower 0-60 than the V8 auto.  

I like the looks, although I think they could lose the chrome around the license plate.  It has none of that spaceship look that many new cars have.  The interior is comfortable, even when I'm in the back seat.  It is a little cramped there, however, for a long, cross-country drive.  But, this isn't a Town Car and I could say the same thing about every one car I looked at except the Cadillac.  For instance, I'm just under 6'-5&quot; and my head hits the headliner on the Lexus, even in the driver's seat. 

Dislikes?  It has plenty of zip for me, but still trails the competition in the HP department.  This is something everyone seems to focus on, but I've noticed that I normally beat 99 cars out of 100 away from the light with my '88 Ford Ranger with 75 HP and 205,000 miles on the odo.  Nonetheless, I predict that the next model year will see some increases here.  With the manual shift you get only one cup holder in the console.  The center armrest is tiny and there really is no glove compartment after they put the CD changer in there.  Finally, the interior appointments are ok, but not quite up to the standard of some of the much higher priced competition.  A few hundred bucks per unit would probably do the trick here if the bean counters would allow it.

I could have gotten all of those things with any of the other cars on the list, but they would have cost $10k to $30k more for my trouble.  How much is a cupholder worth anyway?<br><br>
