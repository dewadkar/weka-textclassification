            Bought a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee in 1994 and recently sold it.
We were attracted to the Jeep because of styling, convenience, and
practicality of an SUV.  For all intents and purposes, it did live
up to these expectations, but all during the time we owned it, we
experienced gradually increasing problems with it.  Thank God for
the extended warranty we purchased.
Only minor problems cropped up during the manufacturer's warranty
period of 3yr/36,000 miles - stereo had to be replaced, windshield
leaked.  At about 60,000 miles, the water pump went out, the radiator
developed a leak, and the front end started shimmying badly (worn
tie-rod ends, worn steering stabilizer).  Most of this was repaired
under the extended warranty.  This car had never been taken off-road,
so I thought the front end problems were unusual, but they were not
covered! Cost me $425.  At 70,000 miles, it developed an oil leak (valve
cover gasket) and the power steering pump went out. These were covered
under ext. warranty.  At 80,000 miles it began an extremely wierd
electrical problem, so we traded it in on a Grand Prix.
Other than those problems this was a very useful, comfortable vehicle.
Gas mileage wasn't great (17 mpg).  Cannot say that I would recommend
one, though.<br><br>
