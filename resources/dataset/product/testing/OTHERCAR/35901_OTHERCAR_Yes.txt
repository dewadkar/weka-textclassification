            The BMW 3 series has been for years the universally accepted benchmark by which other sports sedans are measured. Similarly the BMW M series has always been regarded as the ultimate performance machine.  So what happened when BMW combined the 3 series sedan with the M series?  Exactly what you would expect.

This car rocks.

It gives you the flexibility of a 4 door car (I take clients and bossman to lunch regularly) and even has fold down rear seats for those trips to Home Depot.  However, the car is also equally functional at the autocross or racing across the track.  This is an amazing car.

Key areas of interest are the overall performance (ie. engine), which is very strong.  i've been driving mine over a year and I still giggle sometimes when hitting the throttle hard.  The brakes on this car are remarkable - it stops fast enough to make u vomit.  The steering is very tight and combined with the tight suspension the car never drifts or floats.  Whether you are going 20 or 80, the car remains glued to the road..  How do they do that?

I will say the car is not for everyone.  if you dont need or appreciate the performance characteristics then you may be mildly offend by some of its side effects (such as rough ride and overall agressive nature).  The car does squeak a bit on the interior (again, side effect of sport suspension).  And of course its not the cheapest car on the block to maintain.  Pretty much everything on the car is specific to this car only (brakes, tires, etc,etc) and are thus a bit more expensive to maintain than other cars (I estimate 20% more expensive overall).  However if you take care of the car then its reputed to last longer than most others, due to its rugged and extreme design.  kewl.

Overall I give this car as many stars as can be given.  if you like to drive but need a sedan than look no further.  Rembember to take care of it once you get it because they dont make it anymore so you gotta make this one last... :-)
