            When I found out I was pregnant with twins in the Spring of 1998 I was driving a Honda Civic Coupe, the first thing we thought of is that it is time to get a new car.  We pondered ideas for months, I really wanted a Toyota Camry and my husband wanted me to get a SUV.  One afternoon my husband came home from work with the idea of a minivan, my immediate reaction was no way.  I refused to be a minivan mom, it just made me feel like such a &quot;mom&quot;.  

Well, after a lot of research and discussing it until we were blue in the face, we decided on the Dodge Grand Caravan.  After thinking about it I realized that with 2 carseats, a doublestroller, diaper bag and groceries that we needed it.  I am so happy with our choice.

This is a beautiful car and it is so easy to drive.  The turning radius is awesome and very easy to back up, even for someone like me (at 5 feet 1 inch).  We have a third seat and additional cargo room behind it for the stroller and groceries.  There are doors on each side, so it is simple to get my kids in and out.  

There are a few features that I should have gotten when I leased it.  We do not have rear vents (heat and airconditioning must come through the front) and I would have preferred the Captain seats behind the front seats, instead we have a bench.  

I think most mom's would love this car.  Oh, and an added bonus for the fathers out there, it also fits a standard sized sheetrock.  My husband LOVES this feature.  I am very happy with my vehicle.<br><br>
