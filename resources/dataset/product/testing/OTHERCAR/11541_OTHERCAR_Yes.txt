            I purchased the 2 door, manual 4 wheel drive, 4Liter, Jeep Cherokee. We live on the side of a hill and in the winter time it is very difficult to get out. We normally go through 300 pounds of salt a year on our driveway. With the Jeep I don't have to shovel anymore! I put the Jeep in 4 wheel drive and out I go! While all my neighbor are still shoveling I'm on my way to work. My neighbors saw how easy it was for me to drive in the snow that they bought one.

We owned a Colt Vista, all wheel vehicle but many times it would not make it out of our driveway. The Cherokee holds the road well in the winter where the Colt had a tendency to slip and slide.

The Cherokees' heater heats up very quickly compared to the Colt. I can have heat while I go to work where as with the Colt I was lucky to have some warmth by the time I got to work.

The Cherokees' ride is not as comfortable as the Colts, the suspension let you feel many of the bumps.

Getting into the Cherokee is a little difficult because it sits higher than the Colt and many other conventional automobiles.

The Cherokee is a vehicle most people would enjoy owning. The only people who may have some difficulty with the Cherokee would be older people who may have problems getting into the vehicle.
