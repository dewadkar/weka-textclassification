            I had been looking for a digital camera and saw the Fuji. I bought it and now I love it.. I was so shocked at how easy it was to use. All I have to do is look at the viewer in the back snap the pic and I am ready for a new pic.. Also you can set it to where when you take a pic and you dont like it you can delete it right then.. :) It is so easy to set up. My 5 yr old even takes great pics with it :) So now you know it is easy to use if he can take pics with it :)
 It is also easy to load your pics on your PC. you just have to plug it in and put it on the PC pic and then click on the camera on the screen and your pics load. Then the ones you want to save just click on them and then save them as whatever you want. and they are on the computer then.
 Then you can go back to your camera and delete them so you can take more great pic's. The color and quality are so great :) I am so glad I decided to get this one.. It is durable also I have dropped mine and it is still working great :)<br><br>
