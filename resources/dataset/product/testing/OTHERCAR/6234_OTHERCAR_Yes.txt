            WOW, that is all I have to say about this truck. This truck is UNBELIVEABLE, it has every good feature a car needs, it has great drive, look, gas milage, stero, comfort,4X4 drive, and price. I just love this thing, i have driven 9,000 miles in mine with no problems! They are really the ideal truck. And Nissan is an extrdinary company. I would highly reccomend this Truck for it's drive, price, look, sapce(Cargo and Passanger) gas milage, and reliability. For an optimum experience buy this truck in Yellow! that will really catch peoples eyes. I have a Yellow and get all the chicks wnating a ride, and even get a WINK every once in a while at a red light.
