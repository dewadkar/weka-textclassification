            The Celica: one of Toyota's flagship car models for at least 30 years, and the 1994 model year started the 6th generation of the car, and ran through 1999. When I bought this car, I was looking for a small, sporty car. At the time, speed was not a factor. I had been considering a '94 Eagle Talon AWD Turbo, which I had test driven and fell in love with. However, the bank wouldn't approve the loan for the car, and I was left high and dry. Lo and behold a few days later, I stumble upon a 1994 red Toyota Celica coupe. I test drove it, and the next day, it was in my garage. 

The first area I'll hit is this: if you're looking for a fast car, you may want to reconsider. The 6th generation Celica is a very sleek looking car, with it's 4 headlights, and smooth curves...however, it doesn't have the power to back up the look. Most of Europe either got the modest 3s-ge engine in their cars, and the All-Trac GT4 Celica got the 3s-gte engine in their cars, which is considered to be one of the best, if not the best turbo engine ever made. North America, however, got the economy engines, shared with the likes of the Corolla. The ST model (which I own) houses the 7a-fe economy engine, with an estimated output of 110HP...the GT model has a 5s-fe, which yields about 130HP. So yes, us Americans got the shaft. "Looks fast," or so goes the campaign for the 7th generation Celica. If speed isn't your thing, keep reading. 

The upside is that the car is one of the most reliable around. I am the second owner of the car, and the odometer is about to roll around to 100,000 miles. Not a single problem with the car. I do keep up with maintanance...and basic things: oil change every three months. Other than that, in the 3 years I've owned it I've only gotten new tires, and a new battery for it (and a new paintjob, if that counts). Everyday I get in it, and turn the key, it starts as if it is brand new. The only thing I'm anticipating right now is a new clutch in the near future - but thats a given after 100,000 miles.

The interior is very nice. The seats are really quite comfortable, and mold to your back. The drivers seat is like a cockpit. All of the controls such as the A/C, radio and clock are angled towards the driver, so you're kinda enclosed in your own cockpit, while the passenger has their own area. The emphasis is on the driver. The back seat leaves much to be desired, but remember, this is supposed to be a sports car (even if the engine is underpowered). You can seat 2 people in the back, but thats not to say it will be comfortable.  All of the controls are right there for the driver.  The climate control involves push buttons with an LED to control the air-flow, defroster, and rear window defroster.  For the temperature there is a dial, as usual.  An LED clock is at the top of the center console, and another minor but handy feature is the hazard light button, right next to the clock, as opposed to the steering column.  Both your blinkers, headlights and wiper blade controls are located nicely on the steering column for easy access.  The rear defroster is a nice addition.  Simply a set of thin wires strewn across the rear window that heat up when you turn them on, and it melts the frost and fog off the window in no time.  The main defroster leaves much to desire.  It's a known issue that the windows in this car fog up very easily, and it's annoying when the defroster only leaves you a little space to see out.  But thats just a small issue.

If you need a car for going long distances, this would be a good choice.  As I mentioned, the car has a 7a-fe economy engine.  I'll pry into my personal life a bit more to give you an idea of what kind of gas mileage this car gets.  I was in a long distance relationship last summer, and it involved a 120 mile round trip.  After filling the tank full, and going 60 miles, the needle barely sunk under the full mark.  After returning home, the needle was just below the quarter tank mark.  So, esseintially I got 120 miles on a quarter tank, and almost 500 on a full tank.  The car is rated around 30 MPG on the highway, and 25 MPG for city driving, which I believe is pretty acurate.  I put $5 worth of gas in every two weeks, and that does me fine. 

This is one of the best handling cars I've ever driven. The car is a front wheel drive car, and it makes for good handling, rain, shine, or snow.  The car is very nimble.  This may or may not be one of the reasons they built the WRC GT-4.  It takes corners like a charm, with little or no oversteer.  This is one of those cars that you dream about taking down a twisty mountain road.  After driving in my Celica for quite a while, I had to learn to take it easy in my mother's Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The brakes are very responsive...not "spongey" like other cars: very stiff, and bring you to a stop very well.  The ST model somes with disc brakes in front, and drums in back.  The GT has discs all around.  Also, to the best of my knowledge, both models come with anti-lock brakes.

The 5-speed transmission shifts very smoothly, and is very responsive.  The stock Toyota clutch is very strong, and after almost 100,000 miles it engages at the right time: no slippage.  The gear ratios are pretty good, although when cruising on the highway (75 MPH+), a 6th gear would have been handy to keep things smooth and quiet.  Cruise control I believe, is an option on the car that I do have.  Setting cruise is as simple as pushing one button, and moving one lever, both in the same spot ont he steering wheel, so that's a plus. Overall, I love this car, and wouldn't trade it for anything. I'll keep it as long as I can. And you can't beat the looks you get driving down the road: some people have thought my car is brand new. When I tell them it's a '94, their jaws drop. Very good looking, reliable, and fun car to drive. I'd reccomend one anyday.
