            My girl friend recently purchased a new Camaro with a six cylinder engine. I love the car even though I am a Mustang fenatic. I was very pleased with the performance of the vehicle. She traded in a new Mustang for the Camaro and I can honestly say that it was a good trade. She was looking for a sleek sports car and she found it. Now she just wishes that she had purchased the Z 28. We love the performance that the Camaro offeres. It has quite a bit of pep to its step. When you need the power it is there. The car also rides smoothly and corners like a dream. The only thing we don't like about the Camaro is the gas it eats because of her heavy foot. It also lacks rear seating for passangers. I don't think there are words to describe how you feel when you drive the Camaro but I will say that you are sitting on top of the world. I think that vehicle is for anyone who wants to have a little fun on the road. And yes if you are behind the wheel of a Camaro you will be have some fun.<br><br>
