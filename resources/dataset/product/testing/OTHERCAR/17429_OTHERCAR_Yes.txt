            I recently bought a '99 Honda Passport (Black color :) and instantly when I went test driving, I noticed the awesome power and control. My old mazda pickup felt like a toy after the ride. I mean, how can you compare? A V6 engine compared to an old 4 cylinder. Well after my purchase, I decided to take it out for a cruise, and what a cruise it was! There were the nice features such as the sky roof, decent speakers for loud music, and turning control. Of course, I noticed a bit too much turning control but in time, I got used to the awesome power-steering great for fishtailing ;). The service is even great, for they recalled all passports in my area to fix a problem that could have caused me to crash. (Too much paint in the real axle)

2000 miles later, I still feel the same way as I did when I took it for a test drive the first time, the power and the adrenaline rushes. The car even has multi uses such as going up the mountains for a day of skiing, passing slow people on the highway, or even taking all your friends out to lunch. (Not that a wise move) The interior is homey, the power windows allow easy airing for days that are hot (When you want to save your A/C) and it even comes with a car alarm for security. This is a good car to buy, consider it, for not only is it powerful, it looks good and has a brand name.
