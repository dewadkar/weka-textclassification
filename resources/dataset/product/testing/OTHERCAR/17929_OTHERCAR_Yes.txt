            I inherited this car this past July, and I love it.  It's got all the safety features you could ever want, seatbelt pre-tensors, dual front and side airbags, seatbelts for 5 people, 4 wheel anti-lock breaks.  Safety was one of my major concerns and this car satisfies all my wants in that area.  
Amenities are great too, the XLS model has leather interior, moon roof, 170 watt 7 speaker stereo with subwoofer, power seats, seat warmers, pseudo-wooden trim.  It's also got the standard features you'd expect on such a great sedan; cruise, overdrive, and a great acceleration booster feature.  
The V6 engine provides more power than I could ever need, and the anti-lock breaks work wonderfully.  The car handles very smooth, and long highway trips are just as enjoyable as short inner-city ones.  The car accelerates like it's much smaller and lighter than it is, but it feels solid when driving.  
Everything is tight, even after the first 20,000 miles the car still feels and looks brand new.  
Gas mileage is great, and the 18.5 gallon tank is more than adequate for even the longest trips.
The car was purchased new in 1998 at just over $31,000, it now Blue Books at just under $27,000, the car really keeps its value, and is worth every penny.
For the safety features, the amenities, and the Toyota name, you can't beat this car.  The Toyota Camry has been the #1 selling car in America for the last 3 years, the Avalon is just the nicer version of the Camry, so spoil yourself.  As far as car investments go, you can't go wrong with the way the Avalon retains it's value.
