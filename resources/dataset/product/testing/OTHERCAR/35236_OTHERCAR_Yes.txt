            Imagine my dismay when I learned that my wife and newborn triplets were almost stranded in our minivan due to a bad transmission.  I promptly began looking for a more reliable vehicle.  I found the Trooper

My problem was that I lived in Idaho and wanted to have the assurance of four wheel drive to help me through the snow storms.  I also needed plenty of room to haul our HUGE triplet stroller.  The other SUVs in the Troopers class just didn't have the room to carry it without some disassembly, but the trooper did.  I also have no problem lining up three toddler seats on the back seat.

We have a 1994 model and it had 100,000 miles when we bought it, now we have been driving it for over a year and haven't had a single problem.  I rest much more easily when my wife goes out alone with the kids.

There are a number of things that I think have been remedied on later models.  The four wheel drive is not &quot;shift on the fly&quot;, you have to plan for use.  We have a standard transmission, and a stiff gas pedal.  This sometimes gives a little whiplash if you forget which car you are in. Other than that, I am very satisfied with my purchase.

Since it has a lot of head room, the roof rides a little higher than most other SUVs in it's class, so if you are driving in a windstorm, you really feel it.  I like the way it drives, it is smooth, even at 80 MPH, but the steering is a little looser than I prefer.  What do you expect with 120,000 miles?  

My wife has no problems driving it either, it is large enough to carry everything we need, but small enough to be able to park in any normal spot.  I think about anyone could drive this vehicle.<br><br>
