            This car or should I call it truck has many positives. As one of the biggest vehicles on the road the driver sees the road from a better vantagepoint than most other cars and trucks even. The suburban is a powerhouse of a car capable of taking its driver on anything from an offroad journey to a short weekend getaway. With its 8 seats and large trunk it has plenty of room for most families and their luggage.It also has luxurious features like heated front seats and rear control for the air conditioning system. It is a great car but you have to be willing to pay the price for it. It not only costs alot to buy but it only gets around 13 m/g in town and maybe 16 m/g on the highway.<br><br>
