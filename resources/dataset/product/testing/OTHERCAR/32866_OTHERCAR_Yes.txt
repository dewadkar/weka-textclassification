               I've been looking for digital cameras for a long time. My first digital camera was a piece of crap. It was a cheap, Mustek VDC-100. I bet it was one of the first digicams ever made. It had no screen, the batteries would fall out, no flash, most pictures would be pitch black. It's resolution was 320*240. This time I spent a lot more time and money researching and buying.

   I researched a lot. Since I've always loved Nikon, it was my favorite choice. I looked at the coolpix 950 and it was pretty good. I didn't like the design and the 2.1 meg. Then I looked at the 990, it was wonderful but I still didn't like the design and the price was pretty high. My second brand I like is Canon, so I saw the S110, it was too small and looked and felt like a toy. The G1 was very nice! I probably would have gotten it if it costs the same as the 880. The G1's size was just right and it looked great. I especially liked the flip out lcd screen. 

   I went to the store and saw the 880 and compared it thoroughly with the G1. Quality was my number 1 priority because I want this camera to last a very long time. The 880 is definitly better in quality. It has a solidity that the Canon just didn't have. It felt right in my hands. From the review's and the samples I thought the Canon has better picture quality but only by a slim margin. The Nikon's picture quality is good enough for most purposes. Finally, Canon costs 120 more so I decided to buy the Nikon.

   The camera is great! The colors are accurate, the pictures are sharp. The screen is a little small but being able to zoom in and scroll around in a picture is soooo cool! The batteries went dead after 2 days of use. I'm  getting a recharger set for 100$. The software did't work so I asked my dad to fix it cause he's a computer programmer. He fixed it! The software is just crap. You can't manipulate the images in any way. I guess Nikon thought it would've been easier to make a good camera and bad software. I'm still very happy with it and the images are great. I need new software though. The camera is easy to use. I really like the scene mode. Being able to use manual in a digital camera is really cool!
