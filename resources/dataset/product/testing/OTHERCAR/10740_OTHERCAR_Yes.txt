            We didn't know until we picked up our Tribute that it was the Zoom Zoom car. Even though I watched the Olympics, I never put two and two together. So, now when we have to decide if it's mom or dad's car, we say are we taking the Zoom Zoom? Anyway, we got our Tribute at the end of October. We thought an SUV with good gas mileage didn't exist, until we saw the Tribute. Our dealer had a Four cylinder model, and that's all we ever drive. We are not used to zippy vehicles. 

The 4 cylinder model is more than adequate for highway driving and &quot;zooming&quot; around town. It has good pick-up and like other authors have noted, it is extremely smooth and quiet. We have one of the rare versions, which also has a 5 speed transmission. Living in a cold, snowy climate, this can be better for us anyway.

The car is very comfortable, though we haven't yet taken any long drives in it. The gas mileage has been approximately 27 mpg. We haven't experienced any problems with the vehicle.

The CD player and radio have good sound. One thing about the Tribute is that it has storage areas everywhere inside. There is plenty of room for your CD's, tokens, coffee cups, water bottles, books, etc. We are very happy with the interior design.
