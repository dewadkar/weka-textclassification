            I absolutely love my New Beetle.  It is without a doubt the best car I have ever owned.  I warn you, I am biased and a total VW fan.  This is my 5th VW I have owned.  I am also from a VW family, my brother, sister, and nephew have all owned or currently own at least one VW.  

I was lucky enough to buy a White TDI (turbo-diesel injection).  The TDI has more torque than the gasoline engine�so the off the line performance is VERY good.  I can burn the tires in first and second.  Not bad for a diesel.

Besides the perfection in the styling, my favorite feature is the mileage.  I average over 40 mpg and have gotten as much as 51 mpg on a long road trip.  I laugh at the SUV crowd at the fuel stations.  The TDI has everything.  GREAT pick up from a dead stop, strong mid-speed acceleration for passing or just getting away from someone whose driving is driving me crazy.  Just in case you are wondering�it is a fast car as well.  The fastest I have ever driven the car is 110 mph, and my baby car was solid as a rock.

There is an amazing amount of room in the front seat.  I have several friends well over 6 feet tall, and they are always stunned by the headroom.  Sure the back seat is small, big enough for two adults for a short trip around town�or small adults/children on a longer trip.

The styling is wonderful.  I love the feeling of room in the interior of the car.  Everyone has seen the exterior, so there isn�t really much need to go on and on about the exterior, except to say it is one of the most beautifully styled cars on the road.  The interior is very well designed, the single instrument cluster is reminiscent for the original VW, the much talked about bud-vase is really a nice way to add your own touch to the car.  Great stereo from the factory and a CD player in the trunk.  And wait until you see the dash lights at night�Bright red, and indigo-blue.

It is a beautiful car, it is a safe car, it is a fuel efficient car, it is just plan fun to drive.
