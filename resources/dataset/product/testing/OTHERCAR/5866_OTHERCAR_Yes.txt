            The Acura 3.2TL Type S is an excellent value.  Understand that this car is built off of the global Accord platform.  In fact, the TL shares some 45% of its components with the Accord.  

The TL type S has a stronger engine, 260 horsepower vs. 225 hp.

It has bigger wheels, 17 inch vs. 16 inch and a slightly modified suspension.  

The ride is relatively quiet, and although you hear the engine if you push it hard, it is pleasing growl.  The double wishbone suspension is more sophisticated than a simpler McPherson-strut suspension.  

According to Acura, the 2001 TL has had over 500 changes to it.  Many are subtle like improved brake feel.  A friend of mine has an older 3.2TL and the 2001 definitely does feel more luxurious.  

Expect that this car will retain its value quite well because it is relatively cheap and comes fully loaded.  The only option is the navigation system.  

Overall, I would highly recommend this car because it is not that hard to rationalize over a top of the line Accord or Camry.  It's prettier, more powerful and has a longer warranty than either traditional family sedan, though with less backseat room.
