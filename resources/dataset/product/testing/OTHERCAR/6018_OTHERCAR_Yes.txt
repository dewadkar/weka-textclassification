            I bought this vehicle in November of 1999, and I have to say that all I do is smile when I drive it. It has reasonable power, is heavy and very stable at all speeds. I have the Sport Quattro, which only comes with a 5-speed transmission. The Audi engines and transmissions are quite smooth and are very durable, based on first-hand experience of about 10 vehicles.  Living in the Northeast, the Quattro was the main motivation to purchase this vehicle. It is excellent in the wet and snow.

The visibility is good from the driver's seat, though the rear head restraints can obscure some of the rear view. The car is very quiet at highway speeds...enough that I will sometimes find that I haven't shifted into 5th gear at 60mph. The radio/cassette is good, the heated seats are great. Instrumentation is excellent, with a full set of gauges, including tachometer, oil temperature, oil pressure and voltage. The real walnut trim is especially nice.

I would recommend this car to someone that knows how to work on their own vehicles and enjoys driving. The parts for these cars are very expensive, particularly if you go the the dealership. I needed to replace the timing belt when I bought the car. The other recommended parts include the water pump, serpentine belt, tensioners and thermostat. If I had this done at the dealership, it would have cost $1000. I was able to do it in an afternoon for $300. I have a leaking power steering hose. The hose cost $270 from the dealership. You can't keep feeding the leak either, because the synthetic hydraulic oil is about $13/liter. Parts can be bought cheaper on-line.

I would not recommend this car to someone that wants sports-sedan status with Honda Accord maintenance. I have no doubt that this car will make it to 250-300k miles, but it will have its share of gremlins along the way. I'm sure there are Asian offerings that fit the needs of others.

Another nice feature of this car (mine is a 1995) is that in 1996, Audi replaced the 90 with the A4. So the 1995 90 represents the last and presumably most reliable model year of this series. Also, since everybody wants the A4 now, the 90's can be had very cheaply. Keep in mind that Audis depreciate quickly, so buying used is a good policy. Keep them for a long time and you will be happy...and perhaps a little poorer.<br><br>
