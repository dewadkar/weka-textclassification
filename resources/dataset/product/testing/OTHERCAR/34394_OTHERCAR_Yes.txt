            The Catera is a fun car.  In the near luxury class the choices are limited and I wanted something American made (although I now know that Opel makes them in Germany).  The car is fun, solid and comfortable.  All of the comforts found in more expensive models are standard including: Dual Climate control, power sunroof, traction control, leather, and heated mirrors!  The seats are designed to allow a large person to have plenty of leg room.  

I love the handling and responsive engine especially when manually shifting the transmission.  The Catera has rear wheel drive, this makes the car handle like some of the old sports cars but make sure that you disable the Traction Control if you are heavy on the gas pedal.  

I do not like that the controls for the power windows are located by the gear shift.  They do have the &quot;one touch - up or down &quot; but are clumsy to reach. 

The Bose system is fantastic.  The system has enough volume to hurt anyone's ears but the music even at high volume still sounds great.

Overall, the Catera is a good car, performs as advertised and has been extremely solid.  The only real problem is the cup holder that folds into the arm rest seems (and is) cheap - it broke twice!
