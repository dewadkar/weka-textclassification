            I went searching for a digital camera about 3 months ago.  It's not an easy task.  I mean were talkin megapixels and resolution, image enhancement technology and battery consumption. And unfortunately you really have to research it because these things aren't cheap.  So anyway, I ended up with the CL-50.  One because it was one of the most affordable cameras with 1.3 megapixels and it was rated one of the highest as far as photo quality by Consumer Reports.  Turns out it was a good choice.  I guess I got lucky because normally I'm the kinda guy who wants bells and whistles, especially for $700(this was a couple of months ago, I think their cheaper now).  This one's kinda plain lookin, but dont let the looks fool you, it does everything.

<b>Photos</b> - first of all, the photos are unbelievable clear.  I was really surprised how great these really were.  

<b>Memory</b> - It comes with an 8 meg card and I had considered buying a larger card to hold more photos.  Since I'm a web designer though, all my photos can be taken in a medium resolution.  So how many pictures can I take on 1 card?  Almost 100!  I mean God-Almighty I've got a better chance of the batteries going dead before the memory runs out.

<b>Flash</b> - Pretty much like your above average film camera, you know theres just not a lot more you can do with that.  Your run of the mill red-eye, on and off.

<b>Energy Saving Features</b> - If you use the big digital screen on the back of the camera for taking photos and viewing them the batteries can go quick so this turns out to be a big deal.  It has a cool little lid that pops up over the screen.  If you are in the sun you can open that lid and let the sunlight light up your screen instead of using the installed light; this saves a ton of juice.

<b>Options</b> - Chalked full.  Before you take the pictures you have a million different options you can play with: rapid fire photo(shoots like 8 pictures in a matter of seconds), 5 and 10 second timer, and light background just to name a couple.  There are just as many options after the picture is taken.  For instance, you can add sound to each pic if you want.

<b>Playback</b> - The screen is nice and big for instant playback.  You have the option of running a slide show, seeing 1 pic at a time, or showing 12 pics at one time.

<b>Software</b> - Easy to install and run.  Once installed simply connect the cord from your camera to an open port and click 'get pictures' on the program.  The program is easy to use and fully functional - it even has a way to make an unending panoramic photo.

The only thing I can recommend is buying the rechargeable batteries for it, regular alkaline dont last very long<br><br>
