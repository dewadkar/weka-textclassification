            Picked up the 2003 CLK 500 while shopping for a 2004 CLK 320.  My advice to anyone looking at the 2 door coupe class automobile, DO NOT drive the CLK 500 unless you intend to buy it.  It's like a puppy, if you take it home, it's yours.

Superbly manufactured, with the interior trim and fit you would expect from MB.  The engine is nothing short of magnificent, with a distinct rumble (much, much different than the CLK 320), and a lot of torque, particularly in the middle RPMs.  Handles firm, with a lot of control and no perceptible understeer.  Gives you confidence into curves that could get you in trouble if you're not careful.  I got the brilliant silver finish, with charcoal gray leather.  Really nice.

Control placement is clean and easy to interpret - I wasn't a fan of the sliding levels for temperature and gasoline at first, but they are so easy to read, I've changed.  I can't imagine red-lining the tach; it might lead to insanity.  How could you get there?  Comfortable seats, with very effective seat heaters.  Controls for the climate control are on the center console and easy to deal with.  I particularly love the information screen on the center of the speedometer.  Driver controlled screens can depict the odometer, range, radio settings, CD information, malfunctions, phone functions, you name it.  Every inch of the automobile can be controlled by toggles on the wheel.  Very nice.

I got the bi-xenon headlamps, and all I could say when I fired them up the first evening was "Oh my lord".  Almost daylight.  Very bright, and quite useful on country roads with deer along the side.  

Power is plenty.  No problem getting up to speed, passing on the interstates, and getting around haywagons.  Steering is very effective.  Brakes are actually better than anything I have driven, including a number of very expensive sports sedans.  The authority and absence of fade is just something you must experience.  A favorite on this car.  Visibility is superb.  The absence of the b-pillar lets you see all around.  

Problems?  Back seat room is just adequate.  Adult passengers probably won't want to ride for hours.  Kids don't mind it, and actually like it.  Trunk is just adequate, but that's not why I bought the car.  The exterior trim isn't placed right for avoiding dings in parking lots with other drivers who don't share your respect for their car.  Loves, and I mean loves high test gasoline.  No awards for fuel efficiency.
