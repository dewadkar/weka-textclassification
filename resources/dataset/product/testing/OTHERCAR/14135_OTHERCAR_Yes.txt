            If you have read my previous opinion on Ebay, then you know that my husband and I have been selling a lot of stuff in the hopes of saving plenty of money to visit Canada in August.  In the process of learning how to sell things on Ebay, we discovered that items sold better if the listing included a picture.

My sister had just received a Fuji FinePix 1300 Digital Camera for Christmas and she let us borrow it.  Her fiance says he purchased it at Circuit City for $250.00.  This seemed like a cheap price for a digital camera, but we found out that it works pretty well.  Although, sometimes the pictures come out fuzzy or blurry.  

The camera comes with Safety Instructions, A Quick Start Guide, and an Owner's Manual.

I have not mastered all the functions of the Fuji FinePix 1300 yet, but I am learning slowly.  

The features include, but are not limited to:

SETTING THE DATE AND TIME--My sister set this before I borrowed the camera.  It still has the correct date and time.
1.Set the Mode to "Set" 
2.Switch to the SET-UP screen.
3.Use the up/down buttons to select the "DATE/TIME."
4.Press the "Menu/OK" button

TAKING PICTURES IN AUTO MODE
Set the dial to the little picture that looks like a camera.
To take pictures using the viewfinder, or the LCD Monitor, press the "DISP" button to switch the LCD monitor on.
To take the picture, press the shutter button down.  

VIEWING YOUR IMAGES-I use this feature every time I take a picture to see if it's what I wanted.
Set the mode to the arrow button that points to the right.  Use the arrow button to view each frame.

ERASING SINGLE FRAME--This feature is useful to get rid of unwanted pictures that take up space on the camera.  I have used this feature several times.
1. Set the mode to the arrow button that points to the right
2. Press the "MENU/OK" button to display the menu
3. Use the left/right arrow buttons to select "FRAME" in the "ERASE" menu.
4. Press the "MENU/OK" button.

There is also Advanced Photography features that I have not used yet.  These features include, but are not limited to:

FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY-
You can choose from 5 different flash modes.  The flash range works best in the 2.3 foot to 9.8 foot range.
1. Auto Flash-you use this for ordinary photography
2. Red-Eye Reduction-Use this feature to help get rid of the red that sometimes appears in people's eyes.
3. Force Flash-Use this feature when you want to take pictures of scenes that have a backlight.
4. Suppressed Flash-You use this when you are taking pictures in indoor lighting at distances that are too far for the flash to do any good.
5. Slow Synchro-This mode will let you use the flash with a slow shutter speed and it will let you take pictures that show the subject and the background.

CONTINUOUS SHOOTING-
When you set the continous shooting mode you can take approximately 2 shots per second and up to 9 consecutive shots.

SELF-TIMER PHOTOGRAPHY- 
The self-timer lamp lights for 5 seconds, then it blinks for 5 seconds then takes the picture.  You can use this when you want to be in the picture.

DIGITAL TELEPHOTO-
This feature will let you enlarge a portion of your picture.

I will never use most of these Advanced Options because I have no use of them for pictures listed on Ebay.  My sister has used the Self-Timer Photography option and the first picture turned out a little blurry, but the pictures she took later turned out beautifully.

In the back of the owner's manual booklet there are sections on Accessories, Notes On Using Your Camera Correctly, Notes On the Power Supply, Warning Displays, Troubleshooting, and Safety Notes.

To put the pictures onto your computer all you have to do is connect the camera and your PC using the USB cable that comes included with the camera.  The pictures come up on your computer monitor.  To save a picture just open the thumbnail image and click on "Save As."  The pictures that you don't want you can delete.  If you have a printer, you can print your pictures out.  Or, you can send them in your email, put them on your homepage, put them on Ebay, or even put them on your profile page on Epinions.

In my opinion, I think this camera works really well for the inexpensive price that was paid for it.  The blurry pictures don't really concern me too much since they can be deleted.  The only real complaint that I would have about the Fuji Finepix 1300 camera would be that the batteries don't last very long.  It requires 4 AA batteries and we have had to replace them twice in the last month.  However, we do use the camera a lot when we list things on Ebay. 

If you want a cheap digital camera that works fairly well, then I would highly recommend the Fuji Finepix 1300!
