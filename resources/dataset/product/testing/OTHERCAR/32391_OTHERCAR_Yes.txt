            I love my car. Last May my husband and I bought a Honda Civic HX primarily for my use, because we'd recently moved to an area which made it awkward to only have one car, and he really needed his Pathfinder to get to work. We had some requirements for the new vehicle that helped us to narrow down our options. First, I wanted an automatic because I'd never driven a stick shift and I didn't feel that learning on my brand new car would be appropriate. Second, we wanted the best possible gas mileage. In doing some research, we found that there were a few models with excellent gas mileage to choose from - some Volkswagens and the Chevrolet Metro topped the list, but the Volkswagens were all stick and the Metro had a tiny little engine. 

The Honda Civic, fifth on the list, looked promising, so we went to take a test drive. We went back and forth over the price - DXs were less expensive, but the mileage was best on the HX. The HX has a different kind of transmission, called Constantly Variable Transmission (CVT). It's still an automatic, but the CVT improves the mileage and also, as I discovered, allows the car to have a really smooth ride - you don't feel it changing gears, and it accelerates easily. After the test drive, I was sold. 

Of course there were other factors to consider, but in looking around I realized that everything about this car was good - the trunk is large, the front passenger seat can slide forward pretty far to make it easier to get in and back seat, and there are convenient handles by the drivers seat to pop the trunk and gas tank cover. The seats are comfortable, especially for a relatively low-priced car, and the upholstery is fine - I'm not too concerned about having anything fancy inside the car, so long as the outside looks decent (and it does - not snazzy, but definitely not ugly). I like the arrangement of the radio and heat controls; everything is within easy reach, and organized in a sensible manner. There are cup holders in the middle, below the control panel, and that's fine for the most part. One time when I wasn't paying attention to picking up my can of soda, I grabbed the very top of the can, lifted it, and whacked it against the underside of the dash, knocking the slippery can out of my hand and onto the floor and spilling my drink. Was that the car's fault? Probably not, but I do have to remind myself to be careful when lifting my drinks.

I generally get about 35 miles to the gallon while driving, but I drive on the highway a lot more than on city streets, and I'm hardly ever in traffic during rush hour. I have very little experience with driving other cars of this size, after a few years of taking turns driving our SUV, so I can't give much of a point-by-point comparison. I can emphasize the fact that of all the cars I've driven, this one has the smoothest ride and acceleration - if you're not careful, you can get up to 80 MPH without noticing! And of course, I would never, ever drive that fast on *purpose...  :)<br><br>
