                If you don't add oil you'll find out quickly why this was meant to be a 'disposable' car.  The 2.8 V6 crammed into the engine compartment is nearly impossible to remove or reinstall.  I bought this car with the intention of replacing the original motor (two thrown rods, and spun main bearings) with a fresh 'running' motor.   It occurred to me, halfway through the operation, that GM hadn't designed this car for a V6.  Ask almost any owner whose even tried to change the spark plugs on the rear side.  I saw things that are just about impossible to replace without the engine being removed; rear exhaust manifold, crossover pipe, rear oxygen sensor, etc.  All this points to very bad engineering or design.  While the cars themselves are sharp looking,  I can't even see the point of a V6 other than to impress your friends.  I didn't see much difference the V6 had over the 4-cyl anyway, except at speeds above say 65 mph.  While I've always liked the cavalier,  I would only recommend the 4-cyl.  Think about this though, what if the cavalier had been a rear wheel drive car?  Not only would it be easier to work on, but how much more fun it would be to drive?  <br><br>
