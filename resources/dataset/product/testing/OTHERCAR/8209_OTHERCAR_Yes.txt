            My parents purchased this vehicle for me in 1996. I was living in California and I needed a car to get around in. I did not have much money to spend, so I thought a small, economical car would be perfect for me. As soon as my &quot;grape&quot; arrived via car carrier, I knew that this was the car for me. This car has been cross-country 3 times and I have never had a single problem with it. I get anywhere from 30-45 mpg!!! The further you drive this car, the better the gas mileage. The gas tank only holds 11.5g, meaning that I spend around $15 to fill my &quot;grape&quot; up. I did not buy this car to drive on the Autobahn but this car handles great!!! The only con about the handling is when it is wet outside the front tires tend to slip. My mother's boyfriend owns a BMW 535i and he always asks me if he can take my car. I would have to be stupid to say no, but sometimes i do. The interior is simple but very comfortable. My vehicle came stripped, not equipped. I did ad an aftermarket stereo, since I spend the majority of my time driving it. The seats are extremely comfortable and my friends always brag about how roomy the back seats are. The only option I would &quot;kill&quot; for is power steering. For the money, there is no better deal out there. Plus the warranty is incredible, not that I have had to use it yet.<br><br>
