            First off, I have a new hobby, which is causing great distress to my wife. I love to test drive cars. I have become a salesman's nightmare. I recently visited my local Dodge dealer to spend some time with a 2001 Intrepid R/T. One word summary... Fantastic!

At only $25,000 for the R/T, it is a great value. The 3.5-liter V-6 pumps out over 240 horses of driving excitement. (Sorry for the plagiarism, Pontiac) It corners like on rails, with the standard (on the R/T) Performance Handling package. Power, leather seating makes it easy to get comfortable in its roomy interior that can adequately seat 5 adults. The big 17&quot; wheels grip the road tightly, and are assisted by the 4 wheel independent suspension. The trunk is a spacious 18 cu.ft., meaning 3-4 suitcases, or a stroller and groceries, in real life terms. As large as one who isn't looking at Vans or SUVs or Pick-ups would want. 

The R/T comes in 4 different colors; Inferno Red, Silver, Black, or White. Go with the Inferno Red. We're talking about a hot sports car here, don't crimp on the looks. All that tells the person next to you at the lights that something special is next to them is the small R/T emblem on the front doors. That and the special rims, but most people do not notice rims when looking for a go. 

From reading up on the car, Dodge states that one can expect 18/27 MPG in the car, which is very good for a large V-6. If I was in the market for a sports coupe, and after the winter I just may be after this fun ride, I would be seriously looking at the 2001 Intrepid R/T. The fun per buck spent scale weighs very favorably in this car. It may not be as fast as the Lincoln LSC, or be as luxurious as the Chrysler 300M, but at $10,000 to $20,000 more expensive, is it worth it? If you are looking to buy a sports car, this is a great choice.<br><br>
