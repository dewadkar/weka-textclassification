            As I approached middle-age, and with a couple of accidents well behind me I found myself cruising the car lots for a full sized sedan. I did my homework and read tons of reviews and after obsessing for many months took the plunge.


My 1995 Pontiac Bonneville is delightful. This is an ideal car for those making the transition(maybe not willingly) from two seaters and sports cars into the next stages of adulthood. My Bonneville SE is sporty,(a spoiler)classy,(leather)practical,(all the bells & whistles & V-6).
This car drives like a dream, stops on a dime, and can get up and go!

The gas mileage took a little getting used to, about twenty miles per gallon overall, and I was little surprised at how much gasoline the tank holds(must be about 18 gallons).
Probably the only thing I would change is the air conditioning/heat fan. I'm not sure it blows the air hard enough to suit me but would not let that keep me from buying another.

I would recommend this car for singles that travel, young families, and older couples. This is probably not a good first car for the teens-mine has sixteen inch tires ($90.00 each) and general upkeep may be a little high for them (i.e. tunes-ups etc).

04/15/00...I've owned the car now for close to eight months and still feel good about recommending it. There have been no repairs other than a little body work due to hurricane Floyd and the usual oil changes etc. The leather takes a little getting used to now in the warm weather and requires extra time. I'm certainly not ready to trade just yet.

10/31/00...Uh Oh...It sort of "shudders" in O-Drive around 45-55 mph. My beautiful Bonneville has been at the car hospital for several days now.  They seem to think it might be a solenoid(?) switch as the car tries to shift, but no one is sure yet. Anyone?

03/13/01...By the way, it only needed a tune-up & new plug wires.  It did, however, take several trips to the car doctor before I could get anyone to check the obvious.  Runs like a dream again!

04/25/02...Still driving the Bonneville with no problems at all. The 16 inch tires were interesting to replace and the best prices I found were online.

12/16/03...110,000 miles and still ticking.  Has been painted once and could use another (I live on the coast).  Only a few "to be expected" type of repairs, otherwise a great car.  I clearly do  not plan to trade it in!
