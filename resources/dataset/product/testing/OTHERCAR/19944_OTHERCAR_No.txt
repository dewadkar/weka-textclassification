            <i><b>2001 Chevrolet Prizm</b> catches your eye? Look again. This Chevrolet needs significant re-tooling in order to compete with the heavily competitive sub-compact market.</i>

Working part-time at my uncle's dealership does have its benefits and one of them is the opportunity to &quot;test drive&quot; cars at will, sometimes without even letting him know. Ok I'm kidding, but when I did have the opportunity to drive this car down to Alexandria, Virginia, curiosity got the better of me and I said yes.

<b>Physical Design</b>
The exterior of this car is conservatively built and remarkably resembles the 2000 Corolla. (Note: The 2001 Corolla has undergone some restyling while the 2001 Prizm has not had significant enhancements). If you are looking for a car with a sleek look I guarantee that you will be immediately turned off here. However, on the bright side, the old Volvo-like box like design with the steel monocoque frame lends a degree of structural stability to the car and you will be confident that this car is solidly built. With regards to the interior, there is obviously only so much space that a sub-compact can hold, and the Prizm is no different. If you are an adult sitting in the back, your leg-room will definitely be significantly compromised. In the front, if you are in an <b>LSi</b> you will be thankful for the adjustable steering column to improve comfort. Display settings are conservative and adequately positioned. The trunk is about average in size but accessibility is very good thanks to a large trunk opening. Visibility via the mirrors is also quite good thanks to the larger-than-the-norm mirrors. <b>Grade: C+</b>

<b>Performance and Reliability</b>
The <i>1.8-liter DOHC 4-cylinder engine</i> churns out 125Hp which is about adequate for a car of this class. Acceleration is steady and handling is actually somewhat better than my own 2000 Toyota Corolla. I did not feel like a race car driver in this car since it did not hug the curves and of course acceleration was not worthy of a sporty car, but I must admit that it is a comfortable ride and turning was smooth to the touch. This could be partly because I drove the LSi edition which has larger tires. ABS brakes were not present in this car but it is an available option. Braking was slow but steady. During my trip (mostly highway mileage), I covered about 400 miles on about 12 gallons of gas which is pretty good. The Toyota engine is an excellent indicator of reliability and you are only required to change the oil every 6000 miles. <b>Grade: B</b>

<b>Safety and Warranty</b>
As mentioned before, the steel frame surrounding the car is an effective shield and <b>NHTSA Crash Tests</b> are above average when results are compared with other cars in its category. The standard 3year/36000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty is present. However, there is no powertrain warranty. <b>Grade: B-</b>

<b>Price, Quality &amp; Resale</b>
The 2001 Prizm retails for between $13,500 to $16,000. Compare this with the Corolla which is actually <i>lower</i> in price with comparable options. Quality seems to also be a notable problem with the Prizm and most people I have talked to in the auto industry seem to agree that evidence of corners being cut is quite apparent. Engine reliability contributes to a good but not great resale value for this car. <b>Grade: D-</b>

<b>Overall Analysis</b>
Unfortunately, the Chevrolet Prizm cannot seem to shake its image of being the Toyota Corolla's illegitimate cousin. Question: If you are the previously mentioned illegitimate cousin, would you continue copying whatever the Corolla did or would you clear a path for yourself by arriving at a design that is unique and a price that will drive competitiveness into your corner? Based on the present pricing structure, design and specifications of the Prizm, the folks at Chevrolet believe the former is true.

The 1.8-liter DOHC 4-cylinder engine is manufactured by Toyota. The exterior of the car somewhat resembles a Corolla with more rigidity and the interior is carved out of a Corolla skeleton. It is also priced higher than its Toyota counterpart and its warranty is worse. Given all those facts, no wonder the Toyota Corolla outsells the Chevrolet Prizm by 4:1. The only positive mark in the Prizm's favor is that it is a somewhat more comfortable ride both for the driver and passenger(s). Given that we are talking about a sub-compact car, that is a fairly significant achievement.

In my opinion though, a car must have its own unique identity in order to continue to be successful especially in the case of a sub-compact car where buyers cannot be wooed over by pure power or comfort. The 2001 Chevrolet Prizm is unfortunately a bad reflection of the 2001 Toyota Corolla. As a result, I would recommend other cars such as the Mazda Protege, Dodge Neon or the Toyota Corolla over it. If you have your mind set on the Chevrolet Prizm, my best advice would be to &quot;inadvertently&quot; drop a hint to the salesman at your local dealership that you are also considering the Toyota Corolla. I have a feeling that they will be more willing to deal on the price :)
<b><i>Overall Grade: C-</b></i>

Good luck with your decision!<br><br>
