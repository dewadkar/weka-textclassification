            OK, I bought this car and I love it so I feel I need to pass on my epinion about it!  But, I'm not the kind of person who will wax eloquent about road hugging qualities (it has 'em) and rack and pinon steering (don't know what that is). So why did I buy it?  And what is it like?

First of all, it isn't the easiest car to buy!  I read all the reviews and was considering the SLK, the Audi TT and the Boxter.  Doing my pen to paper analysis the SLK was the clear winner.  My criteria going into the car purchase mode was 4 wheel drive and a place for my bike. At the top of the &quot;I'd also like&quot; list was convertible.   HUH?!  The Audi TT comes in a quattro version, no convertible but I could put a bike rack on top.  The dealer told me if I put my $1000 deposit down today I can get the car 5 months hence!  NOT!  The Boxter is terribly sexy and a fabulous car to drive.  Obviously no 4WD or bike space (but somewhere along the line I decided to keep my old Subaru for those times).  However, by the time I started adding up the options, the price was really pushing my budget.

Ultimately, it was the Kompressor that made my juices flow.  Next I just had to find someone who would sell me the car.  The first problem was getting someone to pay attention to me on the lot.  The sad story is that after trips to 3 dealers I brought my male buddy with me and the sales reps were on us like &quot;white on rice&quot;.  The next problem is that each lot had maybe two and they weren't in the right option/color combinations (ok, so it's a girl thing).  That took us to checking the computers for what was &quot;at the port&quot;, &quot;on the water&quot;, and just off the line.  

Mercedes had determined that it's consumers don't want standard transmissions.  Finding the Kompressor with a stick shift is nearly impossible (and then they want to sell you a green one or a copper one!)  But eventually I let my fingers do the walking and uncovered the status of every SLK in the country and on it's way to a dealer within a 75 mile radius of my home.  I also was able to determine which dealer was the most helpful and customer oriented (Autobahn Motors in Belmont, CA), which sales rep would work with me (David) and where the car I wanted was.  By letting David know where the car was and dealing with him I was even able to negotiate a 5% price reduction (in this era of Saturn style fixed pricing).

About the car.... the hard top convertible sold me.  It is so easy to open and close and I love that it is so safe.  Also, having a real back window is a huge plus.  One of the other SLK reviewers said that she liked not running into herself everywhere she goes.  I agree.  This car gets more attention (of course, that's of no importance to me) and I don't see many others on the road (not surprising as hard as they are to find).  It drives like a dream.  I catch myself going way too fast and am just waiting for someone else (CHP) to catch me doing the same.

The trunk is plenty spacious with the top up and surprisingly room with it down (fits weekend away luggage).  The only options available are the phone/cd changer, heated seats and automatic transmission (which you can't avoid!). The car is resplendent with luxurious appointments.  The car is roomy enough inside for everyone I've brought along so far.

I like the 50k mile service inclusion and the 24 hour roadside service.  Autobahn Motors treats their customers like royalty and sent me goodies after the sale.

So, maybe it's ok for me to be a grasshopper this time.  I've been an ant for years (ref: Aesop)
