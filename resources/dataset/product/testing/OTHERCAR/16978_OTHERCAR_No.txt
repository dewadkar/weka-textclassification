            This was a one-week rental for our family of six while in Florida on vacation. Climbing into the van, I was pleased to note that there was only 6,000+ miles on the odometer...rather low for a rental. 

I was impressed with its above average exterior looks for a vehicle in the mini-van category. The interior offered a plush velour fabric with thick padding and comfortable seating for seven adults. Window visibility was clear all around with no blind-spots. The ride was smooth and quiet, with quick acceleration. Remote door lock key fob (but no audible lock alert). Gas mileage seemed average for a vehicle of this size.

<b>WHAT WAS GREAT ABOUT IT:</b>

SEATING - The seats were very comfortable and roomy for our family of six. My husband is 6'4" and he had more than enough leg-room in the driver's seat and 2nd row passenger seats. The mini-van is configured with 2 bucket seats up front for the driver and passenger; 2 bucket seats in the 2nd row; 1 bench seat in the 3rd row that will accommodate up to 3 adults. I'm a good size gal and was very comfortable even in the 3rd row. The driver's seat has 2 manual controls, 1 for moving forward and back and 1 for height adjustment. The 2nd row bucket seats when folded down have cupholders and a little "table" built in that was very nice. All occupants have their own cupholder with the exception of the 3rd row middle passenger. Rear passenger seating is removable although we did not use this feature.

HEATING and A/C - There were controls for temperature and flow for the driver/passenger as well as the 2nd row. Vents were also provided for the 3rd row.

DRIVER CONTROLS - The driver's controls include an automatic door lock when put into Drive; 3rd row window vents open with a touch of a button; Interior lights; automatic closing sliding door; Dual remote driver's mirrors; cruise control.

SOUND SYSTEM - The radio was interesting as it displayed the call numbers of 'some' radio stations as well as displayed 'NEWS' and 'TRAFFIC' for 'some' radio stations that were known for such programming. Our rental included a single CD, but no cassette. Sound was great!

EXTERIOR TRIM - Exterior trim was color matched.

CARGO ROOM - More than adequate.

<b>WHAT WAS AWFUL:</b>

SEATING - The 2nd row seats take two hands to fold down to make 3rd row entry possible. One must reach behind the seat and pull a lever to move the seat forward and then pull a lever on the side to fold the seat down. Not only was this a hassle, BOTH seats (remember that this is a dual sliding door van) often became cock-eyed when moving them forward and would not fold down, we would then have to slide the seat all the way back again and start over. This must be a design fault that definitely needs to be fixed. After dealing with this problem for 3 days, the 3rd row passengers just walked between the 2nd row bucket seats and then exited the vehicle...very annoying! Another problem we noticed was that one of the 2nd row seat backs was completely off when we began our rental. The seat back is attached with 4 plastic brackets and should not have come off that easily unless someone really yanked on it. The driver's seat does not offer a lumbar support and I found it uncomfortable even driving for a short distance.

HEATING and A/C - We could not get the 2nd row control to work at all, it operated the same as the driver's control and there was no selection to let the 2nd row operate it independently. More than likely, it was broken.

DRIVER'S CONTROLS - The Interior light button had to be switched on by the driver every time someone in the back wanted a reading light. It was kind of annoying to request that the driver hit the switch every time an interior light was needed as it automatically reset when the engine was turned off.

SOUND SYSTEM - Would have liked to have seen a cassette player.

EXTERIOR TRIM - The moulding between the drivers door/door jam/sliding passenger door was twisted and could not be straightened out by hand. This didn't result in an increase of road noise, but detracted from it's looks as it was very noticeable. Poor fit and finish.
