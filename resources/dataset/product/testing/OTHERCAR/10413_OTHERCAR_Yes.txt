            After the heavy snows in the North East last winter and almost not making it home from work on a couple of evenings, I decided I needed to purchase another four wheel drive vehicle. I had owned a couple 4 x 4 trucks in the past but did not want another pick-up. I also did not want to give up the luxury and comfort I had in my present car. After I had settled on a maximum budget of $26,000, I started my search. My budget limited me to some of the smaller "cute utes" such as the Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4, Hyundai Santa Fe, and a few others such as the Nissan Exterra. None of these had what I was looking for in storage and towing capacity. I finally decided to stop at my local Jeep dealer to check out the Cherokee. My first choice had always been the Grand Cherokee Laredo, since I had friends who swore by them, but at well over $30,000 they were way above my budget constraints.

I could not justify the price for the smaller Cherokee, it just did not have the room, comfort and luxury that I wanted although the off-road capabilities were there.

As I was about to leave The salesman steered me (no pun intended) to a 1998 Grand Cherokee Laredo they had just taken in off lease. My first response was that I had no interest in a used vehicle, but he encouraged me to "just take a look". I should say here, that I had been in the automobile business for over 13 years and I know what to look for when looking at used cars. This particular GC was in absolutely "like new" condition. I do not think the rear seats had ever been sat in, the cargo net in the rear was still in the original wrapper. At three years old and under 28,000 miles it obviously still had plenty of life left in it. I agreed to take it for a test drive, even though I still wanted new. As I returned to the dealer my resolve was weakening. I went home to think about it, ran the VIN # on the internet and verified the service/accident/mileage history. Compared prices of comparable vehicles and decided on a price I would pay. Early the next morning the dealer and I settled on $18,200 including a 4 year 48,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty from Chrysler. At less than half the price of a new Grand Cherokee Laredo I had virtually the same vehicle for $8,000 under what I had planned on spending. That was in April 2001, I have now had this Jeep  for 9 months, I have put over 21,000 miles on it, including two trips to Southern Florida to visit my children, and trips every weekend from my home in Connecticut to Cape Cod, Massachusetts to play in the sand dunes and on the beach. Not to mention ski trips to Vermont this winter. This car has been absolutely trouble free, I have needed no service whatsoever other than oil changes.

As far as comfort and ride... the two trips I made to Florida were driven non-stop 21 1/2 hours each way, and the power seats with power lumbar support were amazingly comfortable, offering great lateral support and plenty of legroom and headroom for my 6' 2" frame. The ride on the highway will rival many luxury cars, although, I feel with much better handling. 

When it comes to off-road performance, well, Jeep says it all when they say they "wrote the book on four wheel drive". I have taken this vehicle just about everywhere from loose sand and foot deep mud to heavy snow and ice. Not once did I ever have to worry about getting stuck. It just claws right on through what ever you put it into. I have the "Selec-Trac" transmission with, 2 wheel high, 4 wheel part time, 4 wheel full time and 4 wheel part time low range positions. With automatic locking hubs and shift on the fly. I feel this is the best all around system Jeep makes.  

I have every option you can get in the GC with the exceptions of heated leather seats, and moonroof. The eight speaker Infinity Gold sound system delivers concert quality sound. 

This is truly a luxury car you can take anywhere. I have the 4.0 litre 6 cylinder engine which has more than adequate power and is virtually bullet proof.  My fuel economy is right at 23 MPG highway at 60 MPH, 21 MPG at 65 and 19 MPG at 70 MPH. I average between 15 and 17 around town.

What don't I like about my Jeep? Actually not much. The placement of the full size spare tire, mounted on the left side wall in the rear, takes up a lot of storage room, but also makes it very easy and clean to get to even when the cargo area is full. The 1999 model has moved the spare to under the rear deck, which gives more cargo room but also means you may have to unload cargo to get to it. All in all this vehicle more than meets my expectations for roomy, comfortable transportation in all, or even, no road, conditions.
