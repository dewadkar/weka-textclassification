            My Husband and I leased a 1998 Malibu LS in September 1997.  Since having it we absolutely love it.  It is a great car for the money.  Since leasing it we had a baby and the room that the car has for all of the baby stuff it great.  This is the first car that we had that has four doors and it is so easy to get our daughter in and out of the back seat.  It seats five comfortably but in our case in would hold four adults plus the car seat.  The trunk space has alot of room that things are just not thrown in but could be put in neat and kept neat.  It is so easy to drive and handle in any type of weather.  It drives so nice and smooth.  The gas mileage is good to and does not cost that much to fill the tank anywhere from $12 to $15 which is not bad for a luxury car.  What I really like is that it has bucket seats, which gives it a sporty look, because having a toddler back there it is easy to get to her and see her when she drops something.  We have it in the tan color which gives it a nice classy look.  People with a family or people who are thinking about having a family and looking for a new car should really consider the Malibu.  But you really dont have to have a family to own and like the Malibu because this car is really for everyone.<br><br>
