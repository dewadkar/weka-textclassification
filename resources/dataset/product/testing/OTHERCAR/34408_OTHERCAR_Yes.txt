            This car is a definite surprise in any market.  I have been driving a Mitsubishi Eclipse for the last two years and was looking for a car to replace it.  I looked for acura, supra, and camero; but couldn't make a choice until I noticed this Tiburon.  I am a student; therefore I don't have much to spent.  I purchased this car at $11,000 with premium package (which is a great deal), at 1500 miles.  I can guarantee no other car can beat the price with such quality.  The physical appearance is great with smooth transaction between door and sides.  The interior design is excellent, and was made by some famous car designer, Hyundai paid big bucks for it.  Air condition is more powerful than my previous Eclipse.  Radio is somewhat decent.  The car is somewhat low in height-wise, but still very comfortable.  I am looking to use this car for any purposes.  <br><br>
