            In the early 1990s, DC Comics decided to kill off Superman, once its most popular super hero due to faltering sales of its Superman comics and magazines. With the announcement of Superman's death at the hands of a villain called &quot;Doomsday,&quot; sales of the character's comics took off. Superman was later resurrected and is still with us today.

Last month I heard the terrible news that, in two or three years, General Motors will cease production of the Oldsmobile. If Daimler-Chrysler's decision to cast Plymouth adrift wasn't catastrophic enough; losing Oldsmobile is absolutely apocalyptic. Oldsmobile manufacturers three of the best cars in their respective classes - the compact Alero, the mid-size Intrigue, and the luxury Aurora. Olds also offers a beautiful SUV - the Bravada with its unique front-end design. Olds other offerings are the competent Cutlass models and Royale. 

Oldsmobile is America's oldest car maker, founded in 1897. Oldsmobile has, among other things, introduced the automatic transmission, the first modern overhead valve V-8, and the first successful front-wheel drive car, the Toronado, to the American public. As recently as 1977, Olds alone sold 1 million cars annually on the strength of the Cutlass Supreme, then the most popular car in the US. Olds experienced its fall from grace during the 1980s and early 1990s. By 1992 rumors were flying about Olds' doom. Fortunately, Olds renaissance came with the beautiful Oldsmobile Aurora. The Aurora's influence over the remainder of Olds' lineup is reflected in the Alero and Intrigue. 

Yesterday, I got the chance to test-drive and very nearly purchased a 2001 Oldsmobile Aurora. This car had a flawless bronze metallic finish and beautiful 16 inch cast aluminum wheels. The interior was medium gray leather with genuine wood trim throughout. 

This particular car had the 215 hp 3.5 litre transversely mounted V-6 engine mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission. I understand that Olds also offers a 4.0 litre V-8. The V-6 gave the car a lot of get-up and go. I imagine the V-8 must really make the Aurora live up to Olds' rocket image. Handling was spectacular. I hardly noticed any body roll and there virtually was no torque-steer effect. The ABS brakes stop the car on a dime. 

If there is something that is really awesome about the Aurora, it's the cockpit-like instrument panel with its aircraft-inspired instrumentation. It's simply a work of art. The dashboard just surrounds you and presents its jewel-like round sporty-looking speedometer, tachometer, temperature and fuel gauge with delicate white numerals on a black background and slim chrome rims. I only wish the car also had an ammeter and oil pressure gauge as well. The AM/FM stereo with CD and cassette are angled toward the driver and give unparalleled sound quality. The heater and air conditioning are both efficient and effective with large easy to understand controls. Redundant controls for the radio and heater are mounted on the steering wheel spokes. One doesn't need to take his or her eyes off the road to adjust the interior climate or select a favorite radio station. The gearshift selector is floor-mounted in an elegant woodgrain and pewter-aluminum panel. 

The heated leather seats were extremely comfortable with lumbar adjustments. Rear seat room was generous with a pass-through to the trunk for long, thin cargo such as skis. The trunk looks deceptively small from the outside, but is quite huge in reality. The restyled rear end of the car is far more attractive than the previous generation Aurora's rear that I felt looked too much like that of a mid-70s Trans Am.  Unfortunately the car's spare was stupid donut tire that is really out of place in such a fine car as the Aurora. I really think Olds should supply a full-size spare for its finest.  

I came very close to purchasing the Aurora. I currently drive a 1994 Cadillac Sedan Deville and the Aurora made my car seem positively old-fashioned. The price I was offered was also a bargain at only $27,000. Normally, the V-6 Aurora goes for about $34,000. What stopped me? Well, although the car really tested my loyalty to Cadillac, the Aurora is not a Cadillac and this one didn't have the V-8 to which I've become accustomed. I also have somewhat conservative taste in a car's styling and found the Aurora's grille-less front end a bit odd. Second of all, it was a bad time of year. I understand that the last two weeks of December are perhaps the best time to get a deal on a car, but I, like so many others was tapped-out from the holidays. It was the right thing at the wrong time. If only this happened in March or April...

Anyway, I recommend anybody considering a near-luxury car, domestic or foreign, take a long serious look at the Aurora. It may change the way you think of Oldsmobile. If everybody forgot their prejudices about Oldsmobiles being elderly people's cars and gave this truly fine line-up of cars a chance, Olds would come roaring back.

Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Oldsmobile!<br><br>
