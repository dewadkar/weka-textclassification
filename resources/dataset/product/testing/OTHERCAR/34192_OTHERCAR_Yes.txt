            When I was shopping for a car, I was looking for a nice sporty V6 powered car. So I decided to take a Passat GLS V6 tiptronic for a spin.

OUTSIDE:

This is by no means an ugly car, but then again I did not find it distinctive. It looks like a bigger Jetta, or I guess you can say that the Jetta is just a bigger Passat. I like cars that make a statement and the Passat kinda blends in traffic.

INSIDE:

I have to hand it to VW, the inside of the Passat looks very nice. The wood trim touches give the car some class. But the interior is not very user friendly, there is very little storage places and all the buttons are tiny. I found the leather seats to be too hard and uncomfortable. I also felt that a car of this price should have power seats (only the top of the line GLX has power seats). To move the seat back you have to turn a knob on your left which means reaching your arm back and twisting...again rather archaic for a car this of this price.

THE DRIVE:

Although the Passat is certainly is more enjoyable to drive than a Camry or a Accord this car is no sport sedan. Body roll is evident and the suspension is too springy. This car would benefit from a sport package. The Tiptronic is a very nice feature, but to me it was more a novelty than something I would find really useful...call it what you like the car is still an automatic. The V6 on the Passat is a strong engine, but it could benefit from some extra low end torque.

SUMMARY:

The Passat had some nice features, but I was not sold on it. VW has had a bad reputation when it come to reliability, and a bumper to bumper warranty (2yr/24K miles) that is lower than the industry standard did not reassure me. To make matters worse, the more I read about the Passat the more I found folks having problems with them.  I finally bought a 2K Nissan Maxima SE, which I love!.
