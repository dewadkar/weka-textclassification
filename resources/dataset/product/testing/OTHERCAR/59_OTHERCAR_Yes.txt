            This car is a great car.  From the head rests to the steering wheel it is definitely a great piece of art.  The designers at Mercedes did a great job creating this vehicle.  The handling is great on it.  The key is a great help because you can unlock and lock your doors with it.  Also, it can open your trunk and send off a siren.  It has great tracking and suspension.  Although these cars might be a little out of most people's price range they're definitely worth every cent of the money you spend on them.<br><br>
