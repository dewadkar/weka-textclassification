            I bought the PDR-M60 because it looked like good value for money at the time. It had features and specifications of cameras $200 or more in price. I loaded up the 4 size AA batteries supplied and excitedly began going through the full user manual supplied on CD Rom. I watched in horror as the battery indicator dropped with each little experiment I performed. Within 20 minutes of experimenting the batteries were flat. I loaded up a set of duracel ultras and continued experimenting. Within an hour they were flat as well. In that period I must have taken about 20 photographs.
I think I must have bought a lemon as the camera was unable to perform certain features that I would consider basic.For example: I could not delete images off the camera using the PC software. After using the camera to perform deletions I found that the space was not being cleared from the smartmedia card. I had to format the smartmedia each time to clear the space. I returned the camera to the retailer and exchanged it for another brand that I'm very happy with.
