<TEXT>
            We bought a new 1999 SLS because it was the quietest $40,000 car we test drove.  The only car that appeared to be quieter was the big Lexus, but that was another $15K.  We drove both the SLS and the STS and found the SLS to be quieter both in terms of road noise and power train noise.

The downside of the Cadillac is its build quality.  Our car came with several defects (mechanical, electrical, and cosmetic), some of which the dealer has yet to fix correctly (8 months after purchase).  The dealer's attitude is also problematic in that they don't seem interested in solving the problems.  They keep coming up with excuses like &quot;the new parts didn't look right and had to be reordered&quot;, or &quot;the parts got sent back&quot;.

If Cadillac could improve their build quality and give their dealers some training in customer relations, they would have a much better product to offer.<br><br>
