            If you are like me and have appreciated Audi's in the past, when no else did, you can really appreciate the products they have put out as of late.  For those of us that had purchased S4s in the early and mid 90's they were a real hoot to drive.  Most of us have held on to these cars even after 6 figures showed up on the odometer as we were awaiting an equal replacement.  The last 6 months have been kind to us in that the new and improved (albeit smaller)s4 and the A6 2.7T have hit the local dealerships.  The twin turbo with the six speed is a nice setup and works well in both cars. The S4 was my original choice but I need some room so  I bought the A6 2.7T as I liked the size.  The A6 2.7T will accomplish what the previous S4 did but gets there differently. The S4/S6 had the best seats of ANY factory mass produced car made.  The suspension was great as it was matched up to some nice fat tires.  When the turbo came on it pushed you back into your seat with a great sound from the engine and you really felt as if you were accomplishing something.  The new A6 2.7t has the power part down but it does it so quietly you don't know it is happening until you are there.  Audi teases you in this car as it gives you the engine and transmission,tremendous brakes, an adequate suspension but no shoes. The 215/65/16 wheels and tires are a bit frightening going into or coming out of your favorite entrance/exit ramp.  I would be interested to know if anyone else has been confronted with the same issues and what (if anything) they are doing about it.<br><br>
