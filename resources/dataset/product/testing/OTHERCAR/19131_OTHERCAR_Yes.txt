            Everyone told me to buy a Camry and its a great reliable car, but then I took the Passat for a spin and was hooked. I drove a BMW for 16 years and wanted a great car without an expensive price tag. The Passat has so many great design features..a side mirror that tilts when you go in reverse so that you can see where your tires are when backing up, tie downs in the trunk so things don't go rolling around, rain-sensors in the windshield so the wipers go one by themselves. It feels heavy and luxurious like a BMW and grips the road like a sports car. The Techtronics gear shift is fantastic. It gives you the options of automatic and manual transmission.If you need a sudden burst of power, it's there to help manuver in dicey driving conditions.  Once again, driving is fun !!! In contrast the Camry felt like driving a metal box, the automatic transmission seemed sluggish compared to the Techtronic transmission. It took turns poorly and felt light weight (although it weighs the same as the Passat) as its center of gravity seemed too high. I also checked out the Lexus and it felt pretty much like the Camry. It didn't have the very neat design features I mentioned above and the rear seat did not fold completely down so allow access to the trunk like the Passat does. I can even fit my bicycle in the trunk of the Passat. Volkswagan has terrific service and I am just thrilled with this car.<br><br>
