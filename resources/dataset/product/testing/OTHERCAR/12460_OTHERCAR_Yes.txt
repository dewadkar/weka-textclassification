            I have driven my friend's Volvo S40 myself and I'm really amazed compare to what I once owned a Volvo 740 turbo. This car is a sleek, new looking Volvo ever. It's made for younger generation, the consumer group which Volvo has been missing for a while.
The car itself judges by the look is very appealing but if I could ask for 1 think that would be the 15&quot; rim to 16&quot; and tires. That would result in a better road handling and the connectness to the road.
Steering is light and sometimes floaty. The seats are comfortable but it's not very roomy inside but in its class it would be just fine.
The S40 is powered by 160hp turbocharged engine that I, sometimes, feel it lacks of pick up especially when you entering a highway. The power doesn't really come in until you hit about 4,000rpm and then you just fly.
The 4 wheel disc brake work wonderfully. Speaking of Volvo's safety and with the WHIPLASH seats that support your neck in a rear end collision, you can be 100% sure while you're driving.
Being 6'2&quot;, I found myself cramped up in any other seats except the driver. Having such a big and low glove compartment, I found less leg room for the passenger seat or I have to move the seat far back which will make it impossible for a person to sit in the back. Backseat I can't even sit correctly or my knees will be pushed against the front seats.
Overall this car is great but while you're adding options, you'd better keep the price in mind because it can shoot up pretty fast with all the options.<br><br>
