            I didn't do too much homework in selecting this particular model at the time I was looking to upgrade from my 2.1 megapixel camera to a 3 megapixel camera without having to pay the current prices. So I spent my time lurking around the ubid website and won the bid on this particular model. For those who don't mind getting yesteryear's technology with the model being refurbished this is a great website to buy from.

I had a few brands in mind and lets just say this was one of them I felt comfortable in purchasing. In spite of all the purported shortcomings with this model they can be easily cured.

First, most people have complained about the short battery life and its somewhat proprietary battery. I've solved this problem by buying a third party battery pack(maha) that allows me to shoot with the monitor on for easily 5+ hours and the battery was still strong. Second, issues with the small compact flash card provided. Well that is a standard practice and I've been able to use quite a few offbrand cards in the camera(simple technology, dan-elec, i-o-data) with no problems. Third, the problem with the on/off switch being easily tripped. My suggestion is to reverse the battery and this will prevent inadvertent powerups.

Now as to my observations on this model. Yes, this model is very compact which is great for those who might be travelers or those with small to average hands. But those with large hands might have trouble overgripping this model. The room between the grip and lens is pretty small now the lens does protrude so it would be hard to misplace a finger over the lens but the other hand might inadvertently cover the flash or viewfinder. This model comes with the capability for automatic mode and manual settings. I must say that if you are the type that does not enjoy reading manuals to find out about details don't get this camera it has an overly engineered menu and for some functions you have to be pushing down on two controls simultaneously(aperture, shutter-speed, iso setting).

With regards to the point-and-shoot capability the camera has some appealing features. The shutter button can be depressed partially to lock in a focus setting when the focus is not in the center of the frame. For a little more trouble one can switch to some ten specialized settings while in <b>scene</b> for optimized camera function to capture: portrait, indoor party, sunset, firework, etc. 

Now with regards to the more advanced settings I was a bit disappointed. First, the aperture setting only allows you to choose the outside ranges only. Setting the shutter, aperture, and iso required manipulation of two controls simultaneously which isn't conducive for rapid shooting. If you don't mind spending a couple of hours poring over the features than you probably will not mind the complexity.

My overall impression of this camera is favorable for the following reasons: its a compact model and the body is entirely plastic which makes for a very lightweight model. This comes in handy when one has extension lens on the camera. There are multiple settings besides the point-and-shoot mode allowing one to customize the aperture, shutter and iso sensitivity. One feature for those who like to know exact setting for every shot will enjoy the playback feature which lists all the photographic settings for each shot and this information can be downloaded to a text file. Besides the good selection of addon accessories for this model quite a few third party addons can be found. 

Comparing this model to more updated models in the nikon line(885) I didn't feel like i was losing that much. The zoom range is 3x versus 2.5x. Otherwise all the functionality seemed to be the same in both models.
