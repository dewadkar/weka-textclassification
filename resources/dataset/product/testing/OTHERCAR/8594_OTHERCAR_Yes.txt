            There were only 8,000 cars (approximately) of this model produced by Infiniti in 1991 &amp; 1992, which begs the question, &quot;why did they stop making them?&quot;  These are great little cars.  I test drove the car my husband bought and liked it so much, I had to find one of my own.  I ended up having mine shipped from Long Island all the way to Arizona and it was worth it.

They are fairly zippy with a V6 engine and they handle the road quite nicely.  They don't feel as tight or heavy as a BMW or Mercedes, but they don't carry the price tags of those cars either.  What they do offer that goes head to head with the best of them is the simplicity of taking the top up and down.  Everything is automatic.  With one button, the front panel unscrews, all the windows retract and the roof lowers into place.  The same is true for raising it back up, no levers to snap and no need to reach over into the passenger seat if you're alone.

I also love my M30 because in a world filled with &quot;bubble&quot; cars, the sharp lines of the Infiniti stand out.  I know that I'm not alone in this belief because there are at least a half dozen M30 convertibles in my Bay Area town, all of them in great condition (on the outside at least).  The gas mileage could be a little better, but I suppose Japanese cars are no longer synonymous with energy efficient.  <br>
