            I am a college student at Texas A&amp;M.  My parents wanted a reliable vehicle for me to go off to college in and boy did i get one!!! They bouhgt me a 1998 Dodge Ram extended cab and I love it.  Since I have owned my Dodge I have added an awesome spryin bed liner and stylish black grill guard.  My turck has the perfect combination of luxury with all the loaded features I could ever want.  The factor Infinity sound system is great too.  Besides luxury, it provides that since of power and comfort when driving because I know I am driving an awesome truck.  I guess you could say that it gives a feeling that &quot;if i can't dodge something, I would have no problem ramming it.&quot;  My experiance with this truck has made me a Dodge man for LIFE!!<br><br>
