            We have the 3/4 ton Suburban and tow a thirty foot travel trailer with it.  This Sport Utility Vehicle is a real work horse and towing a camper never slows it down for even a second.  Great ride, comfortable interior, not to mention room for the kids and the dog plus a whole lot more!  The only two negative things about this Sprt Utility Vehicle are the placement of the cup holder (bumps in the road cause drinks to spill) and the gas mileage (but who buys a Sport Utility Vehicle for the great gas mileage?).  We highly recommend the Suburban!  This is our second Suburban and we plan to always have a Suburban in our garage.<br><br>
