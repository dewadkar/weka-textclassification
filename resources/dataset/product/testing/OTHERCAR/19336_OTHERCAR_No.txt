            I purchased my 1998 Land Rover Discovery in May 2001 when it had around 24,000 miles on it. At the time of writing this review (December 2002), I've had the vehicle for one year and eight months. It now has around 50,000 miles on it. 

Having owned the Discovery for nearly two years, I feel qualified, from a consumer's standpoint, to state that the only reason Land Rover is hailed (by it's internal marketing staff) as the "Most Traveled Vehicle on Earth," is because the Land Rover--a British make--was for many years the only vehicle available in many of the former colonies of the British Commonwealth (thus accounting for its ubiquitous appearance in the Australian Outback, and many desert scenes throughout Africa).

After taking delivery in May 2001, I attempted to input the factory code that enables the operation of the stereo. I input the stereo code incorrectly and, after a number of failed attempts, took the unit to the Land Rover dealership on Old Katy Road in Houston. The servicemen were unable to make the stereo work: after I attempted to input the code 3 times without success, the stereo reset itself. So, we had to order a new unit from the Land Rover factory. They ultimately got the new stereo to work.

Around 27,000 miles, I discovered that the vehicle had 4 hoses leaking, some worse than others. one of the hoses is the hose transmitting the power steering fluid to the steering column.

Then the real problems began. At approximately 30,000 miles, the brakes--all four of them--essentially disintegrated. I purchased a new set of brake pads and rotors and had them installed for the reasonable sum of $1,300.00.

One day around 36,000 miles, I walked out of my office to go home on a Friday afternoon, got in my truck, and  inserted the key into the ignition. When I attempted to turn the key to start the engine, the key wouldn't turn. I called Land Rover's service department to explain the problem. The technician knew immediately what the problem was--it is a regular occurrence according to him. He informed me that it sounded like the ignition switch was broken and would need to be replaced...but it could simply be that I had a bent key. Whatever the case, I had to pay a tow truck driver to tow the vehicle to Land Rover. Here's where the fun really began. Land Rover identified about 5 other problems with the car and later telephoned to ask me if they could keep it "overnight" to figure out the problem. "Sure," I said, but "you do not have authorization to spend a single dime unless you get my written consent first." Seven days later, Land Rover called me to explain that, golly gee, it was just a bent key that was causing problems with the ignition switch. So, I went to pick up my truck. Land Rover presented me with a bill for $253.00 for taking care of various items like replacing a fuse, cleaning off the engine, and other useless crap. I told the service rep I wasn't paying them a dime. After receiving from me a lesson in customer service and common sense, they eventually relented. I did, however, agree to pay for correcting the problem--the price of a new key. Although you and I can go to Wal-Mart or the local hardware store and have a key cut for $2.00 - $4.00, Land Rover's keys are so special that they cost $25.00. "Who cares," I thought, "I just want my damn truck back that you've had for a week." Undoubtedly, the response they were counting on. Happy to get out of there with paying $25.00, I walked outside to start my truck and go home. Guess what? The ignition still didn't work, even with the magical new key. These incompetents had spent an entire week working on the vehicle and still couldn't diagnose the problem (at one point the sales guy let it slip that they were training some new mechanics on my vehicle). Since it wasn't the key, it must have been the ignition switch. After paying $700.00 to replace that, I was finally able to drive it again.  And not yet even 40,000 miles on the car.

Then--and this is my favorite--I once again walked out of my office to go home for the weekend and got into the Discovery. I cranked the engine, put my foot on the brake (as required before shifting into gear), and attempted to shift from "park" to "reverse."  The transmission would have nothing of it. After several minutes of trying to fix the problem myself, I called Land Rover's service techs. Again, they had an immediate answer--clearly this new problem was another common occurrence. The Land Rover tech explained to me that the reason my Discovery wouldn't shift into gear is because the "brake clip" was broken.  HUH?  After interrogating the tech some more, I figured it out. You see, when the "brake clip" is not broken, the brake lights work and it is, therefore, safe for you to drive. If, however, the brake clip is broken, the brake lights do not work, and it is unsafe for you to drive. So, rather than allow you to decide how to fix your brake lights, Land Rover simply disables the vehicle for you, undoubtedly in the unselfish interest of protecting you and your loved ones...or maybe so they can make an extra buck. I again had to have the truck towed, but having been lied to and the subject of blatantly fraudulent charges by the Land Rover techs last time, I took the thing to another outfit (who, by the way, seems to be much more honest and fair dealing than Land Rover). Unfortunately, they were not much less expensive.  But that's because of the unnecessarily expensive Land Rover parts that don't last 1/6th as long as their equivalent parts on any American, German, or Japanese vehicle I've owned. Another $1,200 down the tubes to fix the brake clip and diagnose and fix another mystical problem with the engine that refused to allow the "check engine" light to turn off, and not yet at 50,000 miles.  

I am desperate for a buyer for my vehicle. If you know where I can find one, let me know.
