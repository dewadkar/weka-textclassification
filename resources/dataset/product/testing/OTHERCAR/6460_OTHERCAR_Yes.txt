            I have been driving my '95 Toyota Camry LE for about a year, and overall, I am fairly pleased with its performance.  Although I think it lacks in the looks department, and has a few inconveniences and problems, it is still a great buy.

I think the best part of this car is the smooth ride, and soft feel that it gives you.  It is the feeling of driving a luxury car, but you get it with the Toyota price.  I have considered selling this for a more sporty car a few times, buy have decided against it because I know whatever I buy will not compare to the Camry in smoothness, and I won't like it as much.

This car has had a very good repaire record also.  I have only had to take it into the shop a few times, and the problems were always fixed inexpensively.

There are a few problems I have found with this car though.  The first is that their is a weird crunching sound that comes from the breaks when you break hard.  The guy at the Toyota shop said that it was normal, and that my car has metal breaks and they will do that, but I highly doubt that all Camrys will make the crunching noise.  Personally, I think that this is only my car.  There were a few other problems I've had, like bad suspenssion, and little things like winsheild wipers and stuff, but overall this is a great car.
