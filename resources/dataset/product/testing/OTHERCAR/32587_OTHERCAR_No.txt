            There have been times with this car that I've wondered if I were supposed to lift the floor mats and Flinstone it.  I've never owned a car that I've hated more and before this I owned a <i>Geo Metro</i>.

One of the other reviews mentioned a problem with brakes locking up and I must agree thoroughly with that one.  My brakes tend to lock up for no apparent reason causing quite an adventure in sliding around the road.  I have been lucky enough not to kill anyone yet though.

The seats in this thing are awful as well.  They're okay for about a half hour, then all the circulation in your butt is cut off and you feel compelled to rub it vigorously upon arrival at your destination.  This doesn't always make the impression that you wanted.

And as far as service, the Saturn dealerships leave a lot to be desired.  There are never any donuts or good magazines in the waiting room like the commercials would like you to believe.  You normally get stuck sitting next to some weirdo who insists on trying to convert you to her religion.  Not only that, it takes forever to get in and I'm usually treated like <i>I'm</i> responsible for whatever is wrong with this pile of poop.

I guess if you can't afford a real car and you enjoy sitting in waiting rooms during service, this is a great car.  Otherwise, spend a little extra and get a nice import.<br><br>
