            This is my 3rd digital camera. After having had some low-quality products (Mustek, Samsung) I wanted to have a camera with a resolution good enough to print full-page pictures. Panasonic's PV-DC3000E was one of the cheapest with all the features I wanted to have (incl. zoom), so I gave it a try.
To begin with the positive:
#1: the picture quality is really good. I like the colors and sharpness of the produced images (mostly outdoor)
#2: The zoom works well, although newer cameras have the digital zoom better integrated - you don't have to switch modes to switch from standard to digital zoom.
However, I found three things I don't like about this camera:
#1 and this really bothers me: time-lag. The time is takes from the button being pressed until the picture is actually taken is well above 1 second. If you want to photograph things in motion, forget it.
#2: size. I know, the Panasonic is not the latest camera, but I must admit I envy the sleek design of the newer arrivals, which often are smaller than your cellphone, including a 3xoptical zoom!
#3: Batteries. I bought myself 2 sets of rechargable batteries which is ok, however, in my next camera I would prefer not to hassle around with standard cells.
