            70,000 miles in 2 years in my Audi A4 TDi 110 have proved to be as enjoyable as they have been economical. The car was bought as much for its low running and contract hire costs as the Audi image that comes with it.

It is comfortable, quick and feels every bit as solid as when it was brand new. The fuel economy is exceptional even at high speed. Over 50 mpg is easily attainable and 90mph cruising drops consumption to the high 40's. 

Minor electrical problems with the heated mirrors were fixed under the 60,000 mile warranty as was a broken catalytic converter ( the car tends to sink low if it goes over a kerb and the underneath has grounded out a couple of times going over kerbs ).

Servicing is on the expensive side once the mileage gets beyond 50,000 but the dealer is friendly and always professional.

The A4 provides a better quality alternative to volume manufacturer alternatives at the same or slightly lower cost per mile<br><br>
