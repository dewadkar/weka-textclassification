            I got this camera for Christmas '01, but was hesitant about getting into the world of digital cameras.  I looked at returning it ($399 at Ritz Camera), but eventually decided to keep it.  So far, it has been a really wise decision. 

The camera comes with a 16 MB smart card.  That is a great format to store data on, but that card is clearly too small.  Go to Pricewatch.com and buy yourself a 128 MB card for around $60 (or less).  I have a 64 MB card that I have not filled yet.  My biggest pro on this camera is the fact that the picture quality is incredible.  Auto-focus generally does a very good job, but you can also adjust the settings manually, just as you would a normal higher-end SLR camera (single lens reflex).  Picture viewing is easy on the well-lit LCD screen.  The screen is dark in low lighting, so it can be difficult to know if your subject is in frame, but the flash is terrific and the darkest room shows up great in the photo.  (a couple of secs after photo is taken, the image is flashed on the viewscreen, so you do not have to 'switch' over to View mode in order to see what you took)

Data transfer to computer is very quick via USB.  You can also use the camera as a webcam, although I have not, yet.  I have taken a few short movies (mp3 audio is good---but low lighting situations=poor resolution on movie).  Nice feature to have, but if you really want to take movies, get a camcorder.  

Zoom is 6X optical, 3X digital.  After taking a photo, you can switch to view mode, and zoom into the picture, to make sure everything is in focus.  If not, just take another pic! all it costs you is some battery juice.  

The AA Batteries don't last very long--probably about as long as 60 pictures.  I recommend buying 2 sets of rechargeable batts so you have some on hand.  Plus, if you do run out of juice, it's not hard to find 4 AAs.  ($24 for AA/AAA chrgr with 4 AAs at RadioShack, $14 for 4AAs at BestBuy)

The included software is useful for managing your pictures (rotating, cropping, displaying in slide show format), and it also has a lightweight Adobe product.  In no way does this compare to Adobe's flagship PhotoShop program (which I also have), so if you want to do some real photo editing, it would recommend it.

UPDATE 12/02:
I was in love with my little camera, with the main exceptions being its fairly bulky/boxy size and the difficulty in using the Electronic View Finder in low light settings (mostly, this was a problem for friends or strangers using my camera to take pictures, as I adapted to using my 'other eye' to line up the shot when in low light).  That is, until, the lens malfunctioned.  I had the camera out taking shots of a sea turtle nesting one night--when I started out, the camera was fine, but at the end of the evening, the lens was no longer retracting well, and it was 'loose' in its housing.  With a lot of effort, I was able to hold the lens in place and get the picture in 'focus' on the view finder.  There was no trauma to the camera--I didn't drop it, get sand in it, etc.  I was just walking with it in my hand, just like I had been using it for the previous 9 months, and Bam! all of a sudden it didn't work well.  Unfortunately, that malfunction occured at the beginning of a vacation to Costa Rica, and on day 6 of my vacation, and I had the camera pickpocketed from me in a busy plaza!  I had been intending to return the camera to Fuji when I got back to the States, as I assumed it was still under warranty.  The thieves got my 64MB SMC with all my pictures on it, too, so I lost those memories.  
Bad luck, I thought, with my camera's lens.  Probably an isolated incident.  But then, I was discussing my tale wih my sister in late November, and she had the SAME PROBLEM with her lens (my parents gave us the cameras at the same time).  I have to think that since they were bought together, they came from the same 'batch' from Fuji.  She didn't have her camera stolen, and is going to try and return it to Fuji this month before the 1 yr purchase date arrives.
