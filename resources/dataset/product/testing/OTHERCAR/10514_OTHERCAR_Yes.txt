            I recently purchased a year 2000 3.2TL with GPS Navigational System.  I had been told by others that it was extremely difficult to find a TL, as demand was so high, but we got lucky this time.  First let me start off by saying that my wife and I were considering the BMW 323 and the 3.2TL.  While the BMW is more sporty, and may even drive better in terms of pure performance, the 3.2TL possesses a refined luxury that the BMW lacked.  We liked the overall feel of the TL more.  You can feel the difference, just sitting in the car.  The BMW is more of a sports car, while the Acura reminded me of the luxury of a higher-end Lexus.  The Acura also has much more leg room in the back, which was important to us.
Anyhow, we walked into the dealership this past September and found out that 2000 production had just started.  They had a White Diamond Perl colored car with GPS already on order which nobody had yet expressed a desire to buy.  That was exactly what we wanted, we got lucky I guess.  Incidentally, I would HIGHLY recommend the dealership we dealt with, and even more so the salesperson.  I have never met a car salesperson I didn't despise until I met Tony Lu of Sunnyvale Acura.  He is the one and only car salesperson I have yet to find whom I can truly respect.  
Anyhow, back to the car... The pickup is great, the power is excellent, and the ride is smooth.  The interior has all the feel of a luxury vehicle including heated seats and leather.  All options except GPS and a 6-disc changer are standard.  
I would highly recommend the GPS Navigational System.  Originally I worried we may not get good use out of it, but it is turning out to be an excellent investment.  Already in the past few months, it has brought me untold value in downtown San Francisco, and when sightseeing around Northern California.  It also never ceases to amaze me in that I can literally ask it to take me to the closest Chinese restaurant, and it gladly complies with immediate directions.  The 2000 model GPS unit also features a DVD-ROM with map coverage of the entire continental United States.  This is quite an improvement over the 99 version which contained only 1 of 9 regions in the US.  Overall, the Nav system may be pricey at an extra $2000, but I think that it is definitely worth it.  I have yet to find an example of where it has directed me wrong.  Be forewarned however though that even though they say the entire US is included, only certain areas of the US (large metropolitan areas mostly) include detailed maps.  Certain states such as many in the mid-west have extremely limited coverage in the map database.  Check with your dealership regarding your location.  For California however, the coverage is excellent.
What don't I like about the car?  The passenger side seat heater doesn't extend to the back of the seat like it does on the driver's side.  Talk about a lousy way to save a few bucks in the factory.  Also, be forewarned.  If your passenger has a small build, like my wife, the side-air bag light will intermittently go on and off as the vehicle determines that the passenger may be hurt by the side airbag.  When the light goes on, this means the side airbag is temporarily being disabled.  Depending on how she shifts her weight in the seat, this light goes on and off which can be annoying and distracting to the driver.  Finally, I dislike that the moonroof doesn't close automatically when you turn off the vehicle.  Clearly all of these are minor quirks.
Overall, this vehicle is excellent.  I unfortunately had to pay MSRP, but got the floor mats and wheel locks thrown in for free.  The dealership and salesperson made the experience a breeze (that was a first for me in car buying, let me tell you... last time when I bought a Toyota, I felt like I was selling my soul).  The 3.2TL is a great intro-level luxury car that feels like a Lexus and has the pick-up and power of a BMW.  I would highly recommend it.  Feel free to email me if you have any questions for a satisfied owner. :)<br><br>
