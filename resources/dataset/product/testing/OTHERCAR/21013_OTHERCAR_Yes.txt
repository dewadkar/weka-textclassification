            The '99 RAV4 is a smaller and sporty SUV. I bought it for the extra room, its look, and the 4wheel drive capability. I also like the fact that the seats fold down and then flip up against the front seats.I did not like the fact that it is only a 4 cylinder engine. The ride is smooth and takes bumpy road pretty well. This SUV is also a lot less money then most of the other SUVs on the market. My last car was a Toyota and they are reliable cars and that was also a big factor on my buying a RAV4. 
     
   One major reason to pass up buying a RAV4 in my eyes would be if you are taller than 6 feet tall, this SUV is not for you...The RAV4 is roomier than say the Corolla ,but there is not a whole lot of leg room for someone that tall. I am 5'10&quot; and i am comfortable in the RAV ,but my boyfriend who is 6'3&quot; is not.
   Other reasons to buy the RAV4 it is reasonably priced.Toyota makes great cars that last. One can get around easily in the snow. Woman can get in and out of the RAV4 in a dress/skirt with no problems. The RAV4 does get very good gas mileage as well.And last but definitely not least it is a great looking vehicle!
