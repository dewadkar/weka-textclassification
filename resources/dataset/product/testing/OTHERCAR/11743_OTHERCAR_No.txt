            IN AUGUST 1999 MY 1993 PONTIAC TRANSPORT MINIVAN WITH 148,000 KILOMETERS ON IT WAS STARTING TO SHOW WEAR AND I WENT TO MY LOCAL DODGE DEALER AND FELL IN LOVE WITH AN IMMACULATE CONDITION 1996 DODGE CARAVAN SE.  IT ONLY HAD 30,000 KILOMETERS ON IT AND IT WAS LOADED, EXCEPT FOR LEATHER.  IT HAD BEEN DRIVEN NY A LITTLE OLD LADY AND ONLY HER!  IT WAS LITERALLY BRAND NEW.  SHE HAD EVERY SERVICE DONE AT THE DEALERSHIP AND THE RECORDS TO BACK IT UP.  THE ENGINE PURRED LIKE A KITTEN, THE AIR CONDITIONING WAS ICE COLD AND THE RESPONSE FORM THE GAS PEDAL AND BRAKE WAS SUPERB.  IN THE SUMMER OF 2000 ALL HECK BROKE OUT.  I WOULD TURN THE KEY AND THE ACCESSORIES WOULD COME ON BUT THE VAN WOULD NOT START..I HAD IT TESTED, THE STARTER TESTED AND EVERYTHING POSSIBLE...IT KEPT COMING BACK CLEAR..AND THE MECHANICS HAVE NO IDEA..NONE!!  IT IS A VERY ANNOYING PROBLEM BECAUSE I CANT USE THE REMOTE STARTER IN THE -15'F TEMPERATURE IN WINTER AND FORGET ABOUT COOLING IN SUMMER, THE AIR CONDITIONING IS PATHETIC NOW IT SIMPLY EMITS A COOL BREEZE, IT ALSO DRIVES MY ENGINE TEMPERATURE UP, AND THIS SUMMER I ALMOST OVERHEATED.  RIGHT NOW I STILL OWN IT BUT AM LOOKING TO TRADE IT IN BECAUSE IT NOE HAS 77 000 KILOMETERS ON IT AND I AM SICK OF THE DARN THING NOT STARTING IN WINTER!!  IT HANDLES LIKE A SHOPPING CART THE BRAKE SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE, IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF THE AIR BAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT!!  AND WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL IT DOES NOT KEEP ITS SPEED ON AN INCLINE.  I HAVE HAD THE ENGINE TUNED UP WITH THE VERY BEST FILTERS, FLUIDS AND NOT TO MENTION PLATINUM SPARK PLUGS THAT THEY PUT ON MERCEDES BENZ...NOTHING HELPED.  AND NOW I AM NOTICING THE EXTREME LACK OF POWER TO PASS, SO WHEN I HAVE TO PASS ON THE HIGHWAY I MUST GUN THE ENGINE AND IT SCREAMS LIKE A JUMBO JET TRYING TO TAKE OFF WITH TOO MANY PEOPLE.  NOT TO MENTION THE CHEAP INFERIOR GRADE..WELL..EVERYTHING ON THIS VAN!  THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT FLEW OPEN ON MY MOTHERS KNEE WHILE SHE LOOKED FOR GAS STATION COUPONS, THEY USED THESE TINY LITTLE PLASTIC 'THINGS' TO HOLD UP THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT - STUPID - WHAT ELSE....??  OH YES..THE CONSTANT SMELL OF GASOLINE IS  ANNOYING, THE SLIPS IN GEARS IS DARN RIGHT ANNOYING AND MY 1987 MERCEDES BENZ WITH A 6.9L V-8 GETS BETTER GAS MILEAGE THEN THE 3.0L CARAVAN ENGINE?  CONFUSING? IT CONFUSED ME THAT'S FOR DARN SURE!  CONCLUDING IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT ANY DODGE VEHICLE ON THE MARKET, KEEP GOING, DODGE SHOULD BE PAYING US TO DRIVE THEIR JUNK AROUND!
