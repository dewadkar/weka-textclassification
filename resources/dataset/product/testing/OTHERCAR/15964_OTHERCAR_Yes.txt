            I recently traded my C class in for an E300TD.  I wanted more trunkspace and more rear legroom, plus with the prices of premium fuel, the diesel was attractive.  I got more than I bargained for:

The power of the turbo, once it kicks in, is enough to put the driver in the back seat.  This car outperformed my gasoline-powered C class in every way!  The steering at first seemed a little mushy but then I realized, the car actually anticipates the drivers' needs and assists more or less based upon the speed.  Likewise for the windshield wiper and stereo - speed compensating controls!

My parents have been driving Mercedes-Benz products for the past 20 years and this is my second Benz.  The E300 TurboDiesel outperforms, in my opinion, every car they or I have ever owned.  (14 different cars in all from S to SL)

I recommend this car to anyone who drives from the 3-state-covering salesmen like me to the carpool-driving mom.<br><br>
