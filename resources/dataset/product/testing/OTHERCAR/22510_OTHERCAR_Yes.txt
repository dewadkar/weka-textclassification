            I began shopping for a small SUV that I could tow behind my motorhome.  For obvious reasons I needed something fairly light. I initially began looking at the Toyota Rav4, but quickly learned that it could not be towed with all four wheels down, without modifications.  The same held true for the new Ford Escape. A friend of mine who also owns a motorhome told me about the XL-7.  I had never considered buying a Suzuki, especially after all of the problems associated with the defunked Samurai.  I went on-line and took the virtual tour and had to admit that the XL-7 looked impressive.  A test drive made an even greater impression.  The ride is actually quite smooth for a vehicle of itï¿½s size and type, and while the V6 is not a powerhouse, it performs just fine.  The icing on the cake is the fact that the 4X4 model can be towed with all four wheels down, with the transfer case placed in neutral.  No modifications required.  I waited for the right price and financing on the color that I wanted (pearl white), and made my purchase.

While the XL-7 has not been 100% trouble free so far, but it has by no means been troublesome.  My only disappointment has been with the quality of the interior.  The seats are a little too firm, but provide very good back support for those of us with bad backs. The rear A/C works fairly well at keeping all passengers cool. The dash seemed a little plain, so I ordered and installed an optional woodgrain kit sold by Suzuki, at a cost of $180. The stereo system (even the premium system) is not very good, and there is a slight window wind noise when traveling on  freeways.  Outside of that, the engine is very quiet, and handling is in my opinion quite good. I am averaging 19-20 MPG, which is expected.

I would recommend the XL-7 to anyone looking for a lightweight dinghy for their RV, or anyone looking for a low priced seven passenger SUV.
