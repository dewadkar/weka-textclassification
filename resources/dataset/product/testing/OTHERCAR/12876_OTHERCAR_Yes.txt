            I bought my 1993 J30 because I fell in love with it and it was the best deal around. Why these cars have depreciated so much, I don't know. But my research has shown me they are reliable. My test drives showed me it was the most enjoyable car I have ever driven--and that says a lot considering I used to sell Mercedes-Benz for a living.

I love everything about the J30: the sound system, the styling, the seats, the suspension--everything! Perfect harmony. The transmission is smooth, the engine is quiet, plus there is no wind noise at 60 miles per hour. The ABS, the dual airbags, and the crush proof roof are great safety features.

My commute from work is 37 miles of rush hour traffic. I arrived home tonight in a state of bliss. With a CD sound system this good playing John Coltrane, and an automobile this comfortable, could there be any other outcome?

I guess I would sum it up with a quote from Jim Mateja from the Chicago Tribune: &quot;If it rides like a Jaguar, handles like a Jaguar and looks like a Jaguar-and it works--then it must be an Infiniti J30 sedan.&quot;

I'm going to buy another one for my wife.
