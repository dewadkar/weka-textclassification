            When I bought my 1998 Nissan Sentra GXE March of 1999, I was really pressed for a vehicle.  I still wanted to be somewhat picky about my purchase considering I had a long drive to work, and I knew I didn't want the trouble of a used car being in the shop.  I bought my Sentra with 30,000 miles on it.  When you consider that these cars have a reputation for going the distance, this was nothing.  I had several friends with Sentras and all of them agreed, this was a proud purchase.  So I jumped on the opportunity with both feet.  I have in the past year doubled the mileage on this car with NO problems.  I wanted a comfortable ride for my 40 mile drive back and forth to work every day and that is what I got.  Plus I have all the luxuries of cruise control, power mirrors, and power widows.  OH not to mention, power locks with the child locks on the back doors.  This was a wonderful little package.  I strongly recommend this product for anyone.  This makes a perfect car for first time drivers to parents to seniors.  I get excellent gas mileage and that is very important with these gas prices.  Buy it! Save on buying the new car because as soon as it is driven off the lot it loses value.  Buying my car a few years old saved me money and it will still last miles and miles.<br><br>
