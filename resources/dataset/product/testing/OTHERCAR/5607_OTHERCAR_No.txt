            We bought our Mazda Protege in 1997.  We had some brake problems right off the start.  We also seemed to have some transmission problems too.  When slowing down, but not stopping the car would be fine.  It was when we would try and accelerate after slowing down that the transmission was real &quot;jerky&quot;.  We had it checked over and over at the dealer where we bought it and were told that it was normal.  

Another thing was a light squeak when you depressed the brake peddle.  Our Mazda dealer in Austin has yet to fix the problem.  

Our air-conditioning system is also starting to blow warmer air than it used to.  I understand that the summers in Austin are brutal so I try and take that into consideration as well.

It's hard to give this car a definitive review one way or the other.  I think that the majority of the Protege's are good cars and we just got one with a few quirks in it.  I would recommend this to someone who has to get into a small car and could get one for a really good deal.  Otherwise, I would probably go with a Honda or Toyota for my next car.<br><br>
