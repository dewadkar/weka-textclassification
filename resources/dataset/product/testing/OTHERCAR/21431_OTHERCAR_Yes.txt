            Without question, the purchase of my 2001 Elantra GT two days ago from Keyes Hyundai in Van Nuys, California, was the most pleasant and straightforward dealership experience I�ve ever had (and this is car number six!).  In the past, with other dealerships, I�ve been insulted, belittled, and defrauded.  I�ve even had to pursue legal action (I won, of course).  

But my first time with Hyundai was truly trouble-free.  And I�m a former Infiniti owner, so I have high service standards.  My salesperson was direct and easygoing; he never gave me the �hard sell.�  We consumers are tired of the hard sell...The night before I bought my car, I researched every detail of the purchase carefully.  Weirdly, Edmunds listed the GT as having a retail value of 11,900 but Kelley listed it as 14,400.  So I paid 13,000.00 for a GT with 12,400 miles on it.  I think it was a fair price. And of course, I'm covered bumper to bumper until 2006!

One thing about the GT's:  they are not that easy to find!!  I wanted the moonroof/abs/tc/automatic model, and I had to go to four dealerships before I found it in dark red.  It's not really burgundy.  I recommend checking out this color in person - don't go by the "burgundy" description, or by pix on the web.

Initially, I wasn't sure about the dark red color, but then I saw it in the sunlight - it is a PERFECTLY TONED color - just enough sparkle, but rich enough to look "serious."  I'm already getting lots of looks.  And the interior controls are a dream - easy, clean, simple lines.  I am thrilled with my purchase.  My automatic is downright peppy!  Handling is quick and responsive, and the purple dash lights lend an opulent quality to the car.  Having owned an Infiniti Q45, I was not just surprised, but SHOCKED at the features of this gorgeous little hatchback.

Let's see what I have to say after I put some more miles on it, but as of right now, I can honestly say I've never been happier with an auto purchase.
