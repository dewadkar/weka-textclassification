            The STS combines the best features from the top luxury imports to make one outstanding automobile. It has the handling of a BMW, the elegance of a Jaguar, the safety of a Mercedes and the electronic sophistication of a Lexus. It takes the best features from the top imports while adding some of its own wizardy, such as On-Star, Info Center, Night Vision and continuously self adjusting seats. The ride is quiet and smooth, the engine powerful and the cabin appointments are unmatched anywhere at any price. You have to sit in the seats and just listen to the incredible Bose sound system! The quality and craftsmanship are first rate throughout this car.

Over the years I've owned BMW's, Jaguars, Volvos and the best Japanese luxury cars and I can say without reservation that the STS is the best of all of them.
