            I bought my first car two weeks after I finished graduate school.  I had literally been trying to save for a down payment for years.  I had always relied upon carpooling with my mother or friends to get places.  I also had my heart set on a Honda.  Yes, that's right, a Honda Civic Coupe.  Not knowing much about buying a car, I went to the Honda dealership with my parents to check out what they had to offer.  This was the dealership where my parents bought both of their Hondas.  I expected to be treated well.  NOT!!  I was told there was no way I could get a car loan without my father as a co-signer.  The salesman never even asked me anything about myself or my credit.  I decided, based on this jerk's attitude, that I would not be buying a Honda.  So on the way home, we stopped at the local Saturn dealer.  

Since that day, I have been a loyal Saturn owner.  The salespeople there were incredibly polite and respectful.  They answered all of my questions and described their cars in great detail.  I liked the idea of not having to haggle over cost.  The prices on the sticker were exactly the cost of the car.  I was able to have a custom sunroof installed by a local company--the dealer took care of this for me and had it done overnight.  I was impressed with the knowledge of the salespeople and their helpfulness.

I have had my car now for six years.  I have had very minor problems with it; needed a new battery after five and a half years, new brakes, two new tires.  Other than that, it's been routine maintenance like oil changes.  I still take my car to the dealer for maintenance, as I trust them to be honest with me about needed repairs.  I have found their prices to be comparable to local garages and chain places, like Pep Boys.  I am always able to get an appointment and wait--usually like an hour--for my car to be serviced.  I have even been able to drive in for service when my battery was on the fritz without an appointment.  

There are very few things I don't like about my car, the '94 SL1.  There are no rain guards on the door, so if it's pouring, I tend to get wet getting in.  I believe this was changed on newer models.  I cannot put the heat and the front window defroster on at the same time.  This is a little annoyance, but with the cold weather I like to have my feet warm while I can see out of the windshield!  In professional reviews of my car, I have read complaints about the noise of the Saturn engines.  I don't find this particularly problematic, although I could see how it could be a problem for people who do a lot of highway driving and want to hold conversations with others in the car.  I normally drive alone with the radio cranked up, so I tend not to notice the noise.

I would recommend the Saturn Company to everyone who is looking for a reasonably priced mid-size to compact car.  It is a great car for single people as well as families.  I trust the Saturn name to provide a reliable car and would buy another one when it's time to replace my current one.<br><br>
