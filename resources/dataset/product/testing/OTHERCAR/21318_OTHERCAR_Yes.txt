            My parents bought a 1988 Camry in October of 1987 after their car had been totaled in a car accident.  My sister and I both learned to drive a standard transmission on this car.  It was our main trip taking vehicle and traveled all over the United States.  The car had few trips to the service center other than regular maintenance.  After 11 years and 180,000 miles the windshield cracked for no apparent reason.  Basically, the heat on the inside of the car was on high because outside the temperature was below freezing.  We hit a bump and the windshield cracked.  I don't know if this is normal or not, but insurance covered the replacement, so it was no big deal.  Also, after 180,000 miles, the clutch went out.  So did the fuse that allows radio panel lighting and controls the heat and air conditioning.  The repair is a little expensive, and since the vehicle is obviously at the end of its days, my parents are just waiting until it can go no longer and will buy a new car.  Probably another Camry or maybe a Volkswagon Passat.  (Their Volkswagon had been totaled, so they have high opinions of Volkswagons.)

When my husband and I needed a new car for family needs, we considered the Toyota Camry as our first choice.  We also considered the Honda Accord and the Oldsmobile Alero.  The Alero was small for our needs and the larger Oldsmobile was out of our price range.  We test drove a couple different Camrys and one Accord.  After some haggling, we purchased a new 1999 Camry LE in August 1999.

So far we've had no problems with this car.  Granted, we've owned it less than a year.  However, we've put on already over 10,000 miles.  We expect this car to last us over 10 years and many more miles.  What do I like best about this car?  It is quite roomy and comfortable.  The front seat is comfortable for the 9 hour drive to my in-laws.  I can sit in the back seat, next to my daughter's car seat quite comfortably as well.  My husband does not feel cramped in the back seat with the car seat either.  The gas mileage is ok, but not as good as our Saturn SC2 had.  The ride is smooth and pretty quiet.

This is a good car for small families and people wanting established reliability.  There are many options out there similar to the Camry.  We preferred the Camry, but you really must test drive and research every option before buying.<br><br>
