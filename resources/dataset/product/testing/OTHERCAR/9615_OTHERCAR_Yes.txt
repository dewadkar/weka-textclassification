            I am a celica owner of the second generation and I have noticed that they are one of the most comfortable cars I have ever driven. The suspension on my ST model is very soft and comfortable, but the downside is that when I take sharp turns, the front end of the car dips downward and nearly towches the grownd. My car has 121,000 miles on it and when idling the engine is barely noticeable. I have tried to start the car while it was running by mistake many times. The Celica has got to be the most reliable car I have ever had. I reccomend the 5 speed manual transmission on the ST model because the power is a little low on the automatic transmission. Also, I have noticed that the Celica has a very comfortable ride also attributed to its bucket seats. Overall I would rate the Celica as the most reliable car under 30 grand.<br><br>
