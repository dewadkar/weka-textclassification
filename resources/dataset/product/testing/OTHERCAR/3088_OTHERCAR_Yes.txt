            In my opinion, this automobile is by far an outstanding ride. It's sporty, classy and comfortable. I now own a 98 Regal Custom. I've also owned a 91 Regal Custom. Both have been the best vehicles I have ever owned. They're versatile autos and provide all the spunk of a sports car, with the power and style of a luxury car. They make a great family car for long distance journeys or short trips to the store. Buick has been a name people can trust for many years and has always made a safe, durable and reliable car. The Regal is right up there carrying out that Buick tradition. I'll own a Regal as long as Buick continues making the kind of quality I demand in an automobile.<br><br>
