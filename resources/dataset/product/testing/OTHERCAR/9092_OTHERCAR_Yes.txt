            I purchased my 1999 Kia sportage used (3000) for a large discount that from the dealers. I LOVE MY KIA and am looking forward to my next one.  This car can take me anywhere and has room and lots of pep. It drives and handles very well.  

This car is great for the money and for a beginner who wants to use 4 wheel drive and go off roading. The only negitive that I have found is that I don't like the way the back hatch opens and closes. but for the rest of this car- i can handle it. I had the opportunity to take my Kia to the Snow, and it did just fine without snow tires or chains in the 4X4 mode. However if you are a beginner- have someone who is experienced with you your first time.
