            I recently traded a Pontiac Grand Prix GT that was out of warranty for a new 2003 Accord LX.  My wife has a Civic LX and we've always been thrilled with that car and have heard several glowing recommendations about Hondas from friends.  We did want to consider several options however, and after driving everything from a Honda Element to a Civic EX, to a Jetta in Turbo and Non-Turbo form - we finally drove an LX Accord and found just what we wanted. 

This car is my primary car and though Dallas is not always one huge traffic jam like LA can be, the traffic can be objectionable.  I like a stickshift vehicle, but I really wanted something that would be manageable enough with a clutch light enough to tolerate in traffic.  The 5-speed manual in the Accord is the perfect answer for me.  The shifter is very slightly notchy but with a nice short throw and the clutch is VERY light and easy to modulate.  The 4 cylinder with 160 HP from the i-Vtec technology just sings along with plenty of power with this transmission.  I believe most people would be more than satisfied with this amount of power, unless you are the type that really wants to haul(tush).  We are thrilled with how nicely this car drives with the manual transmission.  I did drive a 5 speed automatic version of the Accord LX with the 4 cylinder engine and found it much nicer and more refined than I would have thought.  Would I like a V6 with the automatic - yes - but given the difference in price I'd be more than happy with a 4 cylinder automatic if I'd wanted or needed an automatic transmission.  

The exterior and interior fit and finish are both very good.  I really love the styling of the car until one looks at the last 2 feet of the car.  The rear and lights look a little strange to me, but I do feel they've grown on me.  We've had the car a week.  I do wish I'd gotten the alloy wheels (just the style-conscious person in me I suppose), but our white car with tinted windows is nice looking in my opinion.  The front end looks very much like an S2000 in my opinion.  I think Honda made a good overall styling decision in designing the exterior of this car.

The interior is very elegantly appointed, given that our car is an LX and given the $ spent.  I really like the supportive seats.  I would like to have had a lumbar adjustment and split folding seats, but I'm nitpicking.  The cloth in our car is soft and looks to be made of quality materials.  I'm happy that the visors have extensions for blocking the sun (little things can make us happy at times).  I have enjoyed the new and very bright LED lit instrument panel and the stock CD stereo sounds great, considering it is a stock unit.  I miss my steering wheel radio controls, though this is an upgrade that some EX models have.  The sound tends to be a little muddy and boomy on the bass, but I find many stock systems to sound this way.  The new adjustable center armrest and console, as well as the (large) and ample cupholders (8 in this car) are wonderful.  I find the large covered cubbyhole in the center lower section of the dash to be very convenient for CD's as it was designed.  The center console has a pass through for a cell charging cord between the lower and upper sections as well as clips to keep the cord in place!  The lower section in the console has a power socket.  

I found the back seats to be reasonably spacious and the well made (unlike my Grand Prix) passthrough from the trunk is a nice touch in addition to the folding rear seat.  The ride from both the front and rear seats is well controlled but not "mushy" and the cabin is very quiet.  I'm surprised at times that I don't hear more engine noise.
The controls and ergonomics are great overall, though I did tend to confuse the AC/Heat controls with the main volume control dial for the radio at first.  This is no longer a problem now after a week.

The new key/remote has the entry controls built on a-la VW and others.  I find this convenient and living in TX, the ability to roll the windows down and vent out heat as you approach the car, using the remote is a great feature.  

I'd say that the small details make this car, considering the price.  I do miss a few things like an autodim mirror (upgrade), steering wheel radio controls (upgrade), and an inexpensive power seat option.  Overall - this is all just nitpicking as I'm very happy with this car so far considering the $ spent.  For us the Accord was a perfect and affordable solution that is actually fun to drive and practical as well.  

I highly recommend the whole Accord line.  All the Accord models drive well and a wide variety of trim lines and options are available to satisfy most needs.  For great all around transportation and a Car & Driver Top 10 - what more could most of us ask for.

I'll add more details on our experience with this car as time unfolds.
