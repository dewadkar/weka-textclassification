            Having read the first two negative Epinion reviews on the Acura SLX, I must disagree with most of the comments and the over-all word picture offered by these reviewers.  I am amazed at the apparent lack of knowledge and/or the unrealistic expectations of these and many other SUV owners.  

Hey people, wake up! you are driving trucks!  In case you weren't aware, the UV in SUV stands for UTILITY VEHICLE. They are big and heavy and were designed as special purpose vehicles.  4 wheel drive vehicles are designed for off-road use and therefore, they are designed for high clearance, with a high center of gravity and to be operated on narrow roads or trails.  These vehicles were not designed to zip through downtown traffic, or for long high-speed road trips down the interstate or to take the kids to their soccer game for that matter.  In fact, if you want to see the highest concentration of Isuzu Troopers, simply go to any mountain community where it snows (such as Tahoe).  Or take a trip to a 3rd world country where a good road would be considered unpassable by our standards.  You will see Isuzu Troopers everywhere.  And there's a good reason for that. They perform as the designers intended.

Unfortunately, too many people expect their SUV's to handle like their sports sedans, and they get nervous when they take a turn too fast and they don't understand why it feels like it's going to tip over. Or when the wind blows them around and they think the vehicle handles poorly. These are usually driver problems, not vehicle design faults. Never mind that many SUV owners refuse to accept the fact that by purchasing a 4 wheel drive vehicle, they have entered into a totally different class of vehicle and an entirely unique driving dimension.
 
I am currently on my 2nd Acura SLX.  Yes, the 1996 model was indeed under powered, primarily due to the fact that Acura added hundreds of pounds of extra weight to the vehicle as a result of the &quot;luxury&quot; accoutrements, sound proofing etc.  However, the 1999 model, has increased horsepower, and offers all the whistle &amp; bells you would ever need.  It performs exceptionally well and certainly performs to intended design parameters and REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS!  

Isuzu is the largest manufacturer of trucks in the world and the Trooper platform is in use in over 118 countries.  It has evolved from the purist form of 4X4 utility vehicles.  Acura simply took a proven workhorse, and made it a bit more civilized.

So if you simply want a glorified station wagon to take the kids to soccer or to impress the neighbors, go out and get yourself a pretend SUV that's built on an automobile frame.  You probably shouldn't be driving a real SUV anyway.  You don't understand them.<br><br>
