            So you are interested in this digital camera? Well let me tell you, this camera is literally a piece of crap! I invested in this camera in hopes that would be all that it was hyped up to be. Was I ever so wrong! This camera is for sure not user friendly. It takes blury pictures. It's controls are setup very poorly. The included software is bogus and is quite misleading. One unexpected problem I ran into with this camera was the fact that the thing eats 4 double a batteries about every 20 pictures taken, thats not including the use of its other features as well. I found this camera to be without a doubt one of the worst investments I have ever made. I know this is a very negative review, but you must understand that I have had very negative results with this product. I consider Kodak to be a very top quality product, but they really let me down with this one! I hope you make a wise choice when purchasing your digital camera! Good Luck!<br><br>
