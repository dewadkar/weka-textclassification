            It is not possible to fully appreciate the NEW Chevrolet Impala without seeing one up close, and driving it - the pictures do it no justice.  In pictures the Impala seems to be a mid-sized sedan competing with the likes of Camry and Accord. In fact the Impala�s  price is very similar to a Toyota Camry LE, however the actual car is much closer in size and features to a Toyota Avalon XLS.  Already the Impala�s main strong point is obvious � VALUE.
At a price of just above $25,000, the top-of-the-line 2001 Chevrolet Impala LS comes equipped with such features as On-Star, traction control, leather, 16in wheels, driving lights, dual zone heating/AC.  A similarly equipped Camry will cost about $28,000, and is a smaller car.  The only thing lacking in the Impala is a competitive warranty. Toyota gives its owners a 5 year � 60,000 mile power train warranty in addition to the basic 3/36 bumper to bumper warranty.

Inside the Impala LS feels a little more like a Buick than Chevrolet.  Seats are big and comfortable.  An extended road trip from Los Angeles to Sacramento (and back 2 days later) meant lots of seat time, and not one complaint from driver or passenger.  CD/cassette stereo sounds good.  Unlike some other factory car stereos, the Impala�s sounds better as it gets louder � don�t tell your kids.  Stereo and ventilation controls are placed near the middle of the dash, making it easy for the driver and front passenger to operate. Steering wheel mounted radio controls make life a little easier. The dual zone climate control works especially well when front seat occupants are male and female.  The front passenger can raise or lower the temperature independent of the driver.  The Impala boasts lots of storage space for wallets, sunglasses and a center storage bin that will easily hold 10-12 CDs.  Rear seat will easily seat 3 adults, and seems to be made to do so. A sunroof  would be a nice addition.  This car is much bigger inside than its competitors and has a nice big trunk which comes with a cargo net.

On the road the Impala seems peppier than its 200 hp figure would suggest.  There is engine noise, but unlike some smaller cars, it sounds controlled. Handling is sporty, slightly firmer than even the semi-sporty Accord.  Ride is firm without being busy.  The main drawback with regard to the Impala�s ride; road noise.  Although not intrusive like many Chrysler products, the road noise is noticeable.  However this car�s mission is not luxury, but rather comfortable sportiness.  There are always tradeoffs. On the open highway there is little or none of the much dreaded �floating� feeling.  The suspension handles uneven pavement well, and transmits little of roughness to the driver.  Steering is quick and precise � all in keeping with the sporty theme.  The 4-wheel (ABS)  discs are firm and inspire confidence under heavy braking.

Overall the Chevrolet Impala LS is surprisingly good car.  Styling is subjective, but an up close and personal visit will produce a much larger and better looking car than one sees in photographs.  Also, the Impala is one of the few cars that look better  with a rear spoiler. The Impala is  Bigger than both Camry and Accord, with more features, and a lower price �the On-Star feature alone is enough to make it stand above the others. 

Given the competition, the Impala has its work cut out for it, but if you are shopping for a mid-sized sedan you owe it to your bank account to look at this car � it�s just too bad Chevrolet can�t offer a more competitive warranty.  It is worth mentioning that the cars with longer warranty period are often more expensive.  Nothing is free.

Compare the 2001 Impala to:

Ford Taurus -  Similar in size, features and price.
Toyota Camry  -  Smaller and more expensive.
Nissan Maxima  -  Also sporty, but smaller.
Honda Accord  -  A worthy alternative, more $$ with a V-6.
Toyota Avalon  -  Expensive with desired options.
Mazda Millenia  -  Dated design and more expensive.
