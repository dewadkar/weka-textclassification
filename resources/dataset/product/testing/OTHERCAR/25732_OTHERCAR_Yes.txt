                In reguards to the New Beetle,(I'm not an owner nor would I choose to be) I do own a 1961 VW BAHA,(Panther Pink).I have looked at various owners' vehicles and they say pretty much the same thing as (1eyedoc)!Now for the Old guys that still like to work on there cars,the New Beetle is not for the shade tree mechanic.There really is no way to fix this car with out taking it to the shop! Unless you would like to buy more tools just for this particular car.Case and point,my best friend knows a little more than I do for VW&quot;s and has purchased one of the new ones (1999). He says everything that 1eyedoc says,and alittle more.For instance1)Its more quiet than the old ones 2)It does handle better 3)It stops better. I have driven his new one,and he's right and 1eyedoc is correct! However for the old shade tree mechanic forget it!The Old Beetle still Rules!! 

     The things I like about the New Beetle is really the gas mileage, its really better than what I have (1961) or what my friend has (1957). The interior is better also, Cause it has just about everything that a luxury car has. Nice bucket seats with the lower lumbar supports, This is an option. Style for the new beetle is nice also cause as a driver from another vehicle it sure sticks out like a sore thumb. Driving the new beetle is rather a pleasure, do to the quietness and roominess and the 8 speaker stereo, with cd player!

      The things I love about the old beetle is the fact that it is an original,something a person can take a weekend and tune it up from top to bottom and from back to front easily without wondering if you did it right or wind up with extra parts cause they do not make an Idiot guide for the new one! The big factor is the engine is in the back where it should be on a VW!!!! 

      Now since I drive a baha I just imagine what some of you are thinking? Please let me answer your question now, The baha was the beetle before I chopped the rear end off! Makes engine removal real easy too.

      People who still like to work on the bug, this new beetle really is not for you. As for the person that likes comfort and reliability, indulge yourself!
