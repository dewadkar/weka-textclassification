            I've never used a digital before so I did a lot of research before buying this camera and I couldn't be happier.

The interface is so easy to use that even my wife who is not very good with electronics can easily handle it. The controls allow you to change the resolution, use flash, zoom, set a timer and many other things. The controls are easy to figure out and the camera easily connects to the computer. The 4MB Flash Card that comes with the camera is a little small, but will hold up to about 35 pictures on good resolution.

The programs that came with the camera are worth half the price of the camera. I have looked for this type of software for other uses and never found anything comparable. 

I would recommend this camera to any one looking in this price range.
