                 I just recently acquired my SC2 just a little while ago, but i love it so far. I leased mine with every possible option i could get, spare leather seats and an automatic transmission, and i didn't get those only because I didn't want them. Even with everything it has to offer, I still pay under $300 a month for the lease.
     The sales staff was excellent, and that's one of the big things Saturn is famous for. The people there treat you great and don't pressure you into anything. 
     I bought the SC2 because I wanted something sporty, but something economical, too. Being a Marine, I have to travel a lot, and the great gas mileage can save you a lot of money. The car handles like a dream. Never once have I felt like I was not in control.
     The only thing wrong is the lack of room in the back seat. My friends have trouble cramming even only two back there. But on the other hand, there's plenty of trunk space.
     I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who wants a sports car without the high price or maintenance. <br><br>
