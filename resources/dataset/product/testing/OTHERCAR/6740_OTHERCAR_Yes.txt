            I bought a 1990 Honda Accord LX 5 years ago.  Although it was used when I bought it, it was in great condition.  I was a freshman in College.  I still have this car.  I have been married 3 years now.  It is our main vehicle.  It is completely dependable.  I have never had any major problems with it.  I have 157,000 miles on it now and it still runs great.  It even looks good.

One of the best things about this car (especially living in Texas) is the air conditioning.  My 1994 Mazda Protege doesn't get half as cold as my 1990 Honda does.  The interior has held up beautifully.  

My husband and I trust this car on long road trips.  We've never had to worry if it will make a trip. 

This car has luxury suspension.  It is a very smooth ride.  

The only negative is I wish it had a little more get up and go.  I guess I should get a sports car for that.

This car is great for small families.  I will totally trust this car when I have kids.  

I suggest buying a late model, used Honda.  You will get years and miles of use from it with less cost than a new car.<br><br>
