            I bought this car looking for a vehicle to go to fancy things like weddings and well, fancy things.  So what else Rolls-Royce so I hopped over to my nearest Rolls dealer and bought me one.  I decided on the Park Ward because it goes well with my name.  I love the luxury of the vehicle it is kind of strange when someone asks you what that gold key goes to at the Wal-Mart check-out and you have to say, &quot;Oh that's just my Rolls.&quot;  I still haven't gotten in the hang of it.  The vehicle doesn't exactly run away from itself like a lot of my cars do but it handles fine like most luxury cars. I wouldn't take it out in the ice though.  The rear wheel drive make it a bear to handle on slick surfaces.  If you want a luxury car and are willing to pay an arm and a leg for it this is your car.  If you want something to go to work in every day go get yourself a Lincoln LS. <br><br>
