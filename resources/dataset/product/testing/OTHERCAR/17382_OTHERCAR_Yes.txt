            I waited five long years to buy a 2nd-gen Eclipse GSX, and in 1999, their final model year, I got one. And it was worth every minute of the wait! I cannot say enough about this little rocket. 
Unbelievable acceleration and handling, great braking, outrageous sound system (the Infinity premium system with 10-cd changer and in-dash cd/tape player, 8 speakers, amp), and a cockpit-like interior that you'd expect in a much more expensive sports car, all for less than $30,000.  
The five-speed transmission has a great feel to it and a very short throw. The turbocharger is smooth, powerful, and turbo-lag is minimal. Keep it over about 3500 rpm, and you can pretty much take off at will. It's got All-Wheel-Drive, which was the deciding factor for me. Being a rabid skier and snowboarder, I take it to the mountains almost every weekend and once or twice during the week. Through two winters, including the biggest snow season we've had here on the East Coast in five years (00-01) I never once had to worry about traction with this baby. It sticks to the road like it's on rails, whether it's dry, raining, sleeting, snowing, icy, whatever. Plus, I never have problems fitting all of my gear in the back, what with the split-fold-down seats and (relatively) large cargo bay. So long as you only have gear for one or two people, that is...
I have had some niggling problems, such as a bad power-mirror switch, and I've had the power lock actuators replaced (all warrantied work). The only out-of-pocket I've had is for a new rim. These soft aluminum jobs can bend fairly easily, so watch those potholes.
My only regret is that I will not be able to trade it in for a new GSX in a few years. Oh well. It is an imperfect world.
