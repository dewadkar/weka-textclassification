            I bought the DC4800 as I'd owned a DC260 before and while I'd had problems with the camera (dirt in viewfinder, problems with focus) Kodak had always been great about customer service, etc. and had fixed the problems at no charge.

I also wanted a camera with a faster recovery time (ie no long waits between taking shots etc.) and more megapixels.  I was taking a long trip and wanted to take the best camera I could.

Finally I was looking for a camera that handled CompactFlash as I already had cards.

Getting used to the 4800 was easy.  The interface is logical and not LCD menu-bound.  Lots of control is on the dial mechanism on the top.  I took a number of pictures in a row with no perceptable delay.  I think it'll do 5 pictures before it has to pause to recover which is fine for me.

While USB is fine I think its worthwhile buying the CompactFlash card reader that Kodak sells.  Its even faster than USB and works just like a disk drive including the ability to exchange non photos via it.

I like the size format.  Unlike the DC260 its not bulky or heavy.

Only negatives: 

o   that the exposure knob came off when I was travelling.  But its courrently with Kodak and they're expiditing the fix (two days and they'll return it to me.)

o   Lens is kinda long and doesn't recess

Photo quality is excellent, exactly what you'd expect from a camera in this price range.

Its a great camera for the more serious hobbyist.
