            Rip roaring fun and everlasting reliability are too complex to describe the all new Jeep Grand Cherokee. Some may use words like nice,clean comfortable or tough, but they all mean the same.This Jeep rocks. I would recommend it over the Dodge Durango or the Chevy Blazer.The four wheel drive system is the main reason that I bought this Jeep. It is great handling the harsh winter weather that we sometimes experience in the East. Another reason is the roomy interior and luxurious ergodynamics.The ergodynamics are the way this car like truck feels in the inside.It includes creature comforts like the soft curves of the center console or the firm sturdy seatbacks on my Jeep Model.
     Now let's talk about speed, damn this thing is powerful.Below I listed three accomplishments that I performed with the help of the torque swollen V-8. I dusted my girlfriend, she was driving my 1986 V-8 mustang. Granted, my mustang is older but I thought it really got its butt kicked. The second thing that I did was pull that same Mustang from Baltimore to Virginia using a trailer and the Cherokee's standard towing package. This was no small feat because the mustang weighs about 3,200 lbs.The third time I used the power of the Jeep was to pull my mother's 1982 Lincoln Towncar out of ditch when we had heavy rains here about 5 months ago.That Lincoln surely outweighs the Jeep but that &quot;son of a gun&quot; can pull. It's worth the money I pay in insurance and car payments and I would buy one again if not for the fact that my current one is so reliable. <br><br>
