                <b>C</b>adillac decided that the best way to fight back against luxury foreign import 4 door coupes such as the BMW 325i and Mercedes C class was to have its very own sport coupe. The Catera can be considered an Americanized version of the BMW 328i which also has an advanced quad cam V6 engine. While not as refined as the 328i the Catera does have its positive attributes.

     <b>W</b>ith features such as leather seats and air conditioning, this Cadillac is no poor relation, and should not in any way be confused with another Cimmaron, however this car does have its major faults. Fire up the quad-cam (200 hp, 192lb ft of torque) V6 and the Catera offers a good combination of handling and performance for most people. This car would be much more desirable if it had about 50 more horses on tap. The Cadillac Catera might be small compared to its larger brothers; the Deville and Seville, but it doesn't feel like it inside. The ride is comfortably soft, and yet there's almost roll free handling through the corners. Switching to performance mode via the 4-speed automatic utilizes all the power on tap to keep most drivers happy, however I felt the 3.0 lacked big time in power after 3rd gear. 

          This car may not have a V8, but the 3.0 liter German designed engine offers adequate power but comes up short compared to many other cars in its class. Its cast iron block is toped by two alloy cylinder heads at an unusual angle of 54 degrees. The heads have twin overhead belt driven camshafts opening 4 valves per cylinder. Although this engine does not have VVT (variable valve timing), the length of the intake manifold is altered through the rev range, with flaps opening to give three different intake lengths. This has a significant effect on torque production.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

     The <b>interior</b> of the 1998 Catera is luxurious yet cheap at the same time. Luxurious considering how plain this car is, and cheap because of some of the materials used. The cabin of the car retains a European flavor, with leather and wood used to add luxury. The seats are very supportive, Onstar is optional which uses GPS (global positioning system) via satellite technology and the cellular network to link the driver and the car with an Onstar advisor. Don't expect to find much wood in this car, there is some if you look real hard however. You would think with a 3,800lb curb weight this small car would be made of wood, well it's not, on the contrary there is more plastic than anything.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>
 
         The <b>exterior</b> is more than plain, it's almost 'cheap' looking. From a short distance, and from different angles, I have confused this car with Honda Accords, Dodge Neons, and even Honda Civics, even with my 20-15 vision. The small front grille & headlights come to an angle is a cheap fashion and there is hardly anything about this car that says "class." In later models the Catrera was updated with different styling cues, although this was not its saving grace, as it ended production soon after the 2001 model year and paved way for the 2003 CTS.


<i>Pricing/Conclusion:</i>
     
<b>The Cadillac Catera</b> brings European style driving to American buyers at a good price. As the entry-level Cadillac for 1998, this car boasted outstanding levels of equipment and an excellent chassis  for a somewhat fair price. This car 'new' ran for around $32,000  a used 1998 can be found from 14,000-18,000 dollars thanks to relatively poor resale value.    

   <b>Reliability</b> has been a big issue for the Catera, going into car chats on AOL, and talking to people who own them, this car has to be near the top of the most problematic cars list. I do not own  a Catera, and never have, so I can not comment personally on how reliable it has been for me. <b>ConsumerResports.Org</b> may have more info.
