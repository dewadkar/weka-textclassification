            Honda has done an excellent job of putting its name in our minds.  Think quality; Honda comes to mind.  Think durability; Honda comes to mind.  Think value; Honda comes to mind.  This is no accident; Honda has spent millions on advertising, and building quality products to ensure that we (American consumers) will associate the Honda name with all these positive things.

The CRV is Honda�s attempt to bring this name recognition into the SUV segment.  The competition is already at a disadvantage; it is a Honda after all.

I must be getting old.  I am becoming increasingly displeased with Honda�s small cars.  The Civic, Insight and CRV just don�t measure up the way Honda�s small cars use to.  For 12 years my primary car was a 1981 Honda Accord hatchback, I loved that car.  In fact I put nearly 300,000 miles on that car � and still sold it for $500 to some one who is most likely driving it today (if you see my beige hatchback, tell her hi for me).  The point is, in the 1980s, and 1990s, a Honda gave the buyer features other small cars simply did not offer, plus a level of comfort, quiet, and engineering the larger American cars lacked.

The CRV lacks the refinement I have come to expect from all Honda cars.  The interior is nice enough, but had several rattles and squeaks. The special edition comes with leather, CD, alloy wheels, rear privacy glass, chrome trim, and a few other cosmetic goodies.  It looks cute.  However, on the road the CRV feels cheap, and noisy.  Why so much engine noise?  The Honda Accord with a 4 cylinder is so smooth and quiet, why can�t the Civic and CRV feel the same?  Highway speeds bring even more noise, and those speeds come very slowly. The CRV is under-powered! At $22,000 I don�t want to listen to a buzzy engine downshifting all day long. The ride is somewhat smooth and handling is very good for a vehicle that sits up so high.  

The positive aspects are all wheel drive and handling, and interior space. Although you won�t tackle the Rubicon with a CRV, it does provide excellent traction in snow, and gravel, not to mention wet pavement. Other pluses include storage spaces galore, and very high level of utility.  The CRV comes with a table built in the rear cargo area � it�s cute.  Also in the rear is a watertight storage bin, good for snowy or sandy boots.  I think it will also work as an ice chest � at least that�s what I was told.  Pop out cup holders for rear seat passengers is a nice touch.  The CRV has one of the best A/C systems ever.  I don�t know how they do it. Even on a 100 degree day, I found myself turning the fan DOWN because it was just too cold.

Overall the Honda CRV is merely adequate.  I don�t mean to damn with faint praise, but I (and all of us really) have come to expect so much from Honda.  The CRV is not a bad car; it�s just that I know they can do better. If you are in love with the CRV, you probably won�t be unhappy buying one.  Besides if past Honda cars are any indication, it will never break.

A final note: The special edition package is worth the extra money.  Many current CRV owners where ogling the gold paint and matching colored bumpers.
