            Last February, my old nova needed to be put to rest.  I had spent lots of time and money maintain it.  I am a full time college student and also work full time, so my car wasn't getting me from point a to point b anymore.  I guess the last straw was the transmission blowing up on a road trip. I needed something reliable, and I needed it fast. so off I went in search of a new car.

I searched through the paper and I saw a great ad for this kia.  I had seen many commercials and read great things about it so I immediately tried to get one. The warranty and price of this car really attracted me to it.  After a few days of nervousness and being excited, I had bought my first new car.

i immediately fell in love with it.  Everything about it was great. The stereo was far from mediocre, very quiet and smooth ride, and just generally comfortable.  I also liked the modern look to it.  However I noticed that the car was a bit light, and gusts of wind took a tool on it.  This really didn't bother me until we got a snow and ice storm.  My brand new car was doing 25 mph and still slid right into a ditch, coming an inch away from a tree.  To this day, anytime it is windy or fowl weather comes, you can expect my car to be all over the place.

Another problem that arose, was that 3 months into owning the car, a wire came loose that made the car die.  I was very frustrated.  I mean it was brand new. I had it towed and fixed, but it was still a little unsettling  however, I took this car on a road trip this summer and had no problems whatsoever.  It is very comfortable to ride in for long periods of time.

All in all, I think this is a great, reliable car. However I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that has winter weather unless you like being in a ditch.<br><br>
