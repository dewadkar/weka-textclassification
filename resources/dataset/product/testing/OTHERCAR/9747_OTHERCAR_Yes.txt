            I bought this camera recently at Walmart for $400 after taxes. I bought this camera because it is ideal for a beginner, who wants a camera that takes nice pictures, but doesn't want to put a ton of thought into a picture. This camera thinks for you. I just recently came home from New  York City. All my friends say that my pictures look like postcards. I have to say that I think so too! 

One feature I love is that it has 12 different picture modes...they are Portrait, Landscape, Fireworks, Party/Indoor, Sunset, Close Up, Night Portrait, Night Landscape, Copy, Beach/Snow, Museum, and Back Light. I love using the modes. Like I said earlier, they do the thinking for you. It also has just a straight up auto metering mode for just the average picture.

It has one touch upload, which is very nice. No more waiting around for your pictures to upload. You can upload 50 pics to your computer in less than 3 minutes. I like that very much! 

I am not a photography expert. I just like to take pictures, a lot of pictures! I think that any amateur photographer would really enjoy this camera. It is well worth the price. It comes with a 8mb memory card. I like to shoot in fine resolution, so I recommend at least a 32mb flash card. 

It also has a self timer. You can purchase a neat little tripod called "the pod", which is like a little bean bag for $14.99 to go with it. I can't remember the website; just do a search. Combine that with your self timer and you can shoot family portraits!

The battery is lithium. I really like it. It stays charged through a day of lots of photos. It only takes two hours to recharge the battery. 

You can shoot in fine resolution, and you can enlarge up to 8x10's.

This review rambles, I know. Don't hesitate, just go buy it. It is great!
