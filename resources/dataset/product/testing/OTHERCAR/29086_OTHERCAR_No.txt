            This vehicle was strongly recommended for driving in the snowy conditions of north Ohio weather.  OK, the windshield defrosts fast, so what, if the seal on the windshield is broken, its not much help.
    I hate this vehicle and here's why:  it now has 4500 miles on the odometer, it has been in the shop for much of its young life.  One fine winter evening while driving alone on 71 north in Ohio, an unbelievable noise developed, apparently under the hood.  It was so loud I could not hear the radio.  Since I was running OK and did not fancy myself (a lone female) on the roadside, I elected to head home-some 30 miles away.  I got home safely, called for help, the car was returned to the shop and discovered to need a new seal on the front windshield-it had about 2000 miles on it at the time.  The dealer expected it and I had the car back in about a week.

     Shortly thereafter, I noticed a sincere reluctance for the car to shift gears; back to the dealership for 2 weeks this trip-they didn't have the parts, but guess what-they were expecting the problem.  Greater  insights than mine mentioned that the whole transmission was replaced.
      Last week a large puddle of antifreeze was noted under the front of the car-back to the dealership for a week, while they replaced the thermostat.
       This vehicle is a lemon, the dealer could not care less and I am going to get rid of it.  In addition to being over priced and of very little value, it is a wimp.  My previous Lincoln Navigator is much rougher and tougher, faster and awesome on slidey, icy snow.  I am going back to Lincoln.
