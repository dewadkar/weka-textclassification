            I bought my 2000 Honda Civic EX because I wanted something quick, stylish and reliable.  I had already driven the 2000 VW Jetta and the 2000 Ford Focus by the time I hit the Honda lot.  While I loved the Jetta and the Focus, the options I wanted were unavailable to me.  A moonroof was important, and the Focus doesn't have one on any model.  The Jetta however, had one, but I had to upgrade to a GLS, which I couldn't afford. 

Then I found my Honda.  The Civic EX has an amazingly peppy 1.6 Liter V-Tec Engine.  SOOO fun to drive.  It also came with ALL of the options I wanted at a very reasonable price.  It's great to drive, the five speed is very easy.  My only complaint, (and it's a small one), is that you have to rev the engine to almost 6000 rpms before you feel the 127 horsepower engine kick in.  The great thing about Honda's, (I've had a few), is the tightness of the engine....not to mention the reliability factor.  It will run forever as long as you change the oil every 5000 miles and get your timing belt changed every 60000 miles.

Something else to think about, the Honda Civic interior is nothing exciting.  They are definitely designed with function in mind.

I think this vehicle is ideal for those who want great vehicle performance, but are on a budget.  Obviously, it's the perfect vehicle for a commuter as well, it get's 36 mpg.  <br><br>
