            The Olympus D-340R is a great camera. Although it may not be top of the line for what is currently out in the market, it sure is a great camera for $300. 

When this camera was released, it was very expensive. If my memory is correct, it was around $400-500 dollars. Slowly the price started to fall and when it fell from 400 to 300, I knew that I had to own this camera.

I have owned many Olympus products in the past, ranging from old film cameras to new digital cameras. This one is the best one yet.

When taking a picture, it has a helpful LCD screen in back of it. The LCD basically lets you look through the camera's eyes. You can see what the picture would look like before you even take it. The camera also has a regular camera viewfinder which you can use to take pictures when the batteries may be low. 

This camera has strong brilliant colors. Thats one of the reasons why I bought this camera. Once I saw the demo pictures (at www.olympus.com) of what the pictures look like from this camera, I knew I had to own this. 

This camera uses Smartmedia cards and includes an 8MB card, which can hold about 120 Low quality pictures (640x480), OR 40 High Quality pictures (1280x960-compressed) OR 11 Super High Quality pictures (1280x960-uncompressed). When I take pictures, I use the HQ setting because there isn't that much of a noticiable difference between HQ and SHQ. The best thing about this camera is once you've filled up your card, all you have to do is delete a picture that came out bad or upload the pictures to a pc for printing. For instance, lets say that you own a regular film camera, and you're on vacation. When you get back home, you get the pictures developed only to find out that one of the pictures didn't come out well. This problem is non-existant with the D-340R because you can view the picture about a second after you take it. And the expensive picture developing costs are gone too. The pictures taken at the HQ setting make great 4x6 pictures on able any printer (I've printed pictures from Hp printers, Epson printers, and Canon printers)

Another great feature of this camera is the TV-out cable that comes with it. With this, you can attach your camera an RCA (yellow) video in port on a TV or VCR and have your own mini slide shows. 

Overall, I found that owning this camera was a nice experience and I would recommend this camera and ALL olympus cameras to anyone. The only thing that I did not really like about the camera is how it sucks down batteries. If you are going to get this camera-- Buy rechargeable NiMH batteries. This thing can go through alkalines in a day (if you use the LCD screen to take pictures a lot.)<br><br>
