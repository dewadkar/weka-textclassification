            'Leased a new  Audi A4 2.8 Quattro in 1996.  This absolutely one of the best cars I have ever driven.  My family and friends believe so, too!  Great looks and impressive drive packaged neatly for under $29,000 during our acquisition.  I'm happy to say it's worth almost every $$$.  I'd hate to say &quot;goodbye&quot; to this wonderful car someday but another Audi, the A6, is &quot;calling out my name!&quot;

Since '96, my A4 never seized to amaze me!  I always feel proud each time I know I'll be taking it for a drive.  I still admire its sleek lines and very modern design.  The stock 16&quot; star-patterned mag wheels and wide oval tires usually catch my attention.  It's unfortunate that Audi doesn't equip the A4s with fog lamps underneath the front bumper like that of the A6.  That will definitely keep me staring a bit longer.  Nevertheless, the A4 is a beautiful car.

Entering the A4 finds no difficulty and immediately welcomes me into its magnificent cabin.  The sport steering wheel &quot;pulls my hands like a magnet&quot; for a firm caress.  I can't wait for those red instrument lights to go on!  My seats hug me like I truly belonged.  The gentle sound of the smooth V-6 invites me to roll those tires.  Then, the rest is pavement history! 

This is not a fast car, but who needs another speeding ticket?  This is a smooooth car!  I'd have to turn on the superb stereo system just to hear another great thing this machine can entertain me with. Then, I'm usually tempted to search for  the most winding roads the world has to offer... this is where the A4 is at its best element.  The tighter the curve, the more impressive the car gets to be! The Quattro system and the highly-developed A4 suspension are simply magical.  This car can take any abuse you can dish out on it and still win over!  This is also truly an all-weather performer.  This car kept me &amp; my family safe and secure even during the worst driving conditions.  The A4's performance hasn't let me down yet, and I don't expect it to.

Departing from the luxurious cabin and its well laid out ergonomics is, at most times, a sad moment for me.  I'm gonna miss all that I came to admire when I got in.  With adoration, I tend to rub the wood trims that wrap around the dash and doors and shine on the center console. And, just like my entry, exiting is just as easy.  Looking away is not.

There hardly things I can say to discredit this car.  The only unusual problems I've ever had in the 50,000 miles I've accumulated so far are that of the window and moonroof mechanisms which tend to have a mind of its own occasionally.  Audi dealership service usually relieves the problems for some time until they re-occur.  But, this doesn't bother me since I just love the service I get from Audi each time I bring my A4 in for service.  Their bumper-to-bumper warranty is one of the best anywhere! And, this is all-inclusive:  oil changes, wiper blades, etc. are free of charge!

I have a little over 50,000 miles on my odometer now but I know this car will easily outlast my expectations.  Ownership after the lease is definitely a good consideration.  But, acquisition of other Audis is not far from my mind.  Just like my A4, they'll most likely &quot;make a believer out of me!&quot;
