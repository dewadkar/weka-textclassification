Nissan has needed a redesign of the Sentra since 1997, that model was economical and affordable but difficult to look at. Along comes the fresh looking Sentra for 2000 � and not a minute too soon.  However, Nissan has taken that car a step further now offering many different models based on that one, well built and sporty canvas.  The Sentra is available in SE, XE, GXE and SE-R trim levels.  Should you want to enjoy an affordable and sporty sedan while saving the planet, Nissan has you covered there as well.  The Nissan Sentra CA (short for Clean Air), is an attempt to sell you the social consciousness of an electric car with the fun and convenience of a normal car � is there anything this platform can�t do?

To the casual observer, the Sentra CA looks just like a normal compact car. Well, normal for Nissan, their cars do have a bit of style that seems to be missing in others such as the Corolla, Civic, Cavalier etc.  Remember when the Nissan Maxima was advertised as a �four door sports car� and when magazine ads touted the old Sentra SE-R as the spiritual predecessor to the Datsun 510 and BMW 2002?  One can only hope Nissan is getting back to the good ole days of performance and style.  Back to the Sentra CA. It looks like a normal car, with the exception of the large �clean air vehicle� decals stuck to the rear doors.  Nissan says they can be �easily removed� but also points out that a least one customer was upset when the unsightly decals were removed without his/her permission.  Sounds reasonable, half the fun of buying an environmentally friendly car is letting everyone else know that YOU are not �part of the problem.�  How selfless.
Other than the decals, the Sentra CA is quite unremarkable.  In fact the car is notable for it�s unremarkable-ness.

From behind the wheel, one would never suspect the space age technology being utilized under the hood. Double walled exhaust, quick catalyst warm up and a radiator that has a special coating which actually changes ground level ozone (smog) into oxygen � this car is cleaning the air ! It also meets California�s strict SULEV emissions requirements for the year 2004.  Frankly the Sentra CA is the cleanest burning gas engine currently for sale, and most drivers will never sense anything different when compared to other compact sedans.  The 1.8L engine produces 122 hp, that is 5 less than a non CA Sentra, but it�s hard to notice on the road.  Acceleration is adequate, but typically cars in this price range (about $15,000) are anything but powerful.  Merging onto the freeway is no problem (can�t wait for the Sentra SE-R).  Road noise is minimal for a small car, and the automatic transmission shifts smoothly.  The main, or perhaps only, drawback to the Sentra CA is what seems to be a higher than normal overdrive ratio.  At times the Sentra seems to bog down under light acceleration, my suspicion is that this is done purposely to keep engine RPMs down, thereby lessening emissions.  Handling is precise and a huge improvement over previous Sentras.  The Sentra has a sportiness to it similar to the Honda Civic, but which is lacking on the Corolla.

Inside the Sentra CA is a basic, normal car interior.  Nissan has improved the materials used inside the Sentra, the overall look and feel is much more pleasing.  The dash, audio controls, seats and gauges all have the look and feel of a car costing much more.  AM/FM/CD is standard, but  a cassette player is nowhere to be found. People do still listen to cassettes don�t they? I must be getting old.  The stereo actually sounds very good and rivals the stock stereo found in the Honda Insight and Civic.  Button and switches fall nicely to hand.  Nissan has included a nifty storage area on the top part of the dash, not so unusual, but this one is covered.  Finally a place to keep sunglasses out of sight and out of the hot sun..  Rear seat room is a bit cramped, but then again this is a small car.  

Overall, the 2001 Sentra CA is reasonably adequate car. It does everything it�s asked to, and more.  There really is nothing exceptional about this little car, and that is just how it should be.  Many people don�t want to ruin the environment, it�s just that they want to not ruin the environment in as simple a way as possible.  Nissan has answered the call, no charging stations, no limited driving range and no hassle.  Besides, the Sentra is good looking car as well.  What more could you ask � save the planet, don�t look dorky. It�s just that simple.
