            This Quest gets the job done.  It aint fancy but it looks good and the passengers absolutely love it. My wife and I traveled from New Jersey to Arizona in about 2 days.  It was great.

It is quiet, the sound system is great, good CD Player, and the roof TV and VCR are better than the Honda minivan.  The playstation is fun to play also.  The VCR (or whatever is playing) makes the stereo system's surround sound better than a movie theater.

The tinted windows are nice too.

We put on a hitch and pulled a 10 foot U-Haul from California to Arizona with no problems.  It cruised fine and was actually powerful up hills.  The gas mileage suffered with the U-Haul, but it got the job done very well.

The OverDrive button is important when passing people on a 2 lane highway. Be very careful when passing because most cars downshift enough so that you get moving fast to pass.  The Quest is a bit timid and does not pass that well when going from 65 mph to 75 mph for example.

The acceleration around town is great.  It's peppy and likes to go fast.  The seating is comfy for the driver and is great for long trips.  The seat is high enough, the mirrors are good too. 

I could go on and on. For the best value a Quest is quite possibly the best buy. Not only is it inexpensive compared to the Honda, it has a low cost of ownership (so far) :-)
