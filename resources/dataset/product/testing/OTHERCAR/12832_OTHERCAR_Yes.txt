            First of all, you can't pass by a Rav4 without admiring the cute factor.  Sharp lines as well as curves.  She's a beaut!
I test drove 5 of these SUV's as well as a few other Versions of the smaller SUV family.  I'm 5'11, so, leg space was the almighty number one concern (immediately following statistics of course!). When I first sat in the Rav4, I immediately felt like I was about to be ejected. The angle of the seat made my feet push into the floor.  This sensation was easily reversed by giving a few pumping twists to the funky round knob on the side of the seat.  This feature, unfortunately, is not available to the passenger seat.  But what do I care, I'm the driver !

I'm not sure who posted it but, I believe I read that they thought the Rav4 rode like a luxury car.  Well, ok.  I don't agree with that comparison at all.  I would say the Rav4 has a more car like ride than a pickup does but, it still has its limits, washboard roads still feel like washboard roads...only not as bad. BUT, it has a FULL SIZE SPARE!

I like to drive and I feel a need to have all my personal *stuff* within reach. Cd's, beverage, tissues ..small personal items.  I have to say the center console isn't all that accommodating to my needs as a needy person. The lidded console is perfectly big enough for one square box of tissue. Nowhere for my cd's. Reaching to the glovebox during travel isn't exactly safe!  Plus, the ashtray sits right behind the beverage holder, how much sense does that make?

I had to drive 17 hundred miles and had to pull a 5x8' trailer.  The Rav4 whipped about a bit more than the average nerves are prepared to take.  

Overall, I'd recommend giving the Rav4 serious consideration. The feel of being in control of a very sound vehicle is evident behind the wheel of a Rav4.

I have to say, Most of you didn't do your homework when negotiating a price.  Mine was fully loaded, the L package. The only things I didn't have were the moon roof, side tubes & leather seats.  I still managed to get a FANTASTIC deal.  The invoice after accessories was $19,998.. after dealer markup, it was $22,474 on the lot.  I had a 1993 Nissan King Cab as a trade in.  I drove home my Rav4 after paying $16,787.

Keep in mind, while you're shopping for a new vehicle, don't forget that the salesman will be your first link to the new vehicle.  If you don't feel comfortable with the salesman, if you feel pressured or rushed, if you feel like he/she could care less if you buy from him or not, you have the right to leave that lot and without a reason!  If your salesman says things like "Listen, I could get in trouble for telling you this..." or "My boss wouldn't even consider that" or "You'd be crazy to pass this up", don't be afraid to tell him/her you're just looking right now. Don't let ANYONE talk you into something you don't feel absolutely positive about.  Do not talk about your trade in until you've been able to reach a price you want to negotiate with. After you do that, THEN offer your trade in.  I find myself in need of even MORE discount! So, after negotiating a trade in value (Check the blue book value of your trade in!!!!!!!! before you go shopping for a new car!), it never hurts to ask your car salesman to ask the "boss" to go a few hundred lower on the total cost, you'd be surprised how often they will.  Specifically, I said "Hey, tell your boss I'll pay $16,600 for it, we'll call it a deal"  The salesman came back and said "He said he won't go lower than $16,700"  I said, I'll take it.  We bartered for a while and we developed a cordial rapport, bargaining for my new Rav4 was a good experience. BOB HOWARD AutoPlex ROCKS!
