            Toyota's continue to amaze me. They build the very best car in the world --- period. I've owned my share of vehicles including Mercedes, Jaguar, Cadillac, Lincoln to name a few, and have been totally satisfied with Toyota's since I discovered their qualities a few years ago. 

Just picked up a new 03 Avalon XLS with all the options except the GPS system. Even my 16 year old son was totally impressed when he saw this gleaming new pearl white beauty --- with the wing --- he couldn't stop playing with the dials etc. 

We've been out shopping for a few weeks now and after reviewing this model and that car and almost buying a new Town & Country, we kept coming back to Toyota simply for their reliability track record. Having owned two Camry V6's I knew I wanted that engine. 

This new Avalon is so much larger inside than the Camry and the back seat feels more like you're in an E class Mercedes than a Toyota. It's as large back there as the big Lexus, I know cause we had one of those too. One thing I need to deprogram myself from saying is 'I wish we Americans could build such a car.' I need to be reminded that most Japanese vehicles are built right here stateside. 

I am impressed with the ride, the sound system, the excellent craftsmanship and all those other neat electronics like rain sensing wipers that are part of this car. Then, after reading about the Vehicle Skid Control System option, I made sure I ordered that. 

Imagine loosing control on a wet street, for example, and the Skid Control System computer automatically takes over controlling each wheel independently to help you safely gain back control. You continue steering, yet by adding power or braking to each wheel as the computer deems appropriate, the Skid Control System can make you another Phil Hill so you can live to drive another day. Isn't technology wonderful. 

Evidently the SCS is made available to only the Avalon XLS from the big Lexus. Do a Google search to read more on this fantastic option. 

This is the very best vehicle I could have bought. Sure the 750iL BMW has some whoop-de-do things that are above and beyond the call of automotive duty and the Lexus 430 LS is in a league of its own, but for the money - and then some ---- you too can get one of these hidden gems. 

The Avalon has got to be the best kept secret anywhere. So many people are driving around in their Camry's, never realizing that for only a bit more money they too could be living the lap of luxury with room to die for. Once you test drive this car, if you've got your senses about you, and you are not dead set on spending $60,000 on something else, this should more than meet your needs. 

The styling is not for everyone, as well it should be, but I love it. Understated POP is the way I can best describe my feelings. Not a glaring look yet it manages to stand out in the crowd. 

The one thing I'm looking forward to judging is the mileage. Since I believe we will be seeing rising gas prices soon, I'll be interested to see if this car actually can pull off the mid 20's for average MPG driving. If so, that alone, is worth the price of admission. Most vehicles in this size are lucky to manage the mid teens. I've read and talked to others who are very pleased at the mileage they consistently get. Something to do with the new Toyota engine technology.
