            (The setting: the kitchen of the golden girls studio set.  Imagine a scruffy looking guy sitting there staring at the camera.)
Picture it:
Southfield Michigan.  1997.
A young man and his father journey to a car dealership for the child's first car to be purchased by himself.
(Cut to a scene at a run down car dealership.)
I first walked into this dealer ship unsure of what I was actually looking for or even what I really wanted.  I was using my father's 1989 Ford Tempo until I ran it over 300,000 miles and the engine fell out of it.  Seriously, it did.  Anyway, I was thinking something along the lines of a Ranger, maybe a beefed up S-10; something that had class and wouldn't look like my father gave it to me. 
So, I looked around, saw this extreamly beautiful car.  It was a 1992 Olds Acheiva SC.  Still don't know what the SC stands for, but I liked it.  Still do; if it ran.  
Now, I purchased this car thinking that I was now a member of the human race, I had a reliable car, a steady girlfriend (which I ended up marrying), and was just entering the ever expanding field of Computers.  Things couldn't look better.
Well, let me tell you, it didn't look better, it started to look worse.  This car has Hoosier Low-Profile, non-rotational tires on it. (Approx $200 a piece.)  Rare prime 3-spoke chome rims,  Tinted windows, dual exhaust and one kicking stereo system.  Well, only ONE WEEK after I got it home, I guess I slammed the door shut too hard cause the driver side window dissapeared.  I took it back to the dealer.  &quot;Sorry, you bought it as is. . .We can't do anything about it.&quot;  Fine.  Notice that the power seats no longer wanted to accomodate my hiney.  Fine.  Notice that the breaks are going?  I can do that.  $240 worth of pads, shoes and rotors?  Fine.  It works.  It looks good, and I'm once again happy with my now uncertinable purchase.  Remind you, this is all BEFORE I EVEN GOT PLATES ON THE CAR!
To make a long story short, I recently got rid of this nightmare adding only about 10,000 miles on it in 3 years because it was either on blocks or in the shop the other time.  I have pumped more then $2,000 in repairs on this mechanical nightmare for nothing in return.  Let me tell you everything that was wrong with it when I got rid of it. (You'll love this part. . .I guarentee it better then GM could..)  Okay, here goes:
The engine mounts and the transmission mounts broke somehow and the engine/tranny contraption is sitting on the CV joint, making the car &quot;shudder violently&quot; when you drive it anywhere at any speed.  The power windows stopped working.  The alarm had to be removed because it once activated itself while I was driving on the freeway.  The driver's side door lock wouldn't accept a key.  The brakes had to be replaced (again.).  The Cylinder head was cracked; in 8 different places.  The power seats still didn't work.  The speaker covers in the doors fell out with the speakers by themselves one day.  (Go Figure.)  And last but not least, Every time you turned the lights on, the fuse would blow for the starter.  I still haven't fingured that one out, but I still carry around a huge box of 10 amp fuses just in case.
Basically, stay away from this car at all costs.  If you see one coming at you at the end of the street, quickly turn around before your car gets the bug that it carries with it.  It may look good, but PLEASE, I BEG YOU, don't even try to sit in it.  It may try to pull you in with it's good looks.
