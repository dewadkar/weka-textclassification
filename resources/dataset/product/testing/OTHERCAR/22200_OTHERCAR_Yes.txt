            I bought this camera about two years ago, to log the progress of a home I was building.  It was my first digital camera, and I haven't picked up a 35 mm camera since.

This is a great camera!  The picture quality is even better than what I got on my old 35 mm cameras (Olympus Stylus and Canon SureShot Telezoom).  The zoom works well, and takes great vacation photos.  I've taken it to Europe and the Caribbean, with consistently excellent results.   Although many cameras now offer 3 or 4 megapixels, to be honest, 2 megapixels is fine for anyone used to 35 mm photography.  I've had several 5X7 prints made from this camera, and was very pleased with the results!  

It uses Compact Flash cards, which are cheaper than some other formats out there.  I picked up a 256 meg card for $60 a year ago, and can fit over 400 "best" quality compression pics on it -- plenty for a two-week trip!  The flash works well, and I was even able to take some decent pictures during an NHL game, with the flash disabled.

Another benefit is that it uses four AA batteries, which are easy to pick up anywhere you travel.  You can purchase an optional rechargeable battery pack/charger from Kodak -- it handles 110 and 220 volts, so with a simple $10 plug adaptor from Radio Shack, you can take it overseas and recharge your batteries.

If you have an older computer without a USB port, this camera also includes a serial cable connection, so you can upload your pictures without buying a special card reader.

The major drawback of this camera is its size.  It's too big to fit in most coat pockets comfortably, especially compared with other cameras available on the market now.   Also, be forewarned that the lens cap is a detachable piece of rubber attached to a string on the hand strap.  It will come off easily, so you have to be cautious about not marring the lens.
