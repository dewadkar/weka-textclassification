            I purchased a leftover 1999 Nissan Maxima GXE in 2000.  It is the greatest car I have ever owned and also a breath of fresh air after driving a FORD for 5 years prior.  Purchasing this car was a breeze also.  You see the V6 is standard equipment.  So I did not have to sort through the tech-babble of 1 or 2 underpowered 4-cyl engines before I got engine that I wanted.  A/C and Power windows are also standard equipment.  Most of this vehicles main competition cannot make this claim either.   Synthetic oil and premium gasoline seem to have insured that this car runs as good as the first day that I started it!

Overall this is an awesome car to drive and own.  The car performance speaks for itself.  Drive one and you�ll see what I see. This is the only car I have ever owned that I can say �hands down� in 10 Years I will run to my Nissan dealer to purchase another Maxima.
