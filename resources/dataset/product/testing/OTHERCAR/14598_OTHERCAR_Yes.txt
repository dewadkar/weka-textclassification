            There is just something about the Honda Accord. It seems like every crazy dude I know who doesn't have a lot of money owns one of them. It's actually a really nice car for its price! Sure its not the most beautiful car in the universe but I have always thought function to come before form. I mean its got a nice ride, it requires very little maintenance, it's got good gas mileage, the AC works just fine, and it has a CD player which my current car doesn't! It also seems to last quite a while. I think this is the all around all american car, even if it is made in some shop across the sea :) It has everything you could possibly need for a price that those of us with crappy jobs can afford. Well it's not exactly an outdoors vehicle so I guess if your going hunting or are hauling large cargo you should get something a little bigger, but everybody else needs to get a Honda! If for no other reason than its wonderful automatic seatbelts!<br><br>
