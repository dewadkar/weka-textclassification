            This camera is GREAT!! I was spending $35 /week between film and developing for photos for my ebay auctions. Some did not come out well and of course you don't know that until you get them back. So with this camera, I can take the photo, instantly see it and do a re-take if necessary. I also have the photos downloaded to my computer in minutes.
No more scanning all of them. It take GREAT close-ups. Many of my bidders have asked me what I used for a camera to take such detailed close-ups of small items. It will do this well using macros or the 2x zoom. I can take a photo with 2 inches of an object. The flash can be a bit bright at times, but when it is too bright, I just hold my finger over the flash.
You also have your choice of how big the photos are. With the 8mg card that comes with it, you can choose settings of 2,18,32,36,122 photos before you have to download.<br><br>
