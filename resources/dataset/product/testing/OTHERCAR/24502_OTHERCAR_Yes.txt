            How many times have you ever seen a 308 GT4 advertised and thought "what a pity that is so ugly...? 
In my early twenties I was writing for an auto magazine and had the opportunity of publish a road test of a GT4. I had never driven a Ferrari before and as soon as I toke the wheel I feel myself very, very special. I could see everybody looking at me, in my bright red Bertone-bodied 70's supercar. I was pottering around town easily due to the low rpm torque of the four cam 3-litre V8, in spite of a heavy steering and clutch. 
Out at speed the dog-leg gear selector was a challenge for almost the first 100 km, but once mastered I still remembered the click-click every time I changed. The engine was not as musical as the V12's and even hot V8's, due to that the firing order was as a double-four cylinder in order to increase the low speed torque. That means that the soundtrack was as you had two twincam Lotus engines in your back! Not much exotic but it produced an aggressive bark over 6500 all the way to the 7700 red line.
Today the performance is well over the average hot hatchback, and is easy to control over the limit of adhesion, with a superb steering and brakes of the pre-abs era.
On the practical side, the carburetted engine is easy to maintain by every competent specialist, has a decent boot and, the most important and useful feature of this car, has room for two children or one enthusiast, or for some groceries bags or a jacket. It has even more space than a 911!
Best of all the average price is incredible low. As some marvellous persons has no exterior beauty, but is full of passion within. No one enthusiast will be dissatisfied with this.
