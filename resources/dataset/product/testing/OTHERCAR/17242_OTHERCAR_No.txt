            Since no area exists for the 91 es250, I'm using this space.  I test drove and kept an es250 overnight to &quot;try out&quot; when I was shopping for a used car some time ago.  My overall impression of the car was favorable for the price and equipment it offered.  

For those of you ot familiar with the es250, it was one of the 2 cars Lexus started with in the US in 1990...the big brother LS400 being the other car.  The es250 was basically a V6 toyota Camry with all options, leather, wood accents, and fancy wheels with lexus logos.  Minor differences like altered lights also existed.

The es250 is a good car overall.  The ride is quiet, the seats are comfortable, and the styling is conservative.  I really love how lexus did not try to make this a sports sedan like some car makers do.  In my opinion, there is no such thing as a sports sedan.  Four doors means you have kids and your days of sporty driving are over!  You might be thinking &quot;Yeah buddy what about the BMW M5?&quot;.  I don't consider a $70K car a sedan.  BMW just added 2 doors to a muscle car so the wives of the guys that buy this thing won't throw them out of the house.

All of that stuff aside, the drivetrain and powerplant on the es250 is top quality!  The shifts are hardly perceptable and the egnine pulls strongly.  The excessive power assist steering is also a blessing since this luxury car is all about isolation from the road like EVERY luxury sedan should be.

The interior is also very nicely done, but I really did not like how a camry dashi s just transplanted into this thing and has wood glued on.  There are a bunch of sharp angles and protrusions in the design.  A more rounded and ergonmically correct dash would have been better.  Also, the speedo and the accompaning instrument cluster is flat out CHEAP!  The materials from which they are made look like they came out of a Hyundai.  Lexus should have designed the electroluminescent display found in the LS400 into this model as well.  

Dealer support for this model is non-existent!  Thsi is the reason I did not purchase the car.  I called several dealers to get quotes on regular maintenance and none of them gave me a straight answer.  They said &quot;It is an older model which we really don't service&quot;.  This is the blacksheep of the Lexus family.  The company wants to deny they built it or something.  In fact, one dealer told me to call Toyota to get it serviced as a Carmy.  That dealer said he would do it, but I would waive my rights to a warranty because they are not servicing ther own make.  HELLO! Lexus is Toyota!  

After all of this red tape I cut through, I decided on an Acura because dealer support was much better.  I'm happy with the choice I made because my Acura Vigor is a nice ride which is pretty rare.  Also, Vigor owners have a sort of comrodary between e/o.  We always smile or wave to fellow owners on the roads while Lexus drivers seem to try to out snob e/o by raisning their noses higher than a fellow owner.  Lexus is a good make and the es250 is a bargain priced car.  However, you should consider the dealer support before you buy.  You can get a Vigor for the same price and have a better car!  I don't recommend the es250.  <br><br>
