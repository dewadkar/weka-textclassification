            At $200 you can't get a better camera. In fact for under $300 I think this is the best deal. My sister has a 3 megapixel Kodak digital camera and I can't see any significant difference in the quality in prints up to 8x10 size.

                            Pros

The camera is smaller than most cameras, especially the hp digital cameras. However, it is a little on the thick side.
The print quality is magnificent. I print "perfect" 8x10's. The zoom lens is also great and works beautifully. All my friends love the camera's look and think it's great. The lens protector comes in handy and the buttons are placed perfectly on the camera.

The camera is also feature rich. The video clips work wonderful in "bright" settings, and video cam is cool as well. 

I've heard some negative comments about the camera's flash and zoom lens distortion. However, I never noticed any of that in the 100's pictures I have taken. In fact when i first got the camera i wanted to test the flash, and i turned all the light off, closed all the blind, and in complete darkness I took pictures of everything I couldn't see. My friends didn't beleive me when I showed the pic.'s and told them I took them in complete darkness. They came our bright nad rich as always, I'm not kidding. They came out fine in complete darkness. However, after about 12 feet away the camera did not pick up anything. So it's not a far flash, but a good flash. As for the distortion I have rarely noticed it, and only other experts examining the picture closely will notice it. But for someone just enjoying looking at pics, it's not obvious.

The camera's batteries, lasted for the first week of having it, which is good for digital cameras. In fact this camera handled the batteries much better than my old hp 315. However, like "all" digital cameras is cost wise to get some rechargeables, they really come in handy.e
The new memory card on the 2650 is cool at penny size. It holds  dozens of photos and clips. On my upgraded 32 mb card I can take about 20 high quality pics and about 5-7 high quality videos. However, in low quality, I can take 100's of photos and a many more clips.
 
                            Cons

The camera does not have a fast shutter speed, which means it's not the greatest at action shots. The camera also does it give you much control over many of the settings focus and shutter speed. The camera is also pretty thick for being so small. I also wish it had a few more buttons on the outside, rather in the menus.

                           Conclusion

However, in the end the menus are simple and easy to use. This is great camera, at a great price, for someone who just wants to point and shot (not having to mess with technical settings). 

P.S. I have dropped this camera a few times, gave it some pretty deep scratches, and it still works great!
