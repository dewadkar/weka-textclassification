            Alright--  This is my 2nd SAAB, i also have a 1996 SAAB 900s, without the turbo,which can be sluggish, but my new 2002 9-3 is off the hook like a cordless phone!
Features of the SAAB:
- Great looks, looks like nothing else on the road
- Great trunk space, more than a CR-V or RAV 4 and tons more than other sedans
- Good acceleration
- Great gas mileage
- ABS brakes that could stop on a nickel
Amenities:
- The car comes standard with many things that would be extra on others such as, heated seats, keyless entry, front AND rear fog lights, awesome computer controls on the dash, ON-star (300 bucks a month though)and many other features

Cons:
- The car is a great upgrade from the 900 series in the 90's, because TURBO is standard now and the thing moves
-People say Saab's are in the shop alot, but its just how you treat them, and the new ones are made a lot better.
-No cupholders, or at least ones you could use without hitting the guardrail

Overall, Saabs are different looking, fast cars with great features, and are now more reliable than ever.  One problem is that the resale value on these things suck, but hey lease one and you get a great deal.  The things will last forever, and if you treat it right, it will treat you like royalty in singapore.  I would definatly recommend it for the value, and overall the looks!
