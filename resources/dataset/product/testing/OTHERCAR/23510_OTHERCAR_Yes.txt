            My Audi S4:
I have to admit that I waited for this car much too long, and in the end, the hard choice was picking a color.  The little swatches on the brochure really don't do a good job of how elegant and sophisticated this car looks in any color.
My first choice was the Imola Yellow or the Nogaro Blue.  Then I decided that these would probably be a bit too flashy!  So I decided to go with the basic beautiful Light Silver Metallic.  When I was in Colorado, I saw an S4 in the Casablanca White, and I fell in love all over again, even though my S4 was already 3 months old.  In my parking lot here in Boston, I come face to face with a Brilliant Black, and it makes me wonder, what if...Parked right outside my door, I can usually find a Laser Red or Santorin Blue parked on the weekends.  I fell surrounded by greatness, and reminders of the difficult choice it was to choose the color of one of my greatest purchases ever.
As I was saying, mine is the Light Silver Metallic.  I chose the Onyx leather - Silver Alcantara interior to complement the and set this car apart from others.  It really was the ultimate choice. As I waited for mine, another had become available with the Onyx leather interior, and my heart ached as I had to pass on it to another bright eyed soon to be owner. So I waited, a few more weeks, and then &quot;she&quot; arrived.
I did not call in sick to pick &quot;her&quot; up.  I took on an immediate vacation, about 3 days not counting the weekend.
Now it has been just about 8 months, and when I get in and turn the key, it speaks to me, and I take &quot;her&quot; for a ride.
Okay...and now about the car, really!
Regardless of what color you pick, the S4 is able to remind you everyday why you've picked this car over any other.  I think that for the ammenities it provides, including its beast like power, it is quite a steal.  I was more then happy to bring to the dealership a check that was worth as much as half of the car's price.  Every single thing in the car was well thought out.  Every knob, every cranny, and every detail was not left unturned.
The steering wheel is just thick enough that you love to grab on to it, and wish you did not have to let go of it when you go to work.  The Triptonic gearbox is just what the doctor ordered.  Living in the city, sometimes is great to have the optional automatic.  Some of you know what I mean.  Plus, with so much power, I can say that I don't look back passing on the manual transmission.  This is an option that they don't charge extra for, and that is good.  You choose your poison.
The sound system is just marvelous.  Anything from Techno to Easy Listening, and regardless of your mood, you will be glad you got what it takes.  The heating/air conditioning system is just amazing.  You should not pass on the heated seats option if you live on a cold climate.
All passengers up front and in the back are quite comfortable.  It sits 4 best, but could sit 5 without much problems.  During the Summer I installed a bike rack for 2 mountain bikes, and it was the easiest thing to install and uninstall.  What a great addition to an already well rounded car.  Trunk space, what can I say, I think I can fit a Boeing 747 in it.  Just kidding there, but it is quite large in there.  I have been able to put 2 average size adults in it, just for trying.  The folding 60/40 split rear seats is another great advantage.  When I test drove a BMW 328i, I had to pay extra for this option.  Actually, when I tried to match the same options on a BMW 328i with my Audi's S4, without the Quattro option, the BMW was about the same price, with less power.  But I have nothing bad to say about Bimmers...I own a 1997 540i that could be another great &quot;epinion&quot; on itself!
The engine bay is well filled.  All 250 horses fit up front without any problems.  They just keep asking you to allow them to show you what they're made of.  
One thing I would like to comment on also is the Silver Alcantara inserts.  These are just great.  I was a bit afraid at first, in thinking that they would get dirty easily.  But of course, with just a bit more of care then normal, I have had no issues at all.  Even when I went to my S4's 6 month check up, which &quot;she&quot; passed with flying colors, they took very good care of my seats.  The Alcantara is like suede.  It helps keep you planted on your seat when you do those harsh 90 degree turns at high speeds.  Not that I do them often, mind you!
During the 6 month check up, I asked the crew to take a look at the windshield sprays.  The one on the drivers side hits the wiper when it is in its default parked position.  They played with it, and so have I.  I think that because of where they are located, and the angle of the windshield, it must be a small design flaw, and one I can live with.
Gas consumption is not like a Honda Civic, but it is not like a Ford Excursion either.  If do normal to mild pushing, you should get about 23 to 24 miles per gallon.
This is a highly recommended buy for the $40K range type of car folks.  Even though it is a sedan, you won't know it, until you decide to take your friends around town, and you don't have to flip your seat forward to let the rest of the crown join you for the trip.
Visibility is great, and make sure to test various positions on both side mirrors.  There is a certain position where it actually minimizes those awful blind spots. But then again, it may be that no one will catch you, so you will always have room to move from lane to lane!
Happy cruising from Boston! <br><br>
