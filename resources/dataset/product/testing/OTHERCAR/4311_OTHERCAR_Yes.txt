            When I came home from college at the end of last April, I decided I needed a car.  After a couple days of searching the classifieds, I checked a couple of cars out.  I still hadn't made up my mind what I wanted, but after seeing this '94 Corolla, I decided to pursue it more.  

(I'll admit right now that my family is prejudiced towards Toyota.  My parents, two of my sisters, and myself all own Corollas).  

My mechanic checked the car out and found it in excellent condition, and gave me the go-ahead.  With 111,000 miles on it, I felt the asking price of $4500 was very reasonable, considering it is a Toyota, and bound to be a reliable car.  The 5-speed manual transmission is super-peppy, and the suspension is excellent.  

To date, after putting 5,000 more miles on it, I have yet to do more than give it an oil change, and a couple of quick car washes.  The gas mileage is admirable, at nearly 35 mpg (highway), about (31 mpg in the city).  Ironically, the fact that this car does so well in fuel economy makes me extremely happy when I see the price of gasoline go up!  I laugh at my friend's driving SUV's.   Here in Michigan, where gas hovered at $2.09/gallon (87 octane) for several weeks, the Corolla is definitely a worthwhile car to own. 

The factory radio w/ cassette is very nice, and the 4-speaker system is loud enough to satisfy my desire for loud &quot;rock 'n roll&quot; music.  The seats are comfortable and well-suited for prolonged driving, and the knobs and controls for everything are logically placed and easy to reach.  The trunk is decently sized, and I love the quick trunk/gas cap releases on the side of the driver's seat.  

My two main qualms with this car are that the passenger's side visor did not come with a mirror (just a minor quirk), and that the steering on this car is not as responsive as compared with my previous car (a '90 Corolla).  I'm not sure why the steering feels a little sluggish, but it's only a minor annoyance.  

In general, this car is a great car, dependable, reliable, and fun to drive.  In my opinion, go with the manual transmission and have fun!  The cost is right, and the quality is there, so invest in something you won't regret.   <br><br>
