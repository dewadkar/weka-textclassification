            I've been a Chevy fan all my life and there are plenty of reasons for that!  After I thought I would never like any other body style then that of my 1999 1500, I truly fell in love with the 2000 body.  With a better suspension and slightly smaller engine, I find that my gas mileage is slightly better and the truck drives much smoother and handles great. Although the 2000 model doesn't have the standard 350 small block, I don't feel a loss of power at all. Chevy continues to improve the durability of their trucks.  Everything seems to be put together much more solid...from the sound of the hood slamming to the closing of the driver and passenger doors.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the performance and look of the new Silverado!  Keep up the good work Chevy!<br><br>
