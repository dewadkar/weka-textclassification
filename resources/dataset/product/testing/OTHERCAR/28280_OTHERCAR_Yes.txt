            With its big-rig look, the Durango always looks ready, whether it's heading down a primitive road or parked at the shopping center. Based on the Dodge Dakota pickup, the Durango is bigger than the Ford Explorer, but not as big as the Ford Expedition or Chevy Tahoe. So if you're different and have an attitude, then you might find the Durango just right.

Three engines are available: 5.2-liter V8, 5.9-liter V8 and, new for 1999, a 3.9-liter V6

A part-time four-wheel-drive transfer case is standard. Shifting into part-time four-wheel drive is only appropriate for mud, snow and other low-traction situations; it's unsuitable for dry pavement as there is no slippage between the front and rear wheels and the tires will hop and chatter in tight parking lot maneuvers. It's a good setup for people who live in a dry climate, but want to be able to shift into ultimate off-road mode. I personally have a Jeep and it has the same system and I love it because it is not always slippery every day of the year. As sport-utilities go, the Durango is fun to drive. I spent a week with the big 5.9-liter Magnum V8 in the Wyoming area. It always feels willing to get down the road quickly with excellent throttle response and quick acceleration. 

Overall while it may compare with other SUVs, it certainly doesn't look like them. Dodge Durango makes a statement. I think it's a bold, attractive statement. I think Dodge succeeded at its goal of producing a smarter SUV. The Durango is intelligently designed and easy to operate. And it's a smart choice for people who want to step out from the crowd.
