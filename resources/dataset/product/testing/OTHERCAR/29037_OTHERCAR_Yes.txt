            The 1997 (and 2000) Honda CRV four wheel drive vehicle gives you a pleasant driving experience.  It is excellent for an everday vehicle.  It has plenty of get up and go.  It has ample leg and head  room in both the front and back seats.  I am over six foot tall and am able to sit comfortable in the back seat.  I live in Illinois.  Last year in December and January, we had 8 to 10 inches of snow.  I was never stuck.  I drove many comparable automobiles.  The Honda CRV had the most vehicle for the price.  When I first inquired about the vehicle, I thought there was no way I could afford the sticker price.  I was in reverse sticker shock when I discovered you can purchase it new for less than $20,000.  I hope to purchase another one soon.  I have heard that the new models have 26 more horsepower.

Well, we liked the 1997 so much, we purchased a new one.  We drove a 5 speed.  It drove out nicely.  But, we decided to go with the automatic. The 2000 has a lot more horsepower.  We recently drove it on the interstate.  There is a noticeable difference.  It also has a built in stereo and cd player.  And, the keyless entry is definitely a plus!

Again, I strongly recommend this vehicle.  Any drivers will enjoy it.<br><br>
