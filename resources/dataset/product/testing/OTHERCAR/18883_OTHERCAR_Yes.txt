            I got my base model 91 Eclipse just over a month ago, with 84k miles on it, and I love this car! It gets pretty good gas mileage, runs great, and handles any and all turns with ease. It's by far the smoothest ride I've ever experienced, and even at speeds in excess of 120 mph, it feels like only 65. I've put some money into mine already to beef up the horsepower, but the stock 92 horses isn't too bad considering the weight. This car has the best stock handling I've ever experienced. I've been driving my Eclipse really hard since I got it, as I like to race street and drag, and I've thrown on a cool air intake and am getting a 2.25" exhaust system to increase air flow from the stock 1 7/8", which should free up about another 5-10 horsepower. These engines can take a beating from what I've heard and from what I've done to mine already! I love this car, and would only give it up for another 91 with a 2.0L 4g63 engine. For anyone who ever said that this car is a lemon, I don't know if they made some differently, but mine has been raced and pushed to the limits, and it's perfectly fine. Mine tops out at 127mph right now, clocked at 145, but the 8valve SOHC makes it a little weaker than the 2.0L models that can hit 145 with some tweaking.
