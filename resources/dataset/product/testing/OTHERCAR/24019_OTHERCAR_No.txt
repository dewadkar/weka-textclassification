            Subaru Impreza-Brighton Sport Wagon 2003

Impressing, Maybe?

During a recent trip to Buffalo, I sold a vehicle I would drive when I went there for business. Having sold all my properties there, I knew I would not have to return as often as I used to so I decided to sell my car. 

I had plan to stay in Buffalo for about two and a half-week, I did not know if I would have enough time to sell the car. To my surprise it was gone within a few days after my arrival. Since I did not want to continuously bother friends or relatives for a ride, I decided to rent a car for the remaining of my stay.

This time I selected a local car rental place instead of the regular like Avis or National. I wanted to be able to rent an automobile that you do not usually have access to when you rent from the major outlets.

The selection was a limited but there was a Subaru Brighton Sport Wagon available, so I decided to give it a go.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

I found out that the Impreza line of Subaru automobiles offers something for just about any style one may want to drive and the price could vary by almost $9,000.00 between them.

The Brighton Sport Wagon is at the lower end of the price scale, then you have the TS Sedan, the Outback Wagon, the RS Coupe models and the more expensive RS Sedan.

A stronger engine than the other models powers the RS Coupe and Sedan. It is a Subaru Phase II 2.5 liter engine developing 165 horsepower. They will also have standard front and rear disc brakes and a sportier look with front and rear spoilers. But aside from this they basically the same.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The inside cabin of the Brighton Sport wagon is very simple. It is comfortable but not something to shout about. I am medium built adult and I found a bit cramped-in, so for any large body adults it may be a little un-comfortable.

The car I rented did have a tilt steering wheel and I made it easier to enter and exit the cabin. The seats were comfortable enough and all controls and gauges were easy to see and reach.

The all around view from the driver&#146s seat is excellent; I have to say that it is a very easy car to drive around within a city limit.

The rear seat area has enough heads and legroom for medium size built adults. The cargo space available is 62 cubic feet. 

The Brighton Sport Wagon I rented came with an AM/FM cassette radio, power mirrors and rear window defroster. All this equipment is standard on the Brighton.

The exterior:

The exterior of the Sport Wagon is very simple; it did have an optional luggage rack on it. Not that I needed it but I could see that it could be a useful accessory for a rental car.

As for all Subaru's the Brighton is powered by a full-time all-wheel drive power train.

The side-view mirrors are well located and will give a minimal blind spot.

THE ROAD TEST

As I mentioned above driving this rental car in the city was ok. It handled very well around tight spots and was very easy to park. 

Once on the road the ride is not as comfortable, it is not the kind of automobile I would go on a very long road trip in.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Subaru Impreza-Brighton Sport wagon I rented was equipped in this manner:

Engine: A 2.2 liters 4-cylinder boxer developing 142 horsepower.
Transmission: 5-speed manual.
Brakes: Front discs and rear drums.
Tires: 195/60R15
Safety: Driver and passenger&#146s airbags plus child safety locks.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

Well I rented one; I will not do it again unless I have to. It is not a bad car; it may be an excellent one for a young family just starting but I my age I am looking for a little more comfort.
