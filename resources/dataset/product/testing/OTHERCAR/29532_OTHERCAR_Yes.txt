            Although I only purchased this camera days ago, I am impressed.  The Kodak DC240 is functional for even the beginner photographer, yet has features like the adjustable exposure compensation that make the camera useful for those who desire higher quality pictures.  The LCD screen options are easy to understand and use.  Like most digital cameras, it goes through batteries quickly, but the recharger provided makes this a reasonable obstacle.  With a USB connection, downloading pictures takes less than 10 seconds a frame.  This digital camera is the best value for its features (3X optical zoom, 1.3 million pixel resolution.)  Furthermore, the Kodak website and information is helpful should one encounter problems, although this is unlikely because the camera is so user friendly.  <br><br>
