                Years ago I purchased a 1993 Miata new because I always wanted a sports car, and the price was right.  I have never been so happy with a car since.  It has proven very reliable over the years, even when parked outside exposed to the elements of St. Louis with its greatly varying weather.  After many years it has only had a few, easy to repair rattles.

    In terms of performance it is lower in power and speed than the more expensive BMW Z3, the Honda S2000, and other similar cars, but it has never disappointed me wether it be taking a sharp turn on a country road, or flooring it on that short highway ramp.  Even after many years of service the performance is still as good as it was the day I drove it off the dealer's lot.  

    In a couple years I do plan to sell this miata in exchange for, yes, another new miata.  The only reason I can think of to buy any other car is the need for more than 2 seats and more than a small trunk.<br><br>
