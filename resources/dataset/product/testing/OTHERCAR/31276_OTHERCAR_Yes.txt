            The very first car I drove was a 1983 Toyota Tercel. It was a rust orange color and sounded like a little sewing machine. 
The Toyota was excellent on gas, and that means GOOD! I could ride on 5 dollars worth of gas for a week. That's great gas mileage, when you consider the fact that I have 3 daughters that have places they MUST and need to go!My Mother was driving this Tercel and making payments on it. She was going to trade it in but instead I took up the remainder of the balance she owed and then Lucy became mine. 
She was stolen from the parking lot of my place of employment once! The police called me next morning saying that they had found her and had her towed at MY expense. I should have known that the thieves only wanted the killer PIONEER stereo system that was inside. But that was okay because all I wanted at the time was my Tercel back!
I sold her to my sister and her family a few months back. She has had minor work done on her and shes a little worn on inside, but she is a heck of a car. I recommend the TOYOTA TERCEL to anyone that would appreciate a fine running small car. I would buy her all over again!<br><br>
