            I have been researching this vehicle for about 4 months and liked what I found.  It may be small, but it doesn't feel, look or act small.  There is more actual room in it than I had in my Jeep Cherokee.  It is stable, turns sharp (for all the small parking spaces) and will seat 4 adults and a 2 year old in a car seat.  So far, I am impressed with it.  I have told all my friends (with and without kids) that this is a vehicle that will suit their personalities AND let them be parents at the same time.  This is a fun car with a lot of personality and style.<br><br>
