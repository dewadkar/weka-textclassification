            A friend of mine got a 1995 Mazda Protege LX for Christmas in 1994. It was an excellent car all-in-all. The factory sound system was top notch, the interior room was incredible, and the finish quality was extraordinary. 

I am not sure what they paid for it, but I think it was around 15,000, about what you would expect to pay for a similarly equipped Honda. The car came equipped with A/C, automatic, power windows and door locks, CD player, and a host of other options for driving convenience. The best thing I can say about this car is how well it handled in inclement weather. There simply was no stopping this car in snow. Once, we were trapped in a sudden snowstorm, with other cars stranded all around us, and the Mazda pulled us right through it. My friends dad actually preferred the Protege to their Lexus ES300.

On the downside, the engine needed more power. The brakes were in constant need of replacement, and the throttle control needed replaced twice while she owned the car. 

I speak of the Protege in the past tense, because it is no longer with her. In September of 1998, as I drove it to her house, I was hit head on by a passing truck. The airbags deployed, the front end crumpled, the engine dropped to the pavement. But I walked away relatively unhurt---kudos to Mazda's safety engineers. The car had first-generation airbags, and while I can't say what injuries I might have sustained without them, they did deploy with such force that my arm was blown off the steering wheel and right through the windshield. (Ouch!  Broken elbows hurt!)
