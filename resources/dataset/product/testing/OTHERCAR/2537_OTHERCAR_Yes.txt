            I leased the 1999 Montana in all silver and I have to tell you I am very pleased with this van. It's been a year and a half and here's my story.

Not everything about this van is perfect but the problems are really only minor.

Features:  The absolute best thing about this van is the power sliding door.  It is a show stopper, everyone thinks it's just the coolest thing.  It's nice that all the doors lock when you put the car in drive, and the lights turn on and off automatically at night.  The fog lights make the car look aggressive, not wimpy. The rear seats fold forward and individually, so you don't actually have to take them out to gain a ton of room for luggage.  It has independent heat/AC controls accessible to the center passengers.

Power: I also own a Z28 with an LT1 V8, which has awesome power.  Of course the Montana is no Z28, but, it does has terrific power off the line, and it handles like a car.  I have driven this van at 70 mph in heavy rainstorms and have felt very confident driving (the handling and steering response allowed this).  The view of the road is vast. 

Looks:  Only the Dodge Caravan will come close to the wonderful looks of the Montana, but the full length, heavy side moldings put the Montana on top. Don't select the two-tone models; they tend to make the Montana look cheap.  I have the all-silver color, and that really makes this van look sharp!  

Problems: Well they are minor, but annoying.  Within a month the air bag light sensor had to be replaced.  They didnï¿½t give me a loaner car so I had my wife follow me with the other car (no loaner car really bothered me).
The left fog light blew out twice within 1 year.  The power door would refuse to close.  Just as it slid closed, it would decide to slide back open. After pressing the remote button several times, it would finally close.  This problem only delayed me about 3 mins, and had happened only about 6 times randomly.  It's been a while since it has happened again though.  The rear door is difficult to handle, it opens awkwardly.  Only the passenger door is power, which is a downer. Also, the center row passengers cannot control the dome light, which is very, very annoying.  

As soon as my lease is up I plan to buy another Montana, this time I will get the features which I skimped out on (and regret).  Like the Dual Power sliding doors, Dual Stereo systems, Flat screen TV with VCR (maybe DVD by then), all-wheel drive, and leather seats. 

I have no kids! But I tell you, I can have 4 couples out for a night in NYC and it is just so much fun to have everyone together as opposed to taking 2 or sometimes 3 cars!  Yeah they laugh at first, but once the night is over everyone just loves that van!
