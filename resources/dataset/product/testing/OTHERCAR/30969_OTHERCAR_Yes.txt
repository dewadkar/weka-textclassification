            Purchased a 2000 Astro cargo van with two seats, a/c, rear windows and side window.... very pleased with it.... not full size load capacity but certainly ample for our needs and also fits nicely into the garage. Like the large capacity gas tank but not the poor gas mileage. Lots of power and handles well, not too tippy and easy to drive.... if this comment seems sexist, i'm sorry.... but my wife felt that this was the best size suited for her business needs and ease of driving. She tried the full sized vans and was not comfortable with them, and she is no shrinking driver let me tell you. She has driven sports cars, we have the speeding tickets to prove it, so she knows how to handle cars. 

It has been trouble free so far with 35,000 km ( 20,000 + miles for my American friends), and it is a comfortable ride for a cargo van. Since I am almost 6'3" tall I was worried about the tight footwell space in the front for the driver, but was surprised that I easily adjusted to it, and even 6 hours trips were not a problem. I have found the seats surprisingly comfortable.

I enjoy the obvious high driving position that a van provides, and it is certainly easy to maneuver around for parking or in congested city streets. And it cruises easily on highways.

I was also pleased with the reasonable purchase price .... thought it was a very good value for a well put together van.
