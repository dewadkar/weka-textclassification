            I must say out of all of the full size trucks the dodge 1500 out performs all of the competitors.  I purchased mine in November 1997 and it was one of the first 1,000 manufactured.  I've only had it a little over 2 years, but driven over 48,000 miles so far.  

Places driven:
I purchased the truck in California and shortly after I started my first road trip through Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and stopped in Texas.
I lived in it for a week while I was up in Cape Cod, MA and could have comfortably taken another person along.
If it weren't for having such a reliable truck I couldn't have produced so much photography this previous year.  Unlike the previous vehicles I've owned after 20+ hours of driving I can still feel my legs.
This truck has gone through 20 of the states in the U.S. and I have a few more planned before I turn this one in for a new one.

Comparison:
If I could relate this truck to anything I'd say it's similar to driving most full size luxury cars except for the security of feeling safe.

I must admit that the price tag is a little steep, but well worth the investment.

Specs:
5.9L V8, club cab, chrome package, camper shell, 4,500 lbs of love.<br><br>
