            I love this camera! It takes beautiful images for a 3.3 megapixel. The 1.8f lens is unbeatable, especially for indoor shots. I've had several digital cameras before & the Olympus has always come out on top. The screen is easy to see outdoors due to the anti-glare coating, the unit is well put together & the camera has a very traditional layout. I liked mine so much I went out & bought another for my dad to use. He no longer touches his 35mm camera! Neither do I for that matter. This is the first real replacement camera I've had & don't expect to part with it anytime soon!
