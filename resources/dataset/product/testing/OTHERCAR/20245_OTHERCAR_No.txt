            Is it a good investment? Overall I think it was well worth the $20,000 that we paid for it. The one we bought was fully equipped with leather interior which we love, its easy to care for and looks great as well as comfortable. It also has a sunroof which in Iowa we don't seem to have a lot of use for. The color is another consideration when buying a new vehicle, and lighter is better. We bought a dark blue one which looks good for about two days after being washed then it looks dirty. Out on the road this car is very fun to drive. It is very smooth running and handles corners with ease. I would definitely recommend this car to anyone with out a large family. It has plenty of trunk space for those shopping trips we all love, but the interior isn't quit as roomy as I expected. There is four people in my family and we are all on the large size and there's just not the space inside that we expected. As for the in-dash stereo, with CD, its almost a must with teenagers. Overall we are very pleased, although keep your mini van for those long trips with children, or the trip will be a VERY LONG---one.
