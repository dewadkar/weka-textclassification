            I have had my V-6 Accord LE for several months now. The car continues to impress me and is a joy to drive.  So why the V-6 for all that extra money?  Well with 200 horsepower the engine idles smooth and quiet, barely whispers at highway speeds and still got 26 miles per gallon in mixed driving on my last tank of gas. Both the interior and exterior fit and finish are excellent.  

Driving Impressions:

The V-6 gets you out in traffic as fast as you could possibly need and when you come to your first bend in the road you will be amazed how connected you feel in a car this size.  The car corners just the way you need it to, it goes where you want and feels great doing it.  From the road feel to the seat feel it's all solid and sure.

On The Inside:

Safety features are all up to date including the side air bags and 4-wheel anti-lock brakes.  The stereo/cd system is crisp and clear an added bonus is radio reception which locks onto stations better than any I have ever used.  The controls are where you want them and they are very easy to operate.

On The Outside:

The car is kind of plain not even an antenna on the outside because it's in the rear window glass.  Some say plain I say refined.  This car does not look like a pizza with everything, no wild paint schemes and you can not fix your hair in the reflection of mirror chrome wheels.  Refined, grown up and classy best describe the look of the 2000 accord.

Value:

The LE with the V-6 offers a lot of car with a great reputation without the big dollar upgrades that EX adds.  The EX gives you a power moonroof, leather seats, and a few other gadgets.  If you can absorb the extra $2,500 for the EX it is a fine choice as well.  Taller drivers will want to check the reduced headroom resulting from the power moonroof in the EX.  

This car has made Car and Driver's ten best again this year and it is no accident.  You are going to love this car.<br><br>
