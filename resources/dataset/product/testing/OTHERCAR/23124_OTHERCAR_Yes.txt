              The Dodge Stratus is an excellent car for the price.  We own a 1998 model in white.  I love to look out and see that car and know that it is the one that I travel in daily.  
  For a car that was around $12,000, it's fully loaded.  It features tilt wheel, cruise, air conditioning, AM/FM Cassette player with stereo surround speaker system, theater lighting, basically everything except a CD player, power locks, or power windows.  There is even an anti-theft deterrant trunk latch.  
  The car has a very roomy interior, yet remains sporty in it's own way. The back seat folds down for extra room and the back seats themselves are very comfortable, as compared to many new models which always issue a back ache to the traveller.  
  The safety features on this automobile provide a little extra peace of mind at any given time.  Dual airbags are present, as are child safety locks on both rear doors.  Anti-lock braking systems are also in place.
  For the money that was paid for this car, I truly expected junk.  Other than a few minor glitches, I have been extremely pleased.  In the few months that it has been in our possession, it has provided sheer comfort on long drives.  I would highly recommend it to anyone on the market for a new car.  It goes above and beyond the call of duty for its vehicle class.<br><br>
