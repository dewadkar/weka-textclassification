              Acura's Integra Coupe is undoubtedly one of the best sport cars on the market.  There are numerous aspects about the car that are either &quot;Love 'em or Leave 'em.&quot;  But, overall, the car is still kicking it with the best of them on the market as of date.
  All one has to do is drive this sporty little coupe to instantly fall in love with it!  The way it corners (suctioning to the road), to the way it races down the streets of any street, the driver will immediately recognize the strengths that this trendy little car offer.  The interior is roomy enough for the driver and front passenger and the Integra's customizable options are enough to excite anyone.
  However, the only real disappointment with the car is that somewhat outdated body style.  Apparently Acura is planning on changing this in the coming years so we may not have to wait too much longer for a trendier exterior to match it's interior!  The only other complaint is the lack of room for back-seat passengers, but I suppose that's why they are only a &quot;sport coupe.&quot;
  Overall, this is an incredible car that anyone would be fortunate to own!<br><br>
