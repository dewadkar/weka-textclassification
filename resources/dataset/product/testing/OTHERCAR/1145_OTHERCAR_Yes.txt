              The 2000 Dodge Neon is a lot like the old Neon�only it's all grown up. The new version of this front-wheel-drive model looks sleeker and is stronger, quieter and more refined. 
  Styling is reminiscent of the old model's, but the new one looks considerably sportier and is 2.6 inches longer overall and slightly wider. Wave good bye to the "smiling face" grille and cheap interior materials that the last Neon had. Another change is the marginal-looking old dashboard, replaced by one that looks as if it were from a larger, more upscale DaimlerChrysler sedan. 
   The 2000 Neon also is more solid. For instance, there now are full-frame, triple-sealed doors that do away with such things as wind leaks common with the old front doors, which had the "wiggle windows" that vibrated when a door was slammed. 
   The price was right,  but the old Neon had to go. After almost 6 years on the market (introduced in Jan. 94) and a good run with more than 1.5 million sold, the Neon didn't look so new anymore.  It was cute, cheap and fun to drive. But was too noisy and unrefined to appeal to aging Generation Xers�who were major buyers early on. 
   The new Neon is costlier, but worth it.  Kiss the $10,000 priced Neon and the Neon coupe goodbye, both are gone. The new Neon comes only as a 4-door sedan with had a $12,390 base price when it was introduced. And popular options easily can cause the bottom line to swell to more than $16,000�even after factory option discounts. 
   For the 2000, the 150-horsepower performance model also has been dumped, but a new one is scheduled to arrive as a 2001 model. 
   The only engine offered is the familiar 2.0-liter 132-horsepower four cylinder, though it's been tuned to be more responsive. The single-overhead-camshaft 16-valve motor doesn't isn't as loud as it was when pushed, but still is fairly noisy under hard acceleration. 
  But considering the gas prices, the Neon is your car.  It is still considerably light and  gets an estimated 25 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway with the automatic and 28 and 35 with the manual. 
   Like the old Neon, the new model is fun to drive and is still roomy for it's size. It's not as refined as some Japanese rivals such as the Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra, but it's got more style than those competitors and most of the rough edges are have been smoothed over.
