            For years I asked my husband for a mini van but it seems like every time we looked at them there was something he didn't like...until we discovered the Toyota Sienna!  

The Sienna was rated the Highest in Safety!  This was a big factor for us.  Another big factor, it wasn't "cheaply" made...several of our friends had bought minivans but they just weren't made as well as our Sienna, in theirs the window handles, gearshifts, etc. just looked cheap.  The Sienna has very solid door handles, dash buttons, window controls, etc.   

From a Mom's point of view (I can't tell you the specifics except it's a V6 engine) the van drives much like a car, very easy to park   and definetely has good exceleration!  I also enjoy the convience of having two side doors so the kids can load up from either side.  One of them is a power door, the other is not.  The power door is great for my 1st grader who isn't so big!  He simply lifts the door handle up and the door slides open by itself.  Or Mom can push the "door" button on the remote and it will open for him...here lies are only problem with the van, the door opens too easily with the remote and often I have returned to the van and find the door has been open for hours!  I have since learned if I lock the doors when I get out that the door can not open if locked.  

This van has a lot of extra features...my kids favorite is the 8 cup holders located thru out the van.  The van has rear heat/ac which is a must have for us so no one gets sick in the back.  I am prone to getting car sick and with rear air I don't have any problems when I sit in the back.    We also have the sunroof in our van.  I like to leave it open and it feels very roomy with a view of the sky overhead.  We have never had problems with the sunroof leaking or getting stuck, etc.  Our van has leather seats...they clean up very easily and look new still!  The only downside to leather, it's very cold when you first get in during the winter (we live in North Dakota).  North Dakota brings us to the point of snow/ice driving...the van is front wheel drive and has antilock brakes.  It handles very well in the snow, the only exception is when we get over 12" then clearance is a factor.  The antilocks kick in on ice and the van stops well.

The Sienna is supposed to seat 7 however we have found that the back seat does not comfortable sit 3 adults  - kids are fine.  The captains chairs in the middle row are very comfortable for adults.

We feel for the size of the minivan that the Sienna gets good mileage!  We get around 19 when we run short errands and 25 on the highway.  

We are very happy with our Sienna and recommend it to anyone who asks.  We were lucky and found a used one but wondered why it was sold and found out the couple bought a brand new Sienna!
