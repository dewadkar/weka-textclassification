            The All-New 2000 Chevy Tahoe has underwent many changes, and it is my opinion the Chevy made this TAHOE the best ever. The new features such as the redesigned front end, the new suspension in the rear end, and the general design has really, made this truck Look GREAT and Drive outstanding. The feature I don't care for is the third seat. There really isn't that much room, for it in the back. That really is my only complaint about it. Everything else is great. From the lights in the mirrors to illuminate the ground at night, to the automatic headlights, it is truly a OUTSTANDING truck. I would recommend it to all the inquire about it.
