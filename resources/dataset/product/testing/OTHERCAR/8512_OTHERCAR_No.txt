            After being given a 1995 Cutlass Ciera, it was used as a daily driver/beater.  It did not stand the test of time.  In the year I have had it, the following things have occurred:

Turn signal stopped working
Cigarette lighter died
Cigarette lighter fell out
Head Gasket Blew
Thermostat froze
Radiator plugged up
all 4 struts were shot
Rear passenger door power lock stopped working
Driver side power window stopped working
The front bumper fell off(nothing had hit it)

The car only had 77,000 miles on it at this point.  I find that much repair work to be excessive.  Not to mention the rust that formed on the doors and rear quarter panels.  The gas mileage on this car never lived up to its 24MPG that GM stated.  The car was lucky to see 20MPG.  

There are redeeming sides to the car.  The front bench seat is roomy.  It could fit three, but not comfortably.  It was very easy to drill through the front bumper to secure it using a screw.    

After nearly $3000 sunk into this car, I am glad to be rid of it.
