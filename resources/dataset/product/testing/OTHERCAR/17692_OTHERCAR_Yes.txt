            Yup.  What you have heard is true.  The Saturn line really is that good.  We needed a new car and started looking at Hondas, but soon discovered that we could get a new 2000 Saturn for what a 1997 Honda Accord cost.  You do the math.

So we test drove a 2000 Saturn SL2 and bought it two days later.  These little cars are something else.  I always saw them on the road and thought &quot;They look too small...&quot; but there is a surprising amount of room
in the passenger compartment.  I'm 6 feet tall, and I can fit behind the wheel comfortably and there is still room in the back seats for others - they don't have the sardine can action present in most small American cars.

We decided to buy the SL2 model Saturn for one reason:  This is the only S-series model that has the DOHC engine (124 HP) vs. the 100 HP the normal SL1 and SL model engine puts out.  The SL2 also comes with air conditioning standard.  The SL and SL1 are somewhat cheaper, but having that extra power is definitely worth it.  Drive both and you will most likely agree.

The buying experience was just like you have heard:  The salesmen are not commissioned, and so there are no high-pressure tactics.  Our salesman was courteous, professional, and knowledgeable about his product.  I had become so used to dealing with used car carnivore salesman that this was quite a refreshing change of pace.  Another perk of the Saturn experience.

Now, it is also true that the sales prices of the cars are not negotiable, but I almost feel that this allows the dealerships to create a false sense of &quot;savings&quot; by claming that you are getting the best deal.  I think in reality this really works out to help the dealerships, not the customer, but the prices are still very reasonable.

We ended up paying $15,100 for our SL2 with power locks, CD+tape player, and car alarm.  You can actually get a brand new model for a little over $13,500 if you can believe it.  In this day and age where car prices have somehow managed to grow to ungodly bloated levels for no obvious reasons,  it is nice to own a car that is a quality vehicle and is also reasonably priced.

So we have only had our Saturn for a month, but each and every day we drive it around we revel in our good fortune to have found and bought this car.  If you want info yourself, just go to the dealership and ask.  Normally, this would be a crazy maneuver, but the info is there without the unpleasant sales force looming over you like a hungry tornado.
