            it's june 21,2002 and i bought my 1995 saturn a month ago today.  my beloved 1988 corolla died in syracuse a little over a month ago... (yep, i'm in NJ... my fault it died.. that's another story).....

this car is simply the MOST bang for the buck.  i paid LESS THAN $2000 for a 1995 SL1... with a lot of miles on it... ok, 141,677 miles at time of purchase, to be exact.

in this past month i have put 1200 incredibly enjoyable miles on this car.  car has "its" (saturn's) classic good looks... and,... (1995 was the first year of  major interior rennovations... re: the dash, cupholders...etc...) and overall responsiveness... have made me incredibly happy... (95 was also the first year.. of INCREASING the horsepower.. from 85 to 100)

when shopping for a new,.... albeit USED car.. this car WON by a landslide over any other car on the market... started originally LQQKING for a replacement for my beloved corolla.. sighs.. best car i've ever owned.. but again, that's another story...

car runs great.. EVERYTHING works.. cruise control, AC, etc... only drawback.. is despite its overall size the amount of storage space is VERY limited... keep that in mind if you are LQQKING for one...

still, i am  very happy to have found a car... that is SERIOUS competition for the japanese models.. and?.... did more than a bit of research before deciding on the product.. if you do your homework.... you can find a car that is in great condition... one of the very few models that consumer reports recommends...(re: used amercan cars) and.. since MOST are not aware of what BARGAINS these cars are... you can get a REAL deal on one....i.e., for what i paid for THIS car... the best i could have done in a toyota,honda...etc.. was a 1992 model... and i am being generous here...re: more like a 1991 model.. than a 92..

i've done more than a bit of research of this vehicle.. and?.. bottom line.. i lucked out.. cause i've done some of it post-purchase.. 1995 is a FANTASTIC year.. for saturns.. from an interior perspective.. dual airbags.. center console... with an arm rest.. placed at JUST the right height. *(why they got rid of that in 1996, i'll never know)... 

engine is STRONG.. and yep... mine now has 143,000+ miles on it.... passed inspection.. NEW JERSEY .... with a minor glitch.. that is, i had to replace the GAS CAP...lol... seems it COULDN'T be pressurized... and NJ has one of the toughest state inspections.... re: emmissions...

would i buy this car again?.. (or another?) in a heartbeat.. and?... i would recommend.. both.. http://www.autotrader.com .... AND ebay... if you are LQQKING for one of these fine vehicles..

best of luck.. and i hope you have as happy a motoring experience.. as i am!!!....
