            My husband always shied away from the Lincoln Continental thinking it wasn't as roomy as the larger sized lincolns. He was proved wrong by the new 92 continental he just purchased. It's roomy interior seats 6 comfortably or one large size man. It has all the toys of the higher priced luxury cars but a much lower price tag. It drives great and handles like a baby. In fact, the only complaint is how low it is to the ground. But you feel like you're riding on air, none the less. It's sleek appearance just enhances it's overall appeal. I highly recommend this choice for luxury.<br><br>
