            After living with my WRX for more than a year, I'm scratching my head wondering why everyone doesn't own a Subaru product. Like many, I had always considered Subarus as fringe imports....different, which can be good, but perhaps too quirky in their nature and/or operation. I was wrong. I've owned many vehicles throughout the years..domestic, Asian, European...but my WRX is the first vehicle to endear itself to me in such a way to have virtually become a member of the family. It's truly like a Swiss Army knife of sorts which seems unstoppable regardless of what's thrown at it...be it nature's rage or other "muscular" machinery on the road. 

One thing I've really come to appreciate about "Scooby" is that he operates exactly the same everyday. This may sound like an odd statement, but the BMW 3 series he replaced was as temperamental as a goat, with varying idle speeds/smoothness, sounds, shift patterns, etc. With over 25,000 miles of aggressive driving on the odo, the WRX operates exactly the same as it did on day one. At idle, the tach needle doesn't flinch from it's position...it's that smooth. I've experienced not one hiccup along the way. 

At speed, the WRX cruises extremely well..stable, relatively quiet, confident. One can suddenly realize that he/she is exploring some heady speeds before realized...a radar detector is essential in this car. My only complaint regarding the car's interior, so to speak, is the marginal audio system. It's satisfactory, but if one likes a great deal of treble, the car's tweeters can certainly complain.

The car has not been difficult to service, materials are holding up well, trunk space is surprisingly accommodating. I do plan to replace the OEM tires soon...they've worn well but a more aggressive tire should certainly improve the car's actions.

Something I didn't realize would necessarily happen is the attention the car gets in traffic or parking lots...males tend to love it (at least those who can tell a hammer from a wrench). Still, the WRX (like Subarus in general) remain a mystery to many. Most people still don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about when you indicate what you drive. If only cars were sold "upside down" at dealerships...so people could really see what they were buying...and appreciate the inherent goodness of this product.
