            I don't need to get into Mercedes Benz reputation for quality.  I don't need to get into the over 130,000 dollar price tag, and I don't need to get into the 0-60 speed on this car.  But I don have one thing to say to start things off.

V12, yes, that's right V12, 12 cylinder engine of beauty makes this the most luxurious car to drive in the world.  The leather interior with built in cellular phone which is voice activated, seat warmers, adjustable everything, sunroof, legroom for days, and a six CD changer so you can listen to what you want, when you want on that unbelievably wonderful sound system which turns off as soon as you make or recieve a phone call.

The entire car is both literally and figuratively speaking a well-oiled machine, everything is working together in abosolute harmony.  Your foot steps on that gas pedal and the car goes... No need to accelerate, or wait for the transmission to get into gear, the second you hit that gas pedal with eve the lightest bit of force, the car goes.

Hit the brakes, the car stops.  No thinking about it, no slow screeching halt, the car stops on a dime.  But not in a jerky way, it smoothly stops dead in it's tracks.

The steering is almost ridiculous, the handling is phenomonal, if you point the car in a direction, it will go there.  THe turning radius is better than that of most sports cars.

And count your lucky stars if you are a passenger in this car because everything in the back seatsis adjustable as well, the seats have seat warmers, the seat backs move to suit yor favorite seating position, everything you could want and more.

This car is God's gift to the roads.  If you have the money, buy one.  If you don't have the money, pretend you do and test drive one. Being in this car is like floating on pavement.<br><br>
