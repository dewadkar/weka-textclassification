            I couldn't pass up the deal I got on this one and I've never regretted the purchase. The 2000 Z 71 (still the older body style) is a great vehicle for those who like the ruggedness of the suv and still want car-like amenities.  It comes standard with heated seats, 2-tone leather, brush guard, skid plates, special wheels, wheel moldings, special suspension,  running boards, and more. It handles and rides extremely well for an suv of it's size and seats a family of 5 comfortably and still has room for  your cargo.  I was attracted to it's overall look which has a more serious off-road appearance with its' monochromatic bumpers and molding.  I am 6'1&quot; and the seats are comfortable even in the back( I've actually ridden back there) We made a rather long trip immediately after we bought it and I did not suffer from driving fatigue as is sometimes the case. Obviously sitting up higher gives you a better view of the road which is one reason why the suv is so popular. I had to go to the shop once because of excessive wind noise. The dealer was able to improve that with a minor adjustment to the doors.
All in all I've been well pleased with the performance and I would highly recommend the Tahoe as I'm told the newer style offers even more improvements, if you can imagine that. In closing I would say that if you have never owned or driven a truck or suv that they are considerably different in ride/handling and it is unfair to compare those characteristics to that of a car. They are in a class by themselves... so to speak.<br><br>
