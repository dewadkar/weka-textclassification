            The 1999 Pontiac Grand Am GT sedan and coup are the performance versions of the revamped new Grand Am, which has slicker styling, roomier interior, longer wheelbase and stronger construction. The $19,070-$20,970 GT looks the part, with a racier front end, uplevel aluminum wheels and four big tailpipes. But the side body cladding has a washboard appearance and is overdone. Also, the rear spoiler has a tacked-on appearance and looks almost comical with its small vertical fins. The solid, well equipped GT offers a lot for the money. It looks awfully brash, but is fun to drive and easy to live with. The Grand Am has been a consistently strong seller, and the GT should help keep sales rolling well.
