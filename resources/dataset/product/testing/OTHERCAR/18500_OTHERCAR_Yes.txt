            What a fun car to drive!  I wanted a car under $30k that was fun to drive, reliable, safe, and had most of the convenience features found on more expensive luxury cars.  The 2002 Passat is it.  The GLX comes basically loaded.  The only options to add are 4Motion (essentially the Audi Quattro 4 wheel drive transmission), which also requires an automatic transmission.  The only other option is a dealer installed CD player.  (Kind of annoying that doesn't come standard though).

The car handles like a dream, especially in the snow & ice.  The day I picked mine up we got four inches of snow.  The 4Motion all-time all wheel drive kept the car on the road like it was on rails.  Better even than an SUV because the car sits lower to the ground so you don't have that "top heavy" feeling going around corners.

On dry pavement the 4Motion makes driving a whole new experience.  This car handles very well in tight turns under accelaration.  

The interior build quality is tight and lends itself to a good sports car feeling.  Dash lights are a stylish blue, with red needles and higlights.  It looks very cool.

Convenience features abound.  Power retracting, heated side mirrors, heated driver and passenger seats, universal remote built (into the sun visor), eight way power adjustable driver and passenger seats, three memory settings for driver seat & side mirrors, the passenger side mirror automatically tilts downward when put into reverse so you can see the curb (or you can disable this feature), Monsoon sound system provides very good sound quality, volume and tuning controls on the steering wheel, and of course leather throughout with wood trim.  There's actually many more "little things" that make it obvious the car is very well engineered.

The V6 engine puts out 190hp, which is adequate for most driving conditions.  Quick enough off the line to jump out in front of the pack if you need to, but it's not going to win any drag races.  At highway speeds the engine provides a quick and smooth response to any pressure on the gas pedal.  The Tiptronic transmission is a lot of fun and very smooth too.

All-in-all, I'm very satisfied with the car.  When shopping I considered the Maxima, Camry, a few Volvos, Mercedes under $35k, Lexus, and Honda.  The Passat is smaller than most of the cars I drove, but not by much, and certainly large enough for me.  I'm 6'2" and fit comfortably, with lots of head room.  I've had three other guys my size in the car and all passengers had ample leg and head room.

The Cons are minor:  Very limited internal storage space (the trunk is decent though), CD player is extra, the fuel tank holds only 16 gals., and the car gets pricey when you load it up with the 4Motion, but it's worth it in my opinion.

Finding a dealer that would move on price was a little tough.  Maybe because it was the onset of winter in Minnesota and I was looking for the 4Motion.  In the end I got the car for $30,400, plus tax and license (but including destination).  That's about $2k off sticker and didn't include a CD player.  After a week without a CD, I complained to the salesman, who gave me a decent deal on a CD player ($270 installed).
