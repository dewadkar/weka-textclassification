            Why waste your time looking at any other sports car when you can see for yourself what a HOT car the toyota celica is.  I have a used toyota celica that is a 91.  I have had it for 3 years now and I purchased it from the toyota dealer.  When I was there the salesman went on and on about how reliable and dependable they are.  But I was still not quite sure, so I asked around.  I talked to one of my mom's friend that has had one for 15 years and commutes more that 100 miles a day to work and back.  She said that her 1983 celica has over 500,000 miles on it and it has been great.  That is what sold me.  So if your in the market for a good, reliable car that will last a long time, go out and purchase a toyota celica today!<br><br>
