            The s10 is a good basic function digital camera.  I have used a Kodak, Casio, Sony and Fuji, but none of them were as easy as the s10.  The picture quality is top-notch with very good automatic exposure settings.  There are available option for controlling flash, exposure, etc, but I have not used these for the majority of picture taking scenarios.  It is a very good point and  click camera with a good flash for indoor pics. I have taken pictures at parties, outdoors (daytime and nightime), in bars (close-ups and group shots) and have always had pretty good results.
The controls are easy to master and well laid out. the built-in lens cover (lens actually recedes into camera body, when turned off) is a godsend -- not having to fumble with (and probably lose) a lens cover makes this a really easy camera to throw in a bag and go.  I purchased the 340MB IBM microdrive and it works flawlessly. I can take about 250 pictures at the highest resolution  -- and the batteries last about 200 pics or so.  When I'm done, I just pop out the microdrive, slap it into a Compact Flash card reader and load the pics on my Mac. Voila!
