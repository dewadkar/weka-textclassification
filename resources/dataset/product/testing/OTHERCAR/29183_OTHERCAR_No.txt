            I have driven two different Neons in the past six months. My job takes me all across the U.S. and the Neon is the car that I have rented most. The first Neon I rented for two months back in June. My first impression was a relatively good one. The A/C worked great, although the engine bogs down heavily when it's on. The interior was ergonomically correct and comfortable. The sound system was above average for a stock setup, but no C.D. player. The seats were very comfortable and cush for nice long drives. I soon realized that the car had some potentially serious problems. When driving up a long hill on the freeways I really had to step into it to keep the car moving. Especially if I was using the A/C. I also noticed that the heavier load that the engine was under, the more the car began to shake and rattle. Where the rattle came from, I don't know. It sounded mechanical. The car also shuttered up hills. It was almost as if I lost complete power for a brief second and then it would do it again. That's a very uncomfortable feeling when your in the middle of nowhere in an unfamiliar state.
The second Neon I drove for about 6 weeks. Right off the bat I experienced the same exact problems that I experienced before. Only this time it was even worse. The car made a loud ticking noise whenever it was first started. This would last a few minutes every time. It sounded like the lifters were knockin. And yes, I did check the oil. The transmission on this car shifted hard under all conditions. The shakes and rattles were abundant throughout, worse than the first one. Both of these Neons had under 15000 miles on them when I rented them. I reported the problems to the rental agency and was told that those were &quot;typical&quot; complaints of people who had rented the Neons. Overall, if the vehicles did'nt feel so mechanically unstable they would have been fun to drive. I would not recommend buying this car for it is bound to be a money pit. I would compare this car to an oversized Geo Metro. It's a cheap car, but you certainly get what you pay for.<br><br>
