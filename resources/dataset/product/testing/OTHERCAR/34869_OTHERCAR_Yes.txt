            When my family first became interested in the odyssey i was a bit skeptical. This was around the time that in was not so popular.  But after alot of looking around and deep consideration we made the purchase.  Its been all smiles from there.  When we made this purchase the top of the line odyssey was the Lx.  It is my belief that it is just as good as the Ex. There are certin qualities that the Lx has that the Ex doesn't.  The main one is the size of the car.  The odyssey lx is the most unique looking minivan on the market.  A problem with minivans over the years is how big and difficult to drive they can be for some people.  The Lx odyssey completly solves this problem. It gives parents a comfortable driving experience while being able to have just as many kids in the car.  Drives just like any compact car.  A revolutionary car. If ur looking for a quality but at a low price, consider the honda odyssey lx. You won't regret it. <br><br>
