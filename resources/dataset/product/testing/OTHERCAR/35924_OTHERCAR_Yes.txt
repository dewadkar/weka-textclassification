            Hi all just had to write about owning a mr2. I have owned many cars in my short life and have been a car fanatic for many years. A few years ago I owned a 85 Mr2 loved the car, it was great. I then after puting 250k miles on it I sold it. I bought another toyota car but still desired the famous 2. Since 91 I have wanted an 91-95 MR2. This last year I bought an 92 non turbo and love it to death. Yeah I could have bought the turbo but for everyday reliability I enjoy the N/A. This car is quick, great fuel economy and always gets looks. If you are searching for a sport car with excelent reliability then look no further. These cars are reasonable in price and offer far more then one could expect. If you want an automatic you can find on in the mr2. I currently have an auto and more then pleased with it. This car is made for handeling and you will be able to run through the mountains with ease. If you desire more speed then consider an turbo. This car is known for outrunning many american muscle cars. I have driven a turbo before my purchase and was very pleased. But when looking for an mr2 find one from an adult not a kid because its probably been raced. These cars are known for best on the track. My opinion buy the non turbo for reliability. Its got more power then you would expect and will be better for your bank account.<br><br>
