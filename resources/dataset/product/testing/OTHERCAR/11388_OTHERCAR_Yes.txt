            Do you have children?  Then a Dodge Caravan is a good choice for your primary family vehicle.  

You'll think that you're driving a family sedan.  Handling is good.  If you've ever have driven the competition, you'll know that how some vans &quot;drive like a truck&quot;. Bumpy and lumpy.  Not the Caravan.  It's a smooth and comfortable drive.

There are also lots of family-friendly features: 2 side doors, cargo room, easy-to-remove rear seat, rear hatch, underseat hidden cupholder. Easy-to-read instrument panel, quality stereo and comfortable seating is perfect for any baby-boomer driver.

The Dodge Caravan continues to be a quality America-made vehicle worth serious consideration.<br>
