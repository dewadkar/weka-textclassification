            I like to begin by saying that the Tundra is the ultimate in trucks. I've
owned Ford and Chevy and those trucks don't compare to the Tundra. I like telling people &quot;that it rides like a Lexus and is tough as an F-150&quot;. My wife and I had seen the Tundra mentioned in a report reviewing a 1998  auto show. We liked what we saw and heard, so we waited for the Tundra. I can honestly say the Tundra was worth the wait. We were the first in the region to receive a Tundra which was around the first week of June 1999 and we haven't stopped driving the truck yet. With 12,000 
miles on the truck so far, we haven't had any real mechanical problems,
but I like to mention a few problems that we have encountered.
1. When slowing to almost a complete stop, the automatic transmission doesn't completely finish down shifting so when you press on the accelerator the trans seems to slip and jump into first gear. I haven't taken the truck in for this problem yet.
2. About 2 weeks after we picked up the truck I noticed that the rear
bumper was hanging a little cockeyed. It turns out that one the brackets
holding the bumper was loose. So the dealership realigned the bumper and tightened up the bracket. To be honest I expected more from a Toyota product.
3. After a recent dealership oil change the truck started to loose about a half a quart of oil every 200 to 300 miles. I took the truck back to the dealer and they ran a compression test and checked for any leaks. No problem was found. The dealership had me run a oil consumption test by
topping off the oil and checking the level after every trip. The problem has mysteriously disappeared.
4. Unusual wear started to appear on both door panel armrests right behind where your elbow would rest. I again took the truck back to the 
dealer. They looked at the door panels and confirmed that there was a problem and ordered 2 new door panels. 
 Even with these problems we wouldn't give up our Tundra for anything.
The over all experience has been excellent. The Tundar is #1.
