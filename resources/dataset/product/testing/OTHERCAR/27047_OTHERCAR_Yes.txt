            My parents bought me this camera for my birthday. I really love using this camera. It can store up to one hundred twenty two pictures. This camera was about five hundred dollars so I expected a tiny bit more from it. For one thing, it uses up batteries like crazy. After about thirty pictures, I had to change the batteries. The thing that uses up all those batteries is the LCD moniter. The LCD moniter can tell you how the picture is going to turn out. It gives you a preview of how the picture will turn out. The butttons are easy to learn and there is a timer. The set comes with a wire that connects to your camera. The software CD that comes with it includes an easy to use program that downloads the pictures off your camera. It is fairly fast. The pictures are very clear but you need a good printer for clear images. You can delete pictures and view them without a printer. The bad thing about this camera set is that it doesn't include a case but it does include a strap. People who enjoy taking photos of everyday life should get this camera. This camera doesn't take the picture fast so it shouldn't be used for fast animals or people.<br><br>
