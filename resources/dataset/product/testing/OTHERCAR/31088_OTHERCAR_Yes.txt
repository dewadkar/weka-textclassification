            As a truck enthusiast, I have driven many different trucks from all makes.  I recently purchased a brand spanking new truck for the first time in my life this past august '99.  I did a considerable amount of research and I found two trucks to be the best on the road: Tundra and Ram.  
Let's compare:
ENGINE:  5.9 (Dodge) and 4.7 (Toyota).  Both motors are tuff!  They got all the power you need and then some.  The Toyota is a four cam job though and is very smooth--also slightly (very slightly) better edge in gas mileage.  ADVANTAGE: Toyota.
TRANNY:  The Dodge tranny tends to wind a little more than the Toyota--not to say it is weaker.  The Toyota simply seems like there is a more solid connection between the crankshaft and the wheels.  ADVANTAGE: Toyota.
INTERIOR:  The Dodge interior is a like a second home.  Big comfortable seats (air inflated lumbar support with power seats!), Large ergonomic display and controls, laptop computer sized armrest storage bin, and general feel of power and control (you are above everybody except 18 wheelers).  The Toyota interior is typical of Japanese carmakers.  It is rather cheap when compared to American carmakers.  It is good; everything is within reach and usable, but it is more cramped (especially rear seating) and just simply is inferior to the Dodge.  ADVANTAGE: Dodge
EXTERIOR:  The Dodge exterior is top-notch.  It is the best looking truck on the road, and I dare you to find a workmanship flaw.  The Toyota is equally well-made, however, the looks just aren't as good as the Dodge.  They need to jack the Tundra up a little.  ADVANTAGE: Dodge
PRICE:  The Dodge has a slight edge in pricing.  ADVANTAGE: Dodge
HANDLING:  The Dodge sits high and therefore, doesn't handle as well as Toyota--on the road.  Off the road, I think the nimble, high-sitting Dodge is a more capable truck.  ADVANTAGE:  Neither.
Overall, I would rate these trucks as equals.  They both have everything you need in a truck, they both have their individual high points though.  I wanted to buy a Tundra.  I truly did; which is amazing b/c I am a loyal American consumer.  I ended up buying a Dodge, which I do not regret AT ALL!  The reason I bought Dodge is that they offered me about $4500 off the retail price.  TOYOTA WILL NOT DEAL.  When I asked the cocky salesman what he could save me on a truck, he said &quot;what you see is what you get--sticker price.&quot;  I told him Dodge was going to save me over $4000 off retail.  He replied, &quot;I don't need to deal.  Let me tell you why:  Toyota is the best.  I have no problem selling.  We'll have all these off the lot by the end of the week.&quot;  Well, after that comment, I marched right over to Dodge and bought.  I guess Toyota sells enough trucks, so they don't need my business.  By the way, every single pickup was still on his lot a month later.   <br><br>
