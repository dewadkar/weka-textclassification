            My wife and I bought a 1999 Volvo S70 GLT in December of 1999.  We are planning to have children soon and she wanted to have a safe car ( I have to drive the cheap vehicle! ).  Anyway, we bought it used with only 17K miles on it.  We have had both good and bad experiences with the car which I will detail below.

First the Good:

1. The safety of the car is outstanding.  You feel safe in this car, since you know the frame is built like a tank and you are surrounded by airbags in front and on the side.  I think Volvo still provides one of the safest cars out there for the price range.

2. The Braking is excellent and I would rate the Handling as very good.  Of all the cars I've owned, I have to say the Volvo seems to be the best at braking of all of them, even better than the BMW M3 I once had!  The handling is tight for a family car of this size.  It handles better than the Maxima SE I had and my wife's old Camary.

3. The S70 GLT is a great highway car for trips.  The ride is smooth and stable.  The best thing about driving the GLT at highway speeds is that the engine is running fast enough to keep the turbo spinning.  This means you have no shortage of power for passing or speeding up, since there is no turbo lag and the boost kicks right in.

4. The sound system in our GLT is excellent.  I don't know all the details, such as the exact number of speakers or the wattage of the amp.  But it definitely has a good amp and I believe there must be a sub-woofer hidden somewhere.  It sounds better than the Bose system in my Maxima SE did and sounds just as good as premium sound system I had in my old BMW M3.  The highs are very well defined and the bass has a tight kick.  You won't have to spend any money upgrading the stereo, unless you want to go deaf.

Now the Bad:

1. Service is expensive. We got our first shock at the oil change.  You are supposed to get 7500 miles out of an oil change, but we live in an Urban area with bad traffic, so I get it changed every 5,000 miles.  The S70 uses a special cartridge filter.  This filter is expensive, so even independent shops and quick lubes charge 55-60 dollars a change.  No 19.95 changes for this car!  The next shock we got was at the 30,000 mile service, which was done at a Volvo dealer.  We also had to get new brake pads at the 30K service, which added to the price.  The service was $450 dollars and the Brake pads were $300 as I recall!  When I was remarking about the cost, the service manager told me that even the motor for the power antenna was $300!!!  Just a warning, expect to pay more than you would for parts and service than non-Europian cars.


2. Reliability is not what I expected.  From all the old Volvos I see on the road, I was expecting superb reliability.  However, what we have experienced is different.  We have 47,000 miles on the car now and we have not had any major problems.  But we have had a bunch of minor ones.  Thankfully, most were handled by the warranty.  A list of problems we have had:

A. Headlight bulbs burning out constantly after only 3-6 months of use.

B. One of the tailights had to be replaced ( entire assembly ).

C. Power Attenna jammed and had to be fixed. It worked for 8 months and now its jammed again.

D. Check engine light started coming on/off.  They traced it to a broken vacuum hose.

E. Turn signal blinker relay was replaced twice.

F. Power steering pump failed and was replaced.

Do you see the pattern?  No major problems, but many annoying minor ones.  I'm afraid at 50,000, when the warranty is expired, we are going to be nickle and dime'd to death!  Because of these minor reliability problems, we will probably go with a used Acura, Lexis, or Infinity next time.

3. Ride quality over bumpy roads.  The S-70 GLT provides good handling for a family type car.  But the suspension is pretty stiff and going over bumpy roads can rattle you a bit.  On occasion, there are also squeaks and rattles when going over large bumps.
