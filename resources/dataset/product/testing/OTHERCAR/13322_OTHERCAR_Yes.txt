            I test-drove a 2002 Forester L as part of my quest for small to mid-sized SUV to replace my Toyota Tacoma pickup truck. I have been undecided about whether to sacrifice the economy I've grown accustomed to (i.e., a mere $12/week for gas)...or to join the legion of SUV owners who map out the area gas stations in advance for frequent fill-ups. As a result, test drives have included everything from the Honda CR-V and Toyota Rav4 to the Nissan Xterra, Ford Escape and Isuzu Rodeo.  Although I was not really considering the Forester at first because I thought it might be a bit too small, it was pointed out that the dimensions are very similar to those of the Rav4, which was one of the vehicles I'd liked. 

The Forester 'L' is considered to be the 'base' model, but that is misleading.  With desirable features like ABS brakes, air conditioning, power windows and locks (to name a few), it is very nicely equipped. The Forester L's interior is quite attractive and does not give the impression that Subaru was trying to cut corners, as is the case with other SUVs in this price range.  The 'S' model offers features such a slightly nicer interior, larger wheels, heated seats and a 6 disc CD changer. 

Driving it was even more impressive.  I found the Forester to be surprisingly peppy for a 4 cylinder, and responsive- with tight steering and smooth shifting in the automatic.  Over patched and bumpy roads, the ride was smooth and steady, and it handled like a dream.  Visibility was excellent. Another pleasant surprise was the quietness of the ride.  Although heavy traffic whizzed by us, we heard nothing but our own conversation. After about 15 minutes, we reluctantly brought the Forester back to the dealer.  This one will definitely make the final cut when it's time to make a purchasing decision.
