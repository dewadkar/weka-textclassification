            I've had my Sunfire over three years now.  In that time, I've had it for everything from cross-country drives to livin' in a big city.  And for both of them, I'd say that I'm extremely glad I bought it.  
The history of Pontiacs tells us that usually the alternator will go out. It did twice on my grand am, twice on my sisters, three times on a friend's bonneville, and once on my parents' grand prix.  However, the alternator has yet to go out on my Sunfire!  Although this may seem a small fact to you, it's a tremendous advantage for me.
Gas mileage is superb (sometimes 35-40 on highways), and it's reliability has been explicit.  I take it in for an oil change every 3500-4000 miles, and even on regular unleaded, it has never had a fuel problem.  
I have yet to have a maintenance problem, as well.  Just replacing the brakes at 52000.  The tires have all worn well, the alignment is still straight, and the interior still shines.  
For me, this Sunfire was a superb purchase.<br><br>
