            I've owned my XL-7 (Touring Edition) for 8 months now and I wished I'd spent the extra dollars for a real mid-sized 4WD vehicle.  Although the leg room for the driver is excellent, that's where the comfort ends.  The narrow frame really cramps me in.  The third row seat is very small and my kids will only ride back there for short trips.  We bought this truck to take onto the beach but we can't fit a cooler and chairs and other beach items in the car unless the rear seat is folded down.  
You would think that the small size would equate to some extra power, but that's not the case.  This thing can barely get out of its own way.  
On the plus side, it looks nice in the driveway and the amenities are plentiful.  Also, the rear seat folds up and relatively quickly (although it took a while to get the "nack" of it).  It is priced very well, and I was able to work a good deal with my local dealer when I leveraged quotes I'd received from on-line dealers.
All in all, I am unhappy with the lack of room and power this truck offers.  If someone were to offer me close to what I paid($22,400), I'd sell it today.
