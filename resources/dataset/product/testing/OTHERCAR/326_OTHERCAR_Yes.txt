              I spent weeks  searching car lots for a competitively priced SUV. I own a Jeep Wrangler and felt it was time to find a second vehicle that would accomodate my HUGE and often drooling Great Pyrenees, (Bogart is his name)and also allow me to  travel in a bit more luxury that a Wrangler just can't provide. Having always driven American made vehicles, I would say I was a bit reluctant to invest in a foreign made vehicle and I based that opinion on rumours that their parts were so much more expensive. I came to terms with the fact, any parts are expensive and convinced myself to take a closer look. On a Sunday morning, I found the Nissan Xterra and felt it was ideal for my needs. Being in the Army and active in the outdoors, along with carting a "monster of a dog" around with me, the Xterra's features were what I needed. A no nonsense interior; removable back seats which act as floatable preservers;  a high interior ceiling; great tie down hooks and even better roof rack amongst many other  features. The exterior is unique. The roof rack is silver powder coated with Xterra logos. Very sporty! The basket bin at the front of the vehicle is great for those small items you want to load on top however keep in mind you must purchase the "net" separately in order to keep things tied down in the basket. The basket also must be removed in order to enjoy the sun roof. If you like the sun roof open, the basket must be taken off. There are 4 easy to twist knobs that release the basket.  I liked the spare tire being underneath and out of sight. This makes for less hardware on the rear gate and it is then not as heavy not to mention no metal for rusting.  Inside the rear gate, is a compact yet well stocked first aid kit which is designed to rest in the molding of the door. Again, this can be purchased separately. The bumpers are thick and a sporty charcoal grey. No polishing needed. 
 There are side steps which you will really find convenient for reaching up to the roof for the Xterra is a bit high  for those of us under 6 feet. I invested that day in a 2000 SE; Mystery black, 5 speed, fully loaded power/utility package. The drive home was smooth, but then, as a Wrangler owner, I would find a farmers cart and mule smooth. The Xterra handled well on the highway. I would say the V6 gave me power when I needed for merging, passing, etc.  While driving I noted a number of passersby pointing at the vehicle and I can assume they found it to be attractive. I did buy the Xterra when it first came out so at that time there weren't too many on the road. Although the overall design of the Xterra appears to be compact (with short hood and rear) the inside space is  phenomenal. Bogart, who weighs in at 150 pds and 34 inches tall doesn't even touch the ceiling when standing up and hanging out the windows. I keep the rear seats down permanently and in doing so, I have amazing space for hauling anything and everything. A recent trip to Lowes and I had planks of wood that fit perfect. NO struggles! The rear allows plenty of leg space and head space for tall passengers. Designed with stadium seating, the rear occupants can look up and over the heads of front passengers.For those sport and nature enthusiasts, this is a fun and reliable vehicle designed to go offroad as needed. The 4wd and "shift on the fly" transfer case is easy to use. As a woman, I don't have to press  200 pounds  just to activate the 4wd/4h/4l.  For those of you who have long or muscular legs, you may find the location of the parking brake throttle  a bit cumbersome when engaged. I would recommend you don't do any parking with your sweetheart or your kneecaps will get bruised. Please note, that last suggestion is not based on my personal  experience..wink, wink! :}  The Clarion AM/FM CD/cassette system is just fine and the speakers put out good sound throughout the entire cab.  The sound carries over the normal "hum" that you typically get while driving on the freeway with an SUV. All of the Xterra's dash controls are easily accessible and big buttons are good for those with even bigger fingers. You do not have to stretch over anything while driving.  
  The trip display on the odometer is a great feature for those of you who like to monitor their trip mileage, or for business people who get reimbursed for travel. Map lights are right up front and give off
great light. The door locks are just great, in that when you use them they all lock/unlock  at the same time. Good safety feature when alone.  Also, the remote keyless
entry is very nice  along with a very good panic mode on the remote.
  My cons to date, include windows that rattle when down a little bit. You have to find a "happy medium" in order to stop them from rattling. This is a manufacturer defect that new drivers will now be aware of. The rest of us who bought early, were guinea pigs to some of the irks and quirks that go along with new vehicles. Note, that I highly recommend the purchase of window ventshades. The design of the windows unfortunately allows for a lot of rain/snow runoff , down and in the window when its opened. This can cause the water to drip down & into the power controls for the window. Again, another manufacturer design defect. You can expect some cabin noise when on the highway, (which is normal for me for I have Bogarts head out the window the entire time). By cracking the front window a little you can alleviate some of that noise. The Xterra has had some problems with oil caps disappearing. On some models, the cap loosens from the threads and is gone. Some owners have had to go so far as to secure a small chain to the cap and then to the block to stop this. Nissan has assured those who have this issue, that they can fix it and will do so at any dealer. I have been lucky to not have this problem. The fabric headliner inside the cab, if touched frequently (i.e, vacummed, bikes pressed against it, etc) will get cracking sounds. These sounds are caused by the insulation that is used to secure the headliner to the ceiling. It is a spray foam that hardens and can go brittle if touched. Thus, the cracking sounds. The dealer will respray the foam if needed. In  my case, 4x I have had it done. For now, I have no cracking. I have accessorized my Xterra recently. Adding a Manik front brush guard, Ventshades, Nissan cargo liner (a must for dog owners and hunters), AT 16in rims, Nissan front bug guard to stop those nasty rock chips. Its a fun and mechanically reliable vehicle which has many options for accessorizing based on the owners preference. 
   All in all the Xterra is great fun and reasonably priced as far as the SUV market stands today. The dealers are knowledgable and Nissan Consumer affairs have made every effort to keep me updated. With a range of fun and classic colors to choose from along with ample options too, MY XTERRA is the better than the rest!!!  Now, I wonder if I can trade in that Wrangler for a mule and cart. I would get better MPG!
