            I love almost everything about this camera. I have owned mine for over one year and I have few complaints, and high praise.

Let me start by saying that I rate and have expectations from the camera relative to what is it. Meaning, I would not buy a Geo Metro and expect a BMW. That being said, for a 1.5-mega-pixel camera I find the picture quality excellent. I have reproduced many of the photos on print I have taken through my local printshop. The printed quality of the digital photo prints rivals most non-digital prints I was able to compare at the shop on many occasions. 

There are enough features in the camera to allow you to customize your photos and picture taking style. You will not feel as if you are simply at the mercy of the camera. The Auto-shutter feature is a great way to capture action shots where you can not simply say �OK, hold it right there." You can activate the slow shutter mode, with or without the use of the flash, to create cool effects such as motion blurring.

The 3x optical zoom gives a feel of a conventional camera and is very useful. While many camera have higher level digital zooms, you will often find the you wind up seeing what the camera THINKS the distant object looks like through the use of refined digital interpolation, sometimes it is good sometimes not. An optical zoom is just that, optical, through the lens, not electronics. Although only 3x, you will find it a true representation of the object photographed. 

The Macro feature on the camera will let you focus down to a few cm of an object. Using the macro you can photograph things as fine as the fine print of a newspaper with ease.

The digital LCD screen is a perfect size and high resolution, but you will find it is nearly useless in bright sunlight. In these cases, using the built in viewfinder will yield equally good photos.

The controls are located perfectly, however some buttons are a bit small and you might find it easy to fat-finger a button from time to time. 


All silver clouds have dark linings, or is that the other way around, anyway there are a few downfalls.

The auto timer on the camera does not allow you to modify the same settings that you can when you are taking pictures normally. I have found this a minor problem and have taken some of the best remote photos in my life with this camera.

If you have a very sharp eye you will notice that photos tend to have a slight fisheye perspective. If you were to take a photo of an object with perfectly straight parallel lines from top to bottom at the furthest edges of the useful display, you will note that the lines curve outward slightly in the middle and inward at the top and bottom. Like I said, unless you have a sharp eye and are looking for it you may never notice it. I use my camera for business and often have to take pictures of telecommunication equipment racks, which are pretty straight. 

This camera EATS power!! The battery takes some time to charge and has little to show for it when it is charged. A second battery might be needed to get the most flexibility out of the camera. I find that I try to use the LCD screen only to view photos, and not to take them. This greatly adds to battery life.

The serial interface should be a last resort, unless you like long waits. This really has nothing to do with Fuji or the camera; it really comes down to the speed of the serial bus in today�s computers. I would suggest an aftermarket SmartMedia reader, either floppy or USB based. I personal own a ScanDisk USB SmartMedia reader, which allows instant access to my photos, without killing the camera battery in the process. 

Last but not least, don�t drop it. No kidding, right? After all it is a camera. The die-cast shell might give you the false sense of durability, but believe me the inside of this camera is packed tightly. Drops or hard shocks will damage it easily.

Other then that this camera is a dream. I would recommend it to anyone. At the same time I would recommend four other options.

External SmartMedia reader � Speeds things up and saves battery power

Extra Smart Media of 16 or 32 Meg � The 8 Meg Smart Card is just too small and will only allow for about 14-16 Hi-Res. pictures.

Extra Battery � Because when the battery dies and you are away from home or the hotel, you are out of luck.

Tripod � Great for timed shots, or when you use the slow shutter setting (Unless you can hold yourself robotic like still)
