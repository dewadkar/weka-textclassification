            I owned a 2001 Nissan Xterra (2WD) for two and a half years and it was a great vehicle the entire time I had it.  It came with a 3.3(200) V6 that puts out 170 HP and 200 Ibs/torque, and trust me...it picks up pretty quick for an SUV.  The interior offered water-resistant seats and a 6-disc CD changer along with all of your other good options (power windows, brakes, steering, cruise control, etc.).  It also came with an awesome roof rack that can be used for holding surfboards, canoes, luggage, you name it.  Most people who write reviews for the Xterra are probably going to complain about gas mileage...but it's really not that bad.  The 2WD model I had got 16 MPG in the city and 20 MPG on the highway, and got approximately 320 miles to the tank.  Even though I didn't have the 4WD model, I'm sure it is not that much worse with the gas mileage (maybe a loss of 2 MPG at most).  This vehicle can fit five people in it comfortably, but one time I actually got 8 people inside (including me).  Reliability on a scale of 1 to 10 is 10.  I put over 46,000 miles on my Xterra and never had any problems with it.  Take care of it, and it will take care of you.  You can easily pimp Xterras out too...I had 17" Pacer rims (not overdone), dual exhausts (which sounded pretty good for a 6-cylinder), dark, tinted windows, and a 12" Kicker Subwoofer with a Kicker amp in the back.  The Nissan Xterra is definitely worth the money if you are considering buying a mid-size SUV that has a great design but is still rugged enough to go offroad.  The only bad thing about the Nissan Xterra is that it loses it value fairly quick.  In the 2 1/2 years I owned it, it went from $25,000 brand new to $14,000 when I traded it in at a dealership (and that was more than the blue book value, which was around $12,000).
