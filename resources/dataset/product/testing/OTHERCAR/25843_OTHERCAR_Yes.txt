            In September 1999 I purchased a 2000 Cherokee sport. This Cherokee replaced my previous 1994 Cherokee Sport which I logged 120,000 miles on. I purchased the 2000 Cherokee to continue my loyalty to the no-nonsense, straight-forward, military looking, tried and true line of jeep sport utility vehicles. I now have over 16,000 miles on the new Cherokee because I drive it at least sixty miles a day almost on a daily basis The 2000 is an improvement over the older 1994 in design and ergonomics but it is still basically the same vehicle. The dashboard has a more compact and current look. The climate controls of the 1994 looked right out of the sixties. The 2000 offers the circular controls seen in more expensive luxury cars. The ride of the 2000 is quite similar to the 1994, but the interior noise has been reduced a bit. I noticed when I first drove off the lot in the new Jeep the power was not what I had been used to in the '94. It seemed more restrained. I found at about the 15,000 mile mark that the power had matched the power I experienced with the old Sport. I surmise this is due to the break-in period being over. As with the '94, there is an annoying clunk in the drive line when coming to a stop. This is due to spring back in the axle and can be remedied at the dealer for a small (if any) fee. The rear passenger compartment is cramped and entry  is restricted. The in-line six cylinder is a bit noisy and the ride on the pavement is rough. At 14,000 miles I had to have the rotors turned to eliminate the pulsating stops from the premature rotor warping. It is still a great value and you will always look and feel good getting where you are going. And nobody will think you are really going to the supermarket instead of the sticks.       <br><br>
