            I got my Mercedes two weeks ago. I got it because its such a sporty yet classy vechicle. Its got all of the upgrades of the top of the line Mercedes. It has a powerful V6. The minute I took this cute little sucker I fell in love with it. It was so hard to find and when I saw it I was like Ow my God!!!!!! Praise the Lord I found what I am looking for. I jumped at my chance to get it. It was a used one that was the last one on the lot. The dealers used it as a Demo so it had really low milage. I knew then that this was my lucky day.
      The inside of this Baby is all leather and it has a 6 cd changer and a telephone so I can call my friends from the inside of my car and they could call me. Besides I was looking for a car Phone but since my car came with one I didn't have to bother buying one. It has a sun roof so I can get my fresh air during a nice day. 
      This car drives like a dream and the handeling is just so amazing. It handles better than any other sport car that I've owned. Its the kind of car that will have everyone turning their heads to look at it. I highly recommend that you get this vechile if your looking for something relly classy yet sporty so you are deffinetly driving in style. You can get this car brand new at your nearest Mercedes dealer at almost any price and let me tell you it is worth the money.<br><br>
