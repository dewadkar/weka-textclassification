            I have only owned Hondas so it wasn't too hard deciding that Honda was the way to go.  At first I thought it was very expensive compared to the American models.  However, once you compare &quot;apples to apples&quot; the Honda van is very cost effective and above all...reliable!

I love everything about the van, the appearance, handling, features, MAGIC SEAT....unbelievable.  I have had zero problems with the van so far AND if I did, my dealership, Barrie Honda in Ont. Can. would service me to &quot;death&quot; to ensure my satisfaction.  It was really refreshing to deal with a dealership that definately had the &quot;vehicle&quot; that is so in demand and still treated me like they were lucky I was there.  Anybody in the Southern Ontario Region that would like to purchase any Honda product should really take a drive to Barrie Honda and see James Marlow &quot;the sales guy&quot; for some &quot;down to earth&quot; car/van shopping!

This van is exactly like driving a car...except obviously slightly longer.  Handles like a car (upscale).  I am very interested to see how it will handle in the winter.  Handling in the rain has not been an issue at all.  I feel very safe in this vehicle.
