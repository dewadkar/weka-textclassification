            I�ve wanted a digital camera for a while now, and when I found a fantastic deal on the Kodak DC3200 (and after I read the reviews on it at Epinions.com of course), I pounced on it!  

Here are the general specs of this camera.  It has a 1.2 MP CCD, but the camera only supports 1.0 MP.  It features a standard 1.6� LCD, a flash, 2X digital zoom, a 2MB internal storage area, Compact Flash expandability, and a serial interface to your computer.  It does not come with an AC adapter, lens cap, compact flash card, timer, or carrying case.  

The box is bright yellow, aesthetically pleasing, and safely packages the camera.  Inside is a pack with your warranty card (I would just register online, it�s much easier), user manual, Quick Start Guide (which is handy for people who don�t want to bother with the manual), and finally a wrist strap (that I highly recommend you use for safety).  In a green bag is the serial cable connector.  Then you see a neat flap that congratulates you on your purchase, and once opened reveals the wrapped DC3200.

At first look the camera is a little smaller than I had anticipated.  For you technophiles out there, it�s 4.45� (113cm) wide by 3.2� (81cm) tall with a depth of 2.1� (53.4cm).  This size is just barely pocketable in a cargo pocket for me, but that may not be the case for smaller people.  The camera was also heavier (keep in mind that I was used to playing with a worthless JamCam) than I had expected.  In reality it weighs 7.6oz (215g) w/o batteries.    The body is made of a dark gray plastic that is very hard and seems to be very durable.  This was one caveat that I didn�t like with this camera, that it was plastic.  I would have preferred a metal exterior myself, preferably something much more shiny in silver.  However, for the price I could not argue, and it will hold up better against scratches so this may be a plus later on.  

The back of this camera has of course a viewfinder, a 1.6� LCD, a menu button, up and down menu selection buttons, a select button, a flash select button, and a 3 position slider for Off, Capture, and Review.  The separate flash selection button is a very nice touch on Kodak�s part.  Changing flash settings is a common task for me (especially when taking close-up picture as you will see below), I love being able to choose the flash without navigating the menu so much, it makes me wish there was a picture quality button but too many direct buttons would be cost prohibitive.  The buttons are all pretty small, but I can use them pretty well even though I have pretty large hands.  The slider was slightly cumbersome for me sometimes at first because of its size and sometimes I skipped over the middle notch when moving it.  I got used to this eventually.  I would have preferred a rotating knob on the other (higher end) Kodak cameras though.  This is a low-cost camera and you have to make sacrifices somewhere and this is a minor one.  

On the sides of the camera are the rest of the functions you need.  On the top is the shutter release.  On the right side (assuming your holding it in picture taking position) are a PC link connection, then a video out connection (separate accessory), wrist strap hole and the battery compartment.  On the bottom is the CF cover that is just a piece of latching plastic covering the bay along with your model number, FCC certifications, and serial number.  On the left side is the port for the 7-volt proprietary (see below) AC adapter.  The front features the round lens on the right (looking directly at the front of the camera).  A wide flash, and the viewfinder window, a black triangular piece with a grip, and at the bottom edge a piece of plastic used to stabilize the camera when placed on something (nice idea from Kodak).  

Let�s explore preparing the camera for use.  The Quick Guide pamphlet will guide you through this but I ignored it and started using it immediately because it really isn�t necessary I don�t think.  First you put in the four AA batteries (supplied).  The proper directions are very easy to understand as the directions are inscribed inside the casing.  Closing the hatch is somewhat difficult because the metal contacts on the door have to bend to accommodate it.  So just push slowly but surely and eventually it will line up and then you slide the hatch down to secure the batteries!  Now I turned it on by moving the slider to the middle notch, Capture (signified by a camera icon).  It takes 4-5 seconds for the camera to start up.  Then it gives you a screen that says, �Accessed internal memory. To access card, insert memory card�.  Depending on whether Preview is enabled or not, you will get an active view of what you�re taking a picture of right away, if not you can get the LCD to show this by pressing the Select button.  

The menu interface is pretty intuitive.  When in Capture mode you have the options of Quality, White Balance, Quickview, Preview, and Format.  Access the menu by press the Menu button. Choose your option by using the up and down Selector buttons, and press select to choose.  Quality is what determines how good your pictures will look.  Good is 576X432.  This is perfect for quick pictures via e-mail to friends or web publishing.  You can get about 25 of these on the 2MB of internal memory.  The next is Better, which is 1154X 864 with higher compression.  I don�t really find much use for this setting so far.   You get about 12 or so I would guess with the 2MB internal memory. The next is Best which is also 1154X864 but with low compression for use in very high quality graphics, or when you want to print out up to 5X7s on your printer.  You can get 3-4 in the internal memory.  The size of pictures varies because the more different stuff in your picture there is, the more memory you need.  For example, taking a picture of a complex painting with many details will require lots of memory, where in a picture where half of the image is a blue sky will take less memory.  One thing I notice about the DC3200 is that the pictures remaining indicator on the LCD (accessed by pressing Select), often underestimates your capacity.  It�s very pessimistic and assumes you are taking very complex pictures, which is often not the case.  

Next is white balance which lets you choose between Auto, Daylight, Fluorescent, and Tungsten.  Personally, I just leave it at Auto so I don�t have to mess with it.  Then I correct my photos very easily with Paint Shop Pro 7 (which is a good alternative to Photoshop for those who don�t have access to a Software agreement that most colleges offer or who aren�t rich).

The next three options are Quickview, Preview and Format.  Quickview is an option that is enabled in the default settings.  It automatically pops up your photo on the LCD for a few seconds, a second after you take it.  This is a very worthwhile feature and I can�t see why anyone wouldn�t have it on.  The next is Preview, which I leave off.  This automatically turns on your LCD to get an active look at what your pictures will look like.  The quasi-video stream is kind of choppy, but this is a photo camera, not a video camera we have to remember.  I don�t see why you would want it to automatically pop up because the LCD is the main battery user and I would only use it on demand with the Select button.  The last is format, which will totally clear out your internal memory, or format a CF disk if inserted.  

When the camera is in Review mode the options are Delete, PC Connect, Print Order, Protect, Slide Show, Copy and Format.  When scrolling through your photos by pressing the up and down buttons, or when you have one photo highlighted in the 6 thumbnail view (accessible by pressing Select) you can use this function.  The Delete function is very intuitive because it shows you the actual image you are deleting, and then allows you to scroll through the different images without exiting the delete function.  PC Connect has off and on.  Print Order is for selecting the order in which files will be printed when you stick a CF Card into a direct photo printer such as the PM200 available from Kodak.  I don�t have such a printer so I can�t comment on this feature.  Next is Protect, which is used to protect photos from accidental deletion in all circumstances but when the Format function is used.  The Slide Show is for when you buy the Video out adapter from Kodak that I also don�t have so I can�t comment.  Next is copy which is for when you have a CF card and you have pictures in internal memory that you want to export to a CF card so you don�t have to plug the camera in (more on this later).  The last is format, same function as it was in the Capture mode.  The DC3200�s webpage has a nice shockwave example of how the camera works that I suggest @ http://www.kodak.com/US/en/digital/cameras/dc3200/

Now for some picture taking!  All you have to do is turn the camera on in Capture mode (move the slider over to the camera icon).  Then you need to select what quality you want if its not already what you want by pressing menu, then selecting quality, then the quality you want.  You can select what flash mode you want by pressing the flash button.  There is Auto, Fill (force flash), and Off.  If you like you can turn on the LCD screen to get an active view of what the camera sees.  This how is how you see the Status information as well.  Activate the screen by pressing Select.  You see a picture of a battery that is either Full, Low, or Flashing (can�t take a picture).  I wish there would have been more comprehensive battery information, but you go through batteries quickly enough that it doesn�t really matter.  Next is the quality selection that is 1, 2, or 3 bars.  3 bars are best, 2 bars is better and 1 is good.  Then you have your flash settings.  On the right are how many pictures you can put on your internal memory or CF card at the current quality setting.  This estimate is very pessimistic though and you will most likely being able to cram a good amount more into it.   

Frame your picture and press the shutter release button down.  If you do it halfway it will focus-lock.  You have to press the button farther down then you might expect.  The tactile feedback is �ok�, nothing wonderful though.  After it takes the picture there are two light �twangs�, and your flash that tells you a photo has been taken.  There is a delay of about 2 seconds before the picture is taken.  A second later your picture will pop up on your screen (assuming you have Quickview enabled).  It�s that simple.  If you don�t like the picture you have to go into Review mode to delete it, which is a minor annoyance I think. Deletion in Capture mode would have been a nice feature.  You can go into Review mode to look at all your pictures by scrolling through them with the up and down buttons.  You can see 6 at a time by pressing select to show you the small thumbnails.  If you want to use the 2X digital zoom, you need to be in Good mode, and have the LCD viewfinder on.  You zoom in by pressing the up button.  I really don�t use this feature too much yet but I may later on.  

One thing I noticed with this camera is that when you take close-ups of things, the flash will fire anyway and wash out your photos terribly.  This is where the hardware button for the flash is a very good idea.  Whenever you are on top of something, you must disable the flash.  Luckily, since this is a digital camera all you have to do is delete the botched photo and try again.  

You need to get your pictures onto your computer now.  Pull out the serial cable they gave you, and plug it into your computer.  You should shut it off to do this.  It�s a shame they couldn�t have made this USB.  Serial is far, far slower and is not hot swappable (can plug it in without turning your computer off).  Now plug the other end of the Serial cable into your camera (top hole on the right side).  Now go into Review mode, and activate the PC Link function. Assuming you�ve already installed the software, run the capture software on your computer and it will automatically connect showing you all your photos.  Select which ones you want to download and press the icon to download.  It�s a very simple, albeit slow process.  To transfer 1 better picture and two best quality pictures it took 2:39.  There total size was 789KB; so the transfer rate comes down to about 5KB/sec, which is the average, download speed of a 56K modem for comparison.  This is a very long time when you have lots of photos.  If you filled up a smaller 8MB CF card, it would take 25 and a half minutes.  Imagine the battery drain if you didn�t have an AC adapter! 

Using a CF card to store photos is very easy and straightforward.  Just open the bottom bay and slide it in until the eject button sticks out all the way.  When you turn on the camera it will tell you its accessing the card, and when you have the LCD icon on, instead of a camera next to the shots remaining indicator, it shows a CF card to remind you what medium you are using.  It�s all very seamless.  I noticed that when I was taking pictures that pictures stored much faster on the CF than internal memory.  On best mode it takes about 5seconds a shot for internal memory and with the CF it was about one to two.  

When I transferred the same photos from a CF Card (I used the copy function to transfer the internal memory to a card, which took about 2 seconds), it took somewhere just under 2 seconds.  That 8MB CF card now takes less than 20 seconds compared to 25 minutes.  Infact, it may be even faster for long transfer because the small amount of data (789KB) didn�t give it time to reach its full transfer rate.  Either way USB CF readers put the built in serial connection to shame.  You also do not drain the batteries transferring photos, which is something else important to consider.

Kodak comes with imaging editing software that is a full screen Shockwave jobby that I really just don�t care for.  Programs like Jasc�s Paint Shop Pro (around $70 at common stores) or Adobe Photoshop are much more intuitive and offer a familiar workspace.  I haven�t bothered with it really so I can�t comment on how good it is. I am already a happy user of Paint Shop Pro at home and Photoshop for school already so I stuck with what I had used before.

I am very impressed with the photos I take with this camera at Good mode.  They are already sized perfectly for Internet use and they are only 80KB or so.  For sharing photos with friends I always use this.  The Better setting I find little use for, it just looks a blurry Best quality photo.  If you reduce this it�s a nice medium between the two if you need something a little better than the Good setting.  Best makes great photos for printing at 5X7, but for any actual use you must reduce their size with a program.  They are so large in fact that Better and Best photos take up my whole screen nearly (I run at 1280X1024).  The Best photos when examined closely are not quite up to quality with scanned 5X7s I don�t think, but you don�t ever use photos this large for anything but printing, in which these super-minor details are un-noticeable!  Again for computer use, the �Good� setting works best for me.  To view some samples photos, and of the equipment I use such as my CF reader go to http://www.geocities.com/MikeD03C/dc3200/index.htm.  Pictures that end in good, better, and best are taken at those respective image qualities.  I did this shooting spree at night, so there was some minor, very basic contrast and color saturation work done with Paint Shop Pro.  I have not yet done any picture taking outside in daylight, and if I ever do take some I�ll try to post them on that page.

The internal memory will only go so far, and if you take anything above Good pictures, you won�t get anywhere near a regular roll of film.  Luckily this camera is CF expandable.  You insert CF cards into the bottom by opening the latch and sliding them in.  It�s a very straightforward process that you can�t mess up.  I wish Kodak would have put the CF slot on the left side, but this is a minor quibble.  Also, I would have preferred it on the side with a rubber covering instead of the latch that should hold up �ok� with repeated use, but I tend to be hard on my electronics.  This is a personal preference only though, your opinion on this will vary.  I bought a 16MB CF card for $32.  I�ve heard of someone paying $50 for a 8MB card, which is sort of high I think.  I wouldn�t pay more than $45 for a 16MB card generally.  

Since the camera is serial it has a very slow transfer rate as mentioned above.  If you buy a compact flash (CF) card (which you will end up doing if you want to take many Best photos at all), I recommend getting a CF reader.  If you have a laptop this is extremely easy.  Just get a PCMCIA card reader for about $6 and you�re set.  For those who have desktops you might consider a USB card reader.  I bought one for $28.  It�s a very nice design that fits nicely into a USB port, or has an extension cord.  It came with quite a bit of free software too surprisingly!  Using a CF card with the serial connection to be blunt isn�t feasible really.  It just takes too long.  You need to get a CF Reader.  Also keep this in mind, once you get a CF card, you can still use your internal memory (although its sort of an emergency reserve now), and copy them to a CF for transfer via your card reader.  To transfer a full 8MB CF card it would take about 25 minutes with the camera�s serial interface, with my USB reader it would take about  20 seconds.  It�s a good investment. Trust me!  

I mentioned above that there were a few things not included.   The first is a lens cover.  This is available from Kodak for $5, but I have no idea why they didn�t include it.  It�s a piece of plastic, how much can it hurt production costs?  Next is that it didn�t come with a carrying case; it�s a minor quibble I suppose.  I have to remind myself what I paid for it and recognize they had to scrimp somewhere.  It also did not come with an AC adapter.  This wouldn�t have been such a big deal, because you can pick up an AC adapter for cheap at a local store for under $10.  However, the DC3200 uses a proprietary 7-volt setting.  The closest on my universal adapter was 7.5, and the DC3200 would not work on any of the settings!  I was very upset about this.  Kodak charges $40 for an AC adapter, $50 for an international version. (!)  This money is better spent on rechargeable batteries.

I bought a combo Energizer AccuCharger pack at Sam�s Club for $25.  It included a regular charger that lets you do 4 AAs, 4 AAAs, or 2 9-volt batteries at once.  It comes with 6 AA Accuchargeable batteries and 4 AAA Accuchargeable batteries.  Accuchargeable is Energizer�s name for NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride).  When shopping for rechargeable batteries, do not get NiCAD (Nickel Cadmium), as they have a memory effect (requires you to drain batteries completely before charging or you will loose charge capacity).  Consider applications for rechargeables in your house and you will see that getting a nice set like this is a good idea.  In my case it worked out perfectly.  There are 4AAs for my DC3200, 2AAs for my CD Player, and 2 sets of 2 AAAs for my Visor Deluxe (that I had been wanting to get rechargeables for anyway). 

This camera goes through batteries very quickly.  It�s mostly the LCD that drains batteries, so use it sparingly.  I played with mine so much the first day I had it the battery indicator was already indicating �Low� after extended use.  After shutting it off and leaving it for a minute or two it returned to Full.  There is a similar effect on all high drain devices�such as PDAs.  So I would say rechargeable batteries are a must.  This would also allow you to play with the LCD without worrying about wasting your batteries, be more eco-friendly, and save you money!

If you�re looking for cheap, effective way to break through to the digital age, I recommend this camera.  I wouldn�t pay the MSRP of $230 for it though.  I�ve seen it for $150 with rebates and if you see it for this price I would go for it.  Keep in mind though that if you want this to turn into a replacement for a regular camera you�ll have to buy a CF card to expand your memory (you have to do this with nearly all digital cameras anyway).  Also, since this camera is not USB, unless you have a very long time (example, go make dinner or do laundry while it downloads), I would recommend you get a CF reader for around $30.  Also, since you will go through batteries every 100-200 shots I would bet, you will want rechargeable batteries.  Or you will want them after you�ve gone through 5 sets and realize the money you could have saved on buying rechargeables right from the start. 

I ended up spending $25 on my charger kit (keep in mind I had 2 extra AAs and 4 AAAs for the price too), $28 on my USB CF reader, and $32 for a 16MB CF card (I should be able to jam around 50 Best photos on there which is plenty for a short to medium event).  I paid $110 (I found it online for $150 and used a $40 off $150 coupon), for this camera, and ended up spending $85 to make is very usable.  Keep this in mind if you want to get the most out of this camera.  The next step up Kodak camera is the DC 3400 (which offers many, many more options keep in mind like 3X optical zoom, USB, 2.1MP, 8MB CF card included, etc), which is available for $350 online according to Ibuyer.net.  If you�re very serious about out of the box digital photography you might investigate this.  However if you want a great, cheap, introduction into the digital photography field�I recommend this camera.  It lets me put photos onto the Internet easily, and lets me print out 5X7s that are photo realistic.  That�s all I wanted and that�s what I got.  I just ended up wanting to expand it more.  Evaluate your needs carefully, and then decide on which digital camera best suits your needs and wants.  I do recommend a Kodak camera though, everyone I know has good luck with them and I�m very satisfied with my 3200 for what I paid for it.  

-Update-
Well I've been using the camera for some time now and I'm still very satisfied with it. I got hold of the video cable Kodak produces. It's a very nice add on. I have used it once at a party and it definitely was a crowd pleaser. There are side effects like "Hey! Delete that picture!" when people see themselves in an odd shot though. I guess that's the price of digital photography. Kodak wants to charge you an insane amount for this cable; I got it for $3.50 on Ebay. It's a nice add-on, but not worth what they want for it. 

Also, flash memory prices have come down quite a bit! The take size in megabytes times two and you get a reasonable price rule doesn't apply anymore. It should be around a buck a meg for a good price now.


-Update2-
I've had this camera for six months now and I figured I'd give a long term update.  The camera is still holding together very well.  CF prices have come down yet again.  You can pay under a dollar/meg easily now.  Browsing around I see a 32MB card for $24 and a 64MB card for $41.  I've also found out that I don't like to use this camera as much as I used to.  The camera is too bulky and heavy to carry around feasibly.  This would not be the case with more smaller cameras.  An excellent example is the Canon S100 which I fell in love with when I saw.  If you want to take this with you for spontaneous shoots than I can't really reccomend it.  I somewhat regret my purchase now that I realize portability was more important to me than I thought.  Lowered prices lead me to lower this to three stars.  If you're serious about carrying this around you probably should look elsewhere unless you get a really good deal on this.
