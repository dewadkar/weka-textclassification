            This is my first digital camera.  It is a gift, so I did not really spend too much time comparing with other brand's camera.  The software that comes with it is fairly easy to install on my HP Pavilion with WindowsME.  To access the pictures in the camera is also very easy.  You plug in the USB cable to your PC at one end and the camera at the other end, your PC will show you a &quot;removeable drive&quot;, which contains every pictures in JPEG file format.  You just treat them like the regular drive, folders, and files.  

Maybe I do not have very steady hands.  When I use the &quot;short distance&quot; setting of the camera to take a picture of something really close to me, I either get fussy pictures, or somehow the flash light makes the pictures kind of &quot;yellowish&quot;.  If I set it to the normal setting, I do not have this problem.  

Since I do not print the pictures out on photo papers, the resolution and the quality provide by this camera is good enough for me.  I put the pictures on the website, and they look fantastic.  For a non-professional user like me, this 1.3M pixel digital camera is a pretty good one.<br><br>
