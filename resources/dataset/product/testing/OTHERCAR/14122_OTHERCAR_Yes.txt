            Dodge Viper. Great name, better car.
 Where to start with such a glorious piece of machinery. I guess a few specifications would be appropriate. These are for the Viper R/T, since that is my favorite.
$70,925 base price
450hp at 5,200 rpm, 8.0L overhead valve V10!! 6-speed transmission, seats 2, 17&quot; tires,  and it averages around 13mpg city/21mpg highway, not too bad. Standard drivers and passenger air-bags to help you feel better at 150 mph, not that any of us would ever do that.
 I think to truly understand the beauty and greatness of this car a person would have to look in person at it. Better yet drive it! This is absolutely going to be looked at one of the best automobiles ever produced in the coming years. A truly exotic car that can compete with anything on the road, Lamborghini, Porsche, Ferrari, and yes even the beloved classic Corvette.
 As far as appearance goes, it's really just personal taste. to me the Viper is hands down the best looking car out on the road today. The round curves, great big tires, and a fantastic interior makes this car both beautiful, and tough looking. it really does something that very, very few cars nowadays can do; bring back memories of the legendary past muscle cars of yesteryear. But not only does it have the styling, it has the power and speed to match them as well. 
 The only drawback I can find would be the price, but then again, it is a true <i>sports<i> car, elite, exotic and therefore expensive.
 All true sports car enthusiasts should at least drive this car once even if they can't afford it. Whatever it takes, because this is one intense ride.
