            I was so excited the first time I was approved for credit to buy my 1996 Cavalier.  Butterflies in my stomach and this utter elation that this shiny red car would be mine.
Now, it is 1999 almost 2000 and I am not so thrilled.
If you read other reviews about this car you will notice a problem with rattling.  Do you know how irritating this gets?  Its the whole dashboard assembly.  Somehow, (maybe it's the heat) it gets loose and begins to rattle.  Everywhere.  All the time.  I had to cram some loose paper in the crack to keep it from doing that.  
The paint is another matter all together.  It doesn't adhere to its surface.  Look at a lot of the GM cars and look at the front bumper.
Notice something?  The paint flakes off.  I live in Arizona, so we don't get a lot of rain.  That's not the cause.  I think the cause is that
the plastic bumper and the paint that is used are incompatible with each other.  It looks terrible.  It is also happening in the hood of the car.
Having a car that looks nice is important.  You are making the payments and everyday you have to look at the bumper.  I took it to my dealer and they refused to fix it.  It started happening just after the warranty.
Go figure. 
Something else that happened is my air conditioning went out right after I bought it.  Luckily it was under warranty.  It broke again and I took it back again.  Haven't had any problems since...knock on wood.

There are some redeeming things about the car.  Good gas milage.  Its 4 cylinder engine is good at saving you a buck or two in this department.
The car has day lights to reduce accidents.  This is a nice feature.
The car also has driver and passenger airbags...another safety feature that is appreciated.

I haven't had any mechanical problems other than what I have described
above.  Nothing since.  I have put 56000 miles on the car so far.
The paint thing and the rattling have left me feeling cheated however and will prevent me from recommending this car to anyone.
