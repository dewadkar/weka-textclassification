            Nikon Coolpix 950 is a great digital camera for using with your PC.  Can use up to 32mb memory cartridges which stores over 100 pictures.  High quality pictures full of color and easy editing from your PC with the right software. (Photoshop recommended).  

I have problems with the red-eye reduction.  Doesn't seem to work to well and is not the flash default so you have to constantly set it and if you forget, red eye is imminent.

View screen is great and allows you to decide on whether or not you want to keep photo instantly.  Never again do you have to pay for pictures you don't want.  I think the price is still too high, but I felt at the time of purchase it was still the best quality camera out there.
