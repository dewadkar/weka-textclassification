<TEXT>
            I bought my convertible Sebring 3 years ago, and I love it!  There is nothing like the feeling of driving around with the top down on a great day.  It reduces stress and improves my mood - which was well worth the price paid for it.

Mechanically, I have had no major problems at all.  The only complaint I might offer is that the seals on the windows have the tendency to leak air and or water (car washes are terrible).  But, as mot people have said, that is the price you pay for having a convertible.  So, I'll take that little annoyance and drive around with the top down instead!

I highly recommend this car - if not for its reliability, then for the way it makes you feel.  You'll never drive another car that isn't a convertible!<br><br>
