            In the winter of 1994 I attended a car show, and there under the argon lights was a Bright Platinum Metallic LHS. The styling was so captivating, I just had to buy it. I rented one for the weekend and was so impressed I ordered one and took delivery in April '95. I had the windows tinted so it looks even more sleek and attractive.

I had been in the market for a new car and needed the space of a large car, but couldn't afford a Lexus or BMW. This car came loaded, sunroof and all, plus a limo-like back seat and huge trunk for a reasonable price. It drives as sporty as the BMW, but the ride isn't as harsh. 

I'm pleased to say that this has been the most trouble free car I've ever owned. I a thrilled with the gas mileage 19 city and 32 hwy. On one cross-country trip I got 34.5 MPG, 620 miles between fill-ups. The traction control really works well, especially in snow.

At 60k miles I had a complete maintenance overhaul, basically anything old, worn or dirty, even the water pump (which my mechanic told me was about to go). I've only had to replace the front brake pads(54,000m), the rears are still original. The one and only time it returned to the dealer was to replace the climate control module because the fan was stuck on high. This took only 30 minutes, barely enough time to look around in the showroom. I'm especially pleased that the car has stayed new looking, both inside and out. 

All that styling and interior space come at the expense of parking.
The rear fenders are invisible to see, and backing up requires a lot of intuition. This thing needs that new parking radar some cars have now.
A new set of tires has decreased the road noise somewhat, but I drown that out with the Infinity sound system anyway. And the headlights are weak on the low beam setting, although the fog lights help a little.

Be sure to have the fuel rail O-rings replaced (warranty recall) if your in the market for a used LHS.
