            Alright, short and sweet.. Buying a Saturn is a good gauge on the ego.  I am on my second SL, and it will be my last.  Why?  It has nothing to do with the quality of the car.  My first Saturn got me 90,000 miles with absolutely ZERO problems.. My second and present Saturn has 65,000 and as of yet, ZERO problems. I highly recommend this car to any low-income/student/frugle (sp?) individual... Having gone through undergrad/grad school/medical school, I could have asked for no better companion.  Not once did it break down late at night, and not once did my local Saturn dealership fail to notify me of regularly scheduled maintenance.  Only problem... picking up chicks and impressing the fellas it will not.  I realize that is shallow and somewhat callous, however, it's true.  Once again, look above for the recommended purchasers, appreciate how easy it can make your life (especially if it's a busy one)and decide how your ego/personality fit in to a mold of a car...<br><br>
