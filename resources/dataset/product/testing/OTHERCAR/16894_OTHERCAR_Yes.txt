            This is my third Digital Camera and overall, it performs fairly well. It takes good pictures although the 1600x1200 is not quite you are lead to believe. Since the camera uses the floppy disks to record the pictures the  compression that the camera uses reduces the quality and good amount. The  usual picture would be app. 1mb but the compression reduces it to around 300k, so you will get four pictures on one disk. Even when using the 64mb Memory stick, the pictures are compressed.  The memory stick is a great idea, however, it takes an average of at least 10 seconds to record a picture once it is taken. And you can virtually give up on taking pictures of anything that is moving. From the time you press the shutter button  till the picture is recorded is AT LEAST 2 seconds, sometimes more. The bottom line is that Sony could have done much better with a camera of this price range. But, with all of its flaws, the FD95 is still the best Digital camera out there, in my opinion. It has many more features and takes pictures just as good as the other competition with high MP's.
If you are going to buy one, you had might as well go ahead and get the bigger battery also.This camera also will take MPEG movies up to 60 seconds long on a floppy disk.<br><br>
