            Bought a 2000 Intrigue GL and I absolutely love the car. It has near Japanese quality and is much more fun to drive than the Accord and Camry V6 models. So far I have had no problems and the car has a beautiful interior. The 215hp 3.5L twin cam is a sweet engine with very strong passing power. The seats are the best I've seen and the handling is crisp and precise.  If you are in the market for a mid-size sedan, take a look! It's a great alternative to the Accord, Camry and Maxima. I also found the car to carry more value than it's Japanese counterparts.<br><br>
