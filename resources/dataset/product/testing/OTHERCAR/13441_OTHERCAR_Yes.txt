            In 1999, we purchased the 1991 Chevy Blazer. Actually, it's a S-10 Chevy Tahoe Blazer, if you want the specifics. This is the first SUV that we have ever owned, thus we have no others to compare it to for that aspect, but all in all we think it is a great vehicle. 

Our Blazer is the full-size 4 door model. It's very sharp looking, even in it's &quot;old age&quot;. It's also very reliable. In the time we've owned it, it's taken us many miles and we've had to replace very little. Aside from the normal wear and tear and routine maintenance, the alternator is the only thing that has needed to be replaced. Pretty good considering this car has been on the roads since 1991. 

The 4 wheel drive in this Blazer has been very good to us, as well. We know people with Blazer's a lot newer then ours which have problems with the 4 wheel drive option. Ours has never given us trouble, and living in Northern Michigan where the snow gets deep, we're thankful! 

Our Blazer, being full-size, is very roomy. It is meant to seat 5 people, and it does. Besides ourselves in the front bucket seats we have 3 children, 2 of which are in car seats. They fit comfortably in the back seat with minimal hassle getting them in and out. The rear compartment is great for groceries or large purchases. If this isn't enough room, we can always leave the kids with Grandma and lay the back seat down to make even more space. More often then not, though, this back compartment becomes occupied by our 2 dogs. It's the perfect size for 2 large dogs and if you purchase a gate, as we did, you can keep the fur and mud out of the rest of your car's interior. That's worked out really well for our family. 

One problem that we've run into with this car is that the brakes do need replacing more often then our past car. Due to the fact that the Blazer is quite common, at least around here, this keeps the parts from being overly expensive. Our last car was a Cadillac and we found ourselves paying way too much on everything. This Blazer has been quite inexpensive over all. The gas mileage is about as decent as you're going to see in a bigger car, too. If you have a family on a budget, like us, you appreciate the small things like that. 

We fell in love with our Blazer before it left the dealership. My wife just &quot;had&quot; to have it. I am glad that we made the decision to buy it. It's a good car that serves it's purpose and serves it well. We hope it keeps doing so for a few more years, at the least. If it keeps up the good behavior it's been on this far, it definitely should be!
