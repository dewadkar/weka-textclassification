            For better or worse, when one slides up into the seat of the Isuzu Trooper Limited 4x4, subconscious thoughts of ice cream trucks and school buses surface in your mind.  You sit stone upright in the high, firm seat, leaving your legs a straight-down stretch to reach the pedals.  The thin, narrow fold-down armrests on the inboard side of the front driver and passenger chairs hark back to the old "van" days in the seventies.  They seem too narrow to provide good support without your elbow slipping off. You peer out over the flat hood of the Trooper looking downward on the road.  Then you reach down, slide the gear selector into "D", and off you go... ding ding! 

There is an open, airy feeling in the cabin due to the large sections of glass surrounding you and the low center strip console.  The optional jumbo power moonroof opens up to a wide blue sky over both front and rear seats.  This is great on cool autumn days.  The Trooper tries to be unoffensive, seemingly tuned to be as smooth-riding as possible on it's 4WD underpinnings.  This makes for unexpectedly smooth boulevard cruising, although road irregularities do make themselves known.  This is a truck after all. Due to the plush ride tuning, you feel slightly disconnected and buffered from road feedback.  There is negligible "dead" steering on center, and high pitch/roll in the curves. This is expected given the tall, narrow, top-heavy characteristics of this vehicle. 

The upside of this is that you are driving a vehicle with excellent capacity for people and gear.  The Trooper's low load floor, swing-out rear doors, rear step, and boxy compartment shape makes for easy loading and packing.  There is more room in the cargo area behind the rear seat in the Trooper than in just about any other midsize SUV.  This in itself merits purchasing this vehicle for many who don't want the dinosaurs (Expedition, Suburban etc.) and whose families have outgrown the compacts.  

The DOWNSIDE of the setup is that the 3.2 liter V6 is unduly burdened by the weight and mass of this beast.  Acceleration is barely adequate, and you can't help but feel sorry for the little motor that has to pull this brute as it whines and painfully pulls through the gears.  You tend to want to feather-toe the gas whenever possible so as not to bruise the poor widdle weak powerplant and eek out just a little more mileage from your fossil fuels.  Dropping your foot on the throttle is an unpleasant experience, as the motor booms buzzes and thrashes defiantly as it goes about its daunting task.  Considering that this vehicle has such a high profile and is aerodynamically the equivalent of a flying brick, one has to wonder whether the paltry 13 mpg highway average achieved is worth foregoing the larger, V8-powered midsizers such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee which boasts 17 mpg and a 7.5 second 0-60.  

The Limited model as tested comes with such amenities as power heated leather seating with an ingenious "keep warm" feature, selectable transmission settings (winter mode for 2nd gear start in slippery road conditions and a power setting which raises shift points for somewhat better performance), heated power folding outside mirrors, Isuzu premium am/fm/cassette sound with 12-disc CD changer, power "skyroof", fog lights, alloy wheels, chrome trim everywhere, snazzy two-tone accent paint and alloy wheels.  The climate control system is manual, and struggles to cool the vast expanse of cabin area...here is where dual a/c would be very welcome.  Expect passengers in the rear seat to break out in a sweat until the air circulates enough to cool down the cabin...a long wait.  The icing is a nice roof-rack and molded stone/mudguards.  Creature-feature wise, this vehicle comes with just about everything imaginable at its time of manufacture in 1995...and most features seen regularly in luxury vehicles today! 

The deciding factor for many is in the Trooper's sterling reputation for reliability and durability.  Not having to bring your SUV into the shop once a month for repairs is peace of mind enough to convince naysayers to buy into this handsome vehicle.  It has been said that nothing short of a nuclear blast or armageddon could keep a Trooper from reaching its destination.  Although the majority of Trooper Limited owners will never take their vehicles off-road, the knowledge that they have the ability to pilot the truck just about anywhere taking advantage of the manual-transfer 4WD is an ego and confidence booster.  You know, not that you would, but you could. 

In summary and in this reviewer's humble opinion, the 1996 Trooper Limited is a vehicle worthy of considering if you are shopping for a rock-solid few-years-old, low-cost alternative to more pricey Japanese competitors such as the Toyota 4-Runner.  Favorable resale values make the Trooper very attainable currently, although one might be better served to aim just a bit higher...after all, more modern iterations of the now-extinct Trooper feature a much-needed power boost from a beefed up 3.5 version of this venerable powerplant, plus an impressively effective and easy-to-use electronic shift-on-the-fly 4WD transfer called "TORQUE ON DEMAND" which can automatically shift power in slippery situations.  Check out other reviewers' opinions on the 1999 Trooper and judge for yourself.  Otherwise, if you just don't like the svelte swept-back nose style of the newer Trooper, or you think the slower more rudimentary model carries more hardcore appeal or charisma, you really can't go wrong by sticking with this excellent hi-value choice.  Happy motoring!!!
