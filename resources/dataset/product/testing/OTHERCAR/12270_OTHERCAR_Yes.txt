            Bought this car used in 1995 and have put on about 100,000 miles of mixed highway, city driving.

Performance:  Very good.
Acceleration is sprightly and smooth.  Because of the small displacement 2.5L V6, low end torque is only decent.  Handling is good on the stock wheels but as I lucked into some almost new Ronal mags for $125us, the increased offset of the wheels improves handling markedly.  The wider track definitely improved cornering capability and decreased body roll.

Reliability:  Average.
Had some brake problems but they were the fault of the brake shop (Speedy Muffler and Brake).  Discs warped 3 successive times after new pads and disc grind.  New pads installed by another shop have been fine.  Still on original discs after 100,000 miles.  Same for clutch and exhaust system.  Recently replaced igniter, serpentine belt.  Some valve chatter in the mornings, warranty service fixed this twice but problem has returned.  Not a big deal unless the chatter continues after driving, meaning the valves aren't sealing.  Haven't had any trouble with electrical systems.  Parts are quite expensive compared to other Japanese makers.

Exterior.  Average.
Fit and finish is typical Mazda.  Better than American but not as good as Toyota and Honda.  Paint is also typical Mazda, thin.
