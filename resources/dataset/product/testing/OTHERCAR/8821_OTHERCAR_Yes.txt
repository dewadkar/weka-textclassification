            After our family was stuck with the 1991 Accord for a decade, we finally decided that it was time to get a new car.  The choice was not hard: it was going to be either a Camry or an Accord.  After debating for a while, we settled on the Accord.

Now, I don't want to get into all the techs and specs because you can probably find that on the Honda website.  However, I would like to write more on my personal experience, having driven this thing for about a year now.

First, what I really liked about the Honda Accord 2000 is its sleek design.  After having seen it, I just fell in love with it.  The color of the car is green (I don't know the term for such a color--mallard duck green?).  I think that's the best color that goes with an Accord; maybe black comes in a close second (our 1991 model color).  Truly, the Accord looks more like a sports car than your average mid-sized family car.  

What's more, I really get a kick out of revving up the motor when merging to oncoming traffic on the freeway.  The Accord gives me complete control, and I rarely have any problems cutting in front of the guy in the rightmost lane (unless there's traffic).  At times, when you cruise at about 80, you can barely hear the engine.  Maybe that's because the sound of the tires rolling on the asphault overwhelmed it, but even driving in the city exhibits this quiet feature.  

I did not upgrade to leather seats, but the included seats were comfortable enough, although you might get sore after a long drive (5 hours?).  The stereo is also good compared to others that I've had.  In addition, I liked the feature where you have two mileage gauges A and B so that you can track how far you've come on your overall trip, and how far you've come for just today. 

The cruise control is also very easy to use (useful for carpool lanes), and I found the cancel button extremely useful when hitting L.A. traffic.  

All in all, you can't go wrong with the Accord.  If you don't have a lot of cash to spare, but would like a good midsized family car, the Accord is it.  The reason we chose the Accord over the Camry was mainly because of the price.  Just a side note, but I'd rather get the Acura TL 3.2 than the Camry (just a few extra thousand bucks and you get a near-luxury car!).  So far, the Accord ran smoothly for a year without any problems.  The acceleration is average, but maintaining high speeds for L.A. freeway driving is a breeze for the Accord.  It also handles very well when you want to cut off people.  If you're interested in the Accord, don't just look at the Consumer Report Buyer's Guide.  Go to your local dealer and test drive it!  Then, you will see what a fantastic carpet ride it is...

P.S. The Honda Service is also good from our experience of 10 years going in and out of their shops.<br><br>
