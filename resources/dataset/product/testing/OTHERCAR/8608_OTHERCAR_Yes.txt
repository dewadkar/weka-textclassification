            I've owned the 2001 Odyssey LX for about 6 weeks, and am very pleased. The styling is better than any other mini-van I've seen, and it is <b>very</b> roomy. I had very specific needs when I shopped for a van: short enough to fit in the garage, low enough to place a wheelchair ramp on the side door openings, and wide enough side doors to accommodate the width of the wheelchair. I looked at the Mazda MPV, Toyota Sienna, and Ford Windstar.

The Mazda had side doors that were too narrow at the bottom, as the rear wheelwell cuts into the door opening, I was also concerned about the lack of power (160HP vs the Honda's 210) of the ford engine.

The Toyota was borderline on side-door width and seemed a little smaller inside.

After reading about problems with the Windstar's tranny, I ruled that one out.

My dealer had installed leather prior to my seeing the vehicle, so I paid 2K over MSRP with the leather, since I took a white one that was on the lot. I originally thought 2K for leather was steep, but considering that there are 7 seats, and door panels are now leather, it is not that extreme. I was told that if I chose the color, there would be a substantial wait, and I would pay about 2K over MSRP without leather.

I have about 2500 miles now, and am very happy with the van.
acceleration is good, and handling is responsive. Generally, I am a conservative driver, but I had to pass a slow-moving trash-truck and got the RPM up to about 4000,
and was impressed with the punch. Take-off from a dead-stop is not incredible, but satisfactory, once moving though, the power is more than adequate.

The many storage areas are great, and I like all the creature comforts like reading lights for all passengers, sunglasses holder, separate climate controls in the rear, captains chairs in the middle row, and the disappearing third row that doesn't need to be removed when a little extra cargo space is unexpectedly needed.

All of the passengers who have ridden in the back have praised the comfort and roominess.

The only things I have been somewhat disappointed in are: radio quality (OK but not great), and ride on rough surfaces. The suspension is more like a sports car than a luxury car (but it is a van, after all)

One final observation: the gear ratio is great, cruising at 75, the engine is only about 1/3 the way to redline, great for mileage (I am averaging about 23MPG) and helps the engine last longer.

I think it is a great van, and would buy it again!

Note that the only reviewer here who did not recommend the Odyssey (as of 5-21-2001) is a person who does not own it!
(Kinda puzzles me why you would write a negative review on a vehicle you don't own, I'll assume it was sour-grapes)
