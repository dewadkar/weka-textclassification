            The Ion has it all.  It's well-built, drives and handles well, has plenty of room.  I tested compact/sport compact cars from Dodge, Chevrolet, Ford, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Honda, Toyota, and Hyundai before I drove an Ion.  The Ion is so much better than any of the others I couldn't believe it.

The Ion is better made than any of the other domestic offerings and was more pleasant to drive, for me, than any of the imports.  Room in the front is unsurpassed, though the Quad Coupe's rear seat has minimal legroom, even with the front seats pushed forward.  Speaking of the rear seat, I love the Quad Coupe's suicide rear doors.  That's the best feature on a coupe I've ever seen, seriously.  The Ion has a HUGE trunk which can hold tons of groceries and a fold-down rear seat for even more stuff.  If you happen to need to haul some lumber, carpet, or other lengthy item, the passenger seat folds flat to better accommodate cargo eight feet or longer, which is nice.

Now, let's talk about the performance.  My Ion is much quicker than it seems it should be.  Mine has smoked a Cavalier like nothing, outrun a V6 Eclipse, and stayed right alongside an Integra until 90 (I quit).  And, yes, they were trying.  Also, I've heard the Ion is supposed to be limited to 107 MPH, but mine will bury the speedo at 120.  Handling is superb, not like front-wheel drive cars I've had in the past.  I will say that, hands down, the Ion has THE best steering feel of any car I've ever driven.

The biggest con for me is that I don't like the way the power locks are programmed.  The doors automatically unlock when the ignition is shut off, which just doesn't feel safe, especially at night.  Also, when the door is open and you hit the lock button (such as when exiting the car), the doors won't lock for five seconds.  This is a so-called "convenience feature" to give you time to get your key out should you realize you locked it in.  I like my doors to lock when I hit the button, period.  The owner's manual says these features can be disabled, but I have not been able to do it as the manual instructs.  It's really a minor annoyance and easy to get around but I don't like it one bit.

All in all, though, from sales experience to driving pleasure, the Ion is just about the perfect small car.
