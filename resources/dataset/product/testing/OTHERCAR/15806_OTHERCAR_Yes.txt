            I have a 1999 Solara SE V6 Manual with the Toyota 25th Anniversay TRD package.  If you are wondering what this, go to www.trdusa.com and check out the TRD Solara.  That is what my car is.  It was released before the Supercharger was developed so it was not part of the package.  I was looking for a coupe with decent V6 power and a manual transmission.  Well, this criteria excluded a lot of the Solara's competition, such as the Honda Accord Coupe V6 and the Acura 3.0CL.  

I previously owned a 94 Jeep Grand Cherokee with the V8.  While this SUV offer alot more room (which I really didn't need) and more power (which I really liked), it seemed to drain my wallet everytime I had to visit the local gas station.  This made me conclude that this choice of vehicle was much more than I needed.  Thus, the search was on for a more economical, fun, sporty coupe.  My initial choice was the Accord Coupe but I was very disappointed that they did not offer a manual.  The car was nice, it had plenty of power @ 200hp and it handled well, as I expected.  But again the lack of a manual made me make the trip to the Acura dealer.  Again, a manual was not in sight.  Besides that, the car was just plain ugly.  It looked like a very bad attempt in taking the old Accord chassis and throwing a different shell on top of it.  The CL and the Accord I looked at were very well equipped and would be a very good commuter car.  But, I was looking for something more.

At that time, I decided to go to the Toyota dealer to check out this new car named the Solara.  When I arrived, I was very pleased to find that they offered the V6 in a manual.  I decided to test drive this car, it was a SE V6 with a manual.  I thought that the Solara had plenty of power but it lacked the knowledge of how to use it.  It seemed clumsy compared to the handling of the two Honda products.  The suspension seemed to be set up more for luxury than performance.  I can understand this considering that Toyota probably targeted women and older empty nesters.  Please, I don't mean to insult all of you women drivers and my seniors, but let's face it, ladies and the older folks enjoy a softer ride more than the younger gentlemen.  So anyways, aside from the handling and the unfinished exterior look of the SE, the only other complaint that comes to mind is the lame cup holders in the center console.  As usual, all of the interior is ergonomically sound and the powertrain seems to be flawless.  Being a little disappointed in the vehicle that I was probably going to purchase, I exited the test drive vehicle to see the car that I had to have, the TRD Solara.  There it stood in the showroom with the body kit, performance suspension, aggressive wheel/tire package, exhaust, an the rest.  I have found the one.

I had to drive it.  This car addressed all of the minor flaws of the stock Solara.  From the moment I shift the TRD short throw shifter in first gear to when I took an aggressive entry into a turn, this car executed everything perfectly.  It drove like a car that had a sticker price $10K+ higher.  The TRD Exhaust made beautiful sounds as I raced on the freeway.  The ride on the TRD suspension and TRD wheel/tire package was comfortable yet firm. Don't get me wrong, it isn't as luxurious as the stock suspension or stiff as an Indy car, but it is one of the best compromises I have ever driven.  For instance, the handling of the new BMW 328ci coupe seems more supple but it can't hold the corner as well.  Of course, I am comparing to the STOCK suspension setup of the Bimmer.  The engine is strong and it just keeps pulling until you let up.

This is actually a quite large car.  It's kind of deceptive but the interior seats 4 adults more comforably (and with more leg room) than my old Grand Cherokee).

Since I had the car, it hasn't been all a bed of roses of course.  I have had some minor problems being the first production year vehicle and all.  For instance, the CD player skips more than I think it should,  the door trim broke where the window hits it, the upgraded TRD struts had to be replaced, and probably a few that I can't think of right now.  But the dealer was more than happy to give me excellent service in correcting all of these faults.  I also wished that more aftermarket tuners would make parts for this car.  Only company serious is TRD.  I have been looking for an intake system and haven't found one yet.

The stock Solara is a great all-around car that excels in everything that Toyota intended to do.  But the TRD version is a real kick in the pants for somebody willing to give up some ride cushiness to drive a real fun sports coupe.  By the way, I still get complements on how nice the car looks.<br><br>
