            I decided to buy a digital camera in Summer 2001. I was looking for a model with a 2-3 megapixel capacity and optical zoom, made by a respectable company like Nikon, Kodak or Canon. When I saw this new Canon A20 and I found that it costed below $400 I quickly studied the specification and bought it.

After few months of using it I can say that it was a perfect choice. I only had to supplement originally provided 8MB memory card with a 32 MB module, which with now bottom-low chip prices was very easy. I also bought a battery charger in order to save some money on the quickly draining batteries (it also depends on type and brand of the cells). This last consideration could lead me to buying a nikon 775 instead, but it was not available at the time of my purchase, so I did not have a problem of choice.Now it would be a harder decision since the new nikon 775 is very nice and comes with the chargeable battery.

The best thing about canon is the picture quality. Even with medium quality settings it is much better than the scanned pictures coming out of an analog camera. A nice feature is the photo stitch - a software -based merging serial pictures to make a panoramic one.
