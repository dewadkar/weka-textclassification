            Having spent many days surfing the brickboard website, it has become painfully obvious that most Volvo owners are incredibly biased. They either flat out hate &#145em or they love &#145em like a child.

I have been a Toyota man all of my life (Supra, Camry, MR2, Celica, etc.) so I come into this Volvo thing rather unbiased and hopefully my report will reflect that. So why did I switch to a Volvo? Two words: Swedish Steel. I thought that my precious cargo (wife and two boys) would be safer.

We own a 2000 Volvo V40. It&#146s a very sharp looking mini-station wagon, white, with 30K miles on it.

The car in general: it has a pretty zippy little motor (ur, engine, motors are electrical) that provides fairly brisk acceleration. Handling is decent, but can get sloppy in corners. The OEM Michelins wore out at about 22K. Yes, I rotate and balance every 7500 miles and ALWAYS check to make sure they are properly inflated. The brakes. Oh yeah, the brakes. They&#146re awesome, but the must be made of paper because they wore out after 25K miles. And dirty! After a good car wash expect to see brake dust immediately on your beautiful wheels. The cabin feels fairly cramped, at least compared to our 93 Camry. Two car seats for our boys pretty well takes up all of the space in the back seat.

Gas Mileage: expect about 21-23 mpg in suburban traffic and we&#146ve been averaging about 27mpg on the highway (Summer with A/C) and 29 mpg otherwise.

Safety:  my wife has had two minor accidents in the car. The last wreck, in which a car sideswiped her, caused some pretty extensive damage to the driver&#146s side of the car. All three of them walked away from the accident w/o a scratch. Big positive! Reconfirms my decision to buy the Swedish Steel. I understand that the V40 has all of the same features of the S90 (side air bags, front air bags, ABS brakes, etc.).

Parting Thoughts: Ok, so why do I question Volvo for life? Well, our brakes wore out quickly, we&#146ve had to have suspension adjustments, we&#146ve had a broken motor mount, we&#146ve gone through half a dozen headlights, etc. I honestly think this is a cheaply made car. I&#146ve done more work to this car, and paid more to maintain this car, in it&#146s first 30K miles than I did in 100K miles in our Camry. We paid $23K for it w/o any options. If you purchase a fair number of options you can EASILY expect to pay $30 K for the V40. I simply think you can do better. One final note. If you're looking to buy a Volvo and live in North Alabama or Southern Tenn., try Century Volvo. These are some of the best people to work with. Period.

A safe, decent car w/o the bells and whistles, but fairly high maintenance. If you want more options, look elsewhere.
