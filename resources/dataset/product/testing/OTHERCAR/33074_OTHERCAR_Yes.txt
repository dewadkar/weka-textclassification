            I wanted a pickup that was easy for my wife to drive &amp; park as well as one that looks good. I have a 99 Ext Cab 2 Wheel drive Stepside 3rd door. I love the third door but wish there was two seats in the rear. The one seat works ok if only one of the grandkids wants to go with us there is a seatbelt on the front seat but there feet are on or at the cup holder. Mine is a little stiff on the ride as I have the heavy duty springs but put a little weight in the back or hook a trailer on &amp; the ride is great. One thing about it you can haul a load! The stepside box doesn't have a hitch  in the bumper so have to add a frame hitch. The up side to that is that it is better than the bumper hitch. As for the drive it is a joy on long trips it is more comfortable than our mid size car. With the V6 there is a lot of power I was told that the 4 cyl would be under powered for what I want to do with a pickup. Anyone that wants a good looking pickup for in town &amp; on the road that is easy to park &amp; not as apt to get parking lot hickies as a wider pickup. This is a half ton pickup so if you want to or have to haul big loads you better get one with the GVW you need. It is a great pickup for me! My folks have a 96 4X4 &amp; love it also they only use there car if they have to have room for more people.<br><br>
