            The first time I drove this car I was reminded of the immortal words of Ferris Bueller when he said, &quot;If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.&quot;  That said, I want to warn you that this car 1) wasn't mine, and 2) forced me into sheer awe.  I am still a learning driver.  Over the holidays my family went down south to visit my uncle. When he learned that I had not put in enough driving time to feel comfortable he announced that I was now going to.  I was alright when I thought I would be driving my car, a 1987 Subaru wagon, but I was wrong.  I was to drive my aunt's brand new Lincoln Navigator. The huge, highly expensive, and fantastically luxurious automobile resting in the driving. &quot;Oh damn&quot; was all that went through my head as I dutifully mounted to the driver's seat and adjust it for my tiny (5'4&quot;) frame.  Once settled I began to pull out, only to discover that this huge car drove like a sedan!  It was mind bending.  Slowly we pulled out onto one of the main roads of Virginia Beach, and we were off!  Eventually my uncle was heard to say things like, &quot;you are the biggest car in the road, they'll all yield to you!&quot; and he was right.  
Driving a Navigator is far more than a trip, it is an adventure, an experience.  The ride is smoooth, for everyone, including those in the backseat, and you have no fear for your own life, as you are much higher up than anyone else, and in a vastly superior vehicle.  
All in all the Navigator is the pinnacle of the driving experience, but sadly folks, it's priced that way.  <br><br>
