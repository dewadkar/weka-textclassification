            I considered <b>Honda Accord</b> among others when I was shopping for a car. From what I read in �Car and Driver�, it was a good choice - reliable, fun to drive, but relatively expensive in comparison to competition.

I went to test drive one over the weekend. I wanted manual gearbox, LX trim (which has 2.3-liter 150 hp inline four), coupe form � although coupe is not as practical a sedan, it was supposed to be a bit cheaper (I thought) and looks much better.

The dealership had dark blue metallic (almost black) Accord, that looked nice on the outside, had stick shift and was an LX trim.

Prior to that I test-drove Ford Mustang 3.8L Coupe (as you can see from my review of it) and was disappointed. Although, considering price and value the Ford was a good choice, other aspects were disappointing.

First, I noticed Accord�s ugly gray interior. I understand that interior color depends on exterior color, so by choosing another exterior color I would be able to get nice looking dash and seats.

The 4-cylinder engine is so smooth and quiet at idle, I tried to start the car again while it was already running. The A/C worked well, and both clutch and shifter were superb, unlike Mustang�s clutch, which I didn�t like at all.

The acceleration is smooth and reasonably quick. Accord, subjectively feels no slower than Mustang and has better suspension and very good brakes. Unfortunately, it was not �a company policy� to let me go on the freeway, the dealer said.

Then the guy told me that Accord coupes cost more than sedans, and wanted more than I could pay for a 6-cylinder Mitsubishi Galant, which seemed unreasonable. I realize that Galant is not as reliable as Accord and does not allow you to have stick shift (it has automatic transmission as standard equipment), but it looks better, costs significantly less and has more standard equipment.

The funny part is when I tried to negotiate better price for Accord, the dealer said that ��it�s not about money, I want to be your friend.� At which point I decided to go home. Good thing he was polite, unlike the guy from the Ford dealership I went before that, who was downright rude.

<b> Likes</b>

1. Smooth engine � quiet, refined and fuel-efficient. It employs variable valve timing and lift and pools nice.

2. Good manual transmission and clutch that�s easy to modulate.

3. Safety, which is above average, according to crashtest.com.

4. Reliability, which rivals Camry and Maxima, according to �Consumer Reports".

5. Rear-end styling and interior design, small steering wheel.

6. Good suspension.

7. Excellent fit and finish.

<b>Dislikes</b>

1. Price � the car seems overpriced comparing to several other competitors.

2. Front-end styling and the fact that almost everyone drives Accords.

3. Some road noise from the tires.

4. Interior color on the particular car I drove.

5. Low level of standard equipment for the money.

Of course, the major turnoff was the value/price ratio in conjunction with styling (or rather the fact that everyone drives Accords now). So I didn�t buy Accord and have no regrets. I know it�s reliable and refined, has good fit and finish, but this wasn�t my main objective.

Considering that I mostly looked for the car with good safety, looks, reliability and price, I started to look at and later bought Mitsubishi Galant. Although it is supposed to be less reliable and dealer�s service department doesn�t know if the car has the cabin air filter (it does) and where it�s located, it has better, distinctive styling, costs less and has higher level of standard equipment.

But if I could disregard the price, I would probably buy Accord. If the price and value for money does not concern you, Accord might be a good choice.
