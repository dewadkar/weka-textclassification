            This car is a lot of fun.  I bought it for a nice ride, but it unexpectedly changed my approach to driving from transportation to an enthusiasm.  To start, it made me want to be a better driver.  A month after buying it I attended a Skip Barber driving school and since then I have been to a couple more sponsored by the local BMW Club.  The latter actually let me take the 540 on a track and explore its capabilities. I liked the car when I bought it and I admire it even more with a little knowledge about how to use its awesome power safely.

After 3 happy ownership experiences with Mercedes-Benz sedans, I was so disappointed with the yacht-like handling of the E430 I traded quickly for a 540i 6-speed manual.  What a revelation!  The sense in the seat of your pants that you know exactly what the car is doing is like my 80s Benzes only much more refined.

The car goes like stink; I can only imagine what another 100 hp in the M5 would be like!  The brakes are remarkable for their grip, fade-resistance and road feel.  The clutch has a learning curve with the 1st to 2nd gear transition particularly difficult to execute smoothly.  Pedals are well placed for heel-and-toe downshifts.

The optional front comfort seats are a dream; the electric articulated upper backrest adjustment should be on every car.  The heated steering wheel is a thoughtful touch.

My two reservations switching from MB to BMW were winter driving (my E430 was a 4-Matic) and reliability.  Happily, neither has been a problem.  The traction system works well though you have to switch it off when seriously stuck in snow or on ice.  Snow tires and a second set of alloy rims are an expensive necessity in snowy climes. My 540 has been as reliable as a Mercedes, which I consider high praise - the single fault, a power window switch, was fixed in a 30-minute visit to the dealer.

Who shouldn't buy a 540?  I would only cross-shop the 540 against the Mercedes E430 so comparing the two, the Mercedes E-Class is more spacious, especially in the back seat.  I think the Benz is a better-looking car too, especially inside.  If those things matter more than stunning handling and a manual transmission, the Benz may be a better choice.

As for the 540, it's expensive, it drinks like a fish, the cup holders are a joke and I am not sure it will hold resale value like a Benz, but if I were going to replace it, I would go or another 540... or an M5.
