            Well I own a 1995 Mpv For about 7 years it had 250,000 miles on it and ran flawless,to it's last breath. When it quit on me I went straight to the local dealership and brought a new 2002 model. There has been alot of  talk about how the older model was under power with only 160hp, so make sure you get the 2002 model. Mines came with the luxury package with 6 disc indash changer which is great, because you can change cd while still driving though not recomemed by highway officials. Power seats, 16 inch alloy wheels, Two thats right count'em two a/c which is great since I live in california, which is 100 degrees today and other nicknats like floormats and side seat table.
      I was really impress with the test drive. The supension was smooth, making little bumps in the road feel flat, yet quite capable when asked to make high speed turns to the freeway on ramp, with little body rool. The visiable is great all around, and the 200hp motor makes sure you get to cruising speed in no time. But there are some flaws that escape Mazda engineers. Like the hi wind nosie when crusing on the freeway the cabin is not necassary libary quiet, and the use of drum brakes in the rear makes stopping a little longer than it need be

   The greatest feature on this minivan is the two middle seats. Don't like who your sitting next to? No problem simply lift the right lever bar and change from a bench seat to two separate captains chairs. The rear seats can also disappear with two quick pull of the straps located behind the seats, making room for all kinds of gear.

     This van is a great deal compare to the more expensive Honda Oydssey. The LX model came with an Msrp of about $22,250 after the luxury package and delivery charges it came out to about $25,010. After about one hour of haggling I got the price down to $22,300 with tax, and licensing the out the door price was $24,700 with a full tank of gas?
