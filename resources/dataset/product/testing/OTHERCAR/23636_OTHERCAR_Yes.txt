            Jeeps are built tough because they have to be able to survive todays' world.  I'm an EMT for an ambulance company out of CA. I've seen a lot of accidents involving SUV's and most of them didn't end of good terms, except for the ones' that a Wrangler was involved in and here's a story to back up my statement.
   A friend of mine was driving down a ocean bluff road one night in his 96 Jeep Wrangler when he came upon a fairly sharp turn in the road. The semi-truck in front of him went on the shoulder a bit to make the turn easier and my friend followed suit, what he wasn't expecting was a rock in the shoulder sticking up about 7&quot;.  As he hit this rock at 45 it pushed his suspension in and popped it back out with such force to flip and roll the Jeep 3 times. He landed upside down on the rollcage and if that wasn't enough was then struck by on oncoming VW Bug on the front fender.  My friend was UNHARMED, the standard roll cage in this vehicle saved his life and he came out without even a cut.  But that's not the end of this story. The poor Jeep that had been flipped, rolled and then hit head on by a Bug looked bad real bad.  The tow truck came and my friend helped the driver flip his poor Jeep back on the wheels, then the driver climbed into the drivers seat and turned the key and the Jeep started. Even after all it went though the Jeep still started and was driven up onto the tow truck.
    In my opinion these vehicles are amazing, and built extremely tough for an extremely tough world.
