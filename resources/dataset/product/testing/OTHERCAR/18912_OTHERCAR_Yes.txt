            I currently own a 93 model Jeep Grand Cherokee.  When I wrecked my previous vehicle a had to find a way to get to college and back.  Being a college student my budget was limited, but I wanted a new automobile that didn't look like a clunker.  After shopping for a week I came across my Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Immediately I assumed it was out of my price range.  However, the mileage brought the price down considerably, and I bought that Jeep.  It now has 140,000 + miles on it and is running fine.  The only problem I have had with mine is broken belt in the engine.  I have driven several different types of SUV's and vans.  I feel that none of the competitors vehicles ride as heavy.  I am by far not an expert, but some say the heavy ride is due to iron engine block, while competitors have gone to the lighter aluminum engine blocks Jeep has kept the cheaper, easier maintained iron engine.
Please understand that all this information is based on the 93 model Jeep.  If this information has changed I am not aware of it.
