            I'm writing from Australia, big country similiar to Canada. Needed a fast, safe, reliable, luxurious, comfortable, not-too-expensive family Car. My solution : '95 Volvo 850 T5. Nothing else on the used-car market in Aus compared for the price. It's the car I jump out of bed for in the mornings, eager to rev up and get on to the highway to work, about 18 kms journey. Not to mention weekends away where the huge boot has plenty of space, the engine willingly pulls uphill, and can cater for 5 adults with luggage ! Comfort - beautifully comfortable leather seats, enough space all-round esp head space. Saftey - Volvo cant be beat, SIPS, ABS, traction etc, also no-one else has an integrated child seat, a big bonus for my 5 year old. No lugging around those ugly 'child booster seats'. Only downside - servicing turbos can be relatively costly, (every 5000 kms) as well as those sports tyres. Also handling could be improved as it feels little roly-poly around tight bends (my previous car, Honda Accord, had better handling with a double-wishbone susp). But I have been throughly rewarded with a great car and driving experience ! I'll be upgrading to the C70 coupe as soon as I save up the dough.. <br><br>
