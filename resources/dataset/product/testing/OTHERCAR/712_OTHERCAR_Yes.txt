In April, 1999, Nikon started distribution of their new digital camera the Coolpix 950. I thought it might be a &quot;next generation&quot; in digital cameras from Nikon. I thought it might be an upgrade of the Olympus 600 series or a next step up from the Nikon Coolpix 900 or 900s. Wrong Batman! It is an entirely new camera with features much like a SLR camera. Metal construction and a red racing strip rubber grip tells me that its a Nikon. 3X optical zoom Nikkor lens tells me its a Nikon.

The cool news is that its a 2.11 Megapixell image, BIG for such a small cheep camera (MSR $999). Additionally, the images can be saved in an uncompressed TIFF format plus three JPEG compression modes as well. Boot up time is a fast 2 seconds and there are three resolutions to pick from ..... 1600 X 1200, 1024 X 768 and VGA (640 X 480 .... great for Web publication). All this plus tons of real photography features like automatic shutter and aperture priority, auto focus, metrix metering ..... the list goes on and on and on .... But the really cool feature is the Best Shot Selector .... which Nikon says is an exclusive ..... Here is how I used the Best Shot Selector: When taking a picture you are bound to move a little. I move a lot and my 10 year old .... well he is 10, say no more. With the Nikon Best Shot you can select this feature and the Coolpix 950 will instantly take five frames, determine which is the sharpest, save it and delete the others! Both my son and I got some good to great pictures using this feature. Thank You, Nikon.

If you don't have a digital camera yet, this is the one to buy. It has all the stuff you need in a camera ..... automatic mode for the &quot;point &amp; shoot&quot; memories or manual if you want to get &quot;professional&quot;.<p>
