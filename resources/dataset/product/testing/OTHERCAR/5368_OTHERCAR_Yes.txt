            My husband and I were in college when we bought our 1994 Nissan Sentra and we were sick of fixing our old beaters.  We tried out about five cars, but none of them felt as solid as the Sentra, and none of them had the reliability-factor that Nissan has.  My mom has owned about 4 Nissans and has never had any problems with any of them (except she said that the Pulsar NX was pretty darned whimpy).  The Sentra was also named car of the year I think back in 1992 and they didn't change the style of it until 1995.  Back when we were buying our Sentra, they were really in high demand and, therefore, kept their value.  Our Sentra, even with over 100,000 miles on it, is worth over $6,000 and we only bought it for $9,000.  We have never had any real problems with our little car.  The only problem that we have had is that our air conditioner and heater only work on high.  Everything else has been perfect.  The gas mileage is incredible (up to 35 mpg) and the car is pretty peppy (I never worry about reaching speed as I'm merging on the freeway).  We didn't opt for many extras (we have the XE), and the thing that I think is most annoying about this car is the semi-automatic seat belts.  You have to lift these belts up as you get into your seat and out of your seat.  If you forget and happen to unbuckle the seatbelt, they are attached to the door and are likely to be shut in the door after you get out.  The back seats aren't terribly roomy, but we also didn't get a 4-door, so most people don't expect too much room in the back.  The ride is pretty smooth, although a little noisy compared to our Toyota Sienna (which is dead quiet).  Overall, I love my little Sentra and I would recommend Nissan and their vehicles to anyone.  The only reason I didn't buy a Nissan van last year was because they didn't have the 4-doors out yet.  So if you're looking for a used car, you'll be very happy with the Nissan Sentra's reliability, pep, and gas mileage.<br><br>
