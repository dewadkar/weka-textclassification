            You know, it started out to be so exciting - got the camera and immediately started shooting after a short set-up. Quickly used up the frames on the digital camera and then tried to upload into the computer so I could have more use from the camera. There was no response from the software, my pictures weren't being taken off the camera, and it sits now with NO use until I somehow find the potential hours it will take to figure out the problem, call the manufacturer, go through their troubleshooting suggestions (Yes, I went through everything that their &quot;instructions&quot; said to do, but they were very limited - VERY limited.)

As far as the clarity of the pictures (I could only view them through the camera) the color was BEAUTIFUL and close-ups and wider range was done too. There is a hang-up about &quot;save&quot; and &quot;delete&quot; (the latter is too easy to do)and in trying to get my first batch of pictures into the computer, I accidentally deleted EVERYTHING.

See why I'm miffed? My camera has only had one outing and it's sat on my desk for two months...<br><br>
