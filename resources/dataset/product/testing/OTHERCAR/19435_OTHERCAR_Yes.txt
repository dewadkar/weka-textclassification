            I started looking for a larger car about a year after my daughter was born in '97. I was driving a Civic HB and had had no trouble with it for over 50,000 miles. So I took a look at what Honda had to offer. The Accord was nice but didn't offer the cargo room necessary for hauling around a families' gear. The Odyssey had the space but was out of uor price range. Then I looked at the CR-V. The '98 I test drove had good room and a nice set of features but didn't impress me when I drove it. It handled fine, was smooth and comfortable, but didn't have anything that stood out and made me want to buy it. So we put our car buying on hold. I used the time to do more shopping and everything I looked at just pointed me back to the CR-V as the best buy for the money. It is the only small SUV with a real back seat. Honda then did bumped up the power for '99 and I drove it again. This time I liked it. All of the features I liked before were there along with a peppier engine and respectable mileage. I wasn't in the market for an SUV and still don't consider the CR-V to fit wholly into that group. It is a hybrid that fits my families and my needs very well. Drives on the road like a car, has higher seating for a good view of the road, and all wheel drive traction for when things get slippery. Performance in the snow is very good. To put it simply, you don't get stuck in the snow. <br><br>
