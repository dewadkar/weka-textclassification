            This is a CarUV! I mash the accelerator, the tires let out an
immense camaro-like screech and im off 0-60 in 8.5 seconds!!!
The ECT Tranny can changed to SNOW or Power mode. I prefer POWER.
Rev the 3.0L engine up and the car revs to a near 7,000 rpms. the sound of the engine is a ghostly zap on top of a pulsating vrooom! type of sound. Cornering is great, but you dont feel to close to the road. so its got SUV steering,  Car ride and power - and LEXUS everything else. its a good buy if you dont like the mercedes ml320.<br><br>
