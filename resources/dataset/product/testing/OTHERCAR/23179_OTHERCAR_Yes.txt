                 I had a honda accord before my current car.  The only reason i don't have the car anymore is a car accident where the car was totaled but everyone in the car came out unscratched.  Wether u r looking for a family car or a car to modify for import performance this car is ideal.  the car lacks in power in stock form but minor mods such as intake and exaust make a rather big difference.  
     It seats 5 comfortably for the family people out there. With both driver an passenger side airbags make this car a safe car for family driving.  Kids should not sit in the front seat though cause of injeries that can be caused from passenger side air bags.
     If u r the inport performance nut as i am there is a wide varity of aftermarket parts avalible for the accord such as exaust, pillies, turbo kits, body kits, and many other.  Although this car does not have the potential of the civic it makes for a great touring style car and looks great when presented correctly 
     In closing i think this car is all around good.  I would recomend this car to anyone who is looking for a midsize affordable car. <br><br>
