               I went to the lot and saw this thing.  I new I had to have it.  The sleek styling, the sexy lines, the low-profile tires....It was so cool!  I talked to a salesman about the car, he told me all the mumbo-jumbo about how it was reviewed by Car-and-Drive, Road-and-Track, and Autoweek.  They all gave rave reviews, and for a good reason!  During the test drive I noticed how the car handled better than my father's BMW 328, and accelerated almost as fast even though it is only an automatic and the 328 is a manual.  

     From the heated seats to the super quiet riding, the car screams luxury.  I now realize why it is also considered a luxury car.  This car is as smooth as silk, like riding a cloud.  The sound system is great, and the 6 disk changer in the dash is very convenient.  It takes up less space than the in-glove-compartment style of the older Lexus's. The looks of the car also burst out with sport styling.  The low front and raised rear resembling a Jetta Mercedes blend looks great.  Tail lights on this car are very cool and modern. The steel pedals and chrome shift knob are very slick looking.

     One feature I really like is the manual option.  You can shift into manual and use buttons on the steering wheel to shift up and down.  It is great for passing a big truck on the highway.  Just down shift and get that amazing power, blow by the truck, and shift back into normal gears.  Also, it provides for an amazingly fun trip through back roads.  Very reminiscent of rally car racing.  You can shift up and down while coming in and out of turns, with the trees around you looking like a blur of green and brown.

     The turn radius is outstanding, and it stops on a dime.  The one thing I am still getting used to is the light gas pressure required.  Barely touch the pedal and it jumps.  All in all, the car is quiet, fast, and a blast to drive!
