                  My parents bought this camera because they wanted one that they could send pictures through e-mail. Also they have a website for property that they own, and now with this great camera they can put pictures of their property on there website. Being new to the new digital cameras, this one made it very easy to learn and operate. 

     One of their favorite features on this camera is the ease of storing your pictures. This camera uses a floppy disk to store all of your pictures you take. Now you don't have to spend $7.00 on a role of film, but instead you can spend the $7.00 on buy 100 floppy disks, which each disk holds about 20 images. Also you don't have to pay to have film developed. With the floppy disk all you have to do is pop it into your computer and the image shows up crystal clear. Now you can send your pictures via e-mail, put them on websites, or if you have a picture of your family, you can set that as your wallpaper on your computer. You can also print it out on your printer. 

     The battery is a great feature on the camera. It can be plugged into any outlet, or into your car cigarette lighter. My family took this camera on a one month vacation around the mid-west. It held up better than our 35mm camera. It took twice the pictures, with better quality, and we didn't have to buy 3 sets of batteries like we had to for the 35mm one. All we did was charge the battery the night before and it was ready to go all day. This was a handy little camera to have around on the vacation. 

     The operation of this camera was very simple. My dad read the directions once through very quickly and I learned to use the camera instantly. Their 10 year old son, my borther, learned to use it better than my dad,and he didn't even read the directions. This camera can be used by anyone instantly. 

     If you are looking for a camera to put pictures on a website or send via e-mail, then this is the one for you. The picture quality is great for that kind of usage. but as far as using it to print out the quality is so-so. It's still a great little camera. It is totally worth every penny too. <br><br>
