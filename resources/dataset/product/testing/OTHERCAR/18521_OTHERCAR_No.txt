            Thinking about a digital camera?

I compared many different models before buying this one.  Most all of my colleagues use digital cameras in their work.   I used the Nikon Coolpix 950, the Kodak DC260 but wanted a camera I could take with me on vacations without worrying about trashing my investment.  So, how does the MX-600 Zoom stack up?

First, the good.  Outdoor photographs are truly stunning.  Even more surprising, the more color you through at it the better.  Your wife in front of the flowers at Longwood gardens, Bring it on.  Want to take a macro photo of that incredible orchid? No problem.  Photos in bright outdoor light produce perfect colors that print on the Stylus Photo 750 clearer than a point and shoot 35mm camera.  The 3x optical zoom really lets you frame your subject on the digital media.

Next, the bad.  The exposure time on this baby in anything other than bright light is painful.  Can you hold yourself completely still for 2 seconds.  It's not as easy as you might think.  The flash supplied with the camera can only fill for ~ 5 meters/15 feet. The automatic settings also can't figure out the white balance, a typical problem for digital cameras.

Overall, this camera has replaced my 35mm  for trips.  For intensive indoor shooting, this camera can't stack up against the competition.<br><br>
