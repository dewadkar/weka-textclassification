            This truck far surpasses the Ford F150 I was driving prior to it's purchase. I purchased this truck to accommodate pulling a 3,000 pound horse trailer that when loaded ranged from 4,000 to 8,000 pounds gross weight.

The Ram 2500 handles this trailer like it wasn't even there. The power of the Cummings Diesel smoothly accelerates the rig to cruising speeds with no hesitation and only seems to work hard on the steepest of inclines.

I also use this truck exclusively on my 40 mile commute to and from work. Like all trucks with a heavy duty suspension you do feel the road, but the 40/20/40 front seat in this cab smoothened all but the harshest bumps. I find the ride quite acceptable.

The biggest thing that I love about this truck is that I get right at 20 miles per gal from the Cummings engine. (To date with 84,000 miles it's exactly 19.73 MPG) That average includes several thousand towing miles as well as city and highway driving.

I recommend this Truck to anyone that needs to do a lot of traveling with large loads or towing needs.<br><br>
