            (7/8/00) General Comments from using it on a long trip.
It's so small and light that it's amazing,  yet it's very easy to use and the pictures are really great.  I found the 1200x1600 Fine to be a good mode.  The quality is there and you can still take a lot of pictures.  However,  to really enjoy the camera (i.e take lots of pictures),  you will have to buy more memory.  At this mode , 8M (comes with camera) is only about 12 pictures, and thats pretty lame.  32M,($75) = ~ 52 Pictures I bought 128M ($225) &gt; 200 pictures,  which is probaby the right amount, because with digital cameras, you tend to take a lot of photos.  An extra rechargeable battery is also a good idea ($50).  The battery lasts for a while, especially if you use the standard view finder (as opposed to the LCD).  However,  one of the best features of a Digital camera is the fact that you can instantly review the pictures you just took (and check that they are good).  This is really a neat thing to do and a great benefit.  But, suprisingly...  this requires using the LCD screen, and this drains the battery.  The battery will still for a while, but if you want to be safe, it's nice to have an extra one. They are small and not really that expensive, so it's well worth it.  A nice small case, (which for some very strange reason doesn't come with the camera, even though the LCD screen is fragile) can be bought for about $15,  and is also worth it.  Bottom line, This is a fantastic camera, but you should take into account some extra accessories if you want to make full use of it.

What I liked:
� Size - 3.4 x 2.2 x 1.1inches,  you have to see it to believe it.  Smaller then a cassette tape, and about 3 cassettes thick. 
� Comes with rechargeable battery + charger-   Although if you want to be safe,  having an extra one wouldn�t hurt, it�s lasts for a while  but not forever. 
� 2.1 mega pixel - There are cameras with more,  but this is pretty impressive and probably good enough for most
� Comes with easy to use and fully featured software
� Nice LCD display and you can also use the regular view finder on sunny days or to conserve battery power. 
� Very ease to use,  simple and mostly intuitive controls with many nice features (see www.powershot.com)
� 2 X optical Zoom + 4 X digital Zoom.
� Easy to connect to PC (supplied USB cable) and TV (TV out cable) 
� Very nice case and general appearance.  Has a solid quality feel to it. 


What I liked less:
� Supports  1600x1200 Super fine,  1600x1200 Fine and 640x480 fine sizes.  800x600 would have been nice to have instead  of 640x480. 
� No battery level indicator,  only warns you when it�s almost empty.
� Comes with 8Mb Flash memory.  Realistically,  you will need at least 32Mb (which you can buy separately for $75-100).  Remember with digital pictures,  you tend to take many more pictures then with film.
� Doesn�t come with any sort of carrying case,  you can order an optional soft leather one for ~ $20,  but its hard to understand why don�t give you one,  it�s not like the LCD doesn�t need some protection. 
� Only supports   Compact Flash Type I card,  not the end of the world,  but the miniture IBM Disc drive only works on CF type 2 (at least for now)
� Pictures are a bit on the dark side, sometimes 
� Doesn�t support using regular batteries in case you run out on the rechargeable

Bottom line:
The ultimate portable digital camera,  with all the features you need unless you are a professional. If you liked the Elph,  you'll love this camera.
