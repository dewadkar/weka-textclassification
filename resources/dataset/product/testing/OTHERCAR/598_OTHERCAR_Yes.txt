<TEXT>
            I bought a 1993 Suzuki Swift a year and a half ago    with 82000 miles on it because it was a 5 speed and a small car and I thought it would be great on gas.     Since I travel 40 miles one way to work gas mileage was a big factor. Since the day I bought it the only money I have put into it is for tires.                        Here is where the BUT comes in. I live in New England and this car will not move in the snow. It just spins it's wheels. Everyone tells me it is probably too light and that is why it has no traction in the wet weather. If it wasn't for that factor I would say that it is one of the best used cars I have ever had. When I am ready to buy another vehicle Suzuki will be the first dealer I will visit but I will only look at 4 wheel vehicles.<br><br>
