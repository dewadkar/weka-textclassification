            OK, so maybe that statement is a little strong when describing a Saturn. Sure they aren't the most cutting edge manufacturer when it comes to design. Sure they can get a little hokey with the &quot;Saturn Family&quot; stuff. But when it comes right down to it, Saturn builds a fine little sedan for a good price
and most important of all...no pressure. 

That's right, this is the car for folks like me who find dealing with the whole auto sales establishment a tad unpleasant. OK, I actually find it akin to have rusty nails driven through the sides of my head with a rubber mallet. I hate car salesmen and I hate sale managers and I hate spending 6 hours negotiating the price for my new car. I have put up with it in the past because frankly I didn't see another way. When I purchased my latest new car, I happened to wander in to my local Saturn dealer. Lo and behold, no sales pressure! 

That alone would have been enough to sell me on the car, but I can understand that some of you out there are actually concerned about things like price and dependability and style. Not to worry, the SL delivers on all counts. I bought a fully loaded SL1 with a 100HP engine, automatic transmission, power moon roof, cruise control, AC and power windows and doors for around $16,000. The ride is smooth and you can really tell that some thought has been put into the design. I've noticed that everything is right where it ought to be. When I reach for the heat or AC or window controls they are right where I expect them. That's called ergonomics folks and it makes all the difference in the world.

In closing, let me just say that if you are looking for a comfortable, good looking sedan, you need look no further than the Saturn SL series.<br><br>
