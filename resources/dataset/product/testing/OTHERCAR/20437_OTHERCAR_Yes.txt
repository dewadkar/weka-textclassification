            <i>This opinion is for the Jetta GLX model.  Some features will not be found on the GLS or GL.</i>

Let me just start off by saying that this car is so fun to drive!  That is probably the reason I get poor gas mileage.  It has power and agility for a car of its class.

Anyway, getting down to business:

<b>Gas Mileage</b>
The car runs about 22 to 21 mpg on average for me.  I drive 90% highway so I would expect higher.  Even when I tried to drive with most of the lead removed from my foot, I only managed to squeeze 24 mpg.  This combined with the relatively small gas tank (about 14 gallons), means frequent fill-ups.

<b>Features</b>
I am a gadget lover!  I like all the little features some cars offer.  This car blew my mind with all the nice touches they put in.  I am still finding out things to this day!!  I'll name a few of the lesser known items since the VW web-site clearly lists the other.

- Impossible to lock yourself out of car (or difficult I should say)

- Alarm warning after about 25 minutes to inform you if the car "just isn't right."  read: your interior lights are on!

- Close the windows and the sunroof using the key in the outside door lock. (Very convenient if you forgot to close your sunroof after you already got out of the car.)

- 10 minutes of power after you shut off the car.

- Hood latch pops out so you don't have to feel around under the hood to get it open.

- Tells you if you left your handbrake on by accident.
- Warns you of icy conditions on the road by sensing temperature.

- Locks the doors automatically

- Reverse assist mirror(passenger mirror adjusts to view the back tire while backing up.)

- Many more I've found and many more I'm sure I haven't found yet.

Of course there are all the others like rain sensing wipers, memory seats, heated seats, trip computer, and more.  Check out the VW site for those details.

<b>Reliability</b>
So far, at 13,500 miles, I haven't had any serious problems.

<b>Fun Factor</b>
Very fun!  I also own a 1987 Corvette and actually missed my Jetta while I was driving the Vette for a week. (I know...boohoo poor me :-) The conveniences in the Jetta are fantastic!

<b>So is there anything bad about it?</b>
Well, I know that sometimes I have trouble pumping gas.  The gas keeps clicking off like it is full.  Something inside the gas tank seems to hit the nozzle and trigger the auto shut off on the pump.  This has happened several times.  I minor annoyance.
Thats about it!
