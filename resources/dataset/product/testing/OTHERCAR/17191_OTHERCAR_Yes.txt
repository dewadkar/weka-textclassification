               I drive this car every day, without fail. I am young and vibrant, and I want an affordable car that reflects the power of youth. The Maxima is this car, it is this youth. The Maxima has an awesome engine, six cylinders of pure power. I drove my friends 3 series BMW the other day, and that engine isn't close to the engine of the Maxima. I could easily beat his car off the line. The acceleration is great and the body style of the older models is great too. The body style says, &quot;Hey I've just got that look in my eye....&quot; It does to the Maxima just has a great look to it. The handling is responsive to the point where the driver feels that he/she is in control of the car no matter what the situation. I do drive my car far too aggressively, but under the stress which I put my car it has performed wonderfully, even after 60,000 miles. The gas mileage is pretty good as well, I usually get near 300 miles before I have to fill up the 16 gallon tank again. The tan leather interior and Bose sound system add an elegant, aristocratic feel to the car. The car is really the perfect mix of class and power. Maximas are easy to become attached to because their owner do see the youth and class and power which they have. This is really just a spectacular car. If you ever get the chance, drive one. <br><br>
