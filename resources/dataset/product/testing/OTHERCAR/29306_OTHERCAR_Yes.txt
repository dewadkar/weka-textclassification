            So its LOUD, and its ROUGH and it gets TERRIBLE MILEAGE and it cost some $$$ to maintain it.........if you are looking for quiet, smooth, cheap transportation - get something else and leave the SS to someone else.

If you are looking for mega-horsepower at less than $100/per, then look no more - the Camaro SS is your car.  Its fast and jumps off the line with super-high torque and sounds great - all at the same time.  The Goodyear tires stick to the road like glue.  The suspension and steering are terrific.  The interior is spartan but sleek, and the passenger side &quot;bump&quot; in the floor is quickly forgotten as you watch the cars go by (behind you that is).

You WILL NOT find better performance for the dollar.........

It is a pleasure to drive and get it out on the highway and it hits a real groove.  Just be sure and keep the traction control on unless you are going in a straight line or have some driving experience because it is raw power.
