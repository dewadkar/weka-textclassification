            My father bought this car about 2 years ago.  I really loved it when he bought it.  It looks like a spaceship or something, but it is still attractive.  It drives very well. The acceleration is crisp and responsive.  When you nail it, It really goes.  The V8 is very smooth.  Its quick off the line.  The handling is pretty good.  Actually, it's exceptional considering the car weighs over 2 tons.  The ride is very comfortable, and the interior is a dream.  It is very user friendly and the on board computer with the really neato screen is very useful.  The stereo isnt great but it gets the job done.  The only real problem with this car is the sporatic reliabilty.  The air conditioner did not last very long at all, only about 50 thousand miles.  It has burned up to o2 sensors in about 60,000 miles.  The muffler hooks came loose on one side and the dual exhaust does not hang parallel.  The car overall is good, but the maintenence costs add up.<br><br>
