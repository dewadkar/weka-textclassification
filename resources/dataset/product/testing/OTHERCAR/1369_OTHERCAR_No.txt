            In 1996, when I wanted an SUV, I liked the Toyota 4Runner, but though the Isuzu Trooper offered more room and better &quot;luxury&quot;.  Also, none of the Toyota dealers wanted to &quot;deal&quot; - basically everyone was paying sticker. I looked at the Trooper Limited and my only reservation was that it did not come in white in 1996. The Isuzu dealer was nice enough to tell me that the new 1996 Acura SLX was available in white.  Back then, there was NO difference between the two manufactured versions, other than color and the badging.  I had been a happy Acura customer with my 1987 Legend Coupe (which I still have), so I made a good deal on the SLX at my local dealer and off I went... only to have the Consumer Reports scandal hit two weeks after I paid $36,000 for the SLX!  Although I won't comment specifically on the story and it's merits, I will tell you that *I* feel unsafe when taking corners at high-speeds.  We also own a Ford Explorer and had an Expedition and neither of these vehicles felt the same way. 

Three years and only 30000 miles later, I can tell you that it has been average on mechanical reliability. I've had to replace the battery and a solenoid went out. They were both under warranty, so not a big deal. Acura maintenance fees are pretty expensive, I could probably do better by just going right to Isuzu.  Also, I have never gotten the feeling that the superb Hunda/Acura mechanics know much about the Trooper/SLX.  Why Honda doesn't make their own SUV is beyond me.  But based on Acura's handling (or not-handling) of the Consumer Report's tip-over scare, I am a bit turned off on the brand.  Also, I wonder why I paid $36000 for a vehicle in 1996 when now I can get a top-of-the-line, fully-loaded Lexus RX300 for the same price.  The features on my SLX seem paltry compared to what other luxury SUVs have today, let alone American manufacturers like Ford.  My wife's Explorer has a better sound system, better AC, more power, features like a compass and outside temp gauge.  I realize that the new SLXs have more now, but still - when I get in my 1987 Acura Legend Coupe, I am amazed at the technology that car had in 1987!  It still would be considered ultra-modern even today.<br><br>
