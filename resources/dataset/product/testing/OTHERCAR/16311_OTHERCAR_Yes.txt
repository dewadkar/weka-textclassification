            I bought my HP digicam about a year ago from Value America (not in business anymore).  When I registered at VA, they had given me $120 in value dollars.  I had to purchase at least $240 to use those value dollars but all worked out well in my purchase w/this camera. 

I haven't checked to see what the retail price of the c200 is lately but it was going for $300 when I bought it, needless to say, I got mine at almost half the price.  At any rate, $300 for it a year ago was a decent price.  

I had been wanting a digicam for quite a while to share photos w/family and for creating websites.  The software was easy to install, comes w/several features which include the unloading, a viewer which you can view all of your photos with thumbnails, an option to auto print and share the photos via email (these last 2 I've not used yet). 

Camera features......I bought this one because of it's megapixel, I wanted one that I could take photos in different resolutions.  It has 3 settings, basic, fine and superfine.  I normally use the fine mode if I'm just taking photos to send to family.  I've found the basic mode just isn't of good quality.  I've used the superfine mode to take photos for website usage and if I plan to print them.  The camera has an upgradable memory card, it comes w/8 megs.  This is sufficient to me as I don't keep the images on the camera long.  In basic mode, you can take up to 80 photos, in fine mode, 40, and in superfine, 16.  

The camera only has a 2x zoom feature, I would eventually like to buy one that has more zoom ability.  For now, I can live w/this.  The camera also seems to need quite a bit of lighting, I've tried playing around w/the exposure settings but still find it needs a substantial amount of light.  It's not the greatest at taking pictures at night.  It says it has automatic exposure but I honestly think it doesn't work all that great.  I've had to use other software apps to edit the contrast and brightness in some of the photos I've taken.

The HP C200 has a 1.8 inch LCD color monitor that you can use to view your images after you taken them or to even focus in on what you want to shoot.  I recommend using the AC adapter it comes with for viewing to preserve battery life.  It does come w/the PC interface cable for unloading the camera.  With the software, you have the option to leave the images on the camera or delete them.  

A few other minor features include, auto shut off to preserve battery life, integrated flash w/red-eye reduction, the ability to view your images on a tv (comes w/cables to do this), 10 second self-timer, auto focus and is tripod accessible.

I recommend this digicam to first time buyers.  It's simple to use, comes with an easy to read instruction book and HP even offers online support for troubleshooting and how to's.  This is very beneficial if you've misplaced your book!<br><br>
