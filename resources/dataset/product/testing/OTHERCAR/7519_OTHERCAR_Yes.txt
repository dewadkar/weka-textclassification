            I have a 1997 Dodge Stratus.  I love this car.  Its color is Iris Pearlcoat.  I bought this car because it was a good price for the features it has and the comfort.  It is a good reliable car that any small family can enjoy.  It doesn't have a lot of big backseat room for older children but if you have small kids and are looking for a family car that has a little sporty look to it, than the Stratus would be good.  My car is now almost 4 years old and we have started to have a problem with leaking oil. A browse through the internet found a site that many people have had the same problem with the Stratus of the same or around the same year.  Most of the problems are all reported with the same symptoms.  So if you plan on buying a Stratus I would definitely ask about this problem.  But like I said, it is a good car, fun to drive and gets decent gas mileage, which is a big plus now with the price of gas soaring!!<br><br>
