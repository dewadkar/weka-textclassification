            Hyundai first penetrated the U.S. market in 1986 with the subcompact Excel.  In the years following its introduction, the South Korean automaker had grown a reputation for making "disposable" cars.  Now, all that has changed for the burgeoning car company.  In 2000, Hyundai took a step forward with the introduction of the XG300 at NAIAS, or the North American International Auto Show.  For 2002, the XG received a new, larger engine.  As a result, Hyundai changed the name from XG300 to XG350 reflecting a change in engine size from 3.0 liters to 3.5 liters.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The XG350 is an pretty attractive car.  Its distinctive styling ensures that people WILL NOT mistake it for something else.  Although the XG is sized similar to the Nissan Altima, it weighs almost 700 pounds more.  Although styling has not changed since its inception, new 205/60HR tires wrapped around 16-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels replace the previous 15-inch wheels.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: One of the first things I noticed about the XG350 was its frameless door glass.  Based on my experience with other cars that did not have frames, wind noise was quite loud.  This, however, is not the case with the XG.  Wind noise was actually quite low.  The engine is always quiet producing a muffled, yet unrefined engine whine when floored.

The dashboard is simple in design and the controls are sized perfectly.  The thing that sets the XG350 apart from its competitors is its wide array of luxury features at such a low price.  Interior materials feel look classy and feel upscale- not what I expected from a small South Korean carmaker.

Some standard features include a front and side airbags, cruise control, automatic climate control, a keyless entry system, leather upholstery and full power features.  The L model adds to this heated seats, a leather/wood steering wheel, and a power glass sunroof among others.

Being a rather tall driver, I found the XG's front seats quite accomodating.  Even with the sunroof, which usually chops 1-2 inches off headroom, there was more than enough headroom than expected.  The comfortable power seats are adjustable up to eight ways for the driver, four for the passenger.

The rear seats are not quite as supportive as the front.  Width-wise, there is just enough space for three medium-sized adults.  I found headroom in the backseats to be adequate at best, but legroom was pretty generous.

With 14.5 cubic feet of cargo space, the XG350 can carry more than enough than the average person would need to carry around.  Personally, I feel a car this long (191.5 inches) should have a least a little more cargo space.  This could be due to the fact the hinges are sickle-shaped, and intrude on some of the cargo room.  Split-folding rear seats do help, though.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The front-drive XG350 is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine, hence the name.  It puts out 194 horsepower at 5,500 rpm and 216 lb./ft. of torque at 3,500 rpm.  The power is sent through a 5-speed automatic transmission with a manual-shift gate.  Although horsepower is up only by two from the previous engine, there is a full 38 extra lb./ft. of torque.  The extra low-end muscle is felt instantaneously.  Very little throttle application is required for strong takeoffs.  On the highway, the XG's mounds of torque allows it climb steep hills with ease, and there is more than enough passing power.  The engine never feels short of breath at high rpms, but most of its torque is concentrated within the 2,000-4,000 rpm range and thus spends most of its time in that area.  The transmission is very smooth, and never hesitates to downshift- not that it needs to.

EPA estimates of 18 city, 26 highway suggest average fuel economy of around 16-17.  Not great, but considering it uses regular fuel, should be easier on the wallet in the long run.

<b>HANDLING</b>: With larger wheels on 16-inch tires (replacing 15s), I expected handling to be a little better.  The 205/60HR tires hold the road pretty well, but the suspension feels like it was tuned more for comfort.  Body roll is perceptible, but not that bad.  The XG weighs in at 3,651 pounds, and most of that heft resides up front.  The end result is noticeable understeer in hard cornering.  Stoppping power is good, but no match for an Acura 3.2TL or BMW 5-series.

<b>RIDE</b>: Hyundai tuned the XG350's shock absorbers more for comfort than sport.  Broken and patchy pavement NEVER upsets the XG's balance.  I did notice that the front-end of the car had the tendency to bounce around over large protrusions in the road- again due to the car's front-heavy characteristics and softish suspension.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: Hyundais are not exactly known for their "reliability", but over the years, they have improvced greatly.  No 2002 XG350 received a recall, but 2001 models did, however.  For more information see this website:

<b>VALUE</b>: The XG350 is comfortable, quick, inexpensive "luxury" car.  Although the South Korean automaker is still fairly new to the market, it is improving every year with faster, more reliable, and more stylish vehicles.  The XG's high features-per-dollar ratio and extremely long warranties make this car a great buy.  If you are in the market for a midsize luxury car, the XG350 is definitely worth a test drive at the very least.

My mother owns this car and I was able to test it while she was away at a convention.
