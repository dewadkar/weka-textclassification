            The Nissan Quest is the best vehicle that we ever purchased!!  I was pregnant for our 2nd son and we needed a reliable vehicle that would hold more than four people.  Our baby-blue van rides 7 people in total comfort!!  We love to travel in our beautiful van.  The back seat can be lowered or removed to fit luggage, souvenirs, camping gear, and baby gear.  

The only thing that I wish our Nissan Quest would have is dual rear sliding doors.  This would enable us to retrieve the baby at any angle without jumping in the back with him.  

We do LOVE the rear air-conditioning because we live in the deep south where a cold day is rare.  The rear air is awesome because the boys can keep the temperature in the back cooler or warmer than the front if the wish.

Radio controls are located in the front and back.  A well-loved feature located on the main panel is the radio lockout.  If the passenger loves to flip radio stations, the front controller can block/lockout their signals.  This is a MUST when teenagers are in the van!!

I have never owned a vehicle that is so comfortable for the driver as well as the passenger.  It is very easy to park.  This smooth ride is wonderful to lull a baby to sleep!!

I believe every family should have one!  This may not be a great idea for single people or couples.  It may be too large for their needs.  

Handicapped people can have easy access to the front seat.  It is roomy and has appropriate handles.  The back is extremely difficult for people who are handicapped in the lower extremities to get into.  My mom can get into the front easily but not the back!<br><br>
