            It may sound strange, but I own this K1500 cause Toyota stopped making their long bed, small pick-up.  When I got to shopping around, there was nothing on the market that would do the job I needed.  (Occasional hauling, more frequently camping and sleeping in the back end)  It came down to going smaller - with a Ford Ranger or going bigger - with a K1500 manual 5 speed, long bed, with a 6 cylinder engine.  I went bigger.

Thus far, the only non-upkeep trip to the shop was a wiring recall.  Must confess to being a bit worried about the cooling system initially.  It's hard to have a lot of faith in Cherry Kool-aid looking radiator fluid in a PLASTIC radiator.  But it's worked so far.

PRO:

1. Seems to be reliable thus far.

2. It has a &quot;feel&quot; almost exactly like my Dads '73 Chevy.  Family thing, I guess.

3. Fairly good MPG.

4. Positively luxurious bed.

5. This Work truck has none of the &quot;improvements&quot; I don't want or want to pay for.  (Air conditioning, power windows, power doorlocks, bucket seats - the sissy stuff....Yunno?)

6. The factory Firestone tires aren't the ones in the recall.

CON:

1. With a lightly loaded box, this truck tends to want to fish-tail going uphill on wash-board, gravel roads.  Take extra care.

2. <i>Daytime Running lights.</i> <b> Who ever thought of this?!</b>  Maybe I'm an unenlightened Hillbilly but back where I come from...if you want the headlights on.....you turn the bloody things on.  And sometimes, (hold on to your hat) you actually want them off.  Fortunately, if you don't have foglights, pulling a fuse solves this absurd problem easily with the K1500.

3. The steel on the bodies of these new Chevys are a lighter gauge than the older ones.

4. This truck needs tie down hooks mounted on the exterior of the box from the factory.  I often cinch a canoe up on the topper but was hard pressed to find anything to tie to.  Mounted some after market hooks on the side that will probably rust out in time.
