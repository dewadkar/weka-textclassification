            It's for good reason that the Honda Accord is one of the best selling cars in America.  I love my 1998 Honda Accord EX V6.

<b>First impression</b>
The first thing that turned me on to this car was the dashboard.  The whole dashboard tilts slightly away from the driver resulting in a very roomy feeling for the two front passengers.

<b>The drive</b>
Being a V6, it has a lot of power which was evident on my test drive.  I could easily drive in the fast lane going uphill on the freeway.  It also drives very smoothly and you can hardly hear the road.

<b>Inside</b>
The driver seat can be repositioned with electronic controls on the driver's left side -- very nice!  There is automatic temperature control, so you can keep the dial set at 75 deg. and it will automatically cool off in the summer and heat up in the winter.  The steering wheel has buttons that control the radio volume and let you flip between radio stations or CD tracks.  This is a great safety feature, since you don't have to take your hands off the wheel.  It's also fun to freak people out by adjusting the volume -- they don't see you doing it!

<b>Outside</b>
Even though the Accord is known as a &quot;family&quot; car, I have received many compliments for its stylish look.  I purchased a blue Accord car cover from Honda which keeps the sun from beating down on the leather interior.  I highly recommend using a car cover like this.  The gas cover has a holder for the gas cap so that when you are filling your tank, you have a place to put it.  I have forgotten my gas cap at gas stations before so I really appreciate this feature.

<b>Conclusion</b>
Hondas are known for holding their value well, and it is easy to see why.  In the almost 3 years that I've had this Accord, I've never had a problem and it still drives the same as the day I bought it.  I have never met a Honda owner who wasn't satisfied.  I highly recommend this car.  <br><br>
