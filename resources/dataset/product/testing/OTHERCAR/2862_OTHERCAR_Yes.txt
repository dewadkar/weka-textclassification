            I'm usually one for long-winded, very methodically laid-out Epinions.  And it's been awhile, but I had to opine very off-the-cuff about my recent purchase of the Nikon Coolpix 3500.

I bought it at a big-box wholesale club for just over $300.  It's been 3 weeks since I've had it.  And I'm absolutely convinced this was a wise purchase.

I own a Nikon Coolpix 990.  One of the original 3.0+ megapixel cameras when digital was not routine.  I paid more than $900 for the camera, and it is not only clunky, it was prone to being more nuisance than convenience.

Not so with the Coolpix 3500.  It's compact -- shirt pocket size!  And it's not very heavy.

With my previous experience with Nikon digital cameras, I expected a lot with the Coolpix 3500.  And this version tops even my older Coolpix 990.  I like the Coolpix 3500's features such as:
 - White Balance control
 - Pre-Set "Settings" for Picture Quality
 - Quick View Button for Last Snapped Photo
 - Swivel Lens for those over-the-crowd shots
 - Battery Life is Respectable with Li-Ion

There are a few features that I wish the Coolpix 3500 would have been equipped with; they are:
 - Optical Viewfinder
 - Microphone Input
 - Slightly Larger Display
 - Less Flimsy Slide-Rule On/Off/Mode Selector
 - Less Sensitive AutoFocus

Overall, however, my Coolpix 3500 is a dream.  It's a little less 'camera-ish' than my Coolpix 990; but apparently, the trend toward what digital cameras need to feel like are inherently different from film cameras.

I had been looking for a respectable camera to purchase that I wouldn't have to pay a mint for, and wouldn't have to feel like I was lugging around bricks.  The Coolpix 3500 is the answer for those concerns.  I considered several other cameras, and purchased them also; they are:
 - Fuji Finepix 2650
 - Canon Elph 2.0

Over both, the Coolpix 3500 is leaps and bounds better -- especially since the Coolpix 3500 is a 3.0+ megapixel machine.

The Nikon Coolpix 3500 is definitely worth every cent!
