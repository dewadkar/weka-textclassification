            I own a 1984 Z28 and test drove the 2000 Z28 that had 1000 miles on it.  The car was a vast improvement.  The car's best virtues were improved quietness, the road noise was almost null.  The car had an awesome transmission ratio hitting 40 in first gear with not touching the red line.  The new Z has the fastest styling cues handed down by chevy.  The Z28 I test drove had the Z28 styling kit with ground effects that didn't rub as much as older Z's and RS' do and there was a nice high wing on the back making the car look like it was going 100mph at a stop sign.  The car is equipped with manual shift which was as smooth as the standard leather.  The extra power comes at a low gas cost increase less than 5 mpg decrease.<br><br>
