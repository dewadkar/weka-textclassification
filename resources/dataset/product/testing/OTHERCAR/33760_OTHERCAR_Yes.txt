            We owned another Alfa, a 33 before this one. Actually we still own it and it is my wife's favourite. It has gotten a 1.7 boxer engine, 16 valves, 98 Kwh. That one makes about 10 km with 1 liter of gasoline (which is too little), high insurance and road taxes due to the engine power. We have been always very proud of it and it has brought us all over in Europe, from Italy to Spain, Portugal, Scotland, France, Germany, Belgium and others for a total of 200000 km. It is still well alive and kicking. 
It is getting a bit old now and we simply needed another car. Initially I was trying to convince my wife that a Toyota would be better, because of the 5 years or 150000 guaranteed km. But instead she managed to convince me that another Alfa was what we needed, that now there were models cheaper to run and so on. So after a lot of thoughts and having looked also at other alternatives, we finally settled for this "vela blue" 156 sportwagon, 1.9 JTD engine, blue leather interiors, kit sport 3, and various other amenities. This was one of the best decision that I have taken in a long time. The car does about 16 km with a liter of diesel fuel, which in Europe costs about 25% less that gasoline. If you take a 2000 km trip, for instance it can be seen that with the old car it costed about 232 euros, while with the new one it's about 113. The engine, despite being a diesel has got a lot of personality and performs very well on the road. The sport kit 3 includes larger wheels. Overall the car is stable and effortless to drive (for European standards) as I had never seen before (I have also tried some VW and Opels, major disappointments even if compared with the old Alfa 33). 
I understand that having been a satisfied an happy Alfa driver for several years makes me a likely buyer of other Alfas, but this time I tried hard to find an alternative that gave me the full pleasure of driving (Euro-style, no automatic box, feel the engine and don't pay a fortune to run the car) at a reasonable price. I found this one to be the best and after a month and 5000 km I still think so. We paid about 24500 euros for it.
