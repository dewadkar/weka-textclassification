            I know what you are thinking -- Hyundai?  didn't they make the Excel?  I thought the same thing.  In fact, I almost refused to look at Elantra, thinking it too boxy and almost assuredly shoddily put-together.  However, it took only a few minutes in the drivers seat to know that this was not the same old Hyundai.

The Elantra is in the same class as the Ford Escort ZX2 and the Dodge Neon.  It is a four-cylinder compact.  However, that is where the comparisons end.  The first surprise I got came when I stepped on the accelerator.  The DOHC 4 is responsive, and has a good deal more power than one has come to expect from Hyundai.  In fact, I believe that it churns out 140 horses, as compared to the mid to low 130's for the Ford and Dodge. The Elantra seems to accelerate faster than either the ZX2 or the Neon, and unlike the other two, it does not feel that it is being pushed at speed. I commute 45 miles one way to work, and have yet to feel as though I am without adequate power, whether coming off the line to race in front of someone at the light, or trying to pass in fifth on the highway.  The shifting is, for the most part, nimble, though it can seem a little clunky when running through the gears quickly.

The interior of the Elantra is just as impressive as the performance, especially considering that the vehicle I purchased was less than 12,000 dollars.  For next to no extra money, the Elantra comes with a power package that includes power windows, door locks, and mirrors.  It also has rear-window defrost and air conditioning standard, as opposed to most other vehicles in its class and price range.  I am 6'3&quot;, and still find the interior roomy, with adequate head and leg room, and a good ratio of pedal distance to wheel and shifter distance.  The drivers seat is adjustable both in the seat height and tilt, as well as providing three levels of lumbar support.  It even comes with a am/fm cassette standard, which provides good sound from four speakers.

The Elantra does have some draw backs.  Under heavy breaking, the vehicle does seem to get a little squirly (sp?).  I would guess this is due to its low weight, which is also why, despite being front wheel drive, its traction in ice and snow is adequate rather than exceptional.  The exterior design is a little out there.  My father commented that the rear tail-lights made it look as though it were a smiling alien. The interior noise level will never be described as quiet, though it is not loud enough to annoy.  Ergonomically speaking, the center console compartment is so small as to make it almost unusable for anything other than a large soda, and even that is difficult, as the lid does not flip all the way back, but rather sticks up at 90 degrees when fully open.  Also, as a coffe-drinker, I have noticed that the cup holders are poorly placed.  With cups in them, it is impossible to reach the radio dials, and even when it is extended without cups occupying it, one cannot access the ash-tray (if so inclined), nor can the lighter port be used, neither for its intended purpose nor to plug in a cd player or other electronic device.

All in all, the Elantra provides many unexpected perks, more than enough to offset its minor annoyances.  Combine all of this with a 10 year, 100,000 mile power train warranty, and you have perhaps the best value for the money in the Auto business.<br><br>
