            Burb nickname:  Hotel Heinz!

We purchased our '99 Suburban after the birth of our 2nd son, in September '99.  I can't say how much how much I LOVE the extra space.  I don't know how we did it with our first daughter driving in a Honda Accord!  Getting adjusted to parking took me awhile to get used to!

Though our monthly gas bill is huge, I is well worth it.  We have taken our burb to the shop on a couple of occassions, all due to the manufacturer.  The brakes continue to be a minor problem (just large screeching sounds while utilizing).  I have found now that the dashboard has cracked due to the screws being tightened too much at the time the vehicle was made.  I was told this is a common problem, it is covered by the warranty and they're replacing it.

We just returned from a camping trip, and towing two jet skiis (the kind you sit on)was like towing nothing.  I would never tow them before, now I will.  We also removed the 3rd seat for storage, and my infant an I slept back there (he wakes during the night and didn't want the campsites to wake as well!) and we slept comfortably with no problem.  My husband of 6'6&quot; also sleeps comfortably (still need some cushion though).
When we camp, we tell them to look for &quot;Hotel Heinz&quot; to locate us!

Also, taking the burb to Lake Tahoe to go snow skiing, was an ease driving in the snow!  Again, I wouldn't do it before, but now, it's too easy!

I highly recommend this SUV, even with it's minor brake problem and interior problem.  It is just a HUGE car, especially for the sports enthusiasts.  We also especially love the vents for heating &amp; air for my daughter of 4 who continues to get car sick!
