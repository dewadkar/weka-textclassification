            This is a very reliable vehicle. I've had my car for 2 years now and no major problem. Obviously an occasional oil change and fluids but all in all it starts every time and gets me everywhere I need to go. Very good on gas mileage , it's a 4 cylinder and drives nice and smooth. The screw fell out of the seat and the steering lock finally gave way but I can still manage to get from point A to point B.

It only seats 4 adults, or 2 adults and 3 children in the back seat so if you want a roomy car this is not for you. If you're single on the other hand or just you and a significant other this car will suit your needs well.

The main thing about this vehicle is it's reliability and how smooth it drives. If you are seeking a used car this is a good buy for you to get you to work, shopping ect. I highly recommend this car to you.

It has sufficient trunk space for storing groceries and other materials in and the seats are very comfortable and relaxing. not much leg room in the back seat if you're a passenger, but if you're the driver you got it made ! So with all said this car will get you where ever you need to go plus some a great car for the value and you should be able to get it at a good price since it is over 10 years old.
