            After bringing me to several dealerships and looking at a few different cars, my best friend chose this one as the best balance of safety, reliability, and cost.  Two weeks later he was hit from the rear at 70 miles per hour on the expressway, throwing his car into the car in front of his and crushing both ends.  Now this is the true test of a car's safety features.

In spite of the impact, the cab of the car was not damaged and he walked away.  The one thing that people don't tell you though is that the sensors for the airbags are in the front bumper - and this car is low to the ground.  Despite all the force with which he was thrown at the car in front of his, the airbags did not deploy because the impact was above the sensors.  A safety feature is useless if it does not function.

The safe design of the rest of the car did probably save his life, so I really can't complain too much.  He is buying another '01 Corolla to replace it.  The car does drive nicely (for the 2 weeks we had it around).  It cuts turns well and has excellent pick up.  The back seat is very cramped and for that reason I would not recommend it to families, but very few cars are perfect.  For a car in is class, this one is excellent.

As for durability, I think this particular model will have to stand the test of time on its own, but Toyota has a good record for cars that last.  I even know of some Corollas from the early '80's that are still running well, and there is no reason to believe that the quality of workmanship has deteriorated since then.  If you like this car, I would go ahead and get it, just make sure to add the anti-lock brake system (the standard brakes have no safety feature) and wear your seatbelt because you can't count on the airbags.<br><br>
