            I bought this vehicle new in 1991 and have been driving it for almost 8 years.  It currently has 160,000 miles on it. In 1997 I was contacted by the dealer that I had bought it from and he offered to buy it back from me (without even seeing it) for $13,000! He did ask how many miles it had on it (it was 100,000 at the time) and asked if we had had any wrecks (we had not). He said they couldn't keep enough used ones on the lot to satisfy the demand. 

In the past 8 years, here are the things that have gone wrong:

1.  The rear window will no longer roll up from the inside.
2.  The brake pads had to be replaced after about 100,000 miles.
3.  The tires had to be replaced after 85,000 miles.
4.  A loose drive shaft had to be fixed at a cost of about $200 after 155,000 miles.
5.  The spare tire is hard to disengage.

Not bad for 160,000 miles.  This is by far the best car I have ever owned!  And I have owned a Pontiac, 2 Chevy's, a Nissan and 2 Fords.<br><br>
