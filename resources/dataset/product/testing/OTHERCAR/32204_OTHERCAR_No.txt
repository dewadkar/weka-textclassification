            The experience that I've had with my 1999 Cavalier has been horrendous to say the least.  The day that I picked it up it had problems, as I drove home from the dealership the car was shuddering every time I turned left. Realizing something was very wrong, I angrily drove back to the dealership. The problem turned out be a defective wheel mount, so it was the first day that I had my brand new car and it was in the shop.  The next problem that I experienced was only about a month later.  There was a loud whistling sound every time the car accelerated, so I brought it back to the dealer to find out the source of the problem and rectify it.  This supposed morning trip turned out to be a two day affair, these people couldn't figure out what the problem was.  Then, these geniuses finally decided to call the manufacturer to see if they had this problem on file; it turned out to be the air compressor and was a common problem on the new Cavaliers.  They kept my car for two days for a problem that could've been solved in a few hours!  Recently, after only 8,000 miles, the rotors became warped and needed to be replaced.  The service people couldn't even give an answer as to why this problem occurred either.  The last problem with this vehicle that is more annoying than anything is the constant rattling of the dashboard and other parts in the cab when it is cold out. Driving down the street to the store becomes a quest to find out what the hell is loose in there!

Now, aside from the mechanical problems, I'm also unhappy with the apparent lack of consideration that GM has for its younger buyers.  There are virtually no after-market performance and upgrade accessories for the Cavalier in comparison with competing Japanese models.  I watch my friends beef up there Civics, Accords, Eclipses, etc.  I, on the other hand, have an incredibly difficult time both finding accessories and affording them (the ones that I did find are way too expensive).  Another gripe that I have is the lack of horsepower to fuel economy ratio.  The coupe model has only 115 hp and gets 28 city/mpg and 34 highway/mpg.  A comparable Toyota Corrolla DX has 137 hp and gets between 35 mpg and 40 mpg. 

In conclusion I'd like to make a few more comments.  This vehicle is a travesty of American engineering, I've owned two other Chevys and never experienced even close to the amount of problems that I've experienced with this vehicle. I hope that in this new millenium GM will improve the quality of the Cavalier and make me proud to buy American again.
