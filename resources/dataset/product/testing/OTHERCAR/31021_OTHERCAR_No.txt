                 I own a 1999 Toyota Tacoma PreRunner pick up that had a 17,110 price tag on it when I bought it new.  For that you only get manual windows, manual locks, the most pathetic base 2 speaker stereo I've ever seen in a vehicle and by far the most uncomfortable seats I've ever had to endure.  I did get the 4 speed automatic transmission mated to the somewhat underpowered 2.7 liter 4 cylinder engine.  In addition, the dealership had installed a rather nice over-the-rail bedliner that is durable and useful.
     Although only 2 wheel drive, the off-road capabilities of the 
PreRunner are fairly impressive.  I did not opt for the TRD upgrade but I am still very satisfied with the overland capabilities of this small truck.  Although, more interior room would be greatly appreciated.  When you put two full grown men in this rather small regular cab pick-up, you quickly run out of space.  That coupled with the stiff and uncomfortable seats makes long road trips a trying task.
     Reliability has been outstanding.  At 2000 miles the tape player died and the dealership replaced it.  Although the mechanic that worked on it had failed to properly reinsert one of the plastic rivets that holds the center console in place.  I had to fix it myself in the driveway.  At about 15,000 miles the brake light began to come on from time to time when I would make right hand turns.  I took it to the dealership and the service technician advised me that all it needed was to have the brakes cleaned.  So I paid them $35. to clean the brakes and the light still came on from time to time during right hand turns.  I decided to add a little bit of brake fluid on the off chance it was a low enough to dip down and hit the sensor during turns.  Bingo!  Wasted $35 for the dealer to clean my brakes when all I needed was $1.50 for some brake fluid.  Other then that I have had no problems and the truck still runs good.
     After comparing a number of Toyota products to competitors I have found that the their single biggest problem is lack of options, especially in light of how much money they want for their vehicles.  I recently test drove a &quot;V6&quot; extended cab Tundra.  Cloth seats, power windows and locks and cruise control were about the extent of the options list.  For this they wanted $26,000.  It didn't even have keyless remote entry.  The Tacoma line up doesn't fair any better.  I've seen $26,000 price tags on the 4x4 V6 Tacoma.  While Chevrolet is offering 4 wheel disc ABS on their trucks it's not even available on Tundra or Tacoma.  ABS is available but only for another $600.  It seems as if Toyota wants to option as much as they can on their vehicles and charge a great deal of money for those options.  I couldn't even get a clock in my truck without spending another $200!
     I don't know what the problem is at Toyota management but I think they had better wake up to the sobering fact that the gap between high quality and low quality vehicles is constantly getting smaller.  Eventually they won't be able to use their reputation as a good quality product as an excuse for selling their vehicles at higher prices while offering fewer options then their competitors.  My next truck is going to be a Chevrolet.
Update: 8 - 17 - 2000
     In addition to the minor problems I have had to take my Tacoma into the dealership two more times.  These two were only minor problems and while I can say that Toyota makes a very reliable product, the dealership here has a service department that leaves a lot to be desired.
     One evening I got in the truck to go to work.  At the time my key was the type that was made of plastic on the grasping end.  I put it in the ignition and turned it.  As I did the end where the key ring attaches snapped.  I expect because it was just cheap plastic, because this key had never been exposed to any kind of harsh or unusual treatment of any kind. When I took it to the dealership they wanted to charge me to replace my key.  I explained to the service rep. that I had a 36,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty and that the ignition was definitely between the bumpers.  He refused to replace the key so I had to find the service manager and explain to him that I pay a sizeable amount of money every month to &quot;rent&quot; Toyota's truck and for that kind of money you would think they could replace a cheap poorly made key when it breaks.  He agreed and they replaced the key at no charge.
     A few weeks ago while getting out of the truck the seat shield that runs along the bottom of the seat and covers the seat frame that bolts into the floorboard popped off.  Now I don't have the resources or facilities to test for design flaws, but I think this is the only one I have found in the Tacoma.  In the initial version of the Tacoma it sits much lower to the ground then mine because it does not have the off road suspension and wheels.  In the case of these trucks this seat shield is probably more than adequate.  But in the taller PreRunner version you basically slide off the side of the seat until your feet meet the ground.  This has the effect of putting a lot of down pressure on the plastic shield.
     I tried popping it back in place before taking it to the dealership but the plastic hardpoint that secures it to the seat frame was stripped and I knew it would have to be replaced.  I explained all that when I took the truck in but of course the dealership always assumes that every customer is a moron who has no idea what they are talking about.  So they tried just popping the shield back on and replacing the screw.  This of course did not work and I was not at all pleased to say the least.  I called the manager and had a little chat with him about the level of service I had been receiving at his service department.  Our conversation was less than pleasant.  
     So I had to take the truck back to them so they could order the part, and then back again once the part came in so they could replace it.  When I picked it up it &quot;still&quot; was not properly attached.  Now the rear portion of the shield was loose, exposing the rear part of the seat frame.  Once again I had a conversation with the manager and had to take it back for a &quot;fourth&quot; time before this simple part was finally properly repaired.  
     At any rate, that's the kind of service I get from my Toyota dealer, I can't speak for dealers in other parts of the country.  I'm sure most are better.  I expect some minor occasional problems when I buy any vehicle because let's face it, cars are made by humans and humans are not perfect.  So far that is all I have had, very minor problems.  The major problem has been mechanics at the dealership that cut corners and do not finish these simple repair jobs properly.  The drive train has been outstanding.  I personally feel the truck runs better now then the day I bought it.  But because of the service I have had I seriously doubt I'll buy another one because I simply don't trust the capabilities of the mechanics at my local dealership and I would have to drive 30 miles to the next closest one.
