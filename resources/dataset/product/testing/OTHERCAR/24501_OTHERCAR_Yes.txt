            This is the first digital camera that I have owned and I searched for about 8 months until I finally came upon an ad in Yahoo.com magazine for this camera. I had no idea of the price but I started researching and finally found the only store in my area that had it. The price $999.00. I compared how much the storage would cost, CDRW - 4 pack 25.00 (not bad at all and re-recordable for reuse over and over) and it also used CDRs. I was hooked. I did not want to have to buy a lot of stuff to connect to my computer to download the pictures and I wanted to make MANY pics without running out of room on the storage media. This was the perfect fit. I got a $50 mail-in rebate and a $20 rebate from Sony if I purchased an accessory from their catalog (included in the package). There also was available the cheaper MVC-CD that only took CDRs. 
For an amateur, this is more camera than I know what to do with and after owning it for 2 months, I still learn things about it daily. 
The camera is very simple to use straight out of the box. Click a picture, take out the CDRW or connect USB to your computer, and copy the pic to your hard-drive. It states compatibility with CDRWs but I have an Iomega external CDRW and it is not compatible. Sony says they only know it is definitely compatible with their brand of CDRW. So, your CDRW may not recognize the storage media CDRW disc unless you have a Sony brand, but there is a way around this. 
You can download through the USB cable from your camera, or what I do is take out the CDRW disc, insert it into my CD-ROM and copy the pictures off the disc. It is very easy. 
I paid $999.00 plus $200.00 for a warranty (LCD and CDRW can have problems if you ever drop it or hit the camera on something) for a total with tax of and estimate $1300.00.
