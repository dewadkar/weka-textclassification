            Toyota could not have made a better vehicle in this truck.  I have a 2WD with the 4WD drive package.  It looks just like a 4WD except the price is lower (the best of both worlds).  These trucks to not tear up, they are the most durable truck of all make and models.  The Tacoma also has the highest reseller value over the Dodge Dakota, Ford Ranger and Chevrolet S10 (these are the equivalent).  The price is a little higher than the competitors, but it is well worth it.  You have many options to chose from, with one exception, they do not come in the color yellow (that has always been my favorite caller for a vehicle).  Hope you enjoys yours as much as I do mine.  Oh and guys, the truck is loved by the ladies (if you let them drive the truck, they will let you drive them around (if you know what I mean)!<br><br>
