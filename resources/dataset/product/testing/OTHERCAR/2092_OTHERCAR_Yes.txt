            We just bought this car last month, so there hasn't been a lot of time to see problems yet. So that's my qualification. It does have 100000 miles on it, but we got such a deal, we really couldn't turn it down. We needed something comfortable to ride in, as we have to make a lot of long distance trips lately.

There was a sensor of some kind out when we bought it, but the dealer fixed that and we haven't had any problems (she says while knocking very vigorously on wood) yet. The repair records were with the car and it looked like it was very well taken care of before we got it. I like the fact that it takes less that 1/2 of what my suv does to fill the gas tank. The mileage is fabulous comparibly and it drives like a dream. I also like the fact that it 'picks up and gits' when I have to enter the highway.

The front wheel drive took me a bit to get used to and not having a clutch, but that had nothing to do with the car. I'm also not completely comfortable with the fact that I can't see like I could with my truck, but that hasn't anything to do with the car either. The front is very comfortable and I like having bucket seats as my husband is a lot taller than me. He likes the reclining seats because while I'm driving, he can get comfortable. My girls like the fact that they have their own doors and don't have to remember to pull the seats up to get in. It has air and that will be nice in the summer and the radio/cassette has really nice sound.

The back seats fold down to extend the trunk, so I can carry lots more than I would have thought. The trunk is a very nice size though and I really can't picture needing to do that.

Right now, we are really pleased with our purchase and hope to keep this one for a long time.<br><br>
