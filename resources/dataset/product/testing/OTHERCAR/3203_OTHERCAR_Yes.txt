            I feel the Sony DSC-S85 is the best camera in its class. My photography background rates as semi-serious with 30 years of experience including a few years of darkroom work. Before purchasing the Sony DSC-S85, I extensively research reviews and company websites. Instead of listing every feature the Sony DSC-S85 in detail as most reviews, I will explain how I reached the decision to purchase the Sony DSC-S85 instead of another digital camera.

MEGAPIXELS - The Sony DSC-S85 has 4.1 megapixels whereas most of the other cameras only have 3.34 megapixels. More pixels provide less visible picture grain. You can print at least 10" x 14" pictures and passable 11" X 14" pictures. The few other 4.1 megapixels cameras available offered fewer features, cost more and had some performance drawbacks. 

PICTURE RESOLUTION - The Sony DSC-S85 beat all of the other cameras in the same class as it. Most of the reviews I read made this point very clearly.  It beat the Nikon Coolpix 995, the Cannon Powershot G1 and the Olympus 4040.  The Cannon Powershot G1 may have the same lens as well as another camera but they just do not seem to be able to get the same resolution electronically.

BATTERY - The Sony DSC-S85 has great battery life of over 3 hours on the average. It even has better battery life reported in testing than it's lower 3.34 megapixal brother the Sony DSC-S75. Now that I have the camera, I can say that the battery will last most heavy shooters all day. Most of the reviews of the competitor cameras suggested a spare battery. Also the battery is one of Sony's standard camcorder batteries.  Note: The AC power supply provided which is quite large is also the battery charger.

PRICE - About $100 less than the competitor cameras. "And that is all I've got to say about that".

FILM SPEED NOISE - Very little noise as you progress with film speed (ISO/ASA) as compared with other digital cameras especially the Cannon Powershot G1 as read in reviews. I will say the Cannon Powershot G1 does very well at ISO 50 but lets face it, that is very limiting film speed for a filmless digital camera. I guess film speed really relates to pixel sensitivity in a digital camera. 

MEMORY STORAGE � The Sony DSC-S85 like most Sony products use their Memory Sticks to store the pictures and movies taken.  Just recently they have lowered their Memory Stick prices to about that of the Smart Cards and the Compact Flash cards.  128 Meg is the largest available concurrently but there are plans for sizes all the way to 1 Gig according to the Sony Rep I talked to.  The Memory Stick is inserted in the bottom of the camera next to the battery.

WHITE BALANCE � The Sony is weaker here than it�s nearest competitors.  The only way I was able to overlook this was because Sony was wise enough to provide a �push� white balance feature.  To utilize you point the camera at a well-lighted white area and allow the camera to adjust its white balance to it once you have used the feature to set it.  This overcomes the lack of several white balance settings as other cameras have.

ZOOM � The Sony DSC-S85 has a 3X optical zoom and 2X digital zoom.  I did not consider any digital zoom when searching for my new camera since a digital zoom work at the expense of picture resolution.  The 3X zoom is in about the middle of the pack for range and will suit at least 95% of my zoom requirements.

LCD � All of the reviews I read praised the Sony�s LCDs.  Sure there were a couple of competitors camera that had good LCDs also but were not rated as high.

CCD � A lot of other digital camera companies use Sony CCDs.  Once again, "And that is all I've got to say about that".

TRIPOD MOUNT � This could have been a potential problem with it positioned in far corner on the bottom of the camera.  Luckily the camera does not weight enough for this to be much of a concern and it allows for the battery and Memory Stick to be changed while on a tripod.

COLOR � The Sony DSC-S85 captures great SONY color (slightly cool usually).  It held its own when compared to other digital cameras.  What it lacks in upper end whites was made up in all of the other colors.  I see this as the camera�s weakest point.

ANALOG TO DIGITAL � Here the SONY DSC-S85 shines again.  It uses 14 bits to capture data whereas the other companies use 8 to 12 bits.  That is 2 to 8 times the possible color resolution.

EASE OF USE � My wife learned to use it in 1-1/2 hours.  My 14 year old son had it MASTERED in less time!  "And that is all I've got to say about that".

CONTROLS � Well laid out.  The Sony DSC-S85 had more of the commonly used features available as buttons instead of buried in the menus as other digital cameras.

APERTURE & SHUTTER PRIORITY � The Sony DSC-S85 works flawlessly through all positions where some other digital cameras would not.

MANUFACTUROR � A digital camera appears to be basically a camcorder modified to take still shots in digital format.  Sony has a lot of experience making camcorders and is considered an industry leader.  They are also the largest seller of digital cameras.
