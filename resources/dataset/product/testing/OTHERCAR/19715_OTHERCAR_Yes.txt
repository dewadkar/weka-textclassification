            About six months ago, I bought a used '92 Saturn, four door, five speed, with low mileage, good maintenance record, and blah, blah, blah. It turned out to be a complete nightmare. The car was in the shop every two weeks, and I had to be towed three times. Thinking that I would get the most for a trade-in at a Saturn dealer, I decided to bite the bullet and buy a 2000 station wagon. I got $1600 for my trade-in, and bought a five speed, SW with Saturn's security system, a CD player, and automatic locks for a little over $15,000.
Firstly, let me say that the station wagon rides more solidly than the sedan, and sits a few inches higher off the ground, making it easier to get in and out of. I like the day running lights (standard), the new lumbar roll in the driver's seat, and how roomy the interior is when the back seats are folded down. I'm getting about 25 mph in the city, over 30 mph on the highway, and love the rear window wiper in the rain. I can fit two dogs, groceries, and a few pieces of luggage with room to spare.
Anyone looking for a decent, unexciting, and practical vehicle would enjoy this car. 
I have few dislikes of this car, other than the fact that there is no lumbar roll in the passenger's seat (they like to be comfortable too), the car mats are cheap, and the security system was a little bit difficult to figure out. <br><br>
