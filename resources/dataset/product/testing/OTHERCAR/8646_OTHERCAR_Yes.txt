            After owning two previous Nissan's without any troubles whatsoever, I knew my next vehicle would be a Nissan again.  My girlfriend and sister also drive Xterra's and the Frontier shares the same engine and platform so it's basically the same truck with a bed though.  

So off to the dealership to look at the new Frontier's.  I got a great price because a friend of mines works for Nissan.  Once I saw it in person, I fell in love.  The aggresiveness of this truck was very appealing to me.  The test drive went well but left me wanting a lil bit more power and torque.  Of course I'm one of those HP junkies.  Then I test drove the Supercharged model and I was sold.  

The seating is very comfortable with the bucket seats.  I'm 5'10" and there is a lot of headroom for me.  All the controls are laid out perfectly, it's very ergonomic and user friendly.  The ride is kind of harsh but it is good for a truck with leaf springs in the rear.  If you want a car like ride this truck is not for you.  Buy a truck based on a car platform like the Honda CR-V (accord), Rav4 (corolla), etc.  

Overall, I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a "real" truck and not a "high riding" car.  If you are the weekend mudder or off roader this truck is perfect for you.
