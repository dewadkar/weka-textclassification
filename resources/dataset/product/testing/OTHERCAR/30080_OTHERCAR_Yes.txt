            I bought this camera based on reviews at CNet.com. I paid about $500 including shipping from Outpost.com (8/2000). I was about to go on a trip driving across country, and wanted a digital camera to bring with me. I figured I would bring a laptop and dump pictures periodically. I also wanted to try out the immediate gratification of digital photography. 

The DC 280 comes with an 8MB flash card. You have three &quot;quality levels&quot; to choose from (Good, Better, Best). I chose &quot;Better&quot; which lets you fit 17 pictures on the flash card. This turned out to be enough for most days. I would fill the camera and dump the pics using the USB interface (included) into my laptop at night. I could then erase the camera and start anew. Boring stretches of road in the passenger seat could be used to edit/shrink the pics on the laptop using the bundled Adobe PhotoDeluxe software. Pictures are initially about 20 x 16, I shrunk to 8 x 5 at 72 DPI. This fit nicely through email (30-60K per pic). Pictures are stored in standard JPEG format, so anyone with a browser can view them. Dumping pics to a USB enabled computer is very easy, drag and drop.

There's also an RCA video out cable included to preview pics on a television. There is a slide show mode on the camera, which is quite useful when you're hooked up to a TV. 

Downsides: does not come with an A/C adapter. This would be nice for times when you want to dump pictures but don't have any batteries lying around. The adapter is available as an add-on, but I haven't bothered. My friend worked around this by owning three sets of the Kodak rechargeable photo batteries, which are quite good. The battery life on them is great. Using alkalines in this camera is futile (see other reviews). Get 2-3 sets of the Photolife rechargeables if you can. One set (and the charger) is included with the camera.

I have not handled this camera with care, and it keeps on working. I carry it snowboarding in my pocket. Just keep the lens cap on.
