            After researching, comparing, and test driving everything from Saturn's to Honda's, we decided to try the 2000 Pontiac Grand Am SE.  Many of today's vehicles seem to look so much alike.  The Pontiac Grand Am SE has it's own unique look, it's stylish and sporty, yet big enough to fit a family of five.  

Looks aren't everything, so we decided it was important to test drive the car and seek opinions from other Pontiac owners.  Everyone had good things to say.  The car handles very well, even in a Chicago snow storm.  The safety features are numerous, including double airbags.  Even the basic car has many amenities - driving this car completely spoils you.  Take a test drive and see what I mean!  

The stereo system, even the basic system, sounds extremely good.  The service department at our local dealer has been very responsive to any needs we may have, such as oil changes.  The car is a little pricey, as we paid about $21,000, but the price is well worth the quality.  We have had no problems with our Grand Am, and we love driving it.  

Picture yourself in a beautiful car, on a winding road, on a spring day, with the stereo playing your favorite tunes, the sun roof down, and a warm breeze flowing through your hair - this is what life is like in a Pontiac Grand Am SE.  <br><br>
