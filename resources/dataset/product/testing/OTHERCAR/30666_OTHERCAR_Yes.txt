            I've had my Jeep now for three years, and after three years driving in it, i have had no problems with it at all.  I've driven it from 14 hours in a row, and it still had a half-full gas tank, and the car was still not overheated at all.  It drives smooth, and unlike what some people say about Jeeps, I've never had a near tipping experience, in fact I can take sharp turns at 55mph, and still not feel like i'm in danger.  I leased this car because of the price.  $199 a month for 36 months and $2500 down.  I love the fact that I can drive all day and not feel worried about the condition about my car, and i love the space I have.  Driving this vehicle is awesome, and it feels like you're driving on clouds, that's how smooth it is.  I really recommend the Jeep Grand Cherokee, and I Guarantee that you'll like driving it.<br><br>
