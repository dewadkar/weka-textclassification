            The Maxima is a car that seats 5 adults comfortably, looks good cruising almost anywhere (although some may not like the styling), and gets decent gas mileage.  Did I mention that it goes like a bat out of .... er.... uhhh....heck?  This car is living proof that you can have a fast, practical car that doesn't cost a fortune.  In my eyes, there's not a car that can touch it for up to $10,000 above it's price range.  

The Nissan Maxima has received almost every major award it qualifies for.  That says something but not everything because some of those guys who review cars are out of touch with reality.  In this case though, they are right.

The cars come in 3 trim levels GXE (the base model) SE (sporty model) and the GLE (luxury model).  The best part is that all 3 have the same beautiful V6 engine.  The engine alone has been praised by the auto journals like Motor Trend and Ward's.  Because of this the GXE is a great model, it comes with all the standard toys: ABS, Air conditioning, power everything, and a remote keyless entry with an anti-theft device. the only major thing you don't get is the luxury of a leather interior (which I don't like anyway, too hot in the summer, too cold in the winter).  The higher models do have some advantages though .  They have specifically tuned suspension; the sport a stiffer suspension meant for handling, and the luxury a higher grade suspension meant for smoothness.  The SE also comes with some extras like a spoiler, sport rims and tires (17 inches and darn lovely), and a really cool dashboard once you get used to it.  The GLE is equipped with a wood grained interior, climate control,  and an upgraded sound system (a very full sounding Bose stereo with CD).

If you're looking for the most car per dollar, stick the the GXE.  If you want a really expensive feeling car at a not so expensive price, get the GLE, it's as nice as the baby Benz (C class) and faster than a BMW 528!  My personal favourite though is the SE, of course that's probably because I am a speed freak and this car delivers soooooo much for a car of its size.

Who should buy this car?  Let's put it this way, my dad bought one, that's probably the highest praise the car could receive.  Between my pouring over all the information I could find on it and my dad, the engineer, going over all the technical information, we bought it.  I'm also recommending it for a buddy of mine (27 year old male) who currently owns a Honda Accord and likes the space because he's always got 3-5 people in his car.  He also wants a 5 speed in a V6 sedan, which is surprisingly hard to find. It's for someone with a family or just a desire for a safe reliable sedan.  It's also for those who haven't given up on life ie: driving pleasure.  Another feature that most people won't tell you is that it's less common on the road than some other cars.  Most people are hooked on the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry, the luxury versions of which are it's nearest competition.  Both are great cars for sure, but the Maxima to me SEEMS like a bigger, more classy car.  Definitely not run of the mill.

It's 3 biggest competitors out of the following list are the Acura, the Mazda, and the Saab.  Others to consider are:  
-the Accord and Camry (both very popular)
-the Infinity I30 (same platform, more expensive but even prettier and classier) 
-the Acura 3.2TL (slightly more expensive but easily its stiffest competition, definietly check it out) 
-the Mazda Millenia (highly underrated car, also definite competition)
-the Volkswagon Passat (prettier to some, but not as quick) 
-BMW 3 series and Audi A4 (Both smaller and nimbler)
-and the SAAB 9-3 (one of my favourite Euros, huge cargo capacity)

On the American side it's competition is: 
-the Buick Regal (pretty powerful in it's own right but definitely not for the younger crowd) 
-the Chrysler Concorde (if you like the styling, I still don't trust the build quality)
-Lincoln LS (more expensive but from what I hear a great car) 
-Oldsmobile Aurora (just plain big, not too sporty, i liked the old one better)
-Pontiac Bonnevile (wow, has it gotten uglier than last year?).


That's my round up on this great car.  <br><br>
