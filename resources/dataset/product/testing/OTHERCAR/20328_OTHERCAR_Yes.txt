            My roommate, Tim, came home late Wednesday night to tell me of the untimely passing of his 1986 Civic.  It seems the camshaft had disintegrated mid-turn, and the rest of the engine went with it.  The estimate came back yesterday at $3000 for a new engine, and today we were out cruising the strip in Auburn looking for a used car.  The last place we entered was Herb Chambers Hyundai.  

We were greeted by Nick, who had completed Herb Chambers Sales Training, and after trying out a 1997 Elantra (review pending), we found a blue-green 1996 Altima with about 46,000 miles on the clock.  It was one of three cars on the lot with a manual, the only kind Tim will buy.  It was obvious that the previous owner had abused the car's interior, and the exterior was a bit tired, but mechanically, the car was in decent condition.  

On the road, the car handled decently.  Engine performance was more than acceptable, considering the weight of the Altima, at over 2,800 pounds.  The manual transmission was in very good condition.  The clutch had held up surprisingly well (it could have been recently replaced, as well -- Nick didn't go out of his way to explain it), and Tim let it slam more than a few times along the way.  Braking was forceful, yet smooth, and the car dipped surprisingly little considering the rear drum brakes.

The car moved nimbly through a number of moderately aggressive turns, but the Altima's long wheelbase crippled it in a U-turn.  Used to his 86 Civic Hatchback (turning radius about ten feet), Tim took the whole car off the side of the road before getting it back.  On the highway, the car showed it's one flaw.  

The previous owner of the car had let one of the wheels stay completely out of balance for at least 5000 miles, and it shook terribly at 70 miles per hour.  I believe it was the right front.  When I inspected the tires back at the dealership, both front tires were overly worn on the outside.  If Tim decides to pursue this car, I'm definitely going to recommend he have a very thorough inspection of the front suspension performed, just to make sure it didn't do any other damage.  

Apart from the poorly balanced wheel and the two worn tires, the Altima appeared to be in very good mechanical condition.  According to CarPoint, the 1996 Altima has above average reliability in all areas surveyed, and that is essentially what we found with the Altima.  Under the hood, the engine was in very good shape.  A little rust and corrosion was apparent on the exhaust manifold, and in very small quantities on the strut mounts.  The belts showed their age a little bit, and would have to be replaced.  The underhood layout was fairly ergonomic, however, reservoirs were not color keyed to stand out.

Inside the car, I was very pleased with the high placement of the climate controls.  The upper dash mounting of the unit was placed perfectly to keep eyes on the road in constantly changing New England weather, and the controls were very clearly marked.  I would have liked to have seen a confirmation light when the air conditioning was turned on, but was otherwise very happy with the design.  Window and mirror switches are conveniently located on the driver's door, and the layout of other controls is very convenient.  The overly long shift lever leaves a driver's hand in just the right position to adjust the radio. 

The Altima does have a tilt wheel, which is important for my 6' 5&quot; roommate.  Rear seat room, despite the overall size of the car, is very cramped, especially behind a taller driver.  Storage is plentiful in the car, although it lacks any kind of pockets in the rear seat.  It has acceptable front storage pockets, and glove box, as well as a large armrest compartment.  It lacks a folding rear seat, however.  A pass- through opening allows access to the ample trunk.  

The one area in which this car had suffered was in finish and trim condition.  The interior of the car was quite dirty, with several permanent stains, and the exterior had a number of light scratches.  The trim on the outside of the drivers door, at the rear edge, was starting to disintegrate.  

Overall it seems the Altima is a very durable car, based on this example.  The previous owner had obviously had at least one child, and the permanent damage to the car was limited to the appearance.  For a lower-midlevel sedan, the Altima has a lot to offer to those seeking an inexpensive, moderately roomy car.  It's no Maxima, but it's not chopped liver either.
