            First let me tell you buying this was a &#145no-brainer&#146 for me.  I already own a FD-87 and would have bought another one if I could have found one.  Don&#146t get the wrong idea, there&#146s nothing wrong with the FD-87.  It&#146s just that we don&#146t share well so we needed another camera.

The absolute best thing about these cameras is the storage in JPG format to floppy.  Last summer&#146s vacation took us though most of NY state.  Everyone&#146s house we visited had a computer but not everyone would have been thrilled if we needed to load software and connect devices to them.  Using the floppy made it easy to view and share our pictures with whatever they already had.

Learning to use this camera was easy.  It has a few more options than the FD-87 but we didn&#146t have any problems using it either.  The instruction manual is GREAT!  It explains all  the menu options and really helps if you&#146re not getting exactly what you want from your pictures.  I keep the manual right in the bag with the camera but most of the time, if I have a question, I just ask the kids.  They have never read the manual but can work the menus better than I ever will.

Battery life is pretty good.  I can get anywhere from 60-80 pictures one a single charge.  That&#146s over 2 hours of continuous use.  If you need longer, invest in another battery pack (I did for my FD-87).

The 1.2 mega pixels makes and awesome 5X7 picture (I got a great one of the &#145new&#146 NY skyline from Liberty Island).  The &#145email&#146 function gives you a smaller version of you photo that&#146s great attaching to email and a full size version at the same time.

The 6X zoom is more than adequate.  The only time I&#146ve wished for more was at a concert and I had to sneak up front for a close-up.

Downloading from the memory stick through the USB is simple.  It gives you the option of taking more pictures without swapping out the floppy.  I use it mostly for the MPEGs.
