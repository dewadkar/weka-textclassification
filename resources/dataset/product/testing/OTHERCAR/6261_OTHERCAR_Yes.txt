            I bought my Extended Cab 3-door Sierra about 2 months ago.  I was moving off to college and needed to trade my Caramo in on something a little more useful.  I looked at all of the other trucks by ford, toyota, dodge, and the like and just couldn't find anything that appealed to me as much as the GMC.  At first I liked the Chevy grill better, but after taking to several people there are in fact several advantages to a GMC over a Chevrolet.  For starters the major cosmetic difference is the grill.  Now on GMC the grill is more open and does allow for a lot more air to get through.  I haven't heard any complaints about overheating Chevy's but if you do a lot of hauling or hard driving you just might need every little bit of airflow possible.  The other major difference in the two trucks and more practical to everyone is the headlights.  The GMC headlights are larger than the Chevy's allowing for somewhere around 40 feet more visibilitly at night.  Now that's worth something to everyone.  Plus a GMC comes standard with more options like front tow hooks for example.

The Chevy's are damn good trucks but mainly for the headlights and airflow I opted for the GMC.  I have been told that the GMC's are typically cost a little bit less than the Chevy's.

The best deals are on the 3-doors right now.  All I cared about was that it needed to have at least one external way to get to bench seat so the 4-door was not worth an extra couple thousand bucks.  The sticker price on my truck after taxes was a little over 29,000.  I actually took it home for 20,500 with my 2,000 trade in.  I could not deal that well at all with the 4-door models.  They are phasing out the 3-door so now is the time to go steal you one.  Another good thing about these trucks is you can buy one for just about any price range.  You can pick up (hehe) a single cab for 12,000 or so or you can go all out and spend in excess of 35 grand.  It all depends on what you need out of a truck.

I got the 5.3 liter engine in mine.  It puts out a awesome 285 horsepower and strong 325 pounds of torque.  The extra engine over the 4.8 only is 800 on a GMC so I would definitly go for it.  The gas mileage is very close on the 4.8 you get 16 cty and 21 hwy. and on the 5.3 you get 16 cty and 20 hwy.  I personally have gotten about 23 or so out of it on the highway.  It's got plenty of power and you never need to get it past 2,000 RPM's in everyday driving conditions.  You can cruise a easy 75 at 2,000 RPM's.  It can get up and go as well.  I have seen the numbers on this engine on the 0-60 and I believe that it was 7.8 seconds.  I can say that it would out do my Camaro in performance anyday.

It drives and handles great a whole lot better than my father's 98 dodge.  He loves it and wanted trade me for it the day I got it!!

I would recommend this truck to anyone.  It has plenty of room in the extended cab to carry kids or adults.  I'm 6'2&quot; and I'm very comfortable anywhere in it.  

One thing that I can say to vouch for this truck is this.  The day after a friend of mine took a ride with me he went out and bought himself one!!

If you're interested in a truck you owe it to yourself to give it test drive.  O one other thing I almost forgot.  The truck has a lumbar support built in to the seats.  I have a bad back and some auto's kill me to ride even short distances.  With my GMC I just crank that little knob and I'm as comfortable as can be.

Go for a ride....You won't be disappointed<br><br>
