            My parents bought this car new when my mom needed "cheap" but reliable transportation. She hated the color, but loved the handling and roadworthiness. She went from a high performance Chrysler LeBaron GTS, to a plain Jane sleeper.  When they offered the car to me in 2001, I jumped on it. I had driven this car many times, and a few times in the snow. I can honestly say, that I had never driven a car that could handle snow like this one. When 4X4's were getting stuck, sliding out of control, and just plain useless, this car would putt right along. Hey, even bald tires don't keep this baby off the road. The winter of 2003, was one of the worst in PA history, but this car got me to work and home every time.  If you live in a snowy area, get one of these, its a lifesaver.

Pickup wise this car is very strong with its 3.0 6 cyl. engine. I have always said that Chrysler knows that horsepower is only as effective as the low-end torque that should go with, and this engine has both in spades. The tranny is long wearing with no problems seen at its present 132k miles. In fact the only real issue with the car is the fact that it does have a valve knock at startup and burns a bit of oil. Fuel efficiency wise, it is average at about 20-25 miles/gal. 

I only have a few issues, other then the burning oil is the fact that the driver's side headlamp seal is faulty and moisture gets in under the cell, and this has allowed algae to form inside the headlamp and that the car has an quirky problem turning right. Every once in a great while the car will just stall when I turn right at speed. It starts right up, and goes right back along. Also when the weather is damp or rainy, the car will have stalling issues, tho this seems to depend on if the gas tank is full or close to empty. Full, no stall. Empty, can we say two-footed driver?
