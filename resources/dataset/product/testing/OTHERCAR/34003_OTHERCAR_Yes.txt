            Don't go by the picture! Mine looks a lot better. My Toyota Tacoma LX 4x4 Extra cab has 17&quot; wheels and rides higher than the one pictured on this page (looks more like a real truck).

I purchased it used with 35,700 miles in April of 1998 after my previous SUV had been stolen and totaled (see my '93 Isuzu Rodeo opinion). Now it has over 81,000 miles on it, and still runs great! There were brand new tires on it when I purchased it, in fact they still had those little pointy things still on them (the spare still does!) Other than that I have replaced nothing major, and only had one serious problem.

<b>PROBLEMS</b>
About one year after I got it, while driving the temperature gauge shot way up when I stopped at a stoplight. When I took off from the light it would go down to a more normal reading, but when I stopped again it shot up to the top. OK, problem! I immediately took it to the Toyota dealership, which fortunately I was less than 500 yards from. They found a blown gasket that was under <b>recall</b> which kept all of the oil inside the engine (boy do I have some luck with oil leeks or what!). So they repaired the problem in only a few hours with no charge.

That is the only major problem I have had with my truck. I recently had a minor problem with a pair of contacts within the starter being worn out and needing replacing ($61). I found out that the towing capacity is only 3,500 pounds instead of 5,000 pounds.

<b>PERFORMANCE</b>
The Tacoma has a V6, so it has plenty of giddyup. The ride is like any other pickup. There is also a slight lean when cornering, noticeable only to those who aren't used to it. Gas mileage is not good, 16mpg in the city, and 18mpg at freeway speeds (especially in these days of sky high gas prices). The 4WD feature is louder and not recommended for anything other than off road. It is accessed by a smaller gear shift next to the manual stick with an indicator light on the dash. 

<b>INTERIOR</b>
The interior noise level is tolerable (depending on tires and speed). There are two fold down seats with seatbelts in the extra cab. I have not been in another Tacoma, but the cloth bucket seats are comfy enough. I did drive cross-country by myself when I moved out west enduring four 12-hour days behind the wheel. There is not enough room for 3 adults across the front seats. Only two adults and a small child might fit.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
I love my truck! I recommend this truck to anyone who can use it for it's intentions; off road, hauling, and snow. These trucks hold their value and the engines last forever. I have heard reports of people typically getting well over 200,000 miles on one engine. I'm planning on running mine into the ground.<br><br>
