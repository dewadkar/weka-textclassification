            Due to a malfunction in my IXLA camera that I bought off of home shopping, I needed to get a different digital camera. I mainly use mine to list on Ebay and I needed one with good picture quality. I found this camera at my local WalMart and paid just over $200.00 for it. I was so excited when I got it home and out of the box! The software that comes along with it is very user friendly. Despite what others have said, it does not really take that long to download the pictures. Also, heeding prior warnings about it being a battery hog, I shut it off each time I will not be using it for an extended period and it seems to do just fine on battery usage. The camera fits fabulously in the palm of my hand. I have taken several pictures with this camera and I have to say, I love the picture quality. So far, none of my pictures haven't turned out grainy or discolored, etc. 
Needless to say, I love my camera for the price but I do have one major concern. That being there is no instruction guide! I have had my camera for about 2 months now and I still am not aware of how to use all of the features. I've heard that there is a manual to download of the polaroid website but that is too much hassle for me.  Eventually, I'll be able to master all of the features of my camera but I do not want to take the time to print off the manual! For that reason and that reason only, I have graded this camera four stars rather than a perfect five. 
I would suggest this camera for anyone who uses it to list online auctions and it's great for family outings as well. <br><br>
