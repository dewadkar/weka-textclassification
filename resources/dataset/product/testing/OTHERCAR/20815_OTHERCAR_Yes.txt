            Okay, my new Mazda6 is still very new, but this review is a testament that you do not need to drive one very long to fall in love with it.

I am not going to go into the details of the Multi-link suspension or any other manufacturer specifications.  Go to http://www.mazdausa.com if you want that, or read some of the other epinions here.  They do a very, very thorough job.  I am going to hit on the things that most people are going to notice about a new car.

My car is a Mazda6s, with a 5-speed manual transmission, comfort package, and appearance package.

What does that mean?  The following are the amenities of my car, some of which are standard, and some of which are part of the package.

1.  Manual Transmission (I will never own another automatic)
2.  Leather Seats
3.  Climate Control
4.  Heated Front Seats
5.  Tilt/Telescoping 3-spoke steering wheel. (Standard)
6.  Steering wheel mounted radio controls
7.  ABS
8.  Traction Control
9.  Speed sensitive volume settings for the radio
10. Lots of storage room and GREAT cupholders.  (It holds the now-ubiquitous 44oz. cups so well that you can thrash around a curve without spilling!)
11. Center Console auxilary power outlet
12. Great fold-down rear seats, spring loaded to fold on their own.
13. Trunk hinges that do not intrude on trunk space.
14. Security/Alarm system.
15. Remote Lock/Arm
16. 4-year, 50,000 mile warranty AND roadside assistance

Here's what I like about it:

If you love to shift, you will not be disappointed with this car.  Throttle tip-in is a bit on the slow side, but the shifter works with a nearly Honda-esque precision.  This is important because a) The Honda V6 is NOT available with a 5-speed manual transmission, and b) the new Honda is BUTT UGLY.

Since I mentioned looks, and this is an opinion, I will say that the Mazda6 is <b>BY FAR</b> better looking than any of it's competition. 

The feel of quality.  Go to a dealership and open the doors.  Close them.  You get a solid, satisfying "THUNK".  Same goes for every control you touch in the car.  Solid.  Precise.  It oozes the feeling of quality.  Another review complained about wind/road noise.  I do not have that experience at all.  My other vehicles are a Mazda MPV and a Nissan Maxima (which the Mazda6 is replacing).  The 6 is much quieter than both.  Another review said: 

"...But: In order to get the leather interior, you MUST BUY the Power Roof AND the full airbag package, so instead of being an 860 option, the leather interior automatically becomes a 2230 dollar option...".  

That is not true.  I have leather and no Power Roof (which I don't care for) and just the standard airbags.  Like all cars, certain features come in packages, and dealers pick cars that have combinations that they think they can sell.  From a production standpoint, building a car to order costs more than producing standard package-based cars.  His dealer picked cars that had combinations of options he did not want.  Do your homework and decide what you want.

Speed:  This car is fast.  I thought my '96 Maxima was quick, but this is a rocket.  I frequently find myself going 80 on the highway without realizing it.  Is it faster than a new Maxima, Altima, or Accord?  Probably not.  But it is more fun to drive than all of them because what it gives up in horsepower it more than makes up in handling.  It is the driver's car of the bunch.

Comfort:  Mazda has their seats figured out.  They are firm, supportive and well contoured.  In a Maxima or Altima you tend to have a sit-on-the-floor-feet-in-front-of-you seating position.  I much prefer the Mazda configuration, which lets you bend your legs to a comfortable angle.  The back seat is not as big as some others, but for average-sized people it is just fine.  I am 5'10" tall.  If I adjust the front seat for myself, and then sit behind the front seat, I have plenty of room (3-4") of leg room.  If you are tall, and have tall people to sit behind you, or frequently carry four passengers.....get a van.

Stereo:  Go to Edmunds.com and read the review of the standard stereo.  They rate it as very good, and I concur.  I did not option up to the Bose system, in part because that car had an option package that was not covered by the financing incentive.

Take all these qualities and give it a sticker of $23,720.  Price a similarly equipped Altima and it comes out to $26,188.  The Accord is $26,260 because you can only get Leather with the EX, and there are no options and no stick.  You get the EX as it is.  Now, I was able to get mine down to $22,100 ($400 over invoice), AND I got $1000 cash back for Mazda Loyalty, AND I also was able to get the 5-year, 0% financing.  THAT was the deal-maker.
