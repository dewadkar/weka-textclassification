            Our Forester has been everything that was promised by previous reviews and research. ABS Brakes work like a charm, stopping fast in straight line on gravel or wet roads. Cruises comfortably, and has plenty of power to zip around slower cars at highway speeds. Handles much like a sports coupe, but has good (not great) carrying capacity. But the roofrack is always there for the long trips or for outdoor activities like kayaking and biking We've had it offroad over a weekend on the Outer Banks, driving in some nasty soft and rutted sand. Lack of clearance was really the ONLY thing to look out for. 

With the S, the Geolanders have a pretty good treadwidth to start with, so I only dropped them to 19psi all around. The car went EVERYWHERE the big boys went. And yes, I stayed out of the deep ruts hear most of the time, but even when I got into them, I did not or feel (or see) any really bad &quot;surfing&quot; by the bottom of the car on the hi-center. I've spent lots of time driving jeeps, vws, etc on bad soft beaches, but the one thing i really liked about the Forester was the ride: It smoothed out the ruts and bumps like no truck every could. 

However, I would strongly suggest replacing the plastic &quot;skid-plate&quot; under the engine with a steel one and I upgraded the stock lighting system (pretty poor) to H-4 bulbs with a new wire/relay/bulb kit. But this Forester does seem solidly built, the leather seats feel, smell, and look great, and I'm getting an overall 27mpg in city/highway combination driving. No complaints from this Subie owner.

To those of you who don't belive the Forester is an off-road vehicle,, i got news for you:  Its A Winning Drive!!
