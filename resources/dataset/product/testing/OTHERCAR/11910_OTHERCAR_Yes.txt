              After tons of research and endless nights of of checking out cameras online I stumbled across the Agfa Ephoto 780c. I was looking for a camera that had better than 640x800 resolution, and that was low in price.  This is the perfect camera for the average person or even a person who has a little artistic edge.  This is a great camera for someone whos buying their 1st digital.  It has more options on it than most entry level cameras Including 4 different resolution modes up 1024 and as low as 320.  It can hold over 96 images on its lowest setting and 12 at highest resolution. 
  The software on this camera is great, it almost instantly displays the image on the LCD after the picture has been taken.  I have a friend who has an Olympus 360, and it is much faster than that.  The LCD is cool because it can also be used as a view finder, almost like a camcorder does.  The Software to put the images onto your computer is very capable and decent for editing.  It can also be connected to a TV to display a slide show although I havent tried that yet.  It connects to the computer through the serial port, which some people consider a drawback but I like, because it leaves me open some USBs.  	
	The camera also comes with 4 flash settings and 3 different view settings, keeps time and date, and is a pretty attractive blue and silver.  All in all I love this camera, I got mine on Yahoo auctions for only $105 Brand New, and havent had any problems! So if you take the time and shop around you can definetly find a good deal, I think most were going for like 140-150 which i almost paid before being outbid. Either way its worth it for what you get.  The Camera takes 4 double A batteries. The only real draw back is, it can eat batteries pretty fast if you love to play with the LCD, but thats to be expected with most digital cameras, so im looking into buying some rechargeables.  So if your considereing Digital Cameras the Agfa 780c is definetly one to look into.<br><br>
