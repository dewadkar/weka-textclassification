            Pros:  - A very affordable family car. 
       - The car gets very good gas mileage
       - Seats are very comfortable for long drives
       - The car has a good look,  not a sport car but at 
         the same time not grandfathers car.
       - Acceleration in the V6 is very nice
       - Other than brake problems no other major parts 
         had to be replaced.

Cons:  - The automatic shifting is very rugged in my       vehicle.  When it shifts from 1st to 2nd the car does not shift smoothly into gear like it should.  It has happened since we purchased the car used with 50,000 miles on it.

       - My car has had brake problems for the last few years.  (this could be due to the people who work on the car but we have gone to at least 2-3 different garages).  

      - I had a terrible time hearing the music in the car.  The front speakers point toward my feet so you have to turn the music up louder to hear it better.  It basically defeats the purpose of having speakers in the front of the car.

      -  And like someone else has said,  the cup holders are bad.  I don't even have a cup holder in my model!  Also I personally don't like the rotating vents in the center,  you cannot move them manually once you press the button to stop them from moving.  (Basically stupid design in that aspect).
