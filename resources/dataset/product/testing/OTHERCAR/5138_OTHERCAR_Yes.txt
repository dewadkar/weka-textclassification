            The 2000 Dodge Dakota Quad Cab is an excellent vehicle for families who need a pick-up truck.  We've had our Dakota for 2 months now and are very pleased with it.  It is roomy enough in the back seat for two car-seats and a weekend's worth of luggage.  The back seats fold up, too, so you can load up groceries on a rainy day.  

At first, the shorter bed might pose a problem, but we were able to load it up with all the materials necessary to install a chain-link fence around our yard.  This was no small task, either, but the weight was no problem for the small truck.

The model we own is the 4x4 with the 5.9L engine.  It is a powerful little truck that gets very good gas mileage - even with a bed fully loaded with firewood.<br><br>
