            We bought a Subaru Impreza Outback wagon new in '95 for $15,300.  It now has 72,000 miles on it with only one repair, new front brakes at 70,000 miles.  It has been flawless otherwise.  We have had most maintenance done at the dealer.  Having no other new cars, I can't say whether the dealer is charging a lot or not, but the car has performed without any problems through several Massachusetts winters.

We have the larger 2.2 liter engine, automatic transmission, AC, am/fm cassette.  The Outback trim gives you some zippy looking exterior items and a great rubber floor mat for the rear cargo area, a small, but very nice touch.  

The car drives well, lots of low-end torque for quick starts. It has less power at the top end but never feels dangerous on the highway as some small cars can.  It is incredibly stable, almost to the point of feeling slow but it actually moves along.  Many Impreza owners are driving enthusiasts and seek the car out for its handling.

The all wheel drive is unnoticable till you get in ugly weather and then it shines.  Though I don't try stupid things, we have never gotten stuck with this car, even in heavy snow.  Twice, in fact, we've used it to pull other cars out of the snow, one a similar sized station wagon and the other a mini-pickup.  The Impreza is not meant to be a tow truck but this is a good testimony to it its rock solid ability in snow.  Feels very safe.

For a station wagon, it is quite small.  The top of the cabin is narrow and the rear hatch is  sloped, cutting into cargo room.  If you have huge amounts of stuff, this may not be the car for you.  That said, with the standard roof rack and a few modifications by me, I can carry both my tandem bike and a roof top luggage carrier safely on the roof, making loaded trips possible for us without buying a minivan.

My main complaint about this car is the road noise.  Since it was new, it has felt like you could hear a lot of what the wheels and the wind are doing under the car.  Perhaps this is similar to other similar cars in the same price range, I don't know.  But that is the only complaint.

Gas milage has been in the high twenties to 31mpg.  Pretty good for a somewhat heavy small care.

Impreza wagons have become a lot more popular since '95 and I think their durability, stability and handling are the cause of that.
