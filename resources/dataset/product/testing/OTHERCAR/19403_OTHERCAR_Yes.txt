            I have a black 99 Honda CR-V and I love it.  I'm into sports utility cars and I think that my car is a cute sports utility car.  I've wanted this car for a while and I got it from my parents.  It rides smoothly.  The car is roomy and has a lot of cupholders.  There's windshield wipers for the back and of course, as well as the front.  My car can sit five different people and the 3 in the back can also recline the chairs and not have to sit up straight straining their backs.  I like my car because it seems very homey.  It's very easy to maintain and clean.  It's not as high as other utility so it's easier to clean the car and was the top of the car.  It also has a roomy trunk.  It came with an alarm that unlocks the door when you turn the alarm off and locks the doors when you turn it on .  It is also impossible to lock your keys inside because when you try to lock the doors inside and then close it, it'll unlock.  That's much easier because you make sure you put the alarm on when you're outside.  And for sure you have you're keys with you and it locks the door.  I like my alarm. The only thing I don't like is that the passenger side doesn't have an arm rest to the left and there is an arm rest for the driver.  Anyway, =) This is a cool car.  <br><br>
