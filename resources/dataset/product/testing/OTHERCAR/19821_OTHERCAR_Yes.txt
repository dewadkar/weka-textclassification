              I've owned several different makes of cars in my lifetime; a used Dodge Colt, a new Ford Fairmont, a used Toyota Corolla, a used Nissan Sentra, and a new Nissan Sentra GXE.  But, none of them has compared in reliability (and fun) as the new Toyota Paseo I bought in 1996.
  All of my previous cars had trouble, practically from day one.  With the two new ones I bought; trouble started within one year.  My supposedly, nice new Sentra GXE (fully-loaded) had electrical problems galore.  So much so that I was afraid to drive it anymore for fear that I might be locked inside someday.
  I never intended to buy the Paseo.  I went in for the sole purpose of trading in my Sentra GXE for a reliable, cheaper model of car.  When I saw that Paseo sitting on the showroom floor, it was love at first site.
  To be brutally honest, the first thing that attracted me to the Paseo was the looks.  Secondly, I checked to see that there were no electric windows, locks, cruise control, etc.  I didn't necessarily have to check its track record as I've known that Toyotas are good cars; that's why I wanted one.
  Since 1996, I've taken my Paseo in for its routine &quot;check-ups&quot; as prescribed under warranty.  The only things that have been performed at this date (12/99) is your basic oil/filter changes, rotation of tires, and routine checks to make sure &quot;all systems are go.&quot;
  My &quot;toy&quot; is the greatest to zip around in; that is if you like zipping around in a sporty looking, 5-speed car.  The sound system is great, the ride is comfortable (maybe not for back seat drivers -- a little short on leg room back there), all controls are accessible, and it has two front airbags for safety.
  And, on top of all that, even at nearly four-years-old, it still draws attention (it doesn't have that boxy, rear-end look of previous Paseos).
  Of all the cars I've owned, the Toyota Paseo is the only car that I want to keep forever!  Who knows, maybe someday it will be a &quot;classic.&quot;<br><br>
