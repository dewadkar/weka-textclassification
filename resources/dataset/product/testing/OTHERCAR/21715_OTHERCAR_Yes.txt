            I recently purchased a 4 door Chevy Cavalier and I'm definitely lovin' it. I commute an hour to work each way and the seats in this car make for a very comfortable ride. The four cylinder engine has plenty of passing power and still averages around 36 miles to the gallon, a definite plus for economics. I have driven 25,000 miles since I purchased this car and have not experienced any mechanical problems. The fold down rear seat and large trunk are a definite plus. The wife and I can load up the groceries and not have to worry about room. The down side is rear passenger leg room. I have the seat pushed back for driving comfort, and it really does not leave much room for someone behind the driver's seat. Small children are a different story though, my 4 year old daughter has plenty of room. And the rear door child safety locks add an extra feeling of security when she's in the car.  With the anti-lock brakes and front wheel drive, driving in the snow and ice has proven to be quite easy. This was not the first choice of a car I would have bought, but I am definitely glad that I bought this one.<br><br>
