            It's hard to believe that I own the same car that people have given such glowing reviews for.  When my husband and I were starting a family, we looked for a &quot;family car.&quot;  The Cherokee seemed to be the most popular SUV around, and NOT being mini-van people, we decided to check them out.  It was 1997, and we found a 1995 Grand Cherokee (Orvis Edition).  Not being fishermen, we were nevertheless drawn to its &quot;curb appeal.&quot;  It's a beautiful shade of green, with burgundy and beige trim; the interior is tan, with wonderful retro-like tan and green leather seats with burgundy trim.  We bought it, and it's been a nightmare.

From Day one, the air conditioning has never worked properly; we spent $1000+ two summers in a row, and each time it would work for about a week.  It only worked for about 3 days last summer, and no one can tell me what the problem is.  Mysteriously it's working (so far) this season.  The brakes have been a problem, and we are not hard on them.  The cargo blind worked only once, and there have been a myriad of annoying little problems along the way.

We can hardly wait to replace this vehicle, and are planning to upgrade to a Land Cruiser or Lexus LX 470.<br><br>
