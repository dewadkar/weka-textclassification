            I bought this car to sell it because I got such a good deal. That is the only way I'll buy.  This car had 143000 miles on it and ran like a champ. It was a ex-fleet car for an airport and always had regular maintenance.  It needed a wax job and hubcaps (It had 3 miss-matched ones).  It is burgandy colored with wine red cloth interior and the very fake wood trim inside. No rust, and one small quarter sized dent on front right fender, hardly noticeable

The hood release was broken but I fixed that no problem.  I also put a set of hubcaps on that are replicas of the originals because the originals fall off so easily.  And they cost about a ton less. You can get 4 replicas for the price of one original.  That was all I did to it. 

Everything worked on this car.  That was a nice first for me. I don�t like the base gauge cluster with all the dummy lights, but it's better than some. I noticed that this car could really handle.  I had a Bonneville before which handled great but this could run circles around it in turning radius.  I never could make a full U-turn before our road.  It just cuts through the wind like a knife. County dump trucks and semis don�t make this car budge when they roar by it.  The only problem was the weather stripping was making a whistling sound at around 50 mile�s per hour.  If you are getting this car opt for the 15-inch aluminum wheels.  They look and grip much better then the standard 14-inch.

Also the doors are heavy, for some reason, and the 2-door�s are really heavy.  They make it hard to just let close, you have to give them a firm push.  I wish that the trunk lid opened at a 90-degree angle.  I�m 6 foot and have banged my head a few times.

The brakes wear out quick but there is a trick to make them last.  By putting the emergency brake on it realigns the brake pads taking pressure off of them when parked.  Just make sure your parents know this when they borrow the car! 

I know it sounds like I hate it but I don�t.  I just want to get those minor things down for your benefit.  The radio is strong and the antenna got in stations I never heard of before.  The 3.1 Liter engine was responsive although not a speed demon.  The seats are comfortable for a while but supportive enough. The interior is real roomy; almost makes you feel like the car is full size.  But it was fun to drive and a great car for a young kid.  I know other kids who have them and like theirs too.  One has a dark red �91 Euro coupe with 129000 miles and the other has a black '90 base sedan with over 200000 miles.  Theirs run excellent also.
  
I sold mine one month after I bought it, put nearly 1500 miles on it and would buy another in a heartbeat.  It wasn�t the best, but for the price I paid it was a great car. 

I give it a 9 out of 10
