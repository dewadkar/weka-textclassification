            I received this product as a gift but I know the purchase price was $299. I would have paid twice as much to get such quality. I have had NO problems with the camera OR software in over a year. The quality of the pictures is excellent and the features are very useful. The 3 levels of picture quality come in handy although even on the lowest setting the photos are quite good. The camera seems very rugged considering its high tech nature. Another nice feature is the option of using the rear lcd screen OR the regular view finder for taking pictures. I think most cameras don't give this choice. the 4 aa batteries drain quickly when using the flash and the lcd. I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a simple, hassle-free digital camera at a very reasonable price.<br><br>
