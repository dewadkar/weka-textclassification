            I bought my Toyota Tercel over 11 years ago as an in between car. 
Today I still have this car. With over 179,000 miles -and still running. Has never left me out in the cold or hung up some where far from home. Excellent Bumper system front and back with a heavy duty frame that has with stood 3 hits to this day. This is a Small Car, not elegant but a great starter car for the teen driver, or as a quick run car.  Excellent on Gas Milage and Part Replacement. The folding down of the back seats, and the old &quot;rumble seats&quot; in the front gives to old fashion feel of a great car.  Has plenty of room to move all kinds of items.  This Toyota Looks Small But Has Some Definite Advantages to the Newer Larger Cars, Comfortable Bucket Seats, Un Complicated Dash Board and Plenty Of Front Leg Room. Being a 4 cylinder is the best for over hauling the engine and tune ups are very reasonable. 13&quot; tires gives the chance to pick up the &quot;Tire Specials&quot;  in the neighborhood without paying a fortune. This is an Excellent Vehicle in my opinion The Older Cars are The Best Cars.
And as Small as it is the Toyota Tercel Year 1982
 ... can park this baby any where as it is a Great Small Car !!
Only Con here is the rear Hatch, you must lift in and lift out to get items for the rear &quot;trunk&quot; area. Can be a hassle for the person with &quot;Lumbar&quot; Problems and Lack of Muscle Strength. And is NOT power Steering! Got To Work For This Steering, Keeps You Arms In Shape !!<br><br>
