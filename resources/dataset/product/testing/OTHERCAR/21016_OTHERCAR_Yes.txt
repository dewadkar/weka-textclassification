            I bought the RAV because of Toyota's reputation for reliability, but I love it because it's so fun &amp; easy to drive. It zips onto the freeway, it turns bumps into almost nothing, it handles more easily than a toy.

My husband talked me into buying the RAV, but I love it so much, it's hard to hand over the keys when he wants to borrow it!

I can't think of anyone who shouldn't buy the RAV, unless they are a member of a family of 6 or more. The back seat holds two car seats, or three passengers (without car seats). There is plenty of leg room &amp; storage room in the back.

The back door opens really wide to accommodate whatever you need to put back there.

Have fun, buy one, &amp; don't say I didn't warn you! Driving the RAV is addictive!<br><br>
