            The Plymouth Neons are nice cars for the money.  They give a great ride and are comfortable.  They have a lot of room inside.  We own one and have three children.  One with a car seat, one with a booster seat, and one that uses the seat belt and there is still room to spare.  My kids have never complained about being cramped.  The engines are also great on gas and are dependable if taken care of.  Body style is eye catching.  Our car is used (1995), have had it for almost one year and have had it in the shop once.  Nothing serious or expensive. Easy to heat for those in cold climates.  We actually get too warm while traveling.  I recommend this car for families as well as single people.<br><br>
