            The Sony Mavica FD-73 is a good digital camera that offers the convenience of using floppy disks as the recording media, allowing quick and easy transfer of files to the PC. The camera does not produce the kind of high quality mega-pixel pictures that are becoming more common these days, and if you're interested in state of the art equipment, you should consider an alternative brand or model with higher resolution capability.

In doing considerable research on this subject, I settled on the FD-73 for the following reasons:
1. I use this camera mostly for business.
2. I didn't want to be bogged down by carrying an extra cable and installing extra software just so I can upload pictures from the camera to the PC.
3. I take pictures with this camera that will be sent, via e-mail, to others in my organization.
4. When I want to take high quality images and utilize the new PC technology to manipulate and print out high quality pictures, I will use my existing 35mm film camera and either a flat-bed scanner or film scanner.

The 640x480 jpeg format pictures come out crystal clear and perfectly exposed. There are a variety of additional effects that I can utilize if I want to, such as B&amp;W and Sepia toned pictures, but I can't really think of a reason why I would. The 10x zoom provides a wide latitude of focal lengths that make it easy to compose the proper shot. 

The only negative so far is that I'm not getting the advertised number of minutes per battery charge. While I should be getting two hours per charge, I seem to be getting about half that. As soon as the battery is charged, the camera displays 110 min. of use available. With about 50 minutes left, the display screen dims and while you do have the indicated amount of time left, the dimmed screen makes it difficult to see, thus the need for a recharge. However, I have used other brands of digital cameras in the past and have found similiar problems with their batteries as well.

All in all, almost perfect for my needs, with the exception of battery life.<br><br>
