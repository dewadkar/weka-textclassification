                 Two weeks ago I took delivery of a 2000 Buick LeSabre Limited with the Prestige and Gran Touring option's package's and the leather seating area's. The outside color is silver and the inside color is grey. The option's include 10 way power heated driver and front passenger seats, rain sensing wipers, electrochromatic inside and driver and passenger outside heated mirrors, rear view mirror compass, traction control, audio and hvac controls mounted on the steering wheel, and 16 inch touring tires. As of April of this year, the OnStar navigation system is standard on all LeSabre Limited's.

     The engine is Buick's standard 3800 V6 workhorse.  This engine has been around for decades and it keeps getting better. It has 205 horsepower and a large 17.5 gallon gas tank. So far, after driving 1000 miles, mostly on highways, my average miles per gallon is 29.  The engine accelarates smoothly and shifts gear's flawlessly.  The seat's are very comfortable for both children and adults. The trunk is a huge 18 cubic feet and swallows anything that you can put inside of it.  

     The only negative comment that I have about this car is the lack of variety in it's exterior color's.  I can honestly say that I love everything else about this car. This car is just perfect for families. It is a real people mover that does not drink alot of gasoline.  Go for a test drive and see for yourself why this is the best family sedan in both value and comfort for under $30,000 that you can buy today.
