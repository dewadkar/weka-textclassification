            Before I graduated high school, I started looking for a car to buy.  I had little to spend and I didn't really know what was "out there".  I went around to different used car dealers, trying out cars and testing the waters.  I heard so many bad things about different companies, and I started to worry.  From the beginning of my search, I always thought Saturn had cute cars and I wouldn't mind having one.

Nine months later, I had saved up more money to spend on a car.  Looking through ads, I spotted a Saturn.  It was appealing to the eye, was about the perfect size for someone who did not have a lot of driving experience.  There was nothing worse than learning to drive and having to drive a big car (I had driven huge cars, and didn't like it!).
I ended up buying the Saturn.  It lived up to my expectations.  It is of course, a sedan, and handled well even in snow.  I was surprised especially seeing large cars sliding around in the icy conditions.  The interior was comfortable and simple, yet accommodating.  I used my car to travel all over the Northeast, and not once did I have to worry that my car wouldn't start up.  

This car lived up to all my expectations, and more.  Bumps and dings, true to Saturn's claims, were virtually nonexistent.  The hood, roof, and trunk were metal, but the doors and bumpers are plastic, making the car very resilient to the "bumps and dings".  

I brought the car with me to college, and fit any "rugged needs".  It's not a racecar, you aren't going to get what you would out of a V-8 engine, but it's definitely a great car if you compare it against others in the same class/price range.  You can't buy this car and expect that you are getting a BMW.  I ended up trading in this car for another Saturn, which was even better than before with some minor updates and improvements.  The cost wasn't ridiculous for a college student like myself.  There have been no recalls, no problems.  

The staff at Saturn is great, they listen to what you say and are very accommodating.  Just like in the ads, Saturn has quite a reputation- in fact, I read in a Car & Driver magazine that at some point, Saturn was rated as having the best customer relations out of any car company.  I've gotten free Mets tickets in the mail, along with t-shirts and free food at the games.  There are pool party invitations on the bulletin boards at the dealership, along with pictures that people send in, cards, and other shows of customer satisfaction.

The dealership is also a very nice place.  There's free food, a kids play area, a nice seating area with TV and other things to keep you busy.  Also, when I got my second Saturn, even though it was used, you go through their "hall of fame"- a large indoor area in which they drive your car into.  The car is cleaned until spotless, they put a ribbon on it, and you stand in front of your car.  Then they make an announcement over their intercom, and every single employee comes into the hallway, singing and cheering.  You have your picture taken with all this going on, and a few weeks later in the mail you get a laminated calendar with the photograph on it.  You can go back each year for free calendar refills.  So Saturn has a big selling point on their customer service.

This just goes to say that an economy car doesn't always have to be cheap (or unsafe), value-wise.  The only downsides of the Saturn SL series is that some of the things in the car are of cheap quality.. console and dashboard materal, door panels, and so on.  I didn't care because I didn't want to have to worry about destroying a luxury car with my lifestyle!  I was used to throwing my muddied car mats into the washing machines and doing other quick clean-ups.  

I really loved the interior of the car.  I personally thought the seats in the SL2 were really comfy, and the whole interior just seemed "cute".  The only thing that got to be annoying was the small cupholders located in the console.  The cigarette lighter was right in back of the cupholders, and if you put any drinks in the cupholders, it would block many of the controls.

Another thing to consider, which is part of my "update" below- is that NOW, I realize Saturn does not offer many options.  I guess this makes this car more appealing to those who want to buy an inexpensive car.  There are so many Saturns out there without power windows, without power locks, without even a cassette player.  You have to buy a power package if you want anything with the "power" option.  If I remember correctly, it was about $2,000 extra, because many of the used Saturns I looked at did not have the package, and if they had it, they had no CD player or other nice options.  Yuck!

"Update"- I now own a different car.  I decided go to a school much further from home, and needed a station wagon.  I thought, easy enough, I would take my car to Saturn and just trade it in.  I had a 1997 SL2, low mileage, in PERFECT condition.  Not a spot on the car, perfect condition, perfect maintenence records, nothing wrong with the car in any way at all.  So I compared my car to a 1997 SW2 (Saturn wagon) with the same specs. The wagon had about the same mileage, options, etc.  It even had some scratches and the interior had some stains.  I'm thinking, this car has about 60 pounds more of metal and glass.  When you compare the wagon against the sedan, you basically cut the trunk off the sedan and put a top on it.  
The two cars are virtually the same.  Not to go off on a tangent, but when people are all freaked out about wagons and complain "they are so much harder to maneuver"- well, thats the farthest thing from the truth.  The car is exactly the same dimensions other than height in the back.
So anyway, I sat down with a Saturn salesperson, and we went through the whole trade-in process.  I had bought my car a year earlier, and had put on about 20,000 miles.  They took about 1/3 of the price off the car.  I understand that if you sell the car on your own, you get more.  But this was A LOT DEDUCTED.  WAY TOO MUCH.  The same car, but I would be paying over $7,000 in trade in.  Of course they don't "Haggle" or "Hassle" so I was left without a chance.  I took the car elsewhere to sell it, even though I was on an extremely short time budget.  
I was extremely frustrated in that the two cars were basically the same value.  My sedan in perfect condition vs. a wagon in not as good condition with the same specs.  There was no way I was getting ripped off.
