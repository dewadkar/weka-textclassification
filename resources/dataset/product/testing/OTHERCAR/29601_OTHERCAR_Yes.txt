            I purchased my 1995 Mazda MX-6 LS in 1998.  I was looking for a reliable, nice looking, &quot;not bad on gas&quot; car for my wife and I to drive. 

I liked the sporty looks of the car and the ergonomic styling of the car-although the back seat area is built for &quot;smurfs&quot;.
The 2.5 liter V6 engine that comes standard with the LS package is quite a power house.  Coupled with the fact that the car is light weight, the car hauls!  Gas mileage is directly proportional to how  much pedal you use.  Around town I can expect about 20 mpg.  Interstate is around 25 mpg.  If gas mileage is a major concern, opt for the 4 cylinder version.

Now for the downer.
The V6 engine is near perfect-except for the distributor.  Mine recently bit the dust.  I have done research and found that Ford/Mazda knows about  the defective distributor--specifically the transistor in the pick up coil within the distributor.  See for yourself at www.alldata.com
The 1993's and 1994's are very prone to this defect, although 1995's are not immune-much to my dismay.

By the way, price for a replacement distributor is about $525 US!
And no it is not re-buildable or available as an after-market product.

In closing, If you can get a good deal in a Mazda mx-6, go for it!  Just remember you may have to replace the distributor, and at over $500 it could set you back quite a bit.
Good luck!
