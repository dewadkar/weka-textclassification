            The Infiniti G20 is a classy little car that offers a smooth ride.  It is roomy enough to fit four adults comfortably.  The G20 engine offers the power of a V-6, and that little &quot;get up and go&quot; proves to be a lot of fun.  For the driver's in the Northern Hemisphere, the G20 handles itself very competently in snow.  

The trunk is roomy, offering a little net pocket/pouch, that helps to hold loose objects in place.  

My only complaint would be the cup holders.  They are difficult to access, and fairly impossible to use. I have been told by Nissan (the parent company of Infiniti) that new cup holders will be available in the new models.

All in all, the Infiniti G20 is a wonderful luxury car at an affordable price.<br><br>
