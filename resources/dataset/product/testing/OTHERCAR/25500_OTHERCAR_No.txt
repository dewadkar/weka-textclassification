            I bought my 99 B3000 4x4 (extended cab w/bedliner and 5speed) in May to replace my first 4x4 pickup, a Toyota.   So far the truck has done well.   

Mechanically:
It's been reliable and has never left me stranded.   It hasn't developed any weird leaks or quirks.  It always starts right away in the coldest of weather.   The 4WD always engages quickly and without a problem, and the 4WD switch is easy to reach.

Cosmetically:
It's got a nice look to it, nicer than the Ford Ranger (which it's identical to except for some trim and options).   Mine is a nice dark green color which has yet to peel, rust, or discolor.  I used my truck like a truck, for hauling things, and admittedly I've already removed the paint in several places on the bed.   I wish the paint was a bit more scratch resistant.  

Ergonomics/Layout:  
The interior is laid out well and looks as nice as any comparable truck.  The seats in my opinion have got to be some of the most comfortable seats I've ever sat in.   Mine is the extended cab version and the room behind the seats is larger than I expected.

Performance:
Unfortunately this truck is very underpowered, even more so than my old 4 cylinder Toyota pickup.  It was a big disappointment considering it's a 6 cylinder.   I'm also very annoyed at the gas mileage which is worse than some huge SUVs.  I've already had the truck checked out repeatedly and tuned up, but nothing helps.  Gas mileage is terrible (14 mpg mostly highway miles / rated for about 19 according to the EPA).  Nothing I do seems to help the gas mileage despite the truck being a 5speed.   I shudder to think how much worse the speed and mileage will get if I try to pull a trailer with it.

There are however some things I wish Mazda would fix:
- break off their partnership with Ford and go back to making their own vehicles.  Car buyers already have too few choices
- the paint could be a bit more scratch resistant
- the ride is a bit noisy but then again this is a truck (and I do have the big-tread tires)
- access to the extended cab for lack of a better word, stupid.   The space is large but you can't get a decent sized suitcase back there without sliding one seat forward, leaning the 2nd one back, having a helper angle the case, and doing a whole lot of pushing.  The seats need to slide forward more and/or lean forward more.   
- the seats are also difficult to get exactly back into place once released to get behind them.   It would be nice if they had some sort of memory where they'd snap back to the same distance and angle they were before.  Also watch out because the rails are very sharp and right next to the big lever you must push to put the seat back.  Ouch!
- price could be better, but then again all 4x4 trucks are way too expensive
- weird security system supposedly does deter thefts but to get a 2nd key made will cost me at least $100  and can only be done by dropping the truck off at a Mazda dealer

Overall it's a nice truck and it's taken me halfway cross-country without a problem.    I really does need more power and/or gas mileage, and that is the main reason I wouldn't buy this truck again.
