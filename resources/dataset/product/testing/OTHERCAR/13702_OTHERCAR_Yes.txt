            The 99' Mazda 626 ES V-6 is a well loaded vehicle for it's priceline.  We are &quot;in-love&quot; with our new Mazda.  The V-6  170 hp 2.5L DOHC with 24 valves powers this car very well, I felt a 4 cyl. was inadequate while test driving and researching.

Shifting is smooth, acceleration is top notch.  The ES model is the top dog in it's class with 15in. all season tires that grip the road sweetly.  The interior compares with a $30,000 luxury car.  Equipped with soft leather seating that I must say ARE one of the most comfortable front buckets I've ever sat in.  A Bose sound system with CD is fine tuned and makes for a great drive. Instrumentation is well placed and easy to reach. It has swing vents which are awesome for a hot climate such as Florida!  The back seating area is large enough for two tall grown men with plenty of leg space.  Remote keyless with a anti-theft are all standard.  Interior lighting goes on when remote is activated, nice.

One of the selling points for us was the room for a baby seat (infant) in the back and the ease of removing it through the back door with no wheel well in the way.  I can fit two strollers in the oversized trunk and we have put 3 large suitcases and carry-on bags to boot!

The downside to purchasing a 99 model is Mazda does NOT offer roadside assistance, a big Ouch!
This car does not compare with the Ford Contour or the Mercury Mystique (they boast it's sameness)..........they are much smaller!<br><br>
