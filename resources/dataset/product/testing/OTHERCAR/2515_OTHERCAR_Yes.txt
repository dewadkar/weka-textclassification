            I ordered my 1991 Corvette Convertible with just the options I wanted.
Leather interior and Hardtop / Softtop and nothing more.  I didn't need
to spend an extra $1,000 for the BOSE or and extra $1,000 for the Sports
seats.  I was already paying a hefty price (8,000) for the hardtop
convertible that once upon a time for believe it or not $150 cheaper
than the T-top Coupe (check out the prices in 1975).  I had already
owned 2 '59 convertibles, a '65 two top roadster, and a '69 convertible
so I knew just what I liked.  Top down, wind in your face, go fast
Corvette.   Nothing else matters once you're behind the wheel.  If Chevrolet could just bottle this stuff they wouldn't have to build cars anymore!  Thank goodness not everyone agrees, or everyone would be buying Corvettes.   Well, it's almost ten years later and it's a beautiful day here in the &quot;Hill Country&quot; and it's time to take the cover off the Vette and go catch some rays.  And for every red-blooded High School Boy/Girl that loves the Corvette, finish school and find that Corvette.  Go into hock and buy it as soon as can and enjoy it.  You over go around once and you'll never regret it.  I haven't and I've been driving one for over 30 years!!
