                Now my jeep is not brand new it is a 1997 jeep cherokee 2 wheel drive sport. Now it may not be new but for the most part very little has change in three years. The jeep I drive is my work vehicle I work for a local law enforcement dept. as an license and weight officer(inspect commercial motor vehicles).

 For three years I have put the cherokee to the test, driving it at top speeds of 114 mph , driving into and out of ditches ,creeks ,and over all types of debris. The biggest problem I am having at this time at 60,000 miles is the suspention a lot of problems with the front end ,usually a loud popping noise sometimes when making sharp turns 
. Another problem is the weight of my portable scales,200 lbs causes stress that is causing the back end to sag. These problems where fixed but after two attempts at it . Replacements are as follows,battery,fuel injector rail,water pump after 30'000 miles,shocks , brake job front and rear,trans. problems hard shifts,various electrical, fuel pump and a few minor fixes. As far as comfort it lacks in many areas, interior noise is bad,interior space is small, seats could be more comfortable an all plastic interior that is cheaply made . I have concerns with overall size of the vehicle if involved in an accident, thin doors.  Well please understand that I drive the vehicle harder than most due to my job. I would like to add that as far as handling it has a fairly low center of gravity compared to the other suv's and beleive me I have put it to the tes.. Thank and good luck shopping..<br><br>
