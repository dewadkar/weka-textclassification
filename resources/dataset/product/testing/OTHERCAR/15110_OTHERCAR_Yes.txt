            This year I bought the 99 Nissan Altima GXE Model.  I actually did not like this car nor did I want to buy it.  But I was sweet talked into getting this car.  My first impression is that it rides well.  I like all the features that you are getting with the car.  Then interior is actually set up quite nicely.  There are no overly large buttons that seem to draw away from the interior design.  The space inside of the car is average.  The car itself is just average nothing really catches my attention.  When driving there is minor wind noises coming from the door areas.  But otherwise it is a quiet ride. 
     The problem that I have faced with this car is that soon after I purchased it the brakes started to sqeek.  For a car that is not even a year old is seems as if that should be one feature that you should not even be concerned about.  However, the braking portion of the car is absolutely wonderful, although at times my brakes sound like a bus is coming.  The brakes come in handy for the bumper to bumper traffic that the Silicon Valley is known for. The car is nice it just lacks ability to handle high speeds. 
     I have noticed that can travel long distances without the gas meter dropping, the car really gets good gas mileage.  I can go about 22 miles before a quarter of a tank drops.  Overall, the car is a just an average car for your average driver.  Personally, I would recommend it to college students, senior citizens, single families.  <br><br>
