            The Vivitar 3615 it's a nice little camera, the first time I held this camera felt really nice in my hands, very well built, feels durable and lightweight. I love the ease of use and the fact that I can use my PocketPC's 256 Megabyte Viking Compact Flash on it so I can shoot hundreds of pictures and watch them on my PocketPC bigger color screen and manipulate the photos on site. 

It comes with great software like MGI Photovista for 360 panoramas and MGI Photosuite II SE for retouching, special effects and more. It's USB compatible and you can hook it up to a TV or VCR.

I didn't like the fact that you don't have optical zoom (just a fake 2X digital zoom, which only works on the highest resolution 1600x1200 because it crops the image and you will get a 800x600 image in it's place) and also that it's very easy to get blurry or out-of-focus pictures at lo light levels.

I used to have an Olympus D-400 1.3 megapixels and when I compare the picture quality the Olympus D-400 blows the Vivitar 3615 away! (I think that the 1600x1200 resolution it's nothing more than a 800x600 native enlarged realtime to 1600x1200 because you will notice some grain and artifacts even at the highest quality/Least compression setting when the ambient light is low)

The bottom line is that all in all it's a great entry level 2.1 megapixel camera.

P.S.- I'm almost certain that this Vivitar 3615 (which is exactly the same as the 3620) it's also the same as the Samsung 2.1 megapixel camera since both have the same LCD, Functions, Thumb Wheel, Symbols, and features, just the media used are different.
