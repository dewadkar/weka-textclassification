            Fasten your seat belt because this 4.1 Megapixel camera from Sony will sell faster than anything else out there and be in high demand.  Expect feature after feature...

This is my third digital still camera.  One Nikon before this and a 'combo' camcorder/digital still camera (DSC) as well.  I was first in line for Sony's DSC-S85 and took mine home on day 'one' of its release.

I'm spoiled on 'digital'.  Imagine not buying film.  Ever.  Imagine not having to wait for processing, picking up and taking film in and then getting back only 4-5 decent prints out of the entire roll of film you took.  No second chances and besides, you have to conserve that film because it is costly.

Better yet, let's store all the negatives into envelopes (I'll never find that negative anyhow later because after thousands of them, it's lost for sure) and purchase 'albums' for all those prints that really didn't turn out that well after all.

Film is obsolete.  Processing is obsolete and slow and about as much fun as renting a video and then having to return it.  For an extra $15.00, I can have all those prints I didn't want to keep placed onto a CD-ROM that I'm sure not to play later.

Now on to 'digital'.  I realize most of you already know that digital is superior in certain respects (and not in others).  However, I'm writing here for all of you.  First-timers, novice and experts.  Even those that may have been turned-off by digital in its initial stages.  Those old 1.1 megapixel cameras are history as Sony introduces its first 4.1 MEGAPIXEL Digital Still Camera.

Digital will offer you the ability to take shot after shot and 'delete' the pictures you don't need or want.  Battery life will be 2-3 hours or hundreds of shots before a simple recharge.  You'll be able to email them or print them off your PC/Printer. Better yet, you'll be able to 'upload' them to various sites that will 'process' those pictures you really want on Kodak paper into 4X6's or 8X10's or even larger with this Sony DSC-S85!  An excellent site to visit (now) is:  WWW.SHUTTERFLY.COM  .  The day you upload to Shutterfly, the print is done within hours!  In the mail to you.  Simple and easy!

Features are of little use here in this review because you can obtain them at WWW.SONY.COM  .  You can also obtain them and other reviews at  WWW.CNET.COM  .  Those sites will list everything for the 'techs'.

My DSC-S85 has already been to Hawaii and California's Wine Country.  Bright sunlight, sand, water, airplane-interior shots and night shots of Hawaii sunsets.

Performance from my DSC-S85 was excellent.  I pushed it hard and made it work.  Time between shots I took and time to 'catch' something with little warning as I turned it on.  It was just as fast as any 35MM I had used in the past.

The clarity is 35MM quality.  The Carl Zeiss lens only then enhances that quality and this 'single feature' is one very worth mention here...  Sony cut no corners.  I expected this camera to sell for at least $1200 and it comes in at list for $799!  For 4.1 megapixels.

Superior battery life and that wonderful 'Memory Stick' format are other major features.  A quick recharge for its built-in flash, a timer, close-ups, MPEG and clip motion and if I keep going here, I'll do exactly what I said I wouldn't.  Go look up the features on your own.

Any cons?  Yes.  The Carl Zeiss lens is a 6X zoom.  Half of that zoom ability is 'optical' (true zoom) or 3X.  The other half is 'digital' (compressed zoom).  You'll ruin the quality of the photo when you use 'digital' zoom because the camera is cutting off what you are shooting to compensate for the fake and extra 3X zoom.  Sony knows this and has made available a function from the menu to 'TURN OFF' that digital zoom.  Yet I would have preferred Sony to have included a better optical zoom.

I found the Sony manual easy yet others have not.  I had to read it several times and I made mistakes with initial use but it is set up much like other Sony products and ease of use is quick to come.

You can also accomplish MPEG and CLIP motion shots (video) but those take up a ton of space on your Memory Stick.  Use a camcorder instead.  Keep this as your dedicated 'Still' camera.

4.1 Megapixels is all you'll ever need.  Beyond that and there is no reason.  So this camera should be good for many, many years to come.

This is another great Sony product (I do not work for Sony-promise) and your investment for the DSC-S85 will be a positive one with memories stored on your computer or made into CD's by your computer system and stored with ease.

Right now, it is the BEST digital camera for the money (actually the best money or not) and I encourage you to look into it if you are considering upgrading to the digital world!  Enjoy it!
