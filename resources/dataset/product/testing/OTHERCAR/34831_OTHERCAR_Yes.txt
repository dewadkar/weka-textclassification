            Who would have guessed a &quot;mommywagon&quot; could be cool! Decked out with all the &quot;bells and whistles&quot; this mini has major attractions.

Just on looks alone this vehicle stands out among the rest. No longer the boxy styles of before, gone are the days when you looked like you were going on a space mission. This van exudes style and class. 

Honda has topped themselves with the new and improved version of their Odyssey. The swing open back doors, which made loading and unloading children somewhat difficult, have been changed to automatic, remote sliding doors. A luxury any mother should love. The 1999 model was low to the ground making driving uncomfortable ( though only slightly), tha 2000 model is raised slightly, that much improving the already smooth ride. The cargo space in the rear has also been increased, making carpooling with the kids a breeze.The most interesting feature of the van is the fold down rear seat. eliminating the need to remove a heavy cumbersome seat in the event you need extra room. Another plus, the &quot;hole&quot; the seat folds into makes a perfect space to put groceries.Keeping them snugly in place. No more will you have to chase the cans around.

The only thing wrong with this vehicle is the avialibilty. Although improving, production rates were low, and in most of the country there is a four to six month waiting list. If your lucky enough to find a Honda dealer that has them on his lot take a test drive (even if your not in the market).Your in for the ride of your life!!<br><br>
