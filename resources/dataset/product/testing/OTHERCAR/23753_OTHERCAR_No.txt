            I LOVE my car. At least, I did. I bought the car during Summer 1997, and I didn't really have any problems with it until the last month. In the last month:

1. My airbag light has come on and will NOT come off.
2. My cigarette lighter got stuck and burned out all the electrical workings inside that socket, so I can no longer plug in my emergency battery starter or CD player.
3. The battery died. It's SUPPOSED to be guaranteed, but NO. I was forced to shell out $50 for a new one.
4. The trim is falling off BOTH of the front driver's side and passenger side doors.
5. The exhaust pipe needs to be replaced.
6. The gas gauge continually says the gas tank is full when it isn't, then drops to EMPTY... usually when I'm on I-70 en route to nowhere, U.S.A.
7. My left headlight went out. I took it to the Volkswagen dealer 100 miles away (the closest) to have it replaced. I asked about the other headlight. They said it was fine. At 5 p.m. I began the drive home. At 6:45 p.m. I was pulled over. My right headlight was out.

FINALLY, yesterday was the last straw. I went to stick a tape in the stereo, and it wouldn't go it. I got an Er8 message and the thing just DIED. I can get use the radio, but the stations here in the middle of Midwestern NOWHERE are terrible. 

If this weren't enough, my acceleration is VERY slow and it takes me a while to get the car up to 70 MPH, which on our highways is NECESSARY.

Take it from me... the warranty isn't all that it seems. This car was PERFECT until recently. Now, I feel like I'm driving a lemon. Somebody get me a Toyota!<br><br>
