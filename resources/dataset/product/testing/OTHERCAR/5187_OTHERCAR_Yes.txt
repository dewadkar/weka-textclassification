            Before buying this Honda Accord EX V-6 Coupe, we had already decided to purchase a Honda motor vehicle because of our positive experience with them in the past.  This is the seventh or eighth Honda we've owned, so it was primarily a decision of which Honda.

Prior to this Honda, we had several Accords and one Civic, all four door models.  Since all the kids have left the nest, my wife wanted a more &quot;sporty&quot; model this time.  She had her eye on the Prelude, so we looked at them, drove them, and compared the Prelude with the Accord EX Coupe.  The Prelude is a very fine motor vehicle, and we determined that it is in fact a sporty car. But the Accord Coupe is, in my opinion, more refined and &quot;classy&quot; (like I think my wife is).  

We've had it about a year and three months, and like all previous Honda's, we're very pleased with it.

Although my wife is the primary driver of this car, I get to drive it occasionally such as when it needs gas, washing and servicing.  

I'm over six feet tall and used to driving my GMC Suburban, so I do have a harder time getting into and out of the Honda.  One thing that helps very much is the power seat.  It has up and down movement to the front and rear of the seat, and back and forth movement to the seat back plus lumbar support adjustment.

Also folks, with the 200hp V-6 engine, this car has a respectable amount of acceleration.  It also has four wheel disc brakes, and they're very efficient at stopping the car from highway speeds.  The factory tires are of excellent quality and size, and add to the overall handling ability of the car.  I'm a retired Maryland State Trooper and I'm still a part-time EVOC instructor, so vehicles that perform well and are safe to drive are important to me.

There is really nothing I hate about this car.  It's just a darn good automobile.  Honda does a very good job manufacturing their vehicles.  Our last Honda had over 113,000 miles on it, and it gave us no major problems.  It's still owned and driven locally.  I expect to get at least that kind of performance from this car.  

Whenever I drive the car, I feel that should I get into a situation which might require me to take evasive action which would require the vehicle to respond at above average expectations, this car will do just that.

My wife drives about 30 miles round trip to work, partially on Interstate 95, and she does some around town driving.  The gas mileage is almost always 24 to 26 miles per gallon.  We've driven it on a couple longer trips, and the car will get 27 - 28+ miles per gallon.

Another thing I like about this vehicle is the quality of the interior materials and the exterior paint.  This car is black, as is my Suburban.  I've washed and waxed them both on the same day, and it seems that the Honda stays cleaner looking longer.<br><br>
