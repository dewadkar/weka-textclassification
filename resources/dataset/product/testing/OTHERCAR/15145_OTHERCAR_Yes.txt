            One large reason to buy a Pontiac Grand Am GT is that they are a great car with sporty looks but gets great gas mileage.  These cars get nearly 35 mpg on the highways and get 25 mpg while driving in the city, and that is for a 3.1 litre V-6!  

Not only does the car look sporty, they have a stiff suspension system which makes it feel like a more aggressive sports car.  They come with wider tires and are a very affordable sports sedan.  This car is a great buy, where you can get one used for not more than $10,000 for a '96 model with 50K miles on it.  

Mine was a steal when I got it in 1998 when it was listed for $13K and I walked away with it for $10,500 cash with ONLY 20,000 miles on it!  It was the BEST investment I have ever made.  Great mileage and a great car!  It looks great and handles awesome.  They have a great speaker system which is a plus and the handling is more stiff which makes it feel aggressive.  The deeper bucket-like seats are great because it also makes it sporty.  People who are looking for a car for college or high school or economy with sports look should buy this car.  It is a well spent investment.  <br><br>
