            I bought this car when it was 8 years old from a friend's grandfather. Since then, I drove it from Florida to California (the LONG way), and have had close to zero problems with it. It runs smooth, doesn't shake and gets good gas mileage for a car of its age and size.

The only problems I have had was the A/C unit dying on me, otherwise its been a dream...

I thought we'd have trouble going up mountains and hills, or possibly overheating in the desert. Nope. 

We even drove up in the mountains to Mount Rushmore where it began to snow, and this auto took it all.<br><br>
