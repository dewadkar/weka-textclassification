            My wife has had her heart set on a Ram Air Firebird for a few years now, and finally her dream has come true.  She took delivery of a 2001 Pontiac Formula Firehawk #121 on October 31st.

For those that don't know what a Firehawk is, I'll explain.  When you order a Pontiac Formula or Trans Am and specify option code WU6 you get a very special limited edition car.  The order goes through just like any &quot;normal&quot; Formula/Trans Am but before it gets shipped to the dealer, it makes a stop by Street Legal Performance(SLP) for some modifications.  They change the hood and front bumper cover, the wheels and tires, the exhaust system, and suspension.  What you end up with is the highest horsepower rated F-Body (GM's designation for the Camaro/Firebird) available from the factory and the closest thing to a Corvette without a Corvette price.  The really neat thing is all the modifications are covered under the factory 3/36 warranty.  By the way SLP is also responsible for modifications done to the SS Camaro but the special exhaust included with the Firehawk is extra cost on the SS.

I drive a 1988 IROC Camaro everyday so I was interested in the difference in feel between the two.  There is no comparison!  The Firehawk makes my Camaro feel like a toy.  While the Pontiac does feel like it sits up higher than my Camaro, the Firehawk out corners out accelerates, out stops, and gets better mileage than my IROC.

Granted there is no room for normal sized passengers in the back seats.  As a matter of fact it's even a tight fit for my two year old son in his child safety seat.  Also the hatch area does not allow for much cargo, the seat back will fold down but not with a child seat installed.  This is NOT a family car (we own a 1997 Astro Van for that purpose).

The ride is what I would expect from a sportscar...stiff but not punishing.  Most of the controls are easy to find and use except the rear hatch release which is somewhat hidden on the bottom portion of the dash board.  The radio controls located on the steering wheel make it VERY easy to change stations or volume without taking your hand off the wheel.  There is a power outlet along with a cigarette lighter but it's somewhat blocked by the parking brake lever when the parking brake is in the released position...not the best of designs.  I find the shifter (it is a 6 speed manual) to be a bit stiff and &quot;notchy&quot;, my wife think's it's perfect but we both agree the clutch is just right.  The Firehawk does exhibit more road noise than I expected but I think it's mostly due to the agressive tread pattern on the Firestone Firehawk tires (which are part of the Firehawk package).

This car is not for everyone.  If you are looking for a smooth, quiet ride this is not your car.  If you want lots of room or need to carry people and cargo, pass this car by.  If you want great overall performance in a car you can drive everyday and don't mind the downsides to driving/owning one of the last remaining muscle cars...take a look at the Formula/Trans Am/Firehawk.<br><br>
