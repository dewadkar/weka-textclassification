            I had a Maxima, so I thought that I would not be impressed by any little, environmentally-friendly, hybrid car.  After all, the engine had to be comparable to a rubber band, right?  And it was so small.  I was very wrong.

The first test drive and I fell in love.  The car is like the Tardis (for those of you who watch Dr. Who)--much bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside.  And it has plenty of get-up-and-go, particularly with 1-2 people.  However, the car does operate on its light weight, so you can really begin to tell when 4 people are in there with the trunk full (still not bad, but you can tell).

I had to wait 5 1/2 months for mine to be ordered.  Now I have had mine for 21K miles and average 50-55 mpg in mixed city/highway driving.  It has a computer that tracks and graphs mileage (up to 10K miles, if you like; it's resettable).

The most important thing:  do not believe Toyota on the proper pressure for the tires.  Their recommended pressure will cause uneven tire wear (though a softer ride).  I keep my tires at 47 psi each and have had no problems at all (they are rated at 50 psi).

Even with the engine running and highway speeds, it is a very quiet car.  Has plenty of amenities (map lights, touch-screen radio controls, CD, tape, AM/FM, 2 odometers, etc.).  The speedometer is centered on the dash, rather than on the steering wheel, which takes about 30 seconds to get used to.  Tall folks might be uncomfortable driving.  I am 6'0" and have no problems--taller folks might.

It is a very green car.  For example, the gas tank is a bladder, so there are fewer vapor emissions.  But this is the really impressive thing:  it is a "real" car.  The computer controls the hybrid system and the transmission (it has a CVT, which means it has no gears).  You just put gas in it (well, very little gas) and drive it.  No sacrifice or special attention is required.  Very nice.
