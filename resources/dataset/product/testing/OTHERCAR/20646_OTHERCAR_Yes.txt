            I purchased my 99.5 Audi A6 Quattro in August 1999.  After much comparison with other automobiles, the A6 turned out to be the best(and best value).  Comparisons(ES300, BMW 528, MB C, 300M, BMW 328, S80)

There were significant rebates when I purchased my car MSRP of $42,200, purchase price $36,000.  I had every option on the car(which is many).  The car has one of the most beautiful/comfortable interiors(only car that came close was the Volvo S80).

The car is VERY solid and quiet.  It has adequate power off the line, and very good passing power.  The 99.5 has the same stereo as the 2000, which is an improvement.

The steering provides good feed back, and is very light.  This is not a sports car feel, although the car does handle very good when pushed (the tires squeal early, but provide good feedback).  

The light steering was one of the reasons I purchased the car.  My wife has weak wrists, and this car is very easy for her to maneuver at highway and parking-lot speeds.

The car has many more options and standard features than any other car out there.

Problems:  The only abnormal problem I encountered was a sunroof switch which would not always respond.  It was replaced 3 times, and then the sunroof motor was finally replaced(this has resolved the problem).  The sunroof never was stuck open or closed, the switch just had to be initiated twice in order to open the sunroof.  This was more of an annoyance than a car halting problem.

Very pleased and happy at 11,000 mi
