            I contemplated purchasing a small/midsize SUV for a while. I previously had a Ford Focus wagon, a very nice, practical car, but a little slow, and not very capable in off road adventures, or able to tow much of anything. Also, I was looking for something with a long warranty, and something that would hold up decent resale value. The Focus lost 50% of its value in the first year and a half!
<p>
My first thought was the Ford Escape, as I have a good track record with Ford Credit, and am able to get really good financing deals through them. The downside of the Escape, and other vehicle in its class, were the car based build and FWD, along with the standard 3/36 warranty on the Ford.
<p>
Unfortunately, Consumer Reports did not recommend the KIA Sorento. It appears that CR is not a big fan of SUV's with a full frame, preferring only small/midsize SUV's built on a car chassis. Also, fuel economy took a hit with CR. This made me fret a bit more and remain undecided for a while.
<p>
I finally went into a KIA dealership and took a LX 4x4 out for a test drive. I was mightily impressed! First impressions, prior to even driving one, were of a very well built and appointed vehicle. Fit, finish, and attention to detail was excellent. Close the doors or tailgate, and it makes that very solid quality sound, not at all tinny or thin as in some vehicles.
<p>
On the road, the KIA felt very solid. The ride is firm - there is no mistaking that you are in a truck. This is what I expect in a SUV. It is not overly harsh as reported by CR, but solid and firm, with good control of body roll. Power is strong and smooth, and the auto transmission shifts smoothly. Brakes are firm and confident. and, you sit up high with a commanding view of the road. The cabin is well laid out, with easy to reach controls. The quality of the interior is easily that of a Lexus - not at all what you might find in a Ford or GM product in this price range. The standard sound system, with its in dash CD player, is very nice. Power windows, locks, tinted windows, 4 wheels disc brakes, alloy wheels, 245 70/16 tires (beefy), AC, cruise, heated/power mirrors, remote entry are all standard features
<p>
So I bought one. A silver LX. I had only wanted 4x2, but was talked into 4x4, the reason being it would likely hold its resale value better. I am glad I went with the 4x4. Can't wait to try out its offroad capabilities somewhere.
<p>
I think KIA has built an outstanding SUV here. It is really going to give the competition a run for their money. And I also think they are taking a gamble on the full frame. It seems the plusher car based SUV's are all the rage, but I think KIA was going for the upscale look and quality of a Lexus or Acura with the off road capabilities of a Jeep. I would say to anyone before buying a SUV in this class, test drive the KIA before deciding. The only downside that I can foresee will be fuel economy, but in reality, we're only talking a few MPG difference between the KIA and other in its class, and in the long run, I'd prefer the longevity and solid feeling of a full framed SUV over a couple extra MPGs
