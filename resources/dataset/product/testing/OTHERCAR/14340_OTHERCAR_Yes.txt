            After my first car burned in flames and my second car just about lost front wheels I knew it was time to by a new car.  But, that's another story.

My dad suggested to me a Nissan Altime since he had a 1996 Nissan Altime and never had problems with it.  I thought that Altima was in my price range.  So, I decided to try finding a car that could match what Altima had to offer.  I decided to look at Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, because I thought that is the type of cars Altima would fit in with.  I didn't compare it to Civic or Corolla because I think that Altima is a bigger car.

I went to Honda, Nissan, and Toyota dealerships and couldn't find a car that would match what Altima had to offer.
Here is what I got with my Altima for 16,050 and 3.9 financing for 5 years:
Cruise Control
Power windows and locks
CD player
Air-conditioning
Automatic transmission
and the rest is standard, like wheels, seats, and doors :)

So, these are the options I tried to find in Accord and Camry for 16000.  I saw an Accord for 16400 that didn't have:
Air-condition
Cruise Control
Automatic Transmission
Power windows and locks
CD player

Same goes for Camry.  

Altima had a lot of improvements since 1996.  

1) Horsepower increase
2) Frond middle elbow rest is raised
3) More interior lighting
4) Sun blocks have mirrors
5) Interior space increased
6) Quieter ride

All these improvements tell me that Nissan listens to its customers, because I know that those improvements cold have been made on a 1996 Altima.

After I rode in Altima I knew that it was a great deal for 16000, because it rode very quietly, it had a lot of improvements since 1996, it was affordable, reliable, and it was fun to ride in.  Plus, it begs for me to ride it.  Only one little thing puzzled me about Altima.  It, doesn't have a lighter even though it has two lighter outlets.

I would recommend this car to anyone who can afford a 16000 dollar car because it is a great value for its price.

So, I say, go out there and get yourself an Altima
