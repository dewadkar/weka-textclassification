            Ah Toyota. Make decent cars that last forever, but they&#146re a bit mumsy aren&#146t they? They have a whiff of barometer and leaky bladder about them. It&#146s not that they&#146re designed for the old, the nervous and the A to B brigade it&#146s just that they attract them. And despite the move into F1 there isn&#146t really a great deal of sex to the marque &#150 no PlayStation rocket to which a young guy might aspire. Mitsubisi have the Evo, Subaru have the Imprezza WRI, Honda have the S2000 &#150 what do Toyota have &#150 an MR2 designed primarily for suburban hairdressers without luggage and the cheap train station taxi of the future Camry.

Of course the people over at Toyota are mightily clever. In Japan they were heavily involved in one of the maddest youth brands ever, Will, joining a conglomerate that made youth everything &#150 from Microwave ovens to cars via insurance. In the US they&#146re taking a less radical approach to their lack of youth magnetism problem and launching a specialty youth marque &#150 Scion. Now unless my English fails me (and it often does) a Scion is a descendent of royalty &#150 making the xA a little Prince of a car. Well does it hold up to the promise, can it attract the &#145reflect my personality&#146 crowd that Toyota needs if it&#146s going to continue making gains in the US?

In a word &#145No&#146.

And here&#146s why. The Scion xA is a nice little car. But it&#146s a sensible little car. It&#146s a Toyota. A Toyota with a squiggly badge to be sure but there&#146s absolutely nothing about it that says &#145Must Have&#146 &#150 except perhaps the price &#150and that advantage is eroded when Scion put the boot in and empty your wallet for those essential personalized accessories.

That said &#150 let&#146s get to the details.

Appearance

Upon approaching  the xA I was immediately put in mind of two cars not available in the US but popular throughout the civilized motoring world. The first is Toyota&#146s own little hatchback &#150 the Echo. As a hatch it&#146s a beautiful little car, squat, full of purpose and cut to look as though it&#146s straining at the leash. The second car it resembles is the Renault Megane &#150 with a bulbous back end reminiscent of ex-royal Sarah Fergusson (to carry through the Scion theme). Maybe not the most complementary of descriptions but then it's better than my first thought, which was - "Oh my, it's a midget with a fat a.ss"

The front is sharply angled, the lamps all sculpted into their surrounds and there&#146s a flair over the rear wheel arch so fat and obvious that you&#146d swear it was designed by Tom Arnold.

It&#146s a well proportioned car, with everything in the right place, some nice symmetry and a look of solidity that belies its size but it lacks the character of the MINI or the cuteness of the Echo hatch. It was neat, it was tidy and I have to say it didn't repel me in the same way that its fat lipped brother the xB did.

Interior

So in I got and... nothing much. I was underwhelmed by the use of dark gray, some darker gray, some almost black gray and the odd smattering of gray. Yup, it was like being stuck back in the early eights in my friend Jim's indestructable Corolla - so much so that I started to look for Cameo cassette I'd dropped on a particularly eventful night in 1991. But to no avail.

There was of course one thing that piqued my interest, the biggest departure from the norm in the xA; the hooded instrument binnacle that sits at the centre of the dash, angled toward the driver. Theoretically it makes sense, though to the virgin it does get quite clitoral (you find yourself looking, in all the wrong places for something hooded only to chance upon it and wonder how you ever missed it). I liked it but then I like the centre speedo in the MINI so maybe it's just me that's weird. Use of black on white and white on black dials are nice if not inspired and the whole display is functional, very clear and easily read - none of those awful Echo digital readouts here thank Jehovah.

Sitting right below that display and very high on the center console is the radio &#150 and it&#146s very nice, especially considering the price of the car &#150 a single slot Pioneer system hooked up to better than expected speakers, it begged to be cranked to 11 (I was told once that the slide to the grave starts the first time you turn a volume control knob left - I didn't this time, there's still hope) The display is simple, intuitive and easy to reach and the propeller style air vents either side serve as an interesting focal point in an otherwise dull cabin.

Everything else is a little bland and budget looking. There&#146s the odd smattering of plastic disguised as metal, lots of plastics that are hard to the touch but not especially brittle in feel and a driving position is a little upright, but not quite as bus like as say the Honda Element.

Performance

The xA is no pocket rocket but it is a surprisingly fine little car. On paper it might be short a few horses (108) and lacking some shove (105lbs torque) all of which come reasonably close to the red line but it actually feels quite sprightly. It picks up nicely and stays reasonable refined right through the range &#150 zipping along at a fair old clip without ever really drawing attention to itself. 

I'll admit that my weekend drive took me nowhere near a test track (or stretch of unpoliced road!) but it handled the freeway, the pock marked tanonic, the hideous lines in route 9 and my off kilter, reverse camber, mile long driveway with aplomb. I can't tell you how it handles at its limits but then let's face it - you're never going to take this car to it's limits now, are you?

The car handles well too &#150 the suspension is firmer than you might be used to but that&#146s to the car&#146s advantage, riding on a stiff suspension and wide, grippy tires might not be a good recipe for a grand tourer but for a car that&#146s going to be nipping in and out of traffic, maneuvering past less agile sheet metal and is generally going to be in the hands of people who want grins as well as a lack of gripes from their cars that's okay. It&#146s all very predictable, all very safe yet it still manages to raise the eyebrows and the corners of your mouth. It&#146s light, zippy and feels bigger than it is &#150 actually it&#146s very European with a feel of a well built Fiat rather than a budget Toyota. For a moment I was back in Cannes at the wheel of a lurid yellow Punto - the Spirito Di Punto filling my soul... only for a moment, a moment broken by the lack of engine howl (a bad thing) and facia rattle (a food thing) associated with Italy's car maker

Equipment

As you&#146d expect from a manufacturer these days the kit list is long and the range of accessories available extensive and expensive. It&#146s going to be hard to resist the options list but if budgets are stretched and you can find an uncustomized car this is pretty much what you get.

Driver and passenger airbags, 5 full seats with belts &#150 the front two of them sports seats, the back three of the split and folding variety, power everything, remote entry, aircon and a really rather good 6 speaker CD.

Dip into the optional extras bin (and your wallet) and you can add everything from revised springs, a performance clutch, a so groovy it should have been standard 7 color illumination switch that turns the cup holders into London&#146s St. Martin&#146s Hotel, offering you ambience at the flick of a switch (okay, okay I&#146m sold more on this than on the car but at night and with a bottle of Evian in there it&#146s the coolest thing), bonkers colored gear knobs (they&#146re sticks not globes), a sub-woofer for that kicking stereo and the usual tricked out exhausts, wheels and decals.

It&#146s a long and costly list of options but it shows that &#147this ain&#146t your grandma&#146s Toyota&#148 whilst pushing up dealer margins and protecting the marque against having to discount so it&#146s a clever gimmick.

Summary

What let&#146s this little car down is that it&#146s just not different enough. It tries to be young, it tries to be funky but deep down it&#146s got your dad&#146s DNA at heart. It&#146s pretty much a middle-aged man in Gucci loafers and Diesel jeans trying to convince the young hotties that he&#146s still got it. It might work for Jack but then Jack&#146s a movie star and this is a suburban runabout. 

It&#146s a solid car, it&#146s a well made car, it&#146s a car that&#146s not at all bad to drive and it has a well thought out cabin. It&#146s at a good price too and it should hold it&#146s values. All good rational reasons to buy &#150 which is what makes it a Toyota. There&#146ll be no arguments over the X-Box as to who gets the Scion and that&#146s the problem &#150 it stimulates the wrong lobe.

I could live with it quite happily, but I shed no tears when it went back. And for a care supposed to gran the youth of America and not let go, failure to grip an old timer such as myself is not a good start.

Sorry Toyota, nice try but I&#146m not convinced.
