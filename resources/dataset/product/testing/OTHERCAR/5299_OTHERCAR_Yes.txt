            Much of my adult life has been spent looking for a reliable, low maintenance and affordable car. I've finally found one in the Honda Accord. Want a car that starts everyday even if it's parked outside in the frozen Chicago winter? This is it!  At under $20,000 this car amazes me. All systems work great. I get nice and toasty warm just a few minutes after starting up on a cold winter morning and I get arctic cold on hot summer days. The car accelerates well and brakes smoothly. And talk about low maintenance, I've done nothing except change the oil for the 2 years I've owned it and everything works fine. Finally a car you can own without having to be an auto mechanic. Now if only my computer worked as well as my Honda!<br><br>
