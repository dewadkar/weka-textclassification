                 My brother came to visit me and my family, and also wanted to visit a car dealership.  This was he's second choice behind Toyota's Rav 4.  For the time I experienced the ride I have to say This vehical is well worth having.  The KIA Sportage is a smooth calm and fun car to be in.  I can tell the enginers of this car spent lots of time on the frame design.  The car runs so smooth somthimes you wonder if it's even on.  The one I rode came with power locks, windows, and CD player.  The sound system is not the best, but it tops a Volvo easily.  The back windows dont come fully down which I dont really care anyways.  One thing that is weird with this car is that the back seats are about six to seven inches taller than the front.  The car is sort in length but does not lack storage space.  On the downside the car is only avalible in a four-cilinder engine so if you want power this is not for you.  The Interior has a solid oak finish around the shifter and CD player, which I think looks very nice.  So if your looking for a quite smooth, compact, reliable Sport Utility Vehical go out and get this Sportage...
