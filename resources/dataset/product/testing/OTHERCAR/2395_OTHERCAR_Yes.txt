             There are good and bad points. Firstly for the price of this camera
 it seems like a great deal. And it probably is. It's got a high
 resolution, manual control, and can record movie files - something
 that most other cameras cannot do. And it's can record longer movie
 files than any other camera in it's price range. I've only had this
 camera for a week. And I was comparing to the Oly c2000z, the Nikon
 CoolPix, and the Kodak dc290. I was originally going to get the
 Kodak, but I found the toshiba on special. They told me at the store
 that I have 30 days satisfaction guaranteed. Does that mean I can
 return it no problem? We'll see. 

  I have decided to return it, and will do so this week. Maybe today
 actually. The problems I've found with it is that it eats up batteries
 big time. Even the Lithuim batteries. For some reason it didn't last
 long than 45 minutes max. It seems kinda short. This is my first 
 digital camera so maybe they are all like this. I don't know. My
 friend has one the sony dsc f55 digital camera. And his seems to work
 pretty well. The batteries get eaten up but from what I gather it
 last longer than what mine had lasted. 
  
  The other point was the macro ability and indoor shots. I found the
 macro ability on the other camera way superior to this one. And all
 my macro shots came out blueish for some reason. With the indoor
 shots you really have to have good lighting. You'll find that looking
 through the LCD screen indoors impossible with the normal setting.
 I've upgraded the firmware to solve this problem but I didn't find
 a large improvement.

  I did find the menu system very very easy to use. And I was up and
 running in no time. 

  I have to say again that my lack of experience with digital cameras
 could be the reasoning behind these problems, but these were my
 impressions. Overall, it's a decent camera but for it's price even
 with the special I thought the quality would be better. I think that
 maybe the technology overall is just not there yet. My other friend
 is going to buy a coolpix soon so I'll be able to compare it's 
 quality, and I might exchange it for the Kodak dc290 that I was 
 originally thinking of - either that or I might dump all the 'features'
 and get a approx 2 million pixel camera that's around $500 US like
 the Nikon 800 or something like that. We'll see. 

  I go on a lot of trips so I think I need a digital camera. It's
 very useful, but I expect to be able to take both indoor shots and
 outdoor shots.
