            My Mom owns a Dodge Intrepid 98 SE, its a great car.  Very luxurious, very fast, very roomy, and very fast (Did I already mention that?).  I &quot;accidently&quot; popped one of the tires one day when driving perhaps a little too fast, and we got a '99 Intrepid when the other was getting fixed.  The '99 intrepid was not SE, and was not nearly as nice as our 98 SE.  Weird.  Take that into consideration if you plan on buying an Intrepid. 

The major problem I have with the Intrepid is that it is a boat.  It takes up a large portion of the lane, the hood is huge and hard to see over, making it quite difficult to meneuver.  It definitely took some time getting used to.

Other then that this is a great car by Dodge/Chrysler, and I would reccomend it to family types.  Lots of room in the back!
