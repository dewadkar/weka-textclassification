            Honda does it again... I always tell people &quot;I am a Honda guy for life&quot;... doesn't matter how much money I make later in life... I will be forever loyal to her.  

Last year, I had to buy a car for my sister, since our '89 civic was a little old for her to drive around... my mom said that she needs to drive in something safer... something with air bags and side-impact protection.  I thought to my self, &quot;What's a good weekend car for me to drive around when she's not using it?&quot;  The Honda Prelude and the Acura Integra came into my mind... 

I ended up choosing the Prelude because it felt more like a touring coupe and because i wanted my sister to drive an automatic while I get to play with the SportShift transmission =) I was really surprised at how while the SportShift transmission responded to my requests... Having mainly driven a stick shift ever since I learned to drive a car, I got used to the control and downshifting to help braking capabilities of a stick shift.  Tho, so many times I wished that gear display digit &quot;4&quot; would allow me to pop it into &quot;5&quot;.  I think the latest Acura CL or TLs have 5-speed SportShift transmissions.  

I love the ride of our Prelude... wonderful for driving long trips down to Southern California.  Honda reliability and quality just shows again in this 1999 Prelude.  

The only complaint i have is that the car is a bit overpriced... for example, it lacks factory leather seating like previous generation of Prelude VTECs which were priced similarly.  But i don't mind spending a bit more to have peace of mind and driving satisfaction...  what do you think?<br><br>
