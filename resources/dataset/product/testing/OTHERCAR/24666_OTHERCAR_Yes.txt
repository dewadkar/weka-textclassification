            <b>A affordable vehicle that full of options</b>
I never been a van fan, I always though that they were transporting large groups or transporting large amount of cargo. I recently rode in a 2000 chevy venture van on a short trip and I surprised with it. It was really comfortable and roomy, and was loaded with all kinds of options. 

The van comes in to different versions, the standard body, which measures about 180&quot; long, and the extended model, which adds about another 14&quot; to the length. I personally rode in the regular (Standard) body style. You have several options on seating too. The first row has two captain chairs and a isle way in the middle. The second row of seat has two different option to choose from, you can choice two captain seats or one complete bench seat. The back is just a bench seat but all of these seat are removable to more storage area.

The van has one sliding door standard, but you can also get sliding doors on both sides if you want. In the model that I rode in had the one sliding door with power assist. This is a nice feature of your hands are full. Just hit a button on the keychain and the door opens up.

They seating in the model I rode in was cloth but you can also get a model in leather, which is what I prefer.

The ride is very comfortable and smooth. There was little in the way of engine noise or wind noise. The vehicle is front wheel drive which will help to navigate through the snow in winter driving. 

The only complaint that I do have is that the engine is a little to small and underpowered for the size of the vehicle. The engine always seems like to was racing under normal driving conditions. The take-off was not all that bad, but I think that it would have benefitted from a 3.8L or 4.3L V6 instead of the standard 3.4 V6.

<b>Overall...</b>
I really liked the van. It offers a lot of options and at a really good price. The engine is little to small for my liking but it will do. I would recommend this van to anyone who needs something bigger then a Blazer/Jimmy but don't want a full size SUV. I wold not recommend this vehicle to people who do any amount of towing or hauling, I would go up to a Astro or Express.<br><br>
