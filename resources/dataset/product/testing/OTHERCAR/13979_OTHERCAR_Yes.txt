            Preface 


This is not my first Honda nor will it be the last. I have owned Civics as well, though the '82 had a lot of recurring problems, it was still a great little car, and it even had enough room for me. Honda has quite a history in this country and along with other Japanese mfrs like Mazda and Datsun, they made it very clear (as they are still doing today with the exception of Ford. . .oops, I mean Mazda) to the American mfrs, that they have to make a better product with better longevity. 

Honda's are fuel efficient, fast, relatively safe, have excellent visibility, and have well designed interiors that are far more ergonomic than many vehicles out there. They are very logically built in regards to the engine, i.e., where everything is placed and how easy it is to get to. Honda has always been a great value for the money paid, depending on how you haggle, due to not only to the resale value, but how well they stay together in the long run. Oh the perfections of the Accord, let me count the ways!


Build Quality


The build quality of these vehicles has always been comparable to other Japanese units like the Maxima and Camry, and has always been, until very recently, supremely superior to cars like the Taurus, Cavalier, etc. The engine bay on the Accord has always been more accessible to me than other cars I have worked on or upgraded, whether for friends or family and whether the vehicle was Japanese, German, or American. This hasn't always been the case on Accords. 

Only since the '90-'93 model year, in my opinion, have they really begun to space out. All of the parts in or on the engine are of a size that doesn't make them look anemic, they are just large enough to instill a good amount of confidence in their respective abilities. The engine parts are easy to get to, allowing me to change my own oil and filter in less than 15 or so minutes. There aren't any massive plastic pieces put over the head or belts in an attempt to make it look &quot;clean&quot;. Though, in some cars, this can make the engine bay quite the looker (VW Passat for example), not having it (to me) simply means you don't have to take it off, potentially loosing screws or brackets.

The door hinges to the trunk and hood hinges are all strong, bolted and welded superbly, and NEVER squeak. The cantilevered hinges on the trunk are an engineering masterpiece, no its not THAT complex, but its execution was perfect. The doors themselves are solid and give a resounding &gt;&gt;thunk!!&lt;&lt; when closed, unlike the rather hollow flimsy sound many doors resonate. They feel heavy but are easily maneuvered and stay where you put them. Again, this may sound like a given feature, but how many times have you parked on a hill, not been totally ready to get out, and have to play the keep-pushing-the-door-open game, sometimes ending in a badly bruised leg or two, not the case on this car. 

The seats, front and back, are firm and mounted well. The front seats have a very positive locking system that leaves no guesswork as to whether you go flying at the stop sign. The rear seat unit is firm, comfy, and supportive. It doesn't shake, squeak or jiggle sideways. The carpet could be better, but I have never (with VERY few exceptions) really seen original carpet that I would call &quot;high quality&quot;. I'm not saying its flimsy or will tear through, but I have always used genuine Honda floormats, sure they're $100, but they are absolutely worth it. They fit well, they have a beautiful metal Accord badge, and they are very thick.

The dash is strong, doesn't squeek or shimmy, even over rougher terrain, and is made of a nice soft vinyl that is textured to a look that is vaguely similar to leather. All the plastic inlays and dash sections are of strong, texture but shiny, plastic. The logos and numbers are easy to read and don't rub off.


Engine

The engine in this car is more than adequate. If I remember correctly the rated horsepower from the factory is about 137 bhp. If this number means nothing to you, let me put in more tangible terms. If you are in a bad situation on the road and need to get out of it quickly, this car will do it. It is fast off the start and will make comfortable highway lane changes at any speed. I have a manual for two reasons.  1) I don't  want a computer making shifting decisions for me.  2) I prefer the versatility of a manual shift vehicle. 

The manual offers me the advantages of better mileage and the ability to adapt my shift patterns to that of what the terrain requires. Speaking of mileage, that is another key feature of this vehicle, great mileage! For the most partI get about 27 mpg, city and hwy miles. My best mileage (on a long trip) was 33! All things considered, I think I'm doing OK on the mileage front.


Clutch and shifting


I will make this as short and sweet as possible, this cars clutch and shifting characteristics are nothing short of thrilling. . .in their simplicity and ease! The tranny just seems to suck the shifter into each new gear, no questions asked. It's just nice to have such a willing shifter at your control, it makes traffic a lot easier to deal with. If you are like me however, its not a chore to shift in traffic, for me its truly second nature and I don't mind. 

The original clutch in my first Civic was replaced at 141,000 miles! I am not saying this is the norm, in fact, its abnormal, but taken as  one of the many, its a good indication of Honda quality. My Accord just turned 100,000 a little while ago and the clutch is as strong today as it was when I bought it! All I am saying is that with my own experience on top of those people i know who have also experienced similar results, its hard for me to question Honda quality.


Comfort


I am 6'5 , 250# (conservative estimates) and I fit in this car beautifully. I have plenty of foot room, my knees aren't mooshed against the dash (as is the case in the Taurus), nor do they bang the center console (Maxima) leaving me bruised and annoyed. The back seat is a reality of my size, if someone my size were driving it would be a hellacious experience, if some, say, 5'6&quot; is driving, it's a different story altogether, but that isn't to suggest I would want to go cross country. The front seats have great support for my lumbars, and as much as I would like them to be, they aren't as great big as seen in some sports cars. The seats themselves are long enough as to not cut into the middle of my hamstrings, and the tilt is great. 

I have excellent visibility all around. The windshield is great big with tha A-pillars perfectly placed. The B-pillars are small enough so as not to create a big blind spot. The C-pillars are the same. I mention these specifically because there are cars out there with gargantuan blindspots induced not from seating position, but from pillar size and location. One has to wonder if the engineer that came up with the designs had ever even SAT in the car, much less driven it. Visibility out the back and sides is also excellent. The interior sound levels in the vehicle are acceptable, I have heard quieter, but simply put, this ain't a Bimmer or a Lexus. Engine noise is controlled well, and with the right tires, its a very mellow ride in there.

The a/c in this car is pretty good, but given the time you WILL hit sub arctic in a big way. Keep in mind though, when I get in my car interior temps are often around 160 F. (it was 111 F last week, welcome to central Texas!). The heat settings are relatively quick and will get as hot as you want it to be. The vents are well placed and are very effective. Thought the back seat will take a little longer to cool down, if you fly the vents up towards the ceiling, you can dramatically cut down on the time involved in getting it to the desired temp.


Fit and Finish


The paint is of visibly high quality. My car is a very dark blue, but the majority of my friends, the dealership, strangers, all think it black. Now keep in mind, I use obnoxiously high end waxes (Klasse) and cleaners (Klasse, Mothers, Blue Coral), own my own buffer, and have a cache of about 200 terry towels. . . . .and yes, I have a 'California Duster', and if used on a daily basis, it can be very effective. I guess my point with all of that was just to say that if you appreciate, clean, wash, and protect your paint it will be as nice as a new Benz when its ten years old, it is all about how much you care! The chrome work, and there's not much, is well placed and looks cast into the spots it surrounds as opposed to looking glued on. The interior fabrics, rubbers, plastics, controls, and misc. fixtures all looks great, but there are a few places where the edges could be better finished. The compartment in the center console is a good example of those rough plastic edges, but the overall quality of the vehicle in general will allow somebody, even as meticulous as I am, to look past these minor nit-picks. 


Summary


The car looks and feels great, I am not sure how much I could describe this without boring you into a deep sleep. This is an excellent vehicle exhibiting great characteristics. I prefer my back end to the 96-97 models, plus clear rear lenses are over $100 less! I think it looks faster and more like what one might see on the BTCC circuit. 

I have heavily customized this vehicle. I wrote this review on the model as it was delivered to me (factory). I will be looking for a more appropriate location to write at least two more reviews on the least expensive/most effective aftermarket parts and conversions. This car has the potential with only a turbo (NO nitrous), ignition, a few small but integral parts, and the proper breathing (pipes, induction, etc.) to produce a comfortable 240 bhp, though it wouldn't be wise to do this without switching out the suspension (which I have), but I'll talk about that later! Thanks for reading!
