            We bought our minivan when we had our fourth child. It was a must for sure! My husband did not want to drive a mini-van, didn't want to let go of his Mustang days :o), but from the first time he drove the minivan he said it wasnt as bad as he thought and it has pretty good pick up. I love the double doors, it makes it so much easier getting all the kids in and out. its a very quiet vehicle and weve had no complaints so far, we absolutely  love it! I would recommend this van to anyone who is looking. It is also very affordable. Plenty of space in the back to fit our double stroller as well, there were many minivans out there we looked at that could not fit it. <br><br>
