            I have been driving a '99 Grand Vitara JLX+ AT (V6 Automatic) for three months.  I am for the most part happy with the vehicle.  It's loaded with options and I only paid $19250, ordering through CarsDirect.com and picking it up at a dealer down the street.

I chose this vehicle because the other small SUVs seemed to be underpowered with 4 cylinders and most did not have as much cargo space.  I looked at the Toyota RAV4, Subaru Forester and Honda CRV.  I also looked at the Isuzu VehiCROSS but decided it was overpriced and strange (very few were made, so it might be difficult to get service and parts).

The Grand Vitara handles well and is easy to maneuver.  Turns in small spaces are a breeze because of the steering range.  It's easy to get in - even though it's higher than a car, you hardly have to step up to get in because its cab is very &quot;tall&quot;.  From a stop, though, it's hard to &quot;win races&quot; when the light turns green.  I expected better acceleration from a V6, but in cases where you really need to get ahead you need to turn on a &quot;Power&quot; switch.

Strong points:

- Nice looking
- Good controls
- Comfortable
- Fairly quiet for an SUV
- Lots of cargo space with back seats down
- Cargo space is very tall - four full-size trash barrels fit fine standing up
- Huge turning range

Weak points:

- Lacks pickup for a V6 - &quot;Power&quot; mode improves this but I assume it reduces fuel economy
- Gas mileage is not very good - about 20-22 mpg avg.
- A/C slow to start on hot days
- Very little cargo space with back seats in use
- Back seat headrests seriously block rear view (I removed them)
- This model is &quot;loaded&quot; - so why isn't the center armrest/storage included? An extra $100-$200 to get it, I bought it for $100 and installed it myself.

Overall, I would recommend this SUV as long as none of the weak points listed are showstoppers for the buyer.
