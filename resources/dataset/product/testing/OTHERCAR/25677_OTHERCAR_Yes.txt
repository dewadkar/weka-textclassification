                 Buick's Roadmaster is GM's response for the buyer who seeks full-sized luxury and comfort. Available in sedan and wagon versions, the rear wheel drive Roadmaster is powered by GM's powerful 260 hp V-8 engine, which also powered GM's Corvette. The engine makes for great acceleration, but poor fuel efficiency, especially around town. 
     The interior is spacious and comfortable. Controls are logically positioned, and the seats provide decent support in both the front and rear. The trunk is enormous, and the wagon should provide enough cargo area for any family, unless the owner decides to use the rear as a seat instead of storage (The rear of the wagon can be used to seat two, meaning 8 passenger capacity, or the seat can be folded down for cargo use).
     Reliability is disappointing on both the sedan and the wagon. Don't be surprised by frequent mechanical difficulties and large repair bills. For a Buick, this model falls far short in maintenance costs. 
     On a positive note, safety in this boat is top notch with tons of steel, anti-lock brakes, and dual airbags.
     For the buyer interested in full-sized luxury and comfort with V-8 power, Buick has delivered. But watch the bill at the gas pump and mechanic.
