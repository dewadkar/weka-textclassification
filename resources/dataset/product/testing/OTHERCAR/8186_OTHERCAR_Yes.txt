            After 11,000 miles of road having passed under my A6 2.7T Quattro, I can honestly say that I'm even more impressed with this car today than I was when I first reviewed it after only 700 miles.

I have recently had my Audi "Chiped" with the Garret Performance and Tiptronic Chip.  For a tad over $1,000.00, I've just increased horsepower and torque well above that of the BMW 540i.  And for about $10,000.00 less than a 540, I've got the best of all worlds.  An all-wheel drive 310 HP rocket with 358 pound feet of torque that offers more bang for buck than I ever really expected.

I recently completed a road trip that took me across 4 western states and through every type of driving condition except a sand storm.  During a blinding rain storm when the road nearly flooded and most drivers were pulled off the road due to the roadway being awash and poor visibility, the A6 with its 4 wheel drive just plowed through the water, never once slipping or loosing an ounce of traction.  When the left tires were in 2-3inches of water, the right tires, (on the higher side) simply pulled the car through without a hitch.

Later, we found ourselves driving hard and fast along desert highways with air temps well over 100 degrees.  The A6 kept its cool and performed flawlessly.  During the entire 2,700 mile trip, the A6 never needed oil.

I can't say enough good things about my A6 2.7T Quattro.  I will simply remind readers that the 2.7 bi-turbo Quattro with the sport package is a completely different experience as compared to the standard 2.8 A6.  

If you really want the real deal and don't want to get into the $55,000.00 plus price range, the A6 2.7 (loaded) is the way to go.
