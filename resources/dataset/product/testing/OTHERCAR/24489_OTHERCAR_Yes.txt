                Everyone knows the saying "You Cant Judge A Book By It's Cover".. and the same is true for the 94 Chrysler Concorde. I am a high-school student and the Concorde is my second car. If you look at this car and think "Granny Car", you are sadly mistaken. With the 3.5L 221hp Engine this car goes like hell, and with the transmission option to have the automatic shift every gear at 6k rpms you have yourself a regular sports car (although this probably isnt good for the engine and i dont recomend doing it for long ;). The suspension is tight, and the car drives much more like a race car then a boat as in other older luxury cars. The 8-way power seats are great for finding a comfortable driving position, although sometimes can be a pain.. leaving you to wish you could just manualy do it yourself and be done with it rather then spending the time of the slow several minute automatic process. The interior is decent looking, and fairly comfortable.. the wood trim on the dashboard is my favorite. I have been told road noise in the car is slightly higher then other cars, but I do not notice it. Essentially, I have no problems with the car and it has been fairly economical and dependable for me as a student. Also, as a sidenote, the trunk is huge.. plenty of room for all kinds of stuff.

 I have read lots of good and bad comments on this car. My only advice would be to find one that was well taken care of. Mine was a one owner car with 88 thousand miles, owned by a man who loved it dearly with oil changes and regular maintence checkups (bought the car in 2001). Take care of this car and it will take care of you. My father's friend has one with 160 thousand miles and counting.

  While it doesnt look like much from the outside, the car is a beast underneath.. so if your willing to sacrifice body style for performance you will be greatly rewarded. I have no doubts mine will last me 5 more years before im out of college and able to buy a new car.
