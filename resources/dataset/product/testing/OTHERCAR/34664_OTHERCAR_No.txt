            An incredible buy!!!!
it was so good, i had to list some features!

Sony introduces a new digital still camera with exceptional image quality and features that only can be found on high-end professional cameras. The DSC-D770 features a high performance Progressive Scan 1.5 million square pixel CCD. This will create still images with high quality resolution (up to 1344 x 1024) which is excellent quality for printing or sending still images from your computer. 

5X Manual Optical Zoom Lens with Manual Focus 
Equivalent to a f28mm to 140mm zoom lens in a 35mm camera, this manual zoom lens gives you ample flexibility to compose your pictures just the way you want. The manual focus ring allows for a more accurate, professional feel. 

High Quality Progressive Scan CCD with 1.5 million Square Pixels
Provides high quality still images by reading all of the pixels on the imager (CCD) with a single pass. This one-time pass over the imager delivers clean edges and an overall sharper picture quality. 

  

Histogram Feature
Represents Luminosity and Color levels in an image. The built-in histogram helps users determine performance results and adjust manual controls accordingly to select the perfect settings. 

  

2.5&quot; Advanced Color LCD with brightness control (180k pixels) 
Use the LCD for playback, or even for your viewfinder while taking shots. Large, full color LCD Display viewfinder lets you preview or review your shots right on the camera back with detail and clarity. 

Removable ATA Type II PC Memory Card or Memory StickTM 
The popular storage media, ATA Type II PC memory card allows you to store still images. The DSC-D770 will also allow you to capture images on a supplied 8MB Memory Stick Digital Storage Media and supplied ATA Type II PC card adapter model MSAC-PC2 

Supplied PC Card Reader 
Allows for easy parallel port connection connection to your PC compatible computer. 

JPEG or TIFF File Formats 
Select between JPEG compression or, for the best images, choose the non-compressed mode to capture your images in a TIFF format. 

Pop-Up Flash and Hot Shoe 
Use to brighten your pictures in low light conditions. You can select from four modes: Automatic, On, Off or use the Hot Shoe to attach an external flash with strobe lights. The automatic mode will turn on in low light and/or adjust for the optimum amount of flash. The Pop Up flash offers the ability to conceal the flash when not in use. 

Center Weighted Spot Meter 
Allows you to control exposure under varied lighting conditions. 

Continuous Shooting Modes 
CONT 1 mode adjusts exposure on each image. CONT 2 maintains the same settings and is faster than CONT 1 mode.
