            I bought this vehicle, due to a family's recommendation, in 1999 and will never regret it! it is a great car for the money! This car is a great family car, for those with children, due to its roomy front and rear areas. I also bought this car due to its great affordability and incentives offered by Chevrolet , on this vehicle.

what i love about this car is the great visibility in all the windows of the vehicle! It is a pleasure to drive and have gotten many compliments from my passengers , while sitting in both front and rear areas, due to the roominess. I also love the way the car handles in all types of weather conditions. I live in Chicago, and with all the snow and rain we get, it got me to work each day, and did not skid on icy areas and had no problem maneuvering over heavily snowed in areas!Look out 4x4's...the malibu is here! Overall, it is a very safe and reliable vehicle for a great price!

what i dislike about this vehicle, is that it is somewhat noisy at times, but generally tolerable. The only servicing done on the vehicle,  has been for a new tire, secondary to a flat. Also, the music system has much to be desired, so, if you are a music lover, you should purchase your own system from an outside source.

This car, in summary, is a very safe and reliable car for the money and is very easy to maneuver, if you live in areas requiring this, such as the midwest.  It is safe for children, with ample room in back for car seats. It is recommended for  young and old alike, due to its performance and reliability and great price!<br><br>
