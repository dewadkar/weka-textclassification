            I purchased this vehicle after acquiring a job 110 miles round-trip from my home.  I hoped for reliability, durability, great mileage, and reasonable insurance rates.
Well, the car has exceeded all my expectations.  I get close to 40MPG (5-speed).  I purchased the car in March of 1999.  It currently (12/06/2000) has 55,000 miles on it.  I change the oil the recommended 6,000 miles.  I have had no problems with the car since driving it off the dealers lot a year and a half ago.  I have always owned Subaru's but left that maker due to the high price and poor gas mileage.  After seeing the reliability from this Nissan, I will most likely never go back.  No granted, interstate miles are easy on a car, so I guess only time will tell.  Only complaint, the air conditioner compressor seems a little noisy during the summer, but hardly noticeable.  But, I am very satisfied with this car and have no second thoughts about the 'others' I contemplated during my search for a new car.  I can't say enough........
(11/16/2001)  I now have 89,000 miles on the car.  I continue to change the oil every 6,000 miles.  A few weeks ago the drivers side sun visor broke, in that it wouldn't stay up.  After three calls to the dealer, a wrong part, and the dealer calling Nissan, the sunvisor is supposed to be on its way, 3 weeks.  Must be coming from Japan!  This is the 'only' problem I have had with the car so far.  Still love it!
