            I loved this car - I got it at an auction in Napa in 1996 and it served me  well for just over two years before the things I liked about it did me in on rainy afternoon on my way home on 280N during El Nino (hydroplaned for a spin and a half and then flipped over).

This little car was perfect for a city dweller -- it's small, parks easily.  I could get the most AMAZING amount of stuff in to the back of this car when the seats were folded down.

This little car is great for cyclists -- I could put TWO mountain bikes in the back when the seat was folded down (take the front tires off).

This car has low roof clearance but I never had to open the moon roof to get more space (I'm 5'10&quot;).  My 6'6&quot; father drove this car comfortably and put 230 miles on it before handing it over to me -- his knees were pretty close to the dashboard, but he had no complaints.  My boyfriend, at 6'2&quot;, was able to fit in this car pretty comfortably -- there is more head clearance than in his 1995 Lexus coupe (if he sits up too straight in that car, his head touches the ceiling).

Another thing about this car is that it handles really well -- riding up to visit my dad in the mountains above Napa along Monticello Rd/128 was pure FUN in this car.  It could take tight turns and zip right up that hill like nobody's business (unless there was an SUV driving tourist toting a boat on a trailer refusing to acknowledge the &quot;slow traffic use turnouts&quot; signs).

I do not, however, recommend trying to drive this car if with a broken right collarbone (ouch!).  

One of the problems I experienced with this car were that it seemed prone to parking lot vandalism -- everyone seemed to want to kick it, ding it with their doors or back into it.  This is the only car I ever had that picked up a scratch or ding on a weekly basis.  

The other problem was that this car tended to fishtail quite a bit -- the tail end is pretty light, and even with good tires, you're going to find that gravel or slick pavement cause problems.  If you live in a cold climate, just throw a couple 50# bags of sand in the back (it'll come in handy if you get stuck in ice or snow).

I loved this little car and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, easy to handle used sports car.
