            The Passport is a great value inside and out.  It has power (200hp), style and grace.  Although designed primarily by Isuzu, you'll find that Honda has made their own refinements on the rough edges left by the Rodeo.

If you consider the EX-L (Luxury Edition), you'll find that it is comparable, perhaps even surpassing cars _above_ it's class; including the Nissan Pathfinder, Toyota 4Runner, Chevy Blazer and Ford Explorer.

The interior is surprisingly spacious with controls well laid out in the best of Honda traditions.  With a 200hp V6, it is quite peppy on the street and has great passing power for the highways (compare to the Xterras, Explorers, 4Runners, etc. in the same price range yet with much less power).

The ride is smooth and quiet (although unnecessarily bouncy at times), it sways a bit when turning, and the gas mileage is, well, awful (if you want better gas mileage, check out the Chevy Tracker).  The stock stereo system isn't so hot, even with the 6 disc changer.  And one thing that surprises me with the EX and EX-L is that the side windows come tinted, but the rear window doesn't!

Alas, at the end of the day, it is still a re-badged Isuzu Rodeo.. but since first entering the Honda line in 1991, the Passport/Rodeo has undergone many refinements dictated by the Honda ergonomics and motor engineers.

I actually didn't end up buying this car but opted for the Pathfinder instead (more refined, more horsepower).  However, budget-minded buyers looking for a loaded SUV absolutely MUST check out the Passport EX-L (and, hey, the LX isn't so shabby either!).<br><br>
