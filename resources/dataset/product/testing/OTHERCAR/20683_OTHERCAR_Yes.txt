            I've owned my 1998 S70 T5 since mid-1997 and have put 90000 miles on it, most of that at 75mph on the freeway. (Once a week I drive a 400mi round trip, almost always done in the same day...sometimes I spend more time in the car than at the destination!)

I've driven all three models of S70 (base, GLT, and T5) while my car gets serviced, and the differences among the models go well beyond the engine performance.

The suspension and steering on the T5 are much more solid and heavy than the base and GLT models. On the non-T5 models, the steering is light---so different, that last week I almost hit a curb on the first right turn! Except in tight parking situations, I find the heavier steering feel is safer and more comfortable in high-speed driving, requiring less attention to keep in the lane. Handling is much more stable on the T5 than the base model, with less roll in turns, better overall traction, and less body motion during braking.

Even the exhaust tone of the T5 is better: on the base and GLT models it sounds like a low-end Toyota. That annoying low-mid &quot;hum&quot; of the exhaust is just not there on the T5.

Others have lauded the solid, comfortable ride, the lack of rattles, and the greatest seats. (My six-hour round=trip drive doesn't take its toll with those seats.) I won't go into further details other than to add my voice to those plaudits.

Try all the models and decide which feels best to you.<br><br>
