            I have owned only two VW products during my tenure of driving over the last decade. The first was a lemon coloured red GTI (see my opinion '95 VW Golf GTI), needless to say, my experience with VW products was, well, tainted to say the least. 
After being screwed over by the dealership, I dragged my broken ego and this 4 door family car down the highway, praying that it would make it home...
Nearly two years later, my opinion of the Volkswagen product is essentially, pending...
Through our varying seasons the car has yet to fail me, even when I left it unplugged in the crispness of -25 degrees celsius (that's about -10 farenheit, for our american neighbours). To be honest that little test occurred over about a week, still the car started, albeit, sounding like it was running on two cylinders. Of the fad of seeing-if-that-little-bugger-will-start soon ended, and the block heater was again employed for it's task.
Since the vary first time I test drove the car, I felt (and still do) there MUST be something wrong with the 4 speed automatic, it will pull at an intersection like crazy. I believe there is about 300rpm difference between the tranny engaged and in the drive position. It is a very sluggish shifter, particularly with the 3rd to 4th gear up and dowshifts. The biggest complaint I have with the transmission is the, seemingly low gearing. At 120km/h (~75mph) the engine will read 3600rpm on the tach, the 92hp, 1.8ltr engine spins out at redline at 4200. That doesn't leave much room on the highways and freeways for passing. A recent trip to the west coast of Canada found our little cruising car getting dusted by Pontiac Firefly(s) left, right, and center.
Fuel economy is reflected by the high engine speeds. I have found the average to be about 18-20mpg in town and 25-27 mpg on the highway, however, this highway mileage didn't really deviate when the car was cruising the plains or chugging through the mountains. 
The exception of air conditioning makes it a bit of a cooker in the summer, but this car truely does shine in the winter. The winter dependability, mentioned above, and a heater core the size of a Mac truck this thing PUMPS the heat into the cabin. Winter driving in this car is also a pleasure, nearly impossible to make it track anything but straight (I've tried) and incredibly stable. This car would be my suggestion for any unproven driver or new driver...
I am a 'base' car kind of guy, all the power options are really just things to fix in the future. Volkswagon designers have really hit the nail on the head with the interior and basic features of the car. The analog speedo and tach are nice, clear and easy to see. The power doors and trunk are a frill that makes life soo much easier, as well as the central locking system which makes locking your keys in the car nearly impossible. The supposed 'premium sound system' is far from that, however the wiring diagram is included on the hardware so it makes aftermarket installs much easier (no more testing with fuses...)    
One final thing that is so minute, yet such a big deal to me. VW has used fine thread screws in the cabin. What's the big deal? Nothing today, tommorrow or even next year, it's about five years down a bumpy road those fine screws will be holding everything tight, secure and QUIET...
Ahhhh! the sounds of silence...
