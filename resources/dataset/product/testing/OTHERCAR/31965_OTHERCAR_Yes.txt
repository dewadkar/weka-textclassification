            My partner and I wanted a bigger car, specifically a SUV.  We had looked around at other SUV, and the Honda Passport seemed to be a better deal than the rest. We have had our Black Honda Passport for approximately 1 month and we absolutely love it! We enjoy the smooth ride and the mutlitude of features that it came equipped with.  For example, the sun/moon roof, tinted windows, wood grain interior, just to mention a few.  It is roomy inside which offers plenty of leg room and seats that fold down to make it possible to sleep and go camping in.  We suggest that anybody who is considering buying a SUV, to get the Honda Passport. It is very user friendly. :-)<br><br>
