            Polaroid invented instant Photography.  Digital Cameras, redefined it.

The lure of digital cameras is strong.  After all the good ones include high resolution CCD's, an LCD screen for instant review and deletion, and High quality snapshots.  Not to mention, they don't use any film!!! How good is that?

They also have a high price tag.  Until the Digimax 130, that is.  I had been shopping for a digital camera for some time now, and noticed a HUGE price gap between the "toys" and the "real" cameras.  The "toys" were available at less than $100, had a VERY low maximum resolution (usually 640*480 max), came in cheap blister packs, and had no LCD preview feature.  What is the purpose of a digital camera, if you have to wait until you get to your computer to see if the print is usable or not?  

The "real" cameras listed for $200 or more.  

The Digimax is the perfect "family" digital camera.  It offers 8Meg of onboard RAM, has a 1.3 Megapixel CCD to handle 1280*960 resolution prints.  Has 2x "digital" (ugh) zoom, and a auto flash and self timer function.  It takes pretty good pictures, and will last a pretty long time on a set of NiMh batteries.  (NiMh batteries should be considered MANDATORY for any digital camera...)

The Digimax is not for EVERYONE,  Some people who make lots of prints or large prints will opt for a bigger camera.  Also, a zoom lens would be nice.

However, at $128, the Digimax actually delivers a useful camera that delivers, near the price of the other "toys".

Oh, and do some research.  Digital cameras are definitely a "you get what you pay for deal".  The REAL cheap ones are usually not worth the plastic they're wrapped in.  

The Digimax is an entry level camera that can actually be considered a Camera.  If you go any lower, you might as well buy your camera at Toys'R US.
