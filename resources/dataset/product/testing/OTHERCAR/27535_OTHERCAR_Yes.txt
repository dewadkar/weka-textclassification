            My husband and I bought our Jeep because we wanted something versatile.  It can be used for both work and play.  I think it handles very similar to my car, with little road noise which is very important to me.  The ride is very smooth and handles curves with ease. I love the fact I can put it into 4wheel drive whenever the weather conditions call for it-snow is no problem now!  My Jeep has an in line 6 cylinder engine which has plenty of power for both my husband and I. 

Of the many features the Jeep has to offer, my favorite is the above head console.  This features a digital display of the outside temperature with an ice warning when it gets below 32*.  It also tells you in which direction you are heading, current gas mileage, over all gas mileage, how many miles you have left on the current tank of gas and how long you have been driving since your last fill up.  I find the Jeep is somewhat of a gas hog as compared to my car.  On average, I get about 19 miles per gallon on the highway and about 15-17 miles per gallon in the city.  

Another thing I like about my Jeep is it sits high off the ground.  I spend a lot of time on the road and want something I can feel safe in.  I can actually see when I drive and don't feel invisible to the truckers on the road when I travel.

I am very satisfies with my Jeep and would recommend one to anyone.<br><br>
