            I decided to lease my wife a new car for an anniversary present this year. In my typical over-research way, I set out to find the perfect sports-sedan for our family. I already have a 4-Runner, so extensive room is not a requirement. in fact, I was looking for something smaller that's easier to park and drive than the Maxima that it would be replacing.

I went to the Web and various magazines to find the best in the $28-$34,000 range. Acura had the best advertised lease rates, so I thought the other dealers should be pretty competitive in this price range. Lesson #1: Lease prices are VERY subsidized by some car makers. Acura, Audi, Volvo and even Lexus to some degree were offering amazing lease deals on their cars. It's very hard for non- subsidized cars, like Infiniti, to compete.

After driving the Volvo S60, Acura TL-S, Audi A4, Infiniti G35, VW Passat, and Lexus IS300, we narrowed it down to the A4 and the G35. We also sat in the BMW 325, but were so turned off my the lack of room in the back, we didn't even bother driving it. Storage in the 3-series BMW is very poor as well, the console is just there for looks.

Our first impression of the G35 was good. Our biggest turn off for the other cars was the wood trim intierior. Sorry folks, but wood belongs in a Cadilac or Rolls Royce. I don't care what Jaguar or Lexus thinks, there is nothing sporty about it. The G35 took a total 360 degree approach to this "status quo" and replaced all of the wood with brushed aluminum. Very slick and classy in it's own right. The sports suspension also adds a piece of brushed aluminum over the entire console. Very nicely done!

Beyond interior style, the comfort in top notch. The seats in particular do an excellent job of holding you in. Unlike BMW's sport seats (which are excellent) Infiniti's seats don't have that overly-aggressive wrap-around like appearance. At first glance, you wouldn't think that they would hold you in, but they do. They're also much easier to get in and out of than the BMW's.

The back seat room is surprisingly large. By far, the roomiest and easiest to get in and out of. BMW's back seats were a joke, and volvo and Audi's were not much better. We understand that this is a mid-side sports car and not a limo, but still, you would expect ample entry/exit room. The G35 beats all others in this class for back-seat room. 

The real plus on this car is the performance. This car absolutely rocks! I also race motorcycles, so my thrill level for performance is pretty high. This car exceeds that level and then some. The power delivery is nicely balance so that your normal around-down acceleration is controlled and smooth, while allowing you to accelerate in a turbo-like fashion (without the lag) with only a slight push of the accelerator. Being that our car is still new, I haven't come close to pushing it's limits, and I'm almost scared to try it. It's VERY fast. 

With any performance car, speed is useless without the right handling and braking. Again, both of these far exceeded my expectations. With the sports-suspension, this car didn't lean one inch around corners. Even my wife, who is a very conservative driver, found herself taking them faster and faster. The car gives such a planted, level feel when cornering without the discomfort of a Corvette. The brakes also bring it all to a stop at will. I think this car has the shortest braking distance of the bunch, which was noticeable on the first stop. Just make sure no one is on your tail when you try them out, for you will get rear-ended! 

Trunk room is fairly good for a car of this class. The biggest feature missing is fold-down rear seats which should be mandatory. The rear armrest has an access panel for long items, which helps. 

My biggest peeve is the optional Boise stereo. The standard unit is rated at 120 watts, the Bose at 200 plus a Sub woofer. The sound is OK, but not worth the $900 price tag. I knew this from the start, but all of the G35's we saw had the Bose stereo, so we were forced to get it. Not only is the price high, but there are no controls for the subwoofer. If you get to a song that has a lot of bass, it starts sounding like some kid in a Civic cruising the boulevard. The only way to turn down the thumping of the subwoofer is to turn down the bass, which makes the rest of the speakers sound weak. What's the point? and more importantly, I'm paying $900 extra for this!!! the unit also has pre-set volume controls which are a pain. It always seems to be either too loud or too quiet. Our Maxima had the same problem, so I guess it's a Nissan thing. 

Another problem is the auto A/C unit. The concept is great, but the car sends the unit at full blast until the temperature is reached. Ok on paper, but the unit is so loud you can't even have a conversation. Very embarrassing when you have people in the car.

UPDATE: We've had the car now for 4,500 miles. It's even more fun to drive then when we got it; takes a while to get comfortable.
ADDITIONAL PROS: You can not spin the car at all! I've taken it at hard turns in the rain, and the traction control works flawlessly. This may be true with most high-end cars now-a-days, but it's my first experience with one in the rain. The rear-wheel drive system means nothing - it handles rain as good if not better than our former front-wheel drive Maxima.

POWER: this car still rocks. The only downside is my wife does not me drive it the way i want to (with her in it)

HEADLIGHTS: Offer a nice, wide viewing angle, especially considering we don't have the Xeon headlights.

NOW THE CONS: The car still handles a little rough on slow, poor pavement roads (which are common in NJ) I wish we could have got the sport-suspension wheels instead of the sports-suspension.

RADIO: Still stinks (for the money) radio reception is worse tahn my 4-runner's standard unit. I think the windshield antenna is a bad design.

WILLOW INTERIOR: The floor mats are a very light grey. What were they thinking??!!??

CRUSE CONTROLL: switches need to be backlit on the steering wheel. Hard to find in the dark.

POWER SEAT CONTROLS: They're located on the top of the seat, right next to the drink holder. One splash and it's by-by power seats. They also collect a lot of dust. Again, what were they thinking??!??

SILVER INTERIOR TRIM: It looks cool, but it scratches VERY easily. It really should be a metal, not painted plastic. The car is just leased, so we don't care that much, but still . . .

I still love to drive this thing, which is what it's all about. I guess when you look at the rest of the $30,000 market, the flaws are not that bad. I think it's easier to be picky with this car because of the Infiniti hype. A Chevy Suburban costs well over 30 grand, but you wouldn't care if the interior plastic gets a rub on it.
