            I bought this camera to replace my film camera and am very pleased so far.  It is my first digital camera and i am on a low budget so i was looking for something entry level but still good quality.  I realized that i rarely used my zoom on my old camera and when i did the pictures where dim because i did not have a zooming flash.  For that reason, i decided i did not need to spend extra money on something with a huge optical zoom, and when i went to buy the camera in the store i played with a 2x optical zoom and didn't think it was worth an extra 50 dollars.  So far, i have only taken pictures around my house and found the highest quality to be amazing and the vga quality pictures to be very good quality.  I think the included rechargable batteries have a good life, but i am also very pleased that the camera can use standard AA batteries, so when i go on short trips i can just bring a few extra sets of AA batteries and not worry about bringing the charger (this is especially good for out of country trips -- no adaptor is required for the charger if you use regular batteries).  I love the size of this camera, as i went outside with it in my pocket and it was not bulky or heavy, so much so that i almost forgot it was there.  The movie mode is decent quality but uses a lot of memory and needs lots of light as there is no flash when shooting movies.  I was used to a camcorder with a light and tried to take video in a dark area and it didn't turn out well.  Overall i really like this camera, and as with any other camera i would highly recommend buying extra memory (i bought an extra 128mb memory stick).  You can check out my webshots album at http://community.webshots.com/user/drumbeat10 to see pictures i have taken with this camera.  I believe all the pictures in this album when i am writing this review are at VGA (lowest) quality except the one of my cat.  If you click on the thumbnails and look underneath them you can see that actual image resolution and also view the images full size.  This way you can get a better idea of what the megapixels and resolutions mean.  Good luck with your shopping!
