            We bought a Grand Voyager SE from a local car rental agency - only 37,000 miles on it, only 8 months old, and in very good condition.

There's plenty of storage space and options. Take the middle or back seat out, or just move the back seat forward, or fold it forward, or fold both forward, or..... It's nuts! Cup holders. It's a seven person van, but there's 8 cup holders! Plenty of leg room in just about all the seats, even for grown ups. The tinting on the windows is nice - keeps the car a lot cooler than it would be without it. The back windows being remote controlled is a nice touch, and it's nice to leave them open to help cool the car off.

The suspension gives a nice ride, and the engines got quite a bit of pickup. Highway/city/rural driving is a breeze, and it's got a big gas tank and gets pretty decent mileage (especially important with gas prices on the rise....).

Overall, I'd say it's a great buy.<br><br>
