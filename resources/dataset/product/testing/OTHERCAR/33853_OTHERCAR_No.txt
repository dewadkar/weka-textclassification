            After being run into for the third time in six months this past December, my car was finally declared totaled.  It was a mixed blessing.  I felt like my 92 Chevy Corsica had a bulls-eye on it and it was beginning to look like a serious piece of crap, but it was paid for and it had never given me a bit of trouble mechanically.

Even though I didn't really like the idea of driving the stereotypical <i>mom mobile</i>, I knew a mini-van would be good for our family.  Our two children are now old enough that we can begin to do a bit of traveling by car and I thought a mini-van would be the ideal vehicle for car trips.  Also, I hated always having to pay to have every last purchase hauled.  I knew we could eliminate some of that expense with a mini-van.

So I began my search on the web.  Saftey was important to me and very much on my mind because of the three aforementioned collisions, the first of which landed me in the hospital with a broken sternum.  The Villager did as well as most mini-vans, which is to say, average but not particularly outstanding.  I'm really surprised that mini-vans aren't safer than they are considering they are typically a family vehicle.

I also wanted something that had a more sleek and sporty look than the average <i>boxy</i> mini-van and I wanted it to be good sized, but not huge.  The 1998 Mercury Villager GS fit the bill perfectly.  I looked up a local Mercury dealer on the web to price them, and lo and behold, they were in my price range! 

The dealership was pleasant enough to deal with.  I went by myself, somewhat leery of how I might be treated as a woman, but the salesman was actually very decent.  When I test drove the van, I jokingly asked, "Where are the cup holders? I can't buy a vehicle without cup holders!" and he spent the rest of the time pointing out the ample cup holders throughout the van which was rather annoying.  They tried to overcharge me $2000 on the vehicle, but I did my homework before I went in and was able to get it at the price I wanted (after about 20 minutes of pointless negotiations - do they enjoy that song and dance???).

My first mistake was test driving this vehicle during dry weather.  It handled like a charm.  I purchased the van in January, during our <i>January Thaw</i>, the two weeks of January in Iowa that are actually somewhat decent weather wise.  We had a very harsh, cold winter with lots of snow and ice and I soon learned that the Villager does not do well on anything but dry road surfaces.

It is front wheel drive, but the V6, 3.1 Liter engine doesn't seem powerful enough to really pull a vehicle this size through even a couple of inches of snow and it gets stuck easily.  My Corsica was a mid-sized vehicle with a 3.2 Liter engine and front wheel drive and it was an absolute snow plow.  I literally could get through anything in that vehicle and only got stuck once in the seven years I owned it (and that was from doing something stupid).  The Villager also slides easily and I don't know enough about vehicles or physics, for that matter, to explain why.  I have not had to purchase snow tires specifically for my other front wheel drive vehicles, but I may have to consider it this fall.  Winter was hell in this vehicle although I did begin to attain some sort of a comfort level with the way it handled on snow and ice by the time the season ended.

Spring in Iowa is very windy and wet.  As with most vans and primarily because of the body design, windy days are bad days in a van.  Especially when the road surface is wet.  Again, I did not feel in complete control of the vehicle and was blown all over the road on those classic kite flying days.

Well, now we're into summer and I'm not having any problems handling this beast of a van.  Driving has become a much more pleasant experience now that the climate has calmed.  The Villager is actually only a little longer than a car and handles much like one.  The ride is smooth, the engine purrs, and I'm queen of the road, riding high in my tamed beauty.

It really is a nice looking vehicle and I  liked the color scheme when I purchased it.  The exterior is a dark blue-green with silver trim and the interior is a light, velvety gray.  Now I'm personally a red or black vehicle kinda woman, but they don't seem to make mini-vans in those colors.  The color is nice when freshly washed, but unfortunately, it only stays clean for a day tops.  Thanks to my children and my affection for drinking coffee in the car, the light gray interior isn't as charming as it was when I purchased the vehicle.  Charcoal gray may have been the better choice for our family.

The Villager has seven passenger seating and lots of room.  There are three rows of seats; the first two rows are four pilot seats (two in each row) and the third row is a bench seat that holds three passengers comfortably. Leg room abounds and I can fit my 5'9" frame (173 cm) in any of the seats and feel comfortable.  The seats are comfortable even on prolonged car trips and can be adjusted to a variety of positions including laying down flat if you wanted to sleep.  I joked about the cup holders, but there really are some by each group of seats which is nice for travel and garage sale-ing on hot summer days.  

The rear windows are tinted to the point where you can see out, but you can't see into the van which is nice for privacy and gives my auburn-haired, fair-skinned children a little sun protection.  The rear windows crack open - I don't know what the correct term is - they can be pushed outward on a hinge which is a nice feature because there is no rear air conditioning.  

There are two sets of dome lights which can be set to turn on when the doors open or the key is removed from the ignition, to not come on at all, or to remain on at all times.  It's nice to be able to turn on the rear-most light for my nine year-old to read by and it doesn't disturb my view out in the least.  Also, after you remove the key from the ignition, the lights dim but stay on long enough for you to get your things and exit the vehicle.  Everyone is probably thinking, "Yeah, big deal!", but this is the fanciest vehicle I have ever had.

One of the features I like best on my van is that you don't actually need to remove the back seat for additional cargo space.  It folds up and slides forward all the way up to the second row of seats.  The seats can be removed if you choose, but this is so much more convenient and simple and has served my needs up to now.  Also, all of the seats fold down flat so I have hauled a bed in it without removing the seats.  I just slid the bed in over the top of the folded seats.  And while on the subject of folding the seats, the seats convert into tables!  When folded, they have a hard plastic surface and cup holders that can be used to eat on.

This really is a neat vehicle in a lot of ways, but had I known how badly it would handle in inclement weather, I would not have purchased it. I live in the mid-west, we only have about four or five "good" months a year!  But now it's lovely, sunny, and warm and I have two weeks of vacation coming in July.  Time to explore America The Beautiful by van!
