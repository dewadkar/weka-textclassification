            This SUV may look like an over kill but it is not.  This SUV is very comfortable and has a great ride.  The gas mileage is good as well. The Suburban also has good handling for its size. This is also a great family car.  It belts 6 with shoulder belts and 2 more with just lap belts.  There are four member of my family 2 adults and 2 kids.  The Adults can site in the front and the 2 kids can each have their own row.  This is a nice feature because when you are sitting in the front you don�t hear �get out of my space.� �Stop breathing my air.�  And other very annoying things like that.  This car also has a very good look.  The teenager in the family likes how it is �tuff� looking car.    Another nice feature about the space is for carrying.  When all there rows are in and up right you still have about 3 and a half feet of storage for groceries, back packs, Etc.  You can completely remove the last row of seats and you then have lots of room or if you need even more you can even lay down the middle row.  All and all this car has tons of room.  The Suburban is also a very safe car with front air backs.  As I mentioned before you can fit 6 with shoulder belts which I think is important.  When you look at the plans for the Suburban it literally is built in a �cage�.  The �cage� offers a nice security feature for if you either off road, get into a wreck or what ever may happen if you car turn upside down it will add a little more protection.  I would recommend this car to any body. I would defiantly look at this car if you have a family or about to have a family.<br><br>
