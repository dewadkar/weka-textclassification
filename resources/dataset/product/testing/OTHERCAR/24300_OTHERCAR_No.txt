            I recently (4 weeks ago) bought a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo with 69k miles. Everything was just peachy until a few days ago, when basically I realized it for the piece of crap it is.
#1: The car wouldn't start, had to have it towed.
#2: Mechanic figures out there are 3 things wrong; The exhaust has a crack in it, the "relays" needed to be replaced and the battery was dead. 
$1500 later, I call to see if I could pick up my car, guess what! More problems.
#3: The radiator sprung a leak and needed to be replaced, and the engine now overheats when they were testing the new exhaust. Wooopdy freakin do. 
Hopefully, I hope someone like me is reading this. About 1 month ago I turned to this website for guidance on which car I wanted to get. I read LOTS of reviews from magazines that gave the GC good awards and kudos. But realize, they are only around the car for the few days that they test it, so there would be no reliability issues that would come up. Trust me, DO NOT BUY JEEP. I should never bought an American car, should have bought European but that's my mistake. Don't make the same mistake I did. DO NOT BUY JEEP.
