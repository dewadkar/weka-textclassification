            When I was sixteen, I inherited my brother's black 89' Chevy Cavalier.  When I started college, I bought a used red 93' Chevy Cavalier.  When I went shopping this past month for a brand new car I went to five different car dealerships, viewed and test drove about 7 different cars (Corrola, Camry,Altima, Malibu, etc.)  I didn't like any of them; They didn't seem to fit my personality or my driving style.  Until I test drove the New 2000 Chevy Cavalier.  I feel in love with it again.  It looks like a sporty, racy car- It drives beautifully- it has tons of leg room (I'm a 5'11&quot; foot woman with long legs.)  The best part is it already felt like my car.  Perhaps it is because I already knew that Cavaliers are trustworthy, reliable cars.  Perhaps it is because I already knew where all the buttons and switches were from my previous cars.  I am not sure as to why I felt so comfortable with this big hunk of metal- but I knew that this was my first new car and I didn't want to buy something that I wasn't completely in love with.  Then the salesman told me the great leasing price and I signed on the dotted line- even though I was &quot;just shopping.&quot;  I guess you could say I personify owner loyalty.  It is quite easy to be loyal to a car the has always been loyal to me. <br><br>
