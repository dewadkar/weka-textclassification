            Let me get right to point, at first the car that I was looking for was a cheap, small car for me and my wife to basically just get to work. Good on gas, decent room and the easier to drive the better. Enter the OZ Lancer. I'll admit it, I HATED this car in 2003 trim. The interior? Blah. Oh and that grill. But seeing the rebates in the paper for the ES trim 2004 Lancer, at around $11,000, I decided the new look Lancer was worth, well, a look. I have owned the car for two weeks now, the OZ, not the ES and I really just like this car. The interior? Still not it's greatest asset in terms of looks but I have to admit it has grown on me. Maybe it's the fake carbon fiber trim ( instead of gloss black or wood trim) on the dash but it isn't all that bad. The exterior ( ours is black ) may not be confused for a Ferrari but I like it, and so do the people I know. When I drive this car it just FEELS good. Good, linear power, supportive seats and a leather shift knob makes this car feel sporty.
     Now I have to admit that I do have a few small gripes about this car. The shifter feels "clunky" and could be smoother. The "OZ" 15 inchers look small on this car and really don't blend as well with the car as the rims found on the Ralliart version or even the EVO. Engine noise can be a small problem if the car is taken for a ride above 4 grand (4000 RPM). Lastly, is the suspension. I love it on the streets, especially freeways, but hate it driving over speed bumps. But overall it is solid. Just depends on your taste.
    In conclusion, I really just wanted to write this opinion to give anyone looking for a new car a point of view. My wife and I just went driving around test driving. A pain, you can imagine, because of salespersons. In the end after driving a Civic EX, Mazda 3, KIA Spectra and a Nissan Sentra the Lancer OZ was just FUN. A spoiler and rims! We paid just over 15 for it. And the dealership was great. At least give the Lancer a try and have fun doing it.
