            As you may know from my other reviews, I usually buy paralyzingly expensive digital cameras.  The bulky, chunky SLR-style camera was made just for me.  But sometimes the neck aches from too much camera.  When my D30 was stolen, I decided to try the other end of the scale.  

<b>The beauty of the camera</b>

I suppose one should buy a camera to take beautiful pictures, but it's also possible to be enthralled by a beautiful camera. The S200 is gem-like in its miniaturized perfection, its shiny stainless steel body reeking of quality.  And after a month or so of ownership, the camera continues this sense of slick perfection.  Despite having shared my pocket with keys and a heavy cellphone, it continues to shine, seemingly unblemished by its experiences.

One reason I bought it is that I was thinking of traveling to strange lands, where a SLR-type digital camera might just be too expensive to risk.  But I also wanted something that would be a bit of a conversation piece.  Although I have yet to do my contemplated travel, I believe that if this is your mission, this camera will satisfy.  It's impressed people every bit as much as my almost ten times as expensive digital SLR did.

<b>Carry it anywhere ... even to work</b>

This camera fits in pretty much any kind of pocket.  You can literally drag it along with you anywhere, popping it out when needed.  There are plenty of pictures I've taken that I simply would not have taken with my SLR-style digital camera, because it was there, and my SLR-style camera wasn't.

<b>The Battery</b>

For some reason, I haven't had the battery life woes many others have.  This is probably because this is not the type of camera which just cries out for you to take hundreds of carefully-composed photographs, as a SLR does.  Instead, one will do, and it won't come out quite as you want, but it will probably be Good Enough.

I will note, though, that I like the battery.  It's a rectangular object that's about the size of what a single AA cell would be if it was squashed into a rectangle.  I bought a spare, and it lives in my wallet, fully charged, at all times.  This would be a lot harder to do with AA cells or AA-style rechargables.

<b>So what's picturetaking like?</b>

Well, Howard Creech was quite right in his review: This camera is not for the creative photographer.  It does not show the fine detail that more expensive cameras do.  And it's easily fooled if you bring it into difficult focusing scenerios, like a narrow tree branch in front of a background.  The background's more likely to be in focus than the branch.

On the other hand, I probably shouldn't judge it that harshly.  It is not a $3,000 digital SLR; I'm trying to use it like one and, naturally, it doesn't quite work out.

But it seems nicely optimized for pictures of people.  Most of the portraits I've taken have come out quite well.

<b>The flash that flashed too much</b>

A common complaint about this kind of camera is that it's difficult to deactivate the flash.  I have taken many pictures with flash that I really meant to not have any at all.  What apparently happens is that the flash settings are automatically reset whenever you turn on the camera.  So if you turn it on, deactivate the flash, and then it goes off during a period of activity, your turning it back on re-activates the flash.  Oops.

A slight compensation is that the flash may not make a lot of difference anyway.  Unless you're taking a really close portrait, don't count on the flash to illuminate your subject.  The most common situation I saw is that it would illuminate the left front of the subject while leaving the rear back dark.

A major plus is that the control to reset the flash is clearly marked and easy to find.  But it's way too easy to forget to use it.

<b>Low Light means you're out of luck</b>

I would almost tell you not to bother even trying to take pictures with low light.  The camera's light sensitivity is not good, and when you force it, it will take horribly grainy shots.  They're better than nothing, but only marginally.

<b>It's hard not to be in love with a beauty</b>

Just holding it in your hand is an experience, an adventure.  But if you want to do anything more than casual snapshots, this beauty's not for you.

So why, in the end, do I recommend this camera?  Well, the beauty and quality feel will seduce you.  And being able to carry a camera anywhere you go, with little weight penalty, is a fantastic opportunity to get out of the ordinary images, when you least expect them.
