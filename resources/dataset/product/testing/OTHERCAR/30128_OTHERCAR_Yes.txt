            My Chevy Nova was one of the best cars I've ever owned.  It was made by Toyota for Chevy; its really a Corolla.  So replacement parts can be a little more expensive than domestic cars.  On the plus side, you can get this Corolla cheaper than a regular Toyota because it doesn't carry the high aftermarket price that Toyotas have.

Some highlights:
The AC vents are placed perfectly for the front two passengers.

The seats are firm and comfortable for long trips.
The trunk lid does not just open the top part, but the whole back side, also.  This is very helpful when lifting heavy or bulky loads into the trunk.  I used to carry a lawn mower around a lot very easily.  Lots of cars have this feature now, but if you are looking at older cars its harder to find.

You can set the trunk so it opens without a key.  I rarely kept anything of value in my trunk, so I left it unlocked.  You just twist the knob to open it.  It made it easy to load things up, I didn't have to go fetch my keys out of the ignition, or turn the car off when it was cold outside just to get in the trunk.  If you do want to lock it, just put the key in and turn; then it will require the key to open every time until you set it back.

Its hard to lock yourself out, because you have to lift the outside handle when shutting the door with it locked, otherwise it just bounces back open.  This makes you think about the fact that you are shutting the door with it locked, and you may remember that your keys are still inside.  This took some getting used to, I think many foreign cars are like this.

The motor is very reliable, I never had any problems with it.  It did leak some oil, but when I got this car it had about 150K miles on it and it hadn't been taken care of the best.

I paid $300 for mine and had to put new tires and exhaust on it when I bought it.

Also note that the cigarette lighter plug is only 'on' when the key is turned on.  On most cars the plug is 'on' all the time.
