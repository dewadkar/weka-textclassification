            Looked and looked for a mid-sized SUV--only one met all my needs/wants.
Grand Cherokee was nice, but smaller inside, and a unibody--not great for towing.
Explorer okay, less roomy for driver (I'm 6' 3''), squishy suspension.  However, they're popular so dealers will bargain.
Lexus RX300 was very nice, but pricey and also unibody.
4Runner and Pathfinder nice, but not as roomy, and a lot more expensive.
Mercedes nice but pricey.
BMW just came out--nice but way pricey, wouldn't want to haul fertilizer in it.  Afraid to leave it anywhere.

Durango offers 3 seats, fits in the garage and is way powerful.
When shopping, I test-drove the 5.9 liter w/full-time AWD and the 4.7 liter with part-time 4WD.  Picked the 4.7 liter because I noticed almost no difference in performance and figured the 4.7 would be more fuel efficient.

Got the tow package with 3.92 rear gearing.  Have towed 6000# plus with no problem (even in the southeastern Pennsylvania foothills).
I love the interior design, the aggressive exterior looks, and outlandish performance.

With the rear gearing, and auto trans and part-time 4WD, I get 15-16 MPG in mixed driving (I got about 10 while towing).

Handling is A+:  Turns on a dime, great brakes!

Only nit-picks:
- I wish the rear window opened without having to open the whole tailgate.
- I wish there was an separate A/C switch so I could control it independently of the rest of the ventilation system (A/C operates automatically depending where you want the air to come out).
- I've noticed some suspension noise (urethane bushings?).
- Removing the oil filter on the 4.7 liter is MESSY--you have to go through an access hole on the front engine splashguard--awkward and always results in hot-dirty oil spilling on the inside of the splashguard and seeping out between it and the frame.
- Quality control not up to Japanese standards, but nothing unacceptable.

Gotta put a plug in for the dealer:
Templeton Dodge in Tysons Corner, VA:  If you have an e-mail address, they'll sell to you for $9 over invoice to take delivery off the lot (but be prepared for the hard sell on financing and after-market add-ons).
Salesman was knowledgeable, honest, and very hard working.
