            We purchased this car as a second vehicle -- the first is a 1998 Geo Metro Hatchback (also a wonderful car).  When I was a teen my mom had a Cavalier Convertable and loved it -- so did we!  Well we decided to get this car with everything in it (LS Sedan with all automatic).  In 5-6 years when we are ready for kids -- so will the car!  Very sporty looking even in the four door when you have the small spoiler type thing on the trunk.  Enough room for 4 larger adults (larger meaning heavy and tall!)  Definate A+  -- and I would buy it again.


The 1998 Cavalier is available in five models -- Cavalier base coupe, base sedan, RS coupe, LS sedan, Z24 coupe and Z24 convertible. Standard features offered in all models include four wheel anti-lock brakes, center console with armrest, Passlock theft deterrent system and daytime running lights. An AM/FM radio is now standard on the base coupe, base sedan and RS coupe. In addition, cruise control is now standard equipment on the RS coupe, LS sedan and Z24 coupe and convertible. New 15 cross-lace aluminum wheels are standard and only available on the Z24 coupe. Chevrolet has added Medium Gold Metallic to Cavalier's exterior color choices and a new monotone interior color scheme is available in Graphite, Medium Gray and Neutral.
