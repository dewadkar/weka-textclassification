            We were previous Ford owners but kept getting the run around on financeing with the dealer. We drove a 1998 contour for a week while trying to get reasonable interest rates. I finally got upset with them took the car in and got my title back on the trade in and left. I then drove to the chevrolet dealer. We talked about 5 minutes and I test drove the Malibu. I was very impressed with the comfort and handling. I sat down and we filled out the paper work. GM financed our 1998 Malibu at a much lower rate than I expected. After driving the Malibu for about a year and a half now we have had no problems. We are ready to trade the 2nd car in and we are still thinking about getting a second Malibu. We are that happy with the Malibu. From the time I walked in to the dealership to the time we drove the car home it took 3 hours, not 5 days. This say's a lot for GM no hassle buying.
