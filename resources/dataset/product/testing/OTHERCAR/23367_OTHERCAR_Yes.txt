            The Mercedes SUV is the best SUV of the year 2000 SUVs in my opinion.(That's a lot of SUVs)  It's got great handling for a car of it's size.  It has great tracking also.  It gets a good amount of miles per gallon also.  Mercedes Benz did a great job designing this car.  The company did a great job manufacturing this vehicle also.  Mercedes has made many great vehicles, this being one of the best.  There is a lot of space in this car, although it looks smaller.  People who like to travel in the lap of luxury should definitely buy this car.<br><br>
