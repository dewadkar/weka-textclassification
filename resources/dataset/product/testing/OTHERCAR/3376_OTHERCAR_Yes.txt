            I previously owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee and a Ford Explorer, and the Nissan Pathfinder 2001 blows them away.  My 2000 Explorer - which I sold after 3 months -- couldn't compare to Pathfinder's crisp handling.

The Pathfinder drives much more like a car than the Explorer or Jeep.  I always felt like I was about to flip on the Explorer, but not so on the Pathfinder.  It has a tighter steering wheel, and handles so much better.  The Jeep is a close second, but the Pathfinder definitely wins.  The ride is so quite. 

Another Pathfinder plus is the powerful engine, redesigned for 2001.  240 Horsepower is a LOT, and you can feel it.  Remarkably, the Pathfinder still gets as good as or better gas mileage than the Explorer and Jeep.  One negative though is that the Pathfinder takes premium gas (Explorer and Jeep take regular), so that can cost a lot of extra money in the long run.

If you figure 1000 gallons of gas per year (17,000 miles traveled, 17 MPG), using premium gas will run you an extra $200 a year (20 cents extra a gallon).  Not ideal, but definitely worth it for the Pathfinder's superior engine and handling.

The Pathfinder also has better features than the standard Explorer, but I really miss keyless entry and Explorer's top notch headlights.  Pathfinder does have one great feature:  the lights go off when the engine does.  I really enjoy this feature because I missed the automatic lights from my Jeep, but now I just leave the lights on all the time.  The standard CD player is also a 6 disc changer, which is very nice, and the Bose stereo is excellent.  Best of all, stereo controls on the steering wheel is standard -- which is both convenient and a good safety feature.  

This is the best SUV you can buy under $35,000.  <br><br>
