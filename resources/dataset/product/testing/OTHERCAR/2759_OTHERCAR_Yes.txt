            i bought my 1997 jetta &quot;jazz&quot; edition used a few months back. i am thoroughly in love with the car. 

i prefer the pre-1999 jetta to the current model, because of it's distinctive vw look; it has the classic boxy look that dates back to the first rabbits and dashers of the mid 70s. my girlfriends grandfather, in fact, commented that it looked like an updated version of his '77 dasher.

while some say the automatic transmission/ 4cylinder combo lacks pick up; i am inclined to disagree. i find the pick up and cruising ability to be more than adequate. on the highway, i have problems keeping it below 80 mph.

gas mileage could be better. i only get around 24 mpg around town, which is considerably less than my old toyota corolla and a couple of notches below my mazda protege.

build quality is very good; there are relatively few rattles. everything looks &quot;snapped&quot; together fairly well on the inside and out.

the only gripe i have with it is the new breed of volkswagen driver. i can'tt stand seeing all these trendy little &quot;friends&quot; clones driving around in their jettas. i remember when the jetta used to be the vehicle of artists and college professors, ie people with brains. now i see a lot of dumb blondes and the whole starbucks crowd tooling around in their  &quot;cute&quot; little jettas. it makes me ill...
