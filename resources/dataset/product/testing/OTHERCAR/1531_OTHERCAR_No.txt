            Saturn Sucks!  I bought a brand new SL1 in 1996 and now after only three and half years, it's already breaking down a few times.  It just died on me.  I had problems starting the engine and took it to the dealership.  I was told that the throttle body (?) in my fuel induction system was dirty and it would cost me $350 plus tax to fix it!  Asking them why this happened to me and all they could say was that this was not supposed to happen, and maybe it was the way I drive or the fuel I use.  Totally BS!  I've been driving for many years and never had any problem like this even with old cars.  I use gas from 76, Shell, Exxon, just like millions of other drivers out there.  It is the car!  It sucks!

Talking about their services, I have to wait at least 2 hours each time I have services done there, even for oil change ...

I will never buy another Saturn.
