            Over New Years my friends decided to teach me how to drive a stick and they said that my friend Garrett's Dodge Avenger was going to be the easiest to drive so I jumped in and took off and even though I had only ever driven a stick one other time (2 years ago) I had no problems picking it up again and I was driving and having no problems in no time flat.

But now for my review of the car it was a stick v6 and it was a 97 I believe while I was driving I did have one problem and that was finding the lights but once they were found it was easy to use (on the blinker switch if you need to find them). I went out driving on the main strip in town for about 2 hours and we drove through residential areas too and I had no problem in the stop and go situations. 

For a driver just learning to drive a stick it was really easy and I only killed it about 3 times. The car has great acceleration when you want it to accelerate and the brakes are fairly good too. This is after my friends brother had owned the car and he drove the car hard and put it away wet... so this car has had a lot of unnecessary wear and tear on it and it still performs like new. 

I would have to say when I get a new car I will go with the Dodge Avenger. It is absolutely a great car.<br><br>
