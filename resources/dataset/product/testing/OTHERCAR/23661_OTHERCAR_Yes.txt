            Fujifilm has with their new camera, Finepix 2650, proved that it can be very easy to use digital cameras. This camera is perfect for first-time users  who are looking for a user-friendly digital camera.

The Finepix 2650 is equipped with a 2.0 mega pixel CCD, and a comfortable automatic zoom with up to 3x. You can also use a digital zoom with 2,5x. The pictures will have 1600x1200, 1280x960, or 640x480 pixel resolution. In addition you can take short video clips in avi-format, and you can use it as a web camera. The memory card has 16 mb of  space which is pretty good in cameras like these. The camera has plenty of opportunities for manual settings, or you can choose automatic, which often gives the best pictures.

Once you look at the camera it may seem a little clotted, but it is still relatively compact and it doesn't weigh more than 250 grams. The construction is quite functional, too, which makes it easy to operate with one hand.

Though, the LCD display is quite large;1,8", it is way to dark and it has to weak contrast, which makes it difficult to look at it both outdoors and indoors. It is possible to set the light from the menu, but it doesn't help much.

Almost all settings are controlled trough the menu on the LCD display. Flash, self-timer, and macro are functions I would prefer to have own buttons for, but the menu is simple to navigate through, so it isn't a very big problem.

The picture quality is great, both indoors and out, and I was especially surprised by the outdoors pictures, with superb details even on long distance pictures. 

But be aware of that the camera is very fond of batteries and eats them up pretty fast.

Conclusion:
For me the Finepix 2650 has been a great buy. It is a camera with lots of functions, has a nice design, and it takes great pictures. The LCD display shows pictures badly, but the menu is clear and easy to operate. Battery life is too short.
