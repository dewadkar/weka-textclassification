            After logging 93,000 miles in my M3, I feel qualified to give an enthusiastic thumbs up to this vehicle. Let me get right to the point. 
     It looks great, unmodified, in it's original form.
     It absolutely loves to be driven. Corners like it's on rails.
     5 years old and still turns heads. 
     Everything in it works, and very little has needed to be fixed.
          (Exception: Dealer installed CD player is on the blink)
     Did I mention it's a blast to drive?

My personal (minor) gripes are as follows:
     the sunroof rattles, the radio sound is fair at best, the A/C 
     should blow colder and harder, and, and... that's about it!

Now, this is not the smoothest, most comfortable car.  But that is not it's mission.  The low profile tires don't give much and the suspension is quite unforgiving, but I, and you, shouldn't expect to be pampered in this sport coupe.  But if you like to go, stop, and turn at the limits, 
getcha one!!<br><br>
