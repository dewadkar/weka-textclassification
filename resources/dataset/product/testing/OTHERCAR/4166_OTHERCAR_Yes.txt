            This Cadillac is not a &quot;Cruella&quot; Deville!  I bought my 1999 Cadillac almost one year to the day. I've never loved a car more than I love this car. What a superb automobile.  GM really knew what they were doing with this model. It's a luxury car and muscle car all in one. I live in Dallas and have to drive on expressway frequently. When I'm in this car, I don't have a thing to worry about. It moves smoothly in and out of traffic.  It accellerates rapidly with a mere push of the pedal. I never worry about pulling out into the faster lane. With this car, I make up the faster lane.  The car is loaded with everything that counts. The leather is high quality. The stereo is top of the line.  At night, the special lighting system comes on so you are not blinded by the lights in back of you.  The cruise control works with a simple touch.  My family of four continually ride in style when they go in this car.  I traded my Cadillac Contera, and would never go back.  Out of all the vehicles I've owned, I definitely love this car the best!<br><br>
