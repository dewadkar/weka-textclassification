            I had my first race in the Type R today.  My regular car wasn't ready (99 Boxster).  This car is stock with Kumho race tires.

The drive up was pleasant if a bit bumpy.  We had to drive a little over an hour.  The car is stiffly sprung and on the highway, you feel the bumps.  It is not harsh, but definitely firm.

With the rear seats down, the hatch has plenty of room.  We had 6 extra wheels and rims, tools and plenty of room for at least 2 more wheels.

This was my first race in a Type R and also my first time with race tires, so I had to explore the limits of the car on race tires.  Besides a lot more traction, the race tires do not squeel when at the limit, so it is much harder to tell when you are at the limit.

For a front wheel drive, the car behaves very neutrally and turns in like a rear wheel drive.  Since the VTEC's do not kick in until you reach 5800 RPM, you do have to work the gears to get the most out of the car.  Something that I failed to do.  For a small engine, the car gets up and goes with abandon.  This car turned in some of the faster times compared to many other vehicles.

I did not have enough time in the car to really be able to compare the handling to the Boxster.  I also do not have Kumho's on my Boxster yet - later this year.  The immediate weakness that is apparent is that the car does not want to stop as quickly as the Boxster (at least it feels that way).  My co-driver was watching and confirmed that I had the front wheels locked up and the ABS did not seem to be working.

Now I understand why this car is considered to be one of the main vehicles to autocross in the GS class for autocross.

If you are looking for a vehicle to autocross in a competitive class and not have to sink a lot of money into making the vehicle competitive, this car is at the top of the list.  Highly recommended.<br><br>
