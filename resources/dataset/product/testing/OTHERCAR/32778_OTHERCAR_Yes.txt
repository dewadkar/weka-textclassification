            The S400 is my first digital camera, and only the second camera I have ever owned.  I've had it for almost two weeks now.  I choose it for:

1) Small size
2) Great pictures
3) Ease of use
4) Little to zero picture delay

I was also considering the Canon S45, and had researched reviews on 5 to 10 other sub-compact cameras from Milota, Canon, and Konica.  In the end, none of these other cameras had the same (reported by reviewers) picture quality and size as the S400.

Accessories I have purchased:

1) 256 MB Sandisk flash card
2) Lowepro DRes 8S weather resistant case (fits great)
You see my review of the case here:

Things I have liked about the camera:

1) Very easy to take videos
2) Very easy to capture a particular image/frame from videos using the camera controls
3) Amazing close-ups.  By changing the menu to the little flower icon, you can take pictures just an inch or so from an object.  I did this with a butterfly, and the results were nothing short of stunning.  You can see the individual hair follicles sticking out of the wings, which I could NOT see with my naked eyes (or at least didn't notice them).
4) Extremely pocketable
5) Software is fairly easy to use
6) The battery charger is not an AC adapter, but a very portable little thing that you slide the battery into, and then stick the whole charger into an AC adapter.  A little difficult to describe with words, but very useful and compact.
7) I guess the 4 megapixel part, but honestly, since I've never used another digital camera, I can't say how much better or worse the camera is than another one in terms of the digital detail.
8) Pictures taken while shaking come out very clear.  I've taken a picture from a plane (out of the window at 37,000 feet) and from a 30' sail boat while sailing, and both pictures came out beautifully even though my hands weren't that steady.
9) THIS IS IMPORTANT - there is almost no delay from when you depress the shutter button and when the picture is actually taken.  A lot of cameras do have a delay, and that can be annoying at best, and result in missing the perfect shot at worst.
10) Can display a little histogram of pictures taken (on the fly), showing you what parts of the picture (not physically, just in terms of camera settings) that are not perfect.  Allowing you to make adjustments that are suggested, and re-take the picture.

Things I have not liked so much:

1) Cannot zoom in on videos while reviewing on the camera
2) The manual viewfinder does not 'see' the entire picture.  It cuts off the top part, although the LCD does 'see' the entire space you will capture in a picture.
3) LCD is a little weaker than I would have liked.  I have no idea how it compares to other camera's screens, but it's difficult to make out far off details that I can easily see with the naked eye.
4) Unsure how 'weatherproof' the lens closure is.  I've been told by a guy at Wolf Camera that even the Olympus sliding closures lets in rain drops, but I would feel more comfortable if the camera had that type of closure.
5) You can overcharge the battery if not careful.  It takes less than two hours to charge the battery, and you will harm the battery if you charge it for more than 24 hours.
6) The videos are a maximum of 320 x 160 resolution.  I think for some people, a big benefit of the video part is to video-capture then keep single images of little kids.  But since the resolution is kind of low, this may not turn out so great.
7) Battery life is a little low.
8) 32 MB card is fairly useless because of how little it can store.  I kind of wish they had just left off the card and saved me a few bucks on the price.
9) Does not come with a protective case.
10) Limited advanced functions - uh, so I hear.  Really hasn't affected me yet.

Some settings that I have played with:

1) You can change the volume of almost any particular function.  For example, when it starts up, it makes a little pleasant ring.  When you move around the menus, another little ring.
2) You can change the LCD brightness, and it pays to do so in daylight.
3) You change the picture that it shows when it starts up.  I was thinking of changing mine to show my name and phone number so the camera can be returned if I misplace it one day.
4) Fully automatic mode versus manual settings mode.  And in manual settings mode, you can still tell it to use the automatic settings for any or all of the various functions (aperature, whiteness, etc)
5) Zoom in on pictures on the camera itself.  That's really cool actually.  I've taken a picture of books across the room, and then can zoom in (on the captured picture) to the point of reading the fine print on the books.
6) View pictures as thumbnails on the LCD -- 9 at a time.

Other than this, if you are looking for all the technical details, I'm afraid I'm not the person to provide them.  I'm a novice, and this review really reflects how I use the camera.

Bottom Line:
Buy it!  Buy it now! Okay seriously, if you don't need a lot of custom settings, and really value a small form factor, this is the perfect camera for you.  You are definitely paying incremental dollars for that small size -- so don't get it if you don't care about the size.  And you are definitely giving up advanced functions (from what I can tell, which is a little limited).

I bought the camera at Beach Camera.  My review can be seen here:
