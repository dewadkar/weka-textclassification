            In Canada, this is called the Chrysler Intrepid.  Different badge, but the same car that you Yanks buy as a Dodge.  I've always wanted to buy one of these, but couldn't afford the price.  But, then one holiday weekend, when it was illegal for a dealership to be open, I walked onto a lot to look at the Intrepids.  One thing led to another and before I knew it, I was test driving a shiny, new Slate Black coloured model.  Six and a half minutes later, the salesman offered me a trade on my old Sunfire I couldn't pass up.  After another 45 minutes of doing paperwork and proving I had the credit I was headed off the lot in my NEW CAR with the very definite impression that I hadn't been screwed!

This is the nicest car I've ever owned and after nine months and driving it for 37,000 kilometres, I still get a rush every time I crank the engine and pull out of my driveway.  The 200 hp engine is strong, the ride is quiet and it handles as well as cars twice the price.  There's not been even so much as a hint of a problem with it.  This car is WELL built and the fit and finish is flawless.  There's plenty of room for 5 adults to ride in complete comfort and the driver has as unobstructed a 360 degree view you can get in a vehicle.  One drive and you'll wonder what it was you ever saw in the Camry or the Accord costing thousands more, similarly equipped.  Do you want value for your dollar?  This is it!

For all you Americans who are hooked on imports, take a hard look at the Chrysler Intrepid.  Open up the driver's door and check out the DaimlerChrysler sticker on the post.  It says &quot;Made in Canada&quot;.  Surprised?  Don't be.  We simply build them better than you do!<br><br>
