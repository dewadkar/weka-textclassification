            This review is long winded however, it was a long story in my life.
Back in the early 90's I used to see people driving around in the Amigo with the top down.  It seemed very appealing to a young person.  Then Isuzu decided to discontinue the line for a while.  I was a bit disappointed but made do.  Then back in 1998 they were BACK and cooler than ever!  So, I rushed out and bought one of the first in the state.  I finally got a car I always wanted.  I bought the 4 cylinder because it was in my price range, not because I am economical, gas conscious or anything.  

I think it is a really neat car with fun amenities, sun roof, convertible, tailgate... but then reality hit.   It was about June 1st 2000 when it all started.  I was driving to pick up my friend.  I had noticed I needed some gas and decided to pull in.  Just as I made the turn into the gas station the car died.  I could not start it.  I called the towing service to have it picked up.  Towing is complimentary for Isuzu owners.  Now, I have forgotten to mention that a couple of months prior, I had the exhaust system replaced because there was a bad baffle which caused the car to sound more like a Harley.  The exhaust system didn't seem to stay fixed.  I had to take it back for them to work on it again.  I digress, basically, it was in the shop before and now it was going back.  It was only 2 years old and had 52K miles.  I was upset.  Then I got the call from the dealership fixing the vehicle.  They said the starter was bad and the tensioning belt for the timing belt broke.  That caused a litany of other problems.  The tensioning belt broke which broke the timing belt when that broke it hit the oil pump and breaking it.  About this time I started to wonder, what about the engine.  That's when the mechanic told me that they have to fix all these problems in order to check to see if the engine is all right.  Well, weeks passed and calls were exchanged.  Come to find out, they broke a bolt while taking off the oil pump which caused more of a delay.  We waited for parts, mechanics, Venus to be aligned with mars and finally they call...
The engine need to be completely replaced.  &quot;How long does that take?&quot; I exclaimed.  &quot;Once it's in, it only takes about a day to get it in&quot;, he told me.  But then it came, &quot;but, the problem is, the engine for this vehicle is made in Australia and it is on national backorder.&quot;
&quot;WHAT?&quot;
Apparently, they could not make the engines fast enough, or correctly.  So, I waited and waited a month past, then 2.  I called, called, complained, complained.  I even tried posting an article at another web site that deals in complaints.  I got a response even.  It just so happens that the very same thing happened to someone else that actually worked for Isuzu.  He was stuck as well.  He went to the guys who actually engineer the 4 cylinder engine and asked about it.  He told me that they were all laughing at his purchase and said they'd never seen a worse engine.
Well, needless to say, 3 months past.  In that time, the received an engine installed it and did that incorrectly.  So we had to order another one.  4 months passed.  It arrived and it was installed correctly.  I went to pick up the auto to find it making a weird whining noise from the main belt.  The head mechanic told me, they only replaced the engine, the belt was old and needed to be replaced to correct that problem.  
I will say this, I did get a rental for all that time, but I had to complain to get upgraded from a super sub compact with no power steering.
And they didn't charge me for the starter needing replacement, which they told me, coincidentally, had nothing to do with any of this.  And, it was all covered by my warranty, luckily!
The car is now sluggish, eats gas like a hog.
I would say, stay clear of all Isuzu models using the same 4 cylinder engine.  I was told that the 6 cylinder is a much better, stable engine.

Oh! And there have been numerous recalls on this vehicle for different manufacturing errors.  Hereï¿½s just one, the sunroof has a plastic piece that covers it if you want to keep the sun out.  There was a tendency for these to break off while people were driving and clunk them in the head.  They weigh about 4-5 pounds.
