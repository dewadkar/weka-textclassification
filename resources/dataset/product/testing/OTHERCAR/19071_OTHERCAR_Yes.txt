            This is my second Olympus and it has been a joy to use. The images are sharp and well exposed every time. My first camera lacked a zoom lens, which I believe is essential to any good camera. The 2020 has a great little zoom together with a tack sharp lens. I also purchased the Olympus &quot;floppy drive&quot; card which makes putting pictures into my computer a cinch.  For those using this device, you may wish to use the Windows Explorer mode to copy the images from the A drive (remember to click the A drive twice to see the list of photos) to a specific directory on the HD. After that I tell Explorer to erase all the images from the Sim card which is a must faster technique that using Olympus' software to do the same job.

I have larger hands, so the camera size is a bit small and I do with the menu was a bit more user friendly..but that just may be my problem. On the other hand, it is easy to carry. All in all a great little camera and I can't wait to et my hands on the new 3030 version. And oh yes you will most likely lose the lens cap in short order. We found a white camera &quot;cap&quot; that slid over the entire lens and stays put. <br><br>
