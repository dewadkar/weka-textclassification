            I used to hate cars.  I used to vow that I would have the ugliest car on the block.  The '89 Camry I drove for a while was certainly reliable and had good space and lots of features, but it sure wasn't much to look at.  

When I decided to get a new car, I found the new Camrys (or is that Camries?) were too expensive and the Corolla, for all its reliablity, was a little bit too unnatractive, even by my lofty standards.  The result: Mazda MX-3.

Why did I get it?  I'm engaged, so it couldn't have been to pick up girls.  I'm engaged I might add to a WOMAN so, my residency in West Hollywood notwithstanding, it couldn't have been to pick up guys (I got a white one so it would reflect the heat better.)  What we have is a car that looks, runs and handles great.  It is very smooth and comfortable; the back seats can get a little cramped, but hey, the steering wheel is in the front, so what's the rush?  While my particular Mazda is not big on extras, it has nice features such as map lights, adjustable mirrors and a buzzer that goes off when I turn off the car with the lights still on (I wore out at least one battery on the Toyota leaving the lights on.)  Parallel parking, while not quite a pleasure, is certainly a piece of cake.  The car's small size makes it very maneuverable, yet its capacity is just as much as that of the Toyota Camry.

Overall, the Mazda MX-3 is a good alternative to the Honda Civic or the Toyota Celica.  It is considerably less expensive and gets the job done just as well.<br><br>
