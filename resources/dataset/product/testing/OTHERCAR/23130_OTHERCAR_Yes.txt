            I purchased this car from the showroom after I first laid eyes on it, took it for a test spin and i was sold... driveability is excellent, it doesnt bottom out on tight turns, the autostick (a manual and and on-the-fly-automatic) comes in great for slowdowns, passing, hills and just general fun driving... the controls in the steering wheel are handy and so is the analog/digital display panel... if you get this car, get the power seat option, its comfy... another feature i like is the in-dash cartridge cd player, its well hidden and sounds great... i've put 40000 miles on this car and it still drives like new... no problems so far... and... the rear seat folds down (it can be locked) giving you twice the trunk space, which is very large as it is, and the &quot;net&quot; in the trunk keeps things from sliding around... plus this car comes with a full size spare, you dont see that very much anymore... the best yet, this car gets about 24 miles to the gallon average in the city, and i can go about 325 miles on a tank, not bad for its size and weight, the stratus has plenty of features i didnt find in other cars... its safe, looks good, fast when you need it and stops &quot;on a dime&quot;, i really love to drive this car... anyone that has had previous experience with a dodge product, get this one!!!<br><br>
