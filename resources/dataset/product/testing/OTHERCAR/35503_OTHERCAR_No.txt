            My 1999 Honda Odyssey EX was a long awaited welcome change from my 1996 Plymouth Grand Voyager, which was plagued with problems.  I love the seat configuration in the Odyssey and especially the easily stowed rear seat.  With 4 small children, I the automatic power sliding doors were the biggest selling point for me.  But, OUCH!!! One day after buckling a child into a car seat, I hit the remote button to close the door.  Unfortunately, I somehow managed to have my index finger in the door path.  The door did not magically reverse direction, as advertised (&quot;wouldn't break a kite&quot;).  I attempted unsuccessfully to get the door to change direction or at least stop.  No luck.  The result-my index fingernail was &quot;popped&quot;  out of the nail bed and my cuticle was completely severed.  It doesn't look like the finger will ever be the same.  I am thankful it wasn't my child's hand or head! 

Another power door incident - 
I was parked next to a 4 door sedan in a rather tight parking lot.  After unloading the kids, I hit the button to close the sliding doors.  The driver next to me opened her door almost simultaneously.  The very end of her door was in the path of my door, which again refused to reverse direction after meeting resistance.  I ran up and grabbed the door with all my might to avoid ripping her door off the hinge.  My door tore the rubber stripping on her door.

I have attempted to use the doors in the &quot;manual&quot; mode.  Nearly impossible.  

Beware!
