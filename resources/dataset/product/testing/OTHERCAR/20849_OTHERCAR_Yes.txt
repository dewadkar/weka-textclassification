            I've been following the Prius development for years.  I was able to get one from the first shipment to California.  I have 7,000 miles on it, so far.  It has been a real joy to drive.

It becomes a game to maximize your mileage.  I changed my route to work to take a more leisurely surface street, instead of the freeway, and I can get 63 mpg over my 12 mile commute.  Amazingly, my total commute time has remained unchanged.

The silence of the vehicle and the advanced LCD energy and fuel consumption monitoring make driving seem like a futuristic mission rather than a road rage, rat race, gas guzzling, stress provoking grind.  It really has made driving enjoyable.  There is plenty of room for four people and plenty of trunk space.

I am planning to keep my Prius until fuel cells are practical.  Pure electric cars have too many disadvantages.  Hybrids are the way to go, for now.  

I only wish the 2001 model had the GPS and cruise control available.  But, I couldn't wait.  I am very happy with mine, just as it is.

I just read some of the other epinions on the Prius and noticed some misinformation in several.  One is the purpose of the &quot;B&quot; setting on the transmission.  It's function is for long downhill grades where you would switch to 2nd or 1st in a normal car.  The Prius has a continuous variable transmission and never switches gears like conventional cars.  Switching to &quot;B&quot; puts a generator load on the wheels to slow you down so you don't need to ride the brakes.  This is it's only purpose.  Anything you may read in other epinions is false.<br><br>
