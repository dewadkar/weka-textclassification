            My wife and I bought this car wanting a nice car with plenty of room and safety for our kids.  Well Chevrolet pulled out the old standard Impala.

It has more than enough room for all of us to ride in comfort and the seat choice chevy used was great they are truly comfortable which is suprising for me I had back surgery in march and these seats are better than my Lazy Boy.

There are 2 packages you can buy a standard and a LS model.  We went with the LS model and paid a few more thousand and got the larger V6 which has all kinds of power and gets fantastic gas mileage (it really suprised me) We had a grand am and monthly gas bill dropped about 40% and the motor in the Impala is bigger.  It also has a sporty style with the moldings and Spoiler and all kinds of gadgets for the inside, Onstar which I like my wife has to drive 35 miles to work and leaves in the early am and with a touch of a button she can have police ambulance on the way and with the onstar package it has a built in phone and you get the Onstar service free for One year, It also has the GPS built in. The car has a huge trunk, and the back seats lay down so you could haul about anything you wanted.

The interior is People friendly, Killer sound system with easy to use controls,  And what a ride this car has it rides like your dads Caddy but about half the price.

We truly could not be more satisfied with this car it offers everything you want a car to give and the price is not that high compared to alot out there, that are not half the car this one is.  I am considering selling my truck and buying one for my daily driving.

If you have any questions about this car email me I would be glad to answer.
