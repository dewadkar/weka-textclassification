            I purchased a green, year 2000 Volvo S-40 last summer, and since last August I have put 8,000 miles on the car so I feel I now know the car enough to write a review on it. 

The first thing you will notice about the car is that it is on the small side.  I am 6ft 1in, and I find that I can hardly sit in the back seat with out jamming my knees into the person in the front.  The back is fine for younger people, but adults should stick to the front.  The drivers seat doesn�t have the space problems the back does.  I find as long as the chair is all the way back my knees won�t hit the steering wheel.  I choose to have a sun roof in the car, but be warned this will make the ceiling a few inches shorter.  My head comes right up to the ceiling with the sunroof installed.  If you are any taller then about 6ft you will want to test this car out before you buy it specifically looking to see if you don�t mind the tight spaces.  If you want something bigger look at the S-80, but that also costs about $10,000 more.  If you can't afford to step up to the S-80, make sure you won't have adults riding in the back seat on a regular basis, they won't enjoy the ride at all.

The only other car I have driven enough to feel like I can compare the handling to is my families other car, the Mercedes Benz S-500.  Compared to the MB the Volvo is a much firmer ride.  At higher speeds you will really start to notice the bumps in the road, and the ride will be much less smooth.  At high speeds on the highway I do feel like the Volvo is gripping the road much better then the MB, and I prefer this in a car.  The Volvo is a light car and will coast very well.  This helps achieve the 24-28 mpg that I get in the Volvo.

The interior controls of the car are nicely positioned.  The back seats come with few amenities, but there is a cup holder at food level between the seats, and a fold down armrest.  The radio/cd controls in the front are nicely placed.  All of the buttons are very straightforward and easy to figure out, something not found in higher end cars like our MB.  The CD player is a 1-disk slot right above the controls.  Many cars I have seen have a six-cd holder in the back trunk, but I like having cd slot up front.  This makes changing cds a whole lot easier.  The only problem I have with the front controls is that the front seat cup holder comes out from the front area, and when used it will block some of the buttons.

The car doesn�t have the greatest engine, truthfully I have no idea how many horsepower it is because that isn�t something that interests me enough to find out.  I do know that the car comes with turbo, making it no problem to accelerate quickly.

The new Volvo S-40 (and S-80) look much better then the previous Volvos.  The car doesn�t have the old box look like older Volvos, the new car is very aesthetically pleasing, with nice curves and an over all better look.
