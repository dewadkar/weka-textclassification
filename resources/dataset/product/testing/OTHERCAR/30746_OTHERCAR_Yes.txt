            When I first saw digital cameras, I loved the idea of instantly being able to see what the picture looks like.  But I didn't think the picture quality was good enough to be worth the cash.  After all, who wants to spend that kind of money to take poor quality pictures?

After hearing the rave reviews of the Olympus D340-R, I decided I wanted to give digital photography a try.  So, I wandered down to my local camera store and bought the camera for $300.

The quality of the pictures are nothing short of astounding!  Especially in bright light, you can see every detail in the picture.  Even in less than perfect lighting conditions, the camera still cranks out high quality pictures (although a tripod is a must for half-second exposures).

The pictures are good enough that, since I bought the camera 6 months ago, I have only taken one roll with my non-digital camera, but over 400 pictures with my digital camera.  Also, you can purchase standard 3.3 volt SmartMedia cards for unlimited picture storage, rather than having a fixed memory inside the camera.

One major caveat with the Olympus and all digital cameras is that, if you use the LCD viewfinder a lot, you WILL chew through batteries faster than Pac-Man chews through dots.  I highly recommend using some NiMH batteries and a recharger (cost $30 or so) if you plan to do a lot of picture-taking.

However, digital photography isn't for everyone.  If you mainly take the pictures to send to friends over email, or for your personal reference, digital photography can save you a fortune.

But, if you want a lot of prints of your pictures, digital photography is a waste of money.

In conclusion, if you've been waiting for a camera good enough to replace your old point-and-shoot compact, the D340-R is for you!  If you seek professional level printed pictures, this camera won't meet your needs.
