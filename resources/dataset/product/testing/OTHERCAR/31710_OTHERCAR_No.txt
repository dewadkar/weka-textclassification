            In the past two weeks I have had the opportunity to drive the 2000 Dodge Intrepid on some rather extensive road trips.  I have covered over 1200 miles in a few short weeks with the Intrepid.  Although to be upfront, this is not my car, but a state owned vehicle.  

Although I do not personally own this car, I believe that a two week long distance road trip with a particular car provides me perhaps with a bit more insight then even a person who newly owns this car, yet hasn't had the opportunity to test it out on a long road trip.

The SE model (which is the Intrepid I was driving, is equipped with a twin-cam, 24 valve, 2.7 liter V6 engine.  What this basically means for the average car consumer is that the Dodge Intrepid has power and lots of it.  This car is great for speeding past slower moving cars in two lane traffic.

This car handles marginally well on those curves and hills that most of us run into one time or another when on long distance treks.  The majority of the time, I felt in control of the car, however, there were a few hairpin turns where I experienced the feeling that this the car wasn't responding as fast as I would have liked.  Keep in mind, I am not a speed demon either, I am the person most people usually pass on the highway because of my annoying habit of driving the speed limit.

The Intrepid only comes with an automatic transmission, so those who love manual drive, this is not the most likely car for you.  It has a great sized trunk, with plenty of room for larger items or that once a month major shopping trip to the grocery store.

The interior leaves great room for improvement.  The front seats are bucket style, leaving only room for two people.  The seats best remind me of coach class on an airline.  There is absolutely no lumbar support, and my feet were constantly falling asleep because the seats are so low to the ground.  I found myself developing a nagging and annoying backache after only two hours on the road.

In between the bucket seats is a storage caddy for tapes and such, along with a small cup holder that neatly folds inside the storage caddy when not in use.  Although useful, the caddy leaves little in the way of extra room in the front seat.  For ladies, this can be a problem when there is a front seat passenger, as there is absolutely no place to neatly tuck a purse.

The back seat offers little leg room for passengers, but surprisingly enough, the back seats do offer some lumbar support.  In fact, when compared to the front seats, this is one car I would prefer being a back seat passenger.

The heat/air conditioning knobs are easy to access and understand.  The biggest obstacle is remembering to push the one extra button to get the air conditioning started.  Several times, I turned on the a/c only to realize it wasn't getting any cooler in the car, hence I forgot the little a/c button.  While on the topic of the a/c, I found this car didn't cool down very quickly or very well.  Rolling down the windows seemed as effective.

On the plus side, the Intrepid does get pretty good gas mileage for a larger car.  I got 31 mpg on the highway with the Intrepid, which is better than my Ford Taurus at 27 mpg.  Of course, I figure it would still be cheaper to drive my Taurus, as after driving the Intrepid, I need a visit to the chiropractor, and had I driving my Taurus, I could avoid another medical bill. 

My overall impression of the Dodge Intrepid?  Keep on looking, there are better cars available in this price range!
