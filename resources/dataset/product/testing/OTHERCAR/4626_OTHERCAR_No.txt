            Hello all, only my second review...bear with me and I noticed another review on this camera but only two people rated it...somewhat helpful. the poor guy...i feel so bad i guess SH hurts too much. Bear with us newbies, we do try you know! Erhm..I just noticed I wrote BEAR and not bare...wait...it SHOULD be BEAR...er...uh oh my blonde roots are showing.

There is no other way to go about it: Cheap may mean a good bargain to some, but cheap always means CHEAP to me. Cheap in the sense of quality, functionality, reliability...

Upon holding this camera, amazement is what I'd use to describe the first impression - amazement at how light it is. And also how super plastic-ky it feels!

A look at the bottom reveals it is made in china...so that quickly translated in my mind that this camera probably costs Olympus only $12.98 to manufacture in bulk. I also have a mobile pc that is made in china...that thing feels like a throwaway generic clone. What is it with these cost cutting measures? Make them at super low cost and sell them back at 10 times cost price and market it as cheap and high quality? 

Well that's alright if it feels plasticky, it is after all, made of all plastics (duh). But how does it perform?

Picture wise, this 2 megapixel camera is fine for a budget entry level digital camera. Photos are a bit too warm, and there is a slight color cast. I suppose these can be corrected through software correction.

Feature wise? A self-timer (12 seconds) QuickTime movie mode at 15 frames per second, Exif 2.2 support and panaroma stitching with the including Olympus Camedia Master software. 

Camera uses the tiny XD picture card and can get lost easily, it is very very small. It comes with a 16 mb card and 2 AA sized alkaline batteries. It can also take rechargeables which is good.

This camera really isn't cheap at $150+ as it just feels soooo...well...go pick one up yourself at a store and you'll know what I mean. I would price this really at $19.99 as a one-time used camera. 

But I guess the Olympus name on it gives it more credibility than it probably deserves. I would have thought the quality may be better if it was made in another low cost country such as Malaysia. My Sony Walkman is made in Malaysia and it is built very well, and cheap too. Heck, even my college sweater is made in Malaysia! But some of the t-shirts are made in China. Okay so even Colleges need to cut cost. I suppose the Levi's we wear are made in Indonesia and pressed/branded in the US to give it an authentic feel? 

Sorry I have no idea how I digressed. The woes of writing...

Back to the camera, all you seasoned pros, so what else to include in a camera review? The camera specifications and details? Isn't that already accesible simply clicking on the link right on top of this product's page? 

Well, if you are looking to buy this camera, I suggest you pick one up at a real store first before you place an order online. The picture quality is acceptable and actually quite nice for a cheap camera (definitely better than the el-cheapo made-in-no-where 5 megapixel nonsense you sometimes see touted by no-name makers).

I only wonder just how long will this camera last...more than a week? A month? Under heavy use, its buttons will probably fall off one by one or all at once. 

Now to go dye my roots. :P
