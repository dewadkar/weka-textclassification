            The P71 is the smallest and cheapest model in Sony's CyberShot range to feature optical zoom, but apart from this, it is more or less identical to the smaller P51 in terms of features.  The most visible sign that you have paid more for the P71 is when you turn it on, and the little motorized lens pops out ready for action.  We'll start with the familiar stuff, the P71 being familiar to anyone who has used a Sony digicam before, with the traditional "compass key" driven menus, and a natty 1 1/4" LCD viewfinder on the back which also shows various on-screen options (battery life, remaining memory, focus settings etc etc.)  Storage is via Sony's now familiar "Memory Stick" chips, available in 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128MB capacities.

Standard photo mode is very flexible, white balance and sharpness being available in "real-time".  The zoom is 4x optical, after which repeated pressing of the "T" key will cause the camera to automatically switch over to digital zoom for the final 2x.  Digital effects such as monochrome, Sepia, Solarise and Negative Art can also be brought into play.  The camera is extremely easy to use - simply point at the subject, press the shutter release down to the first stop, wait for the green light while it focuses, decides whether or not it needs the flash.....then take the picture.   The resolution is impressive at 3.2 megapixels, and in my experience, this is more than adequate for the most serious amateur.

You get a decent play mode as well, all the shots can be viewed in thumbnail mode and multiple deletes can be made, as well as basic rotate and crop operations.  You can also zoom and pan each shot in the viewfinder in play mode as well.  Downloading the pictures to your PC is via USB, the camera comes supplied with the necessary cables and software drivers to allow this.  There is also a "video out" socket to allow you to connect the camera to a TV set so you can look at your pictures on the television screen.

Most useful is the "Scene" mode, which automatically adjusts the apeture size and exposure time etc. for night-time shots.  Not much completely manual control of the settings is possible, but the three preset scenes (nighttime, foreground highlight, and landscape) probably do enough for the enthusiastic amateur.

The P71 uses two AA size Ni-Mh batteries, which can give about 160 minutes continuous usage if yor lucky.  In my experience however, it is a lot less than that - particularly if you are using the flash a lot.  This is one power hungry device.  Use ordinary drycell batteries in it (you can't use Alkalines unfortunately), and they will be dead in minutes.  Spare Ni-Mh cells are therefore a necessity, only if they didn't take a mind-numbing 13 hours to recharge from flat fully using the supplied charger. 

To this end, it's useful to have a "DC-in" connector to enable to run the camera from the wall socket just in case you need to do something in a hurry but your batteries are shot.  The P71 duly obliges, but the required mains adaptor is an expensive optional accessory. 

Another gripe is the lack of a decent carry case as standard.  Given that it will spend most of its time getting banged around in bags, rucksacks and pockets, surely even a cheapo wallet of some kind isn't too much to ask....other manufacturer's supply them.  And the plastic used for the P71's casing looks as though it will scratch easily into the bargain.  But at least Sony gains points for supplying it with a 16MB memory stick - not overly generous, but better than the stingy 8MB they give you with the more expensive S75 / S85.

On the whole, the D71 is perfect for the enthusastic amateur who wants to produce near-professional quality pictures but doesn't want to think about it too much, and for the money it has an impressive feature set.  Highly recommended.
