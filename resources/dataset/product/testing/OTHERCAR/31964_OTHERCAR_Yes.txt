              Our family outgrew our 1992 Civic in later 1999 and it was time to start searching for a larger vehicle. After finally making the decision to go with the SUV (our other option was a minivan) we quickly decided on the Honda Passport. The decision was relatively easy because of our past experiences with Honda, so the search for the &quot;right&quot; Passport was on.
  We ended up at a local dealership that had a 2000 Passport EX 4wd, which was a company demo car with 800 miles. The color was silver which was not our first choice but we felt we were getting an exceptional deal at $25,900.
  The Passport features power windows, locks, a/c mud guards, dual power heated mirrors, rear defrost, cargo net,rear privacy glass and a power moon roof! and those features are all standard on the EX 4wd model!!!!
  We opted for the luxury package, which was available at a relatively low cost. This package consisted of body side moldings, am/fm cassette and cd changer,leather seats and door panels and fender flares.
  The engine is not overly powerful with 6cyls.and 3.2 litres. The information we received upon purchase stated gas mileage as 16/20 mpg, but it is actually a little higher in the city. We figured ours at 19/24mpg.
  We now have 6,000 miles on the vehicle and look to put plenty more on. This is a very comfortable ride. It seats 5 and really has superior road handling. The rear seats are just as comfortable as the front and you hear little to no outside noise, which is a god send when the kids nap on trips!
   Going back to the engine a minute here, I really think Honda would have been better off going with a v8 in the 4wd models. I notice that, when pulling the camper or boat, I could really put that extra horsepower to use.
   The Passport is not as roomy as a minivan but a perfect fit for a family of four. Even when camping or taking a daytrip it is never a problem fitting us and all our gear. A great buy.!<br><br>
