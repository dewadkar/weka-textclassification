            I bought my 2002 Jaguar X-Type 2.5 in April, and so far the car has proven to be pretty solid, however there are some flaws to point out.  First of all, the car is a bit too sluggish for me. Driver handbook says the 2.5 liter version will go 0-60 in 8.5 seconds.  It feels even a bit slower than that. Another concern is the transmission. This car has by far the most unresponsive, mismatched automatic transmission I have ever driven! Upshifts take forever, and 1st gear is amazingly too short, and too get any power out of the car at hight speeds, you have to continually make it downshift...rediculous on the highway!! Lastly, in cold weather when you hit the gas, the car putters along like it 25 years old, and barely moves.  Solution? Rev the engine in PARK for about 10 seconds before you start to go.  Dealer said they can't find the problem, and i don't see how that could be. My 15-year old BMW 635CSi never once pulled this...However, after all the bad is settled, the car does perform nicely during cornering on twisting mountain roads, and reponse is very pleasing.  I find the seats to be rather supportive, and the instrumentation is laid out precisly for reach.  I WOULD NOT recommend anyone to BUY this car, only because it seems that down the line, the car could prove to be a very costly car to maintain, so thats why I leased mine.  In 3 years i could turn it in.  Overall, not a bad car for the money.  My car is the 2.5 model, fully loaded w/ no sport package.
