            Everyone has certain expectations when they hear the name �Corvette,� some positive, some negative.  The name Corvette has a checkered past.  First developed by GM to win the hearts of Americans who had recently been introduced to the European sports car, thanks in part to WWII service men who remembered how fun and nimble the cars were �over there.�  The Vettes of the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s were shadows of their former selves, barely cranking out enough horsepower to be considered sporty, let alone a serious sports car.  By the late 1980s the Corvette name was starting to mean something again, thanks in no small part to the ZR-1.

Now comes the C-5, the 5th generation of Corvette automobiles. It is by far the best yet.  The new Corvette somehow manages  to capture the sheer thrill and muscle of the old big block Sting Ray, the beauty of the split-window, combined with the finesse and grace of some European exotics often costing four times the Vette�s Chevrolet like price.  Now add the daily drivability of  a car like the current Ford Mustang and you�ll begin to understand that the Corvette is really quite a bargain.  

Inside the Corvette, the driver�s seat is a long drop if you are over 5� 10.� Once your butt hits the seat, there is comfort and support not normally found on cars with this much power under the hood.  Surely even the most  ill-tempered driver can find a comfortable position, as the driver�s seat has more options than a Craft-Matic Adjustable bed.  There is plenty of head and leg room.  Hip room is a little tight if you tend to be on the bigger side.  Pedals and shifter fall to hand nicely, and most secondary controls are an easy reach and lack the �plasticy� feel found on most other GM products.  Although the heads-up display is distracting at first, it is quite useful while negotiating curves at speed, or for passing time in rush hour traffic (some people are easy to amuse). The 12 disc CD changer also helps to pass that time.  Overall the Corvette�s cabin is a pleasant place to spend time.  There are 4 complaints (some minor) about the Corvette�s interior : 1) At $43,000 or more, there should be steering wheel mounted audio controls.  Even the lowly  Buick Regal has that option.  2) The upright part of the seats should not be manually adjusting.  Power please !  3) The automatic transmission version should have a dash mounted gear indicator. A simple PRNDL23 below the speedometer would do. 4) The climate control is too cumbersome, and it seems virtually impossible to run cool air over the front windshield without engaging the A/C compressor.

On the road is where the Corvette really shines.  Comparisons to the Chevrolet Camaro SS or Pontiac Firebird WS6 are totally unfounded.  One drive in each of those cars and the Corvette�s superiority is obvious.  Engineers at   Chevrolet have done with the Corvette something they seem unable or unwilling to do with the divisions other cars � sports car character with an underlying level of refinement.  This is where the Camaro falls far short of the Corvette.  The Camaro SS is certainly fast, but also very crude,  and brutish.  On the playground, the Camaro is the kid who thinks he can kick everybody�s butt, and acts like it.  The Corvette is like the kid that CAN kick everybody�s butt, yet never shows it.  Alright, maybe the Vette is not that subtle, but it surely has less to prove.

From behind the wheel, the 2001 Corvette is nothing short of pure fun.  When is the last time you drove a car that brought a smile to your face?  The Corvette is just such a car, and the key is  a 5.7 L, 350 hp V-8 lurking beneath the fiberglass body work. Gently squeeze the gas, and you�ll hit 70 mph in no time - the near perfect exhaust note only adds to the fun.  Handling is excellent.  With the active handling system on, the car is virtually idiot proof.  Hit a tight freeway onramp at 65 mph and�  nothing, the car just takes the curve with no drama, and barely a squeal from the mile wide tires. The active handling uses a combination of  spark retard, and automatic, selective brake application which makes it difficult to get in serious trouble.  That is really the beauty of this car,  its got super car performance and handling, packaged for the average Joe.  If you�re a little green behind the wheel, you should never turn the active handling off, that  is a sure fire way to get in over your head.  The sport suspension takes away some of the comfort during highway travels, but the lack of body roll is frankly astounding.  Even during hard braking and cornering, the Corvette never felt upset, or unstable.  On the down side, the sport suspension lets the driver feel every ripple and crack on rough or uneven pavement.  Road noise is a minor complaint, and should be better controlled for over $40,000.

Overall, the 2001 Corvette coupe is a world class sports car, with a Chevrolet  price tag.  Storage space is adequate, power is plentiful and handling is flawless.  Many have commented that the Corvette is little more than an over priced Camaro SS.  This couldn�t be further from the truth.  The C-5 Corvette is in a class by itself.
