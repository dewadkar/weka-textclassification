            After getting rid of my fianc�e&#146s unsafe dull feeling Toyota 2001 Corolla (see my review), my fianc�e decided it was time for something safer and better handling.  Specifically she wanted an SUV, but didn't want the negatives of an SUV like size, gas mileage, etc.  We quickly focused in on the mini SUV segment.  We looked at a Jeep Liberty, liked it, but found the gas mileage too low.  We then looked at a Ford Escape, but unfortunately after opening the driver&#146s side door, the car alarm went off in the showroom making quite a racket.  We sat there for a couple minutes while none of the sales people did anything, and then walked out of the dealership never to look at another Escape.  Next was the Honda CRV, but there was something about it that turned me off.  All the cutesy storage bins and cup holders were too much, and it felt like a minivan.  I didn't want a minivan, so we left without driving it.  And then came the Subarus.  I initially wanted to look at the Baja, since I think it is cool.  My fianc�e didn't think it was as cool as I did, so I suggested we look at a Forester.  As soon as she saw that huge sunroof she wanted one.  We never bothered to look at the RAV4 because my fianc�e didn't like the look of it, and it was based on the same chassis as our old Corolla that we didn't like.

On a dark and stormy night about 3 weeks later, we picked up our Aspen White 2003 Forester XS premium package with gray leather interior and automatic transmission.  Both of us felt immediately at home driving it.  My fianc�e insisted that she be the one who drive it home even though it was dark and stormy.  This was something she never would have done in her Corolla, because she felt so unsafe driving that car in rain or darkness.  At last she can finally drive around without being in constant fear of being in an accident.  To me this is the best feature of the car. 

Our Forester is a very nice vehicle.  It has a lot of amenities that are typically associated with luxury cars: heated leather seats, in dash 6 CD changer, outside temperature gauge, automatic climate control, and of course the huge moon roof.  This is what attracted us to the car the most.  The leather seats are very comfortable although we have yet to take a long trip so I can't comment on that.  I think they were worth the money, because I found the velour cloth seats they replace hard on my back.  I also did not the velour material.  The material in the base model seems better than the upgraded XS cloth.  The tan interior looks a lot better than the gray interior, but unfortunately we couldn't get it with a white car.

When we first got the Forester I drove it around in the rain and it drove great.  At first I thought the brights did not work, but quickly realized that I had only turned on the parking lights.  The daytime running lights made me think the lights were on.  The handling is excellent for a vehicle of this type.  It is not sports car, but it is decent enough in most driving conditions.  What I like is the fact that somehow Subaru managed to get the Forester to feel enough like an SUV yet still drive very car like.  The AWD drive worked well on the slick rain soaked roads around our house

I have not pushed the car too hard yet because we are still breaking it in, but the engine feels like it has plenty of power, unlike some reviews that said it did not.  What I like about the engine is that it is a boxer.  For those who don't know what a boxer engine is, it is an engine where the cylinders are horizontally opposed to one another instead of vertical (straight 4 or 6) or in a V configuration (like a V8).  This is the same type of engine that is used in Porches, old VWs, and BMW motorcycles.  The primary benefit of boxer engines are that the weight is lower to the ground, which lowers a vehicle's center of gravity for improved handling.  This is very beneficial for vehicles with high centers of gravity like SUVs, and in addition lowers the chance of a vehicle rollover.  One flaw with the engine is that it has heavy vibrations at idle, which can be felt in the seat.  The vibrations are not excessive, and do not seem out of character in the Forester.

Some people might consider the styling bland, but we think it looks handsome.  Color makes a huge difference in how this car shows.  Silver does not flatter the car, but most of the other colors are OK.  I liked the gold and red which get the tan interiors, but my fianc�e preferred white, which looks good too.  

Subaru offers a number of nice accessories, which we will add to our Forester when they come in (bumper guards, doggie gate, front end mask).  I found out afterwards that you could get these accessories cheaper online (http://www.allsubaru.com) than even dealer cost, which is what we got.  Sales are slow at present (12/02) and Subaru dealers are willing to let Foresters go for invoice with low interest financing.  We tried to find a car that had not sat on the lot long and had not been test driven.  Many of the Forresters we found had around 80 miles that means they had been test driven a few times, and some of the interiors seemed scratched up and dirty.  We were able to find exactly what we wanted, and our car was factory fresh with only 8 miles.  All in all the buying experience at our Subaru dealer was pretty painless.

Overall we are happy with our purchase and would recommend the Forester.  My fianc�e has regained her enthusiasm for driving again, and the daily stress from her commute is reduced.  This is our first Subaru, and I hope it will be as reliable as people say they are.  I'll update this review in a few months after we've lived with it for a while.

--6 month update!!! 6700 mi--
Well it has been 6 months since purchasing this vehicle and we are still happy with it.  We've taken it on several long trips, and it served us quite well on our wedding weekend.  My wife is still happy driving it, and says it is the best car she has ever owned.  The AWD is really nice when it rains. 

The car now has almost 7000 miles and seems to have loosened up quite a bit.  The engine vibrations that I complained about when we first bought the car have subsided quite a bit, and aren't noticeable most of the time.  I guess the engine mounts loosen up over time and reduce the overall vibration.  We have not had any problems so far and have only gone to the dealer for routine servicing.  Our dealer experience has been OK, but nothing to write home about.  I suppose that's good since nothing bad has happened.  I expect the car to be reliable for quite some time to come.  

OK now for some nit picking:
1.) The one component that seems the weakest is the automatic transmission.  What I have noticed is: very hard downshift shifting from first to second going about 5-10 MPH when the accelerator is punched.  There is a very noticeable clunk.  Slow upshift shifting from 2nd to 3rd under moderate acceleration.  It feels like the transmission will actually shift to neutral for almost a half second and the tach ill shoot up to almost 3000 RPM.  Both of these conditions are reproducible, and I think are due to the way the transmission is designed.  Most of the time the transmission shifts smoothly, and is in general adequate.
2.) The bumpers scratch very easily.  If you even tap someone's bumper in parallel parking you get a nasty gouge.  The nasty gouges bother my wife since the rest of our Forester is perfect.  I have noticed this on other Foresters as well.  Subaru does not offer a parking bumper guard, but they really should with bumpers this easy to scratch.
3.) The keyless entry sometimes requires multiple clicks to work.  The unlock button needs to be larger as well.
4.) The dog guard is imposing and difficult to remove when you need to haul cargo.  The is a large slot in it so that the middle back seat passenger can get the roof mounted shoulder belt.  It requires that two screws be fastened/unfastened each time it is removed/installed.  The top screws into the roof and seems kind of flimsy.  Subaru should spend some engineering money, and develop a better snap in mechanism for the dog guard, so that you wouldn't have to worry about losing screws.  Also if it was made a plastic instead of metal, you wouldn't have to worry about scratching the car up every time you took it out.
5.) The auto climate control system is sadistic.  When on auto control it is either blasting you with arctic air or roasting you with hot air to maintain temperature.  Not only that, but it turns the fan to the highest speed to do this.  Subaru needs to learn the word subtle and make this system work a little less obtrusively.  We just turn off the auto mode and use it manually.

Other than this car has been great to own.  We still love the leather seats and find them comfortable.  I am impressed with the amount of room in the back, and we compliments from everyone who rides back there.  The rubber cargo mat is a must have in this car.  It has saved the carpet from our dog and other dirty cargo.  The cargo net is also quite nice.  It holds though plastic grocery bags really well.  The front bra is also a worthwhile option.  It has saved our front bumper from the nasty gouges and looks cool when you are driving.  The in dash 6 CD player is nice as well.  The power and handling are quite good, although I wished I had waited for the turbo.  All in all this is a nice car and my previous recommendation still stands.

--12 month update!!! 18000 mi--
After 1 year we are still happy with our purchase.  The car seems to be holding up quite well, and we plan to hold on to it until the wheels fall off or 200K miles which ever comes first.

This car served us well in our wedding.  It held my wife's huge dress quite well.  We took a nice after wedding drive down the California coast and the car's pleasant demeanor helped us relax after the stressful event.

We use it all the time to pick up and move foster dogs.  I still don't care for the dog guard, but it is effective in keeping the dogs where they need to be.  The mount has come loose and can't be tightened, and rattles a lot in an otherwise tight car.  By all means be sure to get the rubber cargo mat, which has been enormously useful in keeping the back clean.

The Forester's hauling capability is pretty decent.  I have hauled cement, dirt, lumber, a wine barrel, an automobile transmission, and boxes all without issue.  The suspension seems beefy enough for light hauling.  The area where the cargo area falls short is in hauling long items.  Even with the seats folded down it is difficult to haul anything greater than 6'6".  This has been an issue a surprising number of times.  Also the Dog guards real pain to remove for hauling larger cargo.

The engine vibrations have smoothed out so that I only occasionally notice them.  Perhaps I have just gotten used to them, but they are much better than when new.

The boxer engine itself is nice and torquey.  I do wish for more power when merging on an expressway, but power is adequate in most cases.  I sure do lust after the turbo though.  That sounds like a blast to drive.  Maybe after a few years I can pick up a turbo and other engine parts for cheap, or drop in an STI engine.  In the mean time I'll keep lusting.  Gas mileage is around 23 with mixed driving.

All in all we have enjoyed having the Forester this past year, and it has fit in nicely to our lives.  We recommend the car without hesitation.  The only downside is that after consumer reports picked the Forester as the number one mini SUV we have been seeing them all over the place in Northern California, and I like to be somewhat distinct.  That doesn't make it any worse of a car though.
