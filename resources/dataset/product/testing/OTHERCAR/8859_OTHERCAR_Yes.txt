            Just last week I purchased a 2000 Accord EX-V6 and I am in love.  I would sleep in the car if I thought I wouldn't drool on the leather seats.  I traded in a 1997 Sunfire for the Accord.  What an upgrade!  I love that the only extras I had put on the car were the floor mats and splash guards.  Everything I could have wanted was standard.  Driving this car is so effortless.  It is smooth and quiet and wonderful.  I thought I would have a big adjustment to the size of the car, but that really hasn't been the case.  This is my first new foreign car (in college I had a used Toyota Tercel, which was sort of lemon-ish, but that's another story).  I went with the Accord because I don't want to buy another new car for a long time.  Ideally, I'd like to keep this about 7 years, but would be willing to go much longer than that.  I have a friend whose parents have had ths same Accord since 1984 and it is still in great shape and they've had little work done on it.  That is what I want.  I want a car that won't be in the shop all the time and I can drive until it can't drive anymore.  I think I've got it.

In the week I've had the car, I can't recommend it enough to people.  My favorite bonus feature?  Ok, two favorite features:  Automatic climate control and the integrated rear-window anetnna.  

Everyone should own a Honda<br><br>
