            Bottom line: This is such a fun car to drive. My RSX is still less than three weeks old and I almost have 900 miles on it. My car is the base model with leather and no extra options.

I loved the look of the exterior of the car. Very sleek and sporty on the outside and very comfortable on the inside. The rear lights are large, circular, and bright (looks like a Nissan Skyline from behind at night). The front headlights are also large, very bright and vastly improved from the Integra. The front underbody spoiler also looks very nice. 16 inch alloy wheels are standard. Front and rear intermittent windshield wipers are standard. Also comes with power sunroof and sunshade, and cruise control.

The interior is fabulous. The dashboard and gauges are bright red at night. It is visually stunning. The seats are racing-style, which means that there is no adjustable headrest, but the seat is very comfortable. It fits just right with my back and arms so I think anyone could find this comfortable. The temperature gauges are very unique looking (they are shaped like knobs). The sound system is AM/FM/CD standard with 6 speakers. I drive the automatic transmission which also comes with Sequential Sportshift which is an electronically controlled manual transmission. Switch it to "M" and you can shift up or down without the use of a clutch. There is also a very good amount of leg room for the driver and passenger. The back is decent for a sports car and has comparable leg room of a small sedan like a Toyota Corolla. The is not much headroom for tall people in the back though. And only two can fit in the back. The trunk is very roomy and the back seats can fold down for more space.

My RSX (Base model) has a 2.0 liter i-VTEC with 160 horsepower and 141 lbs/ft torque. So obviously it is powerful. The steering is very easy and the car responds and handles well. However, the car turns at a very wide angle so some sharp turns are difficult to make on one try. ABS is standard as are disc brakes so braking is very powerful. It accelerates well, 0-60 in about 8 seconds. Gas mileage is above average: 24 city/ 31 highway. Security system with ignition disable and keyless entry are also standard. The keys are also special in that they contain a special electronic circuit/code. If you don't use the factory key to start the car, the car will disable the fuel and will not allow the car to start. The radio also will not work if it is removed from the car.

As you've probably read so far, many features come standard on this car even though it is only the base model. The base without leather is around $20,000. Mine with leather was $20,700 after negotiating (before tax). There are only a few options available and the only one I got was a leather interior. Some other options that you can get are fog lights and rear spoiler. 

Ever since I laid my eyes on this car, I knew I wanted it, and finally I got it! It is also backed up by the quality and reliability of the Honda/Acura name. It is a powerful car and can accelerate very well. So when I go out, I have a ton of fun driving and blasting music with the windows and sunroof open. You will get many envious looks from being in this car!
