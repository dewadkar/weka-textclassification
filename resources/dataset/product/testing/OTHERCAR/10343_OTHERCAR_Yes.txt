            I bought a 2001 Toyota LE a week ago, and am amazed at how quickly I fell in love with this car.  It has a great sporty look for a 4 door.  The interior design seems well thought out with everything conveniently located on the dash and in reach of the driver.  I went for middle of the road options, not getting cruise control and remote door locks, instead purchasing the bumper to bumper 75,000 mile warranty.  I guess I'd rather unlock the door myself than pay for costly repairs later.
While the exterior is sporty to say the least, the interior is great.  It has remote trunk and gas filler door opening, a good sound system and great visibility.

The car is easy to drive (I got an automatic this time around), really peppy, small enough to park without an act of congress, and very comfortable.  It has a feature that I hadn't seen before, a 60/40 split rear seat back.  40% of the back seat can fold down enabling you to carry long loads extending into the passenger cabin from the trunk.  With the front passenger seat-back reclined you can get a really long load into this little car.  Gas mileage is really good, too.  It gets about 33 in town and 39 on the highway, which is a real selling point today.

In all, I haven't found it's bad habits yet, if it has any.  I'd recommend this car to just about anyone who is past the &quot;kid hot rodding around&quot; stage of life.  It is mid-priced and a great bargain.<br><br>
