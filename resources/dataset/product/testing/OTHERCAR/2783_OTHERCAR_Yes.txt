            I received the Olympus D-450 Zoom Digital Camera as a gift for Christmas back in '99.  Since then, it has been through everything I've been through - college, snowboarding, football games, etc.  It is very easy to use - it's not one of those cameras that you have to explain to people when you ask them to take your picture with it.  It's a &quot;common sense&quot; camera.  The digital features are a little bit more complex, and if you're just into taking pictures (which is why you bought a camera in the first place) then you really don't need a lot of the added extras.  The LCD screen on the back of the camera allows the user to preview the pictures that have been taken, and the camera provides the option of thumbnailing images for easier and faster viewing.  The camera comes with computer software that can be used for quick downloading and editing of pictures.  Unfortunately, there are several drawbacks to this photography machine.  First, since it is a digital camera, it tends to run through size AA batteries like they're not even there.  Apparently, this is a problem that strikes most digital cameras.  The best and smartest solution to this problem is to pick up rechargeable batteries and exclusively use them.  There's no point in throwing more money at Duracells and Energizers than is necessary.  Another gripe is the annoying consistency of &quot;red-eye&quot; in the pictures taken by the camera.  You'll spend a lot of time making sure the people in your pictures don't look like they're possessed, but if you have a program like Microsoft's Picture It! program, it won't take very long to make the picture look great.  The last complaint I have about the camera is in regards to previewing pictures on the LCD screen - the lens to the camera cannot be open and the LCD screen cannot be on if you want to see the picture you just took.  You have to power it down and then turn the screen on in the back.  Other than those three complaints, the camera has turned out to be a great addition to my electronics collection.  The quality of the pictures it takes are simply amazing when compared to those taken by other normal cameras, and its durability under stress has been proven.  If you want a good, solid camera that will take high quality pictures, this one may be right up your alley.<br><br>
