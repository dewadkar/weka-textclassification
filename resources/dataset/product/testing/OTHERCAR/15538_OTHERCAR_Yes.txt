            Okay, I'll admit it - I just turned 40.  But with that aside, I bought a used 1999 Sebring JXI this Spring with many thoughtful considerations in mind.

First) I wanted a four-seater so I fit my daughter, niece, and nephew in while I cruised around town - fat and happy.  No Miata or B'mer could do that trick.

Second) The styling of the Sebring is handsome, and (I believe time will tell) classic.  It's a perfect mix of brute meets playboy, and when the top's down and the boot is on (covering the folded top) - I feel like I'm driving a land speedboat! 

Third) The features that came standard on my JXI were exceptional as well.  Everything is power; windows, locks, top, driver's seat, side-view mirrors.  It has a trip computer, and built-in compass that actually works. And finally...it has a great keyless-entry remote with trunk access and panic button.

Fourth) Like I said, I'm 40 now - so it's expected of me to get a convertible.  And besides that - my daughter loves it!

After six months of use, I feel I can assess the cars pros and cons quite well - as follows:

Pros:  Handles well, pretty good pick-up, solid feel, good instruments, very comfortable, overall good cabin space.  And very important to us Northerners, nice and quiet with the top and windows up.

Cons:  Switches and controls are better than the older Chryslers, but not even in the same league as Honda's.  The top-of-the-line JXI should have climate control, but doesn't.  And if the back-end could be as righteous as the front-end...well that would be pretty much impossible.

If you're turning 40, but don't want to drop 40 grand for some fun transportation - this might be your baby.  So put the top down, and toss your hair-piece in the glovebox.  Enjoy the asphalt boating!!!<br><br>
