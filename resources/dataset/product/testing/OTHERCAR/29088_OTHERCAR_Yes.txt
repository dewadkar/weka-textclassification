            Having driven a Jeep for the past 6 years and having it fall apart after just 60,000 miles I decided to go for the king of the SUV's.  Since most SUV's of this class ($35,000+) are comparable in automotive technology, I focused mostly on passenger room, cargo room, and the cost of insurance.  Believe it or not the Rover is the least expensive SUV to insure in New York City.  $2,200 per year vs. $6,000 per year for a BMW SUV.  The cargo room is the largest of the luxury SUV's, and passenger comfort is enhanced by the hydraulics that lower the car to make it easier to get in and out of.  A great feature for someone like me who is 5'4" and my elderly in-laws, and much better than those ugly running boards.  Besides, how glamorous can you look dressed in formal attire hopping down from a running board.

The Rover is a rouge car and this winter I got to see what it was made of.  Just before New Year's Eve we had a blizzard.  I had hotel reservations and wanted to make it to the hotel.  I hopped in Rover and drove down to Atlantic City on snow covered streets, smiling at the cars who slid off the road.  The traction is amazing, mostly due to its weight and partly to its traction control.

The only disappointments that I have in the car are the fuel mileage, which I already knew about and decided that if I made the plunge for the "king of the SUV's" than the extra $300 or so for gas wouldn't be too bad. I also have little quality issues that should be better.  Things like the glove compartment has a tear along the edge, the rear ash tray keeps opening, the front ashtray won't open and the side passenger mirror has three positions but the 3rd position, the position were the mirror is fully extended, is useless because if you fully extend the mirror than you can't see the traffic along side of you.  However, all of these things have been taken care of by the dealer and are now all right; except the mirror which I consider a design flaw.

All in all my rover has lived up to everything that I had hoped it would be. 

To those who knock the Range Rover, this vehicle is not meant for the city hopping mom who needs to shuffle in and out of traffic.  It is a tough truck and was designed to be an off road vehicle.  It was turned into a luxury car by the U.S. market like the Hummer.  If you are not prepared to accept the city limitations of the Rover, than don't buy it.
