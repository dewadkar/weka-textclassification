            Ok, so i'm in the market for a used car. I've been working for 2 years and I'm buying it myself. I decide I want a small sports car. So I search, and I search, and after several incidents involving bad finds, i finally hit the cherry. I find her sitting there, waiting for me. The dealer uses the Remote Start to Start her up, and then it smacked me in the face, the most beautiful sound i've ever heard. I sat in it, with my arm out the window looking at the sky through the t-tops "I could definantly deal with this." And so i got her. Worried as are all Used car buyers that something would go wrong, i prayed i would luck out. And so far I have. Not one problem, had the car for about 5 months now. This thing is absolutely gorgeous, V8 275 hp, t-tops, teal, automatic. The car is a dream come true. When i get out of it, i stare at amazement, that she's all mine. Stick with the American car, it's fast, mean looking, sounds great, and rides like a dream. And for all of you that say this car is not for a crazy teen, your right, this much power needs to be handled responsibly, and if handled correctly this car is a teen's dream come true.
