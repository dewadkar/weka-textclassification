            The Kodak DC-240 was my first (and to date only) digital camera. I don't have another product to compare this to as it was my first exposure (no pun intended :-) to a digital camera. I have found the camera very easy to operate and understand so I would recommend it for beginners like myself. I like the zoom lens as I sell small items online and the zoom lens allows me to get close up shots for detail. The software that came with the camera package is very easy to install and operate as well. The camera package also included 4 rechargeable batteries, a battery charger and 4 non-rechargeable batteries. I bought the AC Power Adapter separately and that allows me to take pictures of items to be displayed online and it saves on batteries. I did a lot of research prior to buying this camera and once I made a decision, I price compared and got an excellent deal at the time. Some web stores were asking $150 more than I paid for the same camera. I recommend you shop around for best pricing before buying as it can save a substantial amount of money. Thank you for reading this. <br><br>
