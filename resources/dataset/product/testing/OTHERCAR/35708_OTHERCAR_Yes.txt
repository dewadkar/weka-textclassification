             Hello, I noticed that no one has written opinions about the 90's VW GTI, let alone the very rare 16V model of 91-92. 
 I have had my car for apprx 11mos now &amp; have (mostly) enjoyed every minute. The car currently has 119k miles. I will recap why the VW GTI 16V.
 
 +LOOKS: I have always loved the uncluttered, purposeful, &amp; not overly &quot;trying too hard&quot; styling. The early 90's models are &quot;no exception&quot;.  
    The European 4 round headlight grille looks classy &amp; very sporty, but not in the &quot;show off&quot; Camaro/Trans AM type a way. There is standard foglamps &amp; the classic molded GTI fender flares (only down side is keeping the plastic from fading). The 16V model gets the added detail of wider front fender wells that give it a mean aggressive stance, but again &quot;tastefully&quot;. 
     Also unique to the 16V model is standard, &amp; very pretty (but fragile) 15&quot; BBS 2 piece wheels. Commonly you will notice the &quot;not so common&quot; 16V, baring aftermarket wheels. This is because there was a great deal damaged from road imperfections, w/ the lack of sidewall on the low profile 50 series tires. The GTI I purchased had less desirable TSW Stealths, but it still looks fantastic. 
 
  +INTERIOR: This is also an area that excels over other cars in my experience. 1st of all, genuine Recaro front seats, these are absolutely the most comfortable &amp; supportive standard seats I have ever had the pleasure to sit in. Gauges are no-nonsense, almost to the point of no style, &amp; easy to read. The car also has the common to many A2 GTI models, a simple column stock operated push button trip computer. At the touch of a button you can get average fuel economy (av. city is 22mpg for me), miles traveled, av. speed, outside temperature, &amp; time travelled.  Very cool to keep you entertained on rd trips or to alert to your friends why Gilroy is feeling so much hotter than Monterey was. 
   
     Another thing I really like about these cars is that they have what I feel I &quot;NEED&quot;, not a large multitude of electronics, (unfortunately I cannot get a &quot;new VW&quot; w/ this type of philosophy). 
   
     There is no power windows, no electronic climate controls, no heated seats, no power locks, no extra things to fix when they break (being a VW you may not want a large dose of &quot;electronics&quot;). 
   
     There is a manual sunroof, w/ out complicated power controls for a moonroof that you can position every which way imaginable,....you just unwind it &amp; enjoy the sun, &amp; fresh air.
   
      The rear seat collapses to a truck like cavern. Added feature of the 16V model is a split fold, though this was a common feature of all earlier 86-90 GTI'S despite 8V or 16V, like the trip computer. 
      5 people can actually sit comfortably in this car, &amp; it has seatbelts for them all. There is a handy center console to keep your day planner in, sunglasses, or loose cassettes. There is lots of headroom as well. A friend of mine is 6'4 &amp; sits comfortably behind the wheel of his A2 16V. 
    
  +RIDE &amp; HANDLING: Awwww, the beauty of VW. It rides comfortable, yet communicative. The steering has exc response &amp; feel of the road. The car is easy in the turns. I have wound around freeway entrances @ amazing speeds while the inside rear wheel does the trademark lifting in the air, w/ out upsetting the car's composure. The car is exceptionally nimble in the moment of an emergency, easy to control in one of those not so safe &amp; unplanned events on the road. Pure balance comes to mind w/ the GTI &amp; it can only be improved w/ the large amount of aftermarket accesories available. Anything from shocks &amp; struts, swaybars, strut tower bars, etc can be purchased to enhance the cars handling further. The only mod my car has is the front Neuspeed strut tower bar, avail for $80 from most aftermarket suppliers, &amp; takes only 30 minutes to install w/ a drill &amp; some household tools. This helps keep the car from flexing in turns, &amp; I do notice a difference. Otherwise I am pretty happy w/ the factory set up &amp; intend to only upgrade as the shocks begin to show sign of needing replacing. At that point I will research what is the best set up.
     
  +DRIVETRAIN: The 16V is like driving an F1 racer. You want to keep winding that 16V 2 liter to see what it can do. You can also comfortably track @ 2000 rpm all day w/ out a problem. It is a rare occasion when you drive a 16V out of say, a Japanese car, w/ the torque down low where you can &quot;use it&quot;. The motor make great sounds as well. When you stand on it @ 5mph, it emits a throaty low growl. 
      The shifter, like most Vdubs is not the most user friendly. The throws are long, &amp; it is a bit notchy...but awww hawww!!, there is an answer :), get a $100 shift kit from Neuspeed &amp; it completely tranforms the feel of the shifter, &amp; makes the throws very short. Highly rec adapting your car to this feature. It will take a person w/ minimal mechanical ability 1 1/2 hrs to install. 
      The 4 wheel disc brakes are a joy. Not too sensitive, just the right amount of feel, &amp; stop on a dime. This is without the costly to repair ABS involved. I know the Jetta GLI was avail w/ it, but I am honestly glad that the GTI does not have the added complication of ABS, &amp; I am happy w/ the brakes &quot;as is&quot;.
       
    -COST OF PARTS &amp; ELECTRICAL ISSUES:  Now w/ all the positives, there has to come some negatives. I can say this w/ any car I have owned. As most reviewers will agree, &quot;parts are not cheap&quot;. This is especially bothersome to me as the orig thought that comes to mind is the company who brought us the Beetle. 
     The prices for parts are not in that territory. But then again not much has gone wrong. For instance the valve cover gasket is &quot;special&quot; on the 16V, &amp; costs $44!! Spark Plug wires on the 16V?... $130!! 
     Also it is said that it is important to ONLY use VW specific lubricants in the power steering ($14 a canister), &amp; the brakes. 
     I recently put Valvoline tranny fluid replacing the orig fluid w/ 40k miles since the rebuild @ 88k, &amp; found this makes a difference in how smooth it shifts. VW rec changing tranny fluid every 2 yrs, &amp; I can feel the difference. 
     Also the car does suffer electrical bugs. Minor, but annoying. The wiper motor has recently failed. I will likely pull one out of a wrecked car as I dont even want to know what the factory would charge for one! 
   Though, then again, I use Rain X &amp; never usually turn my wipers on.   
   Also my ground wire needs to be replaced, &amp; this has been a common VW issue for some time. Other common VW issues are waterpumps, fuel pumps, CV joints, heat shield on the exhaust, cooling system, motor mounts, &amp; a tranny that sometimes likes to self-destruct w/ time. But remember, if you dont beat up the tranny (&amp; change the fluid), it should last just fine, &amp; not cost you $1000+ in repairs to fix. 
   Also the distributors are costly &amp; commonly go in the 16V's. I had my seal replaced on mine though, &amp; it wasnt too bad @ $150 to repair. (Would have been $300+ for a &quot;new &quot; one)
   
   CONCLUSION: Otherwise these minor things aside,&amp; insurance that is a bit hefty, they are terrific cars w/ a character unfound in a Nissan, Toyota, or Honda. I have driven Acura Integras, Nissan Sentra SER'S of every generation (though I prefer the &quot;1st&quot; ones 91-93:), &amp; Multi Valve 90's Escort GTS. There is simply no substitute for the real thing. 
   
  (Though I like other cars, I even love my goofy 87 Chevy Sprint Turbo w/ an intercooled 3-cyl. If you want to check out my epinion on that one, it is under &quot;87 Chevy Sprint&quot;.) 
    
   RARE: Another added bonus is that of &quot;rarity&quot;. I was told by several dealers that they had only received 1-2 16V GTI a month for the 91-92 models. One VW rep stated only 2300 or less were imported into Calif. 
     
   Besides that, a GTI is timeless, &amp; despite what model or yr they are, they will always be cool &amp; accepted. If I would have chosen an Acura, it would have lost it's initial appeal, &amp; send me adrift looking into other more interesting cars within 6 months of purchase.  

  This car has a lot of potential for being a collectors item, &amp; unlike a G60 Corrado (a car where the windshield alone can cost $500), 90% of the body parts &amp; mechanicals are interchangeable w/ other Jettas, Golfs, etc of the generation. 
  So there will be little need to join a GTI 16V club in the future to get hard to find parts. 
  Balance...
