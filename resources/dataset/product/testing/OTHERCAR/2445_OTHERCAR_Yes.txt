            <b>The 2001 Toyota Tacoma Double Cab </b>is the answer to many families with great hauling needs.  In fact, not only will it haul your RV, but it will also haul at least 3 adult-size passengers in the cab.  <i>Equipped with 190-hp 3.4-liter double-overhead-cam V6, four-speed ECT automatic transmission, </i>it can tow up to a 5,000-pound trailer to whatever destinations of your choice.  While a lot of potential buyers may complain about its short bed, it compensates in far many ways this deficiency.  First of all, you have the double cab for your passengers, then you have all the extra features that you would find in a luxury car.

<b>Protection features besides hauling performance</b>

If you have been reading some of my recent automotive reviews, you will realize that I rank high the new generation of vehicles that come equipped with protective gear.  From head-restraint to air bag features, I tend to review and recommend these types of vehicles.  You may be asking why I am so gong-ho about protection features.  Well, they can save lives.  They did save my family's lives.  The 2001 Toyota Tacoma has a driver's side air bag, a passenger's side air bag and side impact beams to protect lives in potentially fatal side collisions.  You may sometimes drive a crash site and start wondering whether there is any survivor or not.  These new devices found in newer vehicles do save lives.  Enough of this now!  For a small truck, its towing capacity is well-known.  In some of the mission trips I have been on in the Caribbean Basin and some Central American countries, I had the privilege to observe how much cargo these Tacomas can carry.  It's a "I am not leaving anyone and anything behind" type of mentality for many of the local drivers.  Sometimes, four passengers can be squeeshed in the back while the short bed is packed with materials and personal belongings. The map pockets and cargo hooks come handy in the back country.  Instead of having to stop at convenience stores or bodegas to ask for directions, you will be able to drive right to your final destinations.  

<i>The 2001 Toyota Tacoma Double Cab 4WD</i> comes equiped with all the standard features such as A/C, tinted glass, power disc, brakes etc.  If you are on the market for a reliable little truck that you can easily park in most parking lots without having to worry about the bed sticking out there, the Double Cab is the right vehicle for you. Bear in mind that the Toyota Tacoma is available in these models:  Regular Cab, XTRACAB or Double Cab, 4WD Double CAB or 2WD XTRA Cab S-Runner.  Now I must also add that the 2001 Toyota Tacoma Double Cab 4WD has some potent competitors in mostly the Chevy S-10 Crew Cab.  It's available only in 4WD.  Some industry insiders and owners state it's able to tow a 5,200-pound trailer.  Beyond the Chevy S-10, the 2001 Toyota Tacoma Double Cab holds its own value out there. Owning one is a long-term investment which you reap many advantages from.

<b>Whom can you picture being behind the wheels of this Double Cab?</b>

First things first, I can picture myself being its owner some day.  It will meet my family and business needs.  I will be able to have the luxury, comfort and convenience of a vehicle I can use to haul stuff, my kids and work-related activities.  In addition, I can see some lifestyle-conscious teenagers going all for one 2001 Toyota Tacoma Double Cab to drive to school and show off to his many female friends.  With the right set of tires, they can have the security of being in control of a little monster on the road.  This teenager will be attracted not only by the looks but also by the power of the Tacoma.

<b>Who else can drive this double cab?</b>

Any retired person who is thinking about doing some traveling all over the country can bet on the reliability and multi-functions offered by the Toyota family.  Any working mom with 1.5 kids can take advantage of this truck.  It will be very appropriate for family travels.  Everybody can haul something somewhere with lots of ease and class.
