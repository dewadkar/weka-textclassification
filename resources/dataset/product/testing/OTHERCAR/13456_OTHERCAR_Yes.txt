            Going from a 1994 Saturn to a 1990 Topaz took a little getting used to but it was well worth the effort. My husband and I bought this car in Mississippi and have not regretted it at all.

Granted there is a little additional maitenance for an older car, but we've been lucky with nothing large being wrong with it.

The car overall is very nice, granted it could use a new paint job but other than that it's worked out great. The backseat is roomy enough for a carseat and 2 middle sized people. As many of you know from chatting with me, I'm over 6' tall and not very small. My husband is 6'2" and large. SO for a normal family or person this is the ideal car. We fit in it but just barely.

The Topaz currently is being driven 100 miles a day for my husbands job and has held up under this condition for over a year now. We trust this car and have not been let down by that trust either.

Overall this has been a great little car to get us by. We are looking for another car now just so that we can have one for each of us.
