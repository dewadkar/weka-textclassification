            I bought my 2000 Durango in September '99.  I've had a couple SUV vehicles prior to my Durango - '95 Toyota 4-Runner and '92 Ford Bronco.  The Toyota was nice, a gut-less wonder but nice, a little on the small side too.  The Bronco was great for roominess but terrible road handling -especially driving down winding roads in the mountain, very unstable.

I love my Durango because it gives me everything I want, sporty look, plenty of room for the family and extras, and a strong engine to pull our boat up steep mountain grades.  I've heard some people complain about the gas mileage, but my Durango gets the same gas mileage that my wimpy 4-runner got, so I have no complaints in that respect.  Anyone who owns an SUV must expect to purchase more gas - so if you want fuel economy buy a car.

The Durango's drive is smooth, the leather interior is gorgeous, with the third seat option I can safely separate the kids when the &quot;Mom she's touching me&quot; game starts(e.g., they still have their seat belts on at all times).  When I need to pick up a dresser or other large item converting the seats to a large cargo area is a snap!  My husband and I have even slept in the back of the Durango (cargo area) when our &quot;camping under the stars&quot; got rained out.  The fact that both back seats fold down flat is a huge benefit that others SUVs can't offer.  Another thing I love is the turning radius of the Durango.  It turns on a dime, far far better than either my 4-Runner or Bronco.  To sum it all up, after owning my Durango for a year and a half, I love it just as much as the day I picked it up. I can honestly say that I wouldn't consider owning any other SUV. 

Anyone who wants a sporty, powerful, smooth driving, user-friendly, boat/camper-hauling, kid packing machine should seriously consider the Durango.  This is one camping, boating, hiking, kid chauffeuring mom that would recommend this car to anyone - no doubt about it!<br><br>
