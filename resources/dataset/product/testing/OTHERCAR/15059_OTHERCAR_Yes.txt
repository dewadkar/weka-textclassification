            The Sony Mavica FD-73 is a great digital camera for those interested in adding photos to websites or emails.  The resolution is plenty good for those applications. I have taken over 2000 photos with mine and the only complaint I have is that I wish it had a manual focus capability, which IS available on the more expensive models of the Mavica.  This product is very good for those who just want to view them on the computer or share them on electronic media.....Don't plan on printing them with any success.  The floppy disk memory media is great, it is easy to use and quite durable.<br><br>
