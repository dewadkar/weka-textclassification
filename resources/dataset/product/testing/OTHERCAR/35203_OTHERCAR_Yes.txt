            We purchased a 1999 Toyota 4Runner new in '99. We got the Limited because we had to make it pretty for my wife. I am overall pleased with the car. As usual it had to be "approved" by my son who was the one to recommended it. This replaced our minivan because the kids were are more grown and some driving, so we didn't need it to cart a lot of them around but we still needed something that we could toss a bunch of sports stuff or just general junk in the back of. We thought that a sport ute would be the best option, and we got the 4Runner because it is smaller than some and easier for my wife to handle. The limited package is nice, it comes with the gold lettering on the car, leather, CD, sunroof, and the encased bumpers...which I don't like. The bumpers are covered with this plastic shell that makes the 4Runner look more urban. I wanted the steel bumpers but the wife got her way.

   My wife is totally happy with it. She loves the keyless remote option that lets you roll down the window on the rear hatch. The window is also nice when we take our chocolate lab places, he likes to hang ot the back. I find myself driving the 4Runner often and I it fun. I usually drive a car but there is something rewarding and domineering about driving a sport ute, it's not quite the tahoe I used to have way back but it is nice. The V6 engine isnt quite the power I wanted in it, but now that they have the V8 for the Landcruiser, Tundra, and Sequoia maybe they'll put one in the 4Runner. The front is a little bit small as far as palces to put things, but for driver comfort it is nice. We use it for towing our new ski boat, a Glastron GX 185...and it works great. It is comfortable for long car trips. I like the climate control because it has the degrees instead of the red-blue lines...you get to set teh exact temperature. According to my son the stereo system is "decent, but could use some subs". I also enjoy the windows feature that lets you just touch the button once and it will go all the way down or up, and it is like that for the driver and front seat passenger. 

  I also use it for hunting and doing odd jobs around the cottage, and it's a pretty rugged vehicle. In the winter the 4 wheel drive is nice, and it handles nicely in bad weather. We also put a trunk liner in it and winter rug covers for teh drver and front seat passenger. We leave the trunk liner in all the time. So I am totally satisfied with it and glad that I bought it. Like all SUVs it eats gas like crazy.
