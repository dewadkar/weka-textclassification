            I received this product as a gift from my father when my daughter was born. I find it to be easy to use, both in the taking of pictures and uploading. I also like that it can use regular AA batteries, not just the rechargeable ones it came with.

The pictures I have takes have come out excellent, at times better than my regular 35mm camera. I have had some of the pictures printed by Kodak.com, and I am quite impressed.

I highly recommend this for anyone who has children, especially those with relatives that have e-mail. It is so much easier to take pictures with this camera and e-mail the pictures than to get numerous copies made from prints. And it's cheaper in the long run.<br><br>
