            I bought my 1991 Corsica in 1999.  When i bought it, it only had 54,000 miles on it.  That's one of the main reasons i bought it.  The other being that the car i had, 1986 Ford Escort, blowed goats.  

My Corsica has the awesome 3.1 liter, V6 engine.  I love this engine.  Compared to other companies V6's, i would say this is the best.  I can get from 0-50 in an intersection.  And even if the engine was that great, the rest of the car is totally kicking.  The factory system that it has, has to be the best factory set i have ever heard.  All of my friends went and bought brand new Sony and Poineer stereo systems, (no subs) and my factory system is still clearer and louder than theirs.  The interior is also very roomy.  The bucket seats are the absolutely most comfortable things i have ever driven in.  I have almost every option available except power windows and power seats (if they were even available than).  The power locks are awesome, the cruise control is a great gas saver in this vehicle (especially with my lead foot).   The only thing i don't like about this car is the rarity of the center pieces and the high cost to replace them.  I have all four of mine.  


Corsicas also are very durable.  I have hit a fire hydrant and slid under a truck, and drove the car home on both occasions.
