            I bought this car in 2001, it's a 1992 Caprice fully loaded, it burns gas like mad, the whole exhaust system fell off, everything except the headers. The only good part was it only cost me 110$ CDN to replace everything. Rust is showing up everywhere, i'm having a hard time keeping up with it. The car drives exactly like a boat, the grip on the road is not bad, but since the seats have such a poor design you slide with the car, I have to hang on to something when driving. I would say the car is very reliable, I have not had any major problems that required fixing, except, I overlooked a dead spark plug, and evetually the seals wore of on that cylinder, now it sucks oil like mad, coolant seems to evaporate. This car is the most terible car to drive. I never once got a comment on how well it looks, the whole interior is falling apart, it's hard to keep up with it. Because of this car I will never buy another big car again. Smaller is better. I'm glad only of one thing, I bought this car because I drive too fast, I drive very well, but fast, I have so many tickets that when I see cops it gives me shivers, and since I got this car, I drive slower, no cops have bugged me ever since I got it, in it's own way it has been a good luck charm, I will only keep it for another year, just until my record is clean, after that I don't care if it falls of a bridge. 

For a car so big it has so little room, at highway speeds you have to keep your distance because this beast does not wan't to stop, acceleration is terible, the tranny changes gears at the worst times.
