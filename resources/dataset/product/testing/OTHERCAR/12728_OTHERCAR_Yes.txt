Overview:
This vehicle was to replace our trusty Ford Windstar that was getting up in mileage. We contemplated another minivan, but we figured an SUV with a 3rd seat (seating for 7) would be a better option.  The Rendezvous always caught our eye, but with GM's 0% financing for 5yrs, it pushed us to purchase it. 

Ride:
This vehicle is fun to drive.  Nothing flashy about acceleration (only about 185 HP), but when asked to move, it will move. So going to highway speeds is never an issue.  Ride is just short of firm, but very comfortable and predictable.  This winter in the Northeast, we have already been blessed with plenty of snow (so I like skiing).  I was excited to see how this AWD drive vehicle behaved and was not disappointed.  Standing starts on a snow-filled street on a hill was excellent, easily starting up without a hint of spinning wheels.   The Rendezvous AWD traction system engages only the front wheels until it detects some slippage, then the rear wheels engage.  Whatever the case, going through the snow was easy and sure.  Driving the Rendezvous to the White Mountains in a middle of a blizzard was actually fun since no slipping and sliding occurred. (I do remember that AWD vs FWD vehicles both stop the same way, thus I was not like your occasional nut going 60 MPH in the blizzard).  

    On nice sunny days, the Rendezvous was equally pleasurable.  Steering firm, reasonable pick up and not to much of a bounce on a rough road.  One thing that was a minor nuisence is driving on a long uphill grade and maintaining highway speeds.  The Rendezvous needed to downshift a little too eagerly which affirmed to me GM could have put a little bigger HP engine but again, that is a minor point.  
City Mileage is about 13 MPG, Highway we got 22.  Based on the EPA estimate of 18 MPG city/ 24 MPG highway, I was a little disappointed about city mileage.  I would have expected 15 in the city for a V6.  Parking is relatively easy, having a nice turning radius and using the optional Parking Assist (Its a ultrasonic detection system thing mounted on the rear bumper). The high rear window view makes it tough to see directly behind you so the parking assist works well to keep you from hitting something when you are backing up.  The Parking Assist I would believe should be a must. Tilt side mirror when placing in reverse also is a very nice feature when parking close to the curb.  

Factory Quality:
We did have a small problem with vibration in the vehicle when going ~ 40 to 55 MPH on a smooth road.  The dealership tried balancing the tires but to no improvement.  Buick dealership has ordered 4 new tires from the factory to correct the problem which they suspect is in a defective tire.(4/03, dealership replaced the 4 tires and problem went away.  It took 3 months for them to get the tires.  You would think GM would do better).  The other minor problem was a defective outdoor thermometer sensor which always measured 32F even on a warm day.  This was corrected by the dealership by replacing the thermometer sensor.  Everything else was perfect.

Interior:  The leather was definitely the choice.  The other choices (cloth and cloth with leather sides) looked a bit cheap, and the heated seats are definitely worth it.  There is a bit more plastic adorning the interior, but it is well  sculpted thus not a big issue for the eyes to see.  The 3rd rear seat is easy to fold so adding 2 passengers in the rear is a piece of cake.  Myself being a 6 footer, I found to have plenty of room in the 3rd row.  Maybe on a 2 hr trip it might be a little tight but for 1/2 hr, it would be a piece of cake.  The 2nd row seats slide forward to give the extra leg room to the 3rd row. I was able to fold the 2nd row seat forward by myself while sitting in the 3rd row, and still open the door and exit. The only thing Buick could have done was make the 3rd seat a 50-50 split for versatility. It should be noted that with the 3rd seat up, there is about 1 ft of space between rear hatch and back of the seat, so bring 7 persons on a weekend trip won't do unless you use a car carrier and store luggage on the roof.
 
Ergonomics in the front is excellent.  The heads up display is actually quite useful in keeping me within the speed limits.  I thought it was more of a gimmick at 1st, but now find it very practical.  Controls for the radio is on the steering wheel, and shows up on the heads up display as you change channels, thus keeping your eyes forward at all times. The Dual Climate control works great since now I don't fight with my wife on being too cold on her side.  There is a rear vent in the 2nd row, but the heat doesn't get there with force so it take a little while heating the rear.  (It just may be operator error since there are many modes for the climate control).  The power seats have memory for two drivers and its setting is activated based on the remote used to open the door.  Myself being a 6 footer and my wife at 5ft 2in, I had a lot of jammed knees in the past getting into the car after she's last driven it.  Not anymore, since we have our own automatic seating arrangement (not to mention its tied into mirrors and radio station selection too).  Storage with the 3rd seat down is excellent.  Take the 2nd row seats out and its down right HUGH. 
    There is plenty of storage under the center console armrest for CDs, and various gadgets you want to hide from the outside world.  The cup holders placement is fine.  Two are located up front, 2 in the second row and 2 in the 3rd row.  The second row holder is a hidaway type that folds in the middle seat.  I may be concerned if someone is careless and leans into it the wrong way, since the plastic is not as robust as I believe  it should be , but time will tell if my kids destroy it or not.  


Note: One financial disappointment is Buick's integration of local and national advertising fee in the invoice ($600 total).  That could not be negotiated out due to either the negotiator's ineptitude, or the great financing deal (0% for 5 yrs) which made the dealer stand firm.  Regardless,with the financing, the vehicle has great value.
