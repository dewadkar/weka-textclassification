            The new 2002 Q45 is breathtaking.  One gaze causes you to stare endlessly at the car and yearn to buy one.  Now if you're in the market for a luxury sedan, you've come to the right place.  Infiniti offers excellent service and makes great cars.  If you didn't know already, Infiniti is the luxury end of Nissan.  You may be trying to decide whether to get the 2001 or 2002 model of the Q45.  Well, the 2002 model is totally updated.  The only common feature in its sibling is its length.  Enough talk about history and background, let's get to the bulk of the review.

The Q45 only has one model.  This makes it easier for you.  You don't have to decide which options come with what model.  However, the Q45 is the flagship (top of the line) car of Infiniti.  That's why it carries such a hefty price tag.

The Q45 has a 4.5 liter V8 engine with 340 hp!  This gives the luxury sedan a surprising amount of speed.  Infiniti says the car can rocket from 0-60 in 5.9 seconds.  The new Q also is wider and taller.  One feature you notice when gazing at the car is its technologically advanced headlights.  The headlights feature two 7-lens pods that emit a high intensity beam.  The Q also offers 17" wheels (optional 18" are also available).  The styling is very advanced, also.  Most objects in the car are rounded and very easily seen.  The dash has very readable gauges and has many features.

The new Q offers many standard features.  Other than air conditioning and the other normal standard features, there are greater standard features in the car.  One feature is RWD transmission with a 32 valve 320 hp V8 engine.  Other features include a 21.4 gallon gas tank, garage door opener, Bose audio system with 6 disc changer, Voice recognition, vehicle recognition with screen, and leather seats.

If the standard features do not satisfy your craving in a car then there are some optional packages.  Options include a navigation system, Premium package (includes Navigation and Sun shade package), sport package, heated front seats, and sun shade package.
