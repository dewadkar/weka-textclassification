            After my car was recently stolen (Acura 1993), I decided to look at a variety of cars of all sizes and shapes.  Amongst the other cars I looked at (Jetta, TL, Passat, BMW, Audi), the Accord was on the list.  Granted it's the King of the Purple Panda World, but I didn't have much choice.  After researching it further, I can see why every other car on the road is an Accord.
          
Our family has owned 3 Acura's over the last 10 years (90 Legend, 93 Legend, 2000 TL).  We have been continuosly impressed with Honda engineering, high fit & finish quality, and incredible value.  The EX-V6 Accord seems more than willing to continue this traditional.
          
Our Acura's has great engineering, and the big question was whether the Honda Accord would match my previous expectations.  I test drove the Accord, and I was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, the engine pumps out 200 hp.  This is more than sufficient given the weight of this car.  In fact, my 93 Legend had 200 hp and was much heavier.  Needless to say, acceleration was no problem in this car.  I also expected a weak suspension and so-so handling because the Accord is a family sedan.  I must admit that it doesn't do much to stir your soul, but it really isn't as bland and boring as you would expect.  It handles well and there is limited body roll.  It feels relatively light and nimble given its size on curves, but maintains a solid feel on the highway.  The steering is over-powered and I felt is was a bit too light.  I tend to prefer less power-assist so I have better control of the car, but this is my personal preference.  Others would probably appreciate this aspect.  

The car is also quite roomy and will easily fit 4 and can fit 5 people without much problem.  The trunk size is great as well.  The front seat are comfortable, but not exceptional.  The rear bench looks like it would be fine for a ride around the city, but it doesn't seem inviting for long trips.  Still, everyone has ample head and leg room in the front and back.
          
Being used to the Acura's, I was expecting a big downgrade in terms of the fit and finish.  However, by merely opening the doors, I saw I was completely wrong.  This car, is essentially made from TL parts.  Many of the modules were IDENTICAL.  For example, the home transmitter/sunglass cases, the windows, 
steering wheel, etc... is right out of the TL.  These parts looks good on the TL, and getting them in the price of an Accord is a steal. The buttons seem to be high quality and are incredibly functional.  If these parts as like their older parts (they look the same), then they will hold up without breaking for many years.
          
The style of the car is the next important aspect that I was considering, and to be honest, this was the Accord's biggest downfall.  I realize that styling issues are highly personable, and I'm just giving my opinions about this topic.  The exterior styling is just as you would expect from Honda... very conservative.  While I think that it looks good, it's not going to turn any heads.  This car has ZERO sex appeal.  Inside, the Accord was slightly less pleasing to me.  It buttons are all in an incredibly functional layout.  It seems that the Honda designers just took pages out of their old cars, and pieced then together here.  I'm not saying that it's bad, just it doesn't make you feel like they've done much to change.  Still, everything is within easy reach, and it all makes sense.  If you have ever driven any Honda before, you will automatically know where each control should be.  My biggest complaint is that the center dash seems to jut out at you, and then recesses back.  There's an uncovered storage area in front of the center-mounted gear shifter.  I don't like this layout because I aesthtically like the center dash to flow 
continuously... not be broken up.  Additionally, the "storage area" is a prime place to get dirt accumulation.  Lastly, it's wasted space if you park in public areas and don't want your personal belonging to show.
          
Well, the last part of the equation is Value, and the Accord surpasses expecations.  Honda offers no options, but offers many different "trim levels".  I test drove and was looking at the Accord EX-V6 w/ leather.  Basically, this is their top-of-the-line model.  The sticker price was $23,200.  The list of 
standard features included just about everything: leather seats, power seats, in-dash cassette/cd CHANGER, automatic climate control, home-link system, traction control... etc.   Additionally, the engine was great.  Knowing this car was such a good value made the decision between the boring-yet-functional Accord vs. exciting-expensive Import so difficult.
          
So, did Honda build the perfect car???  Well, actually, I did have some complaints.  I was disappointed with the styling in general, and particularly, the center dash.  Additionally, sitting in the back, there was considerable road noise even at low speeds.  This is one quality that the Acura's never had.  I also would have likes a Bose/premium sound system.  Other options that you may or may not miss include auto-dimming mirror, side-mirror defroster, and memory and heated seats.  (Most of these are on the TL) Also, the entire rear seat folds down... not in sections.  Additionally. the opening to the trunk is rather 
small (doesn't cover the entire seat), so the space is not as functional as you might think.
          
Given all the pluses and minuses, this is a phenomenal car for the $$$.  I don't think that there's a better car on the market in this price range.  The only comparable cars in terms of size/price are the Taurus and the Maxima.  I think that they are about $3K cheaper and more expensive, respectively.  Especially if 
you can deal with the sedate styling, you can't go wrong with this car.
          
As a sidenote, we ended up spending the extra cash for another TL.  (4 Acura's in 10 years)  For me, the aggressive styling, extra 25 hp, and few other goodies made more sense.  Additionally, we ended up getting a great deal on the TL.  While both will last for years, I will definitely be happier driving the TL.
