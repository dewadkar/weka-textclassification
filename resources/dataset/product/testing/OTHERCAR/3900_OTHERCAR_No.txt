            1994 we purchased our van, so how has it held up?
The interior keeps falling apart and the screws will not go back in.
It dies at stop lights, mechanics say (cant remember what is it called)
something needs to be unclogged so I had that done and a month later it started dying again, so I had it done four times and then I was told I have to have it done every 300-500 miles to keep it running smoothly, at $90 a pop.
At 5 years old and 70,000 miles it will not go into reverse when it is cold. And about 6 months ago the radio died.
And now it has a oil leak that is not fixable, I say this because I was told the engine and transmission will need to be removed at a cost of several thousands of dollars.

Other than that it is a good car, but I will not buy one again.<br><br>
