            The 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier is a decent car for its price (these days) and it's an overall nice drive.  Looking at this car from the outside, the first thing that comes to mind is the Honda Civic, and how I'd rather be looking at that car.  But for what you could spend on buying a Cavalier instead of a Civic is quite nice.  The Cavalier still puts up a good fight for its class, and it's definitely not a piece of garbage.

The exterior is nothing to brag about, yet I can't seem to find anything wrong with it either.  To me the car looks a little feminine, but what does that matter when you're inside of it, comfortably driving from place to place.  When you're in college or just don't want to spend too much, the Cavalier is a reliable, and more importantly, an affordable vehicle for that situation.  

My last car was a 1989 Chevrolet Cavalier, but then someone slammed into the back of me totaling the car completely!  That Cavalier had 144,000 miles on it, and very few problems that were cheap to get repaired.  So when I found a 1996 Cavalier, I was not disappointed at all; well I guess it could be a Civic, but you can't win them all.

The gas mileage isn't too bad, around 23 miles per gallon in the city and 27 on the highway.  The handling at high and low speeds is easy, and the pick-up is nothing to complain about either.  If you're looking for a cheap but decent ride, then check out the Cavalier!
