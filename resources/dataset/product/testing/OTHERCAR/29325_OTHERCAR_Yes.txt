            I made the mistake of sending my wife out to buy a truck.  4WD, extended cab.  Sounds simple, right?  Wrong.  She came back with this little bug of a thing, the Tracker.  I couldn't believe she bought this thing, but I didn't say too much since she'll be driving it.

After driving it to work one day, and having someone ask where my other roller skate was, I decided it would stay parked while I drove my 4WD F-250 diesel.   Imagine my chagrin the first time the weather dropped to zero and my big, powerful truck refused to start.   Right, here I go out into the bitter cold, where this little wimp of a vehicle started right up.   I seem to find myself driving it about once a week when it's too cold for my truck to be dependable.

Whenever we take a trip, with the two kids and the dog, we also seem to wind up taking the Tracker.   It goes at freeway speeds just fine, even with the tiny engine.

So.... as much as I hate to admit it, I guess it's a good alternative for a family vehicle, 4WD that's not too big.  It does drive like a car, and the whole family fits in it.  Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea after all.....   <br><br>
