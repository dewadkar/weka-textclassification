            We bought a Mavica because our other digital cameras were inconvenient to use, required cables and software, and didn't work well with NT (down load only 1 photo at a time).

After our success with the Mavica, we immediately bought 5 more.  It's so easy to use - pop in a floppy, turn it on, press the button.  Done!  No wires, cables, software to install.  Pop the floppy in any PC, and you have JPEG images ready to go.  Better yet - even if someone borrows it, they can just keep their floppy and return the camera.

I love the rechargeable battery, since our old Kodak DC120 needed expensive lithium disposables.

I use mine all the time - at home (for our 3 month old) and at work.  You can print photos immediately, or e-mail them to family and friends.  For work we were able to document an entire retreat on a few floppies.

Ours only goes as high as 640x480 resolution, but other models are better.  It's enough for casual shots, but not for major life events (we use the 35mm camera for baby photos too).

I don't like the zoom, which feels artificial and adjusts too quickly.  The camera is also bulky, but it's worth it to fit the floppy.

The LCD is totally trick - people are amazed and can't get over it how cool it is to see pictures you just took, and even have the option to delete and retake photos if someone's eyes are closed.

This camera is great for hobbyists and new parents, though you'll still need to keep your 35mm camera for birthdays and graduations.
