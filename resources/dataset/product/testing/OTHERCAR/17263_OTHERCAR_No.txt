            While my wife's car was being repaired (major accident, it's been in for 2 1/2 weeks!), I have been driving a rental Dodge Intrepid.  This car is quite a looker, with it's distinctive styling and sloping roofline.  The car is quite roomy, and has comfortable seating.

The car I got had 15,000 miles on it (now it has 17,000, sorry Enterprise!).  The overall driving experience was ok, but the acceleration was lackluster.  Brakes were very weak, with continued thumping.

The interior was a little disappointing as well.  The knobs, controls and finish seemed a little on the cheap side for such a dynamically styled car.  The radio seems low-tech, and the speakers rattle at anything above a whisper.

I know what you are thinking, that this is an abused rental car.  That does deem consideration, but remember that the car only had 15,000 on it.  I don't think that I would recommend this car to someone, as there are many others in this price range that seem to have higher quality production on the interior components.<br><br>
