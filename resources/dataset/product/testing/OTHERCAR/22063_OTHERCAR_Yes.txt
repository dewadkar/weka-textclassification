            I wanted a small easy to use camera that wasn't to hard on the wallet. The DC-215 fit the bill perfectly. I had already decided that I would rarely print out 8x10 photos so the one megapixel resolution was fine. The fact that it actually has a 2X optical zoom at this price made it very attractive; digital zooms just reduce the quality of the photograph.

 I bought it with a bundle that included a Compact Flash/USB card reader which is an absolute necessity for quick downloads. With a 32 megabyte flash card I can take 112 highest quality and highest resolution pictures before having to download to my computer. The pictures are sharp and clear - absolutely fabulous within 10 ft where most photographs are taken.

Long scenic shots could be better but they are more than acceptable. There is a pause between the shutter push and the actual shot so it takes a little anticipation to get the perfect action shot. 

I have taken over 500 shots with this camera so far and have received lots of positive comments about the results. The included software is pretty standard - Adobe Photodeluxe 2.0 and Pagemill 3.O. 

The included ArcSoft PhotoPrinter 2.0 software was the big surprise. It lets you make maximum use of every sheet of photo paper by allowing multiple shots and sizes in an amazing number of mixes. It fits very well with the camera's max resolution
