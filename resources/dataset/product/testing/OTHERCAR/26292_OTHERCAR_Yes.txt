            This review refers to the Si model in the US, which is called SiR in Canada.

This car meets all of the factors I wanted when I bought it. 

First, let me tell you why I bought this car. My prior car was a 1993 Volkswagen Corrado VR6. Frankly, I got tired of things going wrong with it and having to worry about it and baby it all the time. A car is meant to be driven, not to baby and worry about all the time! My life with the VW got so bad that I was afraid to use the sunroof because it had broken before and I didn't want it to break again, and I wouldn't ever want drive it on a short road trip with friends because I was always afraid something would go wrong with it! This is no way to live your life!

I finally said to hell with it. I sold the VW and bought a black 2000 Honda Civic Si. I have been a very happy, more secure, less nervous person ever since!

First and foremost, the Honda is sooooo reliable! I've now driven it for about 20,000 miles and the only thing I've had to do is oil changes. Heck, the first tune-up isn't even recommended until like 100,000 miles! The brakes will last that long too!  It's such a joy knowing that I can rely on my car without having to worry. 

The Honda is an economy car too. It's not too expensive, but what you get for your money is quite a lot. This car has all the amenities that I like-power sunroof with tilt, cruise control, power windows, not bad radio system, power door locks with remote, comfortable seats, nice instrumentation, rear seats fold down, etc, etc...And, I really like the fact that I get good gas mileage too! Afterall, gas prices are way expensive these days and it makes no sense to waste gas uneccessarily.

The Civic Si is also very sporty! It's quite fast and peppy when you rev it up. Yet, quite and comfortable when cruising on the freeway on long trips. 

The fit and finish of the car is not bad, however I have to admit that it was an adjustment from my prior VW with leather seats. The Honda paint seems a bit thin as well and could be better.
