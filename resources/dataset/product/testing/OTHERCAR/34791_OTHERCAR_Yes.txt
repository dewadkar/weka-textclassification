            When I first started driving, I started off in a sub compact.  While the car I had handled well, it just was not cut out for a Nebraska Ice Storm - where the Ice is measured in inches, and the police stop taking accident reports.  In fact it was in one such storm, where I decided to buy a SUV.  And so, after my sub compact had finished sliding down the hill.  I went looking for one of those urban monsters.  

I wanted one big enough to give me visibility, and tough enough that I'll be safe regardless of what happens.  Too be honest I was looking for a Jeep.  Not the Cherokee but a CJ7 or a Wrangler, depending on the price.  Instead I stumbled across my Montero.  

The ride is high, and the amenities on this model were few.  But it also met my number one requirement:  Affordable.  With 112,000 miles on the engine I expected some problems, but far more problems than what I've had.  Both the Starter Motor and the Front Brakes have had to be replaced, but considering that My Montero is now at 173,000 miles and is still ready to take on the Interstate, or a washed out road with hardly a groan.  

I would have to say that the Montero Sport has been one of the best buys that I've made.  <br><br>
