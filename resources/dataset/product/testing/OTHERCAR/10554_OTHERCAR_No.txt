            Our family bought the Voyager for holding passengers, size, and AWD, figuring it would be
sensible for Montana weather.  First of all, this is not an exciting car.  Its styling is blocky
and dull compared to more modern designs, and is not very smooth in looks, though I like the
wheel covers.  What I do like about this car is that it is big and holds a lot, and has authority,
has a decent amount of features like cruise control, ABS, 4 wheel drive, lots of lights, and
power windows/mirrors/locks.  It's ride is relatively smooth and quiet, and the front seat is
not bad for trips.  But move to the either of the rear seats, and you will be having much less fun.  Riding
in the back is a miserable experience, especially if there is more than one person in each row.
When the van has 7 people in it, you'll wish you were never born.  The seats are unsupportive
and have no headrests for all you whiplash and neck cramp fans out there, and are no good unless
you are going on a trip under 30 minutes.  As for the air conditioning, it is somewhat powerful
but has definite trouble reaching the back; on hot days, the car is a veritable furnace.  On
cold days, the car heats up relatively quickly but can be rather cold; obviously no heated seats
on our model.  There are numerous cupholders, but in the back are all one one side making them
awkward to reach.  There are also a bunch of little areas to stow things, which can be helpful
on trips.  A smart plan if you have a smaller family is to pull out the middle seat; you get
acres of cargo room and actually LEGROOM in the back.  Moving onto the ride and engine, ours
is powered by an okay 3.3L V6, which has pretty good acceleration, but not exactly sporty.
The transmission makes frightening straining sounds when you are crossing mountain passes and 
going over hills which is rather alarming; in those situations the Voyager feels underpowered.
The ride is quite smooth in the city, doing decently on potholes, but on the interstate the
Voyager makes a noise like a jet aircraft engine which numbs your brain, and is not always 
smooth.  Wind noise is horrible around windy areas; the squealing can take you by surprise
and is not fun.  Moving on to my favorite chapter; reliability.  Read my lips: this vehicle is
a LEMON.  We have had lots of problems with stalling, esp. while idling, which is especially
problematic on hot days but can happen at any time; the car will shudder and die.  One time the
power steering went out for no reason.  Also, the ENTIRE transmission had to be replaced at one
point, as well as the whole fuel pump system and thermostat system which broke. Lots and lots
of problems, which can happen at any time.  Keep in mind that this all happened under 75K miles
which is how much this car has racked up in 9 years.  Its reliability has improved after 
numerous repairs and long, expensive visits to the shop, which have probably totalled more than
the car's worth. *Extremely poorly made*, rattles like a thousand snare drums and has all sorts
of loose screws, unidentifyable rattles, and so on; has been stuffed in many places with kleenex
to shut it up. Finally, this van can be a big clunky to park and corner with, so beware.
In conclusion, this is an okay minivan which has possibly improved for 2000, but is sadly lacking
in many areas and is unreliable at times.  Think very hard before touching this vehicle with a 
10-ft pole.<br><br>
