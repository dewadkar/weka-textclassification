            The PT Cruiser has a very appealing look inside and out. I rented one of these cars recently and was very pleased with the smooth, comfortable ride and the good gas mileage. The engine was powerful enough to efficiently pass cars on the highway yet quiet and smooth idling while cruising through town. 

The interior of these cars is simple but visually satisfying. The front seats are very roomy which was important to me since I am tall and do not enjoy being cramped in small cars. I tested out the back seat and it was slightly less roomy than the front but manageable. This car could easily accommodate 4 passengers comfortably on long trips and a fifth person could manage for a short journey. 

The traction of the rear wheels was the only thing about this car that was unsatisfactory to me. Every time I gave the car a little gas around a turn, the rear would slide out slightly and cause the tires to squeal. I felt like I had to be extra cautious when driving through the rain in this vehicle. 

Overall I would not mind owning a PT Cruiser because the ride was smooth, they are fun to drive, and they draw much attention due to the stylish body and good paint schemes.
