            This was the first new car that I had ever purchased.  I test drove everything on the market. Nothing drives like a Saturn.  It handles really well and rides like a dream.  I made my decision based on the insurance cost.  I wanted either the Saturn SC1 or the Honda Civic.  The insurance was cheaper on the Saturn. 
 The brakes started making terrible grinding sounds about 9 months after I had purchased the car.  The service people at the dealership informed me this was normal with metal brake pads and that everything was fine.  When they finally checked the brakes months later, with me complaining the entire time, they had to change out the rotors because there were no brake pads. 
 Just as the warranty went out on the car, so did everything else.  The worst thing was the motor started using 3 quarts of oil every 3,000 miles.  This started with about 35,000 miles on the car.  The dealership had to rebuild the motor at about 45,000 miles.  They originally informed me that I would have to pay for this since the warranty was expired.  I had taken the car to the dealership for every service that was done to it.  I finally called Saturn headquarters and they paid for it.  The car still uses oil, but not as badly.  The sun roof leaks.  The vent for the air conditioner does not work.  The transmission is very loud when it changes gears.  It has plenty of other minor squeaks and quirks. 
 It still drives better than anything else I have driven.  The gas mileage is good.  Trunk space is very limited.  The back seats are slightly cramped but not unbearable.  This is not the car for a large man. Some car repair knowledge is a good idea if purchasing this car.    <br><br>
