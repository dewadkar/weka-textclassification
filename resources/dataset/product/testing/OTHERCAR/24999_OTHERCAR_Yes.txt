            The Ricoh RDC300 is one of the best purchases I have made. I originally borrowed my sister's Ricoh to see how it would work with my Mac computer--but she asked me to return it within 2 weeks, and I now know why! I had several items that needed to be photographed to go on the web. Specifically, the digital photos were to be used on eBay. So I bought my own Ricoh.

I was very surprised with the extremely crisp detail and brilliant color quality I achieved using this camera. I even received e-mails from other auctioneers asking what scanner I was using to get such great pictures. Many were shocked when I explained that I wasn't using a scanner, but the little digital Ricoh.

My favorite feature of this camera is its fold-out LCD screen. It gave me a lot of flexibility in dealing with less than perfect lighting, and getting up close to a variety of different items. I photographed everything from sparkly jewelry to large quilts and tiny beads with NO PROBLEMS!

The software is very easy to install, and the customer service is great. After two years of rugged use, the USB cord connection became loose. I asked if I could have a new one, and it was sent to me right away!

This light-weight wonder is worth every penny, especially if you are into online auctions.<br><br>
