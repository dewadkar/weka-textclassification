            As an avid Toyota MR2 fan, it would be a gross understatement to say I am extremely disappointed by the new MR2 Spyder.  When Toyota announced that it would be selling a new MR2, this time as a roadster, I was thrilled.  This announcement came at roughly the same time as the debut of the 240 horsepower Honda S2000.  Since the two cars would probably be in direct competition, I thought (read hoped) that America would again have access to the venerable 3S-GTE engine from the 91-95 Toyota MR2.

For those unfamiliar with the older MR2s, here is a very brief history.  The MR2 came to America as a 1985 model.  It was a Mid-engine Rear-wheel-drive, 2 seater (hence the name of the car).  In 1991 it lost it's boxy 80's look and picked up (in my humble opinion) the best engine Toyota ever made, the 3S-GTE.  This engine is a 2.0 liter (small and light), 200 horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder.  

I also imagined the new MR2 Spyder would look like the prototype TRD (Toyota Racing Design) MR2 Spyder, which was just a 1991-1995 with a soft top and speedster-style boot for the top.  I may be partial, but it was one of the best looking cars I've seen in my life.

You can now understand my disappointment that the new MR2 Spyder is really a mid-engined Miata.  That's all it is.  Take a Miata, remove the trunk (the MR2 Spyder has something like 6 cubic feet of storage), move the engine behind the seats, put the spare tire under the hood, and take it to a body shop where all the workers are on hardcore hallucinogens, and I am willing to bet you will have an exact copy of the MR2 Spyder.  

I appreciate Toyota's attempt to bring a little sportiness and performance back to America, but in my opinion, the MR2 Spyder is a day late and a dollar short.<br><br>
