            I bought my 1998 Chevy PK in Sept 1997.  I bought the short wheelbase with the third door and have been very happy with it.  The truck rides like a car and is our preferred vehicle for long trips for it's comfort.  I got the 5.0 litre V8 and if I had to do it over again I would definately get the 5.7 litre.  I pull a boat quite often and, although the small V8 does fine, I could use the extra power at times.  Since  Chevy has remained consistent over so many years I recommend buying whatever year Chevy your budget allows - a GREAT truck! <br><br>
