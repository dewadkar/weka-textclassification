            PLease firstly disreguard the opinion in the dislikes column, they obviously have never seriously driven the sidekick like we have.  I am 6'4" and 275# and have more than ample room in the driver seat.  i have fit plenty into the rear for storage even with the seats up.  Unlike the CRV, or the RAV-4, the sidekick actually has a 4lo position in the trnsfer case.  If you are looking at small SUV's do not think 4WD and AWD are the same; they are not in any way!  We have had our sidekick on rocky trails, mountain areas, mud, water crossings, wash sand, gravel, highway, and anything else imaginable, and it has done everything just fine.  That is also inn stock form with very mild tread tires.  It is my wifes truck and I own a fullsize Bronco, but I wouldnt mind another sidekick to cruise around in.  They are reliable, fairly priced, good access to extra goodies, and an all around good little ute.  Places like www.calmini.com and www.rocky-road.com offer lots of little accessories for the sidekick and the sami (which we have also owned 3 of).  In fact, if you look on the calmini catalog from 98, you will see a black 4-door on the back cover all tricked out and lifted.  I would recommend this truck to anyone who wants an entry level or first time 4x4 that also needs to be a daily driver yet can also evolve as your needs to go further into the 4x4 world increases.
