            What can I say about the Malibu? I guess you could say that I have mixed views on this vehicle. I bought this vehicle new in 1999 with 12 miles for 18K plus sales tax. This vehicle is the LS and I have every option but leather and the sunroof. Now lets go to the good and the bad.

Good Points:

The 3.1 OVH pushrod engine is an old design but very reliable and proven. This engine no longer overheats in traffic like my other Chevy 3.1 did.  The transmission is very smooth but I do not like the fact that I cannot check its fluid level. The breaks work very well even though I have started noticing a squeal at the 30K mile mark. 
I like the looks of the car because itï¿½s not too boring but not to flashy either.

Bad Points:

Interior squeaks and rattles. This thing squeaks so much it drowns out all the road noises. No lie. I have taken it to the dealer several times for this problem and other problems. For example the radio reception is non-existent. Thank you Mr. CD player. I have had it in the shop three times for the radio. When they fix it and it will work for a couple of weeks and then broke again. Another problem in the break lights. The bulbs get so hot it melts the plastic housing. This has happen two times and again they replace it under warranty. The only concern I have is that I only have 6K miles under the warranty left. Is it time for a new car? Maybe
