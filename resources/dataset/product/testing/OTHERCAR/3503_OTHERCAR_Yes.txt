            If you are in the market for a luxury vehicle and don't relish spending 50K or more, consider purchasing a used, 3-5 year old Mercedes E Class vehicle.  I recently purchased a used, 1997 Mercedes E420 Sport instead of a new Acura or Lincoln and I couldn't be happier with my choice.

The vehicle I purchased came with options such as Automatic Slip Reduction, Xenon headlamps with washers, Sport package (upgraded styling, suspension and tires/wheels) and Bose sound system.  With approximately 58K miles at time of purchase, the car was in almost new condition but cost less than 28K; much less than most new, lower end luxury cars.  

I can say without reservation that this car is the best I've owned.  The performance is outstanding and marked by the smooth, quiet Mercedes trademark ride.  It's styling is classic and does not look old or dated despite the fact it's been on the road a few years.  As you would expect from a high-end German car, there are no rattles and the fit and finish is still perfect.

Buying a used car is always a risk, however, with proper care and maintenance, an average Mercedes should last well over 200K miles.  The majority of its depreciation is also absorbed by the time it's mileage crosses 50K so a well researched purchase can be a decent investment.  My advice would be to ensure that the proposed purchase be complete with its maintenance records and you invest in having a 3rd party mechanic inspect the car.  The vehicle I purchased was a corporate fleet car so it enjoyed regular, documented dealer maintenance.

Although there is nothing like driving a well cared for Mercedes, be advised that there are certain minor drawbacks.  Regular maintenance on these cars is relatively expensive and cannot be performed at your average mechanic's shop.  Even simple procedures, like a tune-up or oil change, are 1-2 times as expensive as a Toyota or Honda and require a mechanic skilled in Mercedes service.  Mercedes paint, although beautiful, also requires regular maintenance so expect to absorb the cost of detailing your purchase every year or so.
