            Camera's are something i find myself writing reviews about all the time. Mainly because it is easy to comment on their quality and crispness when taking a photo. But this camera i must admit was the easiest to write about. With a crystal clear LCD monitor, a comfortable feel to it making it a breeze to take photos without having to search for a button, and its ability to save in 5 different formats is truly exceptional.
The picture that you take is why you pay so much for a camera. But this camera you dont. A relativly cheap camera for whole lot of quality. Sure you can pay up to $3000 for a good digital camera but why?
This camera gives a high resolution picture because of its larger than normal CCD sensor which retrieves alot more info than other CCD's of same sensor count in other cameras.
This provides clear, crisp, bright, and colourful pictures.
The camera has a maximum 6.1 Million Pixel output which really provides a realistic image, and also a printable image quality.
Another amazing feature of this camera is its ability to adapt and accept different forms of recording media. This includes SmartMedia, Compactflash or IBM Microdrive. From this recordable media you can then download your images to your computer through an easy to setup and install USB port which provides instant images everytime. Before you start taking images you have the choice of the format in which your images will be saved. A real pro if you dont have the conventional image software.
This camera makes it real easy to become a pro and even if your not, your photos with their crispness and colour will make you think twice about a career change to photography. If you are looking for an asset that will record your families lives in quality, than this camera is for you.
