            I love my Grand Am! It is economical to drive, is comfy and has all the features of a much more expensive car. It has great style, I love the moon roof, often driving with it open and the air conditioning on..
I really cannot complain about anything so far. The car notified me when I took a nail in the tire by alerting me to check pressure in tires. 
It has a great sound system. (I have a CD player that is standard now)
My car is white with charcoal interior, and heads turn to look at it!
In the Winter, it hold the road nicely, and in the Summer it keeps me looking and *feeling* cool. 
I'm leasing my car because my nephew works at GM, so the price was definitely right for an older than dirt, semi-retired lady.
Check it out and treat yourself right.
Electric windows and doors and keyless entry make it real safe also!<br><br>
