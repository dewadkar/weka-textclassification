            I purchased my car in 1993. This was my first car purchase so naturally it's my first love. I have drove friend's cars and let me tell you so far none of them can compare to my Caddy. I love the attention I get when i'm out cruising and I love the feel of this car. I have had minor problems but i'll tell you a little hint. I never take my car to the Cadillac dealers. I have my own mechanic and I purchase my own parts. 
I learned early on that these dealers over charge you..big time! My weather striping around my back window needed to be replaced and I went to the dealer who wanted to charge me 175.00 to replace a piece of plastic. There was no way I was going to pay all that money so I called my local GM part dealer and found out that the weather strip only cost 17.00, so the Cadillac dealer was gonna charge me over 150.00 for labor alone. I went out and purchased the part and had my mechanic do it for me and it only cost me 45.00. A lot of people avoid buying this type of car because of the high price to repair it. With a little searching and a phone book these high prices can be avoided. Back to my Caddy. <br><br>
