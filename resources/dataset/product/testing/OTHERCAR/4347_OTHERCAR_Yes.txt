            I love my BMW.  However, the service I have received from the dealer and from BMW itself has been less than acceptable.  Since I leased the car new in May of 98 I've had to take the car back to the dealer at least 6 times.  Yesterday my Airbag light came on for no reason.  Here's trip number 7.  

Late one night I awoke to my car alarm.  The only way to shut the alarm off was to leave the car running or disconnect the battery.  The dealer inspected the car and said everything was fine.  The very next night I experienced the same problem.  

The one time I had occasion to call the BMW 24hour roadside assistance program they refused to help me.  I was simply told they didn't have anyone available in Columbus Oh at night.  Given the sticker price of the car I expect to get what I was promised.<br><br>
