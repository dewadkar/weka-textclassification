            The glory of being in a car that when you press on the gas you can hear the roar of the engine and can go 185 and more. I'm talking about the 2000 Dodge Viper GTS 2 door Coupe. The 2000 Viper has not really had any major changes to the car. The Viper is really a racing car which can be sold at 76,293 dollars with everything in it. 

The Viper horsepower is 450 and the rpm's are 5200. It has a torque of 490 and 3700 rpm. It has 10 cylinders and the engine size is 8.0 liter.
This car can seat 2 people driver and 1 passenger. This car weighs around 3,460 pounds and has a length of 177 inches. 

When driving this car it gets 11 miles a gallon in the city and 20 miles a gallon on the highway. You'll will be stopping for gas a lot and spending major bucks on the cost of gas for this car. This car comes in a 6 speed transmission. 

I did not buy this vehicle yet, but I look to save a lot money so my dreams can come true.I love this car because the major speed, and style of the car. The only thing I hate is the limited space and the money spent on gas.

This is a car for all ages so everybody can have fun in it.

If you like people looking at you when you fly by them this is the car for you.<br><br>
