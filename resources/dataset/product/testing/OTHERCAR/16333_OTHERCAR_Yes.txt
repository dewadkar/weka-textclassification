            At my last job, I served as a web-designer for the local high-school. For this job the school loned me their digital camera to use to take pictures around the school. Low and behold, they handed me the HP PhotoSmart C200xi Digital Camera. At the time, I was not too familiar with digital cameras, but was very technologically literate, so I immediately checked it out.

The first thing I noticed about this camera was the ease of use. It functions just like a normal camera (actually, its probably easier). You basically have your lens and your shutter release button. However, this piece of equipment has more than meets the eye. With the HP PhotoSmart, you have three choices of quality. The supplied eight megabyte memory card can hold eighty pictures at the lowest resolution, fourty at the middle resolution, and 17 at the highest resolution. You can also buy memory cards that store more pictures (16 and 32 Megabyte cards are available). Overall, this function allows someone to take a bunch of low quality photos (maybe for the web or to send to a friend via e-mail) or allows a professional very high quality images (suitable for print).

The camera comes with a hand viewing window on the back, along with an overly simplistic menu button (this allows pictures to be deleted or modified while still in the camera). The camera comes with an optional flash and some extra settings for improved picture taking.

Although what I've said about the camera is great so far, I do have some gripes about it. One thing I found very irritating was the battery situation. In many of the other cameras I have used, I high-powered battery distinct to the camera is shipped with it. However, with the PhotoSmart, it only takes AA batteries. I guess this is fine for amateurs, but, it really doesn't provide the power or length of use for any serious job. I noticed that when using the flash or the viewing window, the batteries run out extremely fast.

Another tiny thing I found annoying was the fact that HP recommends you to use a DC adaptor when loading the pictures onto the computer (via a provided serial port), instead of running down the previously explained, feeble batteries. However, HP refuses to provide any kind of adapter. I think that if a company mentions something you SHOULD have, than they SHOULD provide it with the product.

Well, that's all I have to say about that. In summary this is a great camera with a couple of defects that can mostly be neglected. It comes at a great price (when compared to some of the other cameras on the market) and is incredibly easy to use.

Here are some stats for you:

-Full automatic for point-n-shoot simplicity
-1 Megapixel resolution
-$270 (great price!)
-2x Digital zoom for closeup shots (doesn't work too good)
-8 MB Compact Flash memory card for storing up to 80 photos<br><br>
