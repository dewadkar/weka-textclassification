            Because we have three children, we needed to buy a minivan.  We decided upon the Dodge Grand Caravan because of the price and features.  Anyone considering a minivan should buy one with doors on both sides.  We also appreciate the built in car seats.  Many times we have extra nieces and nephews with us and these built in car seats are such a pleasure.  The Grand Caravan has lots of room in the trunk for groceries and packages or strollers, etc.  It rides well and these make it a nice minivan.

I suggest not purchasing this van because there are many engine, transmission and other problems with this vehicle.  AT 37,000 miles we needed to replace the transmission, the serpintine (spelling unsure) belt, and the major drive axle.  We've been told by mechanics that these items should never have failed at this early stage.  These problems usually occur in cars with over 75,000 miles.  Because of the warranty that expired at 36,000, Dodge did cover some of the expenses, but not all.  Our biggest concern is what we can expect next in terms of problems.  

Our next minivan will not be a Dodge Grand Caravan because of this.  Our children's safety is more important than anything.  These problems happened close to home but could have easily have happened while away and at night.<br><br>
