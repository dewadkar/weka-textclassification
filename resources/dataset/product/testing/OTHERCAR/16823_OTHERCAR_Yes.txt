            Brief Specifications: 

The 1994 Camaro Z-28 base model came with the following options: 
8 cyl 5.7 L Engine, 6-Speed Transmission, AM/FM Stereo Tape, Alarm System, Aluminum/Alloy Wheels, Anti-Lock Brakes, Center Console, Digital Clock, Dual Air Bag Restraints, Intermittent Wipers, Limited Slip Diff, Power Brakes, Power Steering, Rear Spoiler, Sport Suspension, Tachometer, Tilt Steering Wheel, Tinted Glass, Velour/Cloth Seats 

Unfortunately, this is not nearly enough for me. I recently (yesterday) test-drove a 1994 Camaro Z-28 and was not nearly as thrilled as I thought I would be. The unbridled power just didn't seem to be enough for this sports car fanatic.

The Camaro came stripped down with no power options what-so-ever. The only options were the ones you see listed above. The dealer started the price at 10,900 dollars - to which I laughed in his face. After all was said and done, I was given their final offer of 8,400 dollars with 500 dollars down. I declined.

After driving this car for about 12 hours over the course of two days, I found that this car didn't measure up to my previous 1996 Camaro RS that was completely loaded. I couldn't justify buying a car simply for an engine. I guess this compromises my sports car enthusiast status, but never the less, I am not satisfied with the quality of car.

The loaded Camaros are well worth your money. I believe whole-heartedly that the Camaro is the best bang for the buck buy. My RS Camaro was a total gem and I sold it to my ex-girlfriend who gets so many compliments; I wish I hadn't sold it. 

Additionally, the Z-28 is not all it's cracked up to be in the 1994 year. The engine is the 350 LT1 and not quite as powerful and lethal as the new LS1 350 Cheverolet has moved to. This particular model carried about 285 Horsepower and the new LS1 Z-28's have about 305. I believe a significant difference is there. Not to mention, this car wouldn't even have been able to take my buddies 1989 IROC-Z28 Camaro. 

Unfortunately, I have decided to purchase a 1992 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4 with 320 Horsepower. (twin-turbo) I have owned a Eagle Talon Tsi, so I have an idea of how to modify the turbo for extra power and boost. 

For all my Cheverolet buddies out there, don't hate me, I still love America's Car, but I will have to wait for a few more years. This experience just turned me off for a while.
