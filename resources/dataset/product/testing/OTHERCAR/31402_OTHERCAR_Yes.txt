            The day came when I was to get a new car.  The battle was between a 1997 white Honda Accord EX Gold Edition or a 2000 Oldsmobile Alero GLS, in Silvermist.  I immediately walked over to the Honda and sat down.  Oh yes, leather seats, a sunroof, it had everything i wanted.  I walked over to look at the Alero mainly to please my father, and sat down, then went back to test drive the Accord.  It was a nightmare.  Where was the smooth ride I was hoping for?  
It was back at the dealer's, waiting to be recognized.  I was disappointed in the Honda and decided to take the Alero out.  I got to a straight stretch and let her loose.  This was an Oldsmobile?!  My head hit the back of the seat as I let up on her.  My friend who was sitting in the back, had a look of delight, as I did as well.  Back at the dealer's I learned I had just fallen in love with a 2000 Oldsmobile Alero GLS.  It was silver with cloth seats, a tape & CD deck, huge trunk (great when you're fixing to go off to college!), foglights, aluminum wheels that really sparkle in the sun, basically everything the factory offers EXCEPT a sunroof and leather seats.  It was a four door sedan with a 3.4L V6. VRroom.
Now, it's been four months and she's still looking good. The only service I have had done so far is an oil change to synthetic, and had the tires rotated.  One of my friends has a 2001 Alero with the 4-cyl and she talks about how hers will get up and go too.  
My gripe is mainly about the gas mileage.  It gets about 20-25 mpg on the highway.  My car has a spoiler, and it adds drag to the car and makes it slightly worse than an Alero without.  The Alero has really been a very good car for me, the air conditioner is cold, even now in mid-july it kicks in really quickly, and all of the power options (power windows, seats, and mirrors) make it even better.  I think it would be a great car for a family or a cheaper sports-type car for a teenager who wants a Mustang or Trans-Am (that was me!).
