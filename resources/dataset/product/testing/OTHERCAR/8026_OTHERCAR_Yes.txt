            Ricoh RDC-300Z: Last Updated 7-18-00

  I have owned this Ricoh camera for about 2 years and I truly love it.  It is simple, lightweight, and easy to use.  I have to admit that this camera may not compare well with those $600 digital cameras, but ricoh has truly set the standard for a digital camera.  One of the best features of this camera is take extreme close up pictures.  This can allow people to take pictures of an object maybe for work or home. I have used this camera in creating a graduation album for a class, and it truly made it a worthwhile experience.  After taking one single picture, I was able to immediately take a look at it to determine whether or not to take another shot.  
  This camera is basically for those who just want a decent camera which is not expensive.  I truly recommend this product for those that take pictures for general use.  Although this camera is discontinued by Ricoh, it is still going strong.

Ease of Use:
  All the buttons on this Ricoh are pretty much self explanatory.  There's really no need to look in a manual to figure out what a button does.  Taking quick pictures is easy as just pushing one button.  After pushing the button, it takes a few seconds to store the image that you took.

Upgradibility:
  The camera uses a mini &quot;smartcard&quot; to store images in the camera.  If you ever find the need for more space or pictures, you can always purchase a &quot;smartcard&quot; at a local electronics or camera store with more memory.  Instead of using floppy disks, the &quot;smartcard&quot; provides the advantage of storing as much as 200 photos on the card.  

Connectivity:
  Through a cable, you are enabled to connect the camera to your computer including with the provided software.  You are able to transfer the pictures on your camera into your camera to store them.  While connected to the computer, you are able to control the camera with your computer.

Software:
  The software provided with the Ricoh camera has many features and options including ease of use.  When images are downloaded from the camera into the software, you pictures are neatly organized into albums where you can view your pictures in thumbnails.  If you want, you can select pictures and view a slideshow with them to present it in a professional way.

Accessories:
  There are some accessories available for your Ricoh camera such as a case, or even a remote control to take pictures from distance by yourself.  

Quality:
  I would have to say this camera has quality.  When you move the camera around to see what is on the screen, it is all in realtime.  In very cheap digital cameras, you will see that the screen will show low quality resolution and will be laggy.  

Please rate my opinion to help me determine whether I can provide more information.<br><br>
