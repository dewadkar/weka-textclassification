            Every heard of a Buick Skyhawk?  If not, then you are certainly not alone.  The Skyhawk was the Buick version of the GM J-Body front wheel drive subcompact platform which appeared in 1982.  While the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac J2000/Sunbird became as common to see on public roads as cops in doughnut shops, the "senior" subcompacts (Oldsmobile Firenza, Buick Skyhawk, Caddilac Cimarron) were never very popular, these three GM brands being traditionally associated with larger vehicles.  The Cimarron disappeared after 1987, and the Firenza (gone after 1988) and Skyhawk (gone after 1989) did not adopt the second generation J-Body platform which debuted in 1988, but carried on with the original platform and vastly reduced options.

Thus, my Skyhawk represents the high point of the breed, 1987.  Best of all, my car is turbocharged!  A 1.8L SOHC turbo with muti-point fuel injection became available as an option for Skyhawk and Sunbird in 1984 (the Cavalier, Firenza, and Cimarron used the 2.8L OHV V-6 instead), and lasted until 1986.  In 1987, a much improved 2.0L SOHC turbo took its place with far better reliability and improved performance due to its extra displacement, water AND oil cooled turbo, superior knock sensors, and newly developed sequential fuel injection.  While the 2.0L SOHC turbo could be found in Sunbirds from 1987 to 1990, it was available in the Skyhawk in 1987 ONLY.

1987 was a special year throughout Buick in that it was also the last year for Buick's awe-inspiring 3.8L OHV turbo engine in its Regal and bad boy Grand National.  1987 was also marked by the apperance of the wicked Grand National GNX, the Darth Vader mobile that could turn 13.4 in the quarter mile and get almost 30 miles per gallon on the highway.  Yeah, it's hard to believe, but there were two times when Buicks were cool cars to have, 1967-71 (musclecars), and 1984-87 (turbos).  My car comes from one of those periods, so I feel a *bit* differently about it than your normal Buick owner.  Well, okay, the magnificant chrome yacht that is the '58 Limited (what a grille!) and the original '63-'65 Riveria are awesome cars that are also Buicks.  But for the most part, it's a stodgy group o' vehicles.

Sure, the supercharged Regals and Park Avenues of today are decent looking (really), semi-luxury cars that are pretty quick at 0-60 in around 7 and 7.7 seconds, respectively, but they evoke no passion and are never something a 19 year old guy or girl would drive (or afford).

I was lucky to find this car.  I'm not sure of the exact numbers, but I believe it is one of less than 700 made.  And how many exist 15 years later?  I'm sure it's not many.

I obtained the car in very shabby condition for $400 almost two years ago.  After a considerable amount of money and effort by both myself and my father, it has turned into a wonderful vehicle for all purposes.

The car has a suprisingly attractive form, with its squarish stance, covered headlights, and grinning front end.  The rear features Buick's trademark full width taillamps with blackout lenses (from the factory!  not just a import fad!).  Managing to be both cute and muscular at the same time, the car really is attractive, being cuter than the more aggressive Pontiac Sunbird GT.  My car is white with some blacked out trim, and a pair of fat indigo blue stripes and a aftermarket dual exhaust (no idiotically huge tips; this is a Buick, after all) make it different from other Skyhawks you might see (a rare happening).  The headlights, while cool, have developed a mind of their own.  The right one sometimes refuses to open when the lights are on, or close when they are off.  A faulty gear in the motor is to blame, but I have been unable to locate a replacement.  The manual adjust can always be used when needed.

The interior is a clone of the one used in the Grand National.  A tasteful blend of black seats with silver inserts and black with silver and red accented upholstry is what drew my father to the car in the first place.  Factory original yet custom looking, I contrast it with the boring muted earthtones so prevalent in modern vehicles.  The seats strike an excellent blend between support and give, and they are very comfortable.  The head rest is certainly outdated in its rather useless placement, but the inside is quite inviting for an 80's subcompact, especially one from GM.  Front room is pretty good even for my lanky frame, and the rear is no worse than any other small car. (Loving your car DOES NOT make it roomy, I'm afraid)  The tilt steering wheel comes in handy when things get hot and heavy in the front seat... ^_^  The dashboard features black-face guages with trick red back-lighting that goes perfectly with the amber shade of my Kenwood CD player.

The car was really pretty rattle-free at first, but the pair of subwoofers I put in the trunk soon made the dashboard pretty noisy.  I discovered the reason was the shabby workmanship done by the installer, and an afternoon with a screwdriver and the loose screws set things straight.  The air conditioner works well, and the heater even better.  Excessive amounts of heat generated by the turbo mean the heater takes no more than 2 minutes to reach stir-fry temperatures even in sub-zero Nebraska winter, so watch that fan speed!  The radio and speakers were long ago replaced by a vastly superior aftermarket setup, so I don't recall what they sounded like.

The ride quality is also Buick soft, with only major bumps really registering into your underside.  The handling is  pretty taut, as the car packs the firmer sport supension.  The economy car roots mean its not exactly a corner carver, with some body roll and lateral compliance, but it does pretty well, if no match for something like an Eclipse or Talon with double-wishbone suspension.  The fat P215/60 tires on 14 inch Shelby aluminum wheels provide solid grip for all but the most boneheaded moves, yet can be spun from some good old turbocharged torque if you want to be naughty.

The engine is the heart and soul of the car.  Being turbocharged, the engine makes all sorts of weird noises as it goes about its business, often drawing concerned questions from those new to the car.  While subdued by the excellent sound deadening in the car, opening the hood unleashes a torrent of mechanical noise.  The engine becomes quite throaty under load, and turns to a vicious, metallic rip at the redline of 6500 rpm.  The exhaust growls with suprising masculinity when the turbo cuts in with max boost (12psi) at 4000 rpm, but is otherwise quiet.  My aftermarket exhaust has a "glug glug" sound not unlike a small-displacement motor boat.  No rice here.

Whatever its aural statements, the engine certainly delievers the goods when the you hit the go pedal.  Despite my car having a automatic, the respectable specs of 165 hp @ 5600 rpm and 175 lb-ft @ 4000 rpm combine with a modest curb weight of 2265 lbs to turn in 0-60 times of around 6.5 seconds.  These times where incredible for 1987, and the only external betrayal of its mini-muscle car potential is the subtle hood bulge with "2.0L Turbo" in chrome lettering.  Unlike the 1984-1986 turbos, there is no "T-Type" identification badges about the car.  He he, all the better for impromptu drag races with those annoying Honda Civic owners.  The Eclipse/Talon/Laser turbos may pack 40 more horsepower, but they also pack almost 700 more pounds, so acceleration times are very much alike.  I point out with pride that the brand new SVT Ford Focus and Honda Civic Si are both somewhat slower than my humble Buick, because they have similar horsepower, but need to rev more and are pretty porky cars for their size.  Check the latest mags if you don't believe me.  Better crash protection is the reason cars have become so heavy again, by the way, so don't run into my featherweight!

I'm not knocking these cars, for they are my breathren.  I can't read an issue of <i>Car Craft</i> or <i>Hot Rod</i> that doesn't make fun of four-bangers or front wheel drive at least a dozen times.  I have subscriptions to <i>Sport Compact Car</i> and <i>Turbo</i>, which, unforunately, still have nothing to do with my ride except in general terms.  That's the price you pay for taking the road less traveled, so don't expect to see tech articles on this car.  It's unforunate that the Focus is the only domestic small car that isn't lame.  (Sorry, Chrysler is run by the Germans now, which isn't a bad thing) Is GM even awake?  Oh, I forgot.  They sell trucks now.  *shudder*

The engine has enough torque that you can get around town without having to exceed 3000 rpm, something that cannot be said for small DOHC engines, which need revs to produce the goods.  In the American tradition, the torque comes on strong right off the line.  (Okay, okay, so the engine's actually from Brazil, not America)  The non-turbo version has its torque peak at a V8-like 2800 rpm.  The automatic, despite being hampered by only 3 speeds, does a good job of picking the right gear and holding it until you let off the accelerator.  My original transmission was not as responsive as the current one, taken from a 1.8L Sunbird, and the excellent modulational means you can pick gears with your right foot at will.

The engine runs much better at highway speeds than idling around town, due to its tendency to heat up quickly at low speeds.  However, the engine turns some 3800 rpm at 75 mph in top gear, and that's not a recipe for quiet cruising.  Gas mileage has always been impressive, beating the EPA estimates by a suprising amount.  It averages about 35 mpg around town and 41 on the highway.  Yeah, I don't believe it, either.  Premium gas is necessary for maximum boost levels, but the knock sensors automatically prevent knocking on regular by dialing back the boost from 12 to 8 psi, preventing engine damage.  I plan on converting to a manual when the current tranny dies, but it's doubtful I'll be able to improve my 0-60 time much.

The engine design has oiling problems, and the camshaft will quickly grind itself to pieces if the oil isn't changed regularly.  Also, the head bolts have a tendency to come loose and leak oil if not watched, and this could lead to a blown head gasket if left untreated.  The car had a totalled turbo and ran on 3 cylinders when I got it.  The engine has NEVER refused to start, and while it heats up in a disappointingly short amount of time in heavy traffic, its has NEVER overheated.  Overall, the car has proved itself to be perfectly reliable when taken care of properly.  It leaks a bit from the oil pump, but nothing more than a half a quart every two months.  On the downside, repairs are VERY expensive due to the unique layout of the engine, and replacement of the turbo and camshaft was a pricey affair.  Pay vilgilant attention or be ready to bust out the wallet!

Generally, the body is rust free......except for the lower part of the doors, which has caused the outer door skin to seperate and is the main source of rattling in the car.  All first gen J-bodies have this problem.  The passenger side door groans a bit upon opening, but that's due to a drunk old guy in a Ford F-350 who hit me.  The rust is not very visible, but it is pretty bad, and I'm not sure what I can do about it at the present.  Also, the exhaust seems to be a spot that can rust can attack, as the original one nearly fell off and the current one is looking pretty brown now.  Stainless steel is the way to go for the next upgrade, I think.

Overall, this car demands your attention and money, but rewards with a suprising combination of power and gas mileage.  In short, a great car for a cash-strapped, girl-hunting young gearhead like myself.  And no one will ever have one like it at cruise night, nor will they know what it is.  "It's like a Cavalier, except it's a Buick... and it's actually cool!"  *Sorry, I owned a '83 Cavy before, so I have to make fun of it (Check out my review on that one, too)*
