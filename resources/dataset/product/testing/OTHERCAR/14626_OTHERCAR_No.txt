            I bought this car so that my wife and three year old daughter would have something safer to drive than the 92 Mazda 626 they were driving.

Actually, except for one recurrent problem that is driving us nuts, we really like the car.  We opted for the mid level GLT, with most options.

The car is very comfortable.  The optional home link sun visor opens both the gate for our community and the garage door.  The car both accelerates well and handles very nicely, when it is not in the shop.  We like the cd stereo and the air / heating system.

However, we have been to the dealer closing in on ten times for the same problem- the check engine light comes on and stays on.  Various &quot;cures&quot; for this condition include replacing the fuel injection system, and at least two replacements of the computer.  Usually the dealer resets the computer.

Sometimes this problem is accompanied by the engine running roughly, sometimes not.

Apparently, this is a common problem, because we have discussed it with other drivers that are having the same problem repaired in the waiting area.

The dealership has not acknowledged a general problem, and tells us that we should be more careful to tighten the fuel cap after filling- we are now extremely careful about this, but we still this recurring issue. 

Sometimes when this occurs, the dealership insists that the car be towed to their site rather than driven.  Sometimes they ask us to drive it in.

This problem has destroyed all of the good will we felt for this car.  We are considering invoking our state's lemon law.  I do not wish this experience on anyone.<br><br>
