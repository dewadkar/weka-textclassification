            Digital cameras are very much like computers by now- wait six months and you brand new camera will be topped and out-featured by the new release.  But much like my computer, I want something that works well, is dependable, and gives me what I need.  In this case, I want an easy and convenient camera that takes good pictures.  The Olympus D-490 Zoom is ideal because not only does it give me what I want, but it didn't cost a ridiculous amount as well.

First and foremost I should mention a couple of elements that are always talked about when addressing digital cameras and that I needed to keep in mind while shopping around.  Said elements are megapixels and storage.

Megapixels: By now, digital cameras are coming out with 4+ megapixel cameras for around $1000 dollars.  I'm sure in 5 years they'll be $300, just like 2 megapixel cameras went through not so long ago.  "Megapixels" are essentially the number of pixels that make up your pictures, and the higher the number of megapixels, the more fine/detailed your pictures are.  1 megapixel cameras are the flashbulb wind-up cameras of the 21st century to your average store clerk by now, and though I'd like to think the 2.1 Olympus D-490 Zoom isn't yet, it probably will be in no time.  BUT unless you're a forensics detective charged with analyzing evidence photos, the 2.1 megapixels crank out huge, gorgeous pictures that will suit any occasion.  I've seen higher-quality cameras' results and yes- they are better, but only in the same way platinum is "better" than gold.

Storage: There's different ways to save your pictures in memory to place on your computer.  Some take regular 3.5 inch floppy discs, Sonys take their special memory sticks, and several take SanDisk's SmartMedia cards which are a little smaller than two postage stamps yet store a LOT more than the floppy kind and are much more common than Sony's specialized memory storage system.  The D-490 Zoom comes with an 8M card and you can purchase larger ones for a semi-expensive price, but keep in mind (for this and all purchases concerning this camera) that if you count enough pictures, you WILL end up saving money if you consider all film and developing purchases you won't ever bother with again.

Incidentally, for more information concerning both of these slightly tricky elements and several others you really should give thought to before buying a digital camera, seek more information on the 'net, or what I did, which is study the large article in a semi-recent Consumer Reports magazine that greatly helped me out.

As for the camera itself, I've been very happy with it.  It does crank out high-quality pictures.  You can use the typical view-finder (which saves power) or the screen built into the back.  It has a convenient flash with several options (anti-red eye, long distance for darkened scenery, even "long distance anti-red eye").  I can scan all pictures as soon as I take them, take multiple shots if I think one hasn't come out well and delete any that didn't, and best of all can take countless stupid, innane, and goofy pictures that I normally would've never "wasted film on."  It has a nifty little zoom that can also be set to digital though to be frank I've heard negative things about digital zoom so it's at the end of the list of things I've yet to learn about the camera.  And that leads me to one of the only drawbacks...

With so many options comes a rather complicated on-screen menu.  And it displays on menu while the camera's on and another when off which can be confusing.  But my opinion is that you have to take the bad with the good- you could have less complex menus with a camera that has less functionality.  While pointing out the negatives, the D-490 Zoom does not include an AC adapter, nor does it have a USB connector.  Also, regular AA batteries aren't supposed to be used with it- there's a special kind designed for high-end electronics which I didn't know until I had already purchased it.  Finally, the only way to turn off the camera is to close the sliding door but it's dangerously close to the telescoping lens which makes me wonder if they could have designed it a bit better.  Otherwise, I'm completely out of "Cons" but I'm being purposefully critical.

Finally, I AM a big believer that this camera will pay for itself after I take enough pictures with it.  I "splurged" on this purchase, buying the camera on sale but also buying special rechargable batteries made for digital cameras, the recharger, and a "FlashPath" SanDisk floppy disk adapter to make transferring the pictures from camera to computer infinitely easier.  (That's the next critique I'll crank out.)  All together it cost me around $650.  I figure that after 1000 pictures the camera will have paid for itself.  I've only had it for less than two months, and it's already 1/5th of the way there.

Considering everything, the Olympus D-490 Zoom is a great product.  It's dependable, solidly built, offers loads of functions and fun to use.  It deserves a solid four stars and definite consideration if you're thinking of buying a digital camera.  And for the freedom and fun digital cameras offer, the entire concept deserves a gleaming five stars.
