            I decided to replace my 1991 Honda Accord with another Japanese car. It was a toss up between the Honda Accord or the Toyota Camry. As I had a rebate of $2000 from Toyota, I guess that it had to be the choice. After putting in the order for the Vehicle, as it was not on any floor, they first told me that the seat color was not available and I had to choose another. Then this one had a built in child seat. No problem as they were going to offer it to me for free. Also I did request that the vehicle have day light running lights. No problem they assured me. The car arrived and after driving it around a few days, I realised that it did not have day light running lights. Not a major problem, but I could live with it. The second problem I had with it, was when I went to Home depot and and bought some 8 foot lumber, thinking that I had split seats and access to the trunk, I found to my amazement that the split seat 40/60 was not available, only the 40/ side had access. On approaching the salesman at King Toyota, he could not defend himself. All he could say was the seat was offered to me for free. They did not mention that I would loose the full seat fold down option due to the built in child car seat. 
Otherwise the car has done 25 000 miles with no major repairs, just your basic maintenance. It rides very well. It has a lot of pep from the V6 engine. The seats are comfortable, but wish they had a bit more bucket in the the seat. 
The trunk is big, except for the lip which does not allow for boxes to go through the lid, even though they can fit internally in  the trunk. Gas mileage is good for a V6. The arm rests are sticky, due to the plastic, especially in Florida's warm weather. 
Overall I would rate it as a very quite and comfortable car for the average family. The V6 is worth it, especially if you like to have the power and carry 4 people in it. I have numerous Toyota's and never had any major problems, except with the salesmen. They should be educated a bit more as they are selling a supposedly reliable vehicle.
