            The 2001 PT Crusier is an awesome car that never needs to go to the repair shop! It is pretty small but it is so luxurious and the this car has great gas milage. It has a cool look and people stop to look at your car sometimes. It has great lines and is a sport wagon car. The PT Crusier is at a very small price of only 20,000 dollars fully Loaded. These cars are going fast and some places have a wait of 8-10 monthes for the car. Run out right now and make a deal to the Crysler dealer now and you will be very happy when you get the car!<br><br>
