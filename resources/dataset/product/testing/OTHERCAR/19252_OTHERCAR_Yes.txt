             OH, what a week, first a Corvette and now this...I get to be the first to write a review on it!  Here is a little background on my 1993 Corvette.  My father-in-law bought a brand new one in 1993 as a birthday gift for my husbands' 21st birthday.  On the way home from the dealership, his wife convinced him to keep it for himself so needless to say...my husband has wanted one of his own every since.  My father-in-law sold his a couple years ago before his death and it was at a time when we just couldn't afford to buy it.  On top of the expense, we had a baby and as everyone knows it only has 2 seats.

I had always kidded with my husband about wanting a purple Corvette.  He is a lover of all fast cars.  He showed up at my work on a Monday in a 1992 RED Corvette that he was test driving.  I took it for a drive and it just didn't suite me.  I had never owned a used car so I guess my expectations were a little higher than normal.  It just didn't seem clean to me and I wasn't much on the color either.  That night I looked on the Carmax website and found that our local dealer had 2 purple ones.  WOW!!! 

The following Tuesday, we went to look at them and one was already sold.  The salesman said that a used Corvette usually leaves the lot within 3 days.  That is great for resale value on a car.  To make a long story short, we ended up with a purple (actually more of a maroon) 1993 40th Anniversary Edition Corvette.  The mileage was 50,000 and the price was $16,995.00 (before tax, tags, etc.)

Some of the features are CD player, alarm, removable glass roof, leather interior, traction control, suspension package, power everything (windows, locks, seats, etc.), ABS, A/C, automatic climate control, 8 cylinder engine, and speed, power, speed, and more power.  The handling is awesome.  I can go onto the highway on-ramps that I usually do about 40 mph at 60 and don't even feel the difference.  

The radio and speakers are factory stock Bose'. The sound is great and the sound level automatically goes up and down with the roar of the engine so you don't end up stopping at a light with music screaming out at you.  The interior is comfortable once you are inside. The seats seem to hug you with the adjustable side panels.  All of the controls are within easy reach to both the driver and the passenger.  The ride is very smooth compared to most sports cars.  The speedometer is digital as is the display for gas mileage, odometer, trip odometer, and fuel averages.  The display for the inside and outside temperature is also digital and can be set to automatically keep the inside temperature at whatever degree you prefer.  

The only downfall that I have found with my 1993 Corvette is that when we got it the motor on the drivers' seat was shot.  It will go forward and backward but not up and down.  If that is the only problem with it after 7 years then I think this is a great car.  The car came fully inspected with a 30 day warranty and 30 day return guarantee from Carmax.  It is cramped getting in and out even for me and I am 5'3&quot; and 120 lbs. but who cares about getting out when you can just stay in and drive.

The gas mileage is an average of 18.5 miles to the gallon with cheap gas in it.  It should do a little better once we get a higher octane gas through it.  I haven't taken it much faster than 90 mph so far because I am still getting used to the way it handles.  

The 40th Anniversary Editions are far less common than other models so if you are checking into a Corvette, you may want to check on a  40th.  They retain their value better and if you ever decide to get rid of it, you can surely get a good price from any collector.  As you can tell, I am more than thrilled with my 93 Vette'.  Please email me or leave comments if there is anything you think I may have left out.  I am so excited, I just can't think of everything yet. <br><br>
