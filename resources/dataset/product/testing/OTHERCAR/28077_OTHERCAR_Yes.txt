<TEXT>
            I'm a 'car guy', having bought for our family an average of one new vehicle per year for the last twenty years. We've had two Lexus, BMW 528, Audi, Saab, etc. Never dreamed that I'd ever own a Buick, which I considered a geriatric vehicle. However, I was intrigued by the enormous amount of interior space the Rendezvous has, and after three test drives, I was sold. Would you believe I sold my Lexus GS300 to buy a Buick?

I now have 23,000 miles on the Rendezvous, and I would buy it again in a second. The car has a very 'of-a-piece' European feel, holds 50% more than most SUV's, and gets great mileage (19 around town, 21-25 on the road depending on how I drive). The car is absolutely trouble-free, has NEVER been into the dealership (I do my own oil changes...told you I was a car guy). It's very easy to drive around town, very maneuverable, and is also a great freeway cruiser, with wind noise almost nonexistent. I find that I'm less tired after a nine-hour drive than in other vehicles I've owned.

Is it perfect? Of course not. It could use a bit more power (but I wouldn't trade the great mileage for a larger engine), and a 5-speed automatic would make the drivetrain feel more sophisticated. The dash and inside door panels feel kind of cheap (but I was used to the Lexus) and a couple of the interior panels have developed buzzes over very coarse pavement. End of complaint list. Very highly recommended.
