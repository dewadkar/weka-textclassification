            My wife and I have a 1997 Nissan Sentra 4 door GXE 1.6L automatic.  We bought this car for use as a commuter car.  No long trips were intended.  I wish to provide some facts and epinions for people who may be considering this car.

The Sentra has 37K miles and has never had a major repair.  In fact, no warranty claims have been made at all.  That leaves just regular maintenance.  The Sentra has behaved well and sips fuel at the rate of 22 MPG.  The driving experience is controlled, if a little underpowered feeling.  When pushed, the little car accelerates well.  While quite comfortable, the low seating position takes some getting used to. The interior of the car has a lot of storage as well as passenger space.  The truck is quite large and will swallow your materials! 

The Sentra always starts and runs well.  With no modifications to the engine, the car is perfect for flat and non-mountain driving.  I could not recommend the car for use in the mountains.  Perhaps a standard transmission would be more effective in the mountains.

In all, driving the Sentra is fun and the only frustration is the lack of passing ability.  Consider this vehicle if you want great value, dependability and fuel economy.  Pass on the Sentra if you are looking for power and speed.<br><br>
