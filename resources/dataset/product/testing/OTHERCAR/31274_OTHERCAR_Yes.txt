            I have a little blue friend named Nelly.  That's right, Nelly.  Nelly is my 1989 Toyota Tercel.  Some other nicknames for Nelly are The Beast, 130 Plus, and Bluebird.  Let me explain.

My mother had originally given the name Nelly to the car.  This is because the car was her precious little workhorse.  She drove this car like an old woman, though.  This is not how the powerhouse 1989 Toyota Tercel is meant to be driven.

I was given rights to command the starship known as Nelly when I was 16.  This was a fatal mistake.  You should never give a mere kid with a brand new license a drag racing phenomenon such as the 1989 Toyota Tercel.  This is no joke.  I would pile five people into Nelly, which was slowly earning the nickname The Beast, and drive upwards of 110 up 7th street.  The speed limit varies between 35 and 40 on this street, mind you.  Thinking back about driving 2000 pounds of glass and metal passing law abiding sports cars brings tears of nostalgia to my eyes.  It also scares the heck out of my poor mother.  After successfully driving at this rate for about 1 year, I ended up rear ending a big red truck while I was ditching high school.  Hence, The Beast.

However, shortly after that experience, my friend and I were driving home on the I10 after a Cubanate concert.  My friend was driving his dad's Maxima, and swears to this date that his speedometer read 130 and I was outpacing him.  Hence, 130 Plus.  Don't tell the police, ok?

Bluebird simply describes the aesthetics of the car.  It's blue, and covered in the droppings of what must be giant pigeons, or perhaps baby pterodactyls.

I guess to be a bit more on the point, the car has lasted me a long time... It's LY2K (that's leap year) so I guess that would be 11 years.  One other thing about the car, though.  It's loud!  It always sounds like you're driving by a Harley convention!  Nah it's not that bad.
