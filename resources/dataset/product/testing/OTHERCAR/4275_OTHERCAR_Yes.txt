            My father got a bug a little while ago and this baby rocks! It's quick, runs on diesal, and is a smooth ride. It is honestly a GREAT car, whereas most people would think it is just some fancy little novelty that will wear off in a few months. But, since the car is so good, it seems to be here to stay! My father has a manual and has not had ANY problems with the car as of yet.  The contour of the car is surprisngly good but the dashboard is very large. It is fairly roomy and has a nice stereo system too. Yet, VW always seems to have these hard-to-clean seats installed in them. The fabric of these seats are very odd and collect dust, hair and the like very quickly. I hate dirty interiors and it bugs the heck out of me when I get into the car since it is usually dirty looking. But if you don't mind this then the car should be a great addition to your family. The drives are smooth and many people still look at you while you drive by, it's still kind of neat to be sitting inone of these things but again, they are so reliable, its a wonder you never got the bug when it first came out.<br><br>
