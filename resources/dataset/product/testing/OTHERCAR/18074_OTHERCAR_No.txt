            I bought the 1996 Neon 4-Door High Line Expresso in January 1996.  It was the floor model and I was 22.  It was my first brand new car.  I was so excited when I picked it up.  It was a nice looking car, jet-black with sport seats and a spoiler.  

In the first 2 or 3 months I put on about 4000 miles, driving it everywhere and showing it off.  The car was small, light, quick and very fun to drive.  I had the 5-speed which made it even better.  My car came standard with AM/FM Cassette and air. 

After about 3 or 4 months, the newness of the car was starting to wear off and that's when I realized what I had.

I got a recall notice at about the 6 month mark - there was a problem with the wiring that could cause a fire. No problem - most cars are recalled at some point.

It was recalled again.  This time it had something to do with a faulty gasket.

Fine.  I had them both fixed and I was back on the road.  Wait a minute... do you hear that? What was that noise?  A VERY loud noise was coming from my wheel well everytime I made a slow turn or when I was traveling under 5 mph.  

I brought it to the dealer to figure out the problem. "I don't hear anything" said the dealer. "Did you drive it around?" I asked. "Yeah, probably got something stuck in there when driving and now it is free". 

Ok.  Maybe that's what happened. But wait... I hear it again, and it's louder! Well, this went on with 3 dealers for almost a year.  Now they could hear it but couldn't figure it out.  It was so bad that people would turn their heads to see what the heck was making all that racket. 

Embarassing.

Not only that, but I went through brakes, shocks, a gas pump, distributor, many fuses and all the cheap plastic knobs where falling off.

I decided to trade the in the car in November of 1998 after 2 1/2 years.  I had put 35000 miles on it at that time and I felt that it would not last past 40k.

Too bad, because I really tried to like this car.
