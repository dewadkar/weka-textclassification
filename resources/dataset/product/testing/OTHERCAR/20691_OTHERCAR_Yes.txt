                I will admit it I beat my '96 Hyundai elantra SE into the ground, and the sad part is I enjoyed it. The car was great for being my 3rd car, good power, awsome handling and the way it rode....wow! The car was good, it wasn't perfect though, most of the stuff that happened to it was my fault, but what do you expect a 17 year old kid to do to a car?
I absolutely know  that they are not going to drive it responsible there gonna burn out, pull dough nuts, and e-brake specials, and just when the little car thinks it's done being beat up, it will be raced.
    But I was happy with the car, for what I did to it the car held together. Even when I rolled it over three times I came out safe and with out a scratch. I found it kind of odd when the air bag didn't go off, even when I hit the ditch as hard as I did.
     The '96 hyundai elantra has some of my highest regards. It's roomy, safe, and has that little bit of power that young drivers think is exciting. (Even though it only puts out 120HP) Also it gets good gas mileage and the interior holds together well.
    The down part was that the trend for the time was to put as much after market parts in the vehicle as possible, I had trouble finding parts for the car, but the stock original parts where easy to get.
