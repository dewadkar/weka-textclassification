            European luxury at Chevrolet prices is what I got with my 1999 Volvo S80!   Let me start by giving you my frame of reference for comparing this car.  I've owned it for about six months, so I think I know its strengths and weaknesses by now.  I'm leery of the reviews from people who test drive a car for a short period, or the ones who have just bought one a few days before they review it.  Those reviews have value, but I'm not sure they are as objective as they could be.  I'm 49 yrs old, and have owned two Hondas, one Toyota but primarily GM cars throughout my life time.  I'm 6'1", so I like the roominess of the Bonnevilles and Olds 88's I have owned.  

My son and I went to test drive a Passat (too small) and came home with a Certified 1999 Volvo S80 with 35,000 miles on it.  My son took over my 95 Bonneville and I've been driving the S80 for six months.  It is silver with the standard 2.9 Liter engine, moon roof, heated power leather seats, nice stereo with lots of speakers.  The selling point for me was how the steering wheel telescopes out about 2 inches.  With my long legs, some cars feel like the steering wheel is too far away after I put the seat back most of the way.  Also, this car was immaculate and looked almost new.  I could own a European luxury car for the first time, but not spend a fortune on it.  

Generally, it is a very fine car, and does most things quite well.  As I mentioned above, I consider the ride excellent.  It is quiet, handles the bumps well and yet has that road hugging feel and nimbleness that the smaller cars, like my Hondas had.  We test drove a Saab 9.5 before the Volvo, and it has been the only car that really made me smile while driving it.  The Volvo isn't quite as exciting as that, but it is roomier inside and a bit safer on the crash tests.  The acceleration is very adequate for suburban driving, and it has plenty of pick up for entering the highway, or passing on a two lane road.  I've never noticed any torque steer, probably due to a little less low speed get up and go in the Volvo versus our Bonneville, also front wheel drive.  The mileage is very good, about 21 around town and 29 on the highway.  We put the "plus" 89 octane gas in it.  I do NOT wish that I had gotten a turbo charged engine.

The car is well designed.  In addition to lots of airbags, the headrests on the back seats fold down with a push of a button on the dash board to improve visibility.  The floor mats fit over two pegs on the floor to keep them from moving around.  This small feature is actually one of the nicest surprises.  The fold-out cup holder from the center console is the best one since it holds cups and cans well.  The FM radio, CD and tape player truly sound great.  Using the knob system (no push buttons) to change stations is awkward at first, but it is best to use the steering wheel buttons to scroll through the stations.  A nice feature when traveling is to press the "auto" button and it finds 20 local stations that you can scroll through.  The major weakness is the AM radio.  Only people my age and older probably care, but the local ball game or talk radio can be hard to listen to on anything but the in-town radio station.  There is a lot of AM static even when the engine is off.  Our GM cars have vastly superior AM radios in them although for CD's and FM the Volvo sounds better.  (See update at end on the radio.)

The rear seats fold down in a 1/3rd, 2/3rds division, and there is also a pass through door for skis.  My son thinks the rear seats are more comfortable than the front seat, and he is as big as I am.  There is a knob on the center side of each front seat back to adjust the lumbar support.  When I first got it, I thought this would be great, but I am now convinced there is not enough lumbar support even when the knob is turned the full way.  My wife's Aurora has quite a bit more lumbar support, as do other GM cars I've looked at.  The rear seats in the Volvo have better lumbar support, with no adjustment available, than do the front seats.  This is the most disappointing issue with the Volvo.

The trunk is decent sized, but not quite as big as the Bonneville's.  We have put two large suitcases in it, with a couple of small ones.  My golf clubs fit in, but I usually angle them from one corner to the opposite corner. 

The speedometer can be a bit difficult to read.  It goes all the way up to 160 Miles per hour or 240 kilometers per hour.  How many Volvo drivers ever go 160 mph??  This means that the relevant part of the display, the 25 to 60 mph section is condensed into about one and a half inches, so it takes more than just a glance to know if you're keeping within the speed limit.  If it only went to 100 MPH, the relevant speeds would be separated by more space and easier to read.  Most Volvo drivers I know would think 100 mph was fast enough.  The cruise control works well and its easy to adjust your speed after its set. 

One final criticism, the visibility over my left shoulder, when changing lanes, seems a bit restricted.  The B pillar is placed back a few inches from where it is in other cars, and it makes it harder to see around it.  I've put a blind spot mirror on the door mirror and so far I haven't hit anyone.  The front seats have large head rests on them which also make it a bit hard to see when backing up in parking lots.  These head rests are supposed to be extra safe, using Volvo's Whipps system, when you are struck from the rear.  Go to Volvo's web site for details on that.

In conclusion, the Volvo S80 is a nice car.  Its not perfect, but it is enjoyable and comfortable to drive.  Its open for debate whether it is worth the premium price versus domestic cars.  I paid $24,500 versus the upper 30's for similarly equipped new ones.  So far, I have had no problems, and the dealer has been excellent. Being a certified used car, the warranty is extended from the usual four years to six years from the in-service date. 

Added 11/07/02 - I took the S80 into the dealer for its 45,000 maintenance.  The 2003 S80 loaner car they gave me for the day was almost identical to my 1999.  Only a few minor changes.  I turned the source knob on the radio to AM right away to see if this one worked better, and it did.  I called the service manager and told the story and asked that they check out the AM radio.  They replaced an antenna amplifier and that did the trick!  The total bill for my maintenance was $189.  Thats $124 labor and $46 parts, not counting the radio which was covered under warranty.  
  
Seems like an expensive oil change, but I'm not upset about it.  My feelings are it is their job to thoroughly check everything and keep the car working properly.  I'd much rather pay for that than have a belt snap and leave me stranded on the side of the road.  Its too soon for me know if this will be the case, but I think its smart strategy to encourage more maintenance than the GM or Ford dealers do.  It is probably adds to the perception that foreign cars have better quality.  Perception is reality, isn't it?  My annual maintenance costs may not be any lower on the Volvo than my other cars.

Other comments - this car has a great heater, air, and defrost system.  You can just press one button and everything changes to maximize the defrosting of the windows.  Once they are cleared off, you can go back to normal, but this is a great feature when you need it. The windshield visors are too short for when the sun is on your left side and you have seat back.  They need extenders.  Also, I had to buy a cd and sunglasses holder at the auto parts store to put around the visor.  I also put the card key for the parking deck in this.  They should build some of these features into the visor for the price tag of this car.
