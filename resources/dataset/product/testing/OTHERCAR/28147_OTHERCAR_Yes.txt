            I have owned this camera since October 1999. It is a great little camera to have. I was looking to buy a digital camera, but didn't want to spend a LOT of money on one, so this one was really a good find.It takes great pictures and even came with a AC adaptor cord, so I can use it plugged in instead of draining set after set of batteries.
It has a LCD display on it, so you can see the picture as soon as you take it and either delete it or save it to download on your computer.
It also comes with it's own nice little carrying case.Very practical camera for someone who wants to own a digital camera but doesn't want to spend a small fortune.
I would recommend this to friends and family in a heartbeat.<br><br>
