            I bought the olympus C-2000 based on my favorable experiences with the earlier olympus 600L. I had purchased several of the 600L's for work and once word got out everyone was borrowing them. I was able to purchase another to use exclusively and decided to check into the new technology. I purchased the C-2000 as soon as it came out based on many of the trade magazines recommendations. 
I was very impressed with the resolution and picture clarity. Again, I use this camera for work related tasks so it does get plenty of use and has never failed me. I also use it for personal use and have taken quite a few nice family pictures. Whether its indoors or outdoors the photos are excellent! The outdoor shots printed on photo paper can be compared to regular film anyday!
Downloading with the flashpath adapter is just like using a floppy disc and is extremely easy. The nice thing about this compared to the sony mavica cameras is that the smart media cards can hold so much more data than a regular floppy. You'll be amazed at how many photos you can store on a 16mb card!
The camera is much smaller than the 600L which makes it easy to travel with. Just like any other digital camera, I would highly recommend two sets of rechargeable batteries since these things drain them quickly.<br><br>
