            I went into the car-buying arena thinking I wanted an SUV.  The Dodge Caravan changed my mind!  

I test drove a bunch of SUVs and they were fine to drive, but I found them pricey, and quite frankly there is NOT much room in them.  I took a step back, looked at the interiors of these vehicles, and thought, this is just not much bigger than my car!  And what I wanted was a bigger vehicle, because we had a baby on the way and two dogs that often go places with us.  There's just no room in the back of an SUV to stow a Boxer and a Lab so that the baby can have the back seat!  Not to mention baby stuff such as strollers can take up a lot of space.  So we decided the SUVs just weren't going to work for us.

A friend had a Grand Caravan, which we liked very much.  We decided that was what we wanted, until we entered the dealership. We told the salesman we wanted a Grand Caravan, and he suggested we take a look at the Caravan as well, since we were not interested in upscale amenities like leather seats.  The overall size of the Grand Caravan is only 18 inches longer and 6 inches wider than the Caravan. We decided the Caravan was perfect for us, and was quite a few hundred dollars cheaper to boot.  We were able to get many options without breaking the bank. We had our Caravan custom made, and chose to have a CD player and integrated child seats added, as well as power everything and tinted windows.  We also chose the remote keyless entry security system.  The van was delivered from the factory in 3 weeks, just as we had specified.

We have not yet used the integrated child seats since our child is still too young, but I have viewed the enclosed video and will feel very comfortable using them when the time comes.  The seats have a 5-point harness system, which is generally considered safer than 3-point systems, and there is no concern about the seat being installed properly with these seats, which offers welcome piece of mind.  The sound system is of very good quality, and I'm pleased with how easy the CD player is to use.  The Caravan does not offer perks such as climate control in the back seats, leather seats, or an extensive choice of exterior colors and interior cloth designs.  There is a locked box under the front passenger seat, which is a nice place to store your wallet or a small purse out of view.  There is also not a standard console with the Caravan, though you do get a netted area between the front seats which I've found works fine for storing CDs, sunglasses, etc.  The drink holders are large and adjust to the size of your drink.  The climate control system pumps out ample air.  We really love the two sliding doors, which open easily and allow easy access to the backseat.

We find the seats easy to take out and move around, and we generally leave the back seat out to provide more cargo area if we're not planning on hauling a lot of people around.  Without the back seat in, there is a lot of space.....I've managed to fit a stroller, the two dogs, and two weeks worth of groceries back there! When we do use the back seat and cart people around, there is ample leg room for everyone, though the Grand Caravan did seem roomier in that aspect.  The ride is smooth and fairly quiet, though there is some road noise at highway speeds.  The van shifts smoothly and takes corners nicely. 

All around, I've been very happy with this purchase.  We've now owned the car for a year, and have required service once, for a faulty speed sensor.  It was repaired promptly. I would purchase this vehicle again!<br><br>
