            My friend got this for me for last christmas and tried it out, (of course) on his pc first and it seemed really easy to install, but I was a little skeptical everything would work right with the mac, after a little while, after I bought an adapter to convert the com port end to serial, the software and everything installed fine. 
Of course I've saved tons on film developing and since most of the stuff I take ends up on the web, or as burned cd's so this camera was perfect. I started using it right away, and the more I use it, It has great other features, you can turn the flash off, eliminate red eye, adjust the aperature. 
It's not too much to have this camera all the time in my bag, which is when I always catch great stuff. I'm not worried about it being ruined or anything.
It has two resolution sizes 640x480 and 1240x920(I'm pretty sure about that) and these are perfect for just basic stuff, family snapshots get togethers, holidays. It takes a little time to download but thats the serial ports fault. Its b est if you do a lot of downloading just to get one of the smart media card readers, which are much quicker.
I like the smart media cards which are nice, I have an 8mg card which with 640x480 res. can take like 50 or more pictures, but there are a lot of adjustments to the quality of the pics, ranging from basic, normal, fine for detail and the same adjustments for sharpness, combined with the res. size you can get basically any quality pics you could want.
With my job I always end up using it, someone sees it and we use it to email pictures of products to clients, or people in the field. It's worked for me great on a variety of computers, and is very easy to use software.
The screen size is great, you can zoom in and scroll around the image itself. Delete pictures right there or even compress them. But with all digital cameras it goes through batteries like crazy so get some rechargables. the only other complaint is the dial that you chose the modes of the camera with seems a bit flimsy and if it isn't lined up with the arrow it won't work for what function you are trying to use, but rarely. Perhaps in the future this could be a problem with my heavy repeated use.
Overall, its very easy to use, takes great pictures I've used for a variety of things and is inexpensive enough to always throw it in your bag.<br><br>
