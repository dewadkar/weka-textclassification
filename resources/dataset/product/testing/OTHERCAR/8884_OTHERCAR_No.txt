            I had 2 Mitsubishi Eclipse's...the 1995 which was the first year they came out with the new body style....AND the 1998.  Why?  Do you ask...did I  get a 1998 eclipse if I was unhappy with the first one?  Well,I was told that the reason I had problems with the 1995 was because it was the first year they came out with the new model so "problems were to be expected".  I guess I was wrong for being so trusting in my friendly Mitsubishi salesman.
Both of my vehicles were problematic, however, the 1998 Eclipse was even worse than the 1995.  What type of problems?  More like, what type of problems DIDN'T I have.  
The car would be "dead" after any sort of rain or snow...I would go outside to leave for work and it would not even start, I was constantly having it towed.  I went through 2 batteries and 2 head-gaskets (sp?).  

The car door came off in my hand making it impossible for me to get in and out of the car....the cigarette lighter came out of the dashboard (the entire thing) leaving a large hole.  The check engine light was ALWAYS on....and whenever I got it serviced they couldn't find a reason for it.  It remained illuminated until I got rid of it.  The sun roof rattled so bad I thought that one day it would eventually break on my head.  
This car was not worth the money, trouble and did not meet any of my expectations.  I don't think that anyone should get this vehicle without persuing other options.
