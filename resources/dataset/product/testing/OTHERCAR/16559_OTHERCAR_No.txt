            This was my second Jetta, I loved my first.  I would preface this with the warning that my 1991 Jetta was made in Mexico.    I had friends that loved their 1991, mine fell apart.   Make sure it was not made in Mexico!!!!!!!

Maintenance
This is a great car if you are, are married to, date, or would like to date a mechanic.

My Jetta was my first new car.  I should have know when they had to replace the battery so I could drive it home, I was in for a service adventure.   Immediately the gas gauge did not function properly, the gas tank had to be taken apart.  They found a piece of carpet glued to the float in the tank.  Within the first week it would not start, the driver's set belt has to be fasted for the car to be able to start.  The mechanism failed this required it to be towed into the shop.

It constantly was in the shop and for several days.  The parts needed for the cars made in Mexico are not all &quot;standard&quot; Jetta parts.  20% of the time they had to be ordered, which translated to extra time.

Most of the problems were corrected under warrantee.  However I abandoned my car when the items were no longer covered.

Drive
The five-speed manual is very fun and you can take advantage of the German engineering.  The car was fun to drive, it is great fun for car trip with friends.  I always feared breaking down on longer trips and brought friends that looked like good car pushers. 

Visual appeal
It has a nice look that has aged well. It always looked very nice the fit and finish wore very nicely.  The black portion to the bumper I do miss very much.  It shields the paint from scratches.  The sunroof never gave me any trouble.

If you are planing on buying a used Jetta understand where it was made.  I have never talked to a satisfied owner of a Jetta made in Mexico 1991.  I would be surprised if you could find one made in Mexico still running.
