            There is just something about a Corvette.  Even through struggling years, awkward designs and first year bugs for each new body style, a Corvette will still draw a look.  I've wanted one for years, O.K., decades.  I could have bought one a lot sooner, considering how unfashionable it is to be responsible.  The sacrifice financially would have proven too great.  As it is I bought a 1995 rather than a 2000 or an '01.

Let's start with the basics of sports cars.  If you've never owned one, go for a LONG test drive first.  If you like creature comforts and ease of entry and exit, stop right here and get a sedan.  I've owned way more cars than most and a sports car or even a &quot;sporty&quot; car comes with ergonomic comprises.  Car makers love to bill anything with a raked windshield as a sports car and it just ain't so.

All that being said, let's cover the downsides first.  It is next to impossible to get into or out of this car with anything resembling ease or grace.  If you aren't terribly coordinated to start with you may wish to enter or exit this car with no one watching.  It's not a pretty sight.  Well, if you're a gorgeous, long legged woman in a short dress it might be a wonderful sight, but I digress.  Once you swing a leg over the really tall door well, just plop down as quickly as possible into a really comfortable seat.  Lift your other leg into the car and tuck into a narrow foot well with you first leg.  

O.K., now you can actually enjoy the car.  This car surrounds you.  I'm no small guy and this car still feels like it was made for me.  All the controls are in easy reach and you feel like a fighter pilot or an astronaut.  Once in this car you realize that you don't want to get out.  It really is that nice.  I just want to keep on driving and driving.  The top of the door is just a little too high to comfortably hang your arm on for any length of time and that really is a shame.  Whether cruising or chewing up the miles, my left arm just really wants to be up there, elbow to the wind.  Oh well, I'm working on it.

The fully automatic climate control works very well.  Set the temperature you want and it is there before you know it.  A few degrees warmer or cooler is just a couple of taps away.  I found all of the controls very intuitive and well placed.  I would have put the four small analog gauges in a different order though.  The engine temp is next to the bottom, and I've always included that in my scan of the instrument panel.  I suppose it's just a matter of getting use to something different.

The ride is quite comfortable except on the rougher roads, but you shouldn't be driving on rough roads with a sports car anyway.  If you can avoid the occasional (depending on where you live) pot hole, you won't need any trips to the chiropractor.  There is some cowl shake on my model because it's a convertible.  I've never driven a convertible that didn't have some, and the Corvette is definately better than most.  Even with a little cowl shake there are no squeaks or rattles.  That was a pleasant surprise.  I attribute this to the fact that my '95 was in pristine condition with only 27K miles on it.  If it develops noises later, I'll edit this and let you know.

Allright, now what you really want to know.  Yes, it is a VERY fast car.  I have the standard LT1 engine with a four speed automatic transmission.  I wanted a stick, but since I drive this car a lot, including commute traffic, I went with the automatic.  I can't say I'm sorry, it's probably the best automatic I've ever driven.  The response is phenomenally quick and the shifts are nice and crisp without being jack hammer hard.  If you choose to unleash the full extent of the power, watch the road, not the speedometer.  Things start happening way to fast to worry about cops now.  100 mph comes up really fast.  Probably too fast for most drivers.  I don't mean to be a snob, but too many people just don't know how to handle this kind of car.

Cornering is loads of fun, and you'll have to look in the dictionary to find body roll.  If you drive near the edge of the envelope, watch the transition to oversteer.  The back end will come around in a heart beat, so be prepared to counter-steer, and keep a little pressure on the throttle to keep things form getting worse.  If you kick the rear end out in a corner and make the mistake of lifting the throttle, your going to spin unless you have a fair amount of time on a race track.  In all reality though, unless you are driving it like you stole it, you won't find yourself in anything remotely like a tough situation.

When it comes time to stop, this car stops.  The ABS will bail you out if it needs to, but with all that rubber on the road, even four big, meaty disc brakes have a hard time locking up these wheels.  One important caveat here, the big meats that keep you planted on a dry road work against you on a wet one.  It's a simple matter of weight distribution and is the same for any car with big, wide tires.  Ever wonder why cars with skinny tires work well on snow?  There's your answer.

The styling of the Corvette is truly found in the simplicity.  No boy-racer phony spoilers that only add weight. No gim-crack folds and creases that look like something out of a science fiction movie.  Just the graceful, flowing lines of a softly rounded wedge that was made to cheat the wind.  No lavish &quot;Look at ME&quot; badging either.  With the top down, the convertible is a joy to the eyes.  It ain't bad with the top up either.  The fit and finish are very good, which suprises me because GM has never really been known for fit or finish.  The Chevrolet flagship is well put together inside and out.  A look under the hood reminds one of an Indy car.  All things said and done, I just couldn't be happier.  Now if I could just get this stupid grin off my face....

HOT OFF THE PRESS....The 6 month, 5,000 mile review.

Wow, it's hard to believe that I've had this car six months.  It's also shocking to see that I have added 5 grand to the odometer.  Oh well, I bought it to drive it.  Let me give you the downside of living with this car first.

Even though I live in California, I've spent a good deal of time driving with the top up.  Man, this thing has huge blind spots with the top up.  Adjust your mirrors to get the most optimal viewing angle for lane changes.  You CANNOT rely on a glance over the shoulder.  The blind spot created by the equivalent of the C pillar on a sedan can hide an entire midsize car from view.

It's a bit noisier than I would like.  This is a global sacrifice with rag tops, but a little more padding in the top would be nice.  It's a moot point though since this body style is out of production.  Come time for a top replacement though, go for the very best.

My S10 pickup has a much smoother ride than this Vette.  I new going into this that the ride was on the rough side, so I can't gripe too much.  I do find myself paying a little too much attention to road surface ahead rather than the traffic on the road ahead.

Now for the upside.  I'm really just as happy now as when I first bought it.  The handling is still stunning.  Acceleration is orgasmic. Unless I can afford a Vette for nothing but cruising, I'm sold on this automatic transmission.

I like to keep my cars highly detailed.  After splashing about in some rain I was dreading cleaning up the engine compartment.  I didn't need to.  The area under the hood is very well isolated from spalsh and dust.  Better than anything else I've owned by a wide margin.

Fuel economy is really quite good if you are refrain from a lot of hot-rodding.  I've gotten as much as 22 MPG on highway trips doing a steady 85 MPH.  If I'm moderately careful around town, I get 17.5 MPG  Not bad eh?

The car is still solid, and I've put it through some rigorous paces.  Still no squeaks or rattles.  The interior is still very comfy and I have the getting in and out part down pat.  I can even look good doing it.

All in all, I'm one happy camper, and that grin is still on my face! <br><br>
