            I have wanted a Z since the first one came off the line when I moved to California. I have watched the body styles change slightly over the last 30+ years and never fell out of love with my "Datsun". Had an '85 Maxima which was a mover and as close to a sports car as I could get when I was married. But...that was then and this is now. I've owned a huge old MBenz tank, and driven a Ferrari 308 Dino for several months to and from work. I think it was an '82. Yes, boys, it moved and could slap your head back against the headrest getting on the freeway but once in traffic--there was nowhere to go! Talk about cop magnets. I NEVER went over 65. I worked the swing shift at the newspaper and wanted to whomp it on the way home but they'd hear me coming and sure enough, halfway home a black & white would cruise up beside me, stay (admiring, of course) for a mile or so then speed off.

I've had that happen with my Z a couple of times on the way home after midnight but so far haven't gotten a ticket, even though I cruise at about 70mph. I love the way she handles and believe I was saved from a sudden pile up because of the car's responsiveness. It was like we were one and I barely had to think before the car was doing what I wanted it to do. She kept steady and I believe saved me from serious injury. I watched two lanes turn to buning rubber and in the rear view. This car's more than I ever imagined. She's a keeper.

I haven't had expensive repairs so far, my mechanic hasn't found anything wrong and he works on his share of exotic cars. 

Love the natural leather int. The seat felt like it was made for my body, the first time I got in it. I love the way this car responds to my foot on the gas (do need to get the revvs up to really feel the power, it's true). 

My boyfriend bought a '95 black Mustang with the 5 litre engine about a month before I found my car. He complains about his car, now and says mine is so much better to drive. One can feel the solidness and quality. My Chow Chow likes it, too and she's always in the driver's seat. It might be that Asian influence.

Now, I haven't noticed that my car is a chick magnet like so many of you other Z Daddies, even though mine is the color of pearls. Well, I guess you could say this car is a chick magnet after all, it belongs to a soon-to-be 55 year old babe who's driving a 30+ year dream come true.

This is a car for those who know who and what they are and don't have any reason to prove it. With that comes a kind of quiet 'knowing' and when the time comes for power it is there, within us as well as under the hood.
