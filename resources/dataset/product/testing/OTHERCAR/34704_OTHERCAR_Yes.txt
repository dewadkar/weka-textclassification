            We bought my Sonata after our 1985 Cutlass die a terrible death.  My husband had owned a Hyundai in the past and was always looking at them but I was the one that was hesitant. Well I finally broke down and let him purchase this one for me and let me tell you...I HAVE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER.  

Besides some minor repairs here and there, we haven't had any problems with her.  The car rides great and even thought it is a small car there is still plenty of room in the back for my teenage son and daughter.  The gas mileage it gets is great.  We can still go 450 mile on a tank of gas.

  We are definately concidering buying the new SUV that Hyundai has put out as that is what I really want but will keep this Sonata for one of the kids for when they start driving.  For the price and the quality the Hyundai Sonata or any Hyundai's out there are the best there is.  Several of our friends have even purchased Hyundai's after riding in or driving ours.
