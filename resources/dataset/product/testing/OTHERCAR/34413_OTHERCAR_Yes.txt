            I have actually gone and done it. I bought my first car. I will keep this short and simple.


Pros:

Impressive styling
Good fuel economy
Lots of get up and go
Comfortable front seats
Easy to reach controls
Cool interior (the little silver parts look cool)
Excellent Stereo (Clarion Cd)
Neat guages that are well placed
Lots of features for the money (power windows, locks, cd player, etc.)
Good warranty
Lots of places to put stuff (ketchup packs ,speeding tickets :]  )
Handles like a 4x4 in the snow

Cons:

Tiny rear seat
Some people may not like styling
Hyundai has been known for not being reliable (I beg to differ)
Speakers could use a bit more bass
Wider tires

Now, take into affect that I am a rather large guy 6&quot;0 and 200 pounds. I find the rear seat cramped, a smaller person may not think so. I live in Mid-eastern Ontario where 4 and a half feet of snow per year is considered a mild winter, but this car handles well. I'm a racy sort of guy, and this tiburon is well capable of making most Hondas and domestics into shark-bait. But you have to really kick the RPM up high to get the shark to bite. In other words, you have to have the rpm over 4500 to get the power up. I've had the car now for 4 months, and I've had no trips to the shop, excluding 2 oil changes, and a new set of tires (burnout gone bad) and a missing windshield wiper arm. I went through an automatic car wash. Well I'll update this as I go along, until then, look out for a fin on the road.  :)
