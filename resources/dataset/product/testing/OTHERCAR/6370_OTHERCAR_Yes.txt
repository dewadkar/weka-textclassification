            This newly redesigned Monte Carlo offers stylish features reminiscent of the early days. Seen from any angle, the outlines are smooth and well integrated.  Loaded with pep and passing power, the car responds quickly with control, handles well, and brings back fun to driving. The gas saving overdrive creates the combination of performance and economy.

Inside, the road command is enhanced, with a well configured dashboard, ease of use controls, well displayed gauges, room in the front and in the back, and a handy partial of full access pass though to the trunk. And a sound system that brings the music to life.

The designers could have included some additional cupholders, and the center console access is difficult wearing a seat belt.

Overall, this car is made for the commute, or for the country drive. A fine vehicle for both. <br><br>
