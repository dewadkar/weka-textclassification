            I bought my  KIA Sportage  in July 1999.  The reason for choosing this
SUV  was its lower price compared with  other SUVs of this class.
Am I  satisfied  ?    Sofar  yes .
Since purchase I drove  11000 miles without  any  mayor problems .  The car seems to to take me  where I want to go  in a way that I can call uneventful :
 - Average to above average  fuel economy
 - Somewhat rough ride ,  which is what one expects from a low tech  SUV
   and that gives you an  off-the road feeling ( I kind to like it ).
 - Heating / cooling  :  normal
 - Space : normal
 - Nuisances : rear door impossible to close at the first try, you 
   have to get used to it !

Would I  buy  this car again  ?

 - YES  if  I continue to  look for  value at  a  lower  price .
