            Digital camera always have some weak points. It cannot capture picture with high resolution and it's always working good in the day time but not at the night time or where the light is dim.

But when I tried this camera, I think it's worth for to buy. With 2.1 megapixels, I can shoot my little dog and get the most clear and nice picture I've ever took on a digital camera. The camera also provide with good flash, white balance feature and auto zoom function (5x optical, 10x digital) which I think it's much better than the other model or brand within the same price. It can record a short .mpg video with sound too which is 5, 10, 15 seconds long. You can select to zoom manually or automatically. The camera also provide a LED screen that contain picture preview and program menu to customize numerous numbers of  function easily. There are some special effects that you can have fun with such as sepia effect, which will make the picture turned to sepia tone. You can also expand you memory card to up-to 128 mb which is large enough to take more than 50 high-resolution images, I think.

One problem that I met is about the USB port and Windows 2000. I cannot find the driver for Windows 2000 and I don't see any support on Sony website. Anyway, I found the camera works well on Windows 98.

I've got an e-mail from a member asking more details about this camera. After I's using it for a while I found more features and eliminate some problems. I write it down here:

Greeting,

For your question, I guaranteed that the Sony cybershot is really cool and you'll feel really satisfy with this camera like I do. 8-) Now I can get the pictures to Windows 2000 through my serial port so I don't have any complain with it anymore.

The camera also have some advance functions for you to play with. For example, you can adjust the exposure of the picture from -1.5 EV to +1.5 EV. You can adjust your flash's lightness by 3 levels. You can play with effects. The more I played with it, the more capability I discovered. I also suggest that you should buy higher capacity memory card cause you can shoot more pictures while your battery remains. I'm using a 64 Mb memory card and I can shoot around 100 pictures while the memory can stay for about an hour at a time. I can take more but I don't want to wait for a long download from the camera to my computer so I stopped I think you cannot find something like this in the other camera with the same price. ....
