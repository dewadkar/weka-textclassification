            I'll be the first to admit that Nissan isn't my first choice for a car to swoon over. Not like I have anything against the fine motor corporation, nor do I own any sort of window dressing with Calvin besmirching the Nissan logo. I've just never had any significant exposure to Nissans and I've harbored no intentions to change. I own a Toyota, my father owns a Toyota, and enough of my friends own Hondas to comfortably reach my quota of Japanese cars to be concerned about. I don't need a third company to exhaustively pore over, when there are much more exciting vehicles made in certain European nations. That said, I can't stop gushing about the new Nissan Sentra SE.

<b>Competition Driven</b>
Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Mazda Prot�g�

<b>Competition Not Driven</b>
Ford Focus, Volkswagen Golf/1.8 GTI

You must always keep in mind the class of car we�re talking about: a small compact sedan, no matter how Nissan tries to market something else. Keep the fuel economy high, and the expectations low.

<b>Exterior Styling</b>
Whatever you might think about small sedans, Nissan does a great job of raising the bar. Although the new Sentra will not win glamour awards for industrial design, Jerry Hirshberg of Nissan did quite a bit to improve on the drab looks of previous Sentra models. It might even surpass the ho-hum looks of other cars in its class; sharper and more refined than the tired Honda Civic, more exciting than the stodgy Toyota Corolla, sleeker than the Mazda Prot�g�, and appropriately less radical than the rather ugly crystalline Ford Focus. The 2000 is rounder and more shapely than any of the Sentra predecessors and far more attractive than its big brother, the grotesque Altima. Plus, the five-spoke alloy rims give the aluminum frame additional class.

<b>Interior styling and amenities</b>
<b><i>Pros</b></i>
I liked the firm bucket seats up front, although the upholstery seemed a little cheap. I was reasonably comfortable over the course of a long trip, both in the driver�s seat and in the front passenger. The left foot pad is very comfortable. I liked the four cup holders, the extra little storage compartments for knick-knacks, and the dual AC adapters up front. The air conditioning system was powerful and quick to cool down a hot car (a black car, no less!). I liked the little touches like the leather wrapped steering wheel (only on the SE), the brushed aluminum shift column (this car was an automatic), the two-toned dashboard hard plastics, and the titanium-faced gauges. One minor complaint about the gauges; during twilight, when you switch on your lights as darkness comes, the dials are a little hard to read, sort of like white on white. Other than that, it's a nice sporty touch.

<b><i>Cons</b></i>
In addition to the aforementioned quibbles, I didn't like how the far left and right air vents didn't have a rocker switch to turn it completely off and on, which can be a pain if your passenger likes a very different climate. I also found the power side mirror adjusters to be very awkward and confusing, as well as flimsy. Some of the interior upholstery is cheap, like the ceiling and the visors.

<b>Driving</b>
Driving the Sentra SE was a blast. You get a 145 hp @ 6400 rpm, 2.0 L 16 valve inline 4 cylinder engine that gives you 136 ft-lbs. of torque @ 4,800 rpm, virtually the exact engine in the new Infinity G20. Where the G20 engine is rather underpowered for the deceptively heavy frame, it's just about perfect for the 2,700 lb. Sentra. Even with the automatic transmission you take off briskly from a standing start. The transmission shifts cleanly down the gearbox, as the engine gives you a satisfying roar instead of the mouse-like whine of the Civic or Corolla. On steep hills, you tend to strain a little, but downshifting at the appropriate moment can restore some of the lost kick. But where the Sentra really sings is on the curves, what with its sporty suspension and 15 inch tires. Handling was tight and controlled; I felt little body sway on even some of the sharpest turns I attempted (I wasn't permitted to do anything too crazy, as this was a brand new car, and I wasn't the owner). Coupled with the 145 horses, this car was <b>fun</b>, very much like the nimble Prot�g�, except with noticeably more power. My biggest gripe was the trade-off for the agility; the rough and bumpy ride. On moderately gravely highway, I could feel nearly every bump and divot we passed over, often along the back of my seat, which tended to vibrate like a shiatsu massager at high speeds (over 75 mph). I can only imagine the terrible ride of the SE with the optional performance package that features an even tighter suspension (although it comes with racing seat upholstery, which may be designed to absorb the jitters, although that's pure speculation). Ride noise was surprisingly quiet for a small car; far better than the noisy Civic. However, as the Sentra's standard four speaker, CD-in-dash stereo system was subpar at best, it's hard to enjoy the quiet unless you upgrade your audio.

<b>Why the SE over the GXE?</b>
Unless you absolutely cannot spring for the price tag of the SE (dealer invoice of $13,624, M/T) over the GXE (invoice of $12,343, M/T), consider the following: You will be hard pressed to find the GXE without the optional convenience package (includes rear 60/40 split seats, cargo net, keyless entry, and second AC adapter) for an extra $131, nor would you want to do without it. The SE throws all that in the sticker price, making the difference between the two cars only $1150. What do you get for that extra 1150? The 145 hp engine of G20 fame, up from 126 on the GXE. The sportier suspension (good or bad, you choose). 15 inch alloy wheels and tires, up from the 14 inch plastic wheel covers and tires of the GXE. 4 wheel disc brakes, as opposed to the front disc/rear drum of the GXE. Fog lights. And the cool titanium faced gauges and leather wrapped steering wheel (and shifter too, for the stick). My money says it's worth the extra thousand and change, but that's up to you and your budget. It also keeps it right in line with some of the leading, amply equipped competitors, like the Civic LX (which has less horsepower than the horse-like Toyota Echo!), Corolla LE, and the Prot�g� LE. This car I drove was purchased from carorder.com for a couple hundred below dealer invoice, so a good deal on this brand-new model is very possible.

<b>Parting Thoughts</b>
Now, the Sentra isn't a perfect car by any means, but it's a significant contender in the &lt;15K small sedan market. The 2000 model is a leaps-and-bounds improvement over the previous installments, but should retain the most coveted feature: the legendary Nissan reliability. If you're keen on a Corolla or Civic, give the new Sentra a test drive, as well as the Prot�g�, Focus, or any of the VW models if your wallet is deep enough. But if you were to opt for the Sentra SE, even the GXE, you can be certain you could do a lot worse.
