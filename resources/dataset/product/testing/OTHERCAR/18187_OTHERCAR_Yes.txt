            We had owned our Pathfinder almost 2 years, drove it cross-country more then once. We had clocked several thousand off road miles, and had never had anything bad happen to us. Never stuck, never left on the side of the road. On May 13th, 1999, we were heading to a good friends wedding when all hell broke lose. We were somewhere in North Carolina when it began to rain heavily, and before we knew it we hit a puddle of standing water and hydroplaned, spun 180 degrees, and clipped a guard rail. We clipped the rail at just the point on the Pathfinder to cause a yo-yo action which in turned flipped the Pathfinder, nose to tail, landing heavily on the passenger side, twice, coming to rest on itï¿½s top, wheels to the sky like an over turned turtle.

My husband, who was driving, was able to get out of the vehicle right away and come help me out through the window.  We both walked away with a few bruises. Considering the speed and weather conditions I think we are very lucky and we owe our lives to Nissan. Pictures our Pathfinder remain a testimonial, and yes, we did replace the vehicle with a new Pathfinder.
