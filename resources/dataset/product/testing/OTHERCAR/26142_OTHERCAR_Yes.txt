            As a regular business traveler, I spend a lot of time in rental cars. On a recent trip to Chicago, I ended up with a Hyundai Sonata LX. I was so impressed with the car that I felt obligated to share my opinion here.

First of all, when I arrived at Hertz and climbed into my car, I didn't even pay attention to the make or model. It was white, had four doors, and was sitting in the #1 Club Gold spot near where I got off the Hertz shuttle bus. What else did I need to know?

Anyway, I tossed my two bags into the trunk, with plenty of room to spare. I jumped into the driver's seat, checked over my contract, adjusted the seat and mirrors, and headed for the rental car exit. As I sat in line waiting to leave the parking lot through security, I started changing radio stations. That's when I realized that the interior was all leather. This made me start looking around a little more, and I was suddenly sure that I had been upgraded to one of the "Prestige Collection" cars, like an Infinity or some other classy car. I remember thinking, "Cool, this frequent traveler stuff is finally paying off".

However, as my turn came to show my driver's license and contract to exit the parking lot, I saw something odd on my paperwork. There at the top in bold letters it said "Hyundai Sonata". That's when I noticed the oddly shaped "H" on the steering wheel.

<i>What??!! Excuse me, Hertz - Did you say "Hyundai"?! You mean this isn't a luxury car and I haven't been upgraded?</i>
 
I was completely shocked! How could such a nice car with so many features possibly be a Hyundai? It had all leather seats, a nice stereo with built in CD player and an equalizer, a console with an automatic/shiftronic shifter (like in my Lincoln LS), and plenty of room. Amazing!

Still being a skeptic, I passed through the security checkpoint and drove to the highway entrance. I thought to myself - OK, it looks nice, but what about performance? Again I was impressed. The Sonata LX with V6 engine has a little "growl" to it when you get aggressive with the accelerator, and the response is quick and solid. I quickly took my place in Chicago traffic and was keeping pace with surrounding traffic immediately upon entering the highway. No lack of power, that's for sure.

As I cruised along down the highway, I kept thinking how wrong I had been about Hyundai cars. My impression was that they were inexpensive and lacked style or power. The Sonata LX obviously had plenty of both and completely changed my perception.

The ride was nothing short of luxurious. It's smooth and quiet, with no wind noise and barely a whisper from surrounding traffic. Truthfully, I thought the car was an Infinity when I first got into it, and I have a hard time imagining an Infinity being any more silent.

The V6 engine is quiet, but sounds great during rapid acceleration, like it's just been waiting for you to step on the gas. Acceleration is solid and steering is very responsive. Overall, it's fun to drive and feels like you're driving a much more expensive car.

The interior is loaded with extras, like a central console with shifter and plenty of storage space, including a closable compartment housing two cup holders. There's also a little flat tray-like compartment closer to the driver's feet, with a rubber surface. I found this an excellent place to keep my change for the many Chicago tollways. The top of the console is constructed to be a comfortable arm rest and opens in several places to provide a couple of different storage areas. The seats are very comfortable and easily adjust, with top quality leather in the model I drove. The dashboard and gauges are arranged in a very user-friendly manner, making everything accessible and easy to view. In short, this vehicle is designed with the driver in mind.

Overall, I was totally blown away by the quality and luxury of the Hyundai Sonata. It's forever changed my perception about Hyundais. 

I highly recommend anyone looking for top value for the least money in a new car to look at Hyundai.
