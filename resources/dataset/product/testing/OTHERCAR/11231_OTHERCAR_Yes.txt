            Took delivery two weeks ago of GL automatic w/o sunroof..absolutely love the way this car drives..I have had Mercedes and BMW..this diesel engine has such pep..if it had not been for objection of my husband I would have chosen the stick shift..I drove one..what a trip.

Due to some of the negative reviews I read on the net, I chose to get extended warranty to 100 thousand..if you read fine print, don't know if transmission is even covered..have heard service is poor for Volkswagen and parts expensive.  Explore the dealerships reputation before you buy..since tdis are hard to find..the dealerships can  trade cars with other dealerships to get the color you want.

My brother bought the same car at a dealership which did not treat him with much respect and they quoted much more for the extended warranty than I got mine for..my dealership has an excellent reputation in the area; this was very important to me.  He is going to look into getting the same extended warranty as I did for same price..warranty can be obtained until the car goes over 6000 miles.

The miles per gallon is amazing..average about 40 miles per gallon, but that is around town and highway with an automatic..this car is LOTS OF FUN!!

Inside finish is very clean..love blue dashboard lights..easy to see.

I feel this is an amazing value for the money..when you slam the door the car is very tight and solid.

I would not get any Jetta but the TDI because many of the gas models are assembled in Mexico..this one was assembled in Germany and all parts are German.

I am in my fifties and really thought Volkswagens were cars for college kids..well, maybe they are and maybe they aren't..but when I drive it I feel alive..so that is a good thing isn't it???
