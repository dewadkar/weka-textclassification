            What a great SUV.  When looking for a new vehicle, I was kind of afraid to get into an SUV, being short and this being much bigger than a car, I was a little concerned.  My husband and I test drove other SUV as well and vans and then test drove the Pathfinder.  Well I fell in love.  The ride is so smooth and the Pathfinder is so roomy and comfortable. 

We wanted a bigger car because we wanted to start a family and this was the car we choose, not only is there a lot of room behind the back seats, but the back seats fold down so easily.  

Another concern was how our dog, Lindy, our babygirl, would get into it.  Well the saying is true, &quot;DOG'S LOVE TRUCKS&quot;.  

We have another 1 1/2 on our lease and we are definitely considering buying this one or getting another.

I highly recommend the Pathfinder not only for looks, but for comfort and a great ride.<br><br>
