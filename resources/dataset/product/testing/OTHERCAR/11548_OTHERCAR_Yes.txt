              After seventeen years of constant production, the Cherokee's design has been consistent.  The tweaks, and cosmetic additions (not to mention the applied safety innovations that have come along since 1984) have combined to refine the basic formula.  The price is a bargain, and this classic can be offered for so little because so little has been spent.  Chrysler never needed a major retooling.  There are, however, great differences between the various flavors of Cherokee over the years.  Once, you could have bought a tepid 4-cylinder, 2x4 version that served only to besmirch the &quot;aura&quot; of Jeep.  Today, the latest iteration (and final before the major revamp that is planned for the Cherokee), represents the best of breed.  I previously owned an '89 Cherokee (bought used), which faithfully served me for five years before I bought my '99 Cherokee Sport.  The previous car ran through over 170,000 miles, and after nearly 20,000 miles clocked on my '99 I expect to meet or exceed the previous model with my new Cherokee.  There are certain idiosyncracies to be conscious of with any 6-cyl Cherokee (O2 sensor comes to mind) with some miles on it, but I would rank the Cherokees as above-average for reliability.  Ride comfort is relatively weak.  Other SUV's on the market offer a smoother ride, whilst the Cherokee doesn't mind sharing the road surface with it's passengers.  It's also relatively smaller than most of it's SUV brethren, which is a plus for urban parking as well as off-road rock scaling (shorter wheelbase is a good thing for dirt riding, but a bad thing for long-distance highway trips).  My '99 comes with the standard part-time 4-wheel drive with requisite low gearing, although full-time 4wd is available.  The updated interior is, in my estimation, worlds better than the previous model.  It's feels &quot;tighter&quot;, and the creeks and rattles are minimal after a year.  There is noticeable road noise, which can partly be attributed to the Goodyear Wranglers fitted.  Power is supplied by the 4.0-liter six which has been present in the line since the beginning.  Acceleration is excellent (one of the reasons I opted for the Cherokee over the used LR Discovery I was eyeing at the time), and handling (especially turning at speed) is much more confident than the Explorer.  I've been fortunate enough to ride this Cherokee off-road (not very technical trails, admittedly), and the Cherokee is like &quot;old faithful.&quot;  Predictable performance, with legendary capability.  The inside capacity hasn't changed, and provides serviceable room with the rear-seats folded, providing an un-interrupted flat service on which to fit cargo.  I would recommend this machine to anyone who needs a vehicle that can fit many roles well...<br><br>
