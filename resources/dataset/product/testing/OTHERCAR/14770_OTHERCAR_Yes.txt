            My husband and I purchased our Mountaineer used, with 47.000+ miles.  I was not gung-ho on the idea of a &quot;sport-ute&quot; because I'd been driving a Saturn SL1.  I thought the &quot;truck&quot; would feel to big and bulky, and I was going to be the primairy driver.  We test drove several &quot;sport-utes&quot;, crossed off several for lack of back seat space, comfort, &amp; look.  The Mountaineer was by far a better ride over it's sister truck the Ford Explorer(yes even the Eddie Baure edditions), and the other big name sport-ute producers.  We live in Minnesota, so having the all wheel drive was nice, especially since we purchased in mid-Feb.  Within a week of signing papers I did a 360 on icy roads, but the truck held on came back around and the whole time I felt very in control.  The size difference was an easy transformation, and I'm happy to say the truck now fits me like a glove(the way I thought my car had).  Buying a used vehicle is always a little scary, because you don't know what problems you may be getting yourself into.  I must say though this truck of ours has done wonderfully in the year that we have had it.  I put a lot of miles on my vehicles, and expect them to perform well for me, and this truck has deffinatly outdone my expectations.  I absolutely LOVE my truck.  I would Deffinatly buy another one, infact I hope to buy one brand new next time.  Now I don't think I could ever switch back to a car!!!<br><br>
