            I have been in love with the Impreza for years. In fact, I researched this car for about two years before I actually went out and bought it. I considered many factors and tried to find the "perfect car" under $25k. I came to the conclusion that nothing can compete with the Impreza. More specifically, I'm referring to the 2.5RS. This was their top of the line model in 2000 and included many features unavailable or optional in lesser trim levels like ABS, 4 wheel disc brakes, 2.5L engine, sunroof, etc. 

This car is packed with features that no rivals can match. That is, it's got AWD, a flat-four engine (allowing a lower center of gravity), passive rear wheel steering and sport tuned suspension with plenty of travel for off road excursions. The AWD is truly remarkable! When it rains it feels like I'm still driving on dry pavement. I have never slipped the tires in this car, even when it's wet! Thanks to the AWD and low center of gravity, this thing corners like no other, as if it's on rails! Obviously this is a driver's car so the deficits in internal trim pieces and stereo (don't bother with the premium system, it's crap too)take a "back seat". However, you can sleep easy knowing that the bulk of the car's sticker price went to what's underneath the sheet metal to make a durable, dependable all weather performance vehicle. After all, most stock stereos suck anyway and you're better off buying aftermarket equipment.

In all, I can't say enough good things about this car. Unfortunately, Subaru has further contributed to indecisiveness in this country by bringing the turbocharged WRX as a 2002 model. What a dilemma, it's either a naturally aspirated or turbocharged rally car for the people. You decide.
