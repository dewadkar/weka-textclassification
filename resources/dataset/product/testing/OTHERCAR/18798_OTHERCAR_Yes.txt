                 Man, I love this car! We bought this vehicle for two main reasons, to carry product for my husband, who is a salesman, and to allow our GIANT dog to ride comfortably with us wherever we go.

     The Jeep has never let us down. We have had our Cherokee since 1998 and other than oil changes, and new tires, has not been in the shop since we bought it. The Jeep Cherokee while not being inexpensive to purchase, is not overly priced, and stays right up there with all the other SUV's.

     When it comes to carrying cargo, this vehicle is a dream. The back seat easily folds down to make more cargo space, and the carpet covered area is easy to clean. From light fixtures to Bernese Mountain Dogs, our Cherokee hauls them all very safely and easily.

     If you are looking for a very smooth ride, SUV's may not be the vehicle for you. The Cherokee with it's short wheel base is especially &quot;buck-boardy&quot;. Long trips may leave you feeling a bit jostled, but when we travel in our Jeep, we are out for an adventure. If we wanted a smooth, luxury ride, we would have bought a four-door sedan.

     If you are an active family with doggies and kids and all the equipment that goes with them....this Jeeps for you! I wouldn't be without my Jeep for anything!<br><br>
