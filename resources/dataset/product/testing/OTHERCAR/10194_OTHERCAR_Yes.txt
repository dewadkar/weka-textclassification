            I do not actually own this car, but my boss has one and I have driven his before.  I used to drive an ES 300 (sedan) Lexus and I LOVED it!  Lexus is one of the best cars I've ever driven.

This SUV and the ES 300 are very similar in feel.  The RX 300 doesn't feel at all like an SUV.  It has an extremely smooth drive and easy turning radius.

It also has a comfortable interior.  Obviously it's a smaller SUV than some others, but the interior room is not bad for its size.  The front seats are definitely pletty spacious and even the back seat is too.  However, I did not get a look at the trunk space, so I don't know if it's very spacious or not.  But all around, I think this SUV is wonderful!  Especially for women who might be afraid to drive a large, truck-like automobile!         <br><br>
