            Talk about getting your moneys worth!  Honda has done it yet again, this time in the form of the 2000 CR-V.  My sister has just purchased a Red CR-V EX, and after having gone through a harshly warm summer and an icy/freezing cold winter, you can easily see the line between a Honda and most other cars out there.

The CR-V not only takes what you throw at it, it even makes you sigh with car-love.  It has a lot of room on the inside (front and back), it's very easy to drive, the stereo is adequate, and the cloth seating material is very comfortable.  The car also comes with power windows, though it's unfortunate that power seating isn't available (at least not at the EX class).

One downside is the power.  It's fine for city driving, as it'll certainly get you going off the line fast enough so you can be first in line at the mcdonald's breakfast line up.  But as far as pure motoring goes, this engine is weak and noisy.  You can hear every little infliction you place on the pedal, and sometimes the grunt isn't worth the end-result speed.

But still, this is a great car at a great price.  Fantastic value.<br><br>
