            What a Vehicle!, I must say I am very impressed with our recent purchase of a Toyota 4Runner. Back in May my husband and I decided that it was time to get another &quot;new-used&quot; vehicle. We had SUV in our minds with our growing family, currently we have a toddler and I am pregnant with our 2ND child. Also we needed a vehicle that would accomodate my husbands 6'2&quot; height. One day we went looking for a vehicle, because with my husband starting a new job his current vehicle at the time would not make the long trip to and from work. We ended up trading vehicles, so to speak. I would get the new vehicle and he would get my car. So out we went, and after looking at a few dealerships we came across an 1995 4Runner in excellent condition.

At first I had aprehensions, but after test driving it I was in love. It doesn't feel like driving a huge vehicle, like some SUV's. I like that it was a leased vehicle with the previous owner, it only had 54,000 miles on it, which is wonderful. It was well taken care of, and after a few hours at the dealership, we ended up trading in my husbands 1988 Mirage for it.
Being a young couple we were first overwhelmed with just buying our first car together. But we are very satisfied with the 4Runner.

Here are a few things I like about the 4Runner:
-Excellent room, for a family soon to be 4 there will be enough room to be comfortable, and for luggage when on family vacations. Also it helps that it accomidates my husbands size.

-The Gas mileage is better than you would think, I get around 20 miles to the gallon. Which as we all know with the way gas prices are these days, it helps not to have to spend a fortune on gas. 

-It does handle nicely when driving, wether it be good or bad weather. I feel very secure in it, which to me is a big plus.

-The overdrive feature is nice to have.

-I love the sporty but family look of the vehicle itself.

The only downfall I found with the 4runner, it when going up steep inclines it does lose acceleration which if your like my husband, he uses up more gas trying to go faster up the incline than I do. But then all vehicles lose some degree of acceleration.

Overall If I had to choose again which vehicle to buy again, I would choose the 4runner again.<br><br>
