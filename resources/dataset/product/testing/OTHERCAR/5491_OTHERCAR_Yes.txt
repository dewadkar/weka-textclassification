            The STI is a hard core rocket ship.
I owned an '02 WRX wagon for 18 months and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I eventually modified it to "stage 4" with new turbo, bigger injectors, fuel pump, 3" exhaust, engine management computer, bigger intercooler.  

That car, entertaining as it was, didn't come close to the STI.  The STI is more of ...everything.  
Power - 300hp and 300 lb-ft of torque delivered at much lower RPM's than the already impressive WRX. The STI shoves you around with the torque of a hi-power V8.  Driving in the mountains in New Hampshire, the car blows past other cars in passing zones, uphill, with essentially no effort. The added low end torque makes starting off super easy. Torque.  Gobs of it.  
Brakes - unbelieveable, stunning braking power combined with toe-tip modulation.  Huge 4-piston Brembos front, 2-piston rears on 13+ inch wide, extra-thick rotors, plus Electronic brake force distribution and upgraded ABS from the regular WRX.  Hard stops make your head throb from the g-forces.  
Drivetrain - The STI has a 6-speed short-throw gearbox that is dramatically strengthened over the WRX 5 speed unit. The STI has a driver-adjustable front/rear center differential, added to rear AND front limited slip diffs. 
Handling - alloy control arms in front, thicker section struts, stiff springs and shocks, big roll bars, forged BBS 17" rims, and autocross-ready summer tires make the car stick like glue.  That being said, I can induce tail-out powerslides on dry pavement and control it with confidence.  Throw on all-seasons, and the car romps like a playful kid in deep, slippery snow.  Do endless perfect donuts in parking lots like a grinning fool. The only minor downside is mid-turn, lift-throttle wiggles caused by torque reactions in the front LSD.  Just anticipate it, hold the wheel steady, and drive through it.
Styling - Much better than before.  Goofy bugeyes are gone, sleek modern face in it's place.  I get lots of people asking about my car.  Cops take notice, too.  They follow me around, perhaps hoping I'll do something stupid.  Cops stopped me about my muffler being loud.  I carry the factory brochure with me to prove it's stock.
Ride - Stiff.  About 2 hour drive is all I can take without a break.  Comes with the territory.
Gas - Eats it.  Lots of it.  Can dip to 14 mpg under a heavy foot.

Overall, the STI is not for everyone.  It is a hardcore vehicle.  My old WRX felt like a rocket compared to my Accord, and the STI feels like a rocket over my old WRX.  My STI was $29K, $6K more than my WRX.  Worth every penny.  I parted out all the go-fast parts I invested in for my WRX and nearly paid the difference. 

my 5 year old daughter loves to "GO ZOOM!!" in it!
