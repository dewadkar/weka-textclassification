            I have sat here tonight and read EVERYONE'S reviews, so now I feel I must give mine, and tell my story. My very first car when I turned 16 was a 1976 souped up Black Chevy Camaro with an Edlebrock racing engine. I loved that car more than life itself. But lack of a job, forced me to horde my lunch money for gas. That was never enough so my parents decided to sell it and I got a 1985 Red Ford Tempo. It was my dad's car prior, then I got it. I had it for about 3 years then traded it in for a 1985 Ford Bronco II. Didn't like that much. Then I had a Buick Century (it was free) then I traded that for a 1990 Blue Ford Tempo. I am telling you this so you can see I have had a nice variety of differnt brands of cars. In August of 1998 I know it was time to trade in the Tempo and search for a new car. I am a college student who barley gets buy every month so a used car with low payments was my only option. All I wanted was another Camaro. But with those payments I may as well just buy a bike to ride on campus. Then one day I saw the new Pontiac Trans Am. I liked it more than the Camaro, and thus began my search. I looked through magazines, went to car auctions, and just about every car lot in my state. None of them could get me the car I wanted on my budget, not even used. So it was back to the bike rack for me. But, then a miricle happened. I was reading a magazine in October of 1998 and I saw a ad for the new Sunfire's. Oh, I was so happy to seee that sporty 2 door red car, to me it was just like a smaller version of a Trans Am. Again I began my search. First car lot I went to I test drove a 2 dr black convertable. Payments were about $50 more dollars a month than I had planned, but I was willing to shut off the cable. That car had me hooked. It was small, roomy, sporty, cheap, and just fun to drive. Then I called my insurance company. Um, that's a little more than I want  to pay.  So we started over. I then went to a white 4 door. I really liked that. It was loaded with options, 4 doors but still sporty enough for me. But those options, OUCH!!! So I just had to leave. I lived Sunfire for weeks. One day I was on my way out of town and noticed my local car dealer had 2 of them &quot;program&quot; cars as they dubbed them. Dealer owened with less that 20,000  miles. No extra options. Just your basic features. One was a goldish tint, and one was bright red. I had to have that red one!! But someone was talking to the dealer about it. Lucky me, swept right in and took that ar right from under the nose. These cars run smooth and drive great. To this day I have no regrets. I even got   a personalized plate sunlvn. This car was $9,998. Just my budget, and even my insurance was cheap!! I get the oil change regularly and have never had it in the shop. I have added my own CD player. I love tha fact that my car is sporty, gets great gas miles, and has lots of room. It has been great for road trips. I highly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a nice, fun, sporty car that is also afordable. In a few years when I graduate, I don't plan on getting a Trans Am but rather upgrading to a new Sunfire. And my plate will transfer with me. Give one a test drive today.<br><br>
