            It's incredibly difficult to choose a digital camera these days.
There are digital cameras priced from $50 (yep) and go way up out
of the stratosphere.  First I had to define what I wanted to use the
camera for, and it turned out that I just wanted it to put pictures
on my web page and on auctions and to send to people through the net.
I really don't want to print them out... I'll use my regular camera
for that and find it easier and cheaper.

So I went to a respectable chain store that sells electronic equipment
and found a knowledgeable sales person who walked me through the
choices.  I told him I wanted to spend $200 - $400 and asked him to
tell me the differences between the $50 cameras and the $700 cameras, 
and we worked from there.  I narrowed it down quickly to the Kodak
and Olympus cameras both costing $300.  (I had a coupon for the
camera for 10% anything in the store so I did a bit better on the price.)

The DC215, which is the camera I got, turns out to be just the thing.
2x zoom, 1.8 LCD display, 1152 x 864 pixels, and a self timer are just
a few of its features.  It comes with installation software and fun
program to do strange things to your pictures.

After the salesman gave me the pitch and I was pretty confident that this
was the one I wanted, I went to &quot;epinions&quot; and checked my fellow writers'
opinions.. and they were all good and very helpful.  Then I went to the
Kodak website for this camera (which is terrific) and learned more info which finally convinced me.  I then told my husband, this is it
... we're not looking any more.. 
we're just going to buy it!  

It's been a great decision for me.  It's easy to use (important) and
great for pictures on the web.  I recommend an ac adapter since the regular batteries are useless... and also a rechargeable battery system
for when you can't use the adapter.<br><br>
