            When my 86 Integra reached 220,000 miles, I decided to go car shopping for a low mileage used car that I could rely on.  Being 18 years old and independent, I did not think that I could find such a great car value.  I went to the local Nissan dealership and he introduced me to this wonderful car.  I was never a Nissan fan.  I feel very lucky because my 93 Altima GXE was a one owner with only 69,000 miles when I bought it in 2000.  The car was garaged and is in immaculate condition.  I love the power!  The big 2.5L four is plenty power for me to zip around town with.  I am the envy of my friends and they think my car cost's way more that it did.  It has 80,000 miles on it now and is proving to me its reliability.   I haven't had any problems.  I am very meticulous with the car because it is like new even at almost 8 years old.  I love the comfort and the gas mileage is great!  I do not like the motorized antenna.  It can be annoying to hear when you turn the ignition.  Anyone looking for a stylish car with room for 5(4comfortably)with power and luxuries(without the luxurious price) should consider the Altima.  It is a cool car and I ride around town with confidence now.<br><br>
