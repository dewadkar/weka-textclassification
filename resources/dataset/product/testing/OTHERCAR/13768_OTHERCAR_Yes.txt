            Don't get me wrong, i do love my truck, but there are things about it that have changed my mind since i have purchased it.
First, the interior is very roomy and well accommodating, but it lacks in the amount of money spent on the materials, the area around my seats have broken.
The ash tray is too small, the nifty carrying space between the 2 front seats, is not deep enough and when you fold it back all the change rolls out into the back.
The paint on my truck has shown every small mark every time it is touched...
I do feel very safe and comfortable in it, and it is very roomy, but it was made in a hurry and not to my liking.
thank you<br><br>
