                When I bought my Saturn, I was looking for a reliable car, good on gas, and cheap in payments.  I was replacing my Saab 9000, which was demolished in an accident on my 17th birthday when a tractor trailer hit me and turned my life upside down!  I was petrified to get behind the wheel again, but after testing cars and facing the fact that I would need to drive eventually, the Saturn seemed to fit my needs. 
    From the first day I owned my 1994 Blue/Black Saturn SL2 I wanted a refund.  From the small things...the door speaker falling off every time you shut the door, or the gentle rattle of the loose panels, the leaky sunroof, or the malfunction of the window motors, to the major repairs...the entire roof and windshield due to rust caused by the sunroof, the transmission after 45,000 miles(not common), and the supposed smiley service which Saturn is rumored to be known for- I have never seen or been privileged to get in the 10 cities and 4 states I have gone to.  
    Now that I am in college and away from home, an unreliable car is the last thing I need.  When my transmission needed to be fixed I had to leave my car in the service center for 4 days, without a rental car, and when I got the car back it still wasn't fixed and I left it there for 3 more days.  That was a week without a car, and 2 trips to the dealer between classes.  At another dealer the leaky roof caused me to be without a car for 3 weeks, again with no rental, and to be charged for repairs I didn't know existed and more to be created it seems.  
    The Saturn name has not been the reliable, inexpensive, and worry free car that was sold to me.  I feel cheated and am in the market for a better car that can last through college.  Please heed my warnings and email me if you have any further questions.<br><br>
