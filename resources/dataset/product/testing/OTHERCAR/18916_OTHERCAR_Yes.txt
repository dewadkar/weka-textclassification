            I've owned my Allante for almost seven years now. I bought this fine machine brand new as one of the final products of its kind coming from the manufacturer. As some may not know, Cadillac ended its production of Allantes in early 1994. Over the past seven years, I cannot say that I've been unhappy with this automobile. The one 'handicap' of owing such a car is that it's virtually impossible to drive with during the winter, which means that you will require a backup car for all year long. In the summer, however, I please myself every day to climb in and drive to work. Although it's a fairly old car in design and fashion, it still draws stares left and right. Overall, the Northstar engine provides a smooth ride, never lacking power when most needed. A suggestion : On long stretches of road, when it may seem desireable to go 'a little faster', try to have the hard top on, as the soft top rattles and shakes like you wouldn't believe, and open air, this car isn't that great for windshield protection. If you have plenty of money to spend, this car is for you, and keep in mind, if you wait long enough, it may soon be an antique. Enjoy!<br><br>
