            I was finally able to afford a brand new car way back in 1994.  I had always relied on Toyota in the past.  My mother had nothing but good things to say about her Camry, and I loved my '79 Celica, but a Toyota, even the smallest new one was out of my price range.  After extensive research and decided on this new company out of Tennessee.

The first thing I loved was the salesmanship, or lack there of.  When I was thinking about a Honda Civic, I had an absolutely horrible experience at the dealership.  At Saturn, I was told to look around and just holler if I needed anything.  When it came time to pick the car, there wasn't any need for haggling.  All the prices for extras were right out in the open.  Now if you are the haggling type, you might be able to strike a better deal at other dealerships, but for ones that don't like the stress, it's so much easier.

I loved the cloth seats (one of my requirements when I was looking at new cars) and didn't see the need to upgrade to leather.  I live in Arizona so I NEEDED the air conditioner and got the whole power package.  I didn't get any of the silly frills, like a air foil for the back, but I do regret I didn't opt for the moon roof or CD player.  

The main negative I had was the gold metallic paint on the bumper.  For some reason, from pretty early on, I've had problems with it coming off too easily.  I complained to my dealer but they said it wasn't covered in the warranty.  I probably should have complained more in the earlier years, but it's merely cosmetic.  I may find some money one day and get it professionally repainted.

While the SC2 has back seats, they don't allow much leg room, so this is better for a single person or couple.  Also, some of my larger male friends have had trouble getting in or out of the front seat, so if you are tall or large, you might want to check out the spacing for yourself.

After getting the car, I took it for trip up and over the Rocky Mountains.  It was great!  I didn't have to worry about overheating as I climbed the huge inclines with ease.  After bringing her home, I made sure to get Goldie (that's what I call her) regular check ups, and have never had any problems with breakdowns.  Just minor repairs here and there.  People are surprised that it's a '94 since it runs so well and still looks great.  The gas mileage is great and the car is just plain fun to drive!
