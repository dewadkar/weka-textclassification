            1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee

Of all the SUVs I test drove and researched, I found this vehicle to be the best value. The in line 6 engine (or strait 6, as some call it) is one of the most reliable engines ever made. With the 6cl engine, there is plenty of pick up giving good speed for passing and entering the highway. 

The Jeep Grande Cherokee drives very much like a car with good handling and not a lot of play in the steering. This Jeep gets about 24mpg on the highway. All the controls are easy to see at a glance, keeping you from taking your eyes off the road for more than a second. Cruise control is on the steering wheel for easy access. 

The split 60/40 rear seat enables you to carry cargo and a rear seat passenger. This comes in very handy when you are traveling with more than 2 people. The netting provided helps keep cargo in place, especially handy when it come to keeping groceries standing up. 

The tinted windows are a plus. The large glass rear passenger and cargo windows allow a lot of light and in the summer, the tinting helps keep cargo relatively cool. 

My next car will be another Jeep Grand Cherokee, I like this one that much!<br><br>
