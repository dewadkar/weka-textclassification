            The Lincoln Navigator is one of the safest vehicles I've ridden in. The interior is so plush you feel as if you are truly in a luxury vehicle. The sound system is great and the other features are all top of the line.The leather interior is also of best quality. The navigator is a great looking vehicle that handles with ease. The only drawback that I have noticed is when sitting in the back seat,you may experience some motion sickness. A ride back there can get rather bumpy. Priced a little high but all in all, I give this vehicle a thumbs up. <br><br>
