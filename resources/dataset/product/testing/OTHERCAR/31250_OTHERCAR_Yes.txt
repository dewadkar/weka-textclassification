            I have read a lot of reviews. Some of the ones i read are good, others are not. I am basing that more on complaints made by the drivers, not the car it self. My car so far is a lemon. I bought it in January 2003 with 153,000+ miles on it from a towing company that had it previously for up to six months. I paid $2,500 for a two door, green Grand Am GT 95, quad for standard, and since then had to invest close to $7,000 dollars in six months. The man that sold me the car said he checked it out and everything seemed to be fine. He claimed to have put new bearings in the transmission and other nonsense. Well from sitting out for so long, the brakes needed to be shaved and an oil change, but lucky for me it was all free because I took it to my auto shop class and cleaned it up. Little did I know, my luck was over. Next thing that happened was my engine blew. That cost me $2,500 to fix, plus an additional $400 to remove and install the engine plus have new bearings and joints installed. The car has since gone through two O2 sensors, a MAP sensor ($77.00), and oil light (the O2's and the oil light, along with shop time, up to three days cost me $1,000). I replaced the igniters under the plate on top of the engine. Right front axle broke when the right wheel bearing went causing my rotor to twist and break my ABS "clickers" so that cost me $1,600, two alternators, 2 fuel pumps. The work done to the car, most of it was unnecessary, granted the axle and brakes needed to be replaced, but the fuel pumps, O2 sensors and at least one alternator didn't need replacing because the car had bad grounds. The car cost me so much money because the GM trained mechanics kept saying there was nothing wrong and when the O2 code went off, they opted to replace the sensor, not check anything else. Because of the bad grounds, the alternator(s) had to work overtime in order to compensate. So far there are a lot of negatives about this car. Yes the passenger side power lock doesn't work for that side, but it does lock my door. Yes the driver-side window doesn't close correctly. But the expensive stuff was a result from age; parts wearing each other down and the technician&#146s inability to correctly fix the problem from the get go. 
Other than those problems I love my car. It drives really well, takes the corners very good. Feels sporty and has some pop. I wouldn't suggest my Grand Am GT to anyone but myself, but when these run well, they run well. I was unfortunate to grab mine, which was my top choice when looking for a vehicle last January, but the parts wear out, just like any other car, but my car also had a rebuild in it when I bought it, so I ended up rebuilding a rebuild. I know when my car is running right and wrong. I have a connection with my automobile and I just love my Grand Am GT even though it has cost me so much money in the first year I have owned it. It just has that grip. It is the first car I bought that I really wanted. I had a Dodge Neon 98 before that and I didn't like the lack of power. So when I went after my next car, I said Grand Am GT or two door Cavalier. I got my GT and I am happy, even if she cost me money, just like any kid.
