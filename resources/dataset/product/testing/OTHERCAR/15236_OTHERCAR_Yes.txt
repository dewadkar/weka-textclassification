            My little baby loves to drive.  She likes quality gasoline and open highways.  Sometimes she is a little moody, but she never complains.  This is a wonderful car.  It literally has a little of everything.  It's quick and responsive, while not burning tons of fuel.  It's small and convenient while still having a decent amount of storage space.  True the back seat is a little small, but take a look at the Mitsubishi Eclipse, my head does not even fit in that back seat.  The stereo that comes standard with the car is functional and has terrific sound quality (6 speakers), and the overall layout of the cockpit is perfect.  This is a car that has been evolving for some time in the Civic, and the smaller Accords, and the earlier Integras.  In short you are getting tons of good stuff for the amount of money you are spending.  You get a very sporty level of performance without sacrificing a great deal of gas or practicality.  Not to mention the fact that the car has gone over 70,000 miles in 2 1/2 years without one problem (knock on wood).  

The real thing is this; when I first got it, I was pleased, but nothing about the car really lit my fire.  As the years have passed however, and she has proven herself time and again on the highways and biways of this land, I have grown to love her.  My Sweet Pea, a great car, at what I
think is a great price.<br><br>
