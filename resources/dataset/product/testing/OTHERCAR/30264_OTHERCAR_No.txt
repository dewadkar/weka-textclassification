            I bought it because it was cheap.  I got it through Ubid.com - fell victim to bidding frenzy.

Good: Taking pictures was easy, really a cute point and shoot camera.  Controls are easy to find as there ..almost a copy of a regular camera

BAD:  

1. Fuzzy pictures more of a blur than anything else. Faces are unrecognizable, you only see splotches of color.  It's ok with sharp inanimate objects under very bright lighting.  the flash is too bright so it's only useful under total darkness otherwise it will white everything out.  Very long wait time between photos so there goes that perfect shot. eats batteries very fast.

solution: buy decent 35mm camera and low end scanner. 
you are better off gettitng a 35mm film developed and scanning it in quality wise this way I'm getting expensive digital camera results without paying $800

2. Cannot connect camera to pc: communication problems, AGFA was not too helpful as some of thier instructions are so complicated that they warn that you'd need help from your computer tech support.

3. bright green &quot;ready&quot; light is blinding as it's positioned almost right next to view finder so you can't see through the veiw finder.  I find that you have to cover that light with your finger to see though it.

4. rubber cover protecting serial jacks was flimsy, it ripped in the first 10 mins while opening to get to those serial jacks.

Should you buy this?  NO absolutely not it's a waste of $80, what good is a camera if you can't even download pictures from camera to pc or if it's so fuzzy you can't make it out.   <br><br>
