            I picked up my steel gray 330cic this month, and it's been a joy to drive from day one: plenty of power, snappy handling (more on this), and the self-stowing fully automatic top is marvelous. This car is everything I expected it to be.

ENGINE
The engine in this car is almost silent at rest, but provides plenty of power on the highway. I can easily pass slow moving traffic without downshifting from fifth. The exhaust lets out a lovely throaty growl when starting out, but isn't intrusive at higher speeds.

TRANSMISSION
The clutch isn't as quick as that on my Mitsubishi Eclipse, nor are the shifter throws as short. That's not to say that this is difficult car to drive, and to be fair my car isn't fully broken in. If you want the snick-snick shifting of a Miata, this isn't your car.

HANDLING
Handling is solid around curves with minimal body roll, and the brakes bring this relatively heavy car to a smooth and straight stop. On the highway, the combination of a powerful engine with plenty of torque, great handling, and powerful brakes makes for confident driving no matter the conditions. Blip the throttle and you rocket on by.

One note: BMW increased the steering boost on some 330s built before May 2001, including the convertibles. BMW offers a free retrofit to the "old" steering, and I recommend taking them up on it via the Owners Circle on BMWUSA.com.

CONVERTIBLE TOP
The top raises and lowers with the press of a button in 10-12 seconds (I've never timed it, but it's quick), no latches to undo or tonneau to snap in place since it stows itself beneath a hard cover. The rear window is glass and heated. I've had people stop dead in their tracks just to watch the top come down.

EXTERIOR
This is an evolutionary rather than revolutionary update to the last 3-series. The nicest improvement, in my opinion, is the beautiful lower grill and titanium trim around the new headlight design.

INTERIOR
Eight-way power leather seats are comfortable, but be wary if the day is sunny, the top is down, and you're wearing shorts. Ow. Dash layout is logical, with instrument, audio, and climate controls clustered where you expect them. The onboard computer control on the left-hand stalk is easy to use and helpful. Two cupholders up front. Sunglass holder is a smart design, as is the extra storage in the center rest. Rear seats are comfortable, but get gusty with the top down.

SAFETY
Rollover protection is built in to the rear headrests, so you don't see it until you need to (unlike the huge aluminum hoops on a TT). Car key electronics make the car almost theft-proof, and can be assigned to automatically adjust the seats and mirrors depending on which key is used. The alarm includes a motion detector, but cost $600 to have installed by my dealer.

EXTRAS
Xenon headlights are worth it. Seat heaters are god's gift to convertibles. Get them. Harmon Kardon 12-speaker stereo system (now standard) sounds great, and adjusts the volume based on your speed. In-dash CD works as advertised, and steering wheel controls are convenient. Rear distance sensors are gadgety, but I'm still glad I got them (in reverse, they beep when you're 2' from an object and then beep faster and faster as you get closer); I actually think having the right-hand mirror automatically tilt down when I'm in reverse is more useful, but visibility out of the rear window with the top up is limited.

IS THIS CAR FOR YOU?
This is the car you buy to treat yourself well. It's beautifully designed, a blast to drive with the top down, and draws attention whether parked or in motion. It makes commuting a joy and leisure trips that much more enjoyable. You feel, hear, and smell the countryside change around you.

But...this is not a Camry. It's expensive, has a rear seat that is hard to climb into (and isn't protected from the wind with the top down), and averages about 20 mpg on premium fuel. Insurance is also high, and availability in the San Francisco area is incredibly limited, which lends itself to further price gouging.
