            I bought my 1998 Honda Accord EX new in April of 1998 and I have been in love with it ever since.  It is without a doubt the most comfortable, quiet and smooth riding vehicle I have ever owned, and these are the qualities I was looking for when I was shopping for a new vehicle.  It has so many wonderful features, among my very favorite is the Moon roof, and of course the CD player which has a terrific sound. I love the comfort of the seats, which fit me like a glove and the roominess is unbelievable.  The back seat is just phenomenal, there is so much room! I could go on and on about all the great features such as the power door locks (I also have the keyless entry, which I absolutely love) and windows.  My Honda is an absolute dream to drive and it gets great gas mileage, which is a big plus with gas prices as they are.  I honestly can't think of one single thing I would change about my Honda.  Oh, did I mention the get up and go it has, you have to drive it to believe it and you would never believe it's only a 4 cylinder.  I can't think of any good reason why everybody shouldn't own a Honda.  I know I'll never even consider anything but the best and the best is definitely HONDA!<br><br>
