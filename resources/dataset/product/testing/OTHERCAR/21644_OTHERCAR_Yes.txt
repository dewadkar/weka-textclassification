            I leased my 1999 CL in August. I've been shopping around for a few months, test-driven several models, like Toyota Camry Solara and Nissan Maxima SE, and the CL was a clear winner.

Right off the bat: the exterior design is great. I love it, and it turns heads a lot more often than you would think. For an extra $650 or so, install the rear spoiler for the complete look. 

Other pros: 3.0 V6 engine gives you that under 8 sec 0-60 that only a true enthusiast can appreciate. Dashboard is nicely designed, seats are as comfortable as in any car (at least the front), and the car is easy to handle and fun to drive. Trunk is huge, and has a net for grocery shopping and a convinient hole for skis. The climate control is great; the heated seats a big plus in the winter, and don't forget that Bose stereo sound!

The back seat is great for two people, but not that comfortable for three, though. I think it's as good as you can make it for a coupe without sacrificing the appearance. My passengers sometimes complained that their seat belt is hard to reach and the seat is not as easily moved as the driver's. The mileage is the city is pretty low, around 16 mpg, but the highway will give about 30 mph.

Finally, the best thing about buying or leasing an Acura - you don't have to worry about options. Everything is included in the base model: leather seats, Bose sound system, sunroof, climate control, you name it. The dealers do have some &quot;accessories&quot; you might choose to install. The ones I chose and recommend are the spoiler I mentioned before, tape player (or CD changer). Moonroof visor is a must if you enjoy a fast ride on a nice summer day and you can probably get it thrown in for free just as the floormats.

Altogether, this is one stylish, convenient car that's sporty and fun to drive, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.<br><br>
