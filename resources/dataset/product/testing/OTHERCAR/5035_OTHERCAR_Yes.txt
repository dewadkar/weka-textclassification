            This vehicle is everything one could ask for, it is sporty, roomy, comfortable, great mpg, extremely peppy and just a joy to drive.  It is classy with good fit and finish, yet stealthy enough to keep you out of trouble.  There is a thriving aftermarket business for performance parts. This car is perfect for a multiple function family, roomy for family, 4-door, sporty and gets great mpg.  I would recommend this car to anybody without hesitation.  It has been a joy to own and drive, the kids love it and so does the wife!<br><br>
