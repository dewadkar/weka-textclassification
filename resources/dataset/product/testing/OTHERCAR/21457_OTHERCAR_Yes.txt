            I bought my Eclipse GT on October 4th 2000.  I was impressed by the body style and the V-6 with 200 hp will really pick up and go.  I choose the new style over the previous because it has a more grown up feel to the car. While it is still a sports car, it rides much smoother and has more of a luxury look to the interior. The only problems I've had are that when it rains or when you wash your car, water gets stuck inside the door which will leave your windows streaked with water when you roll them up or down.  This will typically last several days.  I've heard that some owners have drilled holes in the bottom of the doors to drain the water out.  Another problem I've had is that there are several noises and squeaks that come from the inside interior which for a new $20,000 car, this should not happen.  As far a driving goes, this car is a blast to drive!!!  When I first got it, everywhere I went, people were looking at me and telling me how sharp my car looks.  If you buy this car, get the V6 as it has almost 50 more horsepower.  Another thing to keep in mind, don't try pulling tight U-turns in this car as it has a wide radius, making them very hard and you will probably run over curbs.
