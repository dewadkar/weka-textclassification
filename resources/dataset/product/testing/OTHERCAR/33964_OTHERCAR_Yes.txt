            My 929 is also a 1992.  I bought if with 54K in 1997 at age 5 years old.  I purchased 36K and 3 years of more warranty.  It was a Texas car and I live in Minnesota.  For the rough winters, I wanted a rear drive.  Seriously, I was planning to drive to Texas and needed a good road car.  I liked the styling and I got it for $11K.

Almost three years later, no real problems.  Using synthetic oil every 3-4K miles.  Burns about a quart in that time.  I commute 22 to and 22 back - work  It now has 90K and seems fine.  I believe it needs plugs and wires.  I did the radiator at 79K when it broke and changed the timing belt at 70K to keep extended warranty going.  It expired at 90K.  I changed the transmission oil at 68K.  A transmission mount was done under warranty about the radiator time.  Normal brakes and tire wear.

I plan to keep it.  Shocks in the rear were priced high at $400 and I fear the costly repairs that you faced.  Most reviews I read are good value and fairly positive.  My Mazda dealer seems to like them compared to Millenia, a big 626, they say.  They compared the 929 to Mercedes, with its rear drive.  Last of the rear drives.  Not a good idea to have rear drive in Minnesota, home of snow, but not much ice.  

I fear the road salt, but so far the 8 years seem to show no rust.  My wife's Jeep is doing well for a 1995 with same mileage.

So, I think my note counters your note.  But I like your positive ending.  It does drive well.  &quot;Great road car&quot; according to some, with 112&quot; wheelbase it ought to ride well.  Some of the interior is falling out.  Drivers seat wear is higher but the leather seems tough.

I wish you better luck.  Some friends think it is good for 200K.  The engine rattles a bit when cold but idles well and is quiet after warm up.  I do not push it hard.  Steady 60-70 on freeways to work.   Some stop and go.
