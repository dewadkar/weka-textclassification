            After a couple of used domestic cars, I thought it was time to get something new and "nice" that I would want to keep for a long time. The Jetta came to mind right away: I had a Golf in Europe and I knew that a Volkswagen would be reliable and fun to drive. After doing some research on the Jetta, I was amazed by the number of standard features that come with it: 6 airbags, 4-wheel ABS, ASR (traction control), 4-wheel disk brakes, power windows, etc., etc. Factoring in all these features, the Jetta does not turn out to be that much more expensive than a similarly equipped Honda Civic or Ford Focus (I had rejected these cars already based on their looks, but that's just me). And of course, I'd seen some Jettas in traffic, and I really liked the look of this model, in particular the somewhat pouting face, and the tight and buttoned-down look (no flashy/silly spoilers and fog lamps - they are really just for show).

So anyway, I knew what I wanted: silver exterior/ black cloth interior/ sport suspension and 17" wheels (the regular wheels on the 2003 models look at little bit bland to me). I also opted for the 1.8 litre turbo with a manual transmission. I've read great things about the turbo, and I did not like the idea of having an automatic transmission with such a small engine (the manual is cheaper too, of course). The test drive at the dealer convinced me right away that this was the way to go: the turbo delivers max. power at ~2000 RPM which really gets you going. The dealer was able to find a Jetta just like I wanted it (except that it came with the winter package - heated seats and mirrors - that I don't really need), and it was on their lot a couple of days later.

I've had the Jetta for 5 months - 3,500 miles now, and here are my impressions.

(1) The engine is just fantastic! It is quite as strong as any V-6 I've ever driven, and the 5-speed lets me dial in the power just like <i>I</i> want it. It is very quiet below 4000 RPM (and I rarely need to go above that), and revs astonishingly low for a 4 cylinder: idle speed is 700 RPM, highway cruising at 70 mph is ~3000 RPM. So far, I get about 25 to 26 mpg doing mostly city driving.

(2) Handling is superb, the car seems to be glued to the road - it feels very safe. On the ruined and notoriously pothole-ridden streets of Michigan, the ride can get a little bit rough with the sport suspension. The traction control ASR is overly conservative: if you want to perform some nice "controlled drifts" while turning, you'll have to turn it off.

(3) As far as build quality is concerned, the Jetta is definitely at the top of its class; the materials do not feel cheap, the paint jobs is flawless, and they do give a lot of attention to detail. For example, the trunk area actually looks as good as the rest of the car; it's not just the place where you throw your stuff in. There were some issues with interior noises, though: starting the first or second week, the car developed some rattles in both front doors; I took it to the dealer, they lubricated the seals, but the noises returned after a day or two. I went to work with silicone spray and multi-purpose lubricant myself, and was able to get rid of the rattles. Some more groaning and rattling occurred later, but I was able to get them out too. The car is fairly quiet now, but the experience left me in a state of "noise-paranoia" - I'm always listening this way and that for the slightest squeak.
I do believe the car was very "dry" when new, and that the additional lubrication did the trick.

(4) Finally, yes, you can believe the folklore that the rear seats are small: this is because the rear bench is very narrow (laterally). I agree with a previous reviewer that the Jetta is in essence a 2 2 sedan. Front seat space however is ample, visibility is excellent, the red and purple instruments are just awesome. O.k., the cup holder is a joke, but this Jetta is not a vehicle to be drunk in, but to be driven!
