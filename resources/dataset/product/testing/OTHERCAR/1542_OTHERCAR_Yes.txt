            I had always driven hondas, but when my last one started to die, and I knew that I was going to be commuting a lot, My parents decided to buy me another car.  They didn't have much money to spend, so looked around and found that the best deal was a 96' Saturn.  It was only $4,400 and was in excellent condition.  It was 5 speed, which I didn't know how to drive, but I quickly learned on it, and to this day it is the easiest, and smoothest standard car I have driven.  

The exterior of the car is very nice and pretty durable.  The inside is attractive as well, but does look a little cheap.  This model does have all the cheapest components, which means no power anything.  At first this was a huge disappointment since I had always had power windows, locks, and especially steering, but I slowly got used to this.  

This car is pretty roomy, although the seats are pretty stiff.  I do get some complaints that the backseat is too upright and people complain that it feels wierd to sit in, but I have never sat back there myself.  

I do have to admit that it is great on gas.  I get gas about once a week or sometimes every two weeks, which is very impressive.  

The defrost components in the car are very poor and take quite some time to start thawing.  Although the windshield wipers are excellent.  

I feel as though this is a great car for the buck, although it is not much to show off, it does the job of transporting me to wherever I want to go.  However, since it does lack many of the luxuries that other cars have, I do not plan on keeping much longer and plan on buying something different once I get enough money.  Otherwise, if you're just looking for an cost efficient ride, its perfect.
