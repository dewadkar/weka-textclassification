            We(wife &amp; I) agreed to purchase this vehicle because of the price and warranty(10 years,100,000 miles.) This is the fourth Hyundai product that we have owned. It has a very good ride.  My back doesn't hurt after an extended trip.  The Elantra holds the road quite well.  We have already put 7,000 miles on our 2000 model with automatic transmission and the fuel mileage has been consistent at 31 mpg on the highway at 70+ mph.  My wife is semi-invalid and has no difficulty accessing or driving the vehicle.  Recommended for about anyone.  Only things that I don't like is you have to plan wisely about what to take on a long trip (limited trunk space that is typical of a small car) and no arm rests.<br><br>
