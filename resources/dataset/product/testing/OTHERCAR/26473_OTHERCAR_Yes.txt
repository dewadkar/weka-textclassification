            Our Plymouth Voyager (Grand LE) is 9 years old and has been loved for over 100,000 miles. We recently purchased another van and are trying to sell this one ourselves as the trade in offered wasn't worthy of our van. 
For 3 sons the 4 captains chairs and back bench seating was perfect. This way everyone had their own seat and a window seat to boot! No more fights on long trips about whose turn it is to sit by the window.
Options that have been invaluable include:
*Dual Air conditioning
*Luggage Rack which is big enough to carry 2 wind surfers and our beach chairs
*Trip Computer - My husband loves this feature although I must admit I appreciate knowing how many miles I can drive before we run out of gas
*We have the wood grain applique and I suppose I'm an old beach bunny because this van was made for trips to the beach. Whenever we go on our annual camping trip to Fort DeSoto Park in Florida we play the Beach boys Real loud as we hit the border. 
*Rear Window Wiper - what a great idea!
Equipment that, quite frankly, is beyond me
*ABS (4 wheel)
*Tilt wheel - I never use this
*Cruise Control - Again, I never use
This van has been, for the most part, trustworthy and reliable. We are, however very glad we purchased the extended warranty. It saved us much money in the long run.
