            In August of 1995 I purchased a new Neon Sport Coupe to replace my used 1983 Toyota Supra.  The Neon did not have the same level of comfort that the Supra did but it was more fun to drive and in my price range.  5 years, 115,000 miles, 2 broken clutch cables, 2 new O2 sensors, all new hoses, and a semi-dysfunctional radio later I still like my Neon.

Yes, it has the typical frameless window air leaks and it has some creaks and groans that have developed but it starts every time I put the key in it and still gets 26 MPG around town.

I am disappointed that the clutch cable has broken twice (I keep a spare in the trunk after my wife was stranded 4 hours from home one Sunday morning) but overall I like the car.  I don't plan to replace it until something MAJOR fails.

Other than safety recalls and nit-picky things covered under the warranty the car has been in the shop only once and that was to replace the timing belt at the prescribed mileage interval.  I have maintained the car myself and other than 1 heater hose being a major pain to replace and the nightmare of replacing the upper O2 sensor it hasn't been bad.

Like I said, I like my Neon<br><br>
