            I am satisfied with my 1996 Chrysler Cirrus which I purchased in May of 1999. I bought it in emaculate condition and I am pleased with theway it has held up. I am an 18 year old high school student so I probably drive it rougher than it should be drivven but it has endured.I only have had minor problems with it including having to replace a oil pressure sensor for around a hundred dollars and I put new tires on it. I also have minor problems with the car starting when it is cold out. I live in a cooler climate and it seems to be sluggish starting in the mornings. I am very impressed with the quality and durability of the vehicle. I live in a rural community with many dirt roads that are in poor condition and it has held up very good. I would definetly recommend this car to anyone who need a very reliable car.<br><br>
