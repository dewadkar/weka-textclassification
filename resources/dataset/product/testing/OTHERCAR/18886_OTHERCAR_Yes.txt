            I've never understood the logic behind Honda racing.  Yes, there are some fast Civics out there, with $10,000 blueprinted motors stripped chasis's, and the such.  In my years of racing import cars, most Hondas were SLOW!  Even with a turbo kit, the motor wasn't designed to take boost, so they could run very little, and they were still slow.  My point; either go with a large motor which can make big hp, or go with a car that came turbo stock and build on that.  In steps the Eclipse.  With 205hp stock, they already have a 50+hp advantage on Hondas, and are only 20hp away from 80's Vettes (but the Vette has a bunch more torque).  With a boost controller, filter, exhaust, and other minor mods, 250hp is easily obtained.  This will take most early 90's Camaros and Mustangs.  Add a larger turbo, fuel injection, and the such, and 400hp is VERY realistic.  Even more amazing is that the motor can handle it reliably.  Now the rest of the car can't (tranny, axles, etc), but they are usually good up to 300hp, which is plenty of power.  Also factor in the AWD, and you have a launch that no RWD of FWD car can match.  I raced these cars for several years and am still amazed at what they can be made to do.  When you also consider that they can be bought for dirt cheap, they make a great car whether its strictly to race, or a speed freak on a tight budget.
