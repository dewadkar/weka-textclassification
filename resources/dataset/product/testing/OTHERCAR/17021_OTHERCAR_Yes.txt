            The Dodge Durango is a great sport utility vehicle.  I bought my 1998 Durango for commuting, hauling large items, towing trailers, and as a bad weather (snow, ice, rain) vehicle.  It has done well for all these things.  I did not get the aft seat option (many buy the Durango for seating up to 7 with the aft seat), but there is plenty of room in mine for 5, and with the flat floor in the back with the back seats folded, there is a generous floor for hauling items - and I also can stretch out and sleep there (I am 6'1&quot;) when camping.  Four foot wide items (such as a sheet of plywood) can fit in the back, but must go in a little diagonally as the back hatch isn't quite 4 feet wide.  

The greatest bonus with the Durango is its reliability.  I had real reservations buying a Chrysler product (bad experiences by friends), and also as a first year vehicle, but in the 36,000 miles I have driven it in the past 2 years it has been extremely reliable.  It drives well (tracks better than the all-wheel drive 1996 Explorer I used to own), is quiet, and has a reasonably smooth ride.  The seats are comfortable, and basic creature comforts like cup holders, gauges, and vent outlets are all well thought out.  

The biggest negative has been gas mileage.  I have 4 wheel drive and the 5.2L V-8 and on an initial highway trip with stuff strapped on the roof I got 14.5 mpg.  Since then the engine has broken in, and I averaged 19 mpg on a recent 5000 mile trip out west.  Around town I get about 15 mpg.  Also be sure to rotate the tires regularly - at 20,000 miles without rotation I had excessive front tire wear because I hadn't rotated the tires.

I feel like I made a good decision in getting the Durango.  As the Durango TV ads say, it provides more room and towing capacity than the other mid-size SUVs, without the size and expense of the full size SUVs.<br><br>
