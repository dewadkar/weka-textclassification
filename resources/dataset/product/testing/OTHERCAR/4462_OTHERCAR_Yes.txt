            2000 Cabrio GLS.  This is my second Cabrio.  I traded in a 1996 Cabrio GLS.  There are many improvements since I purchased my last one.  
Some improvements are:

--remote keyless entry
--fog lights
--electric roof
--glove box
--heated windshield washers
--better dash lights
--heated seats.

     The Cabrio continues to ride well and really hug the road on corners.   It is an extremely dependable car with an outstanding three year bumper to bumper warranty.  The best thing about the warranty is that there is never any cost for maintenance during warranty service.  

      I have found that this year there seems to be more squeaks and rattles than in my previous Cabrio. Dealer service has been extremely courteous, punctual, and thorough.  This is the best convertible value in existence.<br><br>
