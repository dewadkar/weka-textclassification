            I love Volvos. &quot;Volvo was my first word as a baby, I would sit in the driver's seat holding onto the steering wheel say &quot;Vovo!&quot; over and over again. All my life I have held a special place in my heart for the wonderful Sweedish cars. I have a 1990, blue Volvo station wagon 240DL. It is an excellent car over all! The ride is quiet, the transmission smooth, it handles well even though it is fairly old, and it has plenty of room for just about anything you want to transport. It handles well in the snow and is very, very safe. My car has over 150,000 miles on it but still doesn't have any major problems and rarely has to be taken into the shop. Granted it is not exactly the &quot;coolest&quot; looking car, but hey it has a certain charm to it. The body of the car is very durable and is still in great condition dispite various fender benders and its many road trips. I love this car and recommend it to any parent who is looking for a good, safe, first car for their teenager or to anyone who wants a good, sturdy, reliable, long lasting car that is very spacious. Drive safely!<br><br>
