                 For many months I longed to purchase a digital camera.  After shopping around, I chose the Vivitar 2700 because it appeared to take a decent picture and was priced affordably.  I found out shortly thereafter that I made a huge mistake.  

     I purchased the camera in the fall of 1998.  Within a month of buying the camera, I moved to a new home and lost my receipt and warranty on the camera.  Within two months of buying the camera, I was starting to have problems.  

     The first problem to occur was with the battery door.  The hinges were cheaply made and broke off very easily.  I tried to return the camera to the place where I purchased it and they refused to take replace it or take it back.  I then e-mailed Vivitar and did not get a return response.  I had to make the best of the camera and taped the door shut.  

     The camera would eat up batteries like crazy.  I would go through 4 batteries in less than 36 pictures.  Forget it if I used the flash!!! It would might have been cheaper to purchase 35mm film and have it developed.

     After five months of owning the camera, it finally died.  I was taking a picture using the flash when I noticed that the camera was getting hot.  I'm not exactly sure what went wrong, but one of the batteries got so hot that it melted inside the camera.  That was the end of the camera.  I was able to get the battery out, but the camera would not work afterwards. I again e-mailed Vivitar for assistance and they did not respond.  

     This fall, I purchased another brand of digital camera.  It was a little more expensive, but it has been nothing but a pleasure to use.  <br><br>
