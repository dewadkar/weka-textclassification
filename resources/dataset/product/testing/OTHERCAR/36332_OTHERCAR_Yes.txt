            I have had my 1991 Celica GT since May 2000 and I am very pleased with this car.  I will divide my review into 4 topics.  Style, Comfort, Performance, and Reliablity.

Style
   The style of this car is very good.  The lines are very sleek and well-defined.  The flip-up headlights, along with the fog lights, make the front end very sporty looking.  I have a spoiler and sunroof on mine, along with the alloy wheels.  Overall, this car is very good looking.

Comfort
    Although this car is catoragized into the sub-compact class, it is very roomy.  Roomy is used to describe the front seats, the back seats are not big enough to seat anybody for an extended period of time.  I'm 6'1 and I fit just fine in the comfortable bucket seats.  

Performance
    The Celica GT comes with a 2.2 4-cly. engine.  When equiped with the 5 speed transmission, the car is very quick and fun to drive.

Reliability
    Here is where this car, and every other Toyota really shine.  I bought car with 105,000 miles on it, and it hasn't failed me yet.  The only repairs needed are basic wear and tear.  My friend has a 91 Celica with over 200,000 on it, and it runs like new.  All you need to do, is change the oil every 3,000 and it will run for at least 200,000 or more.  

Overall
    If you are thinking about purchasing a Celica, you would be wise to do so.  They are the perfect cars for single people, or a college student who needs reliabile transportation, good gas mileage(30 and above) and a sporty flair.
