            A while back, I was commuting to work that was 300 miles away.  I rented the Rodeo for six months and drove weekly.  I had the opportunity to drive about five Rodeos over that time, and here is a collection of my thoughts.

I will not purchase this vehicle for these reasons:

1. Things seemed to break too often.  The rear windshield wiper was in a constant state of disrepair.  The heater broke twice on two different vehicles within weeks apart. (And drive through the wintery north without heater was very dangerous.) 

2. The 4WD, when engaged, couldn't make small turns.  In addition, there was a loud, abrasive engine noise when turned to the maximum.  In addition, the gear seemed to disengage or slipped out every so often when turning to the maximum.

3. The fuel economy is pretty bad.  On highways, it's less than 18 mpg.  On local roads, I think it's almost half of that, or about 10 mpg.

The vehicle does offer a few good feathers.  The One Button to engage the 4WD is nice, and the cup holder is molded plastic and accommodates most cup sizes.

In my opinion, unless you get a great deal on this car, stay away from it.  Try the Ford Explore or Nissan Pathfinder.<br><br>
