                 Ok, I'm a disgrace! I own a V-6 (3.8)... I'm so sorry! It's an RS for really slow.  Not really, I love my car, Camaros' are so much fun to drive, and you can feel the surge of power when you hit the gas!  Although it's a (V-6), I'm working on increasing the horsepower.  I'm thinking exhaust system, air-intake, spark plugs, muffler, the works.  I may even drop a V-8 in that bad-boy.  I'd like to point out that it still has balls for a V-6, even for an automatic.  Now I really wish I had gotten a Manuel.   

Chevy makes dependable cars, unlike Fords, (Fix or repair daily, found on the road dead, F**ked over on race day, post comments to add to list :).  For a true maintenance like a repair, I've had one, which was to replace the power steering fluid hose ($123.92).  My Camaro was purchased back in August of 1999, where it had 44,000 miles on it.  I have had one accident, some FORD truck ran a red and barreled into me at 30Mph, I was unhurt, as for my car, 6k in damage (built like a rock!).  

If you take care of your car it will last you well over 100,000 miles.  I do the regular oil changes, although they are not easy, the car is low to the ground. I have to be careful not to bottom my car out.  I wash and wax my car whenever the weather permits.  The funny thing is my car still operates just as well as it did before the accident.  I really am grateful for such a low-maintenance car.                

  With the combination of its sleek design and feel for power, it takes my breath away.  I fell in love with my 96' shiny blue Camaro the day I saw it at the dealership.  I paid for the car myself, and I continue to pay for maintenance, gas, insurance, and repairs.  Mommy and Daddy don't hand me anything I worked hard for my car and I love it.  One thing that can be an inconvenience is the rear-wheel drive when the weather is bad.  The car was well equipped for this though, second gear start, this starts the car off slower so you don't spin your tires and it gives you more power.  (First gear gives you more speed to get your car moving, so you spin your tires more).    Besides if you don't drive like an idiot it handles well.  When it�s icy, doing doughnuts is a blast.    

MPG- depends on how I�m driving :) anywhere from 220-260mpg.  I live in the Suburbs, driving it to work, school, and around my town.   

On the expressway the car has great power, even when I�m going 80-90mph I can still hit the gas and get a great boost!  That's true power.  I've only had the chance to go about 110, and I still had 1/3 the petal to go.     

The car is a &quot;pimp ride&quot; as well, girls are all over it.  &quot;Can I have a ride?&quot; &quot;Will you let me have it?&quot;  &quot;It's so shiny!&quot; :)...

My car came with a &quot;Y&quot; pipe, which are two pipes coming from one muffler.  So it looks dual exhaust but isn't.  

This is my first car, and I will always buy American made!
