            I bought my Cabrio GLS 1998 (white with black top) in April 2000.  It had 24,000 miles and was in mint condition.  My decision was conditioned by the following factors: (1) a cabriolet; (2)a small car (the parking space behind my DC townhouse is shared with another VW owner); (3) sufficient performance; (4) style.  I guess I am biased towards European cars and VW was an obvious choice.  Furthermore, there were not many competitors on the American market.

I shopped around on the Internet and came across a perfect car at a dealership in Maryland.  Went there and test drove it -- wonderful -- and made the deal on the spot.

The car is just plain beautiful.  It runs like a dream and has high performance considering its size.  The drivability is great and the comfort in the driver's seat for a big guy (I'm 6 ft 2) is as good as anything I've ever experienced.  I've never been as satisfied with a car in my life (I should say that this is my 6th own car and I've had, i.a., a BMW and a MB).

Nevertheless a couple of gripes.  The trunk is small, there's no doubt about it.  I travel a lot and often go to the airport.  The trunk fits one full-sized Samsonite, just barely.  But of course you can stick additional bags on the back seat; this is easy especially in the warmer season when you can open the roof (the only thing that I've had problems with is the electronic mechanism to open the roof).

Anyway, nothing's perfect and you can't find a better -- and more fun -- car!<br><br>
