            I bought this truck because of its looks.I have added a high performance cam,headers,KaN air filter.The truck is FAST and runs great.the size of the truck is why i really bought this truck.I like highway driving and camping with it,It is only a 2WD but i do take it up and down hills it fits in small places.There is some noise on the roads but it is no a $30,000 dollar luxury car so small things like that don't add up to all the good this truck has done.I believe that this truck is worth buying to use as a work or just a fun driver.All cars,trucks have problems but nothing is perfect.I own 88 Hardbody 2.4L 4 speed 2WD its a keeper.Love to all the people that own a truck like mine!!<br><br>
