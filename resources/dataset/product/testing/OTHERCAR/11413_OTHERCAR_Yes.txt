                Its been three months since I have my 4Runner. After this length of time I have additional comments on this vehicle. I never imagined that the towing package I got with the truck would have another very important purpose. That purpose is it acts as a bumper protector and prevents damage to the underside of the vehicle if you are hit in the rear. I was fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, was one of the people who found out first hand what the towing package would do. I was struck in the rear by your average Ford auto, in this case a taxi. The taxis bumper hit my tow hitch bar (a very sturdy piece of metal)No damage to my truck at all and it prevented the auto from going under my truck. The cabs bumper was dented by striking the hitch bar.
    In addition I have found that the gas mileage is exactly the same as the range on the sticker when I purchased the truck. Annoying however is that I am constantly filling up the gas tank. It would have been nice if they made the gas tank larger than the 18 gal. tank it came with. 
    I found the radio it comes wit ( the six speakers and the CD player are top notch. I prefer to listen to a CD in the truck than on my stereo at home. All of the other features Ride , handling, and comfort remain pleasantly positive. Hope the next three months is as good as the first three.  <br><br>
