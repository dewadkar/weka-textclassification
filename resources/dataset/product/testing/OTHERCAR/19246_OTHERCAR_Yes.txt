            In May of 1988, we decided that we were going on a trip to Vegas to see our daughter.  So we knew we had to find a new vehicle to go in.  We looked at so many cars that it was beginning to give me a headache just to think about it.

We drove a Dodge Intrepid and fell in love with it.  It rode so smooth and had lots of leg room.  It sits five people very comfortable.  There is even leg room in the back.  Gets 15 miles per gallon of gas in town and about 21 on the road.  (Depending on how fast you drive it.)

It has a heat and air control also in the back to make the trips even more comfortable for the people riding in the back seat.  

The trunk is large and will hold many bags of luggage to go on trips with.  

We have 23,000 miles on the car now and never have had any problems.  I would very much recommend this car to anyone.  I am looking forward to traveling in it this summer to Iowa and also once again to Vegas to see new grandbabies.<br><br>
