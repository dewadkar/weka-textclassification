            I saw this car in the showroom and was amazed at how beautiful the design was, but Lincoln had that reputation of being for older people. I priced other vehicles,  but still kept coming back periodically to see this gorgeous car. After looking at Honda, Nissan, and all the others and seeing that their deluxe models were very expensive, I finally decided to go for the LS. I bought it for the luxury, the superb and unique body style, and the wonderful drive. This car makes driving a pleasure. It's like no other car I've ever owned and actually hard to describe. I would recommend a test drive to experience for yourself. I have a 2000 model and the CD player is in the glove compartment which I believe they have changed for the 2001 models and that will be better...easier to access...also, the gas tank is on the passenger side and I am not used to that..other than these two minor items, everything else is fantastic and I am utterly spoiled. If you like luxury such as automatic lights, windshield wipers, heated seats, etc. then this is the car for you. I can't think of any reason for anyone not to desire a Lincoln LS.<br><br>
