            You really do have to see photos of people holding the DSC-U10 (U10 now for short) in order to appreciate how small this thing is at only 3 1/4 by 1 1/2 inches.  Well, here I am again, Mastercard wigglin' in my wallet, and bought one.  Here's my take on it...

<b>Buying "Tiny"</b>

I've seen the U10 on review sites already, but at the store, saw one on display.  "You've got to be kidding!" was my original thought.  How could a "real" camera be made so small??  Of course, being the sceptic I am, I was convinced this thing must crank out horrible images, similar to the other "pocket sized" digital cameras I've tried over time.  So, out came the plastic, and home the U10 goes with me.

<b>Starting Out</b>

Once you open the box, you're somewhat impressed.  Not only is the tiny camera critter in there, but you get a battery charger and set of 2 AAA sized NiMh rechargeable batteries as well.  This, along with the basics of a good instruction manual, software/drivers, USB transfer cable, memory stick memory card (8 megs), and a neck strap (no wrist strap?  Boo).

Upon reading the manual first thing (yes, you should), I find that you <b>cannot use alkaline batteries</b> in the U10.  You also cannot use lithium or the older style Ni-CD batteries either - you must use the supplied Sony(or other brand) NiMh AAA batteries or the camera may not sense the correct current in order to function properly.  Not really that huge of a problem, but the included charger takes <b>13 hours</b> to charge up two tiny little batteries; better trot over to Wal-mart to buy some more and a speedier charger, folks. 

Ok, so the batteries are charged (via my rapid Radio Shack charger), and in the camera.  Startup is a breeze, by either sliding the cover open or using the power switch on top of the camera to power it up, then with a somewhat familiar Sony menu screen popping up on the tiny little 1 inch LCD on the back.  A tiny toggle switch and two navigation buttons help you move around the menu selections for focusing, image size, and so forth.  The LCD is clear, very bright, and in color, though the color is a bit washed out.  There is no optical viewfinder on something this small, so the LCD is it for composing images, viewing them, etc.

As an auto-focus camera, you need to half-press the shutter and hold it for a second in order for the camera to focus before you finish pressing it to take the shot.  I was impressed with the reliability of the auto-focus system, as some of the photos I tried were in pretty dark rooms that cause my better camera to stumble.  Poof, the tiny flash fires, and my shots are taken.  I could then flip the switch on top of the camera to "play" to view my photos or delete them on the LCD.

<b>The Turnout, Plus Misc.</b>

I cannot comment on the transfer of photos via the supplied USB cable and software, as I always use a USB memory card reader for doing this.  They are quicker, put less wear on the camera, and save the camera's battery power for better things other than downloading photos.

That being said, I found the photos to be pretty good overall.  Online with the best 1.3 megapixel cameras out there?  Nah.  But better than many I've seen. With photos being 1280 x 960 pixels max, this is not a camera you want in order to do 8x10 prints with.  As a matter of fact, the 4x6 inch prints I did on good photo paper while fine for casual use in quality, were still not what I'd call "extremely good".  On-screen images however, looked a good bit better.  There is no zoom on the camera, but it does offer features not common for something like this, such as a burst mode, again - movie clip mode, photo features such as black and white and sepia mode, and more.

The teeny-tiny flash worked fine up to about 6 feet, and did a decent job of bringing out the colors of sheets, flowers, and other bright objects in the house.  Outdoors of course, the camera did better as it doesn't need the flash on a sunny day.  

The camera is capable of doing short 15 second video clips (no sound) but like most other digital cameras that do this, it is nothing close to camcorder quality.  A fun thing to use for video email to grandpa, but the video quality is less than stellar overall.

<b>Final Take</b>

For $199.00, the U10 is just a little high for a 1.3 megapixel camera, however, you're getting something unique in size and let's face it, you PAY for the Sony name, too.

For those wanting something they can literally fit in their pants pocket, to take daily photos with, this is very good.  If you're expecting a camera that's good for cherished wedding photos, or a once in a lifetime vacation photo album, look for something better.  The U10 will crank out "good" images for online viewing, photo slideshows on C.D. disks, and small prints up to no more than 4 x 6 (3.5 x 5 for better quality).  There is of course, no zoom on a camera this small, so this is something else to keep in mind if you like to take photos at places like the zoo, or of wildlife.  No zoom = you moving closer to the subject to take shots, period.

As long as you realize the limits of this little critter, you'll be happy - just don't expect something the size of a large pack of gum to take the place of a $500 camera.  :-)
