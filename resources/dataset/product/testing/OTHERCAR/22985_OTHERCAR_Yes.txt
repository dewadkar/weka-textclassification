                 In today's fast paced, technologically advanced world, it's nice to find a product which you can be out enjoying about 15 minutes after you get the package open. The Polaroid PDC640 is a great camera for beginners and first time buyers as well as the more experienced photographer.
     The owners manual is easy to follow and well written. Additionally, the controls of the camera and the software provided are very user friendly. for example, when first installing the batteries, the camera automatically prompts you for the date and time. From there, you simply decide on the resolution setting and whether to use a flash. Then just point and shoot.
     The camera has an average price tag of about $199. While this price is very affordable, if you are a bargain shopper and have some time, the camera can be found on sale for $149. (Check your local Wal-mart). For those of you who enjoy surfing the web, the camera can be found on many auction sites such as ebay.
     I received this camera as a gift during a party. After a brief skim through the manual, I was out snapping pictures. The party began in the mid-afternoon and went quite late. Most of the guests had a chance to try the Polaroid out and put it through its paces. We tried it in all the different resolution settings as well as indoors, outdoors, day and night shots also. Even the lowest resolution setting provided good quality pictures. If you are printing them out, you will need a good quality printer. I originally used an HP694C printer, and found that only the highest resolution setting produced clear pictures. However, upon upgrading to the HP812C, I was surprised (pleasantly) to find a much clearer print even on the lowest setting.
     The camera comes standard equipped with a 2mb memory card. I strongly recommend getting a larger one, preferably the 8mb. Unfortunately, this is the largest card available for this product. The LCD screen on the back allows you to view pictures and decide whether to save them. This is a very convenient feature, but if the screen is used a lot, be prepared to use quite a few batteries.
     While the camera has been mostly trouble free, I did have a problem transferring pictures to my computer the first time. The original software install was a no-brainer, but I was disappointed upon calling Polaroid tech support only to find they could not help me. I ended up calling a techie at Gateway who knew a bit about these cameras and he straightened out the communication problem. This was my only negative experience with Polaroid. The other times I called, they were very polite and helpful, and had answers to all my questions.
   If you do not have a computer don't worry. The camera comes equipped with a TV hook up for picture viewing, and most film developers can take the images from the memory card and convert them to pictures for you. In addition, if you don't like tying up an extra port on your PC for the connection cable, a floppy disc adapter is available to insert the memory card into the 3.5-inch floppy drive. A quick call to Polaroid will tell you where to find one. The best price I found on the adapter was $70 from an online wholesale company.
     Overall, I would highly recommend this camera. Considering the price and performance of this unit, I believe most people will be very satisfied with this product. Especially those of you who aren't sure if you're ready to give up film, the low cost reduces the risk of disappointment. This camera is also a great item to give to older children or college students. Check one out at your local retailer and enjoy the pictures.
