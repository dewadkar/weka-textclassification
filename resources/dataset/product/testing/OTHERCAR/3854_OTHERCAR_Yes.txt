            a Mercury tracer was the very first car that i bought.  i have to say.. it was a nice car to own too.  i bought a 98 model LS.  It had everything in it. Being a newly graduated student back in 97 i was wowed with all the buttons in it.  Plus i got a good price on it becuase i have a parent who is retired from Ford.  The LS model has power windows and cruise control which are easily accesible.  Nice sound system. and nice interior.  Things i didn't like about the car is that when it rained.. and i had the window cracked just a bit, water would come in and get on the power window buttons.  And my power windows would get stuck on ocassion, but nothin' a nice little pound on the door couldn't handle.  Also, the floor mats would shift constantly.  that got annoying real fast!The car was good on mileage though.  about 320 miles with a full tank. It also had nice pick up and go for a 4 cylinder.  My car was a Four door and it looked too much like a family car plus i needed something with more room.. that's why i got rid of it.  but the 2 years i did own it i enjoyed driving it for the most part.   This car is more geared to people with small families.  i'm still in my 20's, and while i was impressed with all the doo hickies it has.. i wouldn't buy it again. for the simple &quot;cool factor&quot; involved. <br><br>
