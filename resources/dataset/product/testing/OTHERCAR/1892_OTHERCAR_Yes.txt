            The AGFA ePhoto CL18 is a pretty nice little digital camera for the money. It has some very impressive features for it�s size, and an affordable price tag as well. Though this tiny digital camera is probably one of the smallest cameras I�ve ever seen, it comes packed with lots of extras.

For $129.99, I bought the AGFA ePhoto CL18 at Kmart. Packaged with the camera were a softcase, a hand strap, USB cable, video cable, 2 AA batteries, camera mount, users
guide and 2 CDs -  Corel CD-ROM and CL18 Collections CD-ROM. The software included with this camera includes Corel Print Office, Corel Photo House, TWAIN driver, Video for Windows driver, Microsoft NetMeeting, ArcSoft Video Impressions, and AGFAnet Print Service.  

One nice feature of this camera is that it is a dual mode digital camera. Not only is it a portable digital camera for shooting still pictures, but it also has video capture and video conferencing capabilities using the USB included cable.

The camera may be powered by the inexpensive AA batteries, or by using the included USB cable. Though the flash is not functional when plugged into the cable as your power
source, the camera is fully functional as a video conferencing tool, complete with self-timer by using the enclosed tools.

The pictures are of a good quality, although I�ve seen better with some of the higher priced cameras. The non-removable 2MB Flash memory holds 32 standard quality images
or 16 high quality images. Although I�d really prefer a camera with a removable memory, such as the Sony Makiva FD73, I found that it had adequate memory for most purposes.
On the plus side, this is much better quality than the Jam Cam 2.0 Digital Camera which has no flash and extremely poor quality pictures. 

The specifications of this camera include a picture resolution of 640 x 480 pixels which is pretty much standard for the various digital cameras I have used. It comes with a VCA CMOS Image Sensor, a B/W LCD for status display, a bill-in flash, self-timer, auto white
balance, video-out 2.5mm mini plug, video performance up to 15 frames per second, and USB interface.

To make use of all of this camera�s features, the minimum system requirements include Microsoft Windows 98, Pentium processor or higher, free USB port, min 32MB RAM,
100MB of available hard drive space, VGA monitor, 2x or faster CD-ROM. modem or LAN access to the Internet.

The AGFA ePhoto CL18 allows you to do print projects using Print Office 5. You have the option of creating your documents from scratch or using any of their templates. There are a nice variety of templates including greeting cards, invitations and much more.

With the PhotoHouse 5 software, you can edit your images using predefined filters for red-eye reduction, sharpening and color adjustments. It is simple to use and can make a
major difference in the appearance of your pictures. You can even use the AGFA PhotoGenie filter to adjust the colors automatically on the fly.

The included NetMeeting software makes it possible to meet with your family and friends nearly anywhere for video conferencing or chatting. This is a definite plus for this camera and probably one of deciding factors which influenced my decision to buy it.

With the Video Impressions, you can send VideoMail to your friends or even create video movies by using the supplied USB cable. The easy to use photo album makes organizing
your photos and video clips a snap. Just arrange them in any order for easy viewing.

Even though this was not the camera I set out to buy,  I think that this was a terrific buy for the money. With all of these features, how can you go wrong for under $150 for this great little camera and all of the included software? I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who needs a good little camera but doesn�t want to spend the big bucks to get it.
