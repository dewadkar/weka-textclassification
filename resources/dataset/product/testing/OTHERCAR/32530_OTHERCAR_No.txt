            The Good
I went to a Saturn dealership at the recommendation of friends and family as well as the many commercials we all see on TV about the &quot;Different Kind of Company&quot;. The salesperson was polite and laid back and the whole experience was very much what they say it is. I traded in my old Subaru XT coupe, which was not even running at the time, and got $500 for it which was a good deal in my eyes. The first 29K miles were one long Saturn commercial. I was as happy as could be, never having owned a new car before the leather interior and sporty performance were intoxicating. I ranted and raved to everyone I met. I was going to buy a Saturn station wagon when I grew up and had a family. Yada Yada Yada�.

The BAD
At 30K miles the engine seized up without any warning signs. Fortunately I purchased an extended warranty and after a protracted battle with the local dealership and the corporate office they agreed to replace the engine under warranty. The new engine has consistently been losing oil and the dealership has run several oil consumption tests. Latest results show 3.75 quarts lost over 2,545 miles. 

The UGLY (truth about Saturn) 
As I mentioned above I went through a protracted battle with both the Corporate Office (Supposedly Different Car Company) and the local dealership, this was due to the fact that I had been performing all the oil changes myself. Having owned junkers during my college years and having virtually rebuilt the engine in my Subaru you can believe me when I tell you I was treating this car like a king. After all, what could be better then owning a new car that is &quot;cherry&quot; and knowing that it was being properly maintained. Anyway lacking receipts for all the oil and filters they argued that I failed to properly maintain the engine and performed several tests on the oil and engine in an effort to relieve themselves of responsibility. The tension and finger pointing was brutal and my wife was a wreck. 

Ultimately they agreed to replace the engine under warranty but only after putting my wife &amp; I through a stressful and humiliating process. Now the new engine is losing oil and our warranty is running out. The local dealership has performed numerous oil consumption tests and is currently taking the matter to the Corporate Office for recommendations. I am told they will either replace the engine again or �rebuild� it. Owning this car is like sitting on a time bomb. I would NOT recommend buying ANY Saturn to anyone.
