            The Malibu is Chevrolet's first real stab at the compact sedan market; a place that the Accord, Taurus and Camry have been very comfortable in for many years.  I personally own an Accord, and my old man owns the Malibu, so I've had a good chance to ride in both.

The two are very similar in drive, feel, power and interior space.  But the styling on the Malibu leaves a great deal desired.  The interior also isn't very appealing -- GM must have some policy somewhere that the interior of all their cars be similarly mediocre.

There's one thing that you _must_ know before considering this car: the gas can only holds 15 gallons.  If you consider that the gauge shows empty when 3-5 gallons are remaining, you'll find yourself at the pump more often than not.  My dad complains about it all the time -- he's constantly filling it up, even though it gets 20/29 mpg on the road.

I would classify this as a &quot;point A to point B&quot; car and nothing else.  Get in it, drive it, park it.  It has no style, no grace and no exciting power.  Automobiles such as this make me wonder whether they (GM) really do just make cars for rental companies.

If you're considering purchasing a Malibu, I would get in an Accord before you buy: it's a much more refined sedan.<br><br>
