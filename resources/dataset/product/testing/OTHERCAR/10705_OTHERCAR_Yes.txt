            Introduction
I am referring to the amount of megapixels. I�m going to compare my old camera which I have had for about 2 years with one I just bought last week. I have a two year old Olympus D460 digital camera that has 1.3 megapixels, and I just purchased a new Olympus D40 that has 4.0 megapixels. I am using the default HQ picture quality setting on both cameras. The D460 uses a 1280 X 960 setting as its default HQ, with a file size of about 200K, and the D40 uses 2272 X 1704 as its default HQ, with a file size of about 850K. 

Differences In Picture Quality
Let me start out by saying that the D460 is a great camera. The quality of the pictures that I took with the camera were always excellent. That�s until I saw the pictures taken by the D40. The quality is even better. Maybe better by 4 times in sharpness, detail, exposure and color saturation. By having a four times larger file size the information stored is much more. You can only print to 5 X 7 size with the D460, I usually print in 4 X 6 with no problem. With the D40 you can print all the way to a 16 X 20 size. 

Camera Size
This is one of the main reasons I upgraded. I wanted a smaller, more compact camera, without giving up any of features that I had on my older camera. The D40 is small, actually almost as small as a credit card, but a little taller. Very easy to put in your pocket, and carry around anywhere. There is a sliding cover over the lens, no need to worry about a separate lens cover. And when you open the slide cover, the camera is also turned on. No separate on � off switch.

Top LCD Display Vs. The Back Screen
This is one of the most useful features on the D40, and is neglected by most camera manufacturers. It�s also on the D460. I found I loved this readout. The LCD screen shows the picture quality setting, the remaining pictures on your memory card, flash on or off, self timer on � off, etc. This is really handy to glance at the top LCD screen instead of having to turn on the back screen. The LCD is always on whenever the camera is on, and its easier to view in direct sunlight. The back screen sometimes washes out in direct sunlight. This was one of the most important features I looked for when searching for a replacement for my D460.

Holding the Camera
Olympus designed the D40 to be comfortable to hold in 1 hand. The small size allows you to put the camera in your palm. The camera cover has a nice little bulge that your fingers wrap around when the cover is open. The back is also designed with a nice finger hold that your thumb rests on. It is very comfortable. Be sure when your comparing cameras that you hold each to see if they are comfortable. The zoom lever is located on top, around the button that you push to take your pictures. The zoom lever is comfortable and easy to operate. The D40 has a 3 to 1 optical zoom, which can be viewed thru the viewfinder or on the screen in back. 

10 Position Exposure Dial
This is something new on the D40 that wasn�t on my D460. The purpose of this dial is to have an easy way to shoot in different circumstances, without going through all the button pushes on the menu. 
Auto Mode setting:
There is an auto mode setting, which you would normally leave in that position all the time. The auto setting will adjust everything without any settings on your part. 
Landscape Mode Setting:
Another choice is the landscape mode. Useable when you�re shooting a lot of scenery. The camera adjusts for a higher depth of field, allowing for sharper pictures to infinity. 
Portrait Mode Setting:
This is important to use if your taking a picture of 1 or a few people, and you want them in focus, but you want the background out of focus. Works great. Of course you could do all the manual adjustments on your camera if your camera had that ability to change the f stops or shutter speeds, but how likely are you to actually do the changes as your taking pictures if the settings are too difficult to get to. With the D40 all you have to do is move the dial around to the picture of the person, and your done. That was easy. You will actually use this.

Smartmedia
Olympus uses smartmedia storage cards. Easy to find, very small, and most important, very low cost. A 128meg card goes for as little as $49.00. Make sure you have  a few with you when you go out with your camera.

Batteries
Uses 2 AA lithium or nickel medal hydride rechargeable batteries. You can find AA�s anywhere. Very important if your batteries run out unexpectedly. Lots of cameras use proprietary batteries, that are expensive and very hard to find. Its easier when your visiting or traveling to rely on AA�s.

Leather Case
Don�t go crazy looking for a case to put your new camera in. I bought the one made by Olympus especially for the D40. Soft leather, with a belt loop and has a zippered pocket to keep an extra set of batteries, and a few memory cards. Most important is that it is very small and looks great.
