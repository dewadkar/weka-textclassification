            I recently purchased this product after researching all sorts of digital cameras.  It is a great camera and so easy to use.  The quality of the photos is wonderful and for someone who knows very little about traditional photography, this camera has opened my eyes to a whole new world.  The only negatives I have found are that the camera is very sensitive to cold weather so I have to be careful when taking photos outside since I live in Montana and the software needed to download the photos works great on most platforms except Windows NT.  I strongly recommend buying rechargeable digital batteries - store bought batteries only last a bout an hour compared to the rechargeable ones which last from 3 hours to 7 hours before needing to be recharged.  I also recommend that you buy a larger flash card since the 8 MB flash card that comes with it will only hold about 12 photos at medium resolution - I bought a 32 MB card and at medium resolution I can take 62 photos which work fine for what I need them for.  I was reluctant to go with a digital camera only in the respect that the resolution in the past hasn't been where it needs to be for printing purposes but this camera is there and for the price, is great.  I highly recommend this camera.  <br><br>
