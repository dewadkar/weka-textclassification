            I have always secretly lusted for a Jeep.  When it came to choosing 
between my fiancee and getting the Jeep, I chose the Jeep.  I regret 
losing her, but love the Wrangler SE for it's crude and uncomplicated 
nature which stood in stark contrast to her refined sophistication.  
The power from it's humble 4 banger is adequate for any task except 
towing the big stuff (trailers, bayliners).  &lt;p&gt;
The rag top is very versatile.  I use a tonnea over the back with 
the stock top and 
drive it topless/safari style for most of the year (New England).  
It is mechanically easy to work on.  The only modifications I have made 
are a modest 2&quot; lift and larger tires.  I have had no mechanical problems 
and the vehicle requires only the usual oil change/lube.
