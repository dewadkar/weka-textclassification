            I bought this Digital so I could share pictures with Family and Start selling on Ebay. Much more compacted then getting a Scanner too! 

I had very good Experience as soon as I got it...was really had no idea what to do with my self or the Camera...But I can't believe how easy it was!  Took and sent Pictures Via email on the first try which I really planned on a all nighter in front of the computer with my New Camera.  It took no time at all!  I am Already on ebay bidding for another to get for a gift for someone!  It is perfect and not costly! 


I have had no experience before with Digital's so I personally think this is perfect for anyone especially if they are new at the whole thing as I was it is so easy to use.  They go for around $129 on different web sites as I got mine for $60 off Ebay brand new in box. You can also find accessories for the camera on Ebay as well.  


Most Camera's come already with the Camera, Battery, Software to install, 2mb memory card, Cable to hook camera to your computer, camera case and also Quick Start and Trouble shooting brochure then the Quick Guide that is simple to follow. I will probably upgrade to a Camera that you can view pictures right away in time but for now I am really happy with what I have!  Overall I would say the Dimera 3500 is Perfect for Beginners!!  <br><br>
