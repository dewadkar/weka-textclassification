            I picked up the car at a VW dealership in Philadelphia with 17 miles on its otodometer on Saturday May-26-2001. On 18th mile the "Check engine" light turned on, I returned to the dealership, but the service was not working at the hour already.

It was Memorial Week-end... The service took the car 3 days later on Tuesday, 05/29/2001. It appeared there were 4 error codes in the onboard computer caused by lean condition, so the dealership fixed vacuum lean from hose to fuel tank to conister, fixed leak, and replaced front oxigen sensor.

The above is hardly expected from a brand new car, especially German VW new car for $20000.

Well, I've covered 300 miles so far mostly on the highway, the 1.8T engine really accelerates the car once engine's RPM are in 3000-4000 range....

VW put Continental EcoContact tires on the car and a softer suspension compared to year 2000. The combination provides soft and quite ride, however road feeling and handling is not for fans, especially for 1.8Turbo engine. If you buy a powerfull engine, look at the OEM installed tires as well.

And the ride... Forget about Focus, Protege, Corolla...

And the brakes... I always watch in back mirror before really pressing the brake pedal, 4 disk breaks with distributed break effect are highly efficient. Also ABS hardware seem to apply maximum brake effect to rear wheels first, the car's nose does not dive for easy to moderate deaccelerations, that highly increases driving comfort, especially in town, as you won't be made sick.

The car now has 2400 miles on it and went through an oil change at 1200 miles and installation of mud guards. Runs very well.

I drive to work, the car puts 425 miles per 12 gallons of A-93 fuel per week or 35 miles/gallon. The car is driven at about 60-70 miles per hour on the highway without air conditioning to get the result.

The car now has 36000 miles on it. The car demonstrated the known coilpack problems, VW replace them on first notice on powertrain warranty. No other issues with the car at the moment, and since the original problems at the time of purchase runs very nicely.
