            The problem with buying a car is, you have to make compromises.  If you go after a sports car, you'll get great performance, but you are going to give us ride quality and roominess.  If you go after a small car, you are going to get great gas mileage, but also low performance.  

Someone forgot to tell this to the people at Acura.  

With the Integra GS-R, they have taken the best qualities of a sports-car, the performance and styling, and combined them with the best quality of a smaller car, great gas mileage.

The result is a car that has almost as much power as a base Camaro or Mustang, while also getting almost the same gas mileage as a Honda Civic.  

It doesn't stop there.  Since it is an Acura, you get almost bulletproof reliability.  The bad news is maintenance and repairs are high, but then again the odds are you'll be paying mostly for maintenance only.  

You say you like to customize your car?  Then get an Integra GS-R.  Besides perhaps the Honda Civic, no car model has more aftermarket parts available for it than the Integra series.  Also many parts can be interchanged between the Acuras and Hondas.  For example the pistons from a Honda Del Sol can be added to an Integra GS-R, and due to their domed head, instantly give the GS-R a 1-point bump in compression.

The only serious knocks against this car are high insurance rates, and paint that fades badly, at least on non-metallic paint jobs.  Also the GS-R needs premium gas, and if you drive alot like I do, an extra 15-20 cents a gallon adds up quick.  

Want to go from 0-60 in less than 8 seconds?  Want to get over 30 MPG?  Then get an Integra GS-R, and get ready to drive around grinning like an idiot.
