             If you are looking for a good driving, comfortable, smooth riding, and some what cheap then I would suggest a 77 Lincoln Continental. My wife and I bought a Continental for $1400.00 and it was a great investment. You might think well I don�t want a car that old, well let me be the first to say I really like it. The continental is roomy, you can fit six people comfortably and with a 460, and a 4-barrel carburetor it can pick up and go.

The only thing I don�t like about it is how much gas it uses. Its frame is durably built so we feel safe in it. Once someone backed up into us and our bumper was just a little scratched and the other gentlemen�s car was dented pretty badly. With some of the newer cars I do not feel as safe, because of the lack of metal in the car and the size of the newer ones is too small. I know in my Continental that if I was to get into an accident I know that we would probably survive and be all right. In a small newer car I do not feel like there is much chance for survival.
