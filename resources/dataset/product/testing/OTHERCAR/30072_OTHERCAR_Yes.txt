            Such a nice camera, small, compact, and one of the best.  I bought this digital camera about half a year ago and it utilizes the USB port.  It would be better if it could use firewire port which I have on my computer.  I use this as often as possible, and with my printer which prints at photo quality.  It came with a 16MB memory card, more than any other company.  Flash and the zoom work great, and the utilizing of no film saves money.  Buy this product because it looks good, and is worth it in the long run.  To get the best deal, I recommend that you go to an online store such as buy.com to get the best deal.  I got it for 550, which was the best price around.  Do not go to retail stores, since they sell it for a very expensive price.  Enjoy!<br><br>
