Last December, I received the camera as a gift.  I was thrilled at finally getting into the digital revolution.  I am now questioning my prior emotions.  I am not an avid photographer actually I used to hate taking photos.  I was under the impression that a digital camera would be more convenient and less costly.  Both of those are true, but the images are not nearly as clear as a 35mm camera.

To make things simple I would like to outline the benefits of the Agfa digital camera versus a standard 33mm camera;

Pros 
1) Get to view the images instantly with the digital camera
2) Can delete images that you do not like, and don�t have to pay for developing.
3) For people who like toys, it is just that
4) Very easy to upload images to a computer, then on to an email or printer

Cons
1) Printing a digital image is just as costly as 33mm
2) Memory packs run out of space quickly (unless you take poor resolution photos)
3) No zoom.  The camera lets you crop an image and then increase the size, but that is not the same as a zoom.
4) The initial cost of the camera is much more expensive than a standard 33mm

Assuming the choice is not between digital and 33mm here are the pros and cons of the Agfa digital camera versus other digital cameras.

Pros
1) Uses standard AA batteries.  A 4 pack of AA from Radio shack with a charger costs about $20
2) Easy to use.  The controls are simple.
3) USB port makes it very easy to upload images to a computer.  The S-Video makes it simple to view images on a tv.
4) Low cost � About $250

Cons
1) Poor image quality

I hope I have helped with your decision.
