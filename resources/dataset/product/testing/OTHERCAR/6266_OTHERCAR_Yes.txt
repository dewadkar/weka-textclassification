            My tale takes place back in the heady days of 1999, the Devil's year.  I remember it as if it was yesterday, which it was not, because it was last year, but in my memory, it resides next to my birth, after the loss of my virginity, and before my first acid trip.  I just wanted to make those things clear.

As you may have guessed, I own a forest green Hyundai Accent with the grey-ish interior.  Not charcoal grey, but light grey.  It has very little power, but when it is able to go when the light turns green.

I aquired my Hyundai after my previous car, a 1988 Toyota Celica was taken from me, one might say purloined, while I was recovering from a particularly bad breakup in Philadelphia, the city of not so brotherly anything.  It cost $8,000, which is not very much for a car.

Strangely enough, and this just occurs to me as I am recording this for posterity, this story about my Hyundai is inherently bound to that very same breakup which lead to it's coming into my life!  How astounding!

Ahem.

On the evening of May 4, 1999, I dreamt that I had a glorious reconciliation with an ex-girlfriend of mine.  After years of bitterness and hatred, we came to terms over a cup of oh-so-fine joe, and were reunited both spiritually and physically, much to the joy of my long ignored little soldier.  When I awoke on the morning of the 5th, I was so pleased with this dream that I bounded out of bed, down the stairs, and into my economically compact Hyundai so that I could get to work, bright and early, and send off an e-olive branch of love and forgiveness.

As I drove, in second gear, up the hill which led to the highway, I imagined the passionate embraces that I would soon be sharing in details so fine and accurate that my windows soon fogged over, hiding the world and the various cars parked in my way.

And then, I was struck by an amazing realization.

I, I thought to myself, am no longer sitting with my legs hanging down and my head facing forward, as one would normally sit.  Instead, I am sitting with my head on the surface of the concrete, and my legs dangling above me.  Also, there is coffee dripping on my face from the now sideways coffee cup which has become wedged in the cup holder.

Yes, dear readers, my car was upside down.

How did this occur?  Surely, I do not know!  One moment, I was driving along, happily whistling and touching myself, and the next, my car was tossed as if by God himself!

I did what any sensible person would do and crawled out and away from the car, coming to rest a few meters away so that I could see my poor car, rocking gently back and forth on it's plast-o-metalic hood.  

Oh dear, I thought.  

My first instinct was to push my car back onto it's wheels and drive away as quickly as possible.  I was unable to act on this plan, however, due to the large number of police and fire officers who appeared.   They bustled about, pushed me around, poked me, prodded me, and required me to answer a series of humiliating questions.  

And at the end, they left, car in tow.   

I was alone.

Now, to make a needlessly long story short, I will tell you one more thing which will crystalize for you why I whole heartily endorse the Hyundai Accent (in whichever color most pleases you or your girlfriend.)  Today, September 25, 2000, I drove that same car to my place of employment which is not even in the same state as my previous place of employment, that place which you may remember, I was driving to on the morn' of my fateful accident!

How is this possible?

That, my friends, is the magic of the Hyundai Accent.
