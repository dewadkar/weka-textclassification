            Upon buying this camera I took pictures of every possible thing I could think of. The clarity of this camera is amazing for a 1 mega-pixel camera.The only downside to this is when you switch to the highest quality it gets kind of blurry on some pictures. When I take pictures I leave the resolution on &quot;standard&quot; and the quality on &quot;best&quot;, with these options it takes a perfect picture each time. Another downside to the camera is the battery life. When you use the video mode the battery drains really fast. The best way to avoid running though batteries is to use the rechargable batteries that are included and turn the camera off when your not using it. Other than those few downsides this is a really good camera.<br><br>
