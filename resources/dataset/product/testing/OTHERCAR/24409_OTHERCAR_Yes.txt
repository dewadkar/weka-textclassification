            We bought our stylish 1992 Buick LeSabre used, in 1998.  This car is one of the nicest driving, riding and dependable cars we have had.  The ride is smooth and comfortable, and it handles very nicely, even on gravel and with adverse road conditions.  The power driver's seat is a dream, just wish it had one for the passenger, although that seat does recline.  The back seat is roomy and comfortable and the trunk is very large and deep.  The LeSabre gets great gas mileage for a mid-sized car, even loaded down.  It cruises at &quot;any&quot; speed and it can outrun most anything.

We have had a lot of different vehicles over the years, cars, trucks, mini-vans and sport utility and I have to say, the comfortable ride, roomy interior and features, this vehicle rates at the top.  However, the car being low to the ground, for me is a disadvantage.  It is hard for me to get out of.  I have trouble with my hip and knee, I drive about an hour one way to work. When I get out, I am stiff anyway and getting &quot;up and out&quot; the the LeSabre is not always easy for me (Much easier to &quot;slide&quot; out of the taller pickups and suv's).  

I drive about 10 miles per day on a gravel road which is not very well maintained.  This was one of our concerns when we purchase this vehicle.  We weren't sure if we'd be getting stuck a lot, or even be able to drive all the way home.  But so far, even in mud and snow, the LeSabre has gotten us through, love that front-wheel drive!  The County reconstructed about a forth our of a mile of our road a couple years ago and this car has taken the challenge of bad weather great.  The only time I was unable to get up our hill was when no one else could (We had had about 6 - 10 inches of snow and high winds.  

Purchasing this car used, we had expected a few repairs, but we have only replace the alternator and water pump, and of course a new set of tires this year.  It has been very economical to drive.  It is a little &quot;windy&quot; meaning it is not as quite as it was probably when it was new.  I am sure if we replaced the weather stripping, this sound would be eliminated.  But when listening to the radio, I tend to forget it (although my husband doesn't)

We have taken this car on several long trips and are well satisfied.  It  has over 150,000 miles on it now and we are still not afraid to take off in it.

We do tend to use it as our &quot;truck&quot;.  It is easier to drive and much more comfortable (AC) than our 70 Ford pickup.  We have made several trips with a kennel &amp; puppies to the airport and to meet buyers; to the State &amp; County fair with rabbits and cages; and a weekly trip home from work with a variety of &quot;feed and stuff&quot; (dog, cat, poultry, rabbit, etc.,etc.,).  Even with all this weight, it still handles very nicely.  I usually put the bags in the back seat as it is easier to remove them and less worry about tearing a bag.  I consider them my &quot;passengers&quot; and usually distribute them on each side.  The car tends to squat when we &quot;load&quot; it up for a trip, but that is to be expected, as it is not a &quot;truck&quot;.  

For everything we do, a truck or SUV would be a better buy, but at the time, finances kept us at this level of purchase price, while still getting the room and I really don't regret it.  It has been our best value (short of being a truck).  If I were to purchase another new or used CAR, it would definitely be a Buick LeSabre.       

And one last thing (I promise).... Christmas 1998, we were rear-ended by a 4wd pickup at a stop sign.  We had damage to the trunk lid, the right rear quarter panel, and tail lights.  We were able to drive it home and to work before we got it fixed.  Then the Summer of 1999, I hit a deer on the way home from work.  Took out my headlights, crinked my hood and front quarter panels.  We were afraid of damage under the hood, so it stayed home while waiting on a repair date.  Lucky for us, the only thing was the compressor for the air conditioner.  After repairs of both accidents, this car doesn't rattle or anything, it's as sound as ever.  And the paint matched wonderfully and you really can't tell we had any repairs done.<br><br>
