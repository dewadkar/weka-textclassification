            Sure, the buying experience is really refreshing and the price can't be beat.  But if a couple specific things bother you in a car, you'll want to know about them first.

We bought our 1995 SL new, with a manual transmission and a minimum of options, and it is still running great 5 years later with routine maintenance.  We enjoyed getting the coffee mug, don't mind the copious mailings, but were kind of embarrassed by the salespeople all gathering around as we &quot;drove it off the showroom floor.&quot;  Knowing what you're going to pay, though, is such a relief!

However, there are two minor problems which could make a difference in your decision to buy this car.  First, it sits low.  If you are a tall or lanky person, getting in and out will be awkward and your legs will grow uncomfortable on long trips.

Second, it sort of eats oil, which we have been told is not just our car but an ongoing problem.  You will need to keep putting extra oil in it (we bought a case just to have around the house.) It's an inconvenience.

Other than that, we've been satisfied.<br><br>
