            I bought the HP C200 by accident. I was really just wanting to upgrade my
printer to a better 'Photo Quality&quot; one. The rep from the factory was in the store and answered all my questions about the printer and then added that HP was having a special, the printer with the camera with a rebate. I 
already have 2 digital cameras so I wasn't too interested. He proceeded to take some pictures with the camera and print them off. Well as the old saying goes, &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot; I was sold. I have digital cameras that cost 3X as much and don't have near the quality off the C200. I would recommend it to anyone who is either a beginner or semi pro. It is easy to use and light to carry. I can place it in my purse for those unexpected opportunities for a fun shot. I am waiting for the new model to come out so I can try it also. It is also handy to just 'pop' it
into the printer and print out the photo without the computer....<br><br>
