            I had planned to put off writing this review until I had the truck at least a month, but I am so enthusiastic about it after only 2 day that I feel compelled to go ahead.

It was time to replace the 92 Grand Voyager w/ 114k miles and, being tired of minivans, we'd decided we wanted to at least look at a large SUV.  We drove the Expedition and the Navigator, and a 5.3L Yukon XLT, and looked at the Sequoia before deciding that 240 hp just wasn't enough for a vehicle of that size.

It was a no-brainer.  The one relative positive for the Expedition is the advantage in cargo cap. with the 3d row seats deployed. Against that one plus, the Denali's ride and on-road handling (disclaimer: we have no intention of using this $40k+ vehicle off-road!), superior power, and comfort simply blew away the Fords in our estimation.  And the difference in performance between the 6.0L engine in a Denali and the 5.3L that is the largest engine available in a Yukon was worth the extra couple thousand cost differential between the Denali and comparably-equipped  Yukon XLT.

The Denali is powerful, smooth, nimble, and has a very nice luxury-car-quality ride that is unbelievable in a vehicle designed to tow over 8000lbs.  Truly an outstanding piece of engineering.  The leather is of a very good quality, it has all the amenities like heated, power-adjustable seats with lumbar and side-bolster controls, and the sound system is the best stock system I've yet heard in a car.

I could go on and on, talking about how the active suspension smooths out bumpy roads and reduces body sway in turns, and how good the brakes are, and how much more confident I felt driving the Denali than I did the Expedition, but....  I will only say that even with a special price we could get on the Eddie Bauer which would have allowed us to purchase it for perhaps $5k less than the Denali, it was still a no-brainer once we both drove the car.
