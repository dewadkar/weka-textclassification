            Well, Honda's aren't known for their engines. The 1.6-liter, non-VTEC engine producing 106-peak horsepower and
103-maximum foot-pounds of torque is proof of that. And before I get yelled at, I must add a disclaimer, that hey, the figures aren't really that bad. But as Honda drivers can testify, you'll fully know what I mean when you're going up a hill. (Where's the low-end torque I ask!)

But seriously, I still like the car. Although it can be overpriced, the ergonomics and comfortability can't be argued. There's plenty of room, the seat is firm, yet accommodating and leg and headroom aren't issues. I recently went on a road trip to Idaho, and I was surprisingly pretty comfortable. The style of the car, although becoming extremely outdated, still manages to look classy and sleek. Plus I gotta admit I love the excellent suspension tuning and the responsive steering.
 
Unfortunately, with the good characterists comes the bad. In the form of poor transmission, and loud outside noise, not to mention the weak engine the Honda loses serious points. And yes, it was overpriced.

However, The 2000 Honda Civic is exactly what it is...a Consumer Car. It gets good gas mileage, and it's comfy and..well it gets you from point A to point B extremely well. 

It's not a bad car, or a particularly fun one to drive. But I still enjoy it and relish the interior, ergonomics and the still good Honda quality. All I can say is...pray for a town with not very many hills and let's remember to bless the resale gods, because Honda's high resale value is important. Bottom line...You pay alot of money for not as much cool stuff.
