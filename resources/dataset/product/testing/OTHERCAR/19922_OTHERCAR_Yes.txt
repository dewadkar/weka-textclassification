            I've owned many vehicles in my lifetime, and have always been a &quot;car nut&quot;.  I prize appearance, dependability and performance, and had therefor been quite suspicious of Jaguar, given its apparently well-earned reputation for quality shortcomings.  But when I could not swing a satisfactory deal from Mercedes when I sought to renew a lease on my E420 Sport, I remembered the raves a friend had given his S-Type. I  also knew that the quality reputation had improved. 

I went to a Jaguar showroom and proceeded to fall in love with this vehicle.  It looks like nothing else on the road, especially from the front.  Since I acquired it, not a day has gone by that someone (or two or three) has not complimented the looks of the car.  Thus far (11k) it has been mechanically perfect.  Its ride is supple, the power (I have the 4.0)more than adequate, and the handling excellent.  

My only complaint is with the lack of storage space in the cabin and the silly shifter.  I would warn big folks to try the car on for size.  My wife and I find it plenty roomy, and the fold down back seats compensate for the only average-size trunk.  All in all, the car is on track for favorable comparison with the car I now rank as the best I've ever owned, a 1992 Lexus SC400. But I drove that to 82,000 miles without a complaint!<br><br>
