            WHY? Our family needed a replacement vehicle for our 1989 Mazda mini-van, the MPV. The family wanted the 4WD option for winter ski trips and I wanted a comfortable ride - not the bumpy ride I get, for instance, in my son's Ford Ranger pickup. I felt that same bumping ride test-driving a truck-based SUV like the Ford Explorer. Test-driving the (Toyota Camry) car-based Lexus gave me the smooth and quiet ride I wanted. Being a short adult, I also don't like having to scale a running board to get into the front seats. Think of this vehicle as a stylish mix of a station wagon and an SUV. 

LOVE! The Lexus is a quality-built vehicle with a lot of driver and passenger comfort - most comfortable with 3 other passengers. The service is professional and dedicated. Spare tire is a full-sized regular tire. (I was surprised to learn the Mercedes (!)SUV has only one of those rinky-dink replacement tires to get you to the tire shop.)

HATE! This SUV has a wide turning radius (adds to stability) - remember those 3-pt turnarounds we learned in driver's training years ago? Well, that skill comes in handy with this Lexus. And even though the vehicle is car-based, you can't take tight curvy roads as fast as you can in a car. There is also a lot of wind reverberation when the rare windows are rolled down. It has the limited cargo space of a station-wagon. We use a Thule cargo carrier on top of the car for skis and stuff.

The price of the vehicle does makes me think twice about handing the keys over to my sons when they need the car. Image-wise I think they prefer the rugged looks of the Ford Explorer, but they do like the Lexus.
