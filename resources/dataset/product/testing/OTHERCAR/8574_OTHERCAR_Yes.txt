            I own a blue/green 1994 Pontiac Grand Am GT and it has been very reliable for me. I absolutely love it! This car has been a joy to drive ever since I purchased it used in 1998. I have only had to replace the alternator and maintain regular upkeep(oil changes, etc) to keep this beauty running. I live in the Southeast where it rains quite often and have never had traction or handling problems with this car.

The ride is smooth in the city, yet there is enough power in the Quad 4 engine to pass effectively on the highway. This car seats four people comfortably and a fifth can be squeezed into the middle back seat for short journeys. 

My particular model came with the window crank which was disappointing to me at first, but I have learned from other Grand Am owners that Pontiac is infamous for their failing power window systems. 

The major thing that I do not like about this car is the price of the tires. The GT model requires the sporty tires which are much more expensive than the regular tires that the SE model is equipped with. 

I do love the sporty look of the GT model with its flashy spoiler and ground effects.
