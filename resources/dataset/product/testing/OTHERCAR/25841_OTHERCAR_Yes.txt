            If you are thinking about purchasing a Jeep Cherokee I would say that is a good idea.  If you are a parent they offer excellent family items like four doors, large trunk space, and great fuel economy.  They are also good for the teenager who is looking for just the right car.  This Jeep offers luxury as well as style.  Breaking down will never be a problem.  The Cherokee is a very dependable vehicle.  I know because I have driven mine for 128,000 miles and no major problems yet, if any at all.  If you're looking to take the vehicle off-road then get prepared because this bad boy is going to take all that you can give it.  It's four-wheel drive controls are excellent and who wants another sport utility when you can have the Jeep.  The company name's been around for years so they know how to make a good vehicle to suit almost everyone's needs.<br><br>
