            With it's sharp integrated lines and nice power base, the V-6 Accord coupe is a automobile with some great possibilities. This article is for those of us who love to start with a well rounded automobile and make it into a customized dream.

There are two things that I consider when purchasing a car for modifications. First, there is the concern about accessible aftermarket parts and companies. As we all know, parts for Hondas and Acuras are like going down to the store and buying milk. For the exterior we can find parts from Wings West or Aerobuni. This will allow for that customized sleek look, if that's what your looking for. Items such as front ends, rear spoilers, side skirting and rear valances. Basically you can do whatever your heart desires with this machine. Performance wheels are easily accessible which can allow your car to take on a whole new persona.
Next, there is the whole go fast idea. With the Accords 200bhp register this makes for a very good place to start. For those of use who love those handy bolt-on performance modifications we have plethera of companies to choose from.Parts ranging from complete cat-back exhaust systems to intakes to headers, anything that can be easily installed. My personal favorites are DC Sports and Hks. For the guys and girls that like to take a step further and start tweeking that famous V-tech DOHC, that opens a whole new world of performance. You will need to contact your nearest dynojet machine found at www.dynojet.com. This machine is used to measure your cars performance and response to modification. Things that can be accomplished are the advance\retard of your engines timing. The advance/retard of the intake cam and exhaust cam. With Honda's very flexible ECU programming, even your fuel to oxygen ratios can be altered.(Please leave this in the hands of trained professional, serious damage to your engine can result if done incorrectly). With these simple modifications your can can perform on a whole new level, for a minimal amount of cash.

In all the Accord V-6 coupe is a very solid car, and it can handle just about whatever your mind can throw at it.
