            The valet at the Chateau on the Lake (Branson, MO) asked "what kind of car is this?"  I replied that it was a Chrysler.  "You're much too young to be driving a Chrysler" he said...I just turned 50, so I needed that!  But I was puzzled.  He was right..I HAD bought a..(gulp) C-h-r-y-s-l-e-r!

Our dealer (Jacky-Jones Chrysler-Plymouth, Hayesville, NC) was quick to mention that Daimler based this vehicle on an existing Mercedes chassis and drivetrain, and I can certainly feel that in the handling of this new type of LUV (Luxury Utility Vehicle).  Additionally the quality of plastics, rubber, and resins used give my 2004 Pacifica a more solid "feel" than others in it's class.  We do a lot of extensive traveling across the US, and bought this for long trips.  With it's numerous power outlets I can operate my mini-fridge, and laptop computers while watching the DVD in the back seat while my wife drives.  Incidently she is not a fan of oversized vehicles, but loves to drive the Pacifica.

Plenty of room for extra passengers, and cargo (depending on rear seats up or down)..best of all comfort is superb!  Just about the most comfortable and smooth car I have owned.

Acceleration is fully adequate..but I'm not trying to win any races..it's still solid, not sluggish, just confident. Silky transmission even on our gravel mountain roads. 

One of the previous reviewers is right about the fully opened sunroof...the air circulation gets all weird, and it plays havoc on your ears..like a jack-hammer..and the tire pressure warning light is tooooo sensitive.  If one of the tires drops below a certain threshold the warning message appears..and it's very persistant.  I'm told that Chrysler will have a "re-flash" for that later this year.

Overall I like the 2004 Pacifica a lot.  Test drive one, and you'll put it on your short list, and probably get one!
