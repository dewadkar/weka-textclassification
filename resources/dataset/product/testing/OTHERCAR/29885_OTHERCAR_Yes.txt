                 I bought a 1992 Cutlass Supreme LE in February of 1999. I knew it was used with excessive mileage on it but yet I had to have it. Now I am thankful that I did because it is one of the best cars that I have ever driven and I don't say that lightly. It rides smoothly and drives even better. The inside instrument panel is a dream as well, with everything there where I can easily reach it. From the time that I bought it, until now, I have had to do some &quot;minor&quot; repairs to it but it has never let me down. Most people can't say that about some cars and I know because there's been some lemons in my life, when it came to cars.
     The only shortcoming I can see in the Olds is the sponginess of its breaking system. You have to plan ahead to stop because the breaks will not stop you &quot;on a dime&quot; so to speak. I have had more breaks put on my Olds twice and also had new rotors put on, to no avail. It still breaks like it did so I know now the breaking system is like that all the time. But, really, that is the only shortcoming I can find in the car. So if you are thinking of buying, you won't go wrong buying an Olds.<br><br>
