            I think this is one of the best car's ever made! I am gonna buy one myself when the lease on my jeep runs out.I have checked them out thoroughly, and it has everything you would ever want in a car. There is also a big back seat (two of them that fold down) so if you want to get back there with a hot and sexy chick there is plenty of room! The best feature is that it is a monster vehicle! If I ever get hit by another car or truck, they are doomed! Another good thing is that the Infiniti stereo system that you can get put in by Dodge is really great. I also think this is one of my favorite features! You could also run over basically anything that you want to! And this monster can tow up to 7,650 lbs with its possible 5.9L V8! The Durango is a great car and I highly recommend it!
