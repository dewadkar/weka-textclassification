            After owning the Fuji MX1200 for well over a year now, as well as having several other more expensive models by Canon and Olympus at my disposal through work, I find it hard to find anything but praise to write regarding the MX1200. This handy, compact camera has seen over 5000 miles in the saddlebags of my motorcycle, as well as several ski trips and countless trade shows, etc...I just can't seem to be able to break this thing, no matter how I try! Picture taking is incredibly simple, and the images rival those from our $900 Olympus at work! I have noted in several reviews that people are unhappy with the serial download speeds, however this tends to be the norm with all digital cameras - I also obtained the FlashPath floppy-disc adapter with my camera and have cut my transfer time by easily 80%. If I had to put my finger on one downfall to this camera, it would be in regards to extreme macros (under 10" or so) that tend to be tricky to set up in regards to proper lighting, otherwise this camera has performed beautifully in almost every situation I have used it in. Lately, I have been seeing this camera available through auction and clearance sites for approximately $125, and even at the $250 I originally paid for mine, I would consider this to be one of the true VALUES available in the digital camera market.
