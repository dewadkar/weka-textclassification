            It was lust at first sight when, three years ago, I saw a beautiful little two seat roadster with a HARDTOP that folded almost invisibly into the trunk with the touch of a button. On a practical basis that hard top provides the weather tightness and security (and freedom from slashes) that a 'ragtop' does not. On an aesthetic basis , when the top is up the car has an appealing profile that the is unmatched by the slightly strange BMW Z3 profile and 'ok' look of the Porsche Boxster. 

The car is a blast to drive. With the top down and the 6 speaker Bose sound system belting out my favorite music I think my grin stretches from one side of the car to the other. The engine, according to the specs, has a very broad, flat peak torque range (200 lb/ft from 2500 - 5300 rpm) The car takes off like a jack rabbit (without wheel spin - probably because of the 225/45ZR tires on the 17&quot; alloy wheels with which my SLK is equipped) and sticks like glue.

The seating position is much more comfortable (to me at 5'7&quot;) than that in the Z3 or the Boxster and the dash has a pleasing retro look with easy to see, understand and operate controls.

This car is very civilized with almost every amenity. However, I find it strange that it the seats are not powered, the antennae does not retract and the climate control is not automatic since my big car(which cost about $10,00 less in '96) has those features.On the other hand there are two slide out cup holders in the top of the dash which work very ell. Further, even with the top up the trunk space is VERY small. With the top down the trunk space is almost non-existent.

While the SLK may not be as fast as the Porsche or (arguably)handle as well as the Z3 it is, on balance of cost, performance and beauty, the 'pick of the litter.'<br><br>
