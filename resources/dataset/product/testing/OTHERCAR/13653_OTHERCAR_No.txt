            This vehicle has had more recalls, more mechanical (engine) trouble and un-diagnosable errors than any vehicle I've ever owned. In addition, the parts are hard to find and are quite expensive. When I've tried to get a "loaner car" to hold me over, I've been told that Kia no longer gives them out. No wonder! They probably can't afford to give out THAT many loaners! I'm very disappointed with my Sportage's reliability, lack of power, poorly crafted parts and their layout, it's lack of good gas mileage and the overall satisfaction I've had with it. It's only good points are the roominess and it's looks. Other than that, it's really not been a good deal for me. As you can read from other epinions I'm not alone. I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.
