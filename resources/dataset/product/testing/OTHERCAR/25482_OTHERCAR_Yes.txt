            We bought our first Saturn in the fall of 1991.  It was a brand new make and model!  We LOVED it.  It was listed as an SL, but because it was so new, we also had power steering included. We have not had any problems with it, and 138,000 miles later, our son is driving it!

We liked that car so much that we bought an SL in the fall of 1993.  This car too, has been virtually care free.  The only extra maintenance needed were spark plug wires.

Since we had so much good in the first two Saturns, we bought our third one in the winter of 1997.  This has been the best one yet. The ride is smooth. The heater works GREAT! Which is important in Michigan in the winter! 

We have driven all these cars on road trips of 1000 miles or more. We have NO complaints.

Lately, our son has gotten too tall to ride in the rear seat, but since he doesn't live here anymore, that is not a problem. In fact, that is about the only thing wrong with a Saturn.  Too little leg room in the rear.

Overall, I'd buy a Saturn EVERY time!  Our daughter even bought one!<br><br>
