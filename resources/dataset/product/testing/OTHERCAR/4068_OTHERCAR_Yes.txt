            Having now owned this vehicle for a little more than a year, I can honestly say that this was the right vehicle for the family and it has performed well.

We originally selected this van over the others because of superior features, bargain pricing, and power under the hood.

We were looking for a vehicle that offered second row captains chairs and the Venture at the time was the only one from the factory that offered them.  We also wanted a vehicle that had more than cubby hole space behind the 3rd row and the Venture is very generous.  So much so that a family of four can get all their groceries in that space.

We, also, wanted to the power slider door and at the time, Chevy Venture was the first and only one to have this as well.  This feature has been priceless.  Having two children I can open the door for the oldest with the remote and put the youngest in the seat behind me.  I only wish now that if I do buy this vehicle in the future again, that the driver side slider will be powered also.

The Venture we ended up purchasing is loaded with all features.  I have found especially nice the built in leveling suspension with air pump.  Many times we have heavy loads and yet the vehicle compensates perfectly.  The air pump is used all the time for auto and bike tires, balls of various kinds, and pool toys.  With the 20ft hose on it you don't have to be right there at the back of the van.

Another nice item was the front and rear audio controls where if the back row doesn't like what the front row is listening to, they can plug in the headphones and choose either cd, tape, or any radio station.  It really gives the back row something to relax to.

The negatives have been that the vehicle has needed some warranty service.  One of the first problems we had was that the power sliding door wouldn't close properly, so we had to have it adjusted about 3 different times in the first 1000 miles.  Since then, it has performed flawlessly.  We twice had leaky headlight housings that had to be replaced.  Then recently the pump and control component for the rear leveling suspension required replacement as they kept blowing fuses.

This vehicle does have good room though as well.  We took it on a family vacation this summer where our family of four drove round trip from CT to CO.  Though it was long, the trip was smooth and pleasant.  The engine gave great power and gas mileage(25MPG avg.) and the family was able to spread out even though we are a family that tends to bring everything we own.

This vehicle has carried it all.  From Christmas trees to sheetrock to lumber to bikes and on and on.  It has done it all and asking for more.  Even with the warranty repairs, I'd still give it an up recommendation.<br><br>
