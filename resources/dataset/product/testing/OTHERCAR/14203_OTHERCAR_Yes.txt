            No, the Accent is not the perfect car, at least not for everyone.  But it nearly makes the mark for me.  I've owned my 2003 GL 4 door for 1 month and 600 miles.  The more I drive it, the more I like it.

It is fun to drive, is loaded with features, and sips fuel. The car appears to be very well made; nothing squeaks, rattles, or feels cheap.

Optional on many competing brands, the equipment on this subcompact is amazing.  Auto, AC, PS, PB, PL, PW, PM, RWD, CD/radio, and more.  Note: Some of these options are part of the Prefered Package.

Before buying I considered a Cavalier/Sunbird.  What a piece of junk!

The AC is ice-cold, steering is precise, braking is very good, the audio system is impressive, the interior is up-to-date and comfortable, the driver's seat includes adjustable height, lumbar, and angle.

It comes with front passenger air bags AND front passenger side air bags.

One minor complaint.  The engine is a bit under powered for freeway use.  Although the car does cruise comfortably at 75 MPH with the overdrive engaged.  But 95% of my driving is in a small city.

I love my Accent.  And it looks like Hyundai has cleaned up its reliability / quality problems.
