            I just love my CR-V.  It may be small but it's just perfect for me and my son: I wouldn't recommend it for a family of more than three, especially if infant car seats are involved.  Can't believe all the stuff that's on it either - and I didn't add any extras!  In fact it was partly this reason that I bought this car, because I wanted things like a CD player and keyless entry without having to pay for it as 'extras'.
I love the colour too - Honda Green.
I bought the car with manual transmission and, although I don't know much about this, I would say that it is more fun to drive this way (I did try the automatic).  
My only gripe is that the engine is too small, I think that a little more 'get up and go' would have been fabulous.  Other than that, no gripes at all.
Great little car.<br><br>
