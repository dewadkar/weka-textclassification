            I've had my 2003 Dodge Durango SLT 4x4 for a full year now and am very satisfied with my decision. After an exhaustive search to find the ultimate mid-size vehicle for my new family around the $30k-$35k range, i set my sights on the Durango. Here's why:

First, it's not a sissy SUV. It is one of the only mid-sized on the market that a 30 year old can drive that will not make him look A; like my dad driving an outdated jeep cherokee or B; a spineless, mousy fella sporting pleated dockers and a wife calling the shots&#151it's just not for me. I'm not a red-neck either. I'm a fashionable city dood that's not going to give in to a weak-minded mini-van-i don't care how many wheel-drive it is. They suck and so do the people driving them. Show me a good mini-van driver.

The second reason would be for safety. I'm not talking airbags here (although another downfall is the lack of side-impact airbags). What i'm talking about is sheer size. It's called survial of the fittest  and my family and i have a better chance of living through a crash if we're in this bad boy. I wish i could afford a BMW, Audi or Volvo with all there technology and innovations-i simply can't. So, i gotta go with size. 

Aesthetically speaking, I have two points to make to whoever designed this fun-driving muscle factory (it purrs like a tom cat). The first would be to redesign the uninspiring instrument panel. What in the world were you thinking? Also, The center console has no more reason to exist than a three dollar bill. What was the point? i've tried to stash CD's, small animals and beverages in there, but it's just plain awkward. Perhaps i should stop griping and check out the 2004. 

Overall, I have had nothing but fun driving my truck. It feels like the perfect blend between a truck and a beefy car and it has some personality to boot. I think it is extremely comfortable to drive. Goof vision except for the A-pillars so you'll need to look around a bit more. The biggest kick in the in the ribs, however, is its enormous appetite for fossil fuels. 13.9 mpg in the city -ouch. 

Drive fast. Take chances.
