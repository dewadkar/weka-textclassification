            Well we never thought we would hit the days when we would need a minivan, In fact my husband said he would never have one.  Well we just had our second child, and bought a house.  Having two sedans just didn't seem to work anymore. Couldn't pick up simple furniture items or even smaller household items, and lets just say the family trips were a little cramped. The new Odyssey has made our everyday life a snap.

I asked and asked and always was offered an alternative, like a sports utility car, &quot;Not a minivan he would say&quot;.  I had to admit I hadn't seen or driven anything that was too exciting I just thought it was necessary not fun.  But we went and looked at the Odyssey and the big features that changed our mind were that this van actually had some horsepower and a good pickup. I almost forgot to mention the disappearing back seat my son thinks its magic. The automatic opening doors are a must with a toddler and a new baby.  Then all the other features just kept saying they thought of everything. From the cup holders to the sunglass holders, a built in garage door opener. I have to say the only strange thing is being in the van by myself, Its a big car and needs to be full of people or stuff, I should always be allowed in the car pool lane.  But that doesn't happen often with 2 kids and family plans.

Both my husband and I have found a great many uses and conveniences with our new van and my 4 year old finally has the car of his dreams.  Needless to say we've only had it for 6 months and gotten a great deal of use out of it. No more cramped vacations and trips, and no more calling relatives to help us pick up the bigger items.<br><br>
