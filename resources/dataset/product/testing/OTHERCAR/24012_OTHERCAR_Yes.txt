            <b>Value</b>

It's a good camera for the price that it is offered for. You may think that the price reflects the quality, but you'd be amazed at the value that comes from it. The quality of the actual hardware is decent. It looks pleasing with nothing ugly about it.

<b>Picture Quality</b>

This 2.0 megapixel camera gives decent quality pictures. It's no high quality SLR camera, but for the average Joe, it will do. I am saying this comments pertaining to the highest quality that the camera can offer. I haven't tried the lower resolutions so I can't say how bad it can get.

<b>Features</b>

This camera has few features, since it is an entry-level camera. No settings for focus other than macro and landscape. It does, however, have options for exposure control, which I find useful in situations where the camera comes out with dark or bright images. It has an internal 16MB memory, but that can quickly run out, so I suggest getting a 256 MB Smart Media Card to have plenty of space. It can record short video clips without sound, but it takes up a lot of memory.

The Digital Zoom that it has is worthless because the quality is already average and when you zoom up on it digitally, the picture gets very blurry. No optical zoom is featured on this camera.

<b>Batteries</b>

The battery life with Energizer 1250 maH rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride batteries is pretty good. I say about 100 pictures, but I haven't really taken that many shots in a short period of time and I frequently charge the batteries before I take my camera out.

<b>Misc.</b>

This camera is prone to crashing like a computer. A simple on and off is what is needed, but sometimes it gets so bad that I need to take out the batteries in order to reset it.

I've dropped it (accidently, of course) a couple times and it it still in one piece.

The speed that it takes to save to a Smart Media card is about 3 seconds without flash and 10 seconds with flash. The flash takes a while to recharge.

The manual is sufficient and does the job of explaining how to use the camera.

The shutter delay is about 1-2 seconds after pressing the button.

The flash is very bright and sometimes way too bright up close pictures. All my pictures that are up close with flash are white.

The camera comes with a handy carrying case to protect it as well, since the lens is exposed with no shutters over it.

I bought this camera, because I wanted a cheap digital camera and since I have brought products from Aiptek before I knew that it's a good value for the buck.
