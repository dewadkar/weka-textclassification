            <b>Reviewed Model:  VW Passat GLX V6</b>

I was introduced to the VW Passat when my brother bought one and let me take his for test drive.  Having not seen one before, I immediately fell in love with its handsome, simple styling and luxurious appointments, and I was absolutely floored by its sports car handling.

The Passat has ample power, especially at highway speeds, to accelerate smoothly and surely.  Its V6 is quite torquey and responsive.  But what really knocks me out about the car is its handling.  This baby is an absolute hoot to drive!  

The Passat will handle hairpin turns and wet weather with glee, stubbornly sticking to the road and giving the driver complete confidence in its ability.  Neither the Toyota Camry or a Ford Taurus, which are much more softly sprung, can hope to attempt the feats the Passat is capable of handling.  However, the Passat will transmit a bit more bumps to the passenger because of its stiffer suspension.  That is the trade-off for such wonderful handling.

The tip-tronic automatic transmission, which also lets you shift manually, and the V-6 are a winning and smooth powertrain.  The leather seats are very comfortable and highly adjustable.  The seating position is excellent, and there is enough passenger room to fit four rather large adults comfortably, even in the back seat.  In addition, the trunk is pretty large too.  The standard sound system is excellent and it also comes with amenities such as a sunroof, heated side view mirrors, lighted front vanity mirrors and an excellent cup holder.  The ride is quiet and firm, inspiring confidence in the vehicle's competence. 

People who like to drive and put a premium on performance and handling should consider trying out this vehicle if they are considering a Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable, Honda Accord or Nissan Maxima.  People who prefer more softly sprung and cushiony rides should be wary of the Passat and test drive it thoroughly before making a buying decision.

If you like to drive and have a little fun while doing so, consider the VW Passat.
