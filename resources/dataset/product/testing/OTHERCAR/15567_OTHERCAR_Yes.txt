            The Astro van has earned a good reputation as a reliable mini-van.  It's better for towing, and has more room than the Chrysler mini-vans.  I chose the 2 wheel drive version for several reasons. It is far more economical than the 4 wd version in regards to gas mileage.  Expect about 17 mpg hwy with the AWD version, and up to 24 mpg with the 2 wd version.  It's got plenty of power, and seating up to 8.  I believe the 2 wd version is more reliable than the AWD counterpart, based upon reports I've read.  It only makes sense...there are less moving parts.

My friend, who owns a 1999 AWD Astro, reports after driving mine that it handles much better on the road.

I've had a few problems, though.  It is a rough-riding van, and seems to feel every bump in the road, especially on gravel roads.  With that roughness, comes plenty of squeaks and rattles.  On a smooth paved road, however, it's very quiet and smooth.<br><br>
