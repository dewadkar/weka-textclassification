            The 2002 Nissan Pathfinder is absolutely an SUV you can buy with confidence.  I will give you the low down on the car without all the technical specifications which you can simply get from Nissan's website.  But if that is your thing then I recommend Dhano923's review.

I've owned my 2002 Pathfinder LE for about 8 months now and I am totally satisfied and proud to own it.  Before buying it I was looking at the Audi A4, BMW 325, Toyota 4Runner and Toyota Camry.  I was looking for a luxury vehicle with four doors that I would be happy to own for the next 10 years, so price was not my number one criteria.  The last dealership I went to was Nissan and as soon as I got into the Pathfinder I was sold.  The other cars I mentioned above only had a handful of the features I wanted but the Pathfinder had all of them in a single vehicle.

Since I bought a fully loaded LE with the leather package it was easy to have everything that I wanted: 3.5L 240 hp V6 engine, 4-wheel drive, heated and 8-way power driver seat, seat memory, sunroof, Homelink universal transceiver, remote keyless entry, and 4 airbags.  Not to mention a bunch of extras that I'm glad to have: roof rack, class III tow hitch, running boards, reclining rear seats with head rests, Bose 6 speaker audio with in-dash cd changer, radio controls on steering wheel, automatic On/Off headlamps, automatic climate control, uni-body construction, ABS, Limited Slip Differential, 17" wheels, timing chain (not belt), fog lights, 3 power outlets, and even heated side mirrors.  It is obvious to see that the Pathfinder does not lack features.

Now I'll talk about some of the positive and negative surprises of the Pathfinder.  Did you know that if you hold down the unlock button on your key fob it will remotely open the diver and front passenger windows?  You can also close the windows remotely by holding down the lock button on your key fob.  You can also open and close the windows by holding the lock or unlock positions with your key in the driver side keyhole.  There is also a hidden compartment under the carpet of the cargo area.  Great place to put jumper cables, tow hitch accessories and cargo net in.  If one of your doors is not completely closed (ie. rear hatch door) your lights will not blink twice when setting your alarm telling you that a door is ajar.  It also has a "one-touch" open and close sunroof.  I hated that I had to hold down the open button for the sunroof on my old Toyota Camry.

Now on to the negative surprises.  The lid to the rear passenger-side compartment rattles because all that is holding it in place are two plastic knobs.  The vanity lights for the visors are very dim and orange in color.  The rear seats are very shallow so can get uncomfortable for tall people, especially on long trips.

Overall the great features and design of the Pathfinder greatly out-weighs its few flaws.  When moving, I attached a packed Uhaul trailer to my tow-hitch and had power to spare even on the hills of San Francisco.  It also has an exterior light connection so that you can hook up the Uhaul's rear trailer lights to your car.  Furthermore, the roof rack is high enough so that when I put on my snowboard rack the bindings don't hit the top of the roof.

The Pathfinder is definitely a no-compromise vehicle that anyone would be proud to own.  I wished I could only add the Mobile Entertainment System but having the sunroof limits this option.  If you're thinking about buying the Pathfinder...JUST DO IT!

By the way...I paid $35,000 for this SUV but that's only because I added the extended warranty.  Though I don't expect anything to go wrong with it, since Nissan has a great reputation for reliability, my Pathfinder has so many electrical features and with the 4-wheel drive transmission it helped to have peace of mind.  The bottom-line for the Pathfinder LE...it's worth every penny.
