            This is the first car I have bought in almost ten years.  I had owned a Honda and was in the market for a two door sports car in the low $20,000's.  The other models I looked at were the Acura Legend, Honda Prelude, Mitsubishi Eclipse, and Chrysler Sebring.

I chose the Toyota for many reasons.

The first was the interior comfort.  They have done a great job with the appointments and the layout of the console.  One thing that Toyota offered over anyone else is a stereo with tape and CD in the same unit.  Number one: saves space. Number two: didn't have to pay an extra $300 for a tape player.  There is a mini glove box above the stereo that comes in handy for coins, sunglasses, etc. - my favorite feature.  I got the leather, and really appreciate it.  The seats are very comfortable, even for long trips.  The back seat is small, but realistic for having passengers.  The Honda definitely has no room for more than two people!  Also the hatchback is nice - I was able to put a computer box in the trunk with no problem.  Especially important: Golf clubs fit without putting the seat down.

The exterior styling is a real head-turner.  The air scoop on the hood and the bulging headlamps get a lot of positive comments.  The head lights are really something else! The lights are aligned so that that in normal mode, they do not shine above the trunk of the car in front of you, but the ground and surrounding road is very visible.

The handling is exceptional.  It took some getting used to a car not leaning when going through a turn.  I can hold turns much better than I expected to.  Cornering is GREAT!  The ABS brakes came in handy during a recent snow/ice storm when someone pulled out in front of me.  The car is quick too.  Since I live in a big city, I chose the automatic with much regret, but I have been pleasantly surprised.  180 hp in a car that has a light chasis is plenty to move in and around traffic with confidence.

The only negative thing I can say is that on especially cold mornings, the heat takes a while to get going.  Balancing the temperature is a little difficult, since the cabin is relatively small.

Overall, I am very pleased, and have already decided to make my next car a Toyota.<br><br>
