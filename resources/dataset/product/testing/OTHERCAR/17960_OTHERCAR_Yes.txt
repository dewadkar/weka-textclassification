            I love my  <b>1998 Wrangler</b>.  The ride is incredibly comfortable, considering that it's an off-road vehicle.  OK, so I got the Sport model with 6 cylinders, but hey, it's a stick (5-speed) with <b>4-wheel drive</b>, and it can go off-road.  And it has a purple pinstripe!  The 4-wheel drive is important because I live in the mountains.  Also, it turns so tightly that I can park it just about anywhere.  I have a choice, since I also have a Toyota Tacoma pickup truck with 4-wheel drive, but I prefer the Jeep when it snows.  I feel <i>safer and more in control</i> of my vehicle.  

This is a real Jeep, not an urban cowboy SUV.  It's small, but it does have a back seat that can hold two comfortably or three packed in tightly.  You can get leather seats, as I did, or vinyl if you prefer.  The driver's seat and the front passenger seat are both comfy, roomy buckets with plenty of foot room.  When my adult son goes off-road, he straps the dirt bike onto the back of the Jeep, where the <i>spare tire</i> is.  That spare tire saved me the other day, when I backed into a post in my driveway.  It didn't hurt anything because the spare tire just bounced off of the post.  Cool!

The center console has plenty of room for your CDs and other stuff, and you can <b>lock</b> it.  I have one of those radios that you can take out the face to avoid theft, so it's really handy to be able to lock it up in the console.  Also, we keep a little bit of cash in there for emergencies.  

The <b>fuses</b> are easy to find and replace:  they're all in the glove box.  Just slide the nylon web out of the slot, and you can take the glove box off completely, and there are your fuses, right in front of your face.  Unlike some vehicles, you don't have to be a contortionist to get to them.  The glove box also <b>locks</b>, making your important papers safe. 

OK, the <i>gas mileage</i> is acceptable but not great -- less than 20 miles a gallon, depending on where I drive it, uphill being the worst, of course, and I do live on a mountain.  This is a real Jeep, not an economy car, but it's still <i>better</i> than any SUV or pickup truck.  It rattles a little, and the zippered windows can be a hassle, but that's what you get with a rag-top Jeep.  If you want luxury, get a luxury car.  Or a gas-hogging SUV.  I recommend the Jeep Grand Cherokee for luxury, but the gas mileage sucks and it lacks road feel.  In fact, my Wrangler feels much more <i>solid</i> and <i>handles the road better</i> than the Cherokee. 


<b>Keys</b>

One key works both the doors and the ignition, as well a the console and glove box.  The key is double-sided, with a rubber grip.  It can't be pulled out of the ignition by accident because you have to depress the release lever, with the key in the "lock" position, to take it out.  The ignition lock has five positions:  "acc" for accessories, "lock" for locking the steering wheel, "off", "on", and "start" for starting the engine.  To get replacement keys, just take the registration or any other paper with the VIN number to a Jeep dealer.  They can make you a new key in about 10 minutes for about 10 bucks.

<b>NOTE:</b>  The steering wheel locks if you turn the wheel about 1/2 turn with the ignition key removed or in the "lock" position.  To unlock the steering wheel, tun the ignition key to the "on" position and gently turn the steering wheel in either direction.

<b>Steering Wheel</b>

The Jeep has power steering, a locking steering wheel (see NOTE above), and an airbag in the steering wheel.  The steering wheel is nice and big, making it easy to place your hands in the recommended "9 o'clock and 3 o'clock" positions, but not so big that you can't sit comfortably in the driver's seat.  You can tilt it to a comfortable position.  The lever that controls your windshield wipers is right there by your right hand, so you can set the wipers without letting go of the wheel.  This gives you extra safety and control.  The wipers have an intermittent setting, and you can turn the knob on the end of the lever to make them go faster or slower.

<b>Seat Belts and Air Bags</b>

The front bucket seats have seat belts with shoulder straps, and they're relatively comfortable.  I don't seem to have that "special" problem of rubbing that women tend to get with shoulder straps.  The back seat has three seat belts, two with shoulder straps and the center one without.  There's an airbag in the steering wheel, and another one in the dash on the front passenger side.

<b>Optional Trunk</b>

You can get an add-on trunk, to provide extra security for items stored behind the back seat.  This trunk is easy to remove by simply undoing four hex bolts.  The tailgate (where the spare tire is mounted) opens outward and toward the passenger side, like a door, giving you easy access the stuff behind the back seat.

<b>Brakes</b>
The brake pedal feels firm.  It has ABS, so you can stop smoothly and straight, without any wiggling.  The Jeep stops quickly, too, although I can't give you the numbers.   The hand brake is a nice, straight lever between the shifter and the console, with a release button on the end of the handle.  It's easy to set, and easy to release, and it holds the Jeep pretty well, even on a hill.  Just the same, please leave it in first gear or reverse when you park on a hill, for extra safety.

<b>Clutch, Shifter</b>

The clutch pedal is easy to press down, and it has plenty of "feel".  One thing that I hate on some cars is when the clutch pedal feels dead, and then all of  sudden it catches and you go jerking and jumping, especially if you're in reverse.  That <i>never</i> happens with my Jeep.  I can tell when it's going to catch, and there's time and room to let it out smoothly.
The shift lever has a medium throw.  In other words, you don't have to move it a long distance, but you do have to move it a few inches, say, between first and second.  You can move it sideways to make sure that you really are in neutral.  It tends to "help" by guiding you when you're shifting from second to third, and from third to fourth.  Reverse is all the way to the right and then down (toward the seats), so you aren't likely to get reverse when you're looking for third or fifth.  Oh, yeah, fifth gear is overdrive, for freeway driving.  It saves on gas.

<b>Final Thoughts</b>

The heater works really great.  It has a number of settings, including one that allows you to throw heat onto your feet, while there's also some going up to defrost the windshield.  I've found that setting to be really handy in the winter.  I don't have air conditioning, but you can get it as an option.  Did I mention fog lights?  They're wonderful!  They really do help me to see where I'm going when it's foggy.

Even though I'm a small woman and pushing 50, my little Wrangler is easy to drive.  And it's fun, too!  The <b>clutch</b> is easy to manage, and this little Jeep is responsive.  It almost seems to read my mind.  It has good pick up, and you won't find yourself left in the dust unless you're up against a muscle car with a driver who seriously wants to race.  Now, this Jeep was not designed to barrel down the freeway at 70 mph for an hour or two to commute to work.  That's what my 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee is for.  Yup, I'm sold on Jeep.  My Wrangler is 7 years old, with about 70 thousand miles, and it still runs great.  It almost never needs any kind of repairs.  It just goes and goes, and it's a <b>joy to drive</b>.  Besides, perfect strangers compliment me on my cool Jeep whenever I park it and get out.  I try to avoid parking and getting out, since I'd rather be driving it. 

The only problem that I've had is that my fat dog (100-pound Rottweiler) has a hard time climbing up into the back seat.     But he loves my Jeep, too, so with a little boost from me, he manages to get up and in there.
