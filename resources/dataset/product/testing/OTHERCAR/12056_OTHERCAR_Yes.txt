            If you drive because you love cars and attention, sell whatever you own and by a Prowler!  This car is definitely the most fun you can have with your close on.  Nothing else looks or feels like this car.  With improved performance, the '99s are superior to the '97s and offer a selection of hot-rodding colors.  I own a 1999 black Prowler and it is be best car buying decision that I have ever made.  I grew up in the automobile business and owned two GM/Toyota dealerships until the mid-80s.  Since leaving the business, I have been driving Pontiacs looking for &quot;driving excitement&quot;.  This car IS excitement.  Granted, this car is not for everyone, only people with a love and passion for cars.  The car has no real usable trunk, no spare tire, and smallish doors.  Once inside, the car swallows you in comfort and style that cannot be matched by any other vehicle.  The performance is adequate (0-60 in 5.7 sec), handling and responsiveness are very good.  This car was built for cruisin'!  If you are looking for untouchabe style, good performance, excellent handling and a freeway full of bug-eyed commuters, this is definitely the car for you.
I'm saving my money to buy my second Prowler to save as a collector's piece.<br><br>
