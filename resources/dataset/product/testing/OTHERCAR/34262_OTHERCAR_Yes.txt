            I promised my wife the next car would be her's.  Her priority's were.  Brand name, Automatic Transmission, Navigation system, comfort and wanted to feel special.

So off we went in Early December 2001 to check out the BMW three series, Lexus IS300, Merc C240 and Jaguar.  Somehow we missed Audi, not sure why.

The BMW is a nice car, but everyone has em, and remember she want's an automatic.  So I steered her away.  The C240, again a nice car but I think they are losing it a little on styling.  Sometimes I have to look twice to make sure it's a merc.  The interior did nothing for me and they were not able to show us one with a nav system.  The dealer pointed to where it would go and it seemed too small. On to Lexus.  My wife didn't like the styling much and I have to agree.  Again it's a more sport orientated car too.

So then we looked at the Jag.  I test drove the stick shift and loved it.  We both test drive the auto and I hated it! :)  But she liked it.  The cabin is soooo nice.  It just fits.  You know when you get in a car, and it feels good?  Case closed.

So I ended up working the numbers with the dealership behind my wife's back.  He had one exactly as we wanted.  2.5 motor, auto trans, nav system, upgraded stereo, X1 premium pack.

Now everyone says this bumps the price up.  But it actually works out about the same as the BMW and the Merc once you add the bits, in fact it comes out slightly cheaper.

So I surprised her with it for Christmas.

Now, six months later, we both really like it.  It's not without it's faults.  In fact it's been back to the dealer 4 times to date for minor problems.  But all seems to be worked out well, and hey, they gave me a courtesy S Type to drive for the day.

First, whats not to like.

1. The center arm rest.  It feels flimsy and low quality.
2. Only one cup holder, and a tiny one at that.
3. One accessory socket, I can't use a double plug because it hit's the gear shift.  So we have to plug our phones and radar detector into one on a wire dangling in the passenger footwell.  I suppose we could get the phone system fitted...
4. No memory option!!!! Come on Jaguar..
5. Power, sure there's enough but you don't feel it until you look at the speedo.  I think it's the auto box and the AWD that conspires.  This car is NOT quick off the mark.  Pity, the Stick shift was fun, but that wasn't my call.
6. There is an annoying rattle somewhere in the drivers side.  The dealer and I are still trying to track it down.

Ok, what do I like.

1. Nav system.  Large touch screen, intuitive, can be switched to talk in British English! lol
2. Dash, green dials are elegant and the shape of the dash integrates with the rest of the design.  Leather everywhere as std.  Take a deep breath, ahh the aroma!
3. Silky smooth engine.  Gosh officer I didn't feel like I was doing 90, are you sure?  
4. AWD, wow, now we can take it skiing, but it still feels more like a RWD!
5. Drop down rear seats, and huge trunk, it even fit may surfboard in at a push.
6. Solid feel, nice clunk as you close the door.
7. Relaxing for long drives.  LA to Phoenix and back, no sweat.  Comfortable seats, I am medium build and 5'8, I find I slop around in some of the other cars.
8. Ownership experience.  My previous car was a 98 Corvette, a more expensive car.  The Chevy dealer treated me with indifference.  Not so Jaguar, in fact I can't speak highly enough of them, I always get the car back washed and clean.
9. Looks, not that many people have them, and people always think it cost more than it did! :)

Ok, to conclude.  If you want a sports coupe, make sure you go for the sports pack and stick shift.  The 3.0 is very nice.  The Auto turns this cat into a more stately car, but she will still get up and go when needed (with a very nice engine/exhaust note) It has a nice balance of luxury, performance and class that I think you will be hard pressed to find in the other cars without spending on the options.  Call me crazy, but when I buy a luxury car, I expect it to feel luxurious, which the Jag does.  It fits our needs perfectly, and is a hoot to drive if pushed (much to my wife's disgust! lol)
