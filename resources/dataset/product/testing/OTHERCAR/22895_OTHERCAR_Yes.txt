            I love this car.  I bought this 14 Year-old, semi-beat-up, drive me till it die vehicle as  a cheap mean of transporting myself off base. I paid $2000 a year ago when it had 140K mi =) and the only thing I had to replace was the starter...and when I yanked it, it was the original!!!  If you could find a better car for similar price with the 240sx power, maneveurability, reliability and overall driver experience, pinch yourself hard cause you're obviously dreaming.

First off, the Nissan USA's KA24 powerplant is peppy but pales to Nissan Japan's SR20DET. (I was lucky enough to try one out, more on that later)  The Chassis, tranny and suspension can handle over 250HP easy but is pulling half of that (140-150 depending on year)  

But enough griping. This car drives and handles like a much more expensive sports car. (feels like a porche 944, only it's not)  I'm 160lbs and 5'9"; the seats fit me like a glove.  The semi buckets seats are more comfortable than those found on much newer cars and have just the right amount of support as you whip youself into a 35mph/90 degree turn while downshifting into second and jerk yourself foward if you so much as ease off that clutch.  The shiftknob is impossible to change out but overall, the shifter is placed almost so perfectly that you feel as if the tranny is an extention of your arm.  The body of the vehicle leans alittle more than I expected from a low coupe but I am assured that this thing will not tip over, no matter how hard you try. =) My old 240sx is still pretty quick off the line but face it, it's an N/A 4 banger and was never intended to compete with 'stangs or Camaros. 

I am however, extremely dissapointed that it did not slaughter competition during it's day. Ford Probes?? Even the my friend's 94 GT with a manual tranny no less...have problems passing me...and they totally stole their styling cues from the hatchback 240's.  Not entirely Ford's fault though, Mazda MX6's and their shared engines are to blame.  Celicas??  Sure it's faster but it drives like a corolla!  Preludes??  They've never been that much better than an Accord coupe and were absolutely worthless until '92.  The only real competition in terms of handling/speed/value were Corrados, Jetta/Golf TDI's, MR2's and MX5's.....oh wait, they have no head room whatsoever and VW's weren't as affordable.  If only Nissan USA had been able to put SR20det's........

Speaking of which; SR20DET powered Silvias/180sx/Sileighties, etc as known in Japan, 200sx in Canadia and Australia)  are the best boy racer cars in the world. 2.0L turbocharged 200hp mini beast, bringing the 240's 0-60mph to low 6's.  I was lucky enough to drive one back home in Brooklyn NY. 
It took Lan Evo's 3 generations to produce those numbers.  

Even the big bogs are giving up the "no replacement for displacement" Philosophy.  Their "Civic/Integra/RSX killers", the Dodge Neon SRT 4 houses a 2.4l engine pumping 230 horses.  Chevy's proposed supercharged Caviliers (snicker) and the 80 different "performance" versions of Ford Focus.  I think Ford still haven't figure out which version sucks the most.
Hmm... turbocharged engines on a lightweight body with knife-fighter manevuerability....wish someone had thought of that...oh wait, Nissan did. 14 years ago!!

I'm Glad that Nissan dusted off the drawing boards for the Z lovers and but stabbed everyone in the back when they killed the Japanese Godzilla flagship...The Skyline.... what the heck are those Frenchies doing?? The world needs and S16, a new Silvia, to complement the Z classics.  The S-line up is just as great and it's a simple idea that works.  Nissan, show the world what a real sports coupe is suppose to be like!

PS I recent purhased a '01 Honda Civic because I need to haul people and equipment.  I miss my 240 whenever I drive the Civic.  I'm still getting offers for my 240 to which I politely decline.  Hopefully by Christmas of next year, I can revive my special 240 as a Silvia.
