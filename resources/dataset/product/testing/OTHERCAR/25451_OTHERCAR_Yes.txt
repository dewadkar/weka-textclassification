            The joke where I work is that everyone owns a Saturn.  And it's almost true.  Of the 10 people in my immediate department, <i>six</i> of them own Saturn SLs!  That's a bit wacky, but it also means I've had the chance to ride in and drive them quite a bit.

The Saturn seems to be a great car.  It's ride is smooth and quiet for a small car like this.  The back seat is roomy enough for my six foot frame, and that's saying a lot compared with other cars I've ridden in.  In particular, it's amazing how much more room the SL has than the SC in the back seat!  The SL2 has the extra power you need to accelerate safely.  The SL1 seems a bit underpowered.  Steering is smooth and easy, and the brakes work very well.

When my wife was shopping for cars, she seriously considered a Saturn.  I believe it's the best deal for a car this size, but we happened on a special and bought a more expensive car for the same price.  Otherwise we were going to get the Saturn.  It's a good deal, and the salespeople are friendly and go out of their way to answer your questions and help you decide what's best for you.

The biggest drawback to this car is what I mentioned above: so many people own one just like it.  If you read my review of the Honda Civic, you know I don't much like cars that blend in so much.  But if you're looking for a good value, this is the way to go.<br><br>
