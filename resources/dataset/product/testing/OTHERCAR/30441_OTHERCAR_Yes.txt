            It feels strange as this is the first time I am writing here about a subject or a product that doesn't interest me in the slightest.  No, I don't feel passionate about the Corolla.  Its just a car.  Sit in it and turn the key, and it will take you from A to B.  There is nothing exciting or negative about it.  Its sort of like a tool that you buy because you need to; its a car for the person who needs a car.  Nobody will drop a 5.0 under its hood and take it down to the local track for quick laps.

<b>Exterior</b>
Its shape is quite classic.  Sort of like an 80's car except that all of its angles have gone through a smoothener.  Its hard to find a sharp or an agressive edge in the body of this car.  Its all too plain, but that is not to say that it looks ugly -- it looks like a car.  Old Corolla's used to be smaller, more like on the 'economical' edge.  That is no longer the case -- the new Corolla is a mid-sized family sedan.


<b>Interior</b>
There are two seats in the front: one for the passenger, the other for the driver. *cough*  Ok.  I can't afford to sound so lame even if this car is so unoriginal.  I don't like cloth seats, and I really didn't like the 'hard' seats of the Corolla.  Its not in anyway uncomfortable, but my buttocks enjoy sitting in my 'stang, even though its a sports car.  The radio buttons have been inclined slightly towards the driver, giving easy access while cruising.  This is something I would definitely appreciate, as the Mustang buttons are flat and you need to extend your arm to reach them.

<b>Engine</b>
Corolla sports an inline 4-cylinder engine that uses variable valve-timing technology.  What does this mean to you?  Less fuel consumption, for starters.  Second, it means that it can contribute to preventing acid rain from ruining your paint job.  To me it means a weak, unexciting 120HP output.  You aren't going to have trouble doing gentle passes in the highway, but don't test your luck as a drag racer.  

This is a decent car, and rumored to be quite reliable.  As a regular tool, it serves its purpose well enough.  Corolla is the perfect car for someone who needs just that.  If you want an exciting head turner, this is not the car to get.
