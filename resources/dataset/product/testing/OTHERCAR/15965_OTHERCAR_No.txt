            There are a number of versions of the E-Class from Mercedes-Benz. These versions basically correspond to the size of the engine. Currently there are three versions available in the E-Class, the 320, the 430, and the E-55 AMG. The 320 is equipped with a six-cylinder 3.2-liter engine and is considered the base model. The next step up is a 4.3-liter V8 with added upgrades. The top model is a 5.5 hand assembled 349 horse powered V8. 

Unfortunately all of these models share the same core body with an upgrade here and there. I considered the body style to be old and tired. The car is shaped more like a tank than aerodynamically inspired. Also the interior is more of the same blah. It has an unimpressive counsel with oddly arranged wood trim. A few years ago I would have given glowing reviews to this car but considering the new body designs in the S-Class and the C-Class it is time for MB to give the E-Class a new look.

In addition to the old look of the car it is very expensive. The base price for the 320 is about $47K. Unfortunately this price does not include basic luxury features like a sunroof or rear shade. New car buys could easily add another $6K in basic luxury features. A fully equipped and decked out version will cost at least $61K or $13K over the base price. Also please remember that this is for the 320 version. The 430 starts at $53K.
