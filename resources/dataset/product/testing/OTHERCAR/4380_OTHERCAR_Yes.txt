            Anyone who was driven a BMW knows what it stands for: quality, dependability, safety, and good looks.  If you are thinking of getting a BMW 3 series, you should buy it.  There are so many standard features are optional on most other cars.  I bought my first BMW last year and now I hesitate to drive any other car.  The ride is so smooth and effortless.  The soft leather seats provide the perfect support for many a long drive.  The fuel economy is also good.  Expect to get 20-25 MPG in the city and 25-28 on the highways.  The security that is standard on BMWs also adds another level of confidence.  Each key has its own microchip embedded within it.  Only the right &quot;combination&quot; will allow ignition. Would-be car thieves can expect the engine to do nothing.  BMW calls this &quot;coded driveaway protection.&quot;  Its a feature not many cars carry.  The sound system is also excellent.  The optional Harman Kardon system provides a sound that is to be heard to be believed.  BMWs are very smart cars.  Upon ignition, an oil gauge will tell you exactly when you should change your oil.  I thought that no matter what, I should get the oil changed every 3000 miles on ordinary cars.  Well, this is no ordinary car.  The computer inside the BMW will tell you exactly when to get the oil changed, and sometimes, it can go many miles beyond that.  The only bad thing about BMW is that there are only a few BMW service centers in each city.  I have 2 centers where I live, and they are each about a 25 minute drive away.  This can be a hassle when getting the oil changed.  But since the BMW is a car of privilege, this is to be expected.  If you can afford a BMW, go out and get it, you won't be disappointed.  Quality, dependability, safety, and good looks.  All these points can be attributed to any BMW.     <br><br>
