            If you thought a Polaroid was fun and easy, the FD100 puts you into the digital age effortlessly.  Most people can use this camera right out of the box.   Because it is so basically intuitive, with menus on the BIG LCD display, you get a feeling right away that this is gonna be EASY.   My very first pic was PERFECT, auto-flash and auto-focus triggered automatically.  And, I love the ZOOM feature, which allows you to frame a shot on the large LCD screen in a WYSIWYG preview.

The camera created a near riot at my office Christmas party when I had shots up on all the computers in the place within minutes thanks to the easy floppy-disk transfer--no cables or plugs needed.   Everybody wanted a pic on the computer and thought it was way cool.  Pics are in .jpg format so can be uploaded to either PC or Mac computers.

Although the FD100 is mostly an automatic camera, it DOES allow certain manual adjustments for specialized applications such as up-close focus and text mode.  Shots can be also be framed in 3:2 format for prints or set to Email mode.  USB cable is suppled and a memory-stick can be used instead of floppy disks for more storage if you want.   A range of lenses and accessories is available too.   

Though it takes high quality images, the floppy disk media is this camera's claim to fame which trades-off in a larger body to allow for the drive.  But hey, floppies are super-cheap and easy to use, right?  

This is the funnest and easiest to use quality camera I've ever owned.   Just LOVE it.
