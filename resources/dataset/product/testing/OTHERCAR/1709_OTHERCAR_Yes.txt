            I purchased my CR-V on Oct. 13, 1997 and now have 106,678 miles on it. I have had no problems just normal service. I use it for work. I pull a small trailer with a ATV which weighs about 950 lbs. about 20% of the time. My gas milage is 23 MPG. When you consider driving on dirt roads and across fields, I think it's pretty good. 

It has lot's of working room inside and more that my Ford Exp. in the work area up front. It could use more power but it's not a major problem.

The only problem I have is my wife won't to use it all the time. 

I will but another one when the new models come out in 2001 or 2002.
