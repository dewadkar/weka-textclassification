            You can tell quality the moment you sit in this luxurious car. The entire interior was recently re-designed by Jaguar to place the cruise controls, fog light controls, and those that used to be obstructed into better positions. I'm very impressed with the new V-8 in these sedans. The inline 6 was not at all bad, but you sure can tell a difference when you punch that pedal to the floor and watch the tachometer jump. The transmission shifting is barely noticeable, and the ride is so smooth that it erases minor bumps completely on most road surfaces. 

As far as the interior goes, the leather is finely stitched and very comfortable. The XJ8L is actually a longer wheelbase, and allows to comfortably seat 5 people all over 6 feet tall with no problem. In the front passenger seat, I can FULLY extend my legs out and not have them hit anything at all. It's nice when you want to stretch out and lay back. The heated seats add to the winter comforts, and the rear vents exist, but don't really have too much force. I have never seen a car yet that has decent rear vents for passengers yet. For your ears, the Alpine package will get your attention. This is an 9 speaker set (counting the built-in subwoofer in the rear window area) that will surely not disappoint you. The sound is rich and clear, and the speaker positions are well hidden but effective. The GPS system is built into the sound system as well, and will automatically lower the music volume to alert you of upcoming turns. ("Left turn ahead-- 400 feet") The GPS itself is part of the radio/CD area, and is a smaller screen than I expected. However, you really don't need to study the screen because it vocalizes important turns and such. 

The exterior is basically the same as previous years. Very little changed since my 1998 XJ6L. One improvement I found was the rocker panels on the far bottom sides... they are tough and textured. This sounds strange for a car with such fine lines, but I believe their intention was to eliminate the ugliness of paint chipping from small stones hitting the rocker area while driving. 

Overall, I'm extremely pleased with all aspects of the car except the traction control. For some reason it doesn't seem as robust as it was in the 98 sedan. Then again, our winter was more robust than usual, so maybe I'm being to difficult on it. I have to admit is was far better than having none at all, and it kept me on the road while others were off. 

Go for a test drive... put it in sport mode transmission switching, use the manual transmission position on the J-gate, and floor it. Enjoy.
