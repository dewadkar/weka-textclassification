            We bought a Beetle because of its looks--plain and simple.  After the first test drive, though, I was dismayed by the relative lack of interior space.  In my native Europe, cars this size usually offer much more cabin and trunk room--witness the VW Golf or the Renault Mï¿½gane.  Four months and 5000 miles later, the car has grown on me.  True, the trunk will not swallow more than three medium-size soft bags, and transporting even a single golf bag requires folding the rear seat.  True also, the car is more sensitive than average to crosswinds, although it never feels unsafe.  But these relatively minor shortcomings are more than offset by a wealth of qualities.

With the optional 205/55-16 tires, the car feels very well balanced and stable on the road, with a taut yet well-sprung ride--not surprising since the Bug's underpinnings are essentially similar to those of the 180-hp Audi TT.  During a spirited drive down the Pacific Coast Highway from San Francisco to Los Angeles, I also had an opportunity to appreciate the brakes--plenty of stopping power with minimum fade from the all-disc setup.  Acceleration is OK with the 5-speed manual, although 115 hp is just average for the Bug's 2700 pounds.  In fact, VW used the old trick of shortening the gear ratios, which results in more engine noise than necessary at freeway speeds (3800 rpm at 75 mph in fifth gear!)  Fuel economy remains decent, though, with observed 22 mpg city and 26-27 mpg freeway.

The front seats are excellent and make 10-hour drives possible with no back pains.  Steering feel, gearshift, clutch takeup, heating and A/C are up to par for a late 1990s European design, i.e., beyond reproach.  The car's big turning radius is something of a disappointment, and the side mirrors deliberately favor form over function--looking twice before changing lanes is a must.  Finally, the trunk's minuscule size is somewhat offset by the practicality of the hatchback form factor: I was able to fit a 112-inch board inside the car and still close the hatch.  And, of course, the looks and the interior styling are to die for.

In summary, the New Beetle is a perfect car for a couple with no kids, who can enjoy the car's cool looks and ignore the lack of interior space.  If you can pony up the extra $3000, though, go for the 150-hp turbo--I took a test drive and it's an absolute blast!<br><br>
