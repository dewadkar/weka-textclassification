            This is my 5th new Toyota I've purchased.  I've owned a '71 Celica, '77 Celica, '84 Camry, '90 Camry and this '98 Camry.  I've never had any problems with the first Toyota's and that's why I kept buying Toyotas.  I sold all the previous cars with 120,000+ miles on them and the 2nd owners got lots of service from them.  Toyota built a reputation for quality and attention to details, which I think they are now losing.  I've strongly recommended all past Toyotas to many people.  Many of those people bought Toyotas.  Now to my '98 Camry.

     The '98 Camry LE V6 does NOT have the attention to detail and design that Toyota used to have.  The more I drive this car, the more I dislike it. (Just the opposite of my earlier Toyotas).  This car has LOTS of blind spots, which are just plain dangerous.  I'm still not comfortable with them after driving the car 2 years.  Suspension is too mushy and leans too much in turns.  The seat comfort is just OK;  earlier models had GREAT seat comfort. 

 Body hardware such as door handles seems flimsy.  Radio controls, wiper controls, etc., are also flimsy by previous Toyota standards.  I used to laugh in the past when friends bought American built cars and then complained about all the problems they had with their &quot;new&quot; cars.  I haven't had any problems in two years that needed a trip to the dealer, BUT, the components don't have the quality feel their cars had in the past.  I just feel that Toyota is getting too much American design and quality control (or lack thereof) and losing grasp of their well-built reputation.  

I would NOT recommend this car.  In fact, if I wouldn't lose $5-6,000 in depreciation costs, I'd sell the car now and probably buy an American built. Volkswagon has some great cars NOW which are exciting to drive and have some style for the money.  I bought this car based on my past good experiences with Toyotas which was deserved then.  That's changed. The Americans over the past few years have really designed and built some great cars.  It only took them 15 years to learn the hard way from the Japanese, but I would now buy American because of some of their great designs and big strides in quality.  Sorry Toyota, but you've lost a very loyal fan.  Get back to basics and what made you successful years ago.  

It's now Nov 2000, 11 months since I first wrote this review.  My negative opinion on this car hasn't changed.  Toyota has lost touch with what made it such a great automobile.  I'm reading here where a lot of people have rave reviews for this car.  Maybe I was just spoiled by their exceptional quality with my other four Toyotas, but I think there are better cars out there in the market today.   <br><br>
