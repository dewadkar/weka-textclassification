            We recently purchased a digital camera for our Marketing department at the credit union. We looked at several alternatives such as the Sony Mavica FD-75, Kodak DC3400 but ultimately purchased the Canon PowerShot S10. It has many desirable features and a reasonable cost. 

<b>Price</b>
The price of digital cameras has fallen quite a bit recently and the PowerShot is no exception. Its suggested retail price is $299.99. We paid slightly more, but that's what happens when you're rushed into a purchase. Shop around and you can find it for a bit less.

<b>Key Features</b>
Canon bills this camera as the "World's smallest and lightest 2.1 mega-pixel camera with 2X zoom lens." At only 9 oz. (without the battery pack), it��s a very lightweight camera; the battery pack doesn't add that much weight. It has a full color LCD screen for a viewfinder and a replay device. As with almost any good digital camera, you can delete a bad picture instantly. The 2x zoom lens is another great feature, enabling the user to get close-up shots they would have otherwise missed.  This is great for candid shots as you can get a much closer picture without the need for closeness.
	
Canon hypes several features as "key selling points": this model is good with Type I or type II flash cards. While this wasn't a major point in our purchasing decision, it's a nice feature to have. We did like the USB compatibility and the high-speed transfer of data. We can easily download the pictures onto a computer without the additional expense of a flash memory card reader.  

Some additional features are the eight exposure modes: Auto, Manual, Flash, Self-Timer, Continuous, Stitch Assist and Image. and the three JPEG quality settings. The eight exposure modes can provide endless hours of fun as you experiment with the various settings. The three JPEG quality settings (Super Fine, Fine, or Normal), let you control the quality of the photo. This setting has most impact on your picture file size, because the higher the quality (Super Fine being the highest), the larger the file size. 

<b>Software</b>
Canon provides USB and RS232 TWAIN drivers with this camera. Photo Stitch 3.0 is also included, but I have not yet used it. They also offer Canon Zoom Browser EX2.0, Canon Photo Record 1.0, and Adobe Photo Deluxe 3.1. This package of software adds to the overall "fun-ness" of the camera, allowing you to enter your own titles and captions directly on the pictures.  

<b>The Boring Stuff</b>
The camera offers three resolutions: 1600 x 1200, 1280 x 960, and 800 x 600.  At just over 4" x 1.3", it's a rather small camera. Its battery life seems to be measured in number of images rather than in time. It will function for approximately 55 images with the monitor on and 230 images with the monitor off. In my experience, the image count is rather low for the monitor on side, as we were getting 60 to 65 images fairly consistently. The camera's battery does seem to really take a beating during the transfer of data across the USB line. 

<b>The Bottom Line</b>
This camera offers function and fun at a good price. It takes great pictures and was inexpensive. The fun part? Well, at a recent barbeque, everyone loved hamming it up for the camera since they could see the pictures instantly. People seem to be a lot more willing to pose if they know they get to see themselves right away. We also used the camera at a community function and we were able to add the pictures to our website. This is an excellent camera for the novice photographer. Photographers with extensive experience with both cameras and techniques will probably want a more advanced camera.
