            Lincoln vs. Mustang GT.  What an idiotic concept.  I took the idea seed for this from a professional review that was titled 'Lincoln vs. Ferrarri' at edmunds.com.  I give them full credit for putting the idea in my head, but none of the concepts discussed here are in anyway taken or stolen from somewhere else.  This is a review of 2 cars, and thus it will sit under 2 sections.  No need to read the other if you read this one.

<b>Looks</b>
Lincoln is a large luxury sedan built by Ford with a 4.6 liter SOHC.  The mustang?  A small muscle car built by Ford with a 4.6l SOHC.  You think these cars are similar?  Nope, not in anyway whatsoever.  First lets talk about the looks.  Mustang has gone through the retro restyling in 1994, which brought the car back to life as it was in the danger of getting kicked out of the production line.  The 94-98 models have been favorite Mustangs other than the 69 BOSS and the 67 Shelby, but in the world of automobiles, you either change or leave.  So in 1999 the Mustang went through a complete face lift.  The car still has the retro styling of the 98 model, but now it rides higher from the ground (I don't even know what for!).  The head lights got smaller, but they still follow the wrap-around classic styling.  There is now a completely unfunctional hood scoop that resembles the outback just a bit too closely.  Ok, I don't like the changes.  But I own a 97GT so don't listen to me I am just biased:&gt;  Or maybe just jealous?  Personal feelings aside, the Mustang is an aggressive looking car.  No, there is nothing cute about it.  Its angles are sharp, and sometimes even edgy.  This works for me, but if you want something cute, look somewhere else.


The Lincoln is huge and boaty.  Nevertheless, get in front of it and duck, and the car looks like a rocket.  Seriously.  A miniature version of the Lincoln could be considered a sports car, as weird as that sounds.  Much like the Mustang, the Lincoln too went through a face-lift in 1999.  Previously, the car followed a very boxy, boaty design.  I despised the older Lincoln.  The new one, however, is a lot sexier than the previous.  The edges are easier on the eyes, but still the car is not a head turner like a rumbling 'stang.  But, the main critique that works against the Lincoln Towncar is the fact that it is the common Limo Car.  I live in NYC, and I see black Lincoln's just about everywhere.  If someone gave me a black Lincoln today, I would go and spend 2k painting it red.  Oh yeah, I would also buy a sign that says, 'No, not a Limo driver!'

<b>Performance</b>
Isn't it funny, that both the Mustang and the Lincoln sport a 4.6l SOHC?  One must notice the fact that both engines are geared towards different goals.  The Mustang is the behemoth of street-racing, reaching 0-60 in 5.5 seconds in stock form.  No other import car in its price range can even breath next to that number.  In fact, the only two cars that can beat the Mustang in a drag race are the Firebird Formula and the Camarro Z28.  Ok, this is not f-body vs. pony so lets not talk about that.  Anyway, ignoring the f-bodies, Mustang is the fastest vehicle in its price range.  (Ok please don't leave a comment telling me otherwise, because you are being utterly moronic.)  I am not making a biased claim, for I am about to let the numbers speak for themselves.  The SOHC V8 in the mustang punches an incredible 260HP.  With a torque of 302lbs/ft, and a weight of 3.2k lbs., this car will leave anything less than 30k smoking its tailpipe.  Yes, even the 94-98 model mustangs *sob*.  The earlier model mustangs could only punch 225 HP top in stock form, and lacked the gears that used the HP at its fullest.  The new Mustang solves both problems with better intake and gears, and will leave the older model 'stangs behind it as well.  I know this for sure, because I race 2000 models all the time.  The difference is, I never loose:P  I got a supercharger up my sleeve.  *evil grin*  Anyway, the mustang is the ultimate street performer that is only beaten by the f-bodies as mentioned.

Lincoln has a V8 SOHC a well.  But come on, this is a luxury car.  The big engine is there to make it ride smooth, not to make it become a blur as it passes by.  Ok, you try telling that to Limo Drivers.  They don't listen to me.  Such anger.  They would rev up their engines at red light if the car actually came with a manual tranny.  Is it because they think they are fast?  Actually, this car is fast for a luxury.  The V8 punches 215HP tops, and offers around 280lbs/ft of torque.  But boy, is the car heavy.  We are talking about 4k lbs.  So you aren't going to reach 0-60 in a blink, but when you do reach high-speeds, the Lincoln will ride smoothly.  Any speed seems slow in this car.  I took it for a 6 hour drive and never let the speedometer drop below 90.  It felt like I was doing 55 in a smaller car.  You really can't feel the speed in a Lincoln.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?  I really don't know.  You decide.

<b>Interior</b>
Mustang has a younger audience than the Lincoln.  Believe me, your college buddies will think you are kewl if you drive by in a Mustang.  There are somethings youngsters like to do in cars, so they need to realize that the Mustang is not big enough for...well, you know what.  The back seats are downright terrible...sitting in them for more than 30 minutes would have been a successful torture method in a Nazi camp.  Luckily they didn't have Mustangs back than.  The front seats, however, are surprisingly comfortable once you get used to them.  The sports bucket seats wrap your body nicely, and you will be fine driving for long periods of time in a 'stang. I have done this on the 97GT many times, and I didn't see any difference in the newer models.  The instrument cluster in the 'stang is pretty small, but it does tell you important additional stuff like oil pressure and battery life.  The 99 Mustang did not get a new interior, but why change something that works quite good anyways.  The sleek interior of the Mustang is often credited when people wonder why it sells more than the GM f-bodies.  However, I have a complaint about the radio buttons.  Change them already!  They have been the same since the 90's.  They are flat, and not turned towards the driver.  So you have to reach forward every time you need to change the channel.  Please don't change the channel while driving this car.  

Lincoln has an older audience than the Mustang.  Believe me, your college buddies will think you are an idiot if you drive by in a Lincoln.  Those things that youngsters like to do in cars?  Welp, the Lincoln is perfect for that.  Heck, its big enough to raise a nuclear family.  This car is even bigger than most NYC apartments.  Yeah, you can park your entire house inside the trunk.  This car is huge!  Its also very comfortable.  The moment you turn the ignition key on, your automatic seat moves forward toward your pre-programmed seat position while making buzzing, robotic sounds.  The instrument cluster gives you a bunch of useless info, but it looks very cool.  The only thing missing is an HUD display unit.  Best part of the cluster is a digital number telling you exactly how many miles you've got left before you run out of gas.  Its not that big of a deal, but it does help plan your next pit-stop.  


<b>Handling and Ride</b>
Ow, that hurts.  Mustang is a torture for older drivers.  Its suspension is stiff, but it needs to be.  The car can practically speed anywhere up to 150MPH (been there, done that, got the T-shirt).  At this speed you are a tire-blow way from impending doom, but Ford doesn't want you to die.  So they have given you dual air-bags, and seat-belts that somehow make you feel uncomfortable if you don't wear 'em.  The car rides higher then the older 'stangs, but its suspension is still decent enough for its price.  If you do have this car, however, I seriously recommend dropping it by 1.5 inches.  It'll only cost you about 300$.  Anyway, you are going to feel every single bump and crack on the road with this car.  You can rule the highways, but bumpy roads are going to be a torture for you.

Town Car basically chews away the bumps and the holes on the road, making them seem like ocean waves. Driving through the rough traffic of Manhattan seems as if you are taking a boat ride in Hudson river. Steering wheel precision is perfect, but don't try to take turns too sharp with this boat, otherwise you will find your back-end at the sidewall. Town Car is not a performance car, but when you step on the gas you will feel the 4.6L engine rumbling as the car lunches forth. Rear wheel drive is of much use in these situations, but driving through the snow with it takes some getting used to. Its just way too easy to spin out when you have that much power to control. Town Car is definitely not a student driver's vehicle.  The suspension seems stiffer then the earlier body model. This, with a minimal loss of comfort, stiffens up the chassis for better cornering. But for gods sake, this is not a performance car! Either realize that fact or explain to Officer Bo that 85 felt like 55. 

So, which car is better?  Who the heck knows.  Lincoln is a boaty luxury car.  Mustang is a 0-60 screamer.  They are both completely different cars, so why am I comparing them?  I don't have the slightest clue.  I figured it would be original, with both being made by the same company.  The Mustang GT costs around 23k, while the Lincoln is about 40k.  Mustang will out-run anything in its price range.  Lincoln will scare the hell out of anything in its price range.  They are both great cars, and are both geared towards different buyers with different needs. So figure out what you want to do.  Haul your kids and wife from A-B, or play catch with Officer Bo.  Its all up to you.<br><br>
