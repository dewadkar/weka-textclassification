            I bought my neon used from a private individual. It is a 1995 with about 40000 miles on it.  It is the highline edition.

I have been very happy with it.  When I bought the car I knew it was not a top of the line car and that is why I only paid 4000 dollars for it.  

Surely, I could have bought a toyota or something like that for a lot more or with a lot more miles on it.

The door hinge tends to squeak as do the brakes when it is raining.  

The air conditioner fan does not work on the second level.  the first level work as does the third and fourth.

The power can be lacking when going onto the freeway, however for city driving it is plenty.

Plus, the gas mileage is great especially with gas being so expensive these days (25-30 mpg).
