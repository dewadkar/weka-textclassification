            I've written a couple Kia reviews. I have a buddy that works at the dealer. The Rio was the last car I drove around for a day. It was an overall pleasant compact sedan to drive. It was fun seeing what this entry level Kia had, and she showed me everything.

<b>Price</b> 

MSRP
$8,895-$12,164 
 

<b>Handling</b> 

The MacPherson struts seem to support this little sedan quite well when barreling into corners (w/P175/65R14 tires). Even the breaking is somewhat impressive. ABS is a $400.00 option that is probably worth it for insurance purposes.


<b>Performance</b> 

The Rio's hood hides a 1.5-liter 16-valve engine (dual overhead cam). She cranks out 96 horses at 5,800 rpm (Torque - 98lb per foot at 4500 rpm). The 5-speed manual transmission pops this car off a stop light rather well. Passing acceleration could be better, but what do you expect for 96 horses? The automatic transmission is slightly slower from a stop, yet performs about the same after the car is moving. I recommend paying the difference for the automatic transmission. Shifting is not so smooth, and gets old in the city. 


<b>Interior</b> 

Surprisingly roomy interior. I could stuff 5 average sized friends in this car if needed. The gauges are well in view, and the dash has a nice style to it. The stereo system w/CD option sounds pretty darn good. The seats are quite comfortable for a small trip. The window cranks and door handles are sort of cheap, but do the job.


<b>Exterior</b> 

The Rio does not lack style. The front end is almost as sporty as a Honda Civic...some say it is. The tail lights compliment the rear end rather well. Overall, it has a sporty look. Better than other cars in the same price bracket, no doubt.


<b>Safety</b> 

Front and rear crumple zones (for impact). Dual airbags are standard on all Rios. Even the Rio has an illuminated trunk release handle (in case you get locked inside)! An entry level car with the same safety features as her bigger sister. Heck, you even get roadside assistance!  


<b>Fuel Economy</b> 

Tank capacity 11.9 gallons 
Unleaded Fuel (87 octane or higher) 
Manual transmission (5-speed)  27 city & 32 highway 
Automatic transmission (4-speed w/overdrive) 25 city & 31  highway 


<b>Warranty</b>

-Limited Powertrain 10 years or 100,000 miles 
-Limited Basic 5 years or 60,000 miles 
-Limited Anti-Perforation 5 years or 100,000 miles 
-Roadside Assistance 5 years/unlimited miles 

<b>Overall Rating</b> 

Scale 1-10 (10 best) 

I give this car a 7.0. This car clearly beats out the competition for the features and price. This well equipped car for under $11,000 is on my recommendation list.
