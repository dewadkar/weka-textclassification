            I purchased the XG when my wife did research on the Sonata.  I am 6'5" so I get to test drive(test fit) the cars we purchase.  I got in and drove the newly redesigned Sonata and I loved it.  However, even though Hyundai's are reasonably priced I really didn't want to buy a new one.  So, it was either the old model, which I didn't like, or the XG that I noticed on the lot.
Well, once I got in one I was hooked.  These things have it all and I mean it all.  There isn't one thing comfortwise that they have forgotten.  There are even auto seats that move back and forth automatically when you are getting in and out of the car.  A great feature for us because my wife in 5'5"(on a good day). The amenities, yes amenities, on this car are just plain incredible.
The exterior styling is o.k.  Some people may not be able to handle the somewhat grandpaish ques.  But, I am thirty years old and a lot of people comment on how nice my car is.  I think they are astonished to see a young man get out of a sedan that looks like it's something an executive would drive.  I even had a man argue with me that it was a Jag.  I literally had to show him the Hyundai name on the back of the trunk.  This, by the way, is the only badging on the car.  Probably a good idea with the all of the negative effects from their first models.
I have had to take this car in a few times for odds and ends, but one thing, the transmission, is not behaving properly.  If they can ever fix this problem I would give this car 5 stars for reliability.  However, this problem is going on 6 months and three trips to the dealer.  I am getting a little fed up with it.  We'll see.
I do recommend this car because you get sooooooooo much for your money.  If you can handle some of the exterior quirks than this is the car for you.  You are on the inside of the car most of the time anyway, at least I hope so.  It is reliable, but make sure it is shifting properly before you purchase.  It should shift as smooth as silk.  It is quiet with just a little wind noise from the lack of over the window door beams.  This is really not a problem because it is still very quiet.  In fact, I just went and looked at some new cars(not Hyundai) the other day and I had to leave because these cars where way to loud and stiff riding.
I love our Hyundai.  I just hope they fix the dang transmission because then I would really boast about it.
