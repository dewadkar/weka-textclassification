            I was looking for a sturdy, light-weight camera I could throw in my pocket while skiing, hiking, and traveling.  I also really prefer AA batteries since you can get them anywhere and you can carry spares for very little $.  Wanted 3x Optical Zoom and 3+ megapixel.  I found cameras like the Cannon A70 bulkier and heavier than I really wanted.  The Cannon S400 looks good but is a good bit more money.  This is definitely not a camera for an advanced photographer seeking lots of manual controls -- it's aimed more at the point and shoot crowd.  It does provide 21 "best shot" modes and exposure compensation.  I'd speculate that under high scrutiny several other 3 and 4 megapixel cameras would provide slightly higher image quality.  That said, I printed a couple of 8 x 10 images during my 14 day evaluation period -- the images were sharp, I saw no evidence of distortion, and no evidence of dark corners that sometimes mar photos.  Overall image quality definitely meets my needs.  Start up time is excellent and shutter lag is low except in low light.  Shot-to-shot speed, OTH, is not super.  The camera does not have a video mode to compete with the Cannons and Sonys -- limited to 30 seconds I believe, and no audio.  I really didn't care about the video quality but it may be an issue for some.  One feature I would have liked is a burst mode -- Oh well.  So far, I have both positive and negative comments about indoor flash use -- though I've been using it mostly outdoors and haven't taken a lot of flash pictures yet.  On the plus side, the flash is a good bit more powerful than I would have thought -- seems to work well taking shots of groups of people at 8-12 feet -- perhaps useable to even a bit longer ranges.  Red eye is an issue but it is on almost every really compact camera.  The negative is the flash seems to wash out pictures of objects that are nearer the lens (you can adjust the intensity of the flash).  My wife has a much larger digital camera that I think does a better job with flash pics, but this is an area where size does matter.  I probably wouldn't buy this if I was looking for a camera to take indoor pictures of family and friends.  But I wanted something that was highly portable, reasonably rugged, and quick to throw in my pocket.  FWIW, the super tiny Pentax and Casios felt too small in my hands.  Every camera I looked at represented a series of compromises, the Casio QV-R40 seemed to best meet my needs at a price I was willing to pay.
