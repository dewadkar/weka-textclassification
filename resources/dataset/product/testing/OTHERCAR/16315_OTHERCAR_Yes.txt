            I got this camera as a gift about 9 months ago, and I've been extremely happy with it.

The quality of the photos on screen are great, and with 3 different levels of picture quality, I can take photos that can be the best size for what I need.

One Diamond- Low quality, but small file size (About 100KB Per picture).
     Great for Web Publishing, Emailing and for small harddrives with no mass storage available

Two Diamonds- Medium Quality, Medium Size  (About 250KB per picture)
     Great for local storage, non blown up printouts, cards, and home projects

Three Diamonds- High Quality, Large File Size (About 500KB per picture)
     Great for blowing up photos, large storage space, high and professional quality photographs

Additional features include a timer, red-eye reduction, auto focus, a 1 inch LCD screen on the back to review pictures, GREAT software were you can choose photo size (available on ALL HP PhotoSmart products), a serial cable, and an 8MB CompactFlash Card (enough for 80/32/16 pictures).

It has a nice, easy to handle design and the new color (Charcoal grey / black) is a nice eye catcher.

The only fault I noticed with the camera is that you have to push the button down about 1/2 a second before you want to shoot the picture, or press it down halfway and wait for the shot.  Using the LCD screen cuts down the battery life rather quickly.  

Additional needed items: Photo opprotunities

Additional suggested items: A good photo quality printer and  supply of brand matching photo paper ($250 and $25), SanDisk CompactFlash card reader, USB or Parallel (about $50), Adobe PhotoDelux Business Edition ($50), A CD-RW drive (for storing the photos) ($150-$300), a 25 pack of CD-Rs ($30 spindle, $50 with cases), Microsoft Publisher ($100).

I recommend this item to Families, Amature photographers, College Students, people who love to travel, and people who don't leave home with out their camera. (Battery life below is rated WITHOUT the LCD screen)

A suggestion to Hewlett-Packard: Next time, go USB instead of serial and make it Mac / Win9X compatible.
