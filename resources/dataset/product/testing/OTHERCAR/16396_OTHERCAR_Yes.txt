            I found my Geo while driving to work one day sitting on the side of the road looking in only ok shape. (Ok it still looks like that) It had a huge dent in the drivers side where another car hit it in a parking lot and all four tires needed to be replaced. But I instantly want this car. so I took what I had for money and borrowed from my family and purchased the car. And I tell you if i could go back and make the decition again I would. There have been times where I haven't liked the car, I just did the CV axles on it and the passenger side I had to hunt down myself, not many people must have bought the GSI model on the East Coast, because the jack shaft was seized. but even after that my car is very dependable. I haven't had a time where it has failed me, unless you want to count the time my dad neutralized the battery when he was cleaning the terminals with the baking soda water bit. But when i decide to finally go out and buy another car i think it will be another Storm.
  This car is so tough I have a Ford Probe (1990) and I have had more problems with it. That car has about 160000 miles on it, my Geo has about 206000 miles to it and I personally haven't had to many problems.<br><br>
