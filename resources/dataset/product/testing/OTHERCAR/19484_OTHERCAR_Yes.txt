            Let me explain. I will add more to this review as time permits, but I felt compelled to relay my experiences with my car.

If you want an in depth technical description of all the advancements in this car, then I suggest that you read one of the other reviews in Epinions. I don't want to seem negative, but it seems like a waste of time to read a review from someone that test drove the car for ten minutes, and then copy and pasted their way to create a 1000 word review.


THE PROS:

I purchased this car in July of 2002 and for a brief time was driving the 2002 745i and a 2001 E320 Sport. It was amazing because although the 745i was a much larger car, it felt smaller. This cars handling is incredible. When you drive it down windy roads, the car just turns, and doesn't lean. This is eery at first, because you don't realize just how fast you are going on twisted roads. That is why, I believe that BMW allows the car to lean once you hit .3 G's.

The acceleration is excellent for a car of this size. The road test reports have claimed 0 to 60 in 5.9 seconds and this sounds about right. The car just goes when you step on the accelerator, and this is the case at a stop sign, or when you are on the highway doing 70 miles an hour. In an instant, you will be well past triple digits. 

This car is an absolute pleaseure to drive. It handles and accelerates like a sports car, but will accomodate 5 adults with ease. 

The Idrive is the most controversial aspect of this car, and it has received a lot of press, and most of it is bad. I love it. Imagine this, one control can do the following. Enter an address in the GPS system. Select an address in your GPS address book. Switch between audio sources. Change Stations, Adjust heated seat temperature distribution, set the trip computers, etc. etc. etc.

The amazing thing is that this is accomplished by a knob that basically has 3 adjustments. Turn clockwise, turn counter clockwise, and press down. That is it. Give yourself some time with this incredible controller, and you will see that it is a remarkable advancement in automotive design. 

The Cons: 

Do not ever, and I mean ever, buy a car with so many advancements in its first year of production. I should have known better, but I couldn't wait, so that is my fault. This car had a problem with the sensors in the door that kept the car from going into full sleep or rest mode and would drain the battery. It puzzled the techs at BMW on three separate trips until they figured out the problem. Now I am having a problem with the trunk opening and closing properly without manual assistance. It should be fully auto open and close. 

DO not buy this car if you are a smoker, and it rains a lot where you live. You will cuss out this car the first time you decide to have  a smoke when it is raining. There are No drip mouldings on this car, and the water comes straight into the windows even if you only have them cracked a half inch! Stupid, stupid stupid. The car, and me for smoking. 

My Mercedes E320 had a much superior electric seat adjustment. This car has no adjustments for the headrests. Period. BMW in all it's greatness calculated the proper headrest height which is dependant how far back the seat is from front to back. There is no manual or electric adjustment of the headrest. I have had several passengers that were not able to get the head rest adjusted comfortably. 

Did I mention the clock? I had a 1980 Honda Civic that kept perfect time, but this $75,000 car loses a couple minutes every two or three days!
