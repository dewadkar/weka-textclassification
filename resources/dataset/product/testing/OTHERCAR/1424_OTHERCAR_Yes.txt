            I purchased my new 1998 Dodge Neon fully loaded for under $15,000.  I couldn't have asked for a better bargain!

Although the car appears quite small, I have been able to fit most of what I've needed for college in the trunk and back seats.  And my Neon has made the 300-mile trip to and from college quite painlessly a number of times.  It gets terrific gas mileage, and has been incredibly reliable.

The best part about my Neon is all the fun &quot;extras.&quot;  I bought my Neon when Dodge was running a special &quot;Fun in the Sun&quot; deal where a sunroof and CD player were free.  

I, being a college student, was definitely on a tight budget, and was looking for a car around $15,000.  A Neon was one of the few cars that even offered a base price near $15,000, and quite to my surprise I was able to purchase one fully loaded.

Anyone who is looking for a great car but who can't afford a huge price should definitely consider a Neon.<br><br>
