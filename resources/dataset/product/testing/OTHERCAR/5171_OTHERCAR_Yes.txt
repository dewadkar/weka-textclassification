            I purchased My 1999 Dodge Dakota about one year ago and has been A very reliable truck but dodge has A lot of bugs that need to be worked out.  I purchased this vehicle last year just before I entered the the construction line of work.  It came in real handy hauling around materials.  The only drawback about hauling was I blew out two sets of rear leaf springs.  

The Dakota has A smooth ride like A car and is very comfortable on the interior.  The seats you just sink into and the interior has many options.  The Dakota is A very sharp looking truck and will catch your eye with the bright metalick colors Avalable.  The problems seem to come all at once.  I went on A long road trip and on the way home the power steering pump, power steering lines, and gearbox all went bad.  I had A belt start to squeak and the water pump and fan clutch also were bad.  After about A year now and about 20 trips to the dealer the truck runs great.  

I would recomend this truck to anyone looking for A good looking pickup with A reasonable price tag, for light hauling and reliable transportation.<br><br>
