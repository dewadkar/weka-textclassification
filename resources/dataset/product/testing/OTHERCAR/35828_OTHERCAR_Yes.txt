            My parents bought me a used 1994 blue-black Saturn for a college graduation present. At first I was rather apprehensive as I had previously owned a Chevy Blazer and was more accustomed to a truck. This is definitely no truck or Corvette for that matter, but if you're looking for a very reliable car that is somewhat sporty looking, fun to drive, and not all that expensive, then I suggest you at least give the Saturn SL2 a test drive. Point of information: the SL1 is a single overhead cam engine so it doesn't deliver as much horsepower. At any rate, I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped on to the car lot. I felt like I was buying a $80,000 Mercedes because of the excellent treatment I received from the sales team. Furthermore, they assured me that each used car they dealt with went through a &quot;hundred and something&quot; point checklist before they were displayed for sale. In addition the car was under warranty for an additional year for normal &quot;wear and tear.&quot; I did encounter a few minor problems such as needing a new power steering pump, but was pleasantly surprised at the courtesy and fast treatment I received when I took it in to be repaired. All in all the car handles well, has decent pickup, and doesn't look all that bad. The real clincher though is the service you receive from Saturn and the overall dependability the car provides, not to mention the high resale value. If you are looking for a new or used car I at least recommend you check out your local Saturn dealer.<br><br>
