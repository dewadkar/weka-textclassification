            Having owned a 944 for a few years, the move up to the 968 came naturally.  My father had a 1994 968, which I really liked, and so I began the search for my own 968 in 1997.  Having driven my dad's car a few times, I found it to be really exotic and quite a step above the 944.  

For a while I looked for a 944 Turbo, focusing more on a 944 Turbo S, but all the ones I found had too high a mileage.  I located a flawless white 968 about 75 miles from where I live.  I made the trek to look at the car and I was not disappointed, it was stunning.  Garaged since new and with less than 12K miles on the odometer.  6 speed manual, grey leather, Alpine tape deck with CD changer in the trunk.  Gorgeous and bought for $27K.  

Shortly after buying it, I took it to the Porsche dealer near where I had bought the car and the service advisor recognized it immediately.  He informed me that the previous owner had maintained the car fanatically and that I had made a good purchase.

First impression was how much performance had improved.  The car accelerated briskly and the power was available at any rpm in any gear.  The brakes had also improved dramatically over the already excellent 944 brakes.  The 6 speed transmission was a joy to shift and the handling was also improved over my departed 944.  

Also, my father's car had the 17" wheels whereas my car had 16".  The ride difference was very noticeable and in a way I am really glad my car had the smaller diameter wheels.  The ride could actually be described as harsh with the 17s.  Aside from that, my 968 felt every bit as good as my dad's 968.  The car's exclusivity made it a people magnet, especially among the Porsche cognoscenti.

Living with the car on a daily basis was as easy as any other car.  My fiance drove it several times when I was out of town without a single complaint, it is a very easy car to drive.  Truth is, once you get over the fact that you're driving a relatively rare Porsche, the car is no different than other cars on the road.  Except for the fact that it goes, stops and handles better than most.

Fuel economy was unbelievable for a car with so much performance.  On my daily commute to work I averaged about 23mpg.  On the only long trip I took it on, it averaged close to 30mpg.  

Just like in my old 944, the air conditioner always kept the cabin ice cold, regardless of how hot our south Florida summers got.  The only thing I had to be extra careful with was pulling in or out of steep driveways and making sure I didn't park too close to curbs, the front spoiler on the car is very low.

Complaints were few and far between.  The quality felt a little below the 944's.  Whereas my 944 was sold with 53K miles and felt tight as a drum, the 968 had a few minor squeaks in the dashboard and many in the hatch area.  The rear hatch is the one area where the 968 fell well below the 944 and I found that a number of other 968 owners had the same experience.

My car's hatch would sometimes pop open on one side (usually the passenger side latch) and I would have to stop, open the hatch and slam it down.  At least I did not have the problem my dad had with the hatch on his 968.  His rattled so badly that he began driving the car less and less.  After several visits to the Porsche dealer it was determined that the glass had become slightly separated from the frame and that was the source of the rattle.  Porsche agreed to pay for half of the $2,500 repair.  My dad thought they were insane, it was a manufacturing defect and they should have picked up the whole tab.  That gripe aside, he had four years of trouble free 968 ownership before he sold it to a Porsche fanatic.  

Maintenance was brutally expensive compared to the BMW and Volvo I also owned at the time.  Thankfully the car never asked for any unscheduled stops in the one year and 14,000 miles I had it.  Regretfully a new house meant that the Porsche had to go and I sold it for $25,000 one week after I placed the ad.
