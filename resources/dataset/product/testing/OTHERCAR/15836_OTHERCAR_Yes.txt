             The Sony DSC-P31 is the perfect entry-level camera for those who are tired of going back and forth to the film processing store and waiting 2-3 days for their photos to return, (not to mention sitting on pins and needles hoping that they come out right). I'm sure we've all done this.

 I'll start out by saying that this camera is very limited in supply. Sony has a way of introducing a product that they have strong belief in and dangling it in certain markets to see what kind of response they will get, which I must say is a great marketing tactic.

  The entire Cybershot line is pretty good and I really don't think you can go wrong with any of their models, but the reason I went with the P31 is that it is the best 2.0 megapixel camera that I have tried. I have tried the Toshiba M25 and I have also tried the HP 2 megapixel. The Sony overwhelmed both of them effortlessly. The menu was very easy as well as the owner's manual, (sorry, Sony, we all know that you are not very good when it comes to the owner's manuals on your products). The battery life on the P31 was quite decent. I chose not to go with the optional power adapter because I have a memory stick reader and don't hook-up my camera directly to my computer. The batteries will last you almost 2.5 hours with normal use. It also has a decent movie mode that takes MPEG movie shots.(no sound)

The camera has a great feature that allows you to shoot in low light and it actually sends an infrared light to the subject to help it focus. Be careful: In the autoflash mode the camera will focus on the subject first and send out a "mimic" flash which makes the person you are photographing relax because they think that you have already taken the shot. In reality, the actual shot is about a second away. So warn the person not to relax after the initial "flash"

 The memory stick that comes with the camera only does about 8MG's which yields about 7 pictures in the high quality mode. (this is the mode that you use if you want photo quality prints). I went with a 32MG stick which was free with my purchase at COMPUSA. A 32 MG stick will allow you to do about 24 or more high quality pictures.

  The camera comes with a video cable that you can use to immediately see your pictures on a TV set. This is an awesome feature. The pictures look great on TV. It also comes with a charger and a set of nickel metal hydride batteries (rechargeable). 

  The camera loads its own drive onto your computer via USB cable so there's no need to install software if you already have a photo editing program.

  As I said before the camera is in short supply, but I feel like that will change.

  Sony really put a lot into this camera for the price. Most cameras at a price of 50-75 dollars more cannot perform up to the P31's standards.

  If you want good quality prints in a moderately priced camera, the P31 is worth a look. 

  Good luck....
