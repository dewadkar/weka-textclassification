            The Audi A4 is a compact vehicle for individuals who would rather have a feel of the road, who would rather drive the car than let the car drive them.

Our family is an Audi family. The A4 fits the need for a car that is quick, comfortable and responsive. The A6 and A8 models were too large for our needs.

Not wanting or needing the leather or sunroof (leather gets hot in the summer and cold in the winter, and since air conditioning is necessary where we live, a sun roof was not needed for cooling), our A4 was special ordered from the dealership and not bought off the lot. We did, however, opt for the winter package with quattro, seat heaters, etc. which are something we would not do without.

The responsiveness of the vehicle is impressive with the new technology that Audi has under the wheel wells. The V6 is very quick and will make merges into or around freeway traffic easier to negotiate and leave behind.  The quattro system is a must have no matter if it is snowing, raining or if you need sure footedness on a twisty and winding road. It is especially good to have on tight streets where there is a possibility of tight quarters and individuals not paying attention who feel the need to pull out into traffic in front of you. The control that you can exercise with the quattro system gripping and keeping the car where you want it to be in an emergency situation is amazing (although not unexpected).

Since I drive it occasionally, I can very much feel the difference from the 1988 90 Quattro to the 1996 A4. The A4 gives you less of the feel of the road, although the steering is lighter and more responsive than the 90Q. The bigger tires and wider wheel base on the A4 make the road easier to drive.

If you want responsiveness, quickness, road gripping fun and a pleasure to drive, pick the A4 (or any of the Audi line). Don't buy this vehicle if you think you are going to burn rubber or not have to use common sense or driving skills. Do buy this vehicle. You deserve it!<br><br>
