            As President of a non-for-profit association, we take A LOT of pictures!  Seminars, parties, meetings, new staff, you name it, and I need them FAST and good!  The Sony digital cameras that save to floppy disks give me the quality and speed I need and make &quot;handing off&quot; to other staff to load on the website or print or submit for publication is a breeze - a baby can do it!  I only wish now I had ponied up the extra $200 for the model that takes video clips, and I would recommend that anyone else do that, too; you don't know you would use it until you don't have it.  The only other drawback is it's size--this is no pocket digital camera!  ANYONE who wants quick and easy digital photos should buy this product.  Easy to use, clear controls, big LCD display for instant editing all make it a pleasure to use.<br><br>
