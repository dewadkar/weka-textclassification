            Well the A4 is a great car.  There isn't much else to really say.  It does most things very well.  For the average person, it is superb.  I have a bit of experience with this car.  My girlfriend drives a 98 A4 2.8 quattro, with automatic.  I have spent countless hours behind the wheel of the car and really like it.  The quattro is completely amazing.  It makes the car handle very well on dry pavement.  The handling was quite neutral.  In the snow the car is unstopable.  I had no problems driving through 10 inches of snow.  The engine is possibly the only weak part.  While the technology in this engine is amazing, the execution is not very impressive.  The car doesn't have much torque and seems to run out of breath about 500 rpm's before redline.  I am big into sound, and the engine and exhaust don't sound very sporty, even though it is supposed to be a sporty car.  However, the ride is excellent.  It is soft, but no too soft.  Very nice seats as well.  If I could take any sports sedan across country, I would definitely take this car.  As far as fit and finish is concerned, it is second to none.  The engineers really payed attention to the details with this baby!  I think I would have actually found the engine to be a bit more favorable if it had a stick though.  Too bad!<br><br>
