            I bought this car in march of 2000 used with only 8,000 miles on it.  I now have 14,000 miles.  This car is very appealing. The hardtop is one of the greatest feature of this car. Many times while driving it has turned from sunny weather to rainy and cold.  No problem, just pull over, put it in park and hit a switch.  The top comes up in about 25 seconds.  It's cool to watch too!  

     It is very comfortable inside with the top up or down, and the air conditioning is great.  The automatic shifts smoothly, but I still wish I could have got my hands on a 1999 with the 5 speed manual.  The supercharged four is quick, although not as fast as my previous 1989 Corvette's V8.  It is very refined inside and out, and when you are going 80, it feels like you are only going 60 or so- this car begs to be flogged, and feels very fast!!  

    All around, the best driver of the german roadster trio (Z3, Boxster, SLK) to be driven daily or year round.  I have only had a few problems, all were minor glitches having to do with the electric and the top sticking a few times.  This is my second mercedes, but first in my heart.

   My only big complaint with this car is the paint quality.  The paint scratches too easily.  Just after waxing it, I rubbed the hood with a paper towel, and it left a bit of a scratch.  I notice this also happens on my wife's E-class.  I also have a few stone chips on the hood and on the side.
