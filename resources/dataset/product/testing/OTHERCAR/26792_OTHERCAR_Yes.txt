            I am probably considered one of the more common purchasers of this size of SUV. I am a mother of two young girls (3 & 6) which obviously factored into just what type of vehicle I should purchase. I spent about 4 months test driving all the SUV's in this market segment. Namely, the Jeep Liberty, the Toyota Rav, the Honda CRV, the Mazda Tribute, the Hyundai Santa Fey and the Ford Escape. I can honestly say after driving all of them, the only vehicle other then the Saturn Vue that I considered was the Jeep Liberty. I was quite a hard sell as well, as I was a "die hard" import owner. Anyhow, let's talk about the VUE!

INTERIOR: After reading some other reviews, I have to agree with the fact that the interior could have been upgraded to look a little classier. On the other hand, I like the seats, fabric and colour (mine's gray). I find the interior quite comfortable and although the competition in this category appears to have similar dimensions, I found the VUE "feels" roomier. I had the kids to consider and although it's true that the rear seats are low, both of my children are still in car seats and can easily see out the windows. In an impact, I feel as well that there may be a added element of safety having the windows higher in the rear. Overall, I'm happy with the interior.

EXTERIOR: This is my favorite part of the VUE. I love the look of this vehicle. I'm not one to want an "un-sporty" type of car, so the VUE fits the bill perfectly! It has a clean, almost European styling and it gets checked out all the time by passers by (I even had someone comment that it looked like a Mercedes). The polymer panels are not only dent resistant but don't appear to scratch easily either.
