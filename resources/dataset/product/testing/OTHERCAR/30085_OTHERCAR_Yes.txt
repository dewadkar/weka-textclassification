            I bought this camera because my daughter had one and was very happy with it.  I, also, love the camera.  I have only had the camera for 3 weeks but have used it a lot.  I wanted the camera to capture important family events.  I was able to take pictures of my grandson's prom and graduation. It gave me the opportunity to review pictures to make sure I had good shots instead of waiting to have the film developed only to find I had lousy pictures.  Percentage of good pictures have far exceeded those taken with my 35mm camera.  The review function allows you view and eliminate pictures that are not good thus giving you more space on your picture card.  I suggest buying a larger picture card if you are planning on taking many pictures before saving them to a disk or computer.<br><br>
