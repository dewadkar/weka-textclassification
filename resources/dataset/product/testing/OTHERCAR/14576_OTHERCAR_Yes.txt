            I bought the Sony MVC-FD51 by mistake....actually I was fooling around at one of those internet auctions...I bid, I won....a Sony MVC-FD51.
Gulp! I thought did I really want this digital camera.
Well, I got it and ......wow!!!!
How great, how cool, just what I needed.
Why do I think is good about it:
1. The film is a computer floppy disc. Very convenient for all those zillions of floppies I have collecting dust.
2. The photos are good quality for the lens (and there is a close-up macro lens to use)
3. The battery lasts a long time (and the battery is the same one that fits in my Sony VideoCamera-nice)
4. Large sized viewing screen.

Bad things:
1. It's a little large in size (mainly to fit the floppy)
2. I would buy one with a better lens next time...but this one is okay by me.
3. The quality of the photos is not top quality, but good enough for me..now.

Having the film as a floppy disc really comes in handy. I just pop out the floppy and plug it into my Apple computer and then open the JPEG file in Adobe Photoshop.

Works great....hey, it's a Sony!

Yes, I do use my Sony MVC-FD51 every day. Being an artist I take a lot of photos of my art work and use it for brochures, my website
( http://www.charleskaufman.com ) and just to document me making art and family photos.

Compared to the other digital cameras in its class, this Sony has them beat...just for having the floppy disc as film!!!

Do I recommend it? Yes, and I would recommend any of the other Sony digital cameras, too.
