            The Agfa 1280 is the perfect camera for the beginner or the professional. As a matter of fact, a Doctor who was s-o-o-o pleased with the quality of Agfa Medical Imaging, recommend the 1280 to me. He was so enthused about his 1280, that he couldn't contain his enthusiasm! Yes, the 1280 is that good.

I'll not bore you with the usual &quot;Pro&quot; Camera &quot;Speak&quot;. However, with this little jewel, you can set it on &quot;Automatic&quot; and worry about the subject; not the camera. Of course, for the guys that like to piddle under the hood, there are plenty of goodies (settings) to play with and tweak, The documentation is full and fulfilling, especially, if you want to know how to play with the advance features.

The price is super! It leaves the comparable &quot;Dorks&quot;, Sony and Kodak buried in the dust. Feature for feature, Sony and Kodak ought to pickup their toys and take them home, wherever that is!

Buy it. You'll have people ask you everywhere you go, what kind of camera is that and where can I get one? That's what they ask me.

Agfa ingenuity may it be, Agfa Forever!<br><br>
