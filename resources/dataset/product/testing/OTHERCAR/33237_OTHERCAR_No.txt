            I came to test this little mobile with an open mind and high hopes for this car. Admittedly, this was a friend's car and I only drove it for about 15 or 20 minutes. I had higher hopes that the most powerful car maker in the world may have turned things around. After all, General Motors has designing some interesting concept cars these last few years. The General, though, has been the butt end of many, many jokes these last two or so decades with its infamous "badge engineering" policy of letting market folks decide on what to push. 

  I've driven many cars before and a few hot sport econoboxes that have been great.  Of course, coming in from a near-luxury sport sedan, its easy to be a bit biased.  But then again, I was very impressed with budget minded cars like the Echo and Focus.  With this in mind, I can tell you, please avoid this car by any means possible.

And it's high time GM moved its huge bollocks.  It has been lethergic and uncaring in its years, letting European and Japanese imports plus more forward minded domestics like Ford overtake it in nearly every category.  The few good looking concept cars out there indicated, maybe, just maybe there was hope.  But not yet.  Wait a few years to buy any of their products I'd say.

But I digress.  This car is categorized as a sporty, inexpensive small car so its competition ranges from all sorts of hot hatches, coupes, and sedans.  As per usual, the GM car is a whole class larger than the competition in size.  Through no use of any brilliant packaging, the car is bigger outside and inside.  The competition, instead, opted to go with small outside and large inside concept.  You get your money's worth of sheet metal if not anything else.

My friend had a non-descript feeling of this car. For him, it was inexpensive and small. Being an auto enthusiast, however, I was eager to give this little car a go. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm quickly dissipated as I quickly learned, this could very well be the worst car in its class. I've driven other cars of this class, namely the Ford Focus (friend's temp rental) and another's new family Honda Civic. I myself own an 2001 Audi A4 1.8T which is of course in a completely different class and it would be an unfair comparison between a small economy sport-oriented car and a near-luxury German sports sedan. 

Step inside this rather large compact and you'll be blown away by.. nothing.  The build quality is flimsy and poor to say the least.  The choice of materials is sub-par; adaquate in some aspects and extremely horrible in others.  Shunt lines are huge and gaps were bigger than the Grand Canyon.  The colours picked were drab and plain.  The plastics used were of so-so quality but you could see much of the material to be cheap and built to a price rather than to quality standards.  It makes a new Civic seem like an Audi.  While driving, rattles and squeaks were plentiful as if it was held together by Elmer's Glue.  The seats and steering wheel were comfortable enough for a person of my size (5'9) though I was suprised to see how clausterophic the whole cabin was. I have friends with Civics which are huge compared to the interior room of this car which on the outside is larger! Another friend of mine drives a Toyota Echo, classified as a subcompact, and is much smaller than this car on the outside. But the interior makes it seem like a Cadillac compared to the Sunfire. The seats were adaquate and the steering wheel was a bit thin but functional. Compared to these other cars, the Sunfire does not measure up.

Features are adequate for the price though the stereo system does not measure up at all.  Lows became muddled the slightly hint of volume, midranges were muddled, and highs were so-so.  This was the supposedly higher end Monsoon system too.

The outside, which is supposed to be the highlight of the show, is no better.  Gimmicky plastic overhangs are the name of the game with a odd looking spoiler in the back.  This car has all the makings of a boy racer mobile with its exaggerated features and its overly dramatic plastic pieces. Wavy indentions mark the side doors to give it a "fast" look and a "black mask" covers the rear of car reminiscent of the mid 90's Taurus. This is very subjective of course, but to me, this car has about as much class as Courtney Love. But I really don't expect GM to match the likes of Mercedes but I do expect it to at least be as restrained as a Ford Focus which to me is at least tasteful. 

You have your choice of the two engines: a new 2.2 litre "Ecotec" or the infamous 2.4 "Quad-4".  For any of you who desire the bigger powerplant, let me point you the other direction.  I did some research into this, and found out that this is none other than the legendary GM "Quad-4" known as the worst multivalve engine to have ever been built in the late 80s.   GM did fix it with twin balancer shafts to bandaid its horrible NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) profile, but the fact remains this engine is old.  A decade of engine design and development has easily eclipsed this deadly poor engine.  It certainly is not up to par with the smoothing revving competitor cars.  The other engine, the 2.2 Ecotec is brand new and would be my recommendation if you were to buy this car at gunpoint.  This unit sports an aluminum head and block, 4 valves per cylinder, though no VVT (variable valve timing) yet that most import engines feature.

The car I drove (a friend's car) was an SE with the newer 2.2 Ecotec and acceleration was decent.  The torque was very adaquate as GM built cars generally displace more than their class counterparts.  As per usualy GM thinking, bigger is better!  The problem is that it was not too eager to rev and felt rather weezy at the higher RPM's.  I would attribute this to the lack of VVT and a poor designed intake or exhaust manifold.  Compared to the slick Honda VTEC's, smooth Toyota VVT-i's, and my own Audi 1.8 5 valve turbo, this engine seemed eager at first but failed to inspire as well as the others with a relatively low redline.  Like most American designs, this is a lazy engine that with good torque but no ability to rev high.  However, I would recommend this engine over the 2.4 Quad-4.


Handling, however is another story.  

There's been other reviews of this car's abilities which has characterized it as "fun." This is all relative, of course, and if your idea of fun is highway and boulevard cruising at a spirited pace, then all the more power to you.  When driven to the limit in tight corners and apexes, this car disappoints.  The weight bobs and sways at even the slightest fast cornering. The generic all-weather tires squeal in pain and falls into complete and utterly horrid understeer to remind you that your not in a sports car; not by far.  Push this car into the corners and it feels like asking a 800 lb woman to perform ballet.  The body wallows with its soft spring rates and poor dampers.  Steering is  remote and indirect while a Boeing 747 gives you feel for the road.  It's also weighted poorly with heavy filtering and feather light.  At high speeds, the soft suspension and light steering made me feel very nervous.

From a technical standpoint, the Sunfire suspension boasts a strut front and torsion beam rear.  While many European hot hatches from the classic VW GTi to the newer Peugeot 307s use this same configuration, GM is nowhere as competent in suspension tuning.  The car handles more like a Buick than a Porsche.  It doesn't match its pseudo-sport marketing image at all.

Shake, rattle, and roll.  If you can find a better car, and believe me you can, do so.  Interior pieces shake, components rattle, and the body rolls excruciatingly in corners.  Other choices ?  Plenty.

Ford Focus - this gem of a car is available worldwide. This is actually a European car as it was designed by Ford Europe. Ford put a lot of cash into this car and it shows: world class handling, decent engine choices, and good build quality shows us that this car is the best compact car you can buy if its a small compact pocket rocket that you want. 
A good package altogether.

Nissan Sentra SE-R - Pocket rocket, a little pricey but a true sports sedan.  This little car is finally making a comback as Nissan itself is too. Fast, reliable, fun to fling around in, great handling, this is how compact sports car should be like. 

Alfa Rameo 147 -  A bit pricier and European only. World class building quality and handling. Actually, I'm not even sure the Sunfire is available in Europe. 

Peugeot 307 - see above.  great handling and a fun car for your European readers thats a small step lower in class than the Alfa.

VW Golf - unbeatable build quality and pretty good handling.  The base model is underpowered but the 1.8T turbo and VR6's GTi models are a blast.

Honda Civic - reliable, roomy, fun to drive on some models.  Always a steady choice.

Toyota Echo - the practical choice.  Reliable, big interior.

All in all, I can't find one good point really in this car except that you can get a bigger displacement engine than others. I suppose if you want something fast, a lazy torque engine, and is willing to sacrifice everything else, then by all means. The thing is this car isn't exactly cheap either, with the SE base model starting at $15,000!  With poor build quality, questionable reliability, horrid handling, fast depreciation, I might consider a nice bicycle instead.
