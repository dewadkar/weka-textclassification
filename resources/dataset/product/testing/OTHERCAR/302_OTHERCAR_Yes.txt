            The <b>Nissan Xterra</b> may be criticized by some as having no substance underneath its bulky, angular sheetmetal- but there <i>are</i> finer points to consider in this vehicle, recently voted <b>Motor Trend's &quot;SUV of the Year&quot;</b> for 2000.

I test drove this vehicle from a local dealership here in San Antonio. After a weekend of tooling around, I came away impressed. <i><b>(UPDATE:)</b> Note that at the time of my drive, the Xterra was marked $2000 over sticker. Today, negotiations will still be tough but the mark up is non-existent in most dealerships. Rest assured that the prices will fall even further- it's all about supply and demand. Simple.</i>

<b>EXTERIOR:  8</b>
The first thing I noticed about the truck was that it was pretty large for a vehicle in its price range. It is slightly longer than the Isuzu Rodeo, and taller than its bigger brother, the Nissan Pathfinder. The result inside is 65.6 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats folded down- roomy for a small-SUV, yet cramped by mid-sized standards. 
The tubular roof rack on the top really adds a sporty look to the truck-  Nissan needed to mask the otherwise awkward hump at the top of the roof where the rear passengers would be sitting. (The rear passengers, by the way, sit in stadium seating style because they are sitting on top of the gas tank.)
And what about that other hump on the BACK of the truck? Why, that's for a first-aid kit! Just what you needed, right? It's a gimmick, in my opinion, but gimmicks sell: ask how many Honda CR-V owners were actually swayed by the fact their cars came with integrated picnic tables, for instance. you might be surprised! All in all, though- I think the bump adds to the brawny look and I admire Nissan for their ingenuity.
The rear doors are narrow and flimsy, not surprisingly because the Xterra is <b>built on the Nissan Frontier pickup frame</b>- all Nissan did was add a rear cabin. In fact, the Xterra shares a lot of characteristics with the Nissan Frontier pick-up: suspension, engine, gas tank, dash, and wheel size- all identical. This is not necessarily a bad thing, nor is Nissan alone in this trend: the Expedition is based on the F-150, the Chevy Blazer on the S-Series pick-up, the Excursion on the Super Duty pickup, and so on...
Overall, <b>I really like the look of the Xterra</b>. In fact, if I can go out on a limb here, the Xterra is one of the very few cars (especially trucks) that actually look good in <i>YELLOW</i>. It's easy to see why this has become so popular in a market where looks mean a lot.

<b>INTERIOR:  7</b>
The <b>interior is no-nonsense.</b> You won't see a hint of luxury in any Xterra interiors. That is the way Nissan intended it, touting this vehicle as a &quot;back to the basics SUV.&quot; The seats give decent support, but it feels like you are sitting ON them, rather than IN them, if you understand my reasoning. The driver sits high. Five people fit easily, although those in the back do rub hips a little bit. The 6-speaker stereo gives decent bass response. The controls are well laid out, and the air conditioner is powerful. TEN tie-down hooks make it possible to stow your gear in any configuration.
The pop-out sunroof is a little tough to remove: first you must remove the plastic basket that is attached to the roof rack. Otherwise, it would be in the way and you wouldn't get a single ray of sunshine...
And... get this- in order to fold the rear seat forward for extra cargo, you actually have to REMOVE the rear seat cushions! Normally you would FOLD the cushions up, but on the Xterra, they just pop right out. (&quot;Gosh, I know Nissan thought of everything... but floatation devices too?&quot;) Needless to say, I found this rather strange.

<b>ENGINE:  6</b>
The Xterra is slow to gain speed, and the <b>V6 should be larger</b> for a vehicle this size. Once you are cruising, however, the Xterra performs pretty well. Passing is relatively drama-free, although the automatic is a little hesitant to downshift. Its V6 is shared by the Frontier pickup and the Pathfinder. It dishes out 170HP and 200lb-ft torque. As for gas mileage, expect a slightly thirsty 16/19 MPG city/hwy.
<b>[<i>UPDATE!]</b> A new 3.3L V6 engine is in store for the Xterra and Frontier! With a more powerful engine (rumored at 210hp), I really can't find much to fault with the Xterra... Expect the upgrade probably by 2002.</i>

<b>RIDE:  7</b>
The engine for the most part is quiet, although I heard a constant hum at 55mph. The suspension soaks up minor bumps and irregularities quite well, without any rattles. Wind noise makes itself known at around 65 mph, and cross-winds really like to slap up against the truck's tall frame. In sum, it <b>rides like a truck, no doubt- but better than most</b>.

<b>HANDLING:  7</b>
Once again, <b>this is a truck, no two ways about it.</b> If you make a sharp turn, you will feel it. There is no excessive body roll, however. Braking is good and controlled, although the body nosedives during the process. The recirculating ball steering could be a bit more responsive, but is just fine for parking or quick changes in direction. 

<b><i>(OFF-ROAD:)</i></b>
Although I normally don't take vehicles I am testing off-road, a curious urge overcame my senses. I ended up taking the Xterra off-road only for a bit in order to try out its two-speed transfer case. While most other shift-on-the-fly 4WD systems allow you to do it at speeds up to 62mph, the Xterra requires that you do it at 25mph or less. What's more, engaging the &quot;Lo&quot; setting requires you to stop what you're doing and yank pretty hard: the lever's pretty stiff (although I'm guessing it would loosen up after a while). These characteristics put together were peculiar to me, and I think Nissan should address this dated-feeling 4WD system.
In the short time I took it off-road, the suspension soaked up bumps and large rocks very nicely. The cabin was quiet and rattle-free. Be warned, however, that the spare tire is located UNDER the vehicle. This is not the placement of choice for real 4WD vehicles. However, most people will not be taking these rigs off-road, and in the event of a rear collision, NOT having the spare tire mounted on the back can save you a lot of money in damages. For more information on this, visit the institute for highway safety webpage.

<b>RELIABILITY:  8 <i>[UPDATE!]</i></b>
Now that the Xterra has been on the market for a while, there are better estimates of its longevity. According to <i>Consumer Guide</i>, the projected reliablity of the Xterra is above average. The rattle-free cabin was testimony to this during my experience.
Nissan has always been known to make solid vehicles. Because the Xterra is built on a vehicle that has been around for a while already, it may give you some peace of mind to know that subsequently, many of the would-be kinks in a new design have been ironed out. Take the engine, for example... quite an important part, wouldn't you say? Although I complained previously about its lack of power, it should give you very few problems. It's also been used in the Pathfinder and the Frontier pick up for some time, so it's no stranger to tests. 

<b>VALUE: 8</b>
As I mentioned previously, dealers still think they have the upper hand in negotiations given the Xterra's ongoing popularity. In theory, the Xterra is <i>very</i> competitively priced against mid-sized SUV's, and holds its own well against mini-SUV's. 
Once options get added, however, the price jumps considerably. In its barest form, the Xterra comes with a weak 4 cylinder engine, which I recommend against. Adding 4 wheel ABS and a V6 should bring the price to a little less than the mid-20's. My advice when you go to the dealer is to <i>not</i> let him/her have the upper hand. Find a quoted invoice price (Kelly Blue Book is said to be the most accurate), and use it to your advantage.


<b>THE VERDICT: BEST-IN-CLASS? DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE &quot;CLASS&quot;...</b>
Here's something that confuses me... the Xterra has all the traits of a mid-sized SUV (albeit on the small side),  yet Nissan claims the Xterra competes in the <i>mini</i>-SUV class. Professional reviews (like Edmunds.com) have seemingly been duped into believing this, pitting this behemoth (relatively speaking) against smaller mini-utes for comparison tests. 
Look at it this way: those who are looking at the Xterra are most likely looking at other SUV's equal in size and truck-like character. The Xterra, being cheaper than most, will stack up very well, in my opinion. As I mentioned before, Nissan's solid products are an added plus. 
<i><b>Is it the best SUV in its class?</i></b> Well, that depends which class you're talking about. If you want more car-like qualities in your SUV, then the Xterra (and other mid-sized SUVS) probably wouldn't be &quot;Best in Class&quot; compared to car-based &quot;mini-utes&quot; in your book. If you need minivan cargo space, then perhaps you'd prefer something larger than the Xterra. If, however, you want a nice in-between SUV that blends mid-sized with small-sized benefits, I feel this no-nonsense SUV deserves your attention.
