            When it was time for me to buy my first car,I had a lot of choices but what constrained me the most was my budget. I shop around and then I made a choice with 1999 Galant Super Saloon which I thought would already be my final. I was in the dealer's shop and I saw this 1999 Mirage Coupe. I checked it out and found out that for only US$ 12,000.00, i got everything i was looking for in a car. With all the full options included (height adjustable driver seat, power windows, mirrors, and even an in dash CD player, electronic sunroof, front and side air dams, rear spoiler, air bags) i knew that i ain't losing a penny on this car. What only bugged me was the sound quality of the speakers. So I have to buy an additional speaker and power amplifier to suit my preference in how it will sound. Generally, this car really does deserve a second look, not only it is a sight to behold for its sporty attitude but it also is as reliable as the more expensive cars. You wont go wrong with 1999 Mirage. Just a little touch up in the interior like leather seats, and then you will have one of the cheapest but the most reliable and beautiful, extremely well-designed externally, subcompact cars that is out there. Why pay for more if you can get something for less. This is one example where less money, means more reliability, beauty, and dependability.<br><br>
