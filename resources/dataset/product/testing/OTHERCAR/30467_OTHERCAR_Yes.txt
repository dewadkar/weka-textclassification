            How can a new car start giving trouble?  A car with less than 20,000 miles should function well.  Unfortunately, cars can break down even one or two minutes after getting out of the manufacturer's shop.  What happened in the case of this Toyota Corolla?

The first day I started using this car, I got stopped by a policeman for no apparent reason.  This was the first time I was ever stopped for questioning and subsequently receiving a citation for failing to stop at a light.  There was no such red light running.  There was no way I could have done this because right in front of me another driver was getting drilled.  He received a ticket.  I saw everything.  I was as prudent as I could be.  I started thinking it was all about &quot;racial profiling.&quot;  Then, I showed him my licence from my briefcase.  When I asked him why he stopped me, he responded, &quot;Do you know why I stopped you?&quot;  Silly answer.

Any way, the next week, I decided to go downtown to pay the ticket.  I drove the Toyota.  When I got to the office, I parked the car, but could not get the key out.  I continued to drive around, hoping that the key would come out at the next parking area.  I also noticed that the knob of the shift lever was loose.  Using the automatic lever to change gears from D to P became a physical task. The spring compressor was not functioning either.  I decided to drive around again.  In the meantime, I was wondering wether I would have a chance to show up in court and protest this citation.  I called my wife to announce that the car needs to go back to the shop according to the terms of the guarantee...

What could we do?  We took the car to the nearest Toyota dealership here.  The clerk threatened to charge us about $70 if the fault was ours (soda spill etc.) An order was placed.  Then a few days later, we received a call to take the car in for the repair.  10 different jobs had to be done to fix the lever!  Fortunately, everything was still under guarantee.  We ended up not paying any money at all.

Can you imagine this?  What happened to the reputation of Toyota vehicles?  Sturdy.  Good engineering?  What is up with all this good history?  The corporation needs to take a good look at these issues.  Families buy cars to last.  I am not any different...<br><br>
