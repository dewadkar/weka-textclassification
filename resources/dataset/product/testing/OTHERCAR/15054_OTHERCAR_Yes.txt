            Looking at purchasing a digital camera I decided that I needed more information.  Several of the camera's pm the market use memory packs that must be purchased in addition to the camera. One other disadvantage is the short life of the battery offered with the camera.  Lastly is the camera's lack of a zoom feature.  The Sony MVC-73 seemed to answer all requirements with a battery life of up to two hours it out lasted most competition.  The ability to store all pictures on standard 3.5 floppy disks makes for easy storage with up to 35 pictures per disk.  With the 10X zoom feature you can easily single out your child from the group picture with a touch of the finger.  Email is a snap to keep loved ones informed as children grow with .jpg format allowing for fast transfer over the web.  Looking back at price versus features and I'm extremely pleased with the Sony MVC-73 camera that I purchased.<br><br>
