            What can I say... I was absorbed by the SUV world.

I was always a car driver.  Low to the ground, cornering on rails...

Anyway.  I started to look around after my wife suggested I get a 4wd instead of another Accord.  I looked at almost all of the SUVs in both the mini and mid sized class and this is what I came to the conclusion on.

First Sight:

The CR-V, Pathfinder, 4Runner, Blazer, Explorer, the Jeep family.  They all look like fun.  I guess it comes down to how aggressive you want to look.  Already being a Honda driver, I am more of a refined looking kind of car person.  For me 1. CR-V 2. Pathfinder 3. Blazer.


First Drive:

The Blazer and the Pathfinder are built on trucks and of course drive that way.  The day that I took the CR-V out, I was warned by the sales person to not expect it to handle like my (or any) accord.  The first thing I thought was horror.  But what surprised me was that this thing actually handled better than most BRAND NEW GM cars that I have driven.  I mean there is some lean.  You have to expect that.  The vehicle is actually taller than a Blazer.  But other than that...  WOW!!! for an SUV.
The Pathfinder and the Blazer are both much heavier than the CR-V and because of this waste much of the touted power under the hood hauling the dead weight around.  I was already decided by this point and saw no other point in driving the other SUVs.


My Research:

I was looking for reliable, resale value, fuel economy, comfort, cargo....  Well you get the picture; I was looking for the total package.  Here we go...

Size:

The CR-V is classed as a mini-ute but is actually dimensionally larger on many measurements than most of the SUVs in the mid-size class.  The cargo carrying capacity is only 100 litters less than the Blazer and it is one of the larger.  In length it is less than the spare tire thick shorter than the Blazer and as above is actually higher.

Speed:

The poor CR-V takes a lot of unjustified verbal abuse here.  All I will say is this.  The CR-Vs from 1999 on have a better power to weight ratio than the Blazer, Pathfinder, Explorer...  Actually, the only SUVs that beat it in 0-60 are those that come with a V-8.

Fuel economy:

It's a Honda what else needs to be said.  Oh, it only needs to feed 4 cylinders.

Comfort:

The only complaint that I have is that I am not used to the driving position of an SUV.  Other than that, all of the candidates did well here.

Reliability:

The CR-V is the ONLY SUV that I could find with NO reported problems, NO recalls and NO horror stories.

Safety:

Other than the whole Subaru line, there is no other safer SUV out there for the same money.

Resale value:

From what I have seen in local used car books and from what I have read on the web, I should expect no more than 10% per year for at least the first 3 years.  Most SUVs drop nearly 40% or more in the first 3 years.  What's worse is you usually have to pay more for them, making your loss even larger.

Interior:

Not cheap (Chevy).  Totally functional unlike everyone else.  The only thing weird is the window switches on the dash.  There is more legroom in the back even with the front seats all of the way back than in most mid-sizes CARS.

The 4wd:

Well the big reason that everyone buys an urban assault vehicle.  The big prob...  If you are in the snow then the pavement then wet, there is no way that you will be able to manually shift in and out of 4wd when you really should.  That is why unless you are a big off-roader you should focus on AWD or auto engaging 4wd based SUVs like the CR-V, Forester or Tribute/Ford copy.

Fit and finish:

It is a Honda.  My 11 year old Accord makes less noise than Big 3 cars after half that time.


All in all the CR-V is the perfect SUV for the urbanite that is looking for the safety of 4wd and the cargo capacity of a small van with a cooler look than a van.  The only reasons for the other SUVs would be if you haul a boat or really go off-road.  Otherwise you are wasting your money up front, your fuel economy, resale value and the cost of insurance for the sheer bragging right of a larger engine.  Don't be fooled by this.  The Blazer weighs about 1000 pounds more than the CR-V.  And the rest of them are no better.  To that I say &quot;Look like a butterfly, sting like a bee.&quot;

The CR-V will take all but the V8s in the 0-60, take you on vacation cheaper and give you the added traction of 4wd when you NEED it.  If you need to move, rent a cube van.
