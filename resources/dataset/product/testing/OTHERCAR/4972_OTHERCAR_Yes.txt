            I was looking at the Passat, Camry, Accord and Maxima, but when I stopped in my local Hyundai dealership I knew the XG300 was the car for me based on my 20-25K budget.   It has everything I wanted and so much more.  

Even Car and Driver's January issue has an article about the XG that compares it to the Lexus ES300 and and Acura 3.2TL.  It has a killer warranty, power, room, a leather interior that you won't want to leave, a sleek look and so much more.  I went out and bought a new set of wheels (Lexus looking) and put them on the stock Michelin Tires. (the most expensive tire made by Michelin to give you an idea that Hyundai didn't skimp)  Now the car looks simply amazing.

Honestly people ask. &quot;What kind of car is that?&quot;  I say you tell me.  Here are the most common responses.  Lincoln LS, Infiniti, Mercedes, Lexus and Audi to name just a few.  No one has any idea and those are cars that sticker for 30 - 40% more.  

I do have a few gripes like the wind noise and not a perfect ride on choppy roads, but overall any one who feels like they would like luxury, but can't afford it, this is the car for you.  I am enjoying every minute looking at and driving my XG300 and I know you will to.  Satified Owner...<br><br>
