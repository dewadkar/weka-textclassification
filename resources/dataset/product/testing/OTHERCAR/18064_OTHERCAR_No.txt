            I bought my 1996 Neon used in 1998 with about 35 thousand miles on it.  I was so excited, because it was the first time I had ever owned a car made in the decade I was in!  Luckily for me, I added an extended warranty into the car loan, and boy, have I used it!  
As I have since discovered, this model of car is known to have a faulty head gasket.  A mechanic with experience with this model spotted the problem before I had a big problem on my hands.  Unfortunately, the head gasket job was done before the Dodge people came up with a replacement part that actually worked the way it was supposed to, so I had to have the job done again a year later.  
Since then, I have had additional periodic oil leaks unrelated to the head gasket.  I'd advise anyone with this model to have the car inspected regularly for oil leaks, and anyone considering buying to ask about the maintenance and repair history.  If the car hasn't had a head gasket job done yet, it will soon.  
I have also had problems with squeaky brakes from the first time it rained after I bought the car.  I have had them inspected multiple times, sure that they were grinding into the rotors, from the horrible noise.  Each time I have been told that they are just fine...and just noisy.  There is also a rattle that comes from the front of the car during highway driving that has yet to be identified.  
Those problems aside, I like my car.  It is roomy enough to fit five people in a pinch, but small enough to maneuver easily.  The gas mileage is still good, even after nearly 95 thousand miles.  I average about 22 mpg city and about 31 mpg highway.  Also, I was rear ended by a huge 1980s model sedan which was totaled in the collision and was hauled off on a flatbed tow truck.  I was able to drive my little neon home, although it sustained about $1000 damage to the rear bumper and trunk.  
This is a sturdy car-just make sure to check the records and look for a head gasket repair and any other oil leaks.  Good luck!!!<br><br>
