            After checking different products thoroughly, we finally decided to trade
our Dodge Caravan for the Chrysler Concorde LXI. We have always been very satisfied with Chrysler and Dodge products.  Although the Concorde is a beautiful looking design and has a very smooth ride this car is definitely not designed for people who are close to or over six feet.
When stopping at a traffic light, you must try to crouch down to see the light. Very difficult situation.
We have also had our car in different times to have the front end checked because the tires are wearing unevenly. Tires have been rotated and the front end aligned (?)  but the problem keeps reoccurring.  
Have also experienced same problem others have noted, with the front end
scraping when you pull into a parking space, or enter a parking lot. Again, I think this must be in the design.
We have had to take the car in for service because the 
power windows quit working. Twice on the driver's side and twice on the passenger's side.

On the plus side, the interior is very nice.  Lots of room for rear seat passengers. It is a very nice looking automobile and yet it still has somewhat of a sporty design to it.<br><br>
