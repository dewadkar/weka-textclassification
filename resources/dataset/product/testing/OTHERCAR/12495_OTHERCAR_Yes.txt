            Well my Series II Discovery is almost 2 years old. I've been thoroughly impressed with the vehicle. I joined a four wheel drive club and now have been into some terrain that is ridiculously rough. (Managed to badly scratch the paint irrepairably on one terribly overgrown track - oh well, that's life. )

I've always enjoyed camping and the outdoors. I've loved spending my holidays in the bush. My car has given me a real sense of freedom.  I am always planning the next trip away, and my discovery is the perfect vehicle for it.
I've accessorised the car extensively. Full steel bullbar, driving spotlights, roofrack, mud terrain tyres on steel rims for offroading, cargo drawers in the rear instead of the rear dickie seats, cargo barrier for safe cargo storage, UHF radio, centre diff lock actuator for improved traction, dual battery, 50 litre fridge on fridge slide.
I spend a fair bit of time in the Victorian HIgh Country (Australia) which has some extremely steep tracks, often badly maintained. 

Like most standard vehicles, there are a few things that had to be modified before I could go off-road (seriously off road - like for days without touching a town). The first and major obstacle is the front bumper bar. It's great for normal road use, but off-road it hangs down too low. So on my first or 2nd trip away, I bent the bumper when trying to get out of a deep mud pit. I bent it further when driving up a huge sand dune with a steep bump at the start of it. Eventually I smashed the foglights....so it was time to put some serious armour on - so that's when I got the steel bullbar. No more problems.

The standard Michelin tyres are surpisingly good. You'll get a lot of mileage from them, and the grip is quite astonishing in the dry and wet. But predictably, the tread pattern clogs with mud fairly easily, so although it's supposed to be an all-terrain tyre, you'll find your car becomes a tobaggan in the mud on standard tyres. So I got the mud terrain tyres, and that's fixed that! I cruise through muddy tracks that leaves other vehicles with wheels spinning uselessly. In fact, I'm often pulling other cars out of trouble in the mountains. (one guy had been trying to climb a  steep hill in his ute for 3 hours, I snatched him up the hill with the discovery in under 5 minutes! - It's an awesome car!.) 

The other thing that the Discovery series 2 really needs if you go offroading is a centre diff lock actuator (CDLA). From 1999-late 2001 (I think)(From 2002, Land Rover removed the actuating nut , so no CDLA can be fitted on these models) the centre diff lock could be actuated by a nut on top of the transfer case. A few after-market companies put out assorted levers/mechanisms to activate the diff lock. I bought one of these. It makes the rear wheels turn at the same rate as the front wheels. The bottom line is that it improves traction and maintains momentum in tricky off-road encounters. It obviously does a lot for off-roaders, which is why land rover put the centre diff-lock back in the series 3 Discovery. (good move!)

Hill Decent Control is way too fast for very steep hills.  It allows the car to accelerate up to about 7 km/h. (In the new Range Rover, they have improved that to 4 km/h). At 7km/h, the car is going too fast, and the car does not feel safe. The 4WD club taught a good technique for negotiating these kinds of slopes. (40 degrees or more - insanely steep!) So now I no longer use Hill Decent Control, except for milder hills (which some would consider pretty steep if they aren't very experienced.)  Proper instruction through trained instructors is essential if you want to safely travel over dangerously steep, rocky, or slippery ground. Don't fool yourself. It's easy to get injured on these steep slopes. I know of several people who have rolled their vehicles because of lack of training. 

The auto gearbox is very good, and has a reputation for reliability. It has the very handy ability to manually select  gears in low range. So you can actually take off in say, 3rd gear, and plant your foot, and it won't change up to 2nd or 1st. Absolutely great for maintaining traction in slippery conditions. (if it upchanges, you'll just have lots of wheelspin.)

On road handling is simply amazing. Add to that the fact that the vehicle is nearly 2 metres tall, and you appreciate how stable the vehicle is around bends. If you are ever contemplating to buy this car, and are wondering whether to get ACE (Active Cornering Enhancement)- get it! It's worth it! The car sits flat as a board around bends. Will sit much flatter infact than most cars which have a lower centre of gravity. This means the discovery is much safer when cornering.. Why? Well, because the car sits flatter, the weight is distributed much more evenly over each wheel, which means each tyre can maintain the maximum grip. If the car is leaning all over the place, not only will you feel uncomfortable, but the tyres are much more likely to break traction as the weight travels from one side of the car to the other. Some cars will lift a wheel if turning a bend really hard. Then all/most (of) the vehicle's weight is on 2 wheels and going sideways! Not good!

If you don't know that the fuel consumption is not good when you buy a V8 Discovery, you'd have to be pretty poorly informed. Everyone knows that! It's an older style push -rod engine from the '60s or something. It sounds great. It has lots of low down torque when you need it off road. But it doesn't have a lot of high end power when you rev its guts out. That's the nature of the beast. New engine designs (twin cam, variable valve timing etc....like on the new Toyota Landcruiser V8) improve the high end power. So they're more powerful on road and when overtaking. The discovery is a slower beast. No doubt about it. -Not painfully slow though. One thing I like about it is that I don't get speeding fines anymore! Seriously though, the Discovery is an absolute pleasure to drive on road. 

The interior of the car is different to most cars - and that's a good thing! Japanese cars to me feel all the same once you get inside. They are all using the same formula! - The formula works for most people - but it's so boring! The discovery is quite unique inside. I find the interior light and airy. The sounds system is excellent (could use a bigger subwoofer I guess). Very clean sound. CD's don't skip much at all on horrendous corregated roads.  I have actually found the (leather) seats to be very comfortable. The driving position is the BEST for off-road use.- Nice and high with a great view over the hood. Good view over the traffic too...

Passenger comfort is excellent too. Has split system air conditioning. My wife always likes it warmer than me. I heard someone refer to the split system air con as a 'marriage saver.' The rear seats also have individual overhead air conditioning vents. The cooling power is very good. No problems when we were in the outback.
If you do a lot of travelling and need to  store a lot of gear, get a cargo barrier. I can fit an enormous(!!) amount of gear in the back with the cargo barrier installed. -The roof on the disco is so high that without the cargo barrier, the storage space is wasted, or else you're carrying gear unsafely. The cargo barrier will also act as a sort of roll cage if you ever get it all wrong and roll the car. The other thing that really improves storage space are the "Outback cargo drawers." All my recovery gear (hand winch, snatch straps, chains, pulley) can fit in there. I also have my 2nd battery tucked in there too (for connection to the fridge) , as well as my air compressor for inflating tyres, and my tool kit, and fluorescent light for camping at night.

If you've made it this far, you've done well!
The Discovery is the most capable off road and on road medium size 4x4 on the market in my opinion. It doesn't have the outright power of some of the competition. So if that's important for you, don't buy it! If getting out into the wide open spaces and exploring the wilderness (AND getting home again safely)is your idea of fun, then go for a disco. I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!

My wife and I had a great experience the other day. We had arrived home from a week of camping in the bush. After cleaning ourselves up, we drove in our dust and mud covered Discovery to one of Melbourne's finest restaurants and arrived in style. That sums up the Discovery - tough out in the bush, classy and refined in the city.
