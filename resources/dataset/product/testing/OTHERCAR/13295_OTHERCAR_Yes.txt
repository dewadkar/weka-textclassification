            I own several Mercedes but I am still very impressed with the Honda Accord I bought my daughter.  We purchased a EX V6 and this car is great.  We have owned it for over a year and have not run into any problems.  Japanese cars are very reliable.  The interior is very big and the car looks a lot smaller than it really is.  It is covered in leather and wood.  The insturment panel is easy to read and everything is placed pefectly. The engine has 200hp and due to the weight, this car flies.  The sound of the engine is quite nice.  The interior is very quiet when driving.  Tight turns can easily be made in this car due to the great handling.  As I have said before the interior is very big.  The trunk is very large also and can fit many things. I still can't believe a car like the Accord can be purchased for under 23K.  There is no reason to get anything better.  Fuel economy is pretty good even for the V6, we average around 25 gallons a miles even with our aggressive driving.  Servicing the car is easy and pretty cheap.  The only thing I didn't like was that if you buy a cd player with the car, you do not get a tape player which is kind of annoying. Overall this car is very nice. It has a nice engine, quiet and roomy interior, and is cheap to maintain. You couldn't for anymore. Also the exterior is very aggressive yet isn't too shocking.  <br><br>
