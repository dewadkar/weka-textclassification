            I have this SUV for about three years now.
I bought the RAV4 primarily because it looks
good and my wife likes it a lot too. 
Styling is great,looks better than any 
small SUV.It is very reliable.Average 
acceleration and good for city driving or 
short trip to the store with good gas mileage.
Cargo room is big when rear seat is folded.

Here are the minor things I don't like in my RAV4   
Expensive,interior noise at high speed.
Hard to listen to radio at high speed due to wind noise.

    
If you like a reliable transportation  and                           going to use it for city driving or short trip I will recommend it but if you are going to use it for long commuting like I do, I won't recommend it.
