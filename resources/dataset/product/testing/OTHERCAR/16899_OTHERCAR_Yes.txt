            If you are considering a jump from your trusty old SLR to digital, this camera is the reason to do it. The ability to review a shot right after taking it, reshoot it if you like, and then email the image home is fantastic. Any digital camera can do that, but this one gives you ease of use, sound annotation, remarkable quality of images, great zoom capability, and worthwhile advanced features as well.  This camera is ready to travel. The batteries recharge quickly in the camera off 110V US or 220V European style outlets with the cables provided. Also, any computer shop can move your images from floppies to a CD for cheap. You might also be able to upload your images to a web site. You don't need to carry 400 disks on a long trip as you can reuse them.
Limitations:
- This is not a small, unobtrusive camera. The FD-95 is comparable in size to a big SLR.  You'll need to carry floppies also, so plan on a bag.
- I have had a 2% failure rate writing images to floppies. (Might be the disks. Buy good disks!)
- Action shots are harder as the image capture is slower than with an SLR. You'll need to anticipate your shot.
- The placement of the LCD view screen is perfect for catching nose prints.
- No JPEG viewer/editor is provided, though you can download a great one from CompuPic for ($).
- No warranty comes in the box. 5 year third-party warranties are about ($).
- Only one battery pack is provided. The NP-F550 pack outlasts the NP-F330 supplied with the camera and runs about($).
- The manual covers only function.
- Consider buying a CD burner if you take lots of photos. ($).

Even with the issues noted above, this is a great camera. Enjoy your new toy! You won't look back.<br><br>
