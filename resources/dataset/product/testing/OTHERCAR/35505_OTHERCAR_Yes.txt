            You gotta love those automatic doors on the new Odysseys. You're walking up to the car, squirming baby in one arm, bulging groceries in the other, you push a little button on your key fob and voil�, the doors open, kid gets seated without crying and groceries put down without bag ripping. It's a great feature. But the door that opens automatically, closes automatically. When you're test-driving the car � well, wait till you're stopped � put your body half in and half out of the van and close the door. Ouch! It keeps closing! Since mini-vans are made mostly for people with kids, how did Honda manage to engineer a feature that has the potential to seriously hurt a small child?

Having gotten that off my mind, the Odyssey is a great mini-van. It has a really comfortable ride and offers most of the things we all value in a mini-van, like tons of places to set drinks. The third seat feature � it folds down into the floor so that the back is flat � is super easy to use. For that matter, on a recent 7-hour road trip with the kids, we took out one of the two middle seats to make room for a little TV/VCR; easily a one-person job.

I also really like the climate control system. The kids in the way back can be as comfortable as the grown-ups up front. A small beef: the sound system is weak.

All in all, it was a very good purchase.<br>
