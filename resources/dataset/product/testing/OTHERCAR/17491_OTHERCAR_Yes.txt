            I bought this car used from my father in law.  He loved it but replaces his car every 3 years (he leases) when this care came up off lease, I told him not to turn it in and let me buy out the lease.  
Ours is the 960 Wagon.  This car has leather everything, moon roof, heated seats, cd changer, the works (no built in cell phone)
The car currently is quickly closing in on 100,000 miles and I must say this engine still feels and runs like it is brand new.  What an incredibly reliable automobile this has been.  It has never failed me or my father in law, never left us stranded, never gave us any problems whatsoever.
I have owned many cars over the years and this is BY FAR the most reliable car I have owned.  I still enjoy driving it very very much.  It is a big heavy car with a great ride (especially when mated with Michelin MXV4 tires)  It gets respectable gas mileage (mid 20s) has CAVERNOUS storage space, and I do mean HUGE.  The rear seats fold down flat and enables you to fit humungous boxes in here...I brought home a very large treadmill, in the box with this car and closed the tail gate to boot !  The guy at sports authority was amazed it fit !

This car has been everything I would expect from a luxury wagon and more.  Great ride, goes pretty good when you step on the gas, handles very well for a big car, and is super reliable.

My only gripe (and this is my father in laws fault for not having it fixed) is Volvo was using some enviornmentally friendly glue on the leather door panels.  This glue failed in the corners and the leather is wrinkled in the corners.  This would have been fixed under warranty but my father in law neglected to mention it to the dealer...very small flaw in this otherwise almost perfect gem.
I feel very safe transporting my family in this car, it has dual air bags, anti lock brakes, and a host of other built in safety features.
