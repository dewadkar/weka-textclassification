            Its time again for me to review another Vehicle.  As a consultant for GM it is part of my job to test drive and give my opinion of their vehicles.  This week my car was the DeVille.  My first impression when I get into the car is its size.  This car is BIG! tons of room on the inside and plenty of cargo space.  I myself think this vehicle is too large.  I enjoy luxury like anyone else but I feel that too much room is uncomfortable.  The bucket seats are wider than normal and I had a tendency to slide back and forth.  I did not feel quite as secure as I'd like.  Also it is slightly difficult to set the memory on the seats.  Once you adjust the seat to the way you like it you must set it into memory.  If you don't, it reverts back to the factory settings which is all the way forward making it very difficult to get into the car.  I found the ride to be acceptable for a large car but it has a tendency to roll from left to right--kind of like a boat.  I found the heating system to be adequate and the ON-STAR feature to be acceptable when trying to get directions. I was disappointed in the sound system.  It did not have the Bose system that many of the other high end GM cars have.  Although it sounded nice it lacked the fullness of tone quality that the BOSE system has. The dashboard displays are nice, however i did not like the speedometer.  The numbers go in increments of 20 which i do not like.  When your going down the freeway it makes it difficult to tell if you are going 55 when the speedometer goes from 40 to 60.  I feel if they had a speedometer in increments of 5 or 10 it would be much easier.

Overall I would give this vehicle a 6 on a scale of 1-10.  It fits very nicely for those people that enjoy size over comfort.  It has reasonable power but a bit sluggish under acceleration.  

This is supposed to be Cadillac's best luxury car, but I find it lacking in some aspects.  I suggest that GM go back to the drawing board and make some adjustments.<br><br>
