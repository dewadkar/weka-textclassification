            I really miss my car. We had a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am SE. It was the best car we have ever owned.  We sold it to buy a minivan because we just had our 4th child.  If it wasn't for that,we would have kept it a good while longer.  The only problem we ever had was with the motor for the power windows and a leak in the trunk.  I would buy another one without a second thought.  It was such a comfortable ride.  My husband liked it because it didn't look like a &quot;family car&quot;, but was large enough for us all to fit comfortably.  We would recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
