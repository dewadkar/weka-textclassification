            Anyone remember Daewoo? Korean company selling, in the US anyway, rebadged Euro Gms well past their sell-by date via revolutionary (and not always successful) attempts at redefining the showroom. Whilst flourishing in Europe and Asia Daewoo lost big in North America and retired to lick its wounds in Korea. But now, like Gloria Gaynor&#146s back pain, they&#146re back&#133 well kinda. &#145Cause now they&#146re called Suzuki, or something. 

Okay explanation time. Suzuki is the largest manufacturer of small cars in the world, they&#146re good at it, the Ignis is a little cracker in 1.5 form and lots of auto firms have them build small, cheap, tough cars and then rebadge them. Good for Suzuki. Suzuki also has some brand recognition and a degree of longevity in the US &#150 some essential credibility. What it didn&#146t have was a mid-sized car to throw in against the more prestigious Japanese manufacturers. Enter the bean counters at GM (both companies have GM people in their boardroom) and introduction of which the Brontes would have approved and you have this &#150 a next generation Daewoo Leganza badged Suzuki Verona. Daewoo is risen, Suzuki has a broader portfolio and the US has a Japanese mid-sized offer at Korean prices. Surely a recipe for success. Let&#146s see.

From the outside the car is as anonymous as you would expect. Handsome from some angles it looks as much like a wannabe cheap taxi as any of the others against which it is competing and should prove suburban enough for a Mr and Mrs Middle America afraid that it might stand out  come the car cleaning parade on a Sunday. It won&#146t, you&#146re safe.

Besides what seems to sell in the US isn&#146t the way a car looks or even the way that it drives it&#146s a ratio of goodies to price and lots and lots of overstuffed upholstery to keep the overstuffed American posterior from spilling unattractively into the side glove pockets (my favorite piece of research of recent years showed that a key factor in the rise and rise of the SUV is American obesity &#150 drivers simply can&#146t haul themselves up from low positions and prefer to &#145jump down&#146 from a high cab).

On the value front the Verona looks pretty sorted, At around $18k (in LX trim) you get

&#149 Power everything
&#149 Heated Mirror
&#149 cruise control 
&#149 speed-proportional power steering  
&#149 audio controls on steering wheel 
&#149 climate control  
&#149 leather-wrapped steering wheel
&#149 6 speaker CD system

Perhaps best of all however you get a 6cyl engine. Yup, 6cyl &#150 against the 4Cyl of all of its rivals in terms of both price and size. That&#146s the selling point, 2 extra Cyl no extra money, but before you start reaching for the calculator and lease repayment equations let&#146s take a look at that engine.

The Verona is an in-line 6 (not a V6) 2.5l developing 155hp and 177lbs of torque through the front wheels at qute a heady 5,800 rpm (4000 rpm for max torque)

Economy wise it&#146s good for 20mpg around town and 27mpg on the highway. That all sounds pretty good &#150 how does it stack up against its rivals?

Well it&#146s 20hp down on a 4 cyl Altima, 16lbs of torque up on an Accord and 5mpg down on a Mazda 6.

In other words your 6 Cyl buy you a bit of badge prestige, a few bragging rights, a rational reason to choose the car over competitors and very little else. In terms of power, speed and economy this car about matches every rival &#150 beating out only it&#146s No.1 Korean competitor &#150 the Hyundai Sonata in terms of performance.

Mind the Verona does deliver all of that power pretty smoothly. The 4 spd auto transmission (there&#146s no manual yet!!!) matches the in-line 6 pretty well, making the most of all that torque and zipping you along quite nicely. It&#146s adaptive too, so should only get better as it starts to &#145learn&#146 your driving style. Suzuki are proud of the smoothness of the engine and quite rightly so &#150 whereas some others in the class can get gruff when pushed the Suzuki is never anything less than silken. It&#146s certainly the creamiest engine I&#146ve ever experienced in a car of this size, at this kind of price and adds an air of hushed sophistication to proceedings. Floor it and it might make a liar out of me but in the day to day, slip road to freeway driving I experienced the car does the job.

Handling was less accomplished, I like my cars grippy and the 205/16s on the Verona weren&#146t really up for the job. It&#146s comfortable, predictable and safe but without traction control you&#146re going to find yourself worrying as you enter into a corner at speed and realize that it&#146s sharper than you had imagined. It doesn&#146t help that the speed adaptive steering tends to be a little over-weighted regardless of speed, a shame because it&#146s a nive addition and, when properly implemented, can really help a car.

Ride too was a little on the flabby side for my liking &#150 my liking being for the elimination of any suspension at all &#150 the more go-cart like the better. Over an undulating road the Verona does get a little barge like, pitching and yawing like a ferry on a choppy crossing &#150 it may be wise to borrow some kids and stick &#145em in the  back on a test drive as I&#146m not sure whether it&#146s bad enough to bring on car sickness or not.

None of this matters of course &#150 the car will get you from home to work / nail parlor / mall in admirable comfort and with minimum fuss and will provide a better than average cabin for you to sit in while you do it.


The car offers driver and passengers plenty of room, lots of storage cubbies and a cloth trim that grips and acts as a magnet for lint. All of the plastics used felt soft to the touch and well screwed together. Suzuki claims that the &#145one-piece upper dash is attractively designed&#146 &#150 it is. One switch operates ventilation, mirrors and lighting, the center console is inuative (take a look BMW) and the switches are in the right place, even if too many were blanked off.

Overall the interior matches any car in its class and betters some of the shoddier (you know who you are Nissan) and that&#146s a HUGE improvement for Suzuki.
The car hasn&#146t been tested for safety yet but should do okay, despite the lack of side airbags. It&#146ll be worry free too, with the Suzuki 7 Year TRANSFERABLE warranty, a little addition that really helps with resale values and should help cushion cost to own over the long term.

What then did I make of the Verona? Well it&#146s what I&#146d call an &#145Annono Car&#146 designed to blend in rather than stand out and make a statement about its driver &#150 and that&#146s something of which we&#146ll see less in the future but it does its job well and it plays a novel card. Rather than out-spec its rivals (something it does anyway) in the hope of selling the Verona plays a 6 Cyl engine as its trump card. It may not aid performance and it certainly hinders economy but as a unit it adds a smoothness that means those testing this car against a Hyundai, Nissan, Toyota and yes, even a Honda of similar price are going to walk away impressed.

A mid-sized Suzuki competing above and beyond kit for price? That&#146ll be the Daewoo.
