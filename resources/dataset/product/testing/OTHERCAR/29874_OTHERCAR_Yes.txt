            I took this camera to Africa (along with a SLR) and got wonderful photos. Landscapes are beautiful, closeups of animals are amazing. It doesn't have a lot of zoom -- but I knew that -- that's why I took the other camera as well. I normally use this pictures for things that are reasonably close, or for landscapes. It is very good for closeup portraits of people.

The downside was that I sometimes had trouble getting certain landscape pictures. This seemed to happen mostly if there was a strong contrast between the sky and the earth -- a very light sky above dark hills, for example, or a dark lake surrounding by light sand. Sometimes I could solve this just by moving the camera a little bit to one side or the other.

The camera is lightweight and will fit in a purse or a large waist pack. It's very easy to use. I enjoy being able to review and delete the pictures (although too much of that will use up a lot of battery power). I have connected it to a TV to watch my pictures as a slide show, which is great fun.

I also use this to take pictures for my website and eBay. It is very handy. I am amazed at how many pictures I can take before I have to change the batteries.

One problem is that the hinges on the battery compartment lid seem to be weakening, and I am becoming concerned that the lid may come off.

Overall, I am very happy with this camera. I take a lot more pictures now that I don't have to spend so much money on film processing. I need print only the best, and can store the others on disk for viewing.
