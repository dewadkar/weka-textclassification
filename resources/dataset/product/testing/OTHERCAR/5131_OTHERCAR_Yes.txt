            The new Dodge Dakota R/T's are one of the fastest production trucks on the market today. Almost as fast as the Ford Lightning, the Dodge Dakota sports big 5.9 liter engine that will scoot this truck 0-60 mph in just under 10 seconds. The quarter mile can be run in at 16 seconds at 93 mph. These trucks also come with a great sport suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars. There is also limited slip differential and high performance exhaust system that's available only with the R/T option. 

<b>Good:</b>

Not only is this car sporty and quick but it's also very luxurious. I've never been much of a Chrysler (the maker of Dodge) person but this is a truck that even turned my head. The exterior paint is very durable and features a strong layer of clear coat that resists scratches in the paint. The body style is very sleak and somewhat bullet shaped. All the curves are perfectly rounded for a great finish. 

The interior is also very stylish as well. It features a large amount of room for storing items, especially if you decide to go with the brand new four door club cab model. In the front seat the glove compartment can be used to store items as well as the middle compartment that folds down if you have a bench seat. The bucket seats also feature a storage area in between the seats. This storage area also has cupholders and a unique change storage area. The rear seat is a folding rear seat and when folded it adds more room for storage. The back seat can fit around four people comfortably. 

As I said earlier the Dakota R/T comes with a 5.9 liter V8 engine that sports 250 horses and 345 lbs/ft. of torque. The Dakota comes with the option of 4 wheel drive but when purchasing the R/T this is not an option for 4 wheel drive would do nothing but slow this sport truck down. It's performance is unbelievable.

The ride of this vehicle is totally smooth. The seats are very comfortable and I could ride for hours in them. The suspension of the Dakota takes speed bumps and other obstacles in the road like nothing is even there. I've seen speed bumps driven over in this car at speeds of 90 and 100 mph without even phasing the suspension or ride stability. There is also a very tight turning radius in this truck. This is great when parking into tight spaces at the grocery store as well as other places. 

Unlike other trucks that you literally have to jump into, the Dodge Dakota R/T sits low to the ground which makes access to the cab a lot easier. This will be great news to those guys out there that have annoying wives that gripe about having to jump into your ride. I know, I have a girlfriend that does this. The Dodge Dakota takes care of this problem.

<b>Bad:</b>

This Dodge gets a big F in the brakes department. If you have any worry about safety then I would suggest getting 4 wheel disc anti lock brakes added to this truck for Dodge chose not to equip the Dakota with it themselves. It slows down from 60-0 mph in 172 feet. This seems like forever though when there is another vehicle at the other end and your waiting to crash into it. In the sense of safety I would strongly suggest investing in some more brakes if you purchase this vehicle. 

Unlike the Ford F-150 and the Chevrolet/GMC Silverado/Sierra the Dakota doesn't come with the four &quot;half doors&quot; that swing open the opposite way to allow easy entry into the back seat. The other trucks are the Dakota's biggest competitors but if it wants to surpass the sales of the other trucks, then Dodge should consider adding a fourth or at least a third door.

Fuel consumption on this truck is horrible. The four wheel drive model is the worst getting about 12 mpg in the city and 14 on the highway, but even the 2wd model gets only 14 in the city and 16 on the highway. Every time you turn around you'll be filling up with gasoline and with the gas prices the way they are today this might be something else to take into consideration when purchasing this truck. There is also not an optional diesel engine available to customers.

The rear seats do not have headrests and small bumps cause passengers to hit their head on the rear windows. Talk about some real pain, I've seen some knots on the back of peoples heads the size of half a gold ball from hitting the rear window. A severe blow to the window could even cause it to break. 

The layout of the air conditioner and radio in this truck is rather dull. There is no organization and no pattern that's followed with the air conditioner. The radio is also horrible. This is the worst excuse for a radio that I have found on any truck today. The sound quality is horrible. Another thing is that there is not a rear window defroster available in the options on this truck. 

This truck is a great truck for a person that wants a sports car but can't afford the insurance or would rather have some more metal around them for safety. The price is also decent if you don't add too many options. It's also fast, fast, fast. Thanks for reading!<br><br>
