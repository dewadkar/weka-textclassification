            The <B>Minolta DiMAGE S404</b> is an easy to use 4.0 mega pixel digital camera that produces excellent prints when used with the Epson Stylus PHOTO 785EPX.

During a vacation a few months back, I spent some time with my Grandma and her new Kodak digital camera. We had so much fun taking and printing pictures that by the time we left, I just had to have a digital camera of my own. After much research on epinions and a few trips back and forth to Wal-Mart test driving a few from their collection of digital cameras, we settled on the <b>Minolta DiMAGE S404</b>. The camera�s �Print Image Matching� when combined with our Epson printer produced really nice prints. And being an occasional scrapbooker, I discovered a much easier and faster method of scrapbooking. I could now take a few pictures, download them onto my computer, insert them into Microsoft Powerpoint, add a decorative �paper� background or two, insert a few words and voila, a finished scrapbook page without all the mess and without the potential for hard to fix errors. I now had the ability to save the scrapbook pages, easily change them if necessary, email them to family, and print them for my scrapbook. And the best part was that I cut out all the middlemen like Wal-Mart photo processing and Michael�s for paper, pens, stamps, etc. I was in heaven! The printed pages are <b>GREAT!</b>

The <B>Minolta DiMAGE S404</b> fits comfortably in my hands and the LCD makes taking pictures a snap. The LCD screen provides you with the information you need when you�re getting ready to take a picture. The instant playback feature is available in 2 second and 10 second intervals and may also be disabled. I prefer it to be disabled because you are unable to take the next picture until the LCD has cleared the picture you�re previewing. The neck strap makes for better handling of the camera. My 35mm point and shoot model has a wrist strap, which is very inconvenient. The approximately 1 minute movie feature is handy for those times when I wish I had my video camera, but didn�t feel like dragging it along and trying to keep my three young sons under control.

<b>Included Items</B>

�	Minolta Dimage S404 digital camera
�	Set of four AA alkaline batteries (a paragraph on the inside cover of the manual tells what a waste these are, so why include them right?)
�	Neck strap NS-DG304
�	Lens cap LF-236
�	16 MB CompactFlash card
�	AV cable AVC-100
�	USB cable USB-600
�	DiMAGE software CD-ROM
�	ArcSoft PhotoImpression CD-ROM
�	DiMAGE Image Viewer Utility Instruction manual
�	Camera manual

<b>Optional Items to Purchase</B>

�	CompactFlash card: I chose the Lexar 128 MB CompactFlash card that was recommended by the Wal-Mart sales associate. With this card, I can take about 104 �standard quality� pictures at an image size of 2272 x 1704.
�	Batteries: I chose the RAYOVAC AA Rechargeable NiMH 1600 mAh�s because I noticed in more than one epinion that you should use a NiMH of 1600 or higher and I couldn�t find the 1800s at the time I purchased them. They last a lot longer than the regular AA�s
�	Minolta External Battery Pack Kit EBP-100: I don�t own one of these, but the kit appears to include a high-power lithium-ion battery, holder, and charger and sells for ~$175.
�	AC Adapter Model AC-1L: I do not own one of these. It sells for ~$55.
�	Battery Charger: I highly recommend the RAYOVAC 1-Hour Charger for NiMH & NiCd batteries of the AA, AAA & 9-volt variety. The 1-Hour feature is necessary in my household where battery consumption is high.
�	Photo Printer: I highly recommend the Epson Stylus PHOTO 785EPX.
�	IR Remote Control RC-3: I have yet to purchase this, but it sells for about $22. I will eventually purchase this because I miss the �clicker� I have on my point and shoot 35mm Fujifilm Discovery 312 Zoom Date.

<B>Issues</B>

�	The battery life makes the camera annoying at times. If you�re going anywhere with it, make sure to have freshly charged batteries in the camera as well as a back up foursome or so. I have not purchased the optional external power supply or the optional external battery pack so I�m not sure if those would allow for longer camera use.
�	The FlashCard must be purchased separately. Make sure you purchase the biggest one you can afford so that you don�t have to carry as many FlashCards with you on a trip. And make sure to purchase the FlashCard that fits in your particular camera.
�	The �mode dial� is quite touchy. It is so easy to accidentally turn the camera on when you set it down or place it in a bag, which of course kills your battery life and could damage your camera since the lens pops out. I am used to this problem since my FujiFilm Discovery has the same problem, it�s just not soooo touchy.
�	Pictures of moving subjects blur.
�	Using the viewfinder to take a picture captures a different image than you think it will. So, either I do not know how to use the camera properly, or they wanted to make it look and feel as similar to a point and shoot 35mm camera as they could

<B>Conclusion</B>

My experiences with the <B>Minolta DiMAGE S404</B> have been extremely positive over the last few months since we purchased it. So positive in fact, that I haven�t used my 35mm Fujifilm Discovery 312 Zoom Date since. I don�t know how novice to advanced photographers would feel about this camera, but as a real beginning photographer, I just love it. It does everything I need and lots more. All of the camera features were a bit intimidating to me at first, so I started out slowly with the basics of the camera (point, shoot, download, erase, repeat). I try to learn about the features of the camera as I have time to experiment with it. I have to say that it has made my scrapbooking so much easier and less time consuming. I can create 3 pages digitally for every one I used to do manually. I can send the pages or individual pictures with ease to the Grandparents and other family members with ease. I�ve even impressed the family with the images I�ve printed out on my Epson Stylus PHOTO 785EPX and sent to them. They have no idea they were taken with a digital camera and printed at home. The <B>Minolta DiMAGE S404</B> has been and will continue to be an excellent digital camera for our family�s needs. And the price is just right. I would highly recommend the <B>Minolta DiMAGE S404</B> to any beginning photographer who is in the market for a reasonably priced 4.0 megapixel digital camera.
