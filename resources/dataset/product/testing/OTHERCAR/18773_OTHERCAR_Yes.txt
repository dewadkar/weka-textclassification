              A year or so ago, my husband switched jobs and in the process, was left without a vehicle, since his old company provided him a company car.  We had to get a good reliable car quickly for him to use to commute to his new job.  After all of the looking around and comparing, we decided on a 1997 Kia Sephia (used with 7,000 miles).
  My husband uses this car heavily (over 25,000 miles a year to commute to and from his job), and it has been very reliable.  It's also got a nice look - ours is dark blue and unless you are close enough to see that it's a Kia, you might guess that it's a more costly car.  We've never had any problems with it and besides an oil change now and then, it's very low maintenance.  The gas mileage is extremely good and it's roomy enough for a family of four to be comfortable traveling in.  
  The only down side that I could think of buying this car is that it is a smaller car.  If you're looking for something with lots of extra space, this might not please.  Although, as far as leg and elbow room go, I have no complaints!  If you're looking for a smaller car - I would definitely recommend taking a look at these.<br><br>
