            Last summer, when my  mechanic said it would cost at least $ 500 to make the A/C on my`91 Taurus work again, my wife &amp; I decided to look at getting another car.
We were doing a little bit better financially this time, so I wanted to get at the least a car with a Sunroof &amp; CD player.  However, when we started looking at cars via the Internet, everything Japanese with that kind of equipment was going for  15K +.  
We took a step back and realized that the Taurus had 144K Trouble-Free miles (Purchased with 50K)  Therefore, we should at least look at Taurus' and Sables again.  From Consumers, I found out that the `96's weren't that good.  (In general, never buy any car the first year it's out or 1st year of a major re-design.)
I went to the Ford dealer that a client of mine buys a lot of vans from.  He had a `Gold 97 4 door GS with Leather, Sunroof, 6 CD-Player, &amp; Alloy wheels. It had only 24K miles. (In addition to everything else.) 
This was a special &quot;Touring Edition&quot; Package.  Apparently it came with these major options grouped together.  One nice thing is that it has the bench seat with the leather, a rare combination.  (We have 2 kids and in-laws without a car of their own, so the extra space helps.)
If you are looking for a Sable and want Leather, Sunroof and/or a CD Player, definitely search out one of these models. 
The car rides very nicely, without any problems (Although I've only put on 5K  miles since I've had it.)
Like I said above, I feel like I'm driving my boss's or rich relative's car, it's so nice.
One thing to watch out for:  Your head when getting in the back seat.  I've had several adults get &quot;clunked&quot; when getting into the back.  I'm pretty anal about Gas Mileage and have been averaging around 20 MPG with a lot of driving around NYC.  When I went on a trip I got around 27.  Previously with my Taurus I was getting 2 MPG better.
I've talked with other owners, and nobody has had anything bad to say about it.  One guy had a 93 that gave him some problems, but when he was looking at another car, went back to the Sable because no other car was as good a value.

However, I'd look at Carfax before getting one, as taurus' and Sables are frequently used in Fleets.  Chances are if you get one with Luxury options it would have been returned from a lease, with only 1 driver though.
