            In November of 1997 my fiance and I purchased a Kia Sephia LS model. The number one reason we bought this car was because of the price. We got it for approximately $13,000. We had to find something in a lower price range because we had a $10,000 carry-over. I admit, we were guilty, like so many other people out there, you assume the car is &quot;crap&quot; because it's cheap. We were taking a chance. The car hadn't been around in our area (northeast US) for very long and we didn't have any opinions to go on.

 The car looks good (we got the spoiler), rides nice, and does not suck up gas. We've taken this car to Canada and back, and countless other day trips. Two and a half years and 50,000 miles later we have had no problems. The seats are comfortable, the interior is roomy, and the trunk gives you plenty of space for just about anything. The car has amazing get-up-and-go for a four cylinder. It can hug even the sharpest of corners, and the take off is unbelievably fast. Some of the specifications include:
1.8 liter 
16 valve DOHC
125 horsepower
brakes- front disc, rear drum
gas tank capacity- approx 13 gallons
mileage per gallon- 22/city, 32/highway (automatic transmission)  

There are two things I would like to give everyone a &quot;head's up&quot; about, though:
 1.Very low resale value. We took it to a dealer a few weeks ago, and were told they would give us $3,000 for it.
 2.Parts are not cheap through the dealer. We were told a distributor cap would cost $55.00, and the spark plug wires would cost $105.00 ( for the people that aren't really car savvy, a distributor cap averages at $20.00 and spark plug wires average $50.00). 

My advice is to call every parts supply store in your area and ask if they carry Kia parts. We did, and got the parts for the average prices I listed. We were told that for whatever reason, Kia didn't release the parts to regular parts stores and that's why they are so expensive. So, like I said, call other places and check-do not pay these dealer prices if you don't have to.

In closing, I would definitely recommend this car to just about anyone. If you don't have a lot of money to spend, and would like a mid-sized car, this is the one for you.
