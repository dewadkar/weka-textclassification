             OK so here goes I'm about to brag up a truck that when it was new in 1978 it would have been the last truck I would have bought , but that was 22 years ago so I was only 8 .
 This truck is a very rare 1/2 ton 2WD mitsubishi diesel 6 cyl. There were less than 2000 of these made and my dad being the diesel motor fan that he is bought this for less than $8000.00 brand new . Now it is in my backyard , and I couldn't be happier . 
  When my parents bought this truck I was a little shocked, it was very plain and very loud . The truck is a medium blue , and right now needs alot of tlc on the outside but not under the hood . 
  This motor is amazing , it has done everything from haul silage wagons to carrying over 3000 pounds in it's box . Why who would have ever guessed this from a 2WD standard shift 8000.00 truck? not me but my dad had so much interest in this truck that he bought one and then being the man that he is modified it to improve a new vehicle .He modified the springs , the shocks , changed the tire ply. This is a true farm use truck . Only now it's retired from farming and I have the pleasure of having it now , and until october was driving it now it needs some body work , which I can't wait to have get started.
  What are the features this truck came with?
   breaks that run off of the power steering pump ( unique, and very touchy,they are great)
   6 cyl diesel mitsubishi engine
   4 speed standard shift transmition 
       however 1st is rarely used even to start out. It's to low of a gear for the road
   AM radio
   blue vinal seat
   heater,fan
   white wagon wheel rims
   tires
   8.5' box inside ( yes this is correct)
   paint,headlights,tailgate,front bumper
ok now what has been modified?
  shifting lever bent and elongated to fit the driver
       this has twists and turns and was welded on our farm
  back bumper, built so you could run into things
       this box like bumper was a great use when my mom was sent to get farm supplies she could back up to the loading docks and actually run into it and do no damage, as well as being strong enough to hold sileage wagons , and my 2nd car when the oil pump quit(another story)
  rear leaf springs were turned upside down to strengthn box
  air shocks were added and the air inlet put in the homemade back bumper.
WHAT HAS THIS TRUCK BEEN USED FOR?
  Family trips with a truck camper on it
  Farm supply runs
  Field work vehichle
  Hauling hay , silage wagons
  Hauling over 3000 pounds of feed for our dairy herd about every 3 weeks for over 1 year
  Delivering appliances , lawn equipment from a store I was part owner in for awhile
  Moving my sister home from college, and moving us all from home to college and then our new homes
  Hauling my grandfathers  boat
WHY DID HE TURN THE KEYS OVER TO ME?
  It was time for it to be retired from the hard life , It had been repainted , hit deer , been all up and down the east coast, from Pennsylvania to Kentucky and on to Ohio then back to Pennsylvania in the same family fly thru vacation. (If you are or were a farmer you know what kind of vacations they are.)So in 1998 my dad bought a new dodge w/ 360 in it. I was given the truck and what was the first thing I did to it? Hauled appliances in it in NY. What a horse it still is . Then I was the one to do the most damage to it . I slammed on the breaks to avoid hitting deer and went into a ditch then rolled  it up onto it's side ... Didnt do much to the truck it is built like a tank . Thank goodness or I could have been really hurt . There were several local people that stopped and helped me get out since I'm short I had trouble climbing up out. After I was out the guys tipped it back down onto all 4 wheels,whata bang . Drove it a short distance up the road toa garage checked everything over and then we drove it home . The damage was so minor I drove it for another 9 months and then parked it in the driveway till spring so we can get her fixxed all up right since she is such a prize . 
 
WOULD I RECCOMEND THIS TRUCK? Yes in a heart beat and if I could ever find more I would scoop them up, they are a true treasure. Dodge should be proud to have had their name on this one.
