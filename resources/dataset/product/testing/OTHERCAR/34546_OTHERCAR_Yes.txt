            I bought my Hyundai Accent 2002 GS model about a month ago, and everything is perfect.  I have the power windows, mirrors, door locks, and CD-Player upgrade.  This car is the best for the sub-compact category based on its features and price.  It looks as if it might be cramped, but it has more room than you think.  I have ample room as the driver and the back seat even has enough leg room for two of my friends.  On other reviews for the Hyundai Accent I heard that the seat makes your back hurt, this isn't true.  There is a lumbar lower back adjustment lever that suits your back well.  The car is very fun to drive, I have the 5-Speed manual with the 1.6L DOHC engine.  The ride is extremely smooth even when shifting.  Even at 70+ mph with the air conditioning on the car drives fine.  I have a hatchback model with a spoiler and it looks really nice, for this price range no car looks nicer.  The steering is very responsive and the handling is also very good.  The dashboard dials illuminate blue and are very easy to read, they are also arranged in quite an attractive pattern.  I was even able to extend the car's main warranty to 10 years/100,000 miles (the power-train was already 10 yr/100,000 m).  I've heard that the pain scratches easily, but this doesn't seem to be the case either.
