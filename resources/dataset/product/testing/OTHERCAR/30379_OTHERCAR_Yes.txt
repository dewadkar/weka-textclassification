            Unlike a lot of people, for me it was love at first sight.  My initial reaction was "What is that and where do I get one?"  And while I may have been excited to see that Detroit's designers had finally caught up with my visions of futuristic automobiles, I was not blinded by the 'pretty' shell.  

So I went to a dealer and checked one out.  The exterior was smaller than I expected, but the interior was far larger.  The paint appeared to be liberally applied.  The fit and finish of all parts were more reminiscent of a higher end Japanese auto than of mid-priced Detroit steel.  

I slammed the doors, popped the tailgate latch, hopped up and down on the tail, and pretty much beat on the�well, what do you call it?  Car, SUV, minivan?  There's a reason it was given the designation SRV (Sport Recreational Vehicle), there is nothing else to call it.  It's unlike anything else.

Then I drove it.  The real test.  My wife and I plopped ourselves into the well-padded seats and went for a ride.  Our first stop�Dunkin Donuts.  My wife's biggest test for the Aztek is whether a large iced coffee will fit into the cup holders.  Well, it doesn't.  Or so we thought until we removed the liners and found ample room for all but the very largest of travel mugs.  Nice touch�. 

The drive was smooth on both the city roads and highway where I took it up to 80 mph with no effort at all.  The Aztek's only enemy?  Ramps!  Ramps are the only place the Aztek behaves like an SUV.  If you drive it, you will learn to read those speed limit signs at every ramp.  Luckily, the SRV has the power to get right back up to highway speeds.

It took my wife and I no time to locate a dealer with the color and style (red base model) and all of the dealers we called were willing to beat the other dealers' prices.  We finally settled on a price of $19,410 for the base model with the free camping package.  For the month of April there is a $1,500 rebate with the free camping package, so if you are looking at buying the 'tek, now is the time.

<b>(Update May 7, 2001)</b>

My wife and I took the 'tek camping for the first time this weekend.  The tent itself took me about 20 minutes to set up and the air mattress about 10.  For two people our size (5'6" and under) the accommodations were pretty plush.  But if you are 6' or over, I would think the tent package would be a wasted investment, unless they make a longer mattress.

Due to the rain we got during the night, and the fact that we needed to drive the car fairly early that morning, I had to take down the tent (about a five minute task) and set it up again later in the day to let the sun dry it out.  This time it only took 3 minutes to set up because I figured out the secret to setting up the tent... Don't pop the rear clamshell until you have attached the hooks to the internal luggage hooks.  That way the tent is in the right position.  

So, step one should be to pull the tent over the closed body of the car and attach to the hooks inside the rear doors.  Then hit the button and push the hatch up.  This will carry the tent upward and into the proper position.  Then just follow the instructions for attaching it securely and you are ready to go!

Overall, we had a blast sleeping in the Aztek.  A definitely fun experience, even for my wife, who's idea of camping, before now, was a Motel 6.
