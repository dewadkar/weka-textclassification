               We bought the 97 Grand Voyager 4 door. The reviews on this van in car magazines were good. I should have ask my friend first. From day one she had trouble with hers. What do I love about the Plymouth van? It does have plenty of room, but so do others. What I hate about the Plymouth Grand Voyager. I had to replace the belt on it 10 times in 3 months. The windshield wipers come on when they want to. The backup lights don't work unless you put the gear just right. The air conditioner had to be fully replaced 2 months after we bought it. Then 2 years later the air conditioner needed replacing again. 
   I am sorry to be so negative. It just was not what I expected. Gas mileage was average. It drove pretty good. Who should buy this vehicle? Someone who is kin to a good mechanic.           <br><br>
