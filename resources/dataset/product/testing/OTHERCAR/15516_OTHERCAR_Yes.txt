            *** 18000 mile update ****
The front tire wear and associated roaring noises still not solved. Actually the tires are not too badly worn, but the roaring is really loud - drowns out radio, engine noise, everything. On the advice of Nissan's customer care people, I have taken it back to the dealer to be aligned again (Nissan have apparently issued multiple technical bulletins on alignment, each with a different spec), and there is talk of me getting new tires courtesy of Nissan. We shall see. There is a discussion thread of thousands of messages on this problem on www.my350Z.com.

Also, while the car was in for alignment, I asked the dealer to look at a rattle coming from underneath the car. I was told I need new dampers, which are on back-order.

***12000 mile update****
At 12000 miles, I'm still happy, but disappointed by some niggles, which are common to most 350Zs, it seems. However, as is often the case with problems that arise in the first model year, these will probably be fixed in the next years model.

1. Premature front tire wear. Fix: had wheel alignment redone and the tires swapped side to side per Nissan technical bulletin. Has it worked? Not really.

2. Rattles in dash. Dealer refused to acknowledge a problem - "in a sports car with hard suspension rattles are normal". Fix: felt pads between dash and windshield.

3. Movement in drivers seat - there is a Nissan fix for it involving the insertion of washers into the seat height mechanism. Dealer in denial: "they all do that", then "the fix doesn't work" then "your seat is not loose". Fix: applied the Nissan fix myself - 1 hour and 69c for a bag of washers.

4. Grease streaks on windows. Fix: dealer applied Nissan technical fix.

Apart from that, and some minor frontal damage from road debris, and a scratch on the side from some *&^% in a parking lot, all going well. 24.8 MPG average.

***** 8000 mile update *****
- Engine has loosened up - this thing *really* flies
- Rattle in dash which comes and goes
- Strange greasy marks on inside of windows, I guess from the winding mechanism
- Fuel consumption steady at 24 mpg
- Local Nissan dealer does an oil change for $30/30mins - cheaper then Jiffy Lube
- Best car I ever owned! A grin a mile.

My introduction to the 350Z was a colossal wait with no end in sight, and no committed delivery date from the dealer. Reading the other reviews here, I figured that's just the way it is. But to my surprise, I called a few other dealers and I got the color and model I wanted, at MSRP (no extra markup), AND a good trade on my VW GTi, all within two days. Maybe supply is catching up with demand. 

The car itself is just awesome, I am really happy with it. I now have 3000 miles on it. I have never owned a hard core sports car before, so the driving experience was novel, to say the least - limited visibility, hard ride, and very very rapid acceleration. But I have gotten used to it, and now I actually *enjoy* my 30 mile drive to work for the first time in years.

Being trapped in an office job reached by long commute means that I hardly have a chance to use the car as it was intended. My driving is mainly commute and running around town. So using it as a daily runabout, I humbly disagree with some other reviewers:
1. The car absolutely does work as a day to day driver (so long as you don't need to carry more than 1 passenger or huge amounts of luggage)
2. Ride is not too hard (personal preference) for everyday usage, even over the pock-marked Bay Area freeways
3. And I am getting 24 miles per gallon (maybe I'm just driving like a grandmother)

The engine is a revelation. It makes spine chilling noises from idle to redline, but is not noisy from inside or outside. The torque curve feels just flat - it will pull from 1000rpm in any gear, and really enthusiastically from 2000rpm. The 6 speed transmission feels redundant. 5 would do.

The car feels glued to the road, with zero body lean in corners, and good steering feel without kick-back through the wheel like I once felt when I drove a Porsche 911.

The car (hard-ish ride apart) is comfortable. Not too noisy (obviously it's not a limo), and the seats don't give me a backache after an hour like my VW GTi did. The A/C is very effective, and quiet even at full belt. Surprisingly given the firm suspension there are no squeaks or rattles from the dash and trim, but I would not be surprised if some started, as the interior appears to be made from cheapish materials.

Downsides? Well, limited interior space, for one. But that's just the way it is. If space is an issue for you don't buy a Z - get a minivan. The interior looks OK, but is constructed in some areas from flimsy and cheap materials - I think the bizarre fold out center glove box will have a life span of a few more weeks only. The low front spoiler - be VERY careful when parking. Crunch - ouch - my own fault. My other main gripe is the pathetic stero (I have the standard one). It really makes an awful sound. I only use it to listen to the news on the way to work. The rest of the time the engine is music enough. I spoke to a fellow with a Touring model with the high-end stereo. He said his also sounded awful, and did not believe it was worth the extra money. I really would have liked a sunroof, but that is not available - look at the roofline and you will see why. No other downsides yet. As I get more miles on I'll update this report.
