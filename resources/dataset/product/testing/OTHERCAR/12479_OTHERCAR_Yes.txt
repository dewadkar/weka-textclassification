              I spent the last two and a half months researching the VW Passat and the Volvo S40.  Deciding which car would be best for me.  It it's not as easy as you might think deciding which car will hold out the best, which car will offer me the most benefits and which car will make me feel good about myself.  After hours of internet research and test drives I chose the Volvo S40.  I chose the Volvo for many reasons.  The major reason I chose the S40 was because of the four year 50k mile bumper to bumper warranty.  Lets face it, cars are not cheap to fix now a days and two more years of coverage than the Passat says here is some peace of mind and only adds money to my pocket.  Both cars are very attractive but since there is so many VW's out there the exclusiveness of the S40 is very pleasing.  Another reason I chose the Volvo S40 is if I have any problems with the car Volvo lends me a Volvo till mine is fixed.  I love that.  
  I must profess I love my Volvo.  After a tense day at work I sit in my S40 for a minute and smell the leather seats, the most comfortable leather seats, and begin my drive home.  By the time I get home, all my troubles have passed.  The car is a work of art and I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants an incredible driving machine.
  With all the internet services available I found Autoweb.com to be the most precise and quick acting.  They helped me find the car I was looking for and saved me (no lie) around three thousand dollars in trade in value and discount off the car.  Autoweb.com sent me an hour away from Ft Lauderdale Fl. too Stuart Fl.. I thought it was pretty far to go to get a car but the savings I got at Oceanside Volvo has made a devoted Volvo fan for life.
