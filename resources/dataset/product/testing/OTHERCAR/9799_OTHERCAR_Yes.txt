            A great car.
I drive the Town Car for work. It is a wonderful automobile (it's not car).  I think they are soundly built and well worth the money. 

A few draw backs (design flaws) are the lack of 12v adapters for cell phones,etc. There is only one and its oddly placed as a cigarette lighter. There should also be storage in the center arm rest (like the Cadillac). The Trunk is huge and it comes with a full sized spare.  

Someone else on epinions compared this car to a like priced BMW and Mercedes.  I think you cannot compare them.  The like Mercedes would be a 500 or 600 series and they cost between $50,000 and $100,000<br><br>
