            I must admit, this was my first 'nice' car. I purchassed it only 3-4months ago used. The original owner kept it in _perfect_ shape, and I only paid $3800(90k miles). the Quad4 engine proved to be quite peppy, and I had no problems with it for a good two months.

Then the trouble started. While doing accelerations, the engine would 'skip', or hesitate slightly. I added engine treatments, changed the fuel filter, and finally looked to the spark plugs.

One day under the hood I noticed a burnt residue on the backside of the head, around the second piston. I removed the spark-plug cool pack to find a large amount of coolant leaking from the head/block gasket. You could tell due to the greenish appearance. Upon inspecting the spark-plug socket I found it full of fluid. The gasket had blown on me and I was looking at a 95% chance that the head was cracked as well. The dealership quoted me a price of $1100 to simply replace the gasket. 

This is a major problem with all '92-94 grand am's(can be verified in USENET) and I had not known about. Appearently faulty/cheap head gaskets that have now cost me a lot of money. The car is sitting in the driveway at the moment until I can get enough money to have it repaired. I am questioning wether it is even worth it.

Besides the above, I really did like the car. I drooled the second I saw it in my driveway but I just wish it did not suffer from this ordeal.
