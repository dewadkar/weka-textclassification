            I had pen in hand, ready to sign on the line for the 2002 Lexus LS430 when I was haunted by my unwavering loyalty to Lexus, as I had owned a 1990 and 1995 LS400.  Just before I signed, I decided to see what else was on the market.  I looked at BMW, Cadillac, Mercedes, and Acura, and then I dropped into the Austin Infiniti dealership.  They gave me the car for two days to play with, and I BOUGHT!!!  The only other serious contender is the Lexus, but:

1.  The Q45 has a much more powerful and responsive engine
2.  The problem with the navigation system on the LS400 is that you can't hear the female voice telling you what to do if the audio is on, but the Q45 overrides whatever music you are listening to, and superimposes her voice over that audio.
3.  The Lexus has 3" more rear seat room than the Q, and that is a good thing.
4.  The Q45 has reclining rear seats (both independently), and to get that in the Lexus you have to pay $12,000 more for the Ultra package.
5.  The Q 45 has heated (low/high) rear seats (both independently), and to get that in the Lexus you have to pay $12,000 more for the Ultra package.
6.  The LS430 does have cooled front seats with the Ultra package, and that's not available on the Q45 this year.
7.  The Lexus 430 does have several settings for the heated seats, and the Q only has two (hi/low).
8.  The Lexus430 is 20% prettier on the inside (more luxurious leather side panels, with "pleated" leather in comparision with the Q.
9.  The Infiniti dealership is much more flexible than the Lexus dealership, as they HAVE TO BE--so many Lexi are going out the door the Lexus organization doesn't have to budge--but BOTH dealerships are nice and user friendly.  About 6 LS 430's are sold to 1 Q45.
10.  The LS430 has a power trunk closure and the Q doesn't--and the trunk is a lot larger on the Lexus430.
11.  The seats are MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE on the Q45 than the LS430.
12.  The headlights on the Q45 are the gold standard of the auto industry--way brighter, adustable (believe it or not) and more friendly than the LS430.
13.  The Q45 has voice command to control the audio and climate control, and the LS430 doesn't.
14.  The Lexus430 has better visors than the Q45--they extend about 8 inches farther, and there's no extension with the Q.  This is a nice feature on the LS430 when the sun is to your left when you're driving, or on the right if you're a passenger.
15.  The LS430 does have a voice recorder mounted by the rear view mirror, and that's nice if you're taking a cellphone call and you need to record the number, or if you have a brilliant thought while driving you want to memorialize and play back--the Q45 doesn't have this feature.

The Q is TONS more enjoyable to drive.  It has forward thrust that can be SCARY if you "punch it", and the LS430 has not as much power, and is way sluggish in comparison.

The Q45 is far and away the better choice this year.  Infiniti NEVER advertises on television, and Lexus does.  This disparity makes the Q45 dealers much hungrier to be flexible and to give you more goodies.  For example, when I leased my Q45 last month, for three years, our Austin dealer was more than happy to give me free carwashes whenever and wherever I wanted, for the THREE YEARS--all I do is mail him my receipts and he sends me a check.  This is important to me, as I bought a black car, and it is so beautiful, but staying clean and shiny is hard for black.
