            Some people refer to Jeeps' as just another SUV. When I think of an SUV, I see just another supped up car that would never be taken "off-road." A Jeep, however, was designed for one purpose and that was to go off-road. That's why they were used by the military in our many wars in far off and desolate places. The Jeep is in it's own class, designed so you can comfortably go on or off-road.

The overall design for the Jeep Cherokee hasn't changed much over the years, making the older Jeeps' still a <I>great</I> affordable choice. It has much room for groceries as well as people in it's well designed interior. The exterior is solid, the bumper actually made of steel. All of that does put it at the lower end of the gas mileage chart (getting 13-16 MPG) even with its less powerful 2.8L V6. It also tops out around 85-90 MPH, taking about 1-2 </I>minutes</I> to get there. The only problems I could see with the older models are the lack of power and normal wear and tear (on the engine, body, and interior). Some problems I&#146ve had with it were of parts that simply broke of old age. This is probably because I "saved" my Jeep because it had been sitting in someone&#146s driveway for over 5 years.

In conclusion, the 1985 Jeep Cherokee is a great buy. It&#146s affordable, roomy, and looks similar to newer models. It is, however, underpowered and has all the problems of an old car. The solution: take all the money you saved and fix up the interior/exterior and pop in a newer 4.0L V6 engine and you&#146ve got a sharp looking (just like new) Jeep Cherokee.
