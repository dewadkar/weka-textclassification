            We had a lease on a 1995 Volkswagon Jetta while they had that special $199 a month deal.  We instantly fell in love with our new car.  We were use to buying American cars but with a payment special like this one it was hard to pass up.  

I was about to have a new baby when our lease was coming to an end.  We loved our Jetta but were puzzled whether or not to pay off our lease and keep it our browse for a new car.  After visiting different dealerships and test driving a few different types of cars, we went back to the Volkswagon dealer.  The new Jettas were a nice looking car selling my husband instantly on their new body style.  But, I wanted safety features as well having a new baby.

We were sold on this car even before test driving it.  The new 99 models have 4 airbags now: 2 front and 2 side.  This made me feel like I would be safe if anything should happen.  There is also a full-size tire in the trunk.  The trunk can fit a lot in it as well.  Most people can't believe this small car has such a big trunk.  This car also gets excellent gas mileage.  The most we have gotten is 350 miles out of one full tank.  The gauges on the dash light up at night in a purple color.  Making it easier of the eyes but at the same time give off a bright clear reading.  Like most cars now-a-days the Jetta also has daytime running lights as a standard feature.  The sound system is new and improved from models before.  It is very good quality as well.  

When this lease runs out we will definitely get another Volkswagon if we don't end up purchasing this one.  They are very trust-worthy cars.   <br><br>
