I bought my 1998 Hyundai Elantra in January of 99 
I was trading in my 1991 Hyundai Excel with 170,000 miles on it it had finaly given up the will to drive.
When I got to the dealership I was surprised to see how far Hyundai has come in terms of product quality.
My Elantra was the first car I test drove and I made my mind up quickly that this was the car for me. 
with a price tag of around $ 9,000 it was also in my price range. 
the first thing I noticed was how comfortable this car is and how well it handles it has alot more get up and go then you would expect and even now 
with 75,000 miles later I still have no problem getting to and maintaing 
my usual cruising speed of around 85 ( I hope no cops are reading ) lol
Also it is a very quiet car sometimes in the mornings I cannot tell if I have started it or not. and above all it is simply fun to drive. 
I live about 50 miles from where I work and so I am very hard on vehicles 
I have had no mechanical problems with my Elantra although I am sure to 
keep up with the routine maintenence. However if I did have any problems 
I would be covered with my unbeatable 60,000 mile bumper to bumper 
and 100,000 mile powertrain Warranty.
which is one of the main reasons I bought this car, I like to see a company that will stand behind it's products.
Some of the features that came standard on my Elantra were 
Dual airbags, A/C , AM/FM Cassette stereo ( which I must say sounds preety good for a stock stero )and ABS breaks. 
The only thing I would change about this car is the headroom I dont have much of a problem but my husband at 6'4 is always complaining about that 
and the seats could be a little more adustable you cannot raise or lower the seat only tilt the back and slide it forward or backward.
The backseat however is roomy and comfortable and there is quite a bit of trunk space which reminds me of one more thing I would change and that is that the back seat does not fold down to create more trunk space. 
Overall my Elantra has been a Great car for the money I spent on it and when I trade it in this time 
I will probably get another Hyundai but this time I am considering a Sonata. I am curious to see what others on e-pinions had to say about it 
Happy Driving !!<br><br>
