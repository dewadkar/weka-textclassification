            Overall, an excellent camera.  I love mine, use it daily, and would buy it again!

The picture quality is wonderful.  Coupled with a high quality color printer and photo paper, this camera produces pictures that rival any commercial photo developer.  The camera stores 245 pictures at the highest quality setting � a huge plus to not have to worry about additional memory cards.

The camera is very easy to use.  Starting with the on screen menu, all camera options are easy to access and change.  Transferring pictures to your computer couldn�t be easier.  Using a USB connection, your computer actually reads the camera as an external drive and you can work with files using Windows Explorer or any other program.  (A connection via serial port is also available).

All standard camera options are available and many advanced settings as well (such as continuous shutter mode).  A couple nice features�the camera automatically creates an index file, including thumbnails of the pictures, which can be viewed on your computer.  Also, it can output to a TV (cord included) and has a slide show option.

The only problem I have found with the camera is that the write time is slow.  After turning the camera off, you must wait for it to finish writing before you can record again.  This can take several seconds.

A few other minor inconveniences�if you turn the camera to record before removing the lens cap, it won�t turn on.  The user�s manual is only fair.  Instructions are often shallow and the manual would be much better if it had an index.  And finally, like any digital equipment, it eats batteries.  So I highly recommend investing in rechargeable batteries and the AC adapter (sold separately).
