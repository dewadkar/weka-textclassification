            About a year back, I purchased a slightly used, fully loaded 1995 Mercedes-Benz S320, and haven't looked back since.  This car is, simply put, amazing.  The world-famous Mercedes-Benz commitment to quality is apparent everywhere in this car.  The interior is cavernous and very luxurious, with leather trim abound and classy wood inserts. (Believe it or not, this car is arguably higher in fit and finish than that of the 2000 S-Class!)  The Bose stereo system has 11 speakers that create a wonderful surround sound.  The 3.2 liter 228 horsepower engine is the most refined V6 I have ever had the enjoyment of experiencing, punching this large sedan from 0-60 mph in the 8-9 second area.  The ride is also excellent, as the suspension of the Benz soaks up almost all potholes and cracks on the road with ease.  

Complaints on the Benz?  A few.  For one, there is a noticeable lack of torque available in the low RPM's, making the Benz a little sluggish off the line, and two, the size of the S320 is a little overwhelming at first-it will take some time to park this car correctly.  But minor quibbles aside, this car is wonderful, and with an estimated Kelley Blue Book price of around $34,000(the last time I checked, so it could be even lower now!) this rock-solid Benz is an absolute value.  <br><br>
