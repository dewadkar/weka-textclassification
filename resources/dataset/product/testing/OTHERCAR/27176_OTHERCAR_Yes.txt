            I actually sold this vehicle early this year as I moved to New York City.
I purchased it in June of 1998 and loved the car! 
First things first: Volkswagen dealers. 
I used to work for Volkswagen Corporate in Germany and have a great respect for Volkswagen cars however the dealers in the states are below (way way below) any standards. My fiancee tried to buy a bug in Columbus Ohio and was told to come back with her daddy (she's 30 years old thank you). I showed up in jeans and was ignored for an hour and left. But I wanted a Passat so came back from an interview one day in a suit and was literally assaulted by a rep when I entered the dealership in Durham, NC.
Well, the car was in short supply so I bought a black Passat with Tiptronic, standard wheels (why pay $1500 for alloy wheels?) and cd changer in trunk (that bothers me as I prefer having the cd player up front). I got the 1.8L engine with 158bps - no need for a V6 as it accelerates well. 
I had the car for 18 months and drove up and down the east coast and never had a problem except for one:
Under the front of the car is a protective plastic layer which apparently shields the engine/wiring from gravel and rocks. After an oil change the thing fell off on the highway while driving at 65 miles an hour... I dragged the plastic behind me for 10 minutes until I heard the noise and stopped. I could not remove it and had to drive to a mechanic.
Needless to say VW blamed me and refused to pay. After 6 months of writing to VW I went to another dealership told them what happened and had it fixed under warranty.
The tiptronic is great if you like that kind of thing but not nearly as good as a stick.
Resale value: I tried to sell the car in NY and in DC as I was commuting back and forth but it took me a long time to find a buyer and lost a lot of cash on the deal. VW does not have the same brand recognition as say Toyota or Mazda. So expect to get hit on the resale.
I expect that to change as the Passat and Bug have generated higher demand for VW cars.
