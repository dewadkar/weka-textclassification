               Do you consider the Mitsubishi Galant a family car or a luxurious sports sedan with an aggressive look? Are you undecided which one you would consider it. Read on and I will help you decide.
   I bought my GTZ on June 27,2001. I'm 19 years old and I have finally decided to sell my 94 Ford Probe GT, which was also a good car, but I was tired of the sports car scene. I wanted a car that was: 
1:Dependable   2:Had a lot of class  3:Luxurious  4:Within my budget limit   5:Not a Grandpa's car(i.e. Mercury Sable)
   I did a lot of research through different manufacturers. Most of the luxurious cars were 35,000 and up. I went to WWW.MITSUCARS.com and checked out their site. I was able to build the galant right on the internet. It allows you to pick the model, trim, wheels, accesories, etc. I chose the highest model, the GTZ.
   The GTZ looks different than the other galants. I would consider it the special edition. I comes with leather, power everything, moonroof, front and side airbags, white faced gauges, a touring wing spoiler, racing suspension, 16 inch alloy wheels, a 195 HP V6 engine, anti-theft engine immobilizer, 210 watt Infinity 7 speaker sound system, CD player, Color-keyed grill/rear trim, body molded sides, solar-tinted windows and much more. There is too much to list, so any other questions of what else it is equipped with, email me at Lowsuzuki@aol.com.
