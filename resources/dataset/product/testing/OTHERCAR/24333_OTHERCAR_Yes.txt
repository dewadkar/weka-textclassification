            I needed a car desperately since my '85 BMW 325 caught on fire returning from the vet with a kitten. We both sadly looked on from the curb as my faithful old car of the last nine years popped and crackled while orange flames licked off the paint on the front end. Idiots parked in the middle of both lanes of traffic and rubbernecked as fire trucks were held at bay while I screamed at those google-eyed morons. Alas, 'ol Beemer was no more!

Three months passed during which time I was confined to the use of my '85 Chevy one-ton work van, loaded with in excess of one ton's worth of equipment. Driving to the market for necessities was a cumbersome task and I began cursing every time I had to use the faded, old blue truck. Then, one day the phone rang. It was an old friend whom I hadn't heard from in a couple of years. I told him of my predicament and he suggested getting an old Buick Century, since he had owned one for some time and was perfectly satisfied with it; not to mention the fact that my funds were extremely limited and these cars were pretty cheap.

I saw a '91 Century Limited online and called the number. Arrangements were made for the owner and I to meet and I test drove the car. Well, the car took off under my foot and was spewing gravel all over the place before I put on the brakes. This little car had some guts! The seller was asking $1000 and we agreed that I would buy the car. 

The day that I was supposed to go pay for the car I happened upon another ad for a '91 Regal which I had called about one month or so earlier. I thought it strange that the guy was only asking $1200 and still could not sell the car. The first time I spoke with the seller, he told me that the car needed paint so the day I was supposed to go look at it, I simply didn't call back to confirm a time. Rather rude of me but this time the guy said he had inspected the car and put new Michelins all around and guess what? The price had mysteriously dropped to $900! He also told me that it was a Limited Coupe (my favorite bodystyle) with leather, cold A/C, dual-climate control, criuse control, tilt, remote stereo in the steering wheel, cassette player w/premium sound package, power windows, power locks, remote trunk release, dual reading lights, vanity mirror in visor, intermittent wipers, dual-power mirrors, alloy wheels, lighted under hood & trunk, lighted keylocks on door, auto-on and 30 second delay off on dash lights, six-way power driver's seat, four-wheel disc brakes, Flowmaster exhaust AND the 3800 Series V-6 fuel-injected engine. Well, I had to see this wonder car and I made arrangements to stop on the way out to get the Century, believing there was no way this deal could be true and it would only cost me a little time.

I arrived before the seller at the garage and when he pulled up I wasn't immediately impressed. The car looked as if it hadn't had a good cleaning for quite some time but it was just purring under the hood. The body was perfectly straight with no rust or major scratches. I rubbed a little spot on the hood with my finger and could see the metal-flaked pewter colored paint begin to slightly sparkle. At that moment I knew this baby could be rubbed out - dirty but not in need of new pigment. The fluids were all clean and full and The C/V boots were like new with no apparent rips in them. The undercarriage clean and as straight as the body. The Michelins, fat and fresh with their new tread, combined with the aluminum-alloy wheels, were worth as much as the asking price of the car. The leather was a bit dingy and it was immediately apparent that a smoker had owned the Regal, since little burn marks were evident here and there. The odometer read just over 100,000 miles and I thought it must be broken. It wasn't, for when I test drove the car, the numbers began twirling and off we went down the city street. The car had a smooth and comfortable ride with tremendous acceleration. The seller advised me to "stomp on it" but I was reluctant. He insisted so I hit the gas and we took off with such force we were thrown into the backs of our seats. I hadn't experienced anything like this since with my '83 Trans Am with a 350 V-8 engine! Granted, the handling wasn't quite like that with my BMW but it is much more of a mid-luxury car than that was and those comforts are making me forget my Beemer a little more with each day passing. Every button and feature works on this car still and it has been a pleasure to drive the past two weeks. The engine is superb, the ride fairly quiet and comfortable. The four-speed transmission shifts smoothly, the stereo in the steering wheel option is my favorite and the paint, after a good rubbing out last weekend has come back to looking almost new. I'm looking at a nice embroidered set of Lloyd's customized mats right now and my buddy, who drove the car last weekend said it rides and looks every bit as nice as his mother's 2001 Century. Best $900 I ever spent!
