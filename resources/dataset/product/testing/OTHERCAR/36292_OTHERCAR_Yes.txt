            If you read my reviews, you'll know just how much I enjoyed driving the Nissan 350Z.  However it does have one problem in that it only seats two.  While that's great for a sportscar, what if you're not in the position to purchase a sportscar?  You've got a wife and kids, and you need something to get them ALL from here to there.  You, however, aren't willing to give up your Z dream.

Fortunately Nissan has thought of this, and given us the Infiniti G35 sedan.  Now you can have your cake and eat it too!

Mechanically speaking the Z car and the G35 are nearly identical.  The G35 is a bit longer, a bit wider and has two extra doors.  However the important stuff, the engine, transmission and suspension, are nearly identical.  The G35 is powered by the same 3.5L V6 found in the Z, making 260 horsepower--down from the Z's 287--and 260 pound-feet of torque.  Power is fed to the rear wheels via either a 5-speed automatic or a six-speed stick, the same transmissions offered in the Z-car.  My tester had the 5-speed auto.

The car performs and handles about a notch or so below the Z's capabilities, though this is to be expected of a larger, less-powerful vehicle.  Overall it accelerates powerfully and is quite capable in corners.  While the ride is acceptable for a sport sedan, it can be a little firm on rough roads.  It does a good job, though, of soaking up minor blemishes, giving an overall well-planted feel to the car.  There's plenty of power right in the middle of the rev range, perfect for passing on highways and squirting out of turns.

Now keep in mind this is a LUXURY sport sedan, so it wouldn't be right if the car didn't have the requisite premium upholstery and other associated accoutrements.  My car had power leather seats, a powerful Bose stereo and a navigation system, among other things.  

There were some minor issues with the interior ergonomics.  For one, the navigation system was a pain to figure out, although I'm sure with more seat time I would've gotten the hang of it.  The power seat controls for the driver are on the wrong side of the seat--that is, the right-hand side--and took some getting used to.  Lastly, the car's sleek brushed metal center stack was a slick piece, but all the buttons for everything were about the same shape and size, meaning you have to take your eyes off the road to use them.  When you're booking down the freeway at New Mexico highway speeds (80+ MPH) any distraction could be deadly.  I would have preferred a more functional design, and would be willing to sacrifice some style to get it.  One last complaint has to do with the gauges.  While the instrument cluster moves with the tilt steering wheel as it does in the Z (a great idea I think more cars should use) the coloring of the instruments make them hard to see in sunlight.  I would have preferred black lettering on white faces, or white on black.  Yeah it doesn't look quite as cool, but it works and it's legible.

Ergonomic nigglings aside, the interior of the car is a comfortable place to be, with plenty of room up front, and a decent amount of room in back.  Long trips should be relatively comfortable for two medium-sized people, but make sure the biggest guy gets shotgun or there could be problems.  Also, a lack of headroom was noticeable up front, especially with the sunroof my car had.  I was able to adjust for it, but those tall in stature are warned in advance.

Styling isn't really something I talk much about with most cars, because most cars pretty much look the same.  The G35 is different.  From the side it's nothing special, but the front and rear ends get a unique and somewhat daring approach.  The vertical-stacked headlights do somewhat recall the new Caddy CTS, but are better-implemented here, looking more natural with the rest of the car, rather than huge blocks on the front end.  The car has smooth flowing lines throughout, remaining somewhat understated but still refreshing.  The rear deck looks chopped off, with huge taillamps for good visibility and another striking detail.  At first I didn't care much for them, but they've grown on me, and now I actually think they're pretty cool.

I'm sure you're all waiting for me to make the inevitable BMW comparison, so here it goes.  Is the Infiniti G35 as good in every way as a BMW?  For what the BMW costs, the G35 wouldn't be worth the sheetmetal it's made out of.  However there's one small detail.  The G35 starts at around $28,000, with a very well-equipped car like mine going for the low to mid 30s.  Try getting a brand-new 330i, outfitted like this car, for less than 40 grand.  It can't be done.  I'd also like to give 'props' to the Infiniti dealers.  While I had to use a level of deception to get into the driver's seat of a BMW, the people at Infiniti were always polite and eager to help me, and picked out a black bullet of a car, and a salesman willing to let me explore the limits of the vehicle's potential.  The dealer experience alone would nearly make the car worth buying, but it stands out quite well on its own as a performance sedan worthy of anybody's dollar.

If for some unfathomable reason the G35 doesn't tickle your fancy, there are a few other entry-level luxury sports cars out there you might enjoy (though in my opinion few are this good for this cheap).  There's the Mercedes C-class, Audi A4, BMW 3-series, Jaguar X-type, Cadillac CTS, and the Lexus IS300 as standouts in the entry-level segment.  However nearly all of these cars are more expensive, some are more cramped, and few deliver quite the same performance.

NOTE: I rated this car 5 out of 5 for reliability.  This is a proven engine that has been refined over many years, in a brand with a reputation for excellent durability.  This car should be trouble-free for you for many years.
