            When I first got this car, I needed it for college etc.  My boyfriend at the time drove it frequently, and eventually after racing it excessively, it threw a rod.  Well, after a long struggle I eventually got a new engine and my boyfriend now and I have driven it for 2 1/2 more years.  It in excellent condition and drives great.  They say something that goes above and beyond, and still keeps on kicking is said to be &quot;old faithful&quot;. With that in mind I guess it applies, but I'd like to think maybe not,  it really doesn't seem all that old to me.  It's an attractive car, with a lot of miles-yet still as safe and reliable as ever, and it's still an amazingly smooth ride.  The point is....young or old, in college or retired, this is a car that would fit as well as please, almost anyone!<br><br>
