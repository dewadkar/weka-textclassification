            We tested the 328i when we were looking for new cars, and this car was by far the most perfect car either my husband or I have ever driven.

This car handled like a dream and accelerated like it was nothing.  Before we realized it we were on the freeway doing 95mph and the car was extremely stable.  Curves were nothing for this car, at any speed.

Plus, if you want a car that is smooth enough for the most cranky baby to fall asleep in, this car is it.  Unlike most sporty cars, this car floated over bumps without even jiggling liquid in the cup holder.

This car was comfortable, with only Volvo having more comfortable seats.  Plus, enough back seat space for two adults.

There are two downsides to this car, small trunk and expensive options.  Everything costs extra in this car, from paint to cruise control.  Plus, the trunk is extremely small so you need to folding rear seat option.<br><br>
