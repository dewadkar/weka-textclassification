            I rented a 2000 Mercury Sable recently and I have to say, wow.  This car is amazing.
    The first thing that you notice when you step inside is how roomy it is, like I previously stated in the title, you might confuse this car with a small house.  The interior feels more like a full-size SUV rather than a family sedan, and it was almost intimidating how much room your feet have.  The seats were a bit hard for my tastes, but I'm sure they just needed some breaking in.  The inside is nicely laid out, all of the controls were within reach, and there was a tasteful use of wood trim.  Nothing like a Rolls-Royce, mind you, but it was attractive.  
    The exterior of the car is definitely easy on the eyes, I think that these cars have matured a lot since they were introduced a number of years ago and I feel that now Mercury is really making a world-class car.  There was just enough chrome to not make it look tacky, and the red paint made this car seem very luxurious (which it was).  The engine was very responsive, and it wasn't bad gas mileage either.  I think it is too early in this car's life to remark about reliability, but for all of my needs and purposes it was great.  There was also ample trunk room, enough to hold all of my groceries in paper bags and still fit my breifcase too.  
    Visibility in this car was excellent as well, despite the huge pillars in the back.  The radio was great, it even got in some of my favorite stations from about 90 miles away which is quite an accomplishment.  
    Overall this car is fabulous, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a family sedan with great value, roominess, and all the attractive qualities that I think that this car possesses.  It is quick, relatively easy on the wallet, and I think that it is a wonderful car.  A+<br><br>
