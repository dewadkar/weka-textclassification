            Volvo,
While the predecessor to this model gave techs some brain cramps in the 'what were the engineers thinking' department this newest offering has reaffirmed what only us insiders have been thinking. 
V70- Here is what Volvo is:
1. Primarily interested in market share increase.
2. Building cars that are appealing esthetically with little forethought into lay out and serviceability.
3. A company that regressed as technology progressed.

With regard to my approach here I would like to fill the reader in on my reasoning.  

I have invested 22 years of my life as an Automotive technician and 99% of that experience is with European automobiles.  97,98,99, and 2000 have been with Volvo.  Over the last four years I have earned very high marks from both colleagues and customers.  I have taken a no nonsense approach to remedies for these cars as most of the higher level professionals in Volvo's technical arsenal have blurry vision, no doubt from the 'dark ages' method of training and troubleshooting.  

Coming on line in the technology age should consist of doing more than increasing the advertising budget, or deciding which cultural event to emblazon the Volvo name upon. (Or what about a Volvo XC &quot;Sharper Image&quot; Edition)

  Points to consider from a practical standpoint:

1. Fuel efficiency-poor

2. Mechanical setup of engine/specifically timing belt poor

3. Adjustments of valve train very costly when needed

4. Majority of technical staff that I have had the opportunity to meet or work with showed a common dislike of the new product and very few technicians would own this product.

5. Crash repairs for minor frontal or rear collision are expensive.

6. Unreliable networking systems for on board diagnostics and a high frequency of visits to reset check engine lights.

How is the car now that it has been out for some extended testing?  Not as bad as initially perceived.  That does not allow the conclusion to be positive.  In the short time since writing this opinion I have done more research came up with a few things that may be of interest.

Touchy feely department/esthetics: The new V70 is quieter and smoother than it predecessor and the optional 3rd seat is factory installed and not by some guy at the dealership with a saws-all. The drivers position offers better visibility.  The rear end of the AWD unit is a redesigned assembly that is much smoother than the earlier V70. 

At the shop: The frequency of visits for &quot;Check engine&quot; lights is easing up some and the overall network appears to have a better record thus far.  Previously I had mentioned that there were some quality issues that we were not privy to but we have been informed, by Volvo, that the quality issues deal with things like noisey door stops, vibrations in the right hand side of the dash, squeaks in the rear by the tailgate latch, and some engine roughness.  All but the engine roughness can be easily addressed by some adjustments.  The engine concern is addressed with a software download by application and as I mentioned before that the diagnostics are not too good with this car.

In all the 2001 Volvos I have prepped, as of yet, there have been defects.  I know we are human and not perfect either but when you are playing for the taller dollar crowd, in a field that is lush with offerings that are mobile granite, you need to produce gold.  At some point I am going to make a break through and people from Volvo will start get back to their roots of building cars that function well and are satisfying for generations. 

News from the tech department the latest production run and beyond will feature a neutral overide for when the car is is drive at idle while sitting in traffic.  The benefit will be to keep internal fluid temperatures lower in the transmission.  This feature is selected by the computer and not the driver and will not engage while inclined on a hill and actually will work in opposite by adding pressure through the transmission to eliminate roll back.

I do still hold that for the money there are better vehicles.


Volvo NOYL &quot;Not on your Life&quot; was turned down by the marketing department but is accepted in many BBBs across the land.
