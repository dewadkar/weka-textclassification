             I'm a  40 year old female who just started driving less than 7 months ago, to make a long story short i have always bought my husband new cars and i mean new like in the year and fully loaded.As we speak he is the owner of the 2000 L.H.S.and mind you it was bought in november of 99 he is thrilled with the car.So back to me i wanted my 1st car to be brand new alsoso i said something small that i won't be afraid of, hubbys is like a boat.(LAUGH) I decided on a 2000 ford focus the zts model top of the line well it turned out to be bottome of the pit, nothing but trouble the car was in the shop more than i was in it,so hubby suggested that i go to a chrysler car the sister car to the l.h.s. and that would be the 300m and i was petrified.So on we went to the chrysler dealer the smae place we bought the l.h.s. and said lets see what the 300m is all about, well i took a test drive in the car and i fell in love all over again for the 2nd time in my life. The car is a dream, the handling of course is much diffrent from the l.h.s. of course i choose the 300m stone white with the handling pkg, it comes with chrome wheels and moon roof 4cd changer in side dash changer,with 11 infinity spaeker system, it also has the auto stick, all i can say it goes on and on .As i stated in the begining this should of been my 1st choice.I have had not one one problem with the car, i feel good in it on a bad day.So if you are interested in a car stop buy a chrysler dealer and check it out you won't be sorry.<br><br>
