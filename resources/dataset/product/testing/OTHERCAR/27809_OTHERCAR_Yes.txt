            It took me a long time to decide what to buy.  I choose this because I had the regular ELPH camera (with the APS film).  This camera is very similar to the old one I had (in function).  I went on a skiing trip and took lots of pictures.  The bad thing is I had to get a 64 MB card to go with it right after I bought the camera (the 8MB card that came with it wasn't enough).  It was worth it though.  The pictures were very clear.  It doesn't take pictures very well at night though.  The pictures were fuzzy.  The camera is very sturdy and durable but there is no protective case that comes with it.
