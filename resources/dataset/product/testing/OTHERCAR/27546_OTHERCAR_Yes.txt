            I bought my Cherokee new, and was a little worried at first.  It was the first vehicle I had purchased new like that, and I was extremely paranoid that I would a) have lots of hidden problems with my car, or b) find out it wasn't the vehicle i wanted....I was pleasntly surprised though, this vehicle offers it off...It's actually not too shabby off road, and it's a good sized vehicle for my family (wife and 3 kids..)..  It has plenty of cargo space, and I can use it to take kids to school, pick up groceries, or pack it up and travel to go hit the slopes in CO..  It's very nice to drive, especialy distances, because you sit up higher than in a regular car, so you can see better, yet the Cherokee still drives like a well tuned car...not some clunky truck...basically you have the best of both worlds....On top of that, I had to give up my Mustang when I got married....I wasn't about to take to a &quot;shaggin wagon&quot; and with the Cherokee, I didn't have too....I own a vehicle I love to take out, and be seen in....I admit I miss my Mustang, but I LOVE my Cherokee...<br><br>
