            November 2001 Update:
I broke down in the middle of an intersection!!!  My car's engine was running on only two of the four cylinders!  I had the car towed and repaired (All the electrical parts, plugs, wires, etc...were fried!) This car is just plain rotten.  There is NO quality in this car.  It's like buying a beautiful red apple and having worms on the inside.  The worst part is that Hyundai won't deal with me...since they say cars come with no true guarantee!  Guarantee, no, but a warranty, yes!  A ten year warranty that BARELY eases mind, but it won't cover the lost wages when I have to take off from work, will it?  I am very tired of this vehicle and cannot wait until the day my lease ends.  


January 2001 Update:
Ok...I have a few extra not-so-nice things to say about my car.  I have had my car in the garage six times in the last 10 months that I have had the thing.  They garage made three attempts at fixing the "noise" that I heard in the rear end.  Ends up that one garage told me that everything needed to be lubed up while the next garage found out that there rear bushings (among other things) were defective.  They replaced and repaired everything which came to a whopping $1200.00 (none of which I had to pay since it was under warranty).  The second thing was when I noticed an annoying humming/grinding sound coming from behind my steering wheel.  The garage then told me that the noise was a rock that somehow lodged itself inside my engine.  Needless to say, I actually had a faulty accelerator cable that needed to be replaced.  I still enjoy my car, but it is bittersweet.  I don't know what will go wrong next and I do not like that feeling.  

Following is the original review:

I fell in love with it when I saw one on the highway. I purchased my 2000 Tiburon just 4 months ago and I absolutely love it.  This year the manufacturer changed the front by adding more contour lines...making the car itself more sporty looking. It packs a 4-cylinder engine...but don't let the smaller engine fool you. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is ready to get a little "peppy".   
 
There are only couple things that I would like to change. One being, the placement of the cup holders and some other accessories.  Since the interior is compact, the manufacturer developed a cup holder that "slides" out with the press of a finger: meaning that the face of the stereo is covered when you have something in the cup holder. Also, the button for the cruise control is not attached to the steering wheel at all (it's located on the dashboard)...and after you press it, then you can set the controls by your steering wheel attachments.  This just requires you to take a few more steps to set cruise.  Sounds confusing, I know...but it is little more than an annoyance. 
 
The thing that really sold me on the vehicle, is that Tiburon comes fully loaded.  Leather seats and steering wheel, power sunroof, 100watt stereo system with radio/tape/cd players all there, power windows, locks, etc...so who wouldn't fall in love?  

Since it only comes with two doors, I would not recommend the Tiburon to a family with children due to difficulties getting carseats in and out.  For me, it's absolutely perfect.  I love the looks that I get when people see my car...and since there are only 9000 Tiburons on the US highways...I am one in 9000 very happy people.
