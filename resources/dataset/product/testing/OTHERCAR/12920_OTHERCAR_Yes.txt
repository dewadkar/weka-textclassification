            I bought mine in '95 with 20,000 miles. Now at 108,000 I feel I can do a honest write-up.

The first 100,000 miles all was well. Had only 3 major repairs / maintenance:

The alternator died, front wheel barrings, front breaks. All was covered by warranty expect breaks.

However this past summer (July '00) three motor mounts,  the air conditioner, and some $300+ part that attaches to the air conditioner. Total cost $1,800.

Much to my surprise all the little extras still work: power windows, doors, ...

It does appear to be a little rough on tires. Maintenance is very important in this area!!

My car's background: 75% city miles/25% highway, oil change every 3,000 miles, tune-up every 12 months.<br><br>
