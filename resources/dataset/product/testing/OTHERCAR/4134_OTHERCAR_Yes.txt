            I love legends. Personally i think the 2 door coupes are some of the nices looking cars you can get, especially given their price range. They are not expensive cars at all, yet they run INCREDIBLY well (mine has 177000 miles on it and all it needs is a new oil filter, as well as my mom has one with 150000 miles on it and it purrs like a kitten).  They're tanks. They take speed bumps well, they have a pretty good turning radius, they handle great, they're extremely roomy.  These are some of acura's best cars, they're reliable too.  
Their engine is by all means not small.  I have an 88 two door coupe, manual, and i smoke other cars off the line, it's not even a contest, until you get into the regular sports car sports car, but then those cars aren't nearly as comfortable as the phatty legend.  After about 1990 they got the new body styles, a much more sleek and curvy looking car and in my opinion they are just beautiful, and if you wanna get a car that you can tweak to make it better the legends are, they look absolutely stunning when they're lowered with tinted windows and a nice new exhaust system and some fog lights, good god.  Overall they're just extrememly nice cars that run for an incredible amount of time and still look in style 13 years after they were made.<br><br>
