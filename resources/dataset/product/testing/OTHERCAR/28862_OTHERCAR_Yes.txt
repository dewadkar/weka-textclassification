            Have you ever taken a picture with a camera? Instamatic? SLR? Polaroids with self developing film? Wouldn't it be great if you could take the best of each of the afore mentioned cameras and roll it all into one camera.

 Imagine, a camera anyone could make a decent picture with. Add these parts; point and shoot from the instamatic ( only with a GOOD lens ), through the viewfinder focus ( for close ups or wide angle only ), being able to see your picture in seconds after exposure (through a nifty color LCD screen on the back of the camera ) and drop in film loading...( oops, there's no film to drop in). Instead of the drop in film, you purchase memory flash cards in denominations around 4mb.

 So, you never run out of film, you do not pay to have your pictures developed (you can print them out on your computer's printer or find a handy Kodak kiosk and have them transferred to Kodak Paper ( without having to wait for an hour to have them developed ) there is a charge for this service. When you have taken all the pictures the flash card can hold, pop in another card and take some more, download your new images to your computer or delete images you may not want and start over.

 With automatic shutter and flash, hook ups for external power supply and serial connection. Anyone can be a good photographer with this camera.<br><br>
