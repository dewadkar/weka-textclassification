            The 2000 Celica is the greatest car Toyota has made since the Supra.  It comes in two models, the lower model GT and the higher model GT-S.  The GT is equipped with a 140HP VVTL engine.  Which stands for Variable Valve Timing and Lift.  The GT-S Celica has a 180HP VVTL-i engine which stands for Variable Valve Timing and Lift with Intelligence. Both cars are exceptionally roomy in both the front and rear, especially with the optional leather seats.  Both the GT and GT-S come in standard with manual transmissions.  The GT is 5-speed and the GT-S is 6-speed. I would really recommend this car to anyone that wants speed and luxury in one car.  <br><br>
