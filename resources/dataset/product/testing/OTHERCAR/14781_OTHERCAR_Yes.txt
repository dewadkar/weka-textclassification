            I'm in the Army and when I received orders to return to Germany, I immediately went out to find a car that I knew could handle the rougher driving conditions of the autobahns and not cost me an arm and a leg.  The Clinton years were not kind to us in the military as far as money or really anything else for that matter, but that is another story in itself.
So I spent part of my re-enlistment bonus on this little white '93 Fox, (technically my wife spent part of my bonus on a white '93 Fox, but yet again another unrelated story).
The only things I've had to do to this car the six months I've had it were change the oil a couple of times and a tune up, mainly cause it had been sitting on the used car lot for some time and the plug wires were starting to dry rot and just cause so I would know where the car stood as far as maintence was concerned.  Oh, yeah I had a head light go out after having the car about a month.  The only problems I expect in the future is just having to replace more of the lights as they go out and keeping fresh Valvoline in the engine.
The gas mileage on this car is outstanding.  I'm used to having big cars or sports cars, so a 12 gallon tank of gas lasting for 380 miles just has me floored.  I can't get over it still.  Which I know will help when I get over to Europe and gas is $4 a gallon.
For a small car I couldn't be happier, although I can't wait to get behind the wheel of a Mustang again, or a full sized truck.  I'll just wait patientally until I come back from Germany for I set my sights on one of those again.
