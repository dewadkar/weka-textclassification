            I bought this vehicle for travel. It seemed like a great buy at the time. It had everything you could possible need for comfort. Very roomy,good storage space,top rack,and my favorite, separate A/C and heating for passenger riding in the rear. The first trip was to Chicago. It handled will. Smooth drive, Problem free. Transmission went out when I got back. I have had nothing but trouble since. I have spent close to $5000.00 to fix this problem. I would not suggest buying this vehicle if you want to travel.<br><br>
