            In Feb. of 1997 I purchased a new 1997 Cherokee Sport 4.0L (6-cylinder) 4x4 SUV. It came with power windows and door locks, tinted glass, automatic transmission, cloth seats, cassette deck with single disc CD player, 6 (or 8) speakers, fog lamps, keyless remote for locking and un-locking the vehicle, cruise-control, and the over-head console with on-board computer. It is Emerald Green with Grayish interior.

Within a month of buying the vehicle, the main computer which manages the engine failed leaving us stranded on the highway. Of course, Chrysler's roadside assistance was handy and within 30 minutes a tow-truck appeared to take the vehicle to the dealership. When I learned that the computer had failed due a short in a wiring harness that was pinched when it came from the factory, I raised a stink with Chrysler and the dealership about the fact that electrical circuits which experience high current are often damaged...and fail sooner than they would if the current is keep to within specifications. Well, in order to keep me happy the dealership gave me a Chrysler extended warranty (7 years) from purchase date which covered the engine and most electrical components of the vehicle.

Three months later, we ran out of gas when the fuel indicator indicated that we had 1/2 a tank. We called roadside assistance and during the call learned there was a re-call on the vehicle due to mis-calibration of the fuel gauge which was resulting in folks running out of gas while the fuel indicator showed 1/2 a tank. Again, the dealership repaired the problem with no issues and gave me a coupon to make my next oil-change free.

Then about a year later, the CD player failed. Again, we found that the problem was known to Jeep and they replaced the CD player with no problems.

I have had this Cherokee 4 years now and I think the vehicle is reliable, rugged, and steady. 

Still though there are minor annoyances. The fog lamp switch has been replaced twice. It will work for a while then mysteriously the fog lamps will go out when the switch is engaged. Luckily, the part is covered by the extended warranty I got from Chrysler due to the main computer failure within the first month of ownership.

Other problems include: the cargo area light is supposed to come on when the cargo door is open, well it takes a rather Buddhist approach to its existence and works when it feels like it.

About 6 months ago the keyless remote stopped working and had to be replaced; it coincided with the water-pump failure.

In spite of all of the above though, I like the vehicle. I bought it because I wanted a truck-like vehicle but I did not want a truck - open bed and all that.

The Jeep is very truck-like in its handling. It drives well, but don't expect car-like performance or handling.

This is my first sport-ute, so I like the fact that you sit up high and feel protected in the vehicle. It has a very solid feel to it. But, I suppose one can say that about most SUVs.

The rear-seats are not for full-size adults; the rear door openings are small which makes it a bit challenging for long-legged passengers. Even the front-seat leg room is not all that. So this is definately not a vehicle for tall people. I am 5'10&quot; and find that on long trips my legs feel very cramped. 

The gas milage is OK...I average about 16.8 city and 21 highway. 

The insurance is very reasonable if you have a good driving record. I think full-coverage for me is about $345.00/year.

The engine has never given the slightest problem though I have observed  that at 80mph engine noise is very noticeable.

All in all, I would recommend the Jeep Cherokee Sport to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced SUV and not a status symbol. However, I have just learned that Chrysler is discontinuing the vehicle. Nevertheless, I fully expect to get 10 years (or more) worth of service from my Jeep.

Oh, BTW, I have had my Cherokee off road once (in 4x4 mode) and it did great - but, I am not a serious off-roader and really did not buy the vehicle for that purpose; however, having said that I would not hesitate to do off-roading in this vehicle because I think it is quite capable in that regard and as the Cherokee ages and I am less sensitive scatching it up, I fully expect to do more off-roading.

Just to give some perspective, though I have no plans to trade my Cherokee (it is paid for), I do plan to buy another SUV for daily driving/commuting and use the Cherokee as a fun week-end vehicle. I want a Land Rover Disco II as my primary transportation, but given the reliability issues and high price of Discovery, I have decided to wait. Now that Ford owns Land Rover, I am hoping that it will improve the Land Rover's reliability and maybe re-engineer its dated, small-cylinder V-8 engine with something with more power. It will be interesting to see what becomes of Land Rover. <br><br>
