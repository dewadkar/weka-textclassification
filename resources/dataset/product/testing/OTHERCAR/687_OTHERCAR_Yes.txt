            My wife and I are going on a vacation to Ireland this fall, so we decided to purchase a digital camera to capture some of the memories.  After an enormous amount of research I decided on the Coolpix 950.  
Since our purchase, we have tried to use the camera in every way it was designed for.  At the beginning there was a very steep learning curve because of the great deal of features this camera comes loaded with.  I have used the camera to record images from anything such as photos for my sister-in-law's graphic design classes, dolphins near the beach, family get-togethers, and children's sports events.
The pictures are wonderful, if you don't like one, you can delete it instantly and get one you like.  
There are some drawbacks, however; bring lots of batteries, it will not last an hour with ones that are fully charged.
For this model you will probably want a media card reader with USB connections, your download time will be significantly reduced.
The camera shuts off by itself (after a item delay), so just when you think you have the right picture, you may have to reset it.
The manual is not as in-depth as I feel is warranted for the amount I paid.
