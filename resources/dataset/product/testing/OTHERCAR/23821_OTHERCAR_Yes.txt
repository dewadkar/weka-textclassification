            After debating on which kind of Toyota to get, I decided on the Echo.  A new model this year, I hadn't heard much about it but having had such good luck with a 1980 Toyota Corolla (still running strong, by the way) I knew I would be pleased.  It took one test drive and I was signing the papers that afternoon - I have been the proud owner of a 4-door silver Echo with option package #1, A/C and 6 speaker sound system for 16 days now... and I have loved every minute of it.  I took it on a trip from Seattle to Portland (~180 miles) and only used one whole tank of gas ROUND TRIP!!  That was a strong selling point for me as well - the great gas mileage.  The car is very responsive and it warms up and defrosts quickly.  It also has tons of storage space - it is unbelievably roomy for a &quot;compact&quot; car - and the 60/40 split rear seats has been great for hauling around holiday gifts with ease.  On a scale from 0-100, I give it a 97.  Three points deducted because (1) the coin holder is made in such a way where if you actually have coins in it they make annoying noise, (2) The ash tray does not come out conveniently when you have the car in park and you are getting you coins out of it instead of the coin holder, and (3) all of the staring at my sassy new car from curious passers-by... it is taking some getting used to. :)<br><br>
