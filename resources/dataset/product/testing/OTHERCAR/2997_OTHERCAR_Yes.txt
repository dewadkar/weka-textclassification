            I am only 18 years old, so I have not had as much car buying and selling experience as many other people.  But, I do know this.  My 1990 Dodge Shadow is the best car that anyone in my family has ever had.  

I bought my car about 2 1/2 years ago.  It was my first car, and at only roughly $3800, it was a steal.  It is a manual transmission, 4 cylinders, 2.0 liter and 4 door.  I love it sooo much.  In the small amount of time that I have had my car, I have only had to seriously service it once for an electrical problem.  Other than regular wear and tear, I haven't had to put hardly any money into my car.

Now, it is 10 years old, 133,000 miles, and it still runs like the first day I bought it 2 1/2 years ago.  The only draw back that I have is that there are many minor electrical problems that go wrong with the car that can be easily fixed.  Things like Tail-lights mis-functioning, the flasher for the directionals shorts, a new headlight every 3 months, etc.  But, as far as the mechanics, exterior, and interior go, it is a steal for your money.  If you ever run across a decent looking one, don't worry about the mileage, it makes a perfect first car.

Let me know what your experiences have been, or are!
