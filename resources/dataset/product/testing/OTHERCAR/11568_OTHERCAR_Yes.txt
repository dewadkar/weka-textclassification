            My decision to lease the Cherokee Sport was easy. I had driven a full-size SUV for four years and loved the ride but hated the mileage with a V-8 and the high maintenance and insurance.  The Cherokee was the perfect answer.  Handles well on the road, more like a car than the traditional SUV truck feel.  Has excellent gas mileage for an SUV; even found my car insurance went down by 12% with it!  The only downside to it?  It is a rather noisy, not well insulated SUV.  I find that we notch the stereo up a little to drown out the road noise.  But the extras you get with the Sport make it worthwhile:  heating vents to the rear area, an interior spare, keyless entry, easy access under the hood, and an SUV that a short woman can get into without a ladder.  And, as a short person, I can easily reach everything without stretching -- and that is a major issue in some SUV's.  The other downside is that there is not much leg room in the back seat but, if you are hauling kids back there, it is perfect.  <br><br>
