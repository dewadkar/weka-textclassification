            I bought my 1997 Chevy Astro Minivan in January 1998, just after my youngest daughter left for college.  That left only me and the dog, riding around town in our 'glorified station wagon.'  (my husband has his own vehicle, maybe someday I'll write about it too)  It had been a rental car in Dallas, TX and had 30,000 miles on it.  That's about as new as I get for a liability such as a car and figure being a rental, it's had pretty good care.  

I was pretty picky about what color I wanted, something a car dealer will try to tell you you can't be when buying a used vehicle.  If you aren't in too big a hurry and wait long enough, the one you want will come along.  I like the white, it looks cleaner longer, and it has a light blue interior.  As I mentioned, the dog and I are constant companions and even though I have a blanket for him to lay on, his hair is all over and the color of the interior hides that for a few days until I can get it vacuumed out.  

I love the rear air conditioner, another thing I specified.  It cools the extra space in there much faster than the dash AC does.  One thing I don't like is that the dash AC cuts out when you are on the highway and speed up to pass.  It's some kind of energy saving feature to improve gas mileage but it doesn't impress me very much.  The rear AC keeps blowing strong though and pretty soon the dash AC will come back on.  

Since I don't have a big family to take to school and ball games and the like, lots of folks thought I was nuts for getting such a big vehicle.  I think it drives as good as a smaller car (I used to have a 2-door car), I don't have any trouble parking it downtown or anywhere.  Several times a week there are from 4 to 7 of us who go to lunch together and we always pile into my van.  There is room for everyone to ride comfortably.  My husband and I sometimes take out the back seat and pack the dog and several suitcases (we don't travel light) and go for a week or so road trip.  We are always very comfortable traveling in the van.  

The only time I have had it in the shop in the past two and one half years I have owned this vehicle was for regular maintenance, oil changes, tires rotated and balanced and the like.
