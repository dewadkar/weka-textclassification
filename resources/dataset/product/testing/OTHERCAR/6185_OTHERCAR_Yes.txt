            I have had a six month driving experience with the 1999 Chevrolet Venture mini van.  The vehicle is thus far economical to operate, extremely reliable, comfortable, and practical.  On the open road, this vehicle rides like a larger and heavier van.  There have been none of the usual new vehicle &quot;bugs&quot;, and nothing to return this vehicle to the dealer for service.  Everything works as it is supposed to.  As contrasted with the Toyota van that it replaced, it appears there is more of a built in quality and tightness.  

As the vehicle accumulates mileage, the gas mileage seems to be improving even further.  This vehicle has been used for a number of hauling projects, and after a trip to the lumber company, it is obvious that a full sheet of plywood fits easily inside.  We are very impressed with the quality and value.<br><br>
