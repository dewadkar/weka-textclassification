            The Infiniti I30t is our third Infiniti, and our third on lease with this excellent company.  We leased our first one, an M30, in 1990 when Infiniti first arrived in the States.  We were impressed by so much about both the car and the company, which stresses customer service, that we've leased two more cars with them: in 1995, a J30t (my personal favorite), and in 1998, an I30t.

Much has been said here about the I30 itself.  It is indeed a wonderful luxury car, with a reliable, sprightly V6 engine, all the creature comforts one could want, including CD, Bose sound system, sun/moon roof, leather (heated) seats, a great remote-controlled security system that not only unlocks doors and trunk, but also lowers the windows automatically to release all that &quot;hot air&quot; on a summer day before you even reach the car itself!.  The ride is quiet, the handling responsive, and there is adequate power for hills and passing.  The car has a roomy interior, suitable for family use, with comfortable seats.  The best things of all, to my mind are: 1.  you get all this for about $5,000 less than a comparably equipped Lexus ES300 or Acura 320; 2. the new design for 2000 is beautiful, and 3. all the extras are part of the base price!

Infiniti leases are so advantageous (often with no money down and a very reasonable, negotiable monthly cost) that we will probably lease our FOURTH Infiniti, another I30t (2001 edition) when our current lease runs out in October!  Infiniti lease terms are excellent across the country.  I live in Southern California, and my friend, in Hartford, CT, is leasing his third Infiniti this coming summer.<br><br>
