            The Acura CL Type S is the KING of luxury coupes!  This car has everything standard, and the only option is the navigation system.  The automatic climate control is great and is incredibly simple to use.  Heated seats are also standard and when switched to high mode, you seat will be toasty in no time.  The seats are incredibly comfortable and they seem to wrap around you, like the seats in a sports car.  The Sport Shift is the best manumatic I have ever driven because the shifting motion is very close to a manual and the system will not shift automatically after 2nd gear.  Xenon headlights are also standard and they improve viewing distance at night and look really cool.  The Acura Bose in dash 6 disc CD changer sounds great on 6 well balanced speakers.  All of these features are great, but the heart of this car has to be the 260 hp 6 cylinder engine.  This engine is quick!  With a 0-60 time of just under 7 seconds, this car is fast enough to keep up with a BMW 328ci, even though the Acura is front wheel drive.  I'd say this car was perfect, but Acura could make a few improvements.  If the platform was rear wheel drive instead of front wheel drive, this car would be a lot quicker.  If Acura also offered a 6 or 5 speed manual transmission, they could compete better with the BMW's.  All in all, this car is a quick sport coupe with a lot of power and a low sticker price(compared to the BMW).  So if you're considering buying a luxury sport coupe, look past the BMW dealer, and towards the Acura dealer.<br><br>
