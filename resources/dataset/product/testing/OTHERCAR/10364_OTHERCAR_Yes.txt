After having my '85 Cadillac Deville TWICE stolen from my driveway and subsequently recovered, I was ready for a newer car. Caddy just wasn't the same after those two 
incidents. 

I love the KIA Sephia LS! It wouldn't have been my first choice, but we couldn't afford the car we REALLY want right now. But all in all, the KIA has really been a solid buy for us. We've had this car for about 6 weeks.

We browsed around the used car parking lot for a while, early one morning before the dealership opened. We liked this car! It just seemed right for us. We looked at another KIA that was not in great condition. When we came back during working hours, a few other lookers were interested in the KIA Sephia..so we jumped on the opportunity.

The KIA commercials intrigued us for some reason. That's not why we bought the car, but oddly enough, before we bought the car, our friends did think of us when they heard that commercial.

Pros:
The ride is very smooth. We've owned and rented various models in the past, and knew exactly what we did NOT want. We were concerned that we would hear a lot of road noise - the tire on the pavement etc. But that was not the case. 

While our purchase did not include power features that we were accustomed to, it's comfortable fit, charming exterior, and seating capacity were definite pluses. The seats are roomy and surprisingly comfy.  There's plenty of leg room both in front and back. The interior space and appearance sold us. Other comfort features include a dual cupholder, map pockets, tinted glass and remote releases for the hood, trunk and fuel door.

The 1.8 liter, 16-valve, multi-port, fuel injected power plant cranks out 125 horsepower. That's more than practically any base car in its class that we checked out. 

Cons:

AN FYI I found from SafetyAlerts.com mentions that The National Highway Transportation Administration (NETS) announced the recall of certain Kia Sepia (years 1998 and 1999) because manufacturing changes were made to a valve on the fuel filler pipe assembly that could cause fuel shut off before the tank reached 95 percent of nominal capacity. This could cause customers to add more fuel to the tank causing fuel to spill or spit back from the fuel filler neck. Fuel leakage in the presence of an ignition source can result in a fire. I'm not sure on the status of ours.

The acceleration/pick up is a little slow. It doesn't "get up and go" as I'd like it to, but once it's on the road, it drives fine.

I don't particularly like the placement of the seat adjustments. The lever to move the seat back and forth on the driver's side is just on the bottom right hand side of the seat, near the gear shift unit, making a tight fit to pull the seat back, and I bruised my elbow the first times by pulling back to far looking for the seat lever on the left side. 

The gas and trunk levers are convenient, EXCEPT that they are not power driven. In other words, if someone can get into the car, they can also get into the trunk, hood, and fuel door. Many cars work this way, but I was not used to that. Now I HAVE to lock my car. 

Many reviews that I have come across (including epinions here) and else where tout this car as a lemon. So far we haven't had problems with the used vehicle, but I I will update.
