            I have been wanting a digital camera ever since they first came out but, I just can't afford one just yet.  So, when my daughter graduated this year I borrowed a friends Sony mavica 88.  

Now I know for sure what camera I am saving up for.  This was extremely easy to operate.  It has a big enough screen for viewing that it makes it easy to capture just the shot you want.  The 16 times zoom is awesome.  We were sitting way in the back of the auditorium and the pictures looked like we were right up front.  It also takes beautiful indoors pictures.  With a built in flash.  

The only problems I had was holding my hands steady enough that the items I was trying to photo didn't come out blurred.  It takes a little practice to get used to how to push the button without moving the camera.  It takes standard high density floppy disks which is real convenient as you don't have to plug the camera into your computer or have special software just for the camera.  It depends on how you set up the camera as to how many pictures you can get on a disk.  I kept it on the standard setting and got 7 pictures on a disk.  This is another draw back to this type of camera.  If you are going to  be taking a lot of pictures you will need a lot of disks.  

When I did the pictures on the computer I was very pleased with how they turned out.  I purchased the HP Photo ink cartridge and some photo paper and you would never know that they weren't professionally done.  This camera also comes with two batteries and a recharger.  Each battery lasts about 1 1/2 hours.  All in all this is a great camera.  I can't wait until I get one of my own.<br><br>
