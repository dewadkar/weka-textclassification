The all-new Acura Integra, or 2002 Acura RSX, provides a <i>radioactive sport experience</i>. The styling is sporty, the engine is rev-happy, the seats hold you in place, the gages are devilishly red at night, and the ride... definitely sport!

My brother recently acquired a brand new RSX for his 19th birthday (our parents gave it to him). Ahh! The benefits of making into one of the best universities in the nation: University of California in Berkeley. Of course, one also needs some <i>cash</i> to buy one of these RSXs, and the RSX is no cheap coupe. Read my findings of this <i>college investment</i> through its first 2,000 miles below.

<b>The Neat Stuff</b>

The RSX is a neat little <b>sport</b> car. The 160 hp engine thrusts the car forward <b>and you</b> into the seat! Fortunately, the seats are tough and hold you in place on most maneuvers. The tachometer shows just how happy the car gets, with every throw of the shift (manual transmission), the number of revolutions easily top over 5,000 -- and the car is always asking for more. The redline starts at 6,900 RPM. Mileage is surprisingly good at over 30 mpg (highway), yet I?m not sure what the city mpg will be for this car. I will keep you updated!

Meanwhile, the RSX behaves like a true sports car on the road. The Michelin tires work simultaneously with the tough suspension to ensure good and tight maneuvering. Handling is easy and the ride controlled, though one should expect a rough ride in bad asphalt. Noise is not so much a concern as other <i>opinionates</i> suggested, though the engine is very loud at mid to high RPMs; which are impossible to prevent.

With so much performance, one must ask, "How are the brakes?" They are great! Standard four-wheel disk and ABS provide plenty of braking power in rough situations. Note that I have not made use of the ABS system in any emergencies up to-date.

Inside the vehicle, gages are well placed, with cruise control switches located on the letter-wrapped steering wheel. Red lighting runs throughout the cabin, including a LED strategically placed over the cup holders and a compartment located inside the lid for the cup holders. By fault of some random engineer, or pure weirdness, neither doors' buttons (windows and lock buttons) are illuminated. Cruise control switches are not illuminated, either.

To complete the package, Acura included bright white halogen lights for headlamps -- which are just recently making way into the American market -- and a CD player as standard equipment. The sound from the stock radio, however, is downright weak with virtually no bass. Leather finishes the seats, though this is no Audi or BMW leather...

Observation: I drive a car with an automatic transmission, and while driving this RSX with a manual 5-gear transmission, the engine did not die even once -- proving to be very easy to adjust to (or I was very lucky!).

<b>Danger: radioactive equipment</b>

The RSX is a neat <b>little</b> sport car.

Just one weak before my brother purchased his RSX, my mom saw a Celica (Toyota's equivalent little sport car) under the back of a truck; which calls attention to the fact that small <i>and light</i> cars do not do well in crashes.

What is my point? Much like the "clean" nuclear power that powers our lights, anything that is radioactive has drawbacks. And the RSX has several of them.

Lets start with the rear seat -- my main complaint (read why next). During the test drive, my brother fumbled a shift and the car <b>jumped</b>, literally throwing my head into the car's ceiling and the rear window -- giving me much pain. I am only 5'8 and the rear seat is way too low for even me! I must tell you, the RSX's rear seats are better for dogs than people. In addition, the seats only fit two, do not have head rests, and are as hard as plastic. The only benefit is that they fold down!

Dogs I tell you, not people.

Next, the suspension is extremely hard. I drive a VW Jetta and the ride is much better in my car. Now, wait! Before you say the RSX is a different car, let me tell you how bad the ride is: my own brother, who loves the car, drove to San Francisco from San Diego (eight hours) and back, last week. This week, my mom asked him about his plans for Thanksgiving (if he is coming down), and he says he is flying. When she asked why, he replied, "You want me to drive here in THAT car?" <b>PROOF</b>, that the ride in this car is intolerable -- as even the owner says it is, but refuses to admit.

Dogs I tell you, not people! ;o)

To finish off the car, the front seats are also very hard. The headrests are a fixed part of the seat and have no adjustment. It took me one month to negotiate the tough seats in my Jetta. The RSX's are impossible.

And no lights on the doors, what is up with this people? One would expect more from a $20,000 car! At least I do.


*** If you had a brand new car, wouldn't you rather drive it for 500 miles and test out its limits rather than fly? ***

** Wake up call! (9/15/02) **

I must warn people considering this car regarding parts: they are EXTREMELY expensive. My brother crashed his car 1 1/2 weeks later after purchase into the side of a Civic moving at 5-10 mph (the Civic was doing 25-30 mph), as he was leaving a stop sign. The result: a $9,000 bill! And that's just for the front bumper, headlights assembly and some body work (no engine damage). Amount for damage to the Civic is still unknown.

The RSX is a cute car, but nothing more than an expensive toy. I don't recommend it, unless all you want is a toy.
