            I've had my '00 Odyssey EX for about a month now. Overall, I'd have to say it's been very satisfying. I tried hard not to buy one because of the snobby, greedy dealer attitude that seems to surround this highly sought after minivan. You know, the &quot;waiting list&quot;, additional dealer markup ($2,000-3,000 that I saw), needless and heavily marked up add ons ($300-500 cassette player, $300-500 roof rack cross members, $400-500 wheel well protectors?, $200-300 floor mats, $1,800-2,000 after market leather, etc., etc.). But after much negotiation (and a couple a complaining calls to Honda North America about sleazy dealer tactics) I was able to get mine just over MSRP. Now, I have 4-5 friends that are trying to get one after checking out mine. It really is that far ahead of the other available mini vans. Not that it is perfect, just that it does more things better than rest. How long it holds up is something I'm trusting to the &quot;Honda Reputation&quot; that so many people talk about.

The Good 

1. Handling - very &quot;crisp&quot; (for a van), probably a little stiff for American made minivan fans, but great if you appreciate a &quot;European&quot; type road feel

2. Power - once again, very good for a minivan - the most horsepower in its class and it shows.

3. Comfort/Convenience - fair to good - some of the controls could have been better thought out (the shift knob blocks your view of  some of the radio controls, but those same controls are on the steering wheel, and I don't like the  &quot;do everything&quot; type levers they put on the steering column) - the seats are not the most comfortable I've ever been in, but if you sit up straight (like mother told you) you'll be fine. As far as the automatic power doors are concerned, some people have complained about how they are too slow, too dangerous (don't stop easily when obstructed), and confusing to operate. All true, but aren't regular sliding doors difficult to close (you have to almost &quot;slam&quot; them shut), dangerous (smashed fingers and bumped heads), and easy to get things caught in? Finally, the disappearing third row seat is genius. I'm embarrassed that an American carmaker couldn't have come up with this idea years ago.

4. Fit/Finish - It's a Honda. I was not aware how solid these vehicles were until I bought mine. My wife drives a Mercedes E320 and it really does compare favorably in this department. No rattles, tight ride, great sound when closing doors, etc.<br><br>
