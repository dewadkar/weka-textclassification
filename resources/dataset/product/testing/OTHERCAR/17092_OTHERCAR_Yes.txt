            Last January while we were on vacation, my wife and I stopped in Alabama and toured the Mercedes plant.  We were so impressed with the quality and safety features of the ML 320 that we decided to test drive one when we got home.  The test drive was wonderful and the price wasn't so bad considering that it was a Mercedes, so we purchased it.  It does have a few missing features, but makes up for it in so many other ways.  It is a great driving vehicle, very responsive in steering, braking, and acceleration.  It went through five inches of new wet snow in Chicago like it wasn't there.  Ten inches of water in Iowa didn't brother it.  On a 7,000 miles trip to California on the interstate highways at mostly 80 miles an hour it got 20.9 miles per gallon.  That included a lot stop and go miles in LA and San Francisco.  I have never put miles on a vehicle so fast.  Our other cars sure are doing a lot of sitting around because everyone in the family wants to go in the ML 320.  It has all advantages of a SUV and the ride of a car.  Our only question is, will it last like the other Mercedes.<br><br>
