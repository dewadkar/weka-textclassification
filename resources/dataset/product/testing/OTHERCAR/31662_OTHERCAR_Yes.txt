            I wanted to get the G35 Sedan (Luxury Leather) to replace my <b><a href="/content_57931697796">Mitsubishi Galant</a></b> for a while, but was waiting for the 2004 model. You see, I try not to buy the new model cars the first year they are released.

The wait paid off in several areas. Firstly, the 2004 model (I am talking about the Luxury Leather Auto) has heated seats and outside mirrors and tire pressure monitoring as standard equipment (unlike the <b><a href="/content_74023669380">2003 model</a></b>) and also features an updated 6-disc CD changer with faster operation. Also, the car has a power passenger seat now as standard equipment.

Secondly, the price went up only $450. And I was able to get the car for only $500 over invoice price, which would be impossible a year earlier. I got my car in September, at which time the CarsDirect.com listed the 2003 model at the same price I got my 2004 model for.

<b>Buying</b>

I have to mention that getting the car without sunroof, premium package, Bose sound system and the like is very difficult. I was barely able to locate <b>one</b> G35 with no sunroof and other options in Southern California using Infiniti&#146s web site when I was ready to buy. Even that car had a trunk mat and mud guards.

I am not a big fan of sunroofs. I don&#146t like them, don&#146t feel like paying $900 for one and like extra headroom space the lack of sunroof entails. And I didn&#146t want the Bose sound system either, because it has artificially high levels of bass and mid-treble, producing unnatural sound for another $900 or so.

I wouldn&#146t mind paying for navigation system, but to get it, you have to get the Premium Package for $2200 (including useless for me reclining rear seats) and sunroof.

<b>More Info</b>

The G35 Sedan is a rear-wheel drive car with a 3.5-liter V6 engine, which produces 260 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque (the coupe produces 280 hp and looks better, but it is smaller and more expensive). The power in the model I got (Auto) is routed through the 5-speed automatic transmission to the rear wheels.

The car features 52/48 weight distribution front to rear and has aluminum suspension components. The standard-issue G35 has zero-lift front aerodynamics and feels very stable at high speeds. It also features LED stoplights, which illuminate faster and last longer than conventional lights.

The front features HID xenon headlights (low beam) and I was a little surprised to find that the windshield washer jets are not located on the hood and provide clean hood look.

The brakes have electronic force distribution, ABS, vehicle dynamic control and brake assist. The G35 has front, side and head-curtain airbags as well as active head restraints (they move forward in rear-end collisions preventing whiplash).

You can get more information elsewhere, but I just have to say that I believe I got a great bargain: the interior space of a BMW 530 with more power for the price of the stripped BMW 325. Of course, there are other variables involved, even aside from the BMW&#146s legendary handling and BMW free maintenance. But I am happy with the deal I got.

<b>Impressions</b>

I currently have a bit less than 1,000 miles on the car and can already see the good, the bad and the ugly of it (or at least the most of it).

<b>Not Good</b>

First, the standard-issue audio system should have been better (and the Bose is not much better either). Both the Bose-equipped cars and non-Bose cars use the same head unit made by Clarion. I am unsure if it is to blame or the antenna, but the reception could have been better. It is worse than my <b><a href="/content_57931697796">Galant</a></b>'s (even though both use the in-rear-window antenna), and definitely worse than the mast antenna on Volvo S40.

The speakers lacked depth and imaging when the car was new, but the situation improved somewhat with the break-in. They are still no match for the <b><a href="/content_92039122564">Athena</a></b> speakers I have at home, and even speakers in my girlfriend's S40.

Next, the dashboard and the Infiniti signature analog clock reflect into my eyes through the windshield at night, even with the backlight dialed way down. It is not a terrible flaw, but it is just ridiculous how they missed it.

Also, although I have no problem with the way the power seat controls work (4 separate rocker switches), their location is not smart (inboard seat cushions). I would fear using front cup holders for the fear of spilling drinks on them and rendering them unusable.

And did I mention that I hate foot parking brakes? The G35 auto has one. And the car gets about 19 MPG so far. But I am willing to pay for the performance I get and the cars tend to consume more gas during the break-in period.

<b>Interior</b>

The car is roomy inside and I find the seat very comfortable, due in part to the adjustable lumbar support. There is plenty of leg room up front and in the back seat. The wheel tilts with the instrument cluster &#150 a feature I don&#146t mind but don&#146t care much about (it would be better if they made the instruments not reflect from the windshield at night).

The car has an automatic climate control, which is easy to use, but does not allow you to have full control in manual mode as far as the combination of the air distribution direction goes. 

It works well in auto mode, however, aside from its propensity to engage at the maximum fan speed when you start the car on a hot day, creating hair-raising winds inside the cabin. 

The display in the middle of the dash has an electronic compass, climate control display and the outside temperature gauge. Below it, there is a signature Infiniti analog clock. There is a cigarette lighter and 2 power outlets (one of which is in the armrest compartment).

Some car magazines complained about the climate control buttons that are located in a way that makes them difficult to use. I have no problem using them, aside from the fact that you have to look at them while adjusting the temperature or the direction of the air.

And the audio control buttons on the steering wheel make it easy to control the CD playback or radio without even looking.

The aforementioned display for the compass and climate control lets you see the contacts/patterns for the letters/pictograms when the sun light hits the car from the rear.

I got the Graphite (black) interior with titanium accents. I like it &#150 it is not up to VW/Audi or BMW levels of finish, but it is clean and functional. The sun visors feel very cheap though. They have the weight and surface of a thick eraser-rubbed cardboard. But they are also functional, having sun visor extensions and illuminated vanity mirrors.

The steering wheel is convenient and has buttons for cruise control as well as for audio control functions. The back seat does not fold, but has a pass-through with an arm rest for the back passengers, which doubles as the cup holders and a first aid compartment.

The pedals are well-spaced. The interior has several storage compartments: center armrest compartment, 2 little glove boxes (one taken by DVD-based navigation system if so equipped), the compartment in the center top of the dash (taken by the LCD screen for navigation system if so equipped).

The sunglass storage compartment on the headliner is too small to hold 2 of my sunglasses.

<b>Exterior</b>

The standard 17-inch aluminum wheels come with an anti-theft bolts and are fitted with 215mm V-rated Bridgestone Turanza EL42 tires (the sports package equipped cars get W-rated tires of the same size).

I already mentioned the windshield washers located on the wiper arms. The outside power heated mirrors can be folded.

I must admit that I didn&#146t really like the car&#146s interior when it was released some 2 years ago, but now I like it a lot, even the rear styling.

<b>Trunk</b>

The trunk is roomy and has a cargo net. The opening is quite large and the trunk lid has gas-charged struts. The trunk can be opened from the cabin or by pressing a button on the remote. The trunk lid has a handle on the inside to close the lid without having to touch the outside (possibly dirty) surface, as well as the glowing-in-the-dark release handle.

<b>Handling</b>

The main reason I got this car (aside from the price) is its acceleration, braking and handling.

During the test drive before I bought my car, I could accelerate at full throttle <b>entering</b> a 90-degree turn and the VDC (vehicle dynamic control) kept the car on course by braking individual wheels and restricting engine power. 

I don&#146t do stuff like that with my own car &#150 brake pads and rotors are not cheap, but it is good to know that if some situation arises when I need this functionality, it will be there. I am intending to keep the VDC on, even though there is an &#147off&#148 switch &#150 the car power-oversteers with the VDC off.

In fact, 2 months after I got the car, I discovered it oversteers even with the <b>VDC on</b>, although briefly. I was making a very late left turn (the left-turn arrow was about to turn red) in my usual fashion - late braking and acceleration out of the turn. During the acceleration, the tail started sliding wide until I and VDC put it back in place - I scary moment, which indicates that the car is not as balanced as, say, BMW 3-series (I went to the performance driving class, where the 330i never exhibited this kind of behavior). 

Maybe it needs wider and grippier tires, because the 215 mm all-season Turanza EL42 is no match for wider Michelin Pilot Sport.

The car is has rear-wheel drive, which was a requirement for me. Sure, you can get the Infiniti I35 (with the same, but slightly detuned engine and 4-speed automatic) with more standard equipment and standard Bose sound system and wood trim for thousands less. But it, being a front-driver, torque-steers, is slow exiting turns while spinning its front wheels and brakes worse because of the front-biased weight distribution. Plus, its structure is not as solid as the G35&#146s.

The G35 does feel solid. It also (in my non-sport trim) has reasonably compliant suspension. And it corners and brakes quite flat.

<b>Brakes</b>

Some car magazines complained about overly sensitive brake pedal. I don&#146t find it to be overly sensitive, unlike the Porsche Cayenne I drove recently. The brakes are easy to modulate and they provide impressive stopping power.

I have heard form other owners about the brake pads and rotors lasting, in some cases, only 15K miles. Infiniti responded recently (November 2003) by offering free brake service (pads and rotors) for 3 years/30,000 miles.

<b>Transmission</b>

The 5-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly and does not hesitate to downshift, however its manu-matic functionality is limited. It does work well if you want to downshift, but you cannot make it upshift if you want. Floor the throttle and it will downshift anyway, even if you don&#146t want it.

Basically, it is not even manual control of the gear itself, but the manual selection of the allowed range of the transmission operation. Slide the lever to the right while driving on the street at about 40 mph and the digit 4 illuminates on the display. It doesn&#146t mean the car is in 4th gear, but that the transmission is allowed to shift as it pleases within 1-4 gear range.

Move the lever down and release it and the 3 illuminates. Now the transmission is limited to only 3 gears. Works well for driving in the mountains or to slow the car down driving downhill without using brakes for extended periods of time. But my <b><a href="/content_57931697796">Mitsubishi Galant</a></b> has the same functionality sans fancy way to engage it and without bragging about it.

On the other hand, most other implementation of manumatic control by other manufacturers are no better. And the G35&#146s transmission works well enough in the full auto mode. Plus, the car is available with the 6-speed manual transmission. I would probably have gotten it if I haven&#146t had to deal with crappy LA traffic.

<b>Maintenance</b>

Unlike BMW, Mercedes, Volvo or Audi, which provide you with free scheduled maintenance for 3-4 years, you have to pay for your with Infiniti. BMW and Mercedes cars have flexible service system which tells you when to change the oil (on average 15,000 miles). 

The G35 has 3 service schedules, with driving in ideal conditions requiring oil changes every 7,500 miles. Two other schedules &#150 preferred (for people who are paranoid or have OCD) and severe (for all others) &#150 require oil changes every 3,000 miles.

I am sticking with severe service schedule and going to change the oil every 3,000 miles. The manual explicitly states that Infiniti recommends mineral-based oils. Strange, but I will probably follow this recommendation, even though I like synthetic Mobil 1 oil.

At least the oil changes don&#146t cost as much as the oil change at BMW (after the free maintenance period is over). A friend of mine was quoted $250 for an oil change on his BMW 330Ci after the end of the free maintenance period. He did it himself for less than $100 using an oil extractor.

<b>Update:</b> I got a letter from Infiniti yesterday stating that they are aware of the brake pads and rotors wearing fast on the G35 sedans and non-manual coupes and will be providing them free of charge for 3 years/30,000 miles.

<b>Fuel</b>

The manual recommends Premium 91-octane, but permits operation on Regular 87. I am sticking with the Premium. The fuel tank holds 20 gallons.

<b>Bottom Line</b>

I am happy with my G35 so far. It is inexpensive even comparing to the smaller and slower BMW 330, Audi A4 3.0, Mercedes C320 and Lexus IS300. It handles well and has good warranty. Even the small aforementioned annoyances it has (stereo, windshield reflections, etc.) would not stop my from buying it again and recommending to others.
