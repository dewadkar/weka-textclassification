            I have owned my 1995 Chrysler Sebring LXI for nearly two years and have had no problems whatsoever.  The closest I've came to a problem was when it was recalled, but that was just a matter of a few hours of labor.  The Sebring receives excellent gas mileage.  The car can fit up to five people comfortably, and six people at its maximum.  It also has a lot of trunk room for your luggage, speakers, etc.  The Sebring has, it seems like, an endless amount of options.  It has power windows, power locks, air conditioning, and not to mention overall power with a V6 installed.  My car is an automatic, but they also are made with a stick.  If you listen to music often on the road, it comes with an Infinity CD player with infinity speakers which include two 6x9 and two 3x5 front and rear speakers.  The car rides extremely smooth on both the highway and in the city.  It does include airbags to enhance your safety.  It is equipped with cruise control with several options just behind itself.  The seats are comfortable and the leg room in the front and in the back is fit for almost anyone.  Above all, you feel like a million bucks while riding the streets because of the cars outside looks.  This sporty two door will catch the attention of every walker or driver on the streets.  I used to own a 1989 Ford Probe, and I would not trade my Sebring for a thousand of that piece of junk.  I was very impressed from day one with all of the capabilities I encountered when I first stepped into my Chrysler Sebring.  You should not pass up a free test drive.  I am sure you will not be disappointed.<br><br>
