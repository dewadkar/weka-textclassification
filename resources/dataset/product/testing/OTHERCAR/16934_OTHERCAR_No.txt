            In a few years no-one will be buying Subaru's is this is how their quality is going...

When Subaru designed my '99 Subaru Legacy Brighton Wagon SE (5spd manual) they were really having a bad day, or maybe they only took one day to design it !! I thought I was buying a car that would last me 10 years going by reliability reports, finally sold the heap of scrap last week, I pity the person who bought it, but he did get his mechanic to check it. Here is my story - within first few thousand k car was pulling to right, also clutch was juddering from new. I told Subaru of Mississauga about both, they said clutch was wearing in and there was no reason it should be pulling. After a couple of services I got fed up of them and switched to Subaru of Oakville, they diagnosed warped rear right brake drum and machined it, car stopped pulling right, but I had done 18,000k on tires with it already pulling. Continued to complain about clutch but was told that now it was out of warranty and if it got worse, it was covered to 100,000 anyway, about this time 'hesitation on acceleration' really started to get bad, but was OK after services (when they reset the computer). At 46,000 I had to replace all four tires due to uneven wear - caused by original brake drum problem. Finally at 80,000k and two years of fighting with Subaru, Subaru of Oakville hired a new service manager who was very helpful and actually listened to me. He fought Subaru on my behalf and I got a new ECU (engine control unit) to solve the hesitation problem, and new clutch, and they machined the flywheel which was now warped. Subaru tried to get me to pay for the clutch plate as they said they weren't responsible for friction material but I told them that I had never worn out a clutch in 17 years of driving manual cars and it was only worn due to the judder problem, so they ended up paying for all of it. They said that it was a bad batch batch of clutches with weak springs which caused them to bounce instead of clamping properly. At 94,000k the clutch started to judder again, back to Subaru of Oakville, they dismantled the transmission and found that the transmission case was worn and part of the drive was not aligned. This time they replaced clutch, flywheel, transmission case and rebuilt the lot. At 95,000 I was at Home Depot on a Saturday afternoon and reversed diagonally out of a parking space and then put the car into first to drive away, the car kept going backwards, it was stuck in gear. I called CAA and had to wait for four hours for all the people around to go home - while we blocked spaces around us with shopping carts when people left - when enough space was cleared the tow truck could take us away. Back to Subaru of Oakville where they said that they must have adjusted something wrong !*&#& when they rebuilt the transmission, so they rebuilt it again. At this point I took out an extended Superior Lubrico warranty for 3yrs/60,000k extra to kick in at 100,000k and including all electrical and all gadgets, this cost CAD$2,400. At 104,000 my check engine light came on, this was the oxygen sensor. No problem covered by warranty right - wrong, I though all mechanica/electrical needed to keep the thing running was covered. They said, 'Where does it say on the warranty that sensors are covered?' &*&#$#% cost me $400. By now the clutch was juddering again and the transmission is louder in third gear. I bought a 1989 Toyota Corolla 4wd Wagon and that day OPSEU (goverment workers in Ontario went on strike) went on strike so I couldn't sell the Subaru, I parked the Subaru as that way nothing could go wrong. Finally sold it last week, after the strike ended, due to selling after only three years I lost a lot of money on this. PS the 1989 Corolla has had two oil changes 6,000k and no visits to any repair shops, I know which manufacturer I am sticking with from now on. Good luck if you are buying a new Subaru, you will need it. PPS Subaru Oakville are no longer Subaru, they got fed up of fighting with Subaru too.

I just realized that I completely forgot to talk about the warped front brake discs, causing whole car to shake, I put up with that for 50k. They were replaced at 96,000 and they were just starting to warp again, when I parked it. I knew if I drove much further they would get bad and then I wouldn't be able to sell it.
