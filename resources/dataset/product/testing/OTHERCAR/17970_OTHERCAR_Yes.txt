                Oh yeah boy, you know you like it! Whenever someone stops nest to your humble little mini-van driving a Jeep Wrangler Sahara with the roof down, doors off, music blasting and looks over at you through their Oaklies sun reflecting off them, you think to yourself, &quot;Why aren't I that guy?&quot;. 

    The Jeep Wrangler is an awesome car that your kids will love, especially teens, and you can drive around looking cool. The only bad thing about this car is that its not very practical for families and has limited space. I would recommend this car for the father of a family with teens, that way the teens can drive and you can share. I would also recommend this car for a new couple or a bachelor. Have fun and drive safetly. Remember: Friends don't let friends drive drunk!  <br><br>
