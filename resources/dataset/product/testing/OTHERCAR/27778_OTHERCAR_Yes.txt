            If you put a credit card against this camera, you will find out that Digital Elph IS the size of a credit card (just a bit thicker). 
The camera is built like a tank-it's stainless body feels solid and durable-the camera is meant to be taken along wherever you go. And I do take it wherever I go because of its tiny size. When I take it to a party, people keep staring at it because of its size and the quality of the pictures that it takes. Of course, it is a 2 megapixel camera, but  it is more that sufficient for an amateur photographer. We do want the best, the newest, the most expensive, but when weighing out all pros and cons, this camera will serve you well for quite some time. The 3 megapixel cameras are too overpriced and won't be as widely spread as 2 MP for quite some time (a year or two). 

Instead of listing all the features of the camera, let me do the usual thing-10 absolutely subjective observations:
1. It takes three resolution pictures so that you can choose what you want-high quality big, regular quality big, or regular quality small pictures. The highest quality is about 800-900 K, medium size is about 300-500 K, and the small is under 100 K so when shopping for a Compactflash card, plan accordingly. I got two 64 MB cards so that I would not be caught cold without film. Ever!
2. The LCD is bright and clear, makes it easy to preview the pictures.
3. The battery life is not as long as I thought it would be-30-40 shots with LCD on. You need to buy another battery though because once it goes dead, you are out of luck-you won't be able to buy it at any Seven Eleven-S100 uses a proprietary battery which is not cheap, by the way (50 bucks).
4. The compactflash card is rather small (8 MB) so you need to get a bigger one (48 or 64 MB). As I said, I got two 64 MB.
5. The camera has only USB connectors for downloading pictures to your computer. No serial ports.
6. S100 has only NTSC video out, meaning that it will not work on most European TV's-in case you are traveling and want to show off your pictures on a TV screen.
7. The charger that is included (kudos to Canon) is light, compact, and 110-220 V compatible. Nice!
8. The controls are a bit confusing at first, but once you master them, setting controls will be a snap. You will probably need to take 20-30 pictures of various objects in different light conditions to come up with the best setting for your camera.
9. Flash can be a bit too bright-you need to adjust light compensation. The white balance has to be adjusted, also. I went skiing and snow looked blue on many pictures. Should have made adjustments...
10. Did I mention the size?

The camera is a good buy for the money. It offers no big thrills but you will always be tempted to take a snapshot with it. But this is a point of photography-what good does a $1000.00 camera do if you don't take pictures with it?
