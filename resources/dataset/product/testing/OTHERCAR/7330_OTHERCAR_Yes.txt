            Though not a Mazda Miata (which is a little more fun to drive - you get to thrash it around the track more), the 2001 Toyota MR2 Spyder comes pretty close!

Test driven at a dealership (great sales person, who let me thrash the car as long as his boss doesn't see us), I was allowed to have a lead foot, which also allowed the mid-engine to propelled this RWD roadster so fast, I think my hair blew off!  Hey, I don't wear a tupee, mind you!  Acceleration is something not to write home about, but to call, email, and shout about!

Shifts are short-throwing fun, as they are precicse!  I have never felt this comfortable driving a differnt stick-shift car, but the MR2 made me felt at home!  It definately have NO sticky or rubbery feel most people complain about!  The clutch was typical hydralic-type soft clutch feel, but is very responsive.

Handling is just as good!  As I entered the ramp to the freeway, which curves, the sales person told me to stay at 45 MPH and not let go.  I was like "why?" and started to flinch, instinctively disengaging the clutch, allowing the car to coast CAREFULLY...but still around 40 MPG.  As I entered the curve, I understood... I felt NOTHING.  This gave me the confidence to gun it up to 60 as we exited the curve, and had to brake pretty hard....thanks to the driver of a Dodge Caravan.  But, that's alright...on the freeway, I blew past him and a few others before we had to exit and backtrack to the dealership.

Being such a small car, it was quick and nimble, and reminded me of my small (and not-so-fast) Tercel.  Both of which have that certian nimbleness only a small car naturally have.

Of course, before we took the car out, we put the top down.  And this couldn't be easier!  Just unlatch the two laches on both the driver and passenger side, push it down into it's storage compartment, and make sure that it just clicks into place.  Putting it back up when you are down from the speed high is just as easy, as all you do is just the reverse!  It's quick and easy, no-frills - unlike many electrical tops.

Only thing that kinda makes me weary of this car is that there are no roll bars.  This bar is located usually just behind the occupant's seats, which holds up a great beating if the car does flip over which protects the car's occupants.  With this missing from the MR2, any smart driver will know that it is dangerous!  To qoute from the salesperson "the MR2 is a pretty wide car, so there will be no risk of it overturning".  Hmm...isn't that's what they say about their SUVs, too?

In all, this is a fun car to drive.  Though the safety conscience in me won't buy a soft-top convertable especially with no roll bars, I would be missing the speed high if I don't.  Oh well.  :)
