            I have a 95 Cadillac Deville and boy oh boy do I love it.  It is luxury at it's best.  My Deville is a 4 door sedan with a dark cherry exterior and a cappuccino cream colored interior.  The seats are leather and even though I bought it used,it still has that new car smell.  

I'm so glad that I don't have to roll up windows anymore, it feels pretty nice having power windows and locks and how spoiled I've become with the keyless entry remote, I'm so use to unlocking one and  reaching around the whole car to open the others.  I'm also getting quite use to the power recliners both driver and passenger sides, of course two more buttons take care of that.  You can become quite lazy in this car, with everything being just a fingertip away. The illuminated vanity mirrors are nice especially for making sure you look good driving around town.


This car has so much room it's unbelievable.  I have two small children and if they misbehave they know they can get away with it until we get out of the car because there is no way I can reach them from the front.  They may as well be in the trunk, they seem to be miles away.  My dad who is over 6ft and has a problem with his knee, has always had a problem getting comfortable in our vehicles, not this one, he has plenty of leg room.

There are so many other amenities to this car such as electronic climate control with digital display,front and rear armrests, dual cup holders in front and back, dual airbags,tracking, digital dashboard features,anti lock brakes and much,much more.

How's the driving you ask, you feel like your floating, it rides so smoothly, you can't hear the car running, I've had people say, &quot;did you start it up&quot;, you don't feel the bumps in the road, and a lot of outside noise goes unheard.  Highway driving will have your passengers asleep in no time at all.

The only thing that is going to take some unwanted getting use to, is the premium fuel.  Not enjoying that too much
(see epinion on Premium vs. Regular Gasoline.<a href='/auto-review-4F77-6AB06DB-39244391-prod1'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-4F77-6AB06DB-39244391-prod1</a>)


There are so many positive and wonderful things about this car that I cannot possibly name them all.  My husband and I felt that we have made a wise investment in this one.  We look pretty good in it too.

I have discovered that there is a reason why people love Cadillac so much, it really is The car of cars.
