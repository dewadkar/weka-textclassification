            I had the opportunity to drive a brand new Dodge Stratus this past weekend (rental car).  Unfortunately, the car did not meet my expectations...

Positives:
+ This car is beautiful inside...especially in comparison to its American brethren...the leather seats are incredibly comfortable and the console and dash features are well laid out....
+ The autostick feature is a blast...this is a definite winner and made the ride, dare I say, fun...simple but yet effective....
+ The rear seats are ample and the trunk extremely roomy...survived a two cart load Costco shopping excursion with room to spare...
+ The instrument panel has a nice backlighting...gives the car a more luxurious feel...

Negatives:
- The braking was surprisingly poor...the stopping distance required was far in excess of similar cars that I have driven
- The handling, even allowing for the fact that this is a larger car, was not as responsive as I would have liked...
- The engine, despite sounding powerful on paper, suffered from poor acceleration...it lacked the &quot;oomph&quot; I would have expected from an engine of its size (poor torque)...

BOTTOM LINE:
A nice car and an excellent effort from Dodge...definitely a step in the right direction...however, for about the same amount of money, I would recommend the Camry or Accord.  If you have a bit more to spend, the Passat is a fantastic vehicle to own...
