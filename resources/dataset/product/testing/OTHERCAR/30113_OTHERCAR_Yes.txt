            I bought my 95 Stratus new and have kept up on it's maintenance religiously.  I have 138,000 miles and it still runs as well as the day I bought it.  It handles well, has tight steering, and besides normal maintenance hasn't presented any major problems.  I got every bell and whistle available and it is a comfortable ride.  Roomy and convenient.  I have the factory installed CD player and the sound system is excellent, better than almost all other cars I've been in. The body is still in great shape and when I wash it people tell me it looks brand new.  (Handwashing helps keep the finish)

The only drawbacks are minor.  My biggest complaint is that the headlights are weak, but I have the ES model and usually drive with the fog lights on to make up for it.  The gas tank is small and if you travel a lot you'll be filling her up twice a week.  The cabin is also a little on the noisy side, I'm sure they improved on that in later models.  I also miss having an arm rest, but like I said, that is very minor. 

I was once in a small fender bender and was impressed with the safety features, the way the doors took the impact without crashing into the cabin.  Another passenger in the car at the time was also so impressed she later went and bought a Plymouth Breeze (Stratus's cousin, same frame) based partly on that experience. 

I plan on driving this car for as long as I can and at the rate it's going I can easily see taking this car 200,000 miles no problem.
