            I recently got a 2000 Volkswagon Beetle GL and I love it! But I would HIGHLY, I repeat, HIGHLY recommend getting the VW Beetle GLS or even GLX because on my way home from the Dealer, one of my hubcabs fell off as I drove over the railroad tracks. I NEVER thought that something stupid would happen while driving home a new car I just bought 10 minutes ago! The GL comes with hubcabs that can be pryed off with no effort, while GLS and GLX comes with ALLOY RIMS and the opportunity to purchase the Luxury Package for your car. Because I really wanted a beetle, but I was low on cash, I thought, &quot;What the heck?! I'll get the GL.&quot; *Buzz* Wrong! Spend the extra cash and get the GLS or GLX, at least your hubcabs won't be falling off anytime soon. I called the dealer and asked them about it and they told me the alloy rims serve as hubcabs, but they cannot be pryed off. You have to take the entire wheel off in order to take the rim off. I knew NOTHING about the car so now I regret it. I would rather pay more and get better wheels! 

Other than that, you'll feel EXTREMELY safe in the car. There are airbags EVERYWHERE: in the front and on the side. Also, if you're REALLY tall or your friends are REALLY tall, the new VW Beetle may not be comfortable for the passengers in the back. If one were to lean one's head back while sitting in the back, the person may hit his or her head on the rear window. Notice how the rear window of the car curves, almost exponentially..just be careful when you ride in the back.

One more thing, we negotiating with the dealer, me FIRM and ROUGH. That's what I did and I got it for an OK price<br><br>
