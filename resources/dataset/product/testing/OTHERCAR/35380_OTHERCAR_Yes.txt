            We bought our Subaru Legacy back in 1997.  I needed something to drive back and forth to work and serve as a secondary vehicle.  After searching through car lots we came across a 1992 Subaru Legacy Wagon.  Reading in consumer reports that they were a "recommended model" we took the initiative to drive it.  The test drive was a positive one, and we decided to buy it.  There's enough room up front for average sized people, but tall people are a little cramped.  The back seat is very small and overly stuffed. Legroom and head room are limited in the back. Cargo space behind the small bench seat is good.  It is able to fit about 4 large suitcases and a couple smaller things. Our model came with the 2.2L horizontal four.  This engine provides good torque.  It is fast off-the-line, but once underway; acceleration is average at best.  Highway passing power is average also, but takes a heavy foot.  The engine is noisy and sounds gruff when pushed passed the 2000 rpm line.  Highway cruising is average too; it is relatively quiet; the only thing you hear is constant noise from the tires and wind.  Due to the fact that our model has 4WD it is heavier than most compact cars, negatively affecting the fuel economy which is regularily in the low to mid 20's.  This added weight pays off in the winter when the 4WD does it's thing.  It can automatically engage underway, it can also be engaged manually by pushing a button.  The system is a full-time set-up, which means it can be used on dry pavement.  The system's only downfall is that it can only be used up to a speed of 55 mph. 
The Legacy Wagon has been very reliable.  When we bought it used it had just over 100,000 now it has 154,000!  The only problems we have had have been: a broken water pump, a broken oxygen sensor,a noisy fan belt and a loose catalyatic converter shield.
