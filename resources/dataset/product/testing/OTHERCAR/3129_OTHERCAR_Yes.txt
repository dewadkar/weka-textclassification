            After looking at Hondas and Nissans, then the Elantra, I felt the car was the best value.  The 100,000 mile power train warranty was very attractive.  It also had a larger back seat than the other cars we looked at and drove and came with more standard options.  The Elantra we chose has a Self Arming Passive alarm system with many features that can be set by the owner.  Our car has a real spoiler which makes the car more sporty.

My teenage boys love the leg room they have in this car.  We traded in a 1998 Chevrolet Prism when we bought this car.  The back seat in the Prism was small, and mechanically it was not a very good car.  I really enjoy driving this vehicle and the only thing I don't like as well about this car as my previous car is the cd player.  The system has good sound, but the radio does not have a seek feature and the cd does not have a shuffle or random feature.  

We also took advantage of the glass etch offered by Hyundai at an additional cost of only $299.  This is a huge deterrent to thieves, because the policy etched on the glass is kept on file with the FBI and the only way to remove the etching is to replace all the glass in the car.  If the car is ever stolen and not recovered, Hyundai gives you $3,000.

The car has a smooth ride and is fun to drive.  This was my best experience buying a car.  Hyundai really cares about it's customers and follows up often to ensure everything is going well with the purchase.

Families would do well to buy this car, but it would also be a good first car for teens or young married couples.  The spoiler option and sunroof make it sporty enough for the younger generation.

I have had multiple compliments on my car and am enjoying it more than any car I have ever owned.<br><br>
