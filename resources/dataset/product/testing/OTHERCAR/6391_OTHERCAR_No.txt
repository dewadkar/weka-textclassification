            I previously owned a 2002 Toyota Sequoia and sold it because it was a gargantuan truck and averaged a dismal 12.5mpg during my 15 months of ownership. On April 1st, 2003, I bought an XC90 because I like the exterior design plus the EPA window info stated it delivered 15mpg City and 20mpg Hwy. The salesman assured me that it did, in fact, get the EPA stated mileage. 

I've now driven the XC90 for just over 3000 miles, mostly around town, and have gotten a miserable 10-11mpg City and 15-16mpg Hwy. The car has been back to the dealer 3 times and they report nothing is mechanically wrong. In an unguarded moment of candor one of the service techs stated, "That's what they all get"! 

Gas guzzling aside, the car has dozens of other faults with excessive interior cabin noise being the most annoying. The XC90 uses VERY THIN glass on the doors and sunroof, not the thick, sandwiched type that insulates out the wind/road noise. There's a plethora of other faults: The car doesn't have a cassette player so you can't listen to Books on Tape and my daughter can't hook-up her mp3 player. Instead, you get a useless HOLE in the console. The MANUAL lumbar support knobs are sandwiched tightly between the seats and the console, so you must remove the console to make adjustments. The "J" pattern shifter is designed so that if you do not purposefully put it into "D" drive, you slide right past into the manual mode and find yourself driving around in 3rd gear. There's no storage in the roof console for eyeglasses/sunglasses   and there's very minimal console storage. There's NO ashtray (and no lighter). I don't smoke, but I do use the ash tray for coins, candy/gum wrappers, etc. Maybe that's what the HOLE is for?? 

As for safety, the seatbelt warning light is inconspicuously placed at the top of the rear view mirror. There are no reminder dings or chimes and the light fades quickly. I find myself wearing my seat belt less often without an intrusive warning. This is "Volvo For Life"?? Also, when using the key fob remote to lock/unlock your doors, there is no beep or chirp so you never know if the doors are truly locked/unlocked. The effective distance of the remote seems to be much less than my other cars. 

Other minor annoyances include: no compass, sparse interior storage space, some cheap plastic parts, tight legroom space between front and rear seats, and sparse use of wood trim. The bottom-line is that while the exterior looks great, the interior needs significant work to come up to luxury SUV standards. 

Please remember that I own the XC90 and have lived with it through two months of daily use. The above information is reality, and not the result of a day-long test drive.
