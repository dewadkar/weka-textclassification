            I bought this camera because I thought I was so behind the times and needed to have a digital camera to be cool. Anyhow, I had 2 friends with Kodak cameras. one had the 290, and another had the 280. Both friends raved about their respective cameras. I saw both on mobshop.com for very cheap, but opted for the 280 mainly because of size and convenience. 

Personally, i'm of the opinion that if a camera is small enough you will put it in your pocket and take it with you, and hence actually use it! A bigger camera (like the 290), which may have more features, may still be like a brick to carry, so you may not use it as much. I opted for the smaller, more point-and-shoot dc280. Picture quality is a given. I have seen some of the pictures taken with the 280 firsthand and was, frankly, quite impressed. Kodak is known for digital clarity and accurate colors. 

The package came with 4 NIMH batteries and a charger, though my package only came with a puny 8MB compact flash card. That means only 16 pics at high res. Fine, so I went out and ordered a 64MB card off the net. The camera itself has a USB port actually built into the camera, though for some reason it transmits data much slower than the separate USB compact flash reader (though much faster than serial, which is painful). 

I went out and picked up the macro lenses, which are extremely cool for close-ups, however the 2x add-on lens is disapointing because it produces an unacceptable fish-eye effect. And the optical zoom is only 2x, not 3x like many other good cameras. Still, i bought the camera for a measly $400 off mobshop.com with a coupon code and I think it was an excellent purchase. I bought it in march and have taken 3000 pictures to date. it is an excellent first digital camera, and would probably be a good second or third camera. I love this little camera, though nowadays 3 megapixels may be the way to go.<br><br>
