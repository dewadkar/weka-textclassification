            I bought my 2000 Neon in June.  Granted it has been only a few short months since my purchase but I feel I have had enough time for the initial review.

Originally I saw these cars and didn't like the look, let me say I love the look of my Brite Silver, 4-door, fully-loaded Neon.  I get compliments on it regularly.  Actually when I purchased mine we took my sister-in-law along and helped her buy one too.  This turned out to be a bonus.  They gave us the fully loaded model for the same price she paid for her barely above base model -- neither of which did we pay near the sticker price on.

I find that overall we do mostly city driving and average about 25 mpg.  The car is peppy and cute, yet is manly enough that my husband drives it often as well.  The only real down side of the car is the interior color.  The cloth seats are comfy and a perfect fit, however they show every bit of dust and particles.  Our interior is a dark grey color.

Other features we have are a power sun roof, power door locks, power windows (front only), 4-disc CD player w/supreme sound quality, cassette and AM/FM radio, air conditioning, delay wipers, cruise control and probably a couple other things I forgot.  I think the only thing we don't have is tinted windows which eventually we will add.

Overall I find it handles well, has good pickup speed, and is great for long distance driving.  We recently spend from 11:30 am - 10:30 pm driving with only minimal stops.  Never had any uncomfortable times.<br><br>
