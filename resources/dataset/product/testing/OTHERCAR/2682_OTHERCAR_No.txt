            The 2000 Mercury Mountaineer I leased new  and returned after 3 years is the Premier model, equipped with the V8 engine, full time all wheel drive option, and basically all the options available.

Engine, Transmission and Suspension

The Mountaineer equipped with the 8 cylinder engine had more than enough HP and torque to pull the truck eagerly down the highway, although a bit noisily under hard acceleration. Gas mileage however suffered, mainly in city driving, achieving a mere 10-12 mpg (at least it used regular gas instead of premium). Highway driving proved more than adequate as I achieved 20 mpg on many a long highway trip. The Ford transmission shifted smoothly and the seamless full time all wheel drive proved rewarding, not having to shift into and out of 4wd mode when encountering the slosh of winter on the road. The suspension was adequate for a vehicle of this type. It is not a car and will not drive or corner like one, but highway ride was fairly smooth and rough pavement bumps were absorbed without too much commotion. One major headache was the advent of the Explorer/Mountaineer tire blowouts which occurred shortly after taking lease of the vehicle. Ford insisted for 7 months that the Firestone Wilderness AT tires equipped on my SUV was not part of the recall until they eventually replaced all those tires. Braking was provided via front wheel disc brakes and rear drums w/ ABS assistance. They proved adequate. The brake's one drawback was frequent checkups with the dealer for squealing noises which over and over the dealer attributed to dirt and dust and they did need to be replaced once during the three year (and only 33,000 miles at turn in!) lease.

Inside the Cabin

The Mountaineer was equipped with leather seating, power adjustable seats for both driver and front passenger and proved comfortable over the long haul with it&#146s multitude of adjustment and fairly upright seating position. One negative note was a bolt shearing on the driver seatback, allowing the seatback to flop back all the way. While this was fixed under warranty, it proved a harrowing and frightening experience as it took place while under driving conditions. Rear seating accommodations proved comfortable for two full size adults and slightly comfortable in a pinch for three. The cargo area was fairly roomy and become more so with the rear seat lowered providing a flat floor access right to the front seats. The SUV came equipped with all the amenities, including power sunroof (I am 6 feet 3 inches tall and had no problems with head room), an on board vehicle computer (a nuisance as you could look down at it and see 10-12 mpg all the time!) and power everything. Controls were fairly readable and well placed, illuminations were clear. Cabin storage was plentiful including a huge center console.

Major Complaints

A major downside to the Mercury Mountaineer was sloppy fit and finish of trim pieces. The SUV visited the dealer regularly as trim screw pieces would regularly come loose, body side moldings would slowly separate and come unglued, squeaky door hinges needed regular yearly adjustments and license plate bracket hardware (plastic rivets) broke on more than one occasion. The Mach 1 radio, while very powerful (400 total watts) and rich in sound, went dead after 15 months and needed replacement. And as you read above, the driver seatback screw broke providing for a harrowing experience. While no problems were noted with engine and transmission, I do not think that  33,000 miles in 3 years would bring out those kinds of problem. 

This is not my first SUV; the vehicle I traded in was another SUV, which I had for (10) years and never once had to make a trip to the dealer. But it is my first time for a Ford product. And after the experience I've had with this vehicle, it might be my last.
