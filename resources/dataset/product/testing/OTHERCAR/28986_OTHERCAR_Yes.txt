                 Every year, I anxiously await the unveiling of the new Honda's.  One of my past favorites has been the Honda CR-V.  I have driven a few in the past, and I must confess that I loved them.  And so, it was with great anticipation, and high expectation that I drove to my local Honda dealer to look over, inspect, and test drive the new 2001 model of the CR-V.  I was not to be disappointed.

     To me, the look of a vehicle is very important.  Do you believe in &quot;Love at first sight?&quot;  Well, I do now.  Upon entering the showroom, my eyes were immediately drawn to the top of the line Special Edition of the 2001 CR-V.  The color was a Satin Silver Metallic, with body colored bumpers and side moldings, 15 inch alloy wheels, a chrome grill, and an accessory roof rack.

     As I walked around the vehicle, I glanced inside.  My eyes were greeted to a leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather-trimmed seats, rear privacy glass, and an AM/FM Radio, with cassette, and a 6-disc in dash CD changer with four speakers.  It was then that the interior beckoned to me, and I could not refuse.

     The doors opened easily, and closed solidly.  The seats were extremely comfortable, and appeared to have sufficient spring and resilience in them to be able to adequately cushion one's body for the occasional off-road romp.  The interior was surprisingly roomy for a vehicle of this size, and the design of the interior was quite comfortable and ergonomically laid out for full functionality, with ease of use and an attention to detail that was also aesthetically quite pleasing to the eye.  The controls for the sound system, the climate control system, and the various other accessories were all easy to see, to reach, and also felt comfortable to the touch.  The sound system also sounded quite acceptable.  There are many amenities that come standard with this model.  My favorite was the CR-V's cargo floor, which easily lifts out to become a picnic table.

     No description of a vehicle would be complete without a discussion of what's under the hood.  My eyes were greeted to a 146 horse power 2 liter engine.  The engine sports four vales per cylinder and dual overhead camshafts, which together serve to supply the engine with sufficient air and fuel to give the CR-V enough torque to dart around quickly in city traffic, with enough horsepower to achieve smooth, effortless cruising speeds on the wide open highway.  The model I looked at has a 4-speed automatic transmission, but more adventurous drivers may prefer the 5-speed manual transmission which is also available.

     And now it was time for the CR-V to prove to me that it wasn't just another pretty vehicle.  It was time for the final challenge, the all important test drive.  I have always felt that it was important to be able to see where one is going in a car, and I have been disappointed with a number of the new cars lately, especially some of the German made ones, which to me seem to have poor visibility, especially out of the back window.  This is not the case with the 2001 CR-V.  The driver is in a high seating position, which affords excellent visibility of the raod, with over 300 degrees of outward visibility.  I appreciated this very much.

     I had the good fortune to test drive the CR-V on a day where there was a slight drizzle, which as you know, causes the surface road oils to rise up enough to make even flat, straight roads slippery.  If the road was slippery, I sure did not notice it, and perhaps this may have been due to the fact that the CR-V's real time 4WD system automatically engages when you encounter conditions where extra traction is required.  I tested the breaks by coming to an abrupt stop, and the CR-V's Antilock Breaking System handled the task quite well, and I was able to make a clean, straight stop, with no swerving or loss of control.  I next tested the CR-V's acceleration, and was pleased to find that it easily permitted me to enter onto the highway, and to quickly achieve turnpike speeds without any difficulty.  The transmission changed gears in a smooth and seamless way, with no discernable glitches.

     Unfortunately, my local Honda dealer is in a city, and I was not able to personally test the CR-V's off road handling.  However, some of the city roads that I drove the CR-V on could easily rival some off road driving experiences that I have had.  Further, the CR-V's double wishbone suspension, stabilizer bars, and over 8 inches of ground clearance, suggested to me that this vehicle could easily handle off road driving with the same level of comfort and safety that I experienced while driving this vehicle on paved roads.

     In short, the CR-V is a vehicle that I feel I can honestly recommend to any of my friends and family.
