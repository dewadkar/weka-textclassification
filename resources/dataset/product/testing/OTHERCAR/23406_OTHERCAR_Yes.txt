            It's difficult to know what to say about the Olds Intrigue.  It does everything it's asked to do, no drama, no WOW's - it just gets the job done, almost anonymously.  And that may be where the real beauty of this car lies. The Intrigue's almost appliance like demeanor make it a near perfect family car.

At first the styling seems boring, but look closer and you'll see mildly flared fenders and an attractive rear deck lid, rather like a toned down Pontiac Gran Prix. I am not a big fan of Daytime Running Lights, but the Intrigue uses the orange parking lights as the running lights - it's a good idea.  From the front the car looks very attractive.  Standard 16 inch wheels would make any car look good.

I was very surprised how similar to a Ford Taurus the Intrigue felt. Handling and ride are just like a 2000 Taurus. Firm enough to handle well, and soft enough to be comfortable around town.  On the inside the Intrigue feels like a big car, but handles like a much smaller car. 4 Wheel disc brakes are standard, but why wouldn't they be. There is minimal road noise.  Parking is made especially easy by the tight turning ratio - I parallel parked in spaces I'd normally pass up.

The engine is smooth and powerful. Acceleration is among the best in it's class, 215 hp doesn't hurt either.  For the sake of comparison Toyota Camry V-6 has 200 hp, Ford Taurus has 155 or 200 hp depending which engine you get, and the much more expensive Mazda Millenia S has 210 hp, Honda Accord V-6 has 200 hp. The Oldsmobile is not what you'd call fast, but as my wife said, &quot;It takes off without pushing the gas much.&quot; 

Inside are all the amenities you'd expect for a car priced in the mid $20's, similar to a Camry LE.  IN GL trim the driver's seat is power, however the recline adjustment is manual, it's a kind of bothersome. I love the storage bin built into the console, it can hold my wallet, a cell phone, and a couple of cassette tapes.  A center console / armrest that easily holds 6 CD's is nice.  The stereo sounds good, the controls are a little cumbersome. For example, there is only one eject button which makes it impossible to change a tape or CD while listening to the other.  Also the bass and treble buttons are small and require too much attention to use.  The leather seats are nice but lack the quality feel found in other GM cars.

Basically, the Intrigue does what it's supposed to do - get you from here to there without any problems.  It's no sports car, but driving it is not  a chore.

The Olds Intrigue is about the same price as a Camry.   However the Intrigue comes with many standard features that either cost more on the Camry, or are simply not available. Here is a short list:

Traction Control - extra on Camry
Cornering Lights - Not available on Camry or Taurus
Remote Trunk release on key fob  - Not available on Camry
16in Wheels  -  Not on a Camry
Automatic Climate Control - No way on the Camry - Extra on Taurus
215 hp 3.5L V-6  - NO !!
Driving/Fog lights - Extra on Camry

Sure these are little things - but little things add up. More for the money, isn't that what we all want.<br><br>
