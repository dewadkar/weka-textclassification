            I have owned a Mazda Protege 1991 model since March 1991. It is a 1.8 liter engine, 16 valve, automatic transmission, 4 doors, a/c, power steering and power brake model. It brought an AM/FM cassette player radio which lasted about a year or 2. 
Well, I have mixed feelings about this car. The engine is incredibly strong, has run with the same oil and filter for long more than a year. Only completed oil when engine overheated or sounded strange. Hasn't seen Prestone coolant in about 5 years; only water. Last oil change was september of 2002.Can't remember last change of spark plugs, maybe 6 years ago. Still has factory spark plug cables and ignition parts. In all this time (12 years) I changed the timing belt once, CV joints and boots once, water pump once, and the upper radiator cover once. The only major problem it has always had is the automatic transmission. I repaired it once in a professional shop. Lasted only 6 months working good. Then I opened it and cleaned it by the underside once. Then worked ok about 4 or 5 more months. For years I have used it with only 3 speeds working (4th doesn't work). It only runs 30 to 35 mph without 4th speed. Can't use it on highways. Only local short runs. This car has overheated more than 20 times, with the temperature needle up to the maximum measure of heat. Nothing happened. I lowered the temperature using the air conditioning fan and continue running without problem. As a matter of fact, the air conditioning system hasn't worked in the last 5 or 6 years.
Well, this car has gone long years of hard and constant punishment. Hasn't failed more than normal. If you can change the transmission for another one when it fails or buy one with manual transmission you will have a car for many years. I recently bought a Toyota Echo 2003. Don't know what to do with my Mazda. Will think about something... But definitely I recommend it to anyone who thinks to buy a used car.
