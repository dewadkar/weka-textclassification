            I bought a new car because I wanted something reliable that I didn't have to put money into. I bought my Saturn SL2 from the dealership because I thought it would be the best car for the money. Instead of ranting I will stick to the facts and try to warn every person out there who is thinking of buying a Saturn:

At 32,000 miles The engine locked up for an unknown reason and had to be replaced.  Saturn said basically, too bad for me, the warranty was up.  The paint/clear coat is peeling in many places and chips off easily.  The doors and dash rattle so loudly that I just can't get used to it.  The transmission is now going at 64,000 miles.  I am looking at buying a new car but I am having a difficult time because the resale value of Saturns has dropped so dramatically that I owe more on the loan than the car is worth.  

This car has put me so far into debt, between the loan payments and cost of repairs, that I will be hurting for a long time.
