            Rear wheel drive, cute convertible body based loosely on the Lotus Elan, pop-up lights, reasonable performance and fine handling - the MX5 is the archetypal British sportscar built in Japan.

Of course being Japanese you have to do without those traditional British sportscar extras: the leaking roof, the leaky engine, the rampant rust, the rock solid ride and of course the regular breakdowns (both yours and the cars!).

Reliability (like all Mazdas) was 100% fuel economy good and servicing reasonably priced.

The MX5 handles and goes like a sportscar should, what it also manages to do is be a sportscar which you can buy with your head as well as your heart.<br><br>
