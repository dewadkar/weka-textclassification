            When I was a kid, I always wanted to drive a van when I grew up.  I don't know if it was because I would be able to put the surfboards inside and go to the beach or if it was because all of my drums would fit inside when I traveled across the country with my famous rock band.   The full size van was too cool.  Maybe it was because of that hip '70's song.   &quot;Gonna love her in my Chevy Van........ and that's all right with me.&quot;

I turned 18 and got kicked out of the house so I needed a place to live,  My friend loaned me some money (we're still friends today)  and I got a very cool '64 Ford van with &quot;Surfers in Christ&quot;  already painted on the rear window next to a picture of the 'Katin&quot; brand surf trunks surfer dude, so I looked really cool. (at least I thought so) I eventually removed the word &quot;Christ&quot;.  Not because I don't believe in Christ, I just got tired of all those zealots trying to stop me on the road.  Anyway, The van turned out to be a nice place to live in at the beach for a while.  (I didn't think of that option for a van when I was a kid......)

I sold the above van so I could move up in the world and bought a full size '80 Chevy van with a 4&quot; lift kid.  I used to have my friend drive me around with my drums set up in the back while I was playing.  We would cruise down by the pier and have the loudest stereo with live drums!.  No windows in the back of this van........hmmmmm-good for another reason I had'nt thougt of while I was a kid!!!  I had to get rid of it because it was three on the tree manual transmission and my wife couldn't drive it.   (That's another story)

I then got me a small '86 Chevy Astro. (is that bad grammar?)  Which I still have.  I got this because I couldn't afford a full size van. I felt only half as cool because it wasn't full size.

I somehow purchased a Nissan Quest.  I guess it must have been because of the family and kids.  (no rock tours for me across the country)  I happened to be taking the Quest to my mechanic and needed a place to spend some time while it was being repaired.   I stopped by the Dodge dealer so I could drool over the Van conversions.  I knew I could never afford one so drooling was the next best thing.  I was checking out the coolest one on the lot when the newest sales person arrived to pant around me like a puppy.  I saw the sticker........1999 Dodge Ram Van 1500.  I was afraid to look at the price because just the title looked expensive!  I looked down and got a sick feeling in my stomach.....$35,000.  I could never afford that!  I did want to point out something that was wrong on the front window to the sales person.  The paint on the window says 1998 I told him and the sticker says 1999.  What year was it really?  The sales person was quick to point out that the paint across the front windshield was the price!  $19,998.  I almost peed my pants.  &quot;Run get the keys!&quot; I ordered.  I asked how this low price came about on a $35,000 1999 conversion van with 8 miles on it?  He explained that it was one of three of what they call &quot;loss leaders&quot;.  You know when you hear an unbelievable price for a vehicle on a radio commercial and at the very end, ever so softly, the announcer says, &quot;Stock numbers 83476528 and 5378293.&quot;  I was in luck!  I was first in that day to test one of the three at that price.

Needless to say, I bought it!  I love the way it handles, it rides like a truck or sports car in that you can feel the road.  I like to feel the road when I drive.  Its not like a luxury sedan that feels like you're bouncing on a marshmallow.  The passengers in a van ride higher then those in smaller autos so the safety factor is built in.  If there is an impact the passengers are usually above the area of impact and are not injured.  Ever wonder how they get away with no seat belts on school busses.......that's why.  I love the way driving a van lets me see above traffic.  I can see things coming up that I would not be able to see otherwise.  

The interior is very comfortable and there is plenty of space to move from the front to the back.  The rear bench seat makes into a bed that I can sleep on!  I'm 6'1&quot;.  The two middle captain's chairs can adjust to face the rear seat.  The shoulder harnesses are not usable in this position only lap belts.  The middle seats can be removed very easily.  The only complaint I have is that there is no custom arm rest on the outside of the front seats.  There is a standard/stock arm rest on the door which is small and uncomfortable.  I guess the custom rests were removed because they would not go all the way down but would stop on the stock arm rests.  This would be better than not having them at all so if you're thinking about buying this van have them put in these arm rests.  The mileage is about 17 mpg in the city and 21 on the highway.  I did squeeze out 24 mpg on the highway once when I wasn't in the speeding mood. But, frankly, I would drive this van whatever the mileage. I haven't had to have any repairs done after over a year but I maintain my vehicles better than approximately 98% of the population so your results may vary.  (Like I said earlier, I still have my '86 Chevy Astro and it looks brand new!)

My Dodge Ram Van 1500 has a conversion package so it looks much better that the stock picture shown.  It has custom chrome wheel, large tinted windows on the side and a pinstripe.  I have white exterior and charcoal grey interior.  I feel very cool when I drive this van and even cooler when I remember how much I paid and all that I got for it.  A childhood dream come true.  Oh year,  the drums and PA system fit fine and the surfboards for the whole family fit nicely too!

If you're a van person like me and you don't like the box on wheels (GMC full size van) of the Ford because........um well, because its a Ford.  Then the Dodge Ram Van is for you!
