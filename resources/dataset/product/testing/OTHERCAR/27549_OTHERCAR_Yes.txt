            I fell in love with the Grand Cherokee's looks and the amazingly cool sound system, all controlled on the steering wheel.  Basically this is a lumbering American luxury car, with all the toys you could ever want inside. It is an incredibly fun vehicle on a straight road in dry weather. But throw in some road conditions and a little wet weather, and it becomes a slick beast that is non-responsive. I have had some very close calls on cloverleaf freeway interchanges in wet weather. The braking capacity is horrible, and it does not handle rough pavement at all. When you brake on broken pavement, the car leaves the ground meaning...you have momentarily lost control. Not good! As a defensive driver, make sure you have all your moves covered. Leave PLENTY of room for braking. Don't make any quick maneuvers. The car can't handle it. That said, 98% of the time it is a pleasure to drive. But one more downside, the gas mileage on the V6 is not as billed. I usually get about 13 mpg. One time it got up to 23 on the road. Be warned.
