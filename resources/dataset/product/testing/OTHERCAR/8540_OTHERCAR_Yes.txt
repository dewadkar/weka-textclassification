               <b>R</b>eplacing the very popular Chrysler Le Baron, Chrysler's Sebring Convertible is based on the coupe platform that shares its name which harks back almost 50 years. The convertible however has a unique personality and ambiance that makes it a consistent sales champion even into the 2002 model year.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

     <b>The 1998 Sebring</b> was the best selling U.S built convertible for this particular model year, and it is easy to see why. Well designed and well equipped, it has plenty of room, even for rear seat passengers. Because of all the amenities and room provided all adds weight, and this is why the Sebring could do with about 50 more horses and about 70 more lb-ft of torque although. Off-the-line acceleration is a bit slow, but very smooth. Torque steer is next to none and the automatic transmission shifts seamlessly.  The 2002 Sebring models come with a much anticipated optional 200 HP powered DOHC 3.0 engine. An all coil suspension makes the 1998 Sebring a fine handler, plus it has relatively big tires, and front wheel drive gives the Sebring good traction and grip in poor weather conditions. With the top up or down, wind noise and cowl shake associated with convertibles are less than you would expect for a car in the Sebring's price range.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

     The <b>interior</b> of this car is 'super deluxe' in the top of the line JXI models. This model not only comes with the V6 option, it also comes with leather upholstery, supportive and comfortable power seats, and more than enough amenities to go around. The AC is cold, which comes in handy in the summer. I found this car to be very pleasing to drive on long distances, even with the lack of out-right power. The plastics are all relatively high quality and the fake wood doesn't look overly tacky as with many cars offered from Chrysler. Overall, the interior is the saving grace for the Sebring and makes up for what the Sebring lacks in the performance department.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

     The <b>exterior</b> of the 1998 Sebring convertible kinda reminds me of a smaller, more narrow, early 4th generation Camaro. Many I have talked to do not share this opinion, but sometimes from far away I can't tell the difference. This car, although much slower than most V6 base Chevrolet Camaro's, they are much sleeker & sporty looking. The lines are well incorporated in the body work to create a very sexy convertible.

<i>Pricing:</i>

   A 1998 Sebring JXI's <b>price</b> tag is still pretty high, even 4 years later. The JXI will run around $15,000 for a used '98. This car has had pretty good resale compared to other previous Chrysler cars.

  <i>Conclusion:</i>

If you are not looking for out-right performance, but want a sporty look, embellishments commonly found in expensive luxury cars, but don't want to sell the farm, then the up-scale Sebring trim lines make for a good value on the used car market.
