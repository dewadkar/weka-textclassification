            I wasn't planning on buying a car last January. I mean, like everyone, I thought it might be nice to have a new car, but it just wasn't in the cards anytime soon. Besides, I already had a 1995 Honda Civic Coupe that I was in love with. I even wrote an epinion about it. Then fate struck, in the form of a gargantuan pick-up truck rolling through the back half of my Civic while I was stopped at a red light. There's nothing quite like a totaled car and a fat check to send you out into the world of car dealerships. 

At first I was determined not to buy from the dealer that sold me my Civic. I bought it new and basically felt as though I had gotten the shaft. I was happy with my car, but unhappy with the price paid and a few other odds and ends. I live in a small town, so that only left me with one other Honda dealer to check out. 

Now, I knew that I wanted an Accord this time around, but thought for sure that a new Accord was out of my price range, so I was checking out used Accord sedans. What I really wanted was a Honda Accord station wagon, but unfortunately they haven't made those in quite some time and they are next to impossible to find. I always chalk that up to a high satisfaction rate, seeing as how it is my dream Honda.

I checked with this other dealer, but the selection was lacking. I gave in and made my way to the original dealer. Right when I got there I told the salesman why I didn't want to buy a car from them. This worked wonders, he suddenly seemed very interested in being extra nice to me. I looked at their used selection, but it wasn't very exciting either. We discussed price range and I kept it lower than I expected to spend. Then he asked if I had completely ruled out a newer Accord. I told him yes, but being a salesman he talked me into looking at the 2001 Accord VP (aka: the Value Package). 

I admit, I liked it, but I wasn't about to tell him that. I checked the car out and took it for a test drive. The price tag said $17,000, I said, "I'll think about it."  I returned to the first dealer and they offered $16,000, but only had the car in dark green with a beige interior. That wasn't happening. So I called up the other guys and they matched the price. I gave in. I know... I'm a sucker. 


The deal with the value package is this: You get a 3-in-1 combo stereo with a CD player and cassette deck, and the trade off is no power locks or windows. This suited me fine because I, apparently unlike the rest of the universe, HATE power locks and windows. The two cars I have had with them were nothing but trouble. There was always a window getting jammed, or a lock getting stuck. Power locks and windows are an automatic detractor when I am looking at cars, I can't stand them and don't have the first clue as to why people are so enamored of them. So this was the deal for me.So, the Accord Sedan VP is an automatic, with a great stereo, no power locks or windows. They take into account that living through a South Carolina summer is the pits and throw in tinted windows ( not obnoxiously tinted ) and a very powerful AC.

The weird thing is that the car isn't a DX or an LX, I don't know if they had a lot of LX's that they screwed up and forgot to put power locks and windows in, or what, but it makes it a pain in the rear when getting insurance. The lady was like, "VP??, what's that?" I said the same thing at the dealer, but he gave me some line about it not being a DX or an LX, and how Honda was phasing out the DX, etc... etc... It made no sense to me. Essentially, this is an LX without the irritating power extras. But let me tell you about the car...

The first thing I noticed was that this baby is HUGE...I mean giant. Way bigger than my other Honda, way bigger, in fact, than my boyfriend's Buick. The exterior is silver, the interior a light gray which I am sure the dealer refers to as some sort of "mist" coloring. The interior of the car is very roomy and open. The seats are large and comfortable. I am about to take the car on its first long distance drive, and I am confident that I'll be comfortable the entire ten hours. The back seat area is gigantic. I haven't had cause to ride back there yet, but it looks very comfy. And it can fit three large dogs with room to spare, which is very important when we have to make a vet trip.

The controls are all within reach and layed out nicely. They are flipped upside down from the controls on my Civic, but after a while I got used to it, and I like this set-up much better. There are plenty of little cubbies all over for storing CDs and tapes, two drink holders, one of which has this little adjuster thingy in it, so that soda cans fit snugly. I personally liked the old-style Honda cup holders that sprung out of nowhere at the push of a finger, but in retrospect, they always did seem kind of flimsy and were impossible to clean. Being a non-smoker, I was thrilled that instead of a lighter and ashtray, there is a power source and a felt-lined change tray. I marveled over the novelty of that for quite some time.

The stereo, which I've already mentioned, is awesome. The speakers (front and rear) are good, though I see myself improving them in the future. I like to drive while listening to LOUD music, and while these speakers can handle loud, they sound a little weak when I kick it up that extra notch to hear my favorite Devo song. Things like that are important. The only gripe I have is that I can't rewind a tape while listening to a CD, but I don't even know if there is a car stereo that can do that. And it really isn't the end of the world in any case.

The car drives well, it handles well... it IS a Honda after all. It sits much higher than my Civic did, and being a shorty, I like that. However, I don't feel as secure when driving at high speeds. That could just be age creeping up on me, but I was kind of disappointed to not be able to drive over, say, 95 mph without feeling like I might drive off the road. That being said though, the car does have a lot of speed and pick up. My Civic always seemed to drag a little when driving up big hills, but this baby flies over them like flat ground.


Now... what I DON'T like. There isn't much. I don't like the way it looks. There's a lot to be said for function over beauty. My car is very nice, it will last forever or at least until some cowboy in his mile-wide farm truck decides red lights don't mean stop. It's comfortable, has a great stereo, excellent AC/Heat, but... it looks like an American car. Now, spare me the comments about American cars, my Honda was assembled in Ohio someplace. I'm talking aesthetics here. 

It is going to sound silly, but the worst thing about the way the newer Hondas look are the tail lights. Honda cars used to have these cute tail lights, similar to what Volkswagons have now, I think. A Honda was sure to be an aesthetically pleasing, aero-dynamic, "smallish" car. My 2001 Accord is bigger than most comparable American sedans, and equally attractive. It seems big and clunky to me, instead of sleek and beautiful. Who knows... maybe it will grow on me. Really though, the complaint is so minor that I wouldn't consider it a factor in purchasing.

The gas mileage seems to be a little lacking too. On the LX I think it is listed as 26/32 mpg, but I could be wrong. It just doesn't seem like it lasts very long. I'm always having to put more gas in it, and there is an annoying little warning light that comes on at about a quarter of a tank. I say if you can't read the gas gauge, you deserve to run out of gas. There is also a service light that is slightly irritating. When you are about 1,000 miles away from a scheduled service it flashes a few times whenever you crank the car. The closer you get to the mileage for that service, the longer the light stays on. If you don't get the service performed once the odometer rolls onto the specified mileage, the light stays on. I understand the purpose, but sometimes you make it to the dealer a few days late and you have this damned bright orange light shining up at you the whole time.  


These few minor complaints aside, I definitely suggest a Honda to anyone in the market for a new, or used, car. Hondas, by reputation, are some of the most dependable, long lasting cars available. I can only say that this has been my experience as well. My new Accord Sedan is spacious, it drives well and I am very happy with it, looks aside. And it looks like they've altered the tail lights on the 2002 model, so maybe I'm not the only person who isn't into the "American look" on a Honda automobile.
