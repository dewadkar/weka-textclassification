            I've had an SUV for about 10 years now, and the Durango is the first on that I find to be just right.  Just right in size (I'm 6'-4&quot;), just right in power, just right in features.  Slightly larger than a Ford Explorer on the outside, the interior room is significantly larger, fitting even my large frame.  It has plenty of power and cargo room, without taking over the entire garage (A Lincoln Navigator, my other choice, wouldn't fit into the garage)  

Based on past experience, I purchased the vehicle with a cloth interior.  I keep a vehicle for 8 - 10 years, and the leather just doesn't hold up as well, and the cloth is easier to replace.  The stereo is adequate though nothing to write home about.  On very hot summer days, the air conditioning takes a little while to cool the interior, but that is a symptom of the new refrigerants in use today.  

The 4 wheel drive system and anti lock brakes work very well, enabling the vehicle to maintain sure footing even in deep snow and heavy rain.  The 4 wheel drive control can be a little finicky to engage, and tight turns are a challenge when it is.  The V8 delivers more than adequate power, with rather disappointing gas mileage.

Overall a well made, well designed vehicle ready to take on the treacherous supermarket parking lot.<br><br>
