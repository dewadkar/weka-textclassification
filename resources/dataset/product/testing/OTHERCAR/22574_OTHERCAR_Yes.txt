              Close your eyes and imagine your flying. You can feel the cool whisk of air flowing over your face, and your favorite music is playing flawlessly in your ears. Your blood turns to pure adrenaline, and the sensation of wheeling around turns is enough to want to make you scream with excitement. This is what it feels like to drive a Pontiac Trans-Am.

  I first looked into buying a Trans-Am because of its name reputation of being a sporty muscle car. Upon further research I found it to be one of the best looking vehicles in the history of American cars. Its beautifully designed curves make it look like a sexy supermodel. In comparison with the Chevrolet Camero, the Spoiler &quot;Wing&quot;, and flip up headlamps make all the difference.
  Although the engine, suspension, transmission, and all other features (except for appearance) are the same, the Trans-Am still (in my opinion) out performs the Camero. Comfort is another essential quality utilized by the Trans-Am. With inflatable bucket seats that fill from the back and the sides the seat alone is enough to hold onto you like a gentle hand. Unlike the Camero, The Trans-Am seat also offers an adjustable head rest. In a Trans-Am you feel like your riding in a lazy-boy chair. And there's no better feature to accompany your wonderfully sexy, comfy car, then an awesome stereo. The Trans-Am offers an eight speaker stereo with a full equalizer. The Camero has a seven speaker system and no equalizer, simply a Bass and Treble knob. Trust me, a many a day I have found myself listing to my favorite CD's in my car as apposed to my home stereo.

  So you�re probably thinking, &quot;What's the catch?� Sure it's great that the Trans-Am is powered by a V8 297hp 5.7l LT-1, but that also means it guzzles gas like its water. Along with the expense of gas, there's the problem with matinence. Once you�re out of a warranty, you�re also out of luck. A simple SES light (service engine soon) cost $90 to check out at the dealership, and from there the price only goes up. But regardless of large-scale matinence, small-scale matinence can be pricey as well. Optimum performance is maintained by regular oil checks, which should require synthetic oil ($40-55). And best handling performance usually comes from Z rated tires ($500-1500). So if you but this car, either make sure your a mechanic or related to one.

  All in all I love my Trans-Am more then anything (don't tell my girlfriend), and there's nothing better then detailing it, and the taking off the t-tops to take a drive along the beach. I highly recommend this car for the sports car lover, and not for the every day driver. And make sure you can fit it into your budget before you start hawking your mother�s jewelry.
