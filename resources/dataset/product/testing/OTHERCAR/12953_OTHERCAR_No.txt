            We bought this vehicle because it had been advertised to be comparable to a Toyota Camry.  We were leasing a Camry and wanted to get out of the lease.  Because the Malibu was much less than a Camry and supposedly equal in quality, we bought it.  Although the cabin is large and comfortable, the quality of the rest of the car is horrible and in no way does it compare to the Camry.  We had our Camry for nearly two years and had nothing wrong with it all during that time.
   Within the first week we had the Malibu, it started squeaking.  Main problems:  Control Arms; Rotors.  We're on our 3rd set of control arms and 3rd set of rotors and they've already been turned once.  The mirrors vibrate (can't be fixed-&quot;that's the way they are.&quot;); the horn has gone out once; the driver's side window malfunctioned and it took 3 service visits before it was fixed; the two remotes have only worked at the same time for about the 1st 6 months we had the vehicle; the passenger side window leaks;  the trunk has leaked; we had to replace the tires far too early (because of the bad rotors and suspension;) both outside mirrors had to be repainted because of peeling paint.
   A friend who has a 2000 Malibu had to have rotors replaced before she had even put 5000 miles on the car.  If you should want to buy a 97 or 98 Malibu, make sure aftermarket parts have been installed.  Our next set of rotors will definitely not be GM parts!
