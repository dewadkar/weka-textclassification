            After tons of research, the stats and feedback we read on the Camry sold us.  We were looking for a late model used Camry under 30K miles.  We couldn't believe how they held their value.  After a great deal of comparison shopping, we got a deal at $15K.  We've had it for over 18 months and love it.  We have received many compliments on it's style.  

It has the following options:  power windows, cruise control, power moon roof, tilt wheel, ABS brakes.  It is a 4-cylinder but has lots of power and handles very well. Mileage is great. We were used to driving large cars (Mercury Grand Marquis and Dodge Grand Caravan).  

Both of us were very surprised at how comfortable and roomy this car is. Even large people are comfortable in the front seats.  Average people (not too tall) fit nicely in the rear seats.  I recommend two for the back seats, but three will fit ok on a short ride.  The car feels very solid and safe.  

I was rear-ended while stopped at a light.  The front end of the large car that hit me was destroyed.  Although I was jolted, I couldn't believe it when I saw that there was no damage done to the Camry.  Also, my teenage son was in an accident.  We couldn't believe how the Camry held up in this accident.  I feel my son was saved because of it's strength.  It's been repaired and is still going strong.  

It took us years to convert from American-made vehicles.  We finally smartened up and until something comparable is made in the USA, we'll continue to buy Toyota's.  <br><br>
