            Aurora is a finely tuned to the human body as your own skin, which means that when it moves it also moves you..

:Stylish.... The body is long and taut, there is no grill so the sweeping lines flow without interruption.
From the front , its stance is aggressive , looking like it will gobble up the road. The first time you see it you will want to touch it, and then drive it,the seats are so tailored that you'll wonder how in the world they got your measurements.

The Aurora 4.0 drivers seat remembers your most comfortable position. The heated front seats warn you on demand. Even the tires tell you when there not properly inflated and the stereo is just finger tips away.
