              Though it's too early to give a thorough review of the 2000 Dodge Durango SLT, many things are evident right out of the showroom.  The ride is relatively smooth yet firm and it takes corners well.  The seats are quite comfortable with the exception of the third row seat which I don't recommend for long rides.
  There are many nice features like the combination CD and cassette player with Infinity speaker system.  This is one of the best factory sound systems I have heard.
  The 3.9 liter engine is quite powerful and has a deep throaty hum when you step on the gas.  It really takes off.  But alas, all that power comes at a price.  Gas mileage is quite poor.  I average about 9-10 m.p.g. in the city.  Highway is only slightly better.
  If poor gas mileage is not a concern, then this sport utility vehicle will make any driver quite happy.
