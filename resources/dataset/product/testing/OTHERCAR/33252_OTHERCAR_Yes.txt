            First off, I don't consider the E10 to be a professional camera.  Due to the CCD being smaller than regular film, you can't get the depth of field control that you can get with a regular film camera, and that limits your portrait creativity. 

The handling of the camera is great, it feels very much like a regular SLR, by weight and by function.  (in record mode)  In playback mode, this camera is slow!  going from picture to picture, zooming, etc... very slow.  (my current Canon Pro90 IS is much better in this regard)

I wish it had interchangeable lenses.  I understand olympuses decision based on the threat of dust in the lens, but using a teleconverter leaves a lot of possibility of haze from too many refractions, etc.  With the Teleconverter, pictures end up quite hazy sometimes... colors lack snap, etc.

I really like the Oly flash... the Fl-40 performed great and is a very interesting design.  

Watch out for the infared focus assist... it's easy to block with your finger, and suffers from some parallax issues... but you can shoot in almost total darkness which is cool. 

Viewfinder is great, nothing but pleased with it... but why does it blank when you take a shot?!  it's not like there is a real shutter in there. :)

I was very happy with the camera, right until it bailed off my motorcycle at 95 mph, causing it to be very quickly demolished.  C'est la vie. 

It eats through AAs, definitely carry a spare set.
