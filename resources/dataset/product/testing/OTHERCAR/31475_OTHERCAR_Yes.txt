            I have wanted a digital camera for a very long time, and after looking for a very long time, I came to the conclusion that this one was the best I could get.  They were selling the Agfa ePhoto 1280 at Costco Online for much cheaper than other cameras of the same, or even better, quality. I compared it to many other cameras of the same quality and price, including the Sony Mavica, and found this to be a much nicer working product.

When I first got the camera I was instantly in love.  It has a swivel lens for taking pictures at angles impossible with other cameras, nice zoom and resolution options, flash options, and a beautiful lcd display.  The best part of the camera, however, is the ability to see the pictures as you take them on the lcd.

The pictures themselves are absolutly beautiful. Aside from the fact that the software only allows you to upload the images into the software assigned directory, the software itself is very nice.  You are able to view all images in a directory simultaneously, and edit them one by one.

This camera has been more than a camera for taking pictures of things to sell online... I've taken it with me on family vacations, school fieldtrips, days spent with friends, and any other picture worthy occasion.  Despite the fact that you can only hold so many pictures before you have to upload (ammount depends upon picture resolution), it's a great all around camera that would seem great for anyone at anytime.<br><br>
