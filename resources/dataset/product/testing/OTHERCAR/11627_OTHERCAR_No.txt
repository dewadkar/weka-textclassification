                <b>I</b>f the Mark VI had been somewhat somber, its successor, the mark VII was anything but, at least in later years. It combined both modern aerodynamics and classic retro styling touches. It also, in later models offered great straight off-the-line grunt. Despite its 1984 low power output rated at a modest 140 HP, this car was not exactly slow, but does require patience.

      <b>S</b>ettle yourself behind the odd-shaped steering wheel and take it all in. The plush leather seats are comfortable and supportive, and there are electric devices to cater to your every electronical need. Today, the interior of the 1984 Lincoln Mark VII looks every bit 'early 1980s' but this Lincoln did it with more class than other luxury cars of this time period. 

The 1984 came with 2 engines, a limited diesel which had 110 HP, and did not sell well at all, and a 4.9 liter OHV pushrod V8 ( also known as a detuned 5.0). The 4.9 is the same engine that was in the 1984 Mustang GT better known as the 5.0 , but was detuned, and only came with a 2 bbl carburator. Power did rise to 165 HP in 1985. When Fuel injection was finally introduced in 1986 power rose to 200 HP.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 


Once you hit the gas pedal in the 1984 Mark VII ,it takes a second for the engine to realize that you want it to move, it kinda reminded me of turbo lag, only there was no turbo on this car; go figure. But once this car got moving it accelerated without too much fuss, and since this is a very well insulated car, road noise and engine noise are minimal. 

<b>Handling</b> is surprisingly good for such a large 2 door personal luxury coupe. Driving this car is also simple, with the power steering, the Mark feels like a much smaller car. The Ride is smooth, and hills are not too much of a problem for this heavy weight, thanks in part to the 4-speed automatic transmission, and the engine's torque out-put. 



<b>B</b>uilt on a 108.5" wheelbase 'fox' platform (shared with the shorter Ford Thunderbird) the mark 7 has a  typical front engined, rear wheel drive configuration with struts in the front and a live rear axle. In place of the coil springs, are cylindrical airbags. LSCs have thicker anti roll bars,wider, high speed tires, and sure grabbing 4 wheel disc brakes. There are no air bags available for 1984.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

  The <b>interior</b>, as I have already mentioned before, is quite 'old fashioned', but there is loads of standard amenities, such as a trip computer, which tells you how many MPG you are getting, how long tell your destination etc., there are automatic headlamps, power seats, a center console, tachometer, and a variety of warning lights, and power everything. A 4-speaker premium sound system by Ford is offered, along with a keyless entry system. The most collectible of the 1984 models are the <b>Versase</b> edition along with the <b>Bill Blass</b> edition. 


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>
    
      The <b>exterior</b> has flush headlamps, aero headlights, very 1980's Thunderbird looking, only with more class. Although heavily based on the contemporary Thunderbird, Lincoln stylists sought to differentiate the Mark by adding a traditional simulated spare tire mount in the trunk, thicker C-pillars, and a chromed grille and trim.


<i>Pricing:</i>

   The <b>price</b> for these cars are going for very cheap. With a new energy crises people are looking for cars with better gas mileage, and the people who are looking for luxury cars are going for new high tech material. I have seen 1990 models for as low as 900 dollars. But expect to pay around $1,000-$3,000 for a 1984-1990 Mark 7 LSC. New, these cars were a shade under $24,000.

    My 1984 mark VII was very <b>reliable</b>, it was not the best car I have ever owned by any means, but it got the job done. Since this car did have 230,000 original miles and 4 different owners, I can't really complain about the  money I had to spend on new rear shocks, and a new headliner.


<i>Conclusion:</i>

If you are in the market for a full-sized luxury coupe, the 1984 Mark VII is definitely worth a test drive. While the engine may not be as refined as its import rivals, the price, and much of the interior make up for its unsophisticated powertrain.
