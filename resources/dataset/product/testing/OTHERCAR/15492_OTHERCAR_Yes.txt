            This camera was my second Sony digital (I also have a Casio and now am the proud owner of a Nikon) and I continued with Sony because of ease of use, however, the picture quality does not do group shots or intricate scenery justice.  For those who want adequate pictures and extremely simple operation needs this is your camera.  You just need to understand the camera's limitations.  

The lithium ion battery is the work horse of the industry and serves this camera well.  It recharges quickly (30-90 minutes) and lasts for ~180 minutes in non-flash situations.  Moving images from camera to computer is a snap and is not dependent upon platform (Mac or PC).  The Mavica comes with adequate software to manipulate the pictures as well.

Flash balance varies but can be changed after you get a 'feel' for certain situations.  Color renditions are fairly accurate as well.  The only critique I have is in the quality of the images.  They seem to lack an edge or crispness.  While large objects are very recognizable, smaller objects can become indistinct, including faces in a large group.  All the Mavica cameras have this 'problem' as well (with the newer ones handling the images a marginally better).  

If it is quality images rivaling 35mm that you are looking for, spend a few extra bucks and get the Nikon (see my review of the Nikon CoolPix 990).  However, if you are looking for a simple to use camera, with inexpensive, reusable film, and an interface with a computer that even a 5 year old could learn, then this is the camera for you.  <br><br>
