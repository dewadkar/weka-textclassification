            When my happy little 1996 Honda Civic DX died an unfortunate and tragically early death in an icy-road-induced accident, I thought my heart would never mend.  Unlike some people, I wasn't handed the keys to a new car the day I turned sixteen.  I had to work for my first car, and at the ripe old age of twenty-two, I finally had a job that would barely allow me to make the payments on my shiny new red Honda.  I got so attached to that little car; it got me through countless 2,000-mile sojourns from Tucson to Pittsburgh and back for summer and Christmas breaks from grad school.  If a car can get you through the Arizona desert in June, you can't help but develop a deep bond with it.  After the accident, and after I stopped crying and moping around, I spent a few months in a borrowed car and a few more months in Ireland, where I didn't need a car.  Then I moved to Atlanta and had finally healed enough to start looking for a new love...er, car.

I am normally opposed to American cars, since I've watched my parents struggle time and again with good ol' US cars that barely outlive their warranties and end up costing more to fix than they're worth.  But, God love 'em, my parents are stubborn people, and since my dad about had a heart attack when I had first told him I was getting a Honda, I decided to take it easy on him this time around and buy a Saturn.  It was the only American car (well, at least the only one I could afford) that I would consider buying.  (My parents have struggled with trying to keep up a couple of Chevys, a Ford, and, most recently, a Plymouth minivan that needed a transmission overhaul the very month after the warranty ran out.)  Saturn's great lease deal drew me in, as well as the fact that I didn't have to haggle over the price.  I would be so bad at that that I'd probably embarrass myself.  

Saturn is big on being down-to-earth and friendly.  You sense this from the time you walk in the door.  Both the agents I worked with were people pros -- they were amiable, chatty, and concerned, and they were very good at appearing genuine.  You always get that creepy feeling that comes from knowing they're just trying to sell you a car, but I suppose it works on a lot of people, and I can't say it didn't work on me.  I did feel well taken care of, and when we went back to the dealership on subsequent visits everyone remembered us, even our names.  

Enough of my ramblings. What about the car?  I chose an SL-1, a decent-sized 4-door sedan, very nice-looking in a shiny gold color.  I'm the sort of person who really only has two requirements in a car.  The most important:  Will it get me where I need to go as safely and reliably as possible?  And the second:  Is it as environmentally-friendly as a motor vehicle is capable of being?

The SL-1 passes my tests on both counts.  The only reason I considered a Saturn in the first place was because I had a friend who had hers for five years and has never had a problem with it.  It's gotten her everywhere she needed to go with no major problems or repairs to make.  As a single woman who does a lot of driving in all sorts of weather and climates, it's crucial that I have a car that I can rely on, and so far Saturn passes the test.  I've read a lot of the Consumer Reports comments on Saturns and I can see from their evidence that Saturns are reliable in the long run, have a high resale value and a large percentage of drivers who choose another Saturn after they trade in their first one -- all very good signs.  

And as far as safety, the SL-1 has passenger and driver-side airbags as standard equipment, and a galvanized steel frame for added protection in rollover situations.  If you're interested enough to go to a dealership, be sure to ask a salesperson about the frame; at the dealership we went to, there was a stripped-down car on display so that you could see the frame for yourself.  One note, though: anti-lock brakes are NOT standard, so if you want these you need to make sure you ask for them specifically.   

The SL-1 is very fuel-efficient and so far the maintenance has been a breeze.  In a city full of SUVs (Atlanta), it feels good to drive a car that is a little easier on the environment.  So my two major requirements for a car are fulfilled in the Saturn.  What else do I like about it?  The CD player is standard, there are drink holders galore and the displays are easy to read and work with while driving.  The windshield wipers have about a zillion different speeds, good for those in-between is-it-raining-or-not? moments, and there are daytime running lights and good strong headlights (one of my few complaints about my Honda was its weak headlights).  

This leads me to my complaints.  Since my main requirements for a car are taken care of, the complaints are minor, but enough to detract from my overall experience.  The main problem is the choppy engine.  I know very little about the technical side of cars, so I'll use my layman's terms:  this car does not have much power.  It gets you where you want to go, but it might make a little noise and shift gears a little roughly to get you there.  At the dealership they made a big deal out of the fact that the 2000 models had had major engine overhauls and the engines run a lot more smoothly now.  I find this hard to believe.  When I'm trying to accelerate quickly or move up a big hill, I really start to miss the smooth engine in my Honda.  The other main complaint is the interior of the car.  I realize it's supposed to be a simple, stripped-down car, but I would think the designers could have put a little more thought into how the inside looks.  Everything seems pretty cheap and bare-bones; there's no reason why things couldn't have been designed a little more attractively.  

The bottom line, then, is: if you want a power vehicle, buy the SUV or the pickup truck.  If you want a car that has all the qualities of a Saturn with a better engine for just a little more money, go for a Honda.  But if you just want to get where you're going safely and efficiently, and especially if you're concerned about &quot;buying American,&quot; a Saturn is for you.  Please note that I am only recommending the car with the above caveats in mind.  And if I could figure out how to give it 3 1/2 stars, I would.  (How the heck do you do that, by the way?  If someone could let me in on the trick, that would be great.)    

(A little side note about that: Most American cars now have plants that either manufacture or assemble parts overseas.  Even if you're buying an &quot;American&quot; car, there's no guarantee you're actually supporting American workers.  For a really fabulous movie about just this issue, see &quot;Roger and Me&quot; and read my soon-to-come review of said movie.) <br><br>
