            I bought my 98 Chevy Metro used in may 99 with only 1500 miles on it. Black, manual trans, no a/c, the basest of base models. I live in northern california where gas is pushing $2 a gallon and my Mustang is a gas hog so I needed a cheap commuter car. 

I now garage the mustang and pull it out on occasion to joyride then back into the garage it goes. My metro is great. Great milage, great zipping through traffic, corners well. Not much pickup on the highway but in the city it is great. 

The first punishment I put it through was parallel parking on a steep hill in San Francisco with a load of 5 people in the car. No problem. Plenty of power for the hills as long as you are not going fast. On a recent road trip to Las Vegas I found it did 85 no prob on the straigh aways but once it hit a large foothill it was pedal to the metal just to get 50 mph. That can be a problem when you have large trucks all around and it's raining... But it made it there and back on 2-1/2 tanks of gas which comes out to 39.5 mpg. 

I have never really gotten 50 mpg out of it I don't think anyone really has. But 30-40 true mpg is not bad. 

Plus the little tires will be cheap to replace when they wear out. The oil is easy to change yourself. And the car is big enough inside for me at 6'3&quot; there is still headroom leftover. 

Who knows how it will last. But I have the extended warranty to 70k miles and I get all the maintainance done on time so I am hoping to have it for a while.

All in all highly reccomended for commuters, students, sunday drivers and cheapskates!<br><br>
