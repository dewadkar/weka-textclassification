            I got this camera for Christmas from Ritz Camera, from my parents, which replaces the Fuji Finepix 2800 that I had stolen from me while travelling a few months ago.
This is an excellent camera, and certainly a very worthwhile replacement to the FinePix.  My main complaints up front are two: the optical zoom was 6x in the Finepix, and only 3x in the s30, and the FinePix also took AA batteries, so in a pinch, it was easy to find power. 
These 'gifts' came with a price--the camera was almost square to account for the large lens and room for 4 AA's inside the case.

Not so with my wonderful, pocket-sized s30.  I can't begin to describe how excited I am over the punch this pint-sized camera packs.  I carried it with me on a snowboarding vacation, and it easily fit into one of my coat pockets.  (I'll update this with a link to photos when they're available).  With the 3x optical zoom, you can get a wide variety of images.  There's a macro lens for close-ups, and also a host of built-in easy-to-use options for various photo types--action, portrait, landscape, color tones (b/w, sepia, vibrant color), and of course, Manual and Auto.  The white balance works great, and you can use it to emphasize different parts of your photos (sky/landscape for instance).  

Another bonus, compared with the Finepix, is the optical view finder...the FinePix had a small electronic view finder...this did not work well in low light conditions.  With low-light conditions on the s30--if you don't see much on the LCD, you can use the optical view finder--of course, it only shows about 83% of the actual photo, according to documentation.

The case is very durable with a sliding cover over the lens.  Occasionally the cover doesn't line up appropriate with the other side, but it has not been a problem for me, yet.  Sometimes when pulling the camera from a pocket, I found the cover open...I am not sure when that is due to my pocket opening it, or it sliding open inside my pocket...I think buying a small case for this would be a good idea.  Canon offers one, but I'm thinking of buying a small neoprene case like the ones body glove makes for cell phones and PDAs instead.

The camera comes with some excellent photo software, too. The stitch-assist function lets you add-together as many pictures as you want (I think--so far I've stitched 3 with good results).

On the downside, Canon only includes a 16 MB CF card.  What a waste.  You're going to need to buy at LEAST a 64 MB card, but I recommend getting as big a card as you can afford (check out pricewatch.com or froogle.com for the best prices).  Plan on spending $50 or more in this dept.

After 1 month of use, this has been a great camera. I'll update this review after more use, but it's highly recommended as of now!
