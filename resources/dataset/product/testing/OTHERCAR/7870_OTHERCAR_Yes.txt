            First, before you read any farther, you need to know that I'll be coming at this review as a non-car-expert consumer, which is how I think the majority of car buyers approach these purchases.  Thus, this review doesn't contain a lot of technical specifications - I'll leave that to all you car hounds out there.

As a small business owner, I was interested in taking advantage of the newly-improved tax laws for small businesses purchasing vehicles/equipment over 6000 pounds, so I went car shopping.

To determine which vehicles I might be interested in, my accountant gave me a list of those vehicles over 6000 pounds.  Then I began doing my research online.  First, I compared the list with Consumer Reports' recommendations and found that there are only a handful of vehicles on the list that Consumer Reports liked.  Then I narrowed that list down to those I thought I could stand.  Not being able to see myself driving a pick-up severely narrowed the list, I don't mind telling you!  As you might guess from this last statement, I can be something of a "princess", and am used to a certain level of luxury in my vehicles.  Until last week, I had been driving a BMW X5 which I really didn't like that much.  (Note that the X5 is over 6000 lbs. itself - amazing, but true - but I was anxious to replace it nonetheless.)

So, the Sequoia made the cut and I went out to test drive it.  It comes in 2 versions - the SR5 and the LTD, which is the more fancy - and of course, expensive, by about $4000 -of the two.  I test drove both, but ultimately couldn't justify the extra expense of the LTD, and thus bought the SR5.

After first setting eyes on this monster, my husband thought it was just too big for me.  (a full 204 inches long!)  In the past, I have not been comfortable driving Land Yachts.  However, I decided to try it out anyway.  Wow!  It's great!  It drives like a much smaller vehicle, and is so quiet you'll be amazed.  The Sequoia is based on the Toyota Tundra pick-up, and has a 4.7 liter V8 which is very thirsty - if I average 15 miles to the gallon, I'll be surprised.  It's bigger than the 4 Runner, and smaller (and lots less expensive) than the Land Cruiser.  I'm quite sure it could tow anything you wanted to tow, but didn't spend any time checking this out, as I have nothing to tow at this point.  It has 3 rows of seats, but I couldn't recommend stuffing all 3 seats full of adults, as you'd most likely be over the weight limit, and would definitely be over your comfort limit.  However, my 3 kids are absolutely in heaven with all the room.  

Consumer Reports rated this vehicle "excellent" in all categories of it's Reliability History category.  That right there meant a lot to me, having had one brand new vehicle in very recent history (no - I won't slander any manufacturer here) that broke down and stranded me numerous times.

Now for what I call the "toys".  I don't mind saying that extra little add-ons really appeal to me.  Things like a compass, lighted mirrors, etc. have a certain appeal.  As a dedicated Princess (see above paragraph!), I just don't feel comfortable in a stripped down vehicle.  Although the SR5 doesn't have everything I hoped for, it does have a lot.  I finally have my compass back, which is great.  It also has a 6 CD changer, which is also great.  (You can probably skip this option and save a few hundred bucks but most of them come equipped this way.)  I also have AM/FM/cassette.  In mine, the front seats are all 6 way power adjustable, with power windows and doorlocks all the way around.  Most SR5s come with remote keyless entry and cruise control.  Mine also has a power sunroof, and it's HUGE!  In addition to the cigarette lighter, the front passenger side has TWO power outlets, and the 2nd row has one.  Also, the 2nd row has their own air conditioning/heat control, which is quite extensive, and works very well.

As far as what the SR5 DOESN'T have, or at least what MY vehicle doesn't have, the visor mirrors do not light up,  there are no radio controls on the steering wheel, and the steering column doesn't telescope.  Also, there are no "memory" seats that remember your individual setting.  Oh yeah, and if you see me in a parking lot with my lights still on, it's because I no longer have lights that automatically shut off.  Good thing I carry jumper cables!  Most of these options are most likely available for purchase, and on many/most of the LTD version vehicles.  I just decided to live without them.  I'll be fine.....  Yeah, don't worry about me.....  One other interesting thing that Toyota does relates to leather vs. non-leather.  In order to get what is called the Leather Package on the LTD, you'll pay close to $6000.  However, if you want leather on the SR5, you can add it for about $2000.  In my area, they send the vehicle to a custom shop and replace the cloth seats and door panels with leather, and add heated seats - another must have for we princesses!  This will be happening later this week.

On another disappointing note, given the 3rd row of seats, the rear cargo area is way small.  However, you can lay both the 2nd and 3rd row of seats down, or even "tumble" them forward.  This is not difficult at all, and will give you more space, which you will need if you buy more than about 5 bags of groceries.  The great thing, though, is the large amount of storage area throughout the rest of the vehicle.  Everywhere you look there's another storage compartment.  This is a vast improvement over most other SUVs I've driven.

At this point, I have just over 100 miles on my new baby.  The gas gauge is down about a quarter tank (ugh!), but it's fun as heck to drive.  And this is the first vehicle I can ever remember owning where my husband is as anxious to drive it as I am.
