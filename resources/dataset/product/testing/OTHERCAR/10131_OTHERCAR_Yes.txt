            <b>Okay, work with me here... The dawn of the sport utility vehicle is very much analogous to the evolution of higher organisms millions of years ago. No more than 20 years ago, huge, unwieldy station wagons roamed the earth (following me here?), moving families and cargo from place to place. Then, by some inexplicable phenomenon, they disappeared. And so it came to pass that the minivan and later the sport utility vehicle would take their place as the family vehicles of choice...</b>

The Nissan Pathfinder is practically a newborn in the sport utility market compared to some competitors, but is still a great example of how far sport utility vehicles themselves have come since their recent start. It all started in 1989 when the &quot;no-frills&quot; Nissan Pathfinder was introduced into the market. Void of any luxurious doo-dads or even family-friendliness, it was the quintessence of sport and utility. After being completely redesigned in 1995, however, things started to change. Then one day someone said &quot;hey- can I get some leather in this thing,&quot; and suddenly the Pathfinder found itself in the unlikely scenario of being a luxury vehicle by 2000. This is surprising since the luxurious Infiniti QX4 (clone of the Pathfinder) has been around since 1997 to cater to such interests. Even so, the Pathfinder has strayed from its utilitarian background so much that Nissan felt compelled to make another &quot;back-to-the-basics&quot; SUV, the smaller and cheaper Xterra. How the Xterra's popularity affects Pathfinder sales remains to be seen...

Not too long ago I wrote a review on the Isuzu Trooper and how it barely edged out the Pathfinder in a purchase for my aunt. Please note that the Pathfinder was beaten by such a slim margin that we regretted we could not buy BOTH vehicles. Luckily, I spent quite a bit of time with the Pathfinder during the decision-making process. Here are my impressions:

<b>EXTERIOR:   9</b>
The Nissan Pathfinder got a major facelift during the middle of this year (hence it's the 1999.5 model), and the 2000 Pathfinders have seen little changes. The exterior of the Pathfinder is a little bit of Mozart and a little bit of AC/DC. It's <b>classy, refined, and even graceful, yet rugged, seemingly indestructible, and ready to rock.</b> You can definitely see the Pathfinder for what it is and for what it once was. Yet even though the advertising emphasis is no longer utility but luxury, the Pathfinder is still quite capable of taking on anything you throw at it. It has a unit body construction resulting in reduced weight, increased torsional rigidity, and more car-like handling. The spare tire is tucked underneath the rear cargo area, which is not the placement of choice for true off-roading. Still, this caveat is probably academic: I seriously doubt the majority of Pathfinder buyers will ever take these rigs off-road... even though it's more than capable.

<b>INTERIOR:   8</b>
My musical references to the exterior do not match the interior. This time it's ALL Mozart (or Beethoven, Brahms, Haydn- you get the idea). The upper trim LE models allow you to sit in the lap of luxury, as far as SUV's go. <b>The styling itself is perhaps a bit pedestrian, but interior quality on ALL Pathfinder models is top-notch</b>. I was really impressed by the logical placement of all the controls on the dash. The white faced gauges provide good visibility.
The stereo is within reach, and large buttons make programming and station-switching a breeze. The Bose audio system injects you with great sound through its six-speakers (both Mozart and AC/DC would be proud). 
The leather seats on the LE were good quality, although I couldn't seem to settle in right, the power adjustments notwithstanding. The rear seat is a bit skimpy compared to vehicles in this class. Still, there is plenty of room for cargo- 85 cubic feet, to be exact, with the seats folded down. As a comparison, the Jeep Grand Cherokee holds only 79, the Rodeo 81, and the Trooper 90.2 cubic feet.
While I'm on the topic of cargo room, I was a bit disappointed by the rear passenger room. Hip and headroom were satisfactory, but standing at 6'3&quot; you can imagine legroom was pretty tight for me. Seat three back there and things get even tighter: sitting in the back with my aunt and uncle, we felt a little cramped.
Access and egress are not bad, if you don't mind a little bit of climbing. The rear doors seem to be a bit narrow and they have the door handles on the rear pillar- something I always thought would be a pain if you had a heavy load of groceries and you had to lift your arm way up there to open it. But that's just me...

<b>ENGINE:   5</b>
Ah, there's always an &quot;Achilles' Heel,&quot; and in the Pathfinder, it is the engine. Despite improvements in power, this engine (3.3L, 170-hp, 200lb-ft. torque) is <b>still lacking sprite.</b> The Pathfinder lazily climbs up to higher speeds, even when you punch the gas. Official 0-60 measurements are around 11 seconds, I believe- but don't hold me to it. The engine is also surprisingly noisy when you push your foot down. It really clashed with the otherwise quiet and luxurious cabin. But for driving around town, I believe the Pathfinder is more than competent. And, this engine will allow you to tow up to 5,000 lbs. Just don't think you can win any races at stop lights. More importantly, be careful merging with traffic or trying to pass someone.
<i><b>UPDATE!</b> For 2001, all of this will change with a major power boost. The Pathfinder (and its more expensive twin the Infiniti QX4) will get a brand spankin' new 3.5L V6 engine which pumps out <b>240</b>hp and 265lb.-ft. torque. That's respective gains of 70 and 65, folks. I eagerly look forward to driving the 2001 Pathfinder and relaying my experiences to you.</i>

<b>RIDE:    8</b>
The Pathfinder <b>rides very much like a car</b> considering its size and weight. I give credit to the unibody construction mentioned before. Compared to SUVs built on ladder frames (from pick up trucks, usually), the Pathfinder is quite civilized in keeping its composure when dealing with road irregularities and such. And despite my complaints about the engine, the vehicle is still pretty fun to drive. The suspension and larger tires are a couple of upgrades in the 1999.5 models, and they contribute to better city driving and highway cruising.

<b>HANDLING:   8</b>
Another improvement for 1999.5 was the wider track (by 2&quot;). This helps in turning stability, which was very noticeable. There is still some body lean (like it or not, this <i>is</i> an SUV), but the wheels stay on the ground and you hardly shift in your seat even when making moderate turns.

<b>FEATURES AND VALUE:   7</b>
The Pathfinder is available in 3 trim models: the XE, SE, and LE. The XE models of this alphabet soup come in equipped with ABS, auto trans., A/C, privacy glass, an alarm, and alloy wheels. The SE offers you the choice of a manual transmission (odd), tubular side steps, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, power windows, locks, and mirrors (heated), driver's height adjust, and remote keyless entry. LE models are loaded with all the plush stuff like leather/wood trim, side impact airbags, the Bose stereo system, outside thermometer, compass, and additional exterior cosmetics (special wheels, fog lamps, chrome accents).
This is a pretty impressive list of features, but the Pathfinder has <b>traditionally been priced a little too high</b>. It's a little less than the Toyota 4Runner, but significantly more expensive than the Jeep Grand Cherokee or Isuzu Rodeo. However, resale value of the Pathfinder is very good.

<b>THE VERDICT: TIME HAS CHISELED A CONTENDER</b>
The Pathfinder's evolution has occurred over a few short years. It is a great car, minus the weak engine, which is the solitary obstacle standing in the way of awarding 5 stars instead of 4. Still, the reliability of the Pathfinder has been excellent, and to sweeten the tea, the 1999.5/2000 Pathfinders have <b>great dealer incentives</b> on them right now, because of the previously mentioned engine upgrade for mid-2000. Whether you wait or not, you can't lose. Just choose your bliss- extra cash or extra power. In the meantime, <i>this</i> Pathfinder has made a fan out of me. Including the dealer incentives, I give it an 8 out of 10. You would be smart to consider it. And when you pass the occasional old station wagon, try to contain all that excitement from driving the higher evolved species...

<i><b>NOTE:</b> For some great insight on the whole &quot;evolution&quot; discussion topic, I highly recommend that you read a comment that was left for me by <b>mtngoat</b> on this review. It should be the second comment, entitled &quot;A few minor points...&quot; </i>
