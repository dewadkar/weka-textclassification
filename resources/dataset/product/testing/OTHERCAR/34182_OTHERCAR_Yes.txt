            We bought our Passat used when we were originally shopping for the new Jetta Wagon. I am glad that we got a 2 year old Passat instead of the new Jetta for the same price. 

Everyone hates the cup holders, cruise control and the glove box. The brakes do make a lot of dust. I don't like the velour interiour, it picks up all kinds of hair, sweater lint, etc. and won't let it go! Also, we have been through a set of tires at 20k, which seems a little early. (The dealer would give us the prorated discount on new tires, but the whole package was cheaper at a tire shop than the discounted ones at the dealer. Go figure...)

But, those are all small prices to pay for a car that is more than a commodity, but you don't get the feeling that you are just paying extra for the name plate and a snooty sales guy who serves espresso while you chat about financing. The V6 30 valve engine rocks, torquey to the extreme. It has traction control (individually applied brakes in the case of wheel spin) that helps control that on ice and snow (which I just experienced getting out of a snowbank and the curb wheel was on a solid ice sheet. The traction control put the brake on that side and the street wheel pulled it from the snow bank.) The ABS has also been helpful recently for the same reasons.

It is hard to put the feel of solid German engineering into words. Like a friend who got an older Passat after driving all kinds of "appliance" cars, including some expensive models, said: "Can't tell you why, but I am never going back!"
