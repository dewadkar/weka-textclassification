            First I'll start by telling you that my last car was a 1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass supreme that we bought brand new, I have to tell you that I loved that car almost as much as I love my husband.
Anyway my husband came home from work one day and told me about a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am that he had looked at that day and he wanted to know if I wanted to go look at it, my words to him were the only way I will even think about getting a different car is if the payment is lower than we are paying now, we had just bought our first house so I was worried about being able to pay all the bills.
So we went to look at it and to tell you the truth I wasn't all that impressed with it, it was loaded, everything is power including the moonroof which for me was the plus, so we talked about it and really couldn't decide whether or not to buy it but we finally decided to do it, well the one we drove had been dealer traded and they didn't have another on with exactly the same features anywhere.  The dealer searched everywhere for one so we ended up ordering one.
Well in the meantime I had a little fender bender in the Cutlass, so finally 2 months later our new car came in.
We have had this car for 5 months and I have to tell you I still miss my cutlass. 
The Grand Am is a nice car but it seems to be alot harder on gas.  I also think the road noise is awful.  I like the car but I think I will always miss my cutlass.<br><br>
