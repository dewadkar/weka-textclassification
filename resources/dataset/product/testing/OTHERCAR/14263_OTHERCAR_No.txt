            I bought my Truck brand new. I was the only person to even put the initial 11 miles on my "midnight creeper". 

This was my baby. Isuzu told me there was nothing different with the 93 & prior years 88-92 same body. However, I don't believe them. 

I completed tune-ups every 25K, along with transmission fluid, and suspension. New oil and filter 2500 miles. I had two set of wheels & tires, one for 4 wheeling. The other when I wanted to drop the vehicle, and low-ride. The transition only took me about 1 1/2 hour to accomplish. I bought many aftermarket upgrades. Chrome everything in the engine. Washable filters, snug top, and all sorts of stereo equipment. 

Yes, I spent some time and money here. Now let me explain my first statement. I have known other year model Isuzu pickup to last over 250K miles without major work. 

But the 93 on the other hand. Hits 80K, and now you have white smoke out the tailpipe. After confronting my other compadres about this, everyone I know with a 93, has informed me they also had a warped head, including me. 1991 seems to have a seriously excellent record. 

After getting the head replaced the problem reoccurred, 6 months later. Now, this is ridiculous, I have stayed on top of the maintenance, and still this problem. No other problem EVER. I contacted Isuzu, and said everything here. They claim they have never received any record of this. That's been really a lie; this was the same shop that replaced my first head. ($1800) Yet they could find the original of the receipt I have. 

Needless to say, they would not replace the 2nd head. They attempted to state since I did not bring the vehicle to them for maintenance, they could not validate the repairs. 

I no longer have this truck, but I want a 1992 as a replacemt.
