            Since purchasing my Sony MVC-FD92 digital camera. I have only used a regular camera maybe twice, I still have a roll of film in it that I need to finish.

This camera is <b>*easy*</b> to use. I was taking pictures and video within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box. I cannot recall a purchase that I have been happier with.

The only thing that I do not like about it, is how it takes the picture. You click the button, it flashes and then takes the picture. My toddler doesn't stand/sit still that long, but it is making me a better amateur photographer.

This camera uses both the Memory Stick technology AND 3 1/2 inch floppy discs. (Both sold separately) I have not seen how many files I can get on a 32MB memory stick yet, but I have had 40 on the stick and still had more room.

It comes with a USB adapter so you can hook it up to your computer and download the pictures. Or you can copy from your memory stick to your floppy and just stick the floppy in your computer. The latter is a little more cumbersome, but works great when your computer doesn't have a USB port.

There is a color LCD display to view what you are taking and to do a play back. You can delete pictures that you do not like while they are still on the camera. No more wasting money on processing pictures with someone's eyes closed or when they have turned their head on you.

There are 3-4 settings that you can use to take your pictures also. There is normal, black and white, sepia and I think one more. I have not tried any of these settings yet. I have only had my camera a couple of months.

With the digital camera, you can either upload your pictures to a number of online photo places for printing or (depending on the printer you have) print them yourself. The latter is the option I choose. The only way people can tell that I have printed them myself is if they touch them. I use regular ink jet paper, but they turn out fabulous.

I bought this camera because I wanted to be able to share pictures and little videos of my child (and any children to come) with family members who don't live near us. And being an employee of Sony, I get a discount. :)

6/20/01 - Update. I have found one other thing that I do not particularly like about this camera. The 5 second videos only look good when viewed on the camera itself. I have a little video of my son and a new monitor. I can make out his features, but not very well.
