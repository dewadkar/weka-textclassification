            My husband and I purchased this camera probably about 6 months ago or so - and we are so happy that we did.

This camera has been great for us.  The price was very reasonable for a camera with more than 3 mega pixels.  We bought this camera for personal pictures - vacations, holidays, special occasions, etc.  However, I recently have become more interested in photography - and this is an excellent camera for me to start experimenting in photography with.  I have been taking pictures with this camera that I didn't think possible - the clarity is very crisp and I have no complaints whatsoever.

The only thing that really seems to bother me about this camera is that it eats up the battery power of the 2 "AA" batteries that it requires pretty fast - if the camera is used non-stop for a given time.  My solution for this is keeping extra "AA" rechargeable batteries with a charger at my home, and I always keep spares in my camera bag - just in case the batteries lose their "juice".  The battery charger, along with a couple "AA" batteries, was very inexpensive - no more than 10 to 15 dollars.

The movie mode is a great extra - however, I have found that that mode uses up battery power faster than anything else.

The 16mb memory card that came with it help up to about 21 pictures - which was fine, but I felt that I needed a larger memory card, so I purchased oner with a larger memory for about 45 dollars from Target.  This new memory card holds up to about 90 pictures.

I think that the buttons are are pretty easy to understand and the camera is very user friendly.  All of the software that came with it (photo editing, photo directory - where you upload your photos, and even a movie slide show cd for your computer) are pretty user friendly, as well, and very practical and convenient.  Very easy to install, and the cord that attaches the camera to the computer is pretty easy to figure out, too.

I definitely would recommend this camera to any beginner in digital photography or even an experienced person, at that.
