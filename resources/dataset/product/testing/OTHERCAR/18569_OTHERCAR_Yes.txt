            I have used other cameras before, Agfa, Olympus, Kodak, Polaroid...

This camera was around 500 dollars when I bought it over a year ago. Since then I have had it in Australia, Europe, 
S E Asia, and around the USA.

What I like is, it is light, easy to carry, has many automatic and manual options such as F stop and shutter speed options that can be used for straight photography or like I used..hooking it up to my telescope and using it for astrophotography. 

It takes 43 mm lens attachments which are easier to find, and has a rotating lens assembly that goes 360 degrees which makes tough shots easier when hanging off a cliff or in a tight spot. The Night function works better than any other digital camera I have seen, and it actually works! Most other cameras I have seen with this function do not work well at all in night mode. 

The 8x optical zoom is great, considering higher cost cameras have around 3x tops. The digital zoom on ANY camera is a negligible function however, as you need a tripod and no breezes to get a really good shot, and they are rarely clear shots.

It has USB, rs232 serial, power connections, and a remote control that works nice as well. This is fairly close to a SLR, though Olympus has a better feel like a SLR. This has the feel of a small camcorder, but it is comfortable. It also has continous shooting which is awesome for sports and family. Along with an AVI function, Panorama, Portrait, Night, and Scenic functions. You can take a virtual 360 degree panoramic shot like the ones you see in Real Estate websites! Menu is very easy to use, and uses standard memory cards. It is also very durable. I have dropped it, flown it, carried it in damp, cold, heat..and no probs. My daughter is 14 and uses it with no problem at all. 

As for the large LED screen, makes it nice to see what you are shooting. The lack of a viewfinder is only a bummer in bright light, but for 10 bucks you can buy a screen that blocks the light allowing you to see the screen shot even on very sunny days.

For all the versatility and functionality, you would pay 3- 4 hundred more to get these functions in another camera with the quality of pics. I highly recommend it, especially now when you can get them for just a couple hundred or less used, or around 3-4 hundred new. AFter all, unless you are printing magazine quality prints, you do not need any more pixel resolution than is provided here.  Good luck!
