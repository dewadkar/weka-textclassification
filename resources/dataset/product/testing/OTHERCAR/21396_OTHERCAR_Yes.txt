            This car has great gas mileage.  Especially with the gas prices going up you need a car to fuel efficient.  The stereo system in the car has the same effect as a top of the line system installed by a car stereo company.  We took a road trip that was over 1,400 miles, about a 1 day trip, and the leg room was fantastic. And the handling is awesome.  The front wheel drive makes it a good car to be out in bad weather with because of the tire grip.  Anybody that is smart and cares about their family when traveling should seriously consider thinking about purchasing this vehicle.<br><br>
