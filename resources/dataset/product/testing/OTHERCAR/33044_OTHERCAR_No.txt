            When my dad's trusty old Caprice Classic was hit by a Geo Metro, it was written off -- you should have seen the Geo --and it was time to buy a new vehicle. At the age of 11, I used my influence to convience my parents to buy a Dodge Caravan. Boy was I stupid kid.

Right from day one we had problems with the vehicle. The power locks ceased up, thus locking us in the car, forcing us to drive back to the dealership to get them to open the doors, and diagnose the problem. The transmission kicked it three months later -- a totally new, tranny was installed under warranty --. The locks ceased up several other times - fortunately without anyone inside. The air conditioner stinks like dog doo when it starts up -- since the day we bought it. The vehicle hasn't even reached the 150,000km mark, and that's just a run down of the problems from the first 25,000km.

Other major problems.

We're on our third tranny, brakes (rotors and all) die after 10,000km -- only pads are covered under most warranties --, middle windows have wiggled out on to the road, and the window seals do any but seal. Three starters have died, and the steering is stiff and according to the mechanic at the dealership "impossible to repair".

The paint started flaking after five years, dispite frequent trips to the detailers over the years.

I won't even get into the time the travel computer crashed, leaving the vehicle without brakes, while travelling at 100km per hour. To this day, my mother refuses to drive the van fearing that this will happen again.

It's not all bad. It's powerful. quick from a stop, and even quicker when in motion. That's about all, I can say that's good about it.

All vehicle have their problems, and when your vehicle is the workhorse of a single vehicle family that needs to drive everywhere to get around, and the chariot of a reluctant teenager and his friends, you're going to have problems. But there's a line between wear-and-tear, and lemon. The Caravan motored on through the intersection into Lemon-Land like it was nobodies business.
