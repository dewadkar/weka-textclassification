            I purchased this vehicle used, with 44,000 miles. This vehicle was GM's (hasty) solution to compete with BMW's 3 series, etc. This vehicle is a re-badged Opel Omega (sold in Europe by GM). Although the European version of this vehicle is reported to be a reasonably well engineered vehicle, I can assure you that the Catera is a big "dud" that will go down in history with the Vega, among others as perhaps the worst vehicles ever sold in the US. In spite of the Catera's good looks, it is probably the most troublesome automobile available on the used market today! The engine has serious flaws. Over a period of time, (usually every 30,000 miles or so, The timing belt will break due to poor design, and subsequently, the valves will bend and you will be looking at THOUSANDS in repair bills.(this is due to a faulty timing belt tensioner that cannot be fixed due to the design flaws) Parts are OUTRAGEOUS,and it is unlikely that you will get anyone to work on this vehicle other than the dealer. (one Cadillac mechanic at the dealership told me that he got butterflies in his stomach when he saw me pull up with a Catera) The mechanic also told me "those cars can't be fixed", explaining that the car was a piece of junk from the time it rolled off of the showroom floor! He said that Cadillac knows about the problem, and that is why they do not make them anymore. (Although he said that the new Cadillac still had the same Opel engine?!) The vehicle cannot be aligned properly due to manufacturers defects, and subsequently the tires need to be replaced every 10k miles! The electrical system is a nightmare. The moonroof will open and close on its own! Fuses blow left and right for no apparent reason! The transmission is a joke. It is slipping at 60000 miles. Brakes constantly fail as well. Please don't take my word for it. See what other people say about this vehicle!! Stay away from this vehicle at all costs!!!! I travel a great deal, and I see Cateras broken down on the side of the road all of the time. (usually timing belt failure) Out of sympathy, I always stop to offer assistance. I now have a 1998 Catera that sits in my garage because I am afraid to drive it, and I owe more than it is worth. Beware!!!!!!! This car is the worst car that you could ever buy!! This is no joke. There is not a fix for the problems of this car, only a temporary solution. When you read the reviews, keep in mind that the individuals that have left favorable reviews for the most part, have less than 30k miles on their Catera. Run away from this car, and run as fast as you can!!! Another remark that I want to make is that the gas mileage is absolutely awful.Since I owned this vehicle, I have never gotten more than 18 miles per gallon! I had a V-8 explorer that got better gas mileage than the Catera! How can a 3 liter engine burn so much gas!
Although I would like to give a better description on the other aspects of this vehicle concerning the handling, power etc, the negative aspects of this vehicle outweigh the positive so strongly that I find it irrelevant to mention the positive attributes of this vehicle.
