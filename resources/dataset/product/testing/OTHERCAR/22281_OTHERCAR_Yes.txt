            This vehicle has to be one of the top minivans on the market today!  This May, our family decided that the old 1991 Toyota Previa needed to be replaced by a new minivan.  We first looked at the Honda Odyssey, mainly because of the magic seat in the back(by magic seat, I mean a seat that folds down and disappears into a well near the back hatch door).  Then, my family went to an auto show to see what we could find out about the Honda.  We say the Odyssey and saw what we expected to see.  We then went to look at other minivans while we were at the auto show.  When I saw the MPV, I immediately noticed that the van was very sleek and attractive.  The old MPV in my opinion, were one of the ugliest vans I had ever seen, but the new 200 model is one of the best I've ever seen.  As most minivans these days, the Mazda has two sliding doors, unlike the one on the right side of the old vans.  The MPV also has one feature I've never seen in a van before.  The windows of the sliding doors can go down just like the front windows.  Although they only go down bout two-thirds of the way, that's more than enough to cool down the back seat and captains chair area.  Also, the back seat does disappear into the floor, just like the odyssey.  The two captains chairs in the middle of the van can either be folded down into somewhat of a cube or they can be taken out all together.  One neat feature about the back seat is that you can leave it in its upright position, then pull the strap to fold it down into the seat, and the seat inverts itself making a chair facing out the back of the van.  This feature would prove extremely useful for camping or tailgate parties before a game.  The captains chairs also have a neat feature.  They can be in their regular position, creating a sort of walkway down the center of the van, or with a flick of a lever and a slide of the seat, can form into a solid bench, much like older vans such as the much older Plymouth Voyagers had.  This makes loading up the van easier, so kids don't have to crawl over a person sitting in a captains chair.  Now onto other features(and those first ones were only the seats!).  One real quick feature I like is a rear air conditioning control.  This consists of a front control and a rear control.  In the back seat, there is a little knob that controls the a/c. In the front, there is another knob under the regular a/c controls.  On the front knob, there are choices: off, rear, 1,2,3.  The people in front can chose the power of the a/c in the back or can put it on rear, and let the people in back control their own air flow.  This would be used if little kids were in the back and kept on messing with the a/c.  The front of the van is very roomy, with lots of leg room for the front passenger, and enough for the captains chair people to be comfortable.  The higher end model, the ES, has a nine-speaker stereo system with a CD player standard.  the ES also has leather seats and wood trim, making riding shotgun a joy.  With the Mazda MPV, no longer is cramming into the family minivan an unpleasant experience, but more of something I look forward to.  The MPV also has remote keyless entry, allowing the driver to unlock his or her door with a push of the button, and all the other doors with another push.  The keyless entry consists of an unlock button, a lock button, and a panic button.  Although most people probably don't think about it, the MPV is extremely well lit.  There are map lights in the front, a solid light bar in the middle, and a light on the back hatch door.  There are also little courtesy lights on the driver and passenger doors.  On thing Mazda claims about their MPV is that it drives like a car.  This is true.  The Mazda has front wheel drive and has a very smooth drive.  It's fuel consumption is 18 city, 23 highway.  It has a moderately powered engine, a 170 hp V-6, which gets you where you need to go, although on very steep hills you sort of have to gun it to make it.  Also in the car, I forgot to mention, there are cup holders galore.  up front there are two cup holders, in the middle there is a bottle holder on each sliding door and a cup holder that slides out of one of the two captains chairs.  In the back there are also two cup holders.  Also in the back there is a 12 volt socket so that when the back seat is in tailgate part position, you could plug in a TV or an electric habachi to cook hotdogs or something.  The MPV has an almost endless list of features, most of them for the convenience of you, the driver or passenger.  This van is great to drive in, and maybe even better to ride in.  I cannot imagine having any other van besides the Mazda MPV.<br><br>
