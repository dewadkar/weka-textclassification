            Found this the in one of the day after Thanksgiving sales for $154, and for a 3.2M it seemed an excellent deal.
Let me start off with the one and only real draw back to this camera &#150 the lens cap. It is a flimsy piece of plastic that never, I repeat never stays on the camera to protect the lens. It does make a nice dangly thing off the wrist strap though. The first thing I did was go and find a small camera case to protect the lens.
Now on to the great things&#133 The prices is tremendous for a 3.2M, when it was advertised I tried to find it on the internet, the closest I could come was to the 4330 in the US, I did find reference to it on some overseas sites. It appears this was made originally for the European market, and could have been a &#147sale&#148 leader for an individual store chain. As I have yet to see it for sale anywhere else.
We have used this camera in many situations and different lighting &#150 it typically produces excellent quality pictures. We have noticed in dark conditions it tends to over compensate occasionally, as my family doesn&#146t get into the gadgets as much as some, we have never really investigated all the light compensation features.
This is a great little point and shoot camera. 
The USB connection is somewhat unique and propriety to Kodak, which if you wanted to have one for the home computer and one for the laptop would require a direct buy from Kodak at their prices.
We have been using alkaline batteries with it, with 20 to 25 pictures per set. Next purchase for this camera is a couple of packs of rechargeable.
Over all this has been a very worth camera, not as nice and fancy as some, but it is meant to be the family camera.
For those that may have weight considerations, it is very very light weight.
