            I have always been an Audi fan, and this is my first. I have always found Audi's very well-designed and engineered, and not as stodgy as Mercedes Benz's or as pretentious as BMW's. The 2.8 liter V-6 is a little slow off the line, but once you get the rev's up the car really flies. Passing power is exceptional. Car's braking and handling are on par with contemporary BMW's at a fraction of the price. 

I bought the car with 62k miles. This means I have to replace the timing belt and water pump, an expensive repair, but if it is not done the consequences are serious. I know Audi's can have a rep for being fickle, but if well maintained, an Audi will provide thousands of miles of reliable and enjoyable motoring.

I find the interior very comfortable. The radio controls could be better. The heated seats have been a blessing, and they are very supportive and comfortable. The liberal use of wood, high-quality plastics really make the interior a pleasant place to be. It is easy to find a comfortable driving position in spite of the fact my car lacks an adjustable steering column. The blood-red gauges are easy on the eyes and impressive to look at at night. I think the power window controls are set too far back for comfort; I feel I have to take my hand farther back than I ought to.

If there is one thing I really don't like about this car is that it lacks a remote switch to open the trunk. For such a prestigious car, the lack of this feature is unforgivable. My last car, a Volkswagen Jetta had one, so I cannot understand why this car does not have one. Also, tilt wheel should be standard. My outdoor temperature display bulb burned out, which is a $150 repair, which is totally unreasonable.

In sum, the car is drop-dead gorgeous (mine is Burgundy with a grey interior with 10-spoke alloy wheels), drives like a thoroughbred, and is exceptionally comfortable. My beef's with the car are minor and should not deter anyone from considering it.<br><br>
