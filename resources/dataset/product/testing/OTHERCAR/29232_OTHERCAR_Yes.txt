            After adding up all of the fixes that would be required to bring out 1994 Toyota Camry back to the point where we only disliked driving it, my wife and I started test driving cars to see what was out there.  We were drawn to small wagons because of the cargo space and rear room.  We have a 2 year old and going out and about most weekends requires a full compliment of gear.  Safety was also a concern, since we got into a little fender bender when we hit locked the brakes and slid into the back of a truck this winter.  Also, we live in Baltimore, which means tight parking.  Finally, if the car had a stick and was fun to drive, all the better.

Basically, we wanted a cheap Porche with Volvo safety that was shaped like a toaster.

Most of our desires were met by the 2003 Mazda Protege5.  One reviewer wasn't impressed by the styling and I can see how some people would not be too turned on by the aggressive front styling tied to the traditional wagon backend.  But we thought it was cute.  Ours is a classic red one with only the ABS/Side airbag package, which will hit you for $500.  That brought our MSRP to $17,545, still a reasonable price for a car of this quality.  Mazda seems bent on pitching this car to kids a few years younger than we are and, searching the web, this was the only car I found in stock at any dealership around me with this configuration.  More common is the moonroof/6cd player package that would have been nice, but wasn't as important to me as keeping my kid alive.  

The Protege5 comes with one engine - a 130 hp DOHC that, while hardly spritely, is a blast to drive in town.  Maybe it is just because I am used to the doughy ride of the Camry, but to me the handling in the Protege5 is phenomenal.  I find myself playfully cutting tight little turns in second that would have sent my Toyota into the guard rail.  Luckily, I am saved by 4 disc brakes that provide good stopping power for such a cheap car.  The shifter and clutch on the manual are very smooth, and I found that I was able to very quickly adapt to the new car, something that usually takes me a couple drives.  The car does not fly on the highway, so you won't be challenging any BMWs out there. But I just wanted a fun, safe family car, so it is just as well that my clean driving record will stay in tact.  What the car does provide for long trips is a nice comfortable ride that will quietly keep you at 65mph.  Cruise control is standard, and the engine gets a good 31 mpg on the highway, so the in town sports car becomes an economical family hauler for the trips to grandmas.

I thought I was going to be turned off by what appeared to be a garish interior.  But the silver is a strange muted color that isn't too glossy and appears, as my wife called it, "adult."  We liked it.  The stereo has 6 speakers standard and a cd player.  A tape player is optional.  Some people argue that the stereo is weak, but we are not the share our music with the world type.  Still, one day after buying the car my kid and I were able to drown out the Ludacris coming from the car in the next lane with They Might Be Giants "No."

I am only 5'11, but am disproportionately tall in the torso, something that makes a lot of cars feel cramped to me.  Not so in this car.  While at the controls I still have a good couple of inches of room, better than even other Mazdas I sat in in the showroom.

All and all, I wasn't ready to buy a car yet, but I am so glad I did.  I bought in March 03 and dealers were ready to haggle.  After some negotiating, we got the car for $16,400.  Not bad.

Update 8/2003:  After almost 6 months of driving we still love our Protege5 and most of the review still holds up.  No defects detected.  We just spent 5 days driving through New England and save for the fact that my daughter demands that we listen to the same CD over and over, no complaints.
