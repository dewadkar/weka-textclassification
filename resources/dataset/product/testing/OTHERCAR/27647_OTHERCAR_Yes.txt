            I bought the Hyundai Accent when I was still in college in 1995. It was the only thing I could afford in a brand new car that was somewhat substantial. So, trusting what the salesman said that &quot;it's a reliable car&quot; I bought it and 84,000 miles later, I haven't looked back.

Hyundai just changed the body style and some interior stuff for the 2000 models, but everything is still pretty much the same.

I've had the minor little glitches with the car (all parts covered under warraty) but you get that with any car you buy. The warranty on this car is the best in the industry...100,000 miles on the powertrain and something like 75,000 bumper to bumper.

I bought the two door hatchback, so although I can't speak for the four-door, this car is peppy, fun, and 150% reliable. I have never been stranded on the side of the road for anything other than a flat tire and running out of gas, and even pushing 100,000 miles, it still runs like the first day I brought it home.

Another thing worth mentioning is the SPACE in this little car. Since the two-door is a hatchback, you fold the back seat down and the world can fit in this little car. We moved last year, and I fit everything that was in my kitchen (minus furniture) as well as all of my breakable items in the back of the car. I was impressed. Also, for those who enjot bike riding, two mountain bikes, strategically placed, will fit in the back as well.

My husband and I are looking to buy another car in the late summer or early fall - and we have decided that it will be another Accent - the four-door this time, because we know what to expect.<br><br>
