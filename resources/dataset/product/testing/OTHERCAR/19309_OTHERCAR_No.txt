            I bought this camera because I wanted an alternative to film where I wouldn't have the extra hassle of taking the film to get it developed and picking it up again and paying for it each time I take some pictures. I was also a really bad procrastinator so I'd often go several months before taking old rolls to get them developed.  With a digital camera I expected I would get instant results and be taking a lot more pictures since it cost me nothing to take them!  
Well, this camera does take very sharp pictures, they look beautiful, and the macro shots are amazing. I took a few pictures of my roses and other garden plants and they are good enough to put in a picture book and sell on amazon.com or something!  But, and this is a big BUT, the camera has a horrible problem with red-eye!  Every single picture I take with the flash has a red-eye problem. Everyone looks like a demon from hell, and its really starting to bother me.  I tried the red-eye reduction mode but that doesn't fix it.  I did some research into what causes red-eye and its related to the position of the flash and light reflecting back from the subject's retina.  Well I can't change the position of the flash, and even when the subject isn't look directly at the camera I still get red-eye.  I wonder if maybe I have a defective flash or something and its too bright? I've never heard of that...
But anyway, if you get this camera, be warned that you might only get to use it in bright daylight hours or for inanimate (or eye-less) objects.
