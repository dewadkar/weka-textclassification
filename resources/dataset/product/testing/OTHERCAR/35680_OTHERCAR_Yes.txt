            We bought this vehicle because the family car just wasn't big enough anymore, and didn't want to throw out $20,000 on an SUV. It has served us pretty well over the last few years, and has been a good all-around vehicle.
First let me talk about the space. This is much nicer than most minivans in that it IS somewhat possible for someone to sit in the back seats. There is about a 2 foot area in the back of the van for groceries and a spare tire. I find it much easier than other vehicles I have owned to fit stuff in. The middle and rear seats come out pretty easily, and it usually takes about 3 minutes for me and someone else to get them out. I average around 23 mpg, which is pretty normal, I guess.
Next, the features of this vehicle. Ours has ABS, air-bags (which were recently recalled because of safety matters), Power windows, power steering, A/C, cruise control, and a V-6. In other words, it is pretty much loaded. We got it from a family friend at a great discount ($5500 isn't bad). It has 80000 miles on it or so, and SO FAR nothing has gone majorly wrong. We did have the air conditioner break down, some strange smells coming out of the vents, and I am getting the feeling that the transmission is going to go in a couple thousand miles. That's really not bad for a vehicle from '94 with this many miles on it, though.
The handling is good for a mini-van, although it may not seem that great to you if you are used to cars. The driver's seat feels like the usual, a not-too-terribly-comfortable seat, but a great view of the road.
So I guess this van doesn't have the looks, power, or prestige of an SUV, but it gets the job done.<br><br>
