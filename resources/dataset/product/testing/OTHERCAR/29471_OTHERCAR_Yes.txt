            I will be completely honest with you.  I do not own a Jeep Wrangler but my friend does and I ride with him very often.  He has a brand new 1999 Jeep Wrangler Sport.  It has both hard and soft tops and it is a 4.0 liter.  The Wrangler is a very sporty <br>vehicle.  It uses a good amount of gas and it is not very roomy.  The ride is a little rough but what do you expect form a utility vehicle.  The seats are fairly comfortable for a long ride.  My friend has 15,000 miles on his but it has not gave him any trouble <br><br>yet.  Personally I do not believe that they are a very dependable vehicle.  It seems to me that you see a lot of them getting traded in at least around 100,000 miles.  Dependability is very important to me because I am getting ready to attend college <br><br>and I need a good reliable vehicle.  The engine on the Wrangler is what I would consider to be average in loudness.  The Wrangler does not handle real well either.  They have improved them over the years but lets face it they will never handle like a <br><br>sports car.  In the end the Wrangler is a good vehicle for someone looking for a sporty ride, but not those who intend to drive several people around or haul lots of items.  <br><br><br>
