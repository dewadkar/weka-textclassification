            The Acura 3.2 CL Type S (CL-S for short) is the kind of car that needs to be driven and compared, so make sure that after reading all about the CL-S here on Epinions, you go to your Acura dealer and actually drive one.  This is because the car is awesome on paper, but I find that in person it falls short from all the praises that this car gets from the press and their owners.  It's often compared to the BMW 330Ci, and yes on paper the CL-S looks like the better deal (better performance for a much lower price) but in reality, the BMW is so much superior...  Let's take a look:

<b>Exterior</b>
This is a matter of personal taste, but I find one word to describe the Acura CL-S:  Bland.  The style is not offensive: it just induces sleep.  It screams "I'm a Honda Accord Coupe!  You're paying more for me just because I have "Acura" written on me."  And if you know me, you know I don't like Hondas because well they are so conservatively styled and boring and low-quality.  But to give it some credit, the back styling is much improved from the previous generation which looked like the car's rear belonged on the front.  But still, the flat, slab-paneled body sides and the nondescript front fascia are proof that car makers don't care about bold and great styling in their cars anymore.  (Acura did have some great styling before: look at the NSX and Integra!)

The Sundance Gold color is very striking and eye-catching, but a bit odd on an Acura.  I like the dark blue (Monterey Blue Pearl) because it's sporty yet classy and appropriate for an Acura.  At least Acura doesn't charge extra for metallic paint, unlike most European brands (including BMW).

The Xenon HID headlights are very bright and unlike on a BMW, they are standard equipment (true for a lot of options:  The CL has almost everything standard equipment for which BMW nickels and dimes you.)

<b>Interior</b>
The interior is much better than an Accord Coupe's, as you'd expect.  The Type S model comes with perforated leather and white-faced gauges which feels a bit out of place in a car that feels to me more of a luxury car than a sports sedan.  I feel that the gauges are too "buried" into the dash that doesn't give them the visibility and intimacy that you expect with the information on the gauges that you need when driving fast.  But the perforated leather is very nice and the quality of the leather and interior plastic is surprisingly good.  It feels like a $50K car inside.

To me, this car feels very big (one reason why I didn't get it) and I felt "buried" in the car and it was hard to look out and see the end of the hood.  The front seats are very comfortable and almost infinitely adjustable, with supportive back and side bolsters.  Even so, I couldn't into a driving position that was both comfortable and safe-feeling (i.e. gave me maximum visiblity).  Acura definitely know how to make a luxury car...  The rear seats are spacious and comfortable, and will fit two decently-sized adults without a problem.  You can't squeeze 3 folks back there because there is a little flat center console that makes the rear seats strictly for two people.

The in-dash 6 CD changer is a very nice standard equipment:  You insert your CDs one by one through what looks like any ordinary single CD player, but it somehow stores them all in there.  The dash controls are very well designed and it has a clean look, like on a BMW, but the temperature controls are a bit too small and they are push-button type (because it's an automatic climate control system).  I much prefer big dials to control the temperature for ergonomic reasons.

The Navigation System (which is the only option for this car!) is impressive in that you interact with it via a touch screen, rather than with buttons (like on the BMW).  This is a step in the right direction in terms of usability of these Navigation Systems.  The screen also serves as the on-board computer that gives you vital stats about your car.

The trunk is refreshingly big, compared to the pathetic little space in the 330Ci.  You can easily put a big subwoofer box in there and still have room to spare.

<b>Visibility</b>
For me, visibility was a problem in this car.  The rear windows are hard to see out of while backing up, and because I felt "buried" in the car, I didn't feel too confident driving in this car as I had a hard time looking out in all directions.  It felt like I was driving my father's Buick; in more ways than one (see below).  The bottom of the window was literally at shoulder height, so you can imagine how uneasy I felt in the driver's seat.

<b>Drive</b>
Let's do the BMW 330Ci vs. Acura CL Type S shootout:  Finally, getting behind the wheel and on the road...  So on paper, the CL has 225hp/217lb-ft torque and the Type S, 260hp/232lb-ft torque.  Very impressive.  <i>CL wins</i>.  The BMW 330Ci pales in comparison... or does it?

First of all, you cannot get manual transmission on the CL-S.  There is a manumatic transmission with an open-gate (a la Jaguar) shifter, but I just can't get used to "tapping" the shifter to shift gears.  And I have a bias against auto shifters being on the floor: I can't stand them.  <i>330Ci wins</i>.

Second, the CL-S is a front-wheel drive car while the 330Ci is a rear-wheel drive car.  Although not as bad as some other cars, there is a bit of torque steer in the CL-S:  when you floor the gas pedal, the steering wheel tends to "tighten up" which is a characteristic of almost all front-wheel drive cars.  This may be a strange statement, but the car reminded me a lot of my father's Buick LeSabre.  There is power when you ask for it, but there is no soul.  The car just responds without complaint or drama or enthusiasm.  The BMW, however, sings and wails and loves it when you floor the gas pedal.  <i>330Ci wins</i>.  I didn't have a chance to drive the car to the limit due to road conditions, but on the turns it felt like the car didn't have any questionable under or oversteer or body lean.  Handling was pretty impressive with this car, given it's perceived bigger size (at least to me) compared to the 330Ci.  I expected it to wobble like a Buick, but it didn't.  So yes indeed, Acura has come a long way in competing with BMW's renowned handling characteristics.  <i>It's a tie</i>.

Third, this is something that can't really be quantified, but the CL-S does not feel as fun to drive as the 330Ci.  The fun factor.  I didn't see myself wanting to yell "whoo hoo" and grinning from driving the Acura, whereas I was happy as a puppy in the BMW.  The BMW just felt more nimble and fun to drive.  <i>330Ci wins</i>.

<b>Conclusion</b>
The Acura CL-S is a very value-oriented, options-packed luxury coupe that boasts incredible performance numbers at a sexy price.  While its handling is comparable to the BMW 330Ci, it is no where as fun to drive as the BMW and it's major flaws are bland exterior styling, bad visiblity, torque steer, and the lack of manual transmission as an option.

If I wanted massive horsepower for very little money, there is a thing called Camaro or Mustang.  If I wanted a luxurious coupe with some performance, then it's the Acura CL-S.  But if I wanted a fun sporty coupe with a side order of luxury, it's the BMW 330Ci, not the Acura CL-S.  "But alas, the price difference!" you say?  Which is why there is a thing called a BMW 325Ci, the car I ultimately chose; So I miss out on cool little options, but I was in the market for a sporty coupe, not a luxury car, so options and gadgets were not top priorities.

In sum, Acura still makes some of the best, under-appreciated, under-valued luxury cars for a great price (Lexus and Mercedes-Benz and BMW definitely overcharge you!).  The CL-S stays true to the Acura name and delivers the luxury, but it is a long way off from offering a fun, soulful car that it wants to be.
