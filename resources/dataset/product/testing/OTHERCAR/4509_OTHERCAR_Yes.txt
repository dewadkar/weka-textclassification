            I bought my 2-door Tercel DX from a family friend when I was 17, and in three years put 40,000 miles on it and not much money into it. When I acquired it, it had 60,000 miles on it and had been involved in one substantial accident (and had been fully repaired). When I had to give it up, it had 99,000 miles on it and had been in two more minor accidents, but still drove beautifully. I drove it to college and back several times a year (a 350 mile trip, one-way) as well as commuted an hour each way to work while I was home.
 
  In general, the car is not terribly powerful (4-cylinder engine) and has less than ideal pickup, but it flies once you get it above 55 mph. Until 75 mph or so, where the power seems to drain a bit from the steering to fuel the engine. Its steering is surprisingly sensitive, and brakes are perfectly adequate. Despite its light weight and my lack of winter driving experience, it handled pretty well in the snow. I can remember maneuvering past cars of all shapes and sizes scattered horizontally across the highway in PA during a particularly bad storm last year, expecting to spin out but never feeling it happen.

  Its compact size may be uncomfortable for those drivers used to driving bigger cars and those passengers who need lots of legroom in the back. However, I still managed to squeeze several friends back there without much complaint, and it still held enough of my belongings to get me up to school. The fold-down rear seats helped a lot; having a two-door model didn't.

The good points:
- absolutely terrific on gas
- easy to maneuver, pretty quick brake and steering response (especially reassuring for a new driver in city traffic)
- reasonably smooth ride
- sensible design, sturdy interior
- easy to care for

Problems? Few and far between, considering I knew next to nothing about car care and was pretty rough on the thing in my ignorance: 
- water pump failed around 70K, leaked coolant and overheated (but no warning light? I found that odd) - still, repair wasn't too expensive, and there was no head gasket damage (despite my idiot self driving around for several miles wondering what the green stuff leaking from my car was...)
- piston began misfiring some time after the last accident, in which I rear-ended another car; there didn't seem to be mechanical damage, but the impact may have had internal effects that I didn't notice right away. I drove it for a good 6 months after that until the engine started knocking because a spark plug had fallen out. Fixed the spark plug and kept driving it until I could replace the car. Noise and all, it still drove pretty well on my commute. However, I have heard of a few instances of serious engine problems around 100K with early 90s Tercels - not sure if it's a driver issue (which I'd definitely expect in my case) or a car issue.


Overall, this car is a great value, especially for students and other young car owners - fun, reliable, inexpensive, and durable.
