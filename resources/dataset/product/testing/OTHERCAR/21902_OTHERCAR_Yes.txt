            When I purchased my 2001 BMW 540i with the sport package that included the 6-speed manual transmission, I was sure that it was the best handling sedan I had ever driven.  The car absolutely rockets to 60 mph and has plenty of power at highway speeds, thanks to gobs of low-end torque and 282 hp provided by the 4.4 liter V-8.  This BMW is also the most comfortable I've driven.  The leather seats are supportive even during spirited driving maneuvers.  The navigation system and HK stereo are both great options, and the cold weather package is a must if you live in a cold climate, like New England.  After driving the other two 5-series models offered, I would have to say that the 525i is definitely underpowered, but the new 530i has a more potent in-line 6 that may be sufficient for most drivers.  However, the V-8 and 6-speed transmission do increase the fun factor significantly.  The slightly revised look of the 5-series for 2001 makes the pre-2001 models look outdated, especially the new projector headlamps with the illuminated rings.  Nonetheless, the 540i is The Ultimate Driving Machine.
