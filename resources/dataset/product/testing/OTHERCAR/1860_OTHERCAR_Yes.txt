            I've been driving my Defender for a couple of years now and figured I would pass on my experiences with this vehicle. 

Firstly although I am driving a 90 Defender, I am writing this from the UK where I am driving the more frugal 2.5TDi version of the vehicle. Fuel prices in the UK are high enough without having to feed an eternally thirsty V8. 

This is not my first Defender, my previous one was stolen and this is the vehicle I chose to replace it, my original one was the "van" body version which used the space behind the driver and the passenger entirely as load space. 

This model is the British "County 90" model, essentially a SWB version but a Defender nonetheless. 

The first thing that strikes you about the Defender when you climb into the driving position is..well, the driving position. The Defender gives you an impressive visibility all around despite the box like shape which I thought might lead to blind spots while manoeuvring.

A lot of my mileage at the moment is unfortunately on road, the Defender is an acquired taste when it comes to driving. The diesel engine in my model is sluggish but adequate enough to keep up with the nippier aspects of UK traffic. 

As you hit higher speeds you also pick up a fair deal of road noise, a lot of that is dependant on the tyres you are using, if you use a more road orientated pattern then you are going to have a quieter ride. 

Even with coil springs the 90 is always going to provide a choppier ride than it's bigger brother the 110.  Simply because of the short body and the revised distribution of weight, once again however it's more a case of taking things steady as you go. If you stick to this rule you will be fine. 

It's when you get to the off road scenario that the Defender clearly shines. It takes a lot to stop one of Land Rover's finest and the low revving diesel put together with the low ratio box will get you out of situations which would stop some other 4WD vehicles. 

It's not unstoppable though, but then no 4WD is and you have to approach driving such vehicles with care. Saying that though, I have successfully navigated through some pretty treacherous conditions including thick mud and fairly deep water. 

This is the kind of behaviour that the Defender excels at and it gives you an idea why it's on road manners are at times somewhat lacking. You can't always have the best of both worlds and to give the Defender it's sure footedness when the going gets tough you have to take away some of the on road comforts. 

Going back to the interior trim, it is indeed very sparse. A functional dash layout tells you just about what you need to know.  On the UK spec layout you get standard speedometer, fuel gauge and battery indicator. There is a two speed fan/heater which works pretty well even on those cold mornings, additional ventilation is available by raising the flaps under the windscreen via a couple of dash mounted handles. 

The seats are comfortable with good lumbar region support with the option of a third front seat to slot in between driver and main passenger, I've experience this with my previous Defender and it was in all honesty a pointless exercise, the gear shift got in the way. 

Mounted down in between the seats are the gearshift (5 speed H configuration box) and your additional controls for the 4WD mechanism. Here you have two short levers, one controlling the differential lock, the other allowing you to drop the vehicle ratio to help you out of those extra tricky situations. 

In the rear you have a four seat layout, not  particularly comfortable for long journeys if all the seats are occupied but not too bad as a mini people carrier. 

I've owned my Defender now for over two years, it's been pretty good motoring as far as I'm concerned and I'm in no rush to change it anytime soon. The only mechanical problems I've experienced were a spate of cracked fuel pipes, apart from that the vehicle has been fine. I've fitted larger tyres to my Defender (265 x 16 Bronco Mud/Snow Pattern) without problem and just done a little maintenance work on the locks as they started to feel a little vague.

The Defender as a whole is by no means perfect, it can be draughty and leaks a little in heavy rain but for the most presents itself as a fun driving experience. As long as you know that you aren't going to have the comforts of driving a Rolls Royce you should be fine.
