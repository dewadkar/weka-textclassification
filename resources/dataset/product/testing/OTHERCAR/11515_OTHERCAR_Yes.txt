            With the fairly recent redesign of the Maxima, Nissan has once again created a incredibly sporty car in a Toyota Camry type package.  The Nissan's jewel is its engine.  Its a smooth nice sounding V6 with 222hp.  Hooked up to a nice 5pd manual and you have a poor mans Bmw 5 series.  The Maxima excels at what it was designed to be.  A reliable affordable attractive sports sedan.  In base form its a great value... all decked out its a luxury sports sedan.  The Bose sound system is excellent and the seats are great.  The automatic shifts smoothly and the stick is easy and fun.  Back seat room is large and the quality of materials is above average.  The biggest issue people have with the maxima is its new styling.  To some its a bit radical or gaudy but put it next to a Pontiac and it looks classy.  If you are shopping for something like this car but hate its styling and don't need the sport aspect buy a Camry.  The one quabble I have with Nissan is its use of a solid rear axle in the back.  A sports sedan should not have the same rear suspension as a blazer.  Nissan has done a commendable job refining this suspension but its can never reach the same ride quality as those sedans using an independent setup.  One idea I have for Nissan is a V Spec maxima... output upped to 270hp revised shocks, springs and wheels and a independent rear suspension...(see mustang cobra formula)
