            Four years ago my wife insisted I get rid of my 10 year old Corolla, so I bought the next best thing, a 1997 Geo Prizm. This is really a Corolla with a "Geo" nameplate, although unfortunately now they are "Chevrolet" Prizm's which seems to cheapen the name! At the time there was a $1000 rebate on the car so I could get my car for a good $1500-2000 less than what a comparable Corolla down the street would have cost me. Plus the salesman at the Geo dealership somehow goofed up and gave me about $1000 *too much* on my 10 year old Corolla tradein! (I called back a week later to talk to my salesman and surprisingly enough he was no longer employed there!)

The car has held up impeccably in the past 4+ years, having needed nothing but old changes and the radiator flushed (I have only put 23,000 miles on it.) It's styling has also held the test of time compared to something like a Dodge Neon which was also selling at the time. It almost looks like a Lexus really! If I could find a Lexus decal that would fit perfectly on the oval Geo emblem I think I could fool some folks!

Unfortunately I have heard that Chevrolet is going to discontinue the Prizm after 2002. How sad.
