            I'm on my third one and finally broke down and got a 600. Let's just say there is nothing
                    like a V12. I actually chose this car over an F355 spider for a simple reason that it
                    allows for relaxed driving when you want it. Not a sports car per say but it beats the
                    non-turbo 911s. But the best thing about this car is there is nothing like it at all. There is
                    a convertible Bentley but it's no fun to drive even with that huge engine. Until the Z8
                    comes out (and with the way BMW dealers do business I will never buy one) this is the
                    only game in town. Can't go wrong with a Benz and can't look bad in an SL. <br><br>
