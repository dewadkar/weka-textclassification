            Had to wait almost 3 and half months for a silver 2001 EX model, but after 3 months with it, it sure was worth the wait.  Dealer sold it for MSRP, $26,800 and told me I'd have to wait 3 months for delivery.  I called other dealers, I could get immediate delivery but the premium was anywhere from 3 to 5 thousand dollars.  That said, the EX model with its auto sliding doors has been a pleasant surprise day in and day out.  

The 3.5 liter VTEC engine has lots of torque from 2000 rpm up and the 16 inch rims and Michelin tires have lots of grip and are quiet on the highway.  The automatic shifts very smoothly, almost imperceptibly from 2-3 and 3-4.  Full throttle takeoffs will hold the transmission in gear and allow almost redline shifts, providing a very peppy and sporty feel and sound.  The engine is smooth as buttah, at idle its quiet and vibration free, it can rev when the throttle is mashed though, but with all the torque available, this isn't really called for.  It can cruise naturally at 80 mph quietly and with no fuss, running at 2300 rpm and not much wind or road noise.  Even at 100 mph, it runs rock steady and not laboring at all, but wind noise gets a bit intrusive.  After a full midwest winter, the traction control and ABS have worked flawlessly.  The outward view is excellent and the side mirrors are big, offering a generous rear view in traffic.

The space inside is amazing, the only other comparison is to the Grand Caravan, but the Honda has way more features and is user intuitive and friendly at that.  It has dual zone climate control, I have not had reason to run the A/C but the heater warms up quite fast and with separate settings for the rear, no one complains of the cold.  
The seats in the EX feature a power driver seat and a neutral velour covering.  The power driver seat has as many adjustments as neccessary and is quite comfortable to this reviewer.  Lots of reading lights and cup holders all over the place, just where you expect them.  The seat coverings appear to be durable and grippy, no sliding around as on a leather surface.  The seating configurability has been a big bonus.  Within a few seconds you can flip forward the third row seats and the cargo space triples, take out the middle row seats and an 8 X 4 plywood sheet fits!  The Odyssey has a spacious interior feel, all that glass and headroom only improves the feeling.  The tinted windows are quite dark as is the norm these days.

Gas mileage has been about 18 in the city and 22-24 on the highway, not bad for such a large vehicle.  The manual says the gas tank is 20 gallons but I get the low fuel light after about 14-16 gallons, I think the calibration is off or just pessimistic, I think Honda fudges this and errs on the conservative side.  Above and beyond all the features and performance advantages I think the Odyssey has, the styling stays with me, it really sets it apart.  It has a sharp, creased style that is distinctive and sporty(if a minivan can be called that).  It looks sort of aero without being rounded like the Grand Caravan.  If they offer this in all wheel drive using the Acura MDX drivetrain (240 horsepower! and 4 wheel disc brakes)I would wait 6 months for that model.  Honda has leaked to its sales people that it will be offering it's own version of the MDX for about $5K less, but for me, just give me the MDX drivetrain and the space and utility of the Odyssey.  It is certainly worth every penny paid.
