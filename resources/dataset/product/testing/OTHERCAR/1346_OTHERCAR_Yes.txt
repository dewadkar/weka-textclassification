            I bought a Chevy Silverado In May of 1999. It is a 3 door ext. cab, Z71, 4X, step side with all the options, except leather. It is one sexy looking truck that will go anywhere, towing anything. I bought this truck because I was tired of breaking down in my Ford Ranger. I use the truck to work in, pick up the kids, and to do errands. I have driven 22,000 miles since May with not one problem. My grandfather, George King, worked for O'Rielly Chevrolet Motor Company for 30 years. Before he died he told me to never buy anything except a Chevy. He was 6' 5&quot; tall at 250 lbs. I did what he said. He knew what he was talking about. I named my truck, for what it is, in his honor. My license plate says &quot;THEKING&quot;<br><br>
