            The new Cadillac Escalade is great!  It is great for mothers, especially, since it has a special seat for the infant car seat.  It is sturdy, strong and provides a smooth ride in luxury.  Fully-loaded with the On-Star system, TV, VHS player, BOSE stereo system and much more, this vehicle is comfortable enough to live in.  I get so many compliments on the car and feel safe with their On-Star system which provides directions to restaurants, hotels, tickets to special events, road-side service and many more luxuries that Cadillac owners are privileged enough to have.  I recommend this SUV if you want to ride in style and luxury.<br><br>
