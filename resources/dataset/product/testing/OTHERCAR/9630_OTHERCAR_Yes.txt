            We bought our Tracker in 1997. It was a new 1996.Had about 80 miles on it.
It is a two door soft top.Had problems with it at first. Had a lot of rattles in the dash board and the speed ohmmeter arm started making a noise, had to be replaced. Had it in the shop about 6 times that first 6 months.After that everything was fine with it.It's a Great little car.Great in Summer,You can take the top off. In the Winter with snow,just put it in four wheel drive and go.No problem.
I've heard stories about them turning over easy.I've never had any problems.I did have a problem one time, we were coming home from a vacation last year and it was raining, we did try to hydroplane,but we got it under control,I guess it's because they are so light weight.
We have also found that now that it is almost four years old we are not getting as good gas milage.
There's not much room in them to haul things ,but I wouldn't give up my Tracker.Since that first year we haven't had to put it in the shop.<br><br>
