            I bought the 2001 Audi TT Quattro Coupe with the 225HP turbo and 6 speed manual transmission because I love sports cars.  In the last 3 years, I have owned or still own a BMW M3, three Porsches, and a Jaguar XJR.  The TT is not the fastest, is not the most comfortable, is not the best looking of the bunch.  But it is more fun to drive than anything I have ever owned.  Why?  Handling with a capital H.

I'm not sure just how fast you can turn a corner, because I have turned corners as fast as I want and have not discovered the limits of the car yet.  A Corvette will beat me in a quarter mile, but can't keep up on a road course.  The suspension and all-wheel drive is the key.  And the fact that it costs less than $40,000 for this kind of performance makes it a bargain.

The back seat is basically unusable, but I have more headroom than I had in my Jaguar sedan.  However, the small side windows hurt visibility.

The TT is a fun car that can take the misery out of commuting.  It is NOT a family car that is not practical for a family with a couple of kids, but if you can afford a fun car for yourself, this is it!<br><br>
