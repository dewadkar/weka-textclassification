            In April of 1996, my husband and I were in dire need of a good, reliable car. We wanted  to keep our car payment within a reasonable amount, so when we read about the '95 Intrepid in our weekly shopper for $9995., we thought we would check it out. Of course, we fell in love with the design and look of the car.  It was and ES model and having everything under the moon available on it.The one problem, it already had 90,000 miles on it.  We were very unsure about a car which was only 1 year old having so many miles on it already.  How was that even possible? We talked to the owner of the dealership, who is also a friend of my husband's, I'll add, to get his opinion. Well he said that it was a track/test car for Chrysler, which he thought was probably a good thing because it was constantly being gone over and things rated and replaced according to how well all parts were holding up. All of the service records were available for us and we could see for ourselves what all new parts had recently been put on. He thought it would be a reliable car and if in two years we still had it, we could bring it back in and he would give us what we paid for it towards the purchase of a new Dodge Vehicle.  The first mistake we made was even agreeing to buy the stupid thing and the second was not purchasing some type of warranty with it.  As soon as we got back to the dealership after our test drive, we noticed that the heater did not work.  Although it was April, when sometimes the weather starts to get warmer, we were still having snow storms.  We also had a 7 month old baby, therefore, it was imperative that we have a reliable source of heat in our car.  They said they would fix the problem and we could pick up the car the following day.  Well, the climate control worked for about a week before it decided it was going to quit again.  They told us it would cost us around $750.00.  What other choice did we have since the car had no warranty.  Shortly after this trauma, a sensor went out, something to do with the amount of fuel the car was getting.  This cost us $240.00.  Well, things just kept rolling downhill after this.  After owning the car for about a year, the climate control unit went out again.  This time in the summer so we had no air conditioning.  Instead of cool air, we had full blown heat raging out at us.  My husband located a refurbished parts dealer where we purchased another climate control unit.  Needless to say, it didn't take long before we started having problems again.  This time we paid $150.00 for it.  We even took it to another repair shop to make sure that the air conditioner didn't just need charged. Well, that solution would have just been too easy.  So, no, that was not the problem.  Well, 2 Christmases ago, was really the icing on the cake.  We were on our way to a family gathering when it left us stranded along the highway.  The whole electrical computer went out.  Needless to say, we had to have it towed to the dealer and have everything replaced.  
That price tag was approximately $4200.  Well, we decided to go ahead and trade it off since they said they would work with getting us a good deal on a new vehicle.  Well to say the least, they practically laughed us off of the lot.  We were livid.  After paying $361.00 a month for over 2 and a half years, we still owed $8500 on a $10,000. car.  We have yet to figure that one out.  We are not stupid people, I assure you, it just goes to show how smooth these car dealerships are at getting you to sign on the dotted line for these &quot;good deals&quot;.  Well, 6 more payments on this monster and we will be Dodge free.  I don't want to come across as being a Dodge basher, because I'm not, I just think we got ahold of a lemon.  I'm sure that no matter what brand of vehicle you choose, there is going to be someone who feels the same negative way that we do about this.  And I'm not saying we'll never own another Dodge, we just need to be a little more cautious the next time. As with any product, some consumers will absolutely love it and others will hate it.  Sadly, with this particular one, we hate it. I don't want to say that all Intrepid's are junk, I'm just wanting to warn everyone of all the unfortunate possibilities.  Our car jerks around and spurts and sputters like it's on its last leg.  Our check engine light will not go off, our break lights are on, even when the breaks are not, our hazard lights come on at random and sometimes when you put it in drive, you get the thrill of being thrown in to reverse instead.  And we're the ones driving 2 small children around in this heap.  I just pray that Heaven is watching this car until December.<br><br>
