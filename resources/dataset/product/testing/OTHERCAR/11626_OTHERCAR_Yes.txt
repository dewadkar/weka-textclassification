             We originally purchased our 1994 Suburban for my wife. She is a teacher (choir) and we travel a great deal (especially with kids). The Suburban we have has the &quot;silverado&quot; package on it. Deluxe leather seats front and rear heat and a/c, and a good am/fm stereo with cassette. The tinted windows are a blessing here in Texas. My truck died and my wife gave up &quot;my &quot;suburban. It has been fun ever since.I can haul  equipment  and still be in luxury. My kids love the air and having their own doors.Elegant and hard working, all in one package.No wonder the Suburban is The National Car of Texas.<br><br>
