            I have owned a Jeep for 2 years.  I received a 1991 Jeep Cherokee Wagoneer (regular Cherokee body, just with wood panelling) for my 17th birthday.  As a first time driver, all I wanted to do when I got my license was to DRIVE!!!  I was up and down the East coast like it was my job.  I had gotten the car used, obviously, with about 60,000 miles on it.Today, with only a little work done (brake pads, tune-ups, regular wear and tear stuff) and another 50,000 miles in 2 years, Woody is still going.  This car has been through hell, offroading in Vermont, beach cruising in Florida, snow storms at school up in Mass and never a single whine.  My uncle has a 1995 Cherokee with a little over 160,000 to date.  He says the same thing.  The car does not ride as smoothly as many other SUV's, but Jeeps are know for a more bumpy ride.  I have seriously abused this vehicle, and even on the coldest winter morning, she starts up with a purr.  It does take quite a bit of time to actually get heated up, but that is not so unusual for older cars.  I would recommend a Cherokee to anyone.<br><br>
