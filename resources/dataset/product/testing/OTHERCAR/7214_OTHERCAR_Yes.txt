            Cast a thought back to the mid- to late-1960s North American auto scene, when the term &quot;pony car&quot; applied essentially to just five vehicles: Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro/Pontiac Firebird, AMC Javelin and Mercury Cougar.History records that the Camaro and Mustang more or less maintained their sporty flavours, and generally went on to dominate the pony car market.With the demise of American Motors, the Javelin passed too soon into automotive history, while the Cougar festooned ungracefully into a state of irrelevance and bloated excess, growing heavy, slow, ponderous and sporting tacky fashions-of-the-day like vinyl roofs, opera windows and glued-on leather trunk straps. It became a virtual cartoon on wheels.The original '67 model was to many a thing of beauty and agility � a genuine alternative to the competition. A brief decade later, a group of my friends referred none-too-kindly to another pal's emerald '77 Cougar land lounge as &quot;the Green Latrine.&quot;Mercury performed a largely successful revival of the nameplate in '89, but it remained less than a sports car and was pulled from the market about a year ago, some thought never to be heard from again. But the name is too valuable to be allowed to languish for long . . .The Cougar is reborn for 1999, I am pleased to report, and lovers of the coupe's once purposeful form can again rejoice. The new Cougar has never been truer to its original concept, blending drop-dead original good looks, spirited performance, lithe and intuitive handling and room for four adults in a handsome and well-appointed cabin with front and optional side airbags � the first Ford product to do so. The rear seats offer reasonable head room for six-footers, who themselves will require only a modicum of agility to get into and out from the rear space.Cloaked in perhaps the most avant-garde rendering yet of Ford's New Edge design philosophy, Cougar's curved angles intersect sharp lines creating geometric flair that's unique and appealing to this reviewer's eyes. The new Cougar cuts a dashing figure that Ford expects will appeal equally to both men and women (the first unisex car?) � wheels are pushed out to the corners and from all viewing angles the wedge design stands out boldly. &quot;It's more than just a fashion statement,&quot; said Mark Jennings, Cougar brand manager. &quot;We've got more stuff and a better price.&quot;The base 4-cylinder model, available only as a 5-speed, was due in Canadian showrooms early May with a sticker price of $19,995. The V6 starts at $21,795 and rises to $24,295 when optional sport and convenience equipment packages are added.Mercury is targetting one of the toughest buyer segments � one, frankly, that it hasn't had much experience at dealing with in recent years: younger drivers with active lifestyles. Cougar designer Gary Braddock defines such buyers as not loyal to any brand, who go for the boldest design available at any given time. Mercury also wants to appeal to buyers on both sides of the Atlantic, and will make the curvy hatchback available in Europe as well as in North America, offering such accessories as ski and snowboard racks to complement the car's generous trunk space.Whether it's the base 2.0-litre four or optional 2.5-litre sixcylinder Duratec engine driving the front wheels, performance is assertive, though not over-stated. The 125-hp, 16-valve 4-banger with variable camshaft timing feels a bit thrashy when revved to its redline, but pulls well nonetheless. Power brokers with a few more grand to spend will opt for the Canadian-built 170-hp V6 with its smoother power delivery and greater low-end torque.The Cougar is based on the well-sorted Contour/Mystique/Mondeo platform, and inherits its low friction steering and front strut design, with added refinement to match the new car's more sporty character. Chassis fine-tuning helps build driver confidence by removing any &quot;nervous&quot; traits inherent in the platform and enhancing the driver's ability to control the car's direction and attitude. The Quadralink rear suspension is similarly designed to be forgiving of driver indiscretions, engineered to dial out rear-end breakaway (ie. lift-throttle oversteer) to boost stability in extreme situations.Suspension is tuned to hold the corners � turn-in is quick and direct, and handling is almost visceral in its response to inputs. The ride is on the firm side without being stiff, and suspension compliance soaks up bumps and potholes without upsetting the car's balance.While it carries over 70 percent of its parts from the Contour/Mystique bin, Cougar's personality is quite different from either of its siblings. The driver sits 40 mm closer to the ground and the body is 18 percent stiffer, even with the large rear hatch. Spring rates are 20 percent stiffer in the front and 30 percent stiffer in the rear.The V6 package includes a brake force distribution system to reduce braking to the rear wheels before the anti-lock braking system cuts in, to maximize braking efficiency. Hustling a variety of 4- and 6-cylinder Cougars in both manual and automatic livery around the Road Atlanta racetrack, the car felt nicely balanced; even under hard braking, the ABS displayed a high threshold before making its presence felt.Officials say there are no plans at this time to offer an SVT or performance version of the Cougar, but it seems to me that such a car would be a natural in these days of tarted-up Civics, Accords, Eagle Talons and Golfs. It's easy to picture in one's mind this Cougar lowered further, with flared fenders angling over wider wheels and lower-profile tires, a basket-handle rear wing . . . and a loud 'n' throaty, drain-pipe exhaust sticking out the back.Even in its unaltered, original state, however, the Cougar should hold wide appeal for anyone who likes to stand out in a crowd. <br><br>
