            I used to always see and envy the people driving the Plymouth Voyager on the road.  I love the sporty look and heard some great reviews on it.  After finally getting myself one, my family and I loved it! I loved to go shopping since the van is so roomy to hold all my packages, my daughter loves it since she can bring all her toys to play with it, and my husband uses it to deliver/transfer computers systems.  After using it for about a year, the van was beginning to be a nightmare.  While at work, my van was parked in secured parking lot and was broken into from the back door.  They used a small screwdriver to drive my van off the lot.  The Police found it abandoned in a tow away zone the following morning without any seats in the van, busted lights, dented bumpers, and soiled cigarette burns on the carpet.  Fortunately, my husband was able to drive it off, using the same screwdriver.  Insurance didn't cover everything.  I now have different color seats to sit on, but at least I got something to sit on.  Engine and A/C all seemed fine.  Until 6 months later, my breaks started making noises, my reverse wouldn't go in reverse after 10 mins of warming up the car, my battery died, one tire got a bubble, heater is out, and a/c compressor is dead.  I don't have extended warranty because I presummed it to be a very stable and reliable van.  Since the problems with the van, I have ran into people with similiar problems.  Therefore, I do not recommend the van to anyone at all.  I shouldn't be paying for major engine work since it's been only 2 years, nor can I afford it.  I had influenced 3 of my family members to purchase one and they all fear the  problems.  The company should have better car maintenance package.<br><br>
