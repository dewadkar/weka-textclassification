                Our close friends have a dodge intrepid and i envy them so. Its luxurious comfort and smooth ride had me hooked from day one.   The entire design of the car is just so comfortable.  They have a super nice audio system, nice interior, adequate and accurate driving devices, and a big plus is its great for families.
   Not only will you be pleased by the performance of this ride but you will rest assured knowing your family rides along safely and smoothly.  The car is roomy and handles quite well at high speeds and sharp turns.  Accerleration is on top as well. The back seat is huge and the trunk is spacious as well.   
   Dodge is such an impressive company to me.  Their vehicles are constantly breaking onto new frontiers with new designs and new saftey features, all done while maintaining style, comfort and reasonable prices.
   If your looking and considering dodge,  this would be an strongly encouraged purchase.<br><br>
