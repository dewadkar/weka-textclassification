            The original reason I leased my 1998 Toyota Corolla LE was the no money down, first payment and I drive off the lot deal.  I also was impressed with my sales person, she did not show me the vanity mirror, and did not treat me like a kid.  This is my first &quot;brand new&quot; car.

I have been impressed with this car from day 1.  I have not had any problems thus far - granted it only has like 25k miles, but I have only had to replace a hubcap (my fault) and oil changes, windshield wipers etc.  My car is extremely quiet, even when I bring it up to 80mph on the highway.  It is quite peppy for a four cyl.  (I have a 5-spd manual transmission model)  

My only complaints are that it is on the small side, even with the wood-trim interior the interior is kind of plain, and the factory sound system could be upgraded.

I would consider keeping the car at the end of my lease, but I am making more $$ now, and I want a bigger car.  

I would recommend this car to any first time new car buyer, and anyone who wants a very reliable car for not a lot of cash!
