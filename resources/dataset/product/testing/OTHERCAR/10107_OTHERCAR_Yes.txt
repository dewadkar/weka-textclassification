            We originally bought this car because it was a good deal. We did not set out to purchase a Sable, but it had all the features and the price was right. After purchasing the car, we know we made the right choice. The car drives nicely and has excellent pick when merging into traffic. There is a couple odd things about the car that I have also noticed on other Sables. When the engine is idling it makes a rough rattling noise. I thought that the dealership was able to fix it by tightening up the exhaust system, but a month later it returned. The air vents in the dash make a irritating noise when the blower is on low. We have decided to live with it since the repairs costs could be very high for something minor. Normally we get from 20 to 24 mpg. That is good considering the size of the engine and size of the car.  I would recommend this car to any family. Just make sure you keep your kids in the back seat if you are unable to turn off the passenger airbag. If you ever have a large item you need to transport the back seats conveniently fold down. Also be warned that if you try to install a CD player part of the radio is in the truck. Know what you are doing before you get started. <br><br>
