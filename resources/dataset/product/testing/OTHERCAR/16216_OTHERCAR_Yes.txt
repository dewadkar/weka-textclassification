            I traded a '95 Lexus GS300 for a '95 Aurora almost a year ago with no regrets.  The GS was a superb auto, but pretentious.  The Olds falls short in overall quality but excells in seat of the pants driving enjoyment. The V-8 is great and I even get 25MPG on the highway.  The front feels cramped in comparison especially elbow room width, leg length, and headroom. I wish it had the GS's telescoping steering column. The rear seating is huge - great for customers. I regularly here from passengers: What kind of car is this? Non-enthusiasts never guess that it is an Olds. One of the best things about the car is that you can enjoy all of its features and performance, yet it doesn't stand out in a parking lot, like the Lexus does, inviting the wrong kind of attention.  I have always been a used car guy, I would not have enjoyed this car nearly as much If I had paid a lot for it, I picked mine up after being cosmetically abused by its prior owner but showing only 51k miles.  While I am sure some customers have suffered from GM build quality problems, mine has been mechanically trouble free so far,(as I knock on my wooden desk)except for a stumble in the 40-50 MPH range that so far has eluded diagnosis, or the dealer wishes not to deal with... yet.  Advice - Buy an extended warranty, this car has lots of extras that could cause headaches.<br><br>
