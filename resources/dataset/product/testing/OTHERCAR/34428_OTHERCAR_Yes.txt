            The buying experience was great, once I found the right dealer. I was looking for a "Silver-Blue Special" (a promotion Saturn was running in June 2002) and went to a couple of Saturn dealers in the Orlando area. These dealers had the $9995 Silver-Blue Special but tacked on $1500 in dealer add-ons even after they ran an ad in the paper that said "$9995 plus tax, tag and dealer fee", there was not an " * " explaining dealer add-on options. I just about gave up on Saturn, deciding they were a "bait and switch" company, when I called the Saturn dealer in Daytona Beach.
Yes, they had the Silver-Blue special for $9995 plus tax, tag  and dealer fee, NO DEALER ADD-ON OPTIONS, so I bought the car from them, cash. I've bought 4 new cars in my life and this was the best experience by far. I highly recommend the buying process, but not the "bait and switch" dealers in Orlando.
The car is an "SL" painted Silver-Blue with manual transmission, AM-FM stereo and air conditioning.  It is a four door and rated at 40 mpg. A decent little car but it only gets 40 mpg if you drive 60 mph with the ac off. But I didn't expect that it would get 40 mpg at 80 mph with the ac on. Under those conditiions it gets about 30-35 mpg, which is good. My full sized pickup gets 16 mpg under those conditions. This car is what it is: a small econo-box that is inexpensive to buy and gets good mileage. Which is what I bought it for because I commute 150 miles a day to and fro.
It is somewhat noisey with road, drive train and front end noise. The manual transmission is somewhat rough getting into the various gears but acceptable. It has decent power for a little car and cruises at 80 mph with no problem. The drivers seat is somewhat uncomfortable on drives of 30 minutes or more but otherwise good. It appears to have a larger turning radius than my full size pickup but this hasn't presented a problem yet. We will see about the rest the longer I own it since I've only had it 2 weeks.

UPDATE: Now that I've had the car for 2 1/2 months and 10,000 miles I have some more to say. The mileage gets better, I now get about 41 mpg strictly highway and about 30 mpg city, both of these are with A/C. The turning radius can be a problem, this car does't turn on a dime. This is a car that you learn to love, a little like a VW Beetle in this department. It's fun to drive and even has pretty good performance if you get on it. It handles something like a sports-car although the suspension could be a tad stiffer, bigger tires and stiffer shocks may help but it will be 60,000 more miles before I know. I had to make an emergency stop on the freeway and I didn't see anyway to avoid an accident but this little car did exactly what I needed it to do and didn't lock-up the brakes even though I didn't get the anti-lock option. This car very-well may have saved my life so it's easy to understand my growing affection for it.
