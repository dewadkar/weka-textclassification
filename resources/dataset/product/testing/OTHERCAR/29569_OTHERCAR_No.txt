            Being limited on the amount of cash available to spend on a digital camera, the price on the Vivitar 2700 convinced me that this is what a beginner needed to begin digital photography.  The camera is lightweight and easy to use, however every time you want to use it, you need to use new batteries because even when the camera is in the off mode, it somehow drains them.  I replaced the first camera, because the design on the battery door is of poor quality.  The door literally cracked in half from the pressure of closing the door to hold the batteries inside.  I returned the camera to the store in which I bought it, and they exchanged it for a new one, only to have the same thing happen months later to the new one.

Uploading your photo's to the computer is easy, and doesn't take great skill to learn how to manipulate.  The quality of the picture has a lot to be desired.  The resolution in this camera is far inferior to others on the market, but it if you aren't looking for great quality, you will enjoy it.

My advise to beginners is to invest a little more money and buy something that is going to suit all of your needs.<br><br>
