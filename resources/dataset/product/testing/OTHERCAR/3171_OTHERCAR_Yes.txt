            The first hot rod I ever drove was a '66 427 Vette.  Unfortunately my dad sold it when I was still pretty young.  The next car to come was another corvettte that we bought new in '85.  I had the 85 all through high school and definitely ran it hard and showed it no remorse.  My dad of course hasn't let me get a fast car until now.  My first choice obviously being the vette, the padres wouldn't go for it.  I wanted something fast and thought that the turbocharged rice rockets (ie: 300ZX, 3000GT, Supra) but then I decided I wnted a muscle car.  I was lookin at first gen Camaros and realized that I couldn't afford a nice one, and the one I could afford would be underpowered and constantly in need of TLC.  Also, the older Camaros just didn't have the comfort and handling.  Forcing myself to get over the stigma of the mullet making the camaro popular (or vice versa), I finally decided to test drive a newer one.  THe one I test drove had an aftermarket exhaust, low miles and all of the options.  Let me say when I hit seventy in third gear w/ the roar of the exhaust filling the car I was immediately hooked.  After spending some time looking at other newer camaros I bought it.  Black on Black leather, Hurst shifter, six speed.  It is the nicest car that I personally have ever owned.  The only bad things about the car are the oil leak at the back of the intake manifold (pretty common on the LT1 Z28's) and The driver side window that seems to have frequent problems.  I have had no other problem with the car than that.  I drove it ten hours to montana and was very impressed by how comfortable it was.  It handles about as good as the '85 and is quite a deal faster from 80mph.  I never dared venture past 115mph in the corvette but the Camaro jumped to 140 without skippin' a beat.  This car is fun to drive, looks good and for the most part is trouble free.  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking for something fast, cheap, and sporty.
