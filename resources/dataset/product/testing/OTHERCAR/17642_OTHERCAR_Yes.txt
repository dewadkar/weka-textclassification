            This car was a half impulse, half thoughtful buy. We (my husband who is 6ft tall) and I were intent on buying a Saturn. However our intent was to buy a WAGON. We have plans for the pitter-patter of little feets and the wagon seemed right up the familial alley.
So we go there to the "no pressure" dealership.. and ya know what... they DON'T pressure you! It was wonderful. I would have to say that is the best part of owning a Saturn for us anyway, is the service. We looked at the wagon in all it's glory. It was nothing to be ashamed of that is for sure. Then in the corner of my eye I saw this cute little coupe. The SC. We took it for a spin and my husband could tell I wanted it. I had only had my license for about 6 months so it was all VERY exciting to me! We went back after the test drive and sat down and figured out that we wanted all the goodies of the SC-2, but we HATE leather seats (leather and heat are not a good combo, and we're in Southern California) so they managed to find us a perfect combination of options. We basically have an pseudo SC-2 with just the difference in the seats. We got the sunroof (We will never own a car without one now) and every other power option available. The third door is EXTREMELY handy. The reason why its handy is one of the SC's downfalls, it lacks in space. The trunk hinges wont allow you to put much of anything of height in the trunk, but you can put the seats down in a 60/40 split so that helps. It has several other thoughtful little things. The rear seats have an odd feel to them. Your hind end sits much lower than your knees, and while this may feel not as natural as a regular seat, it keeps the rear passengers from "submarining" under the front seats in an accident. There isn't alot of space in the back, but we easily fit a HUGE monitor box into the backseat by way of using that 3rd door. The rear seats also have seatbelts complete with little seat belt clips hiding out behind the seats that keep the belts at a more comfy level for smaller people. The general size of the car isn't suitable for anyone over 6ft in my opinion. My husband complains all the time that its too small for him, and its hard to get in and out of (its sits fairly low to the ground). The dashboard gauges and radio/climate dials are easy enough to use. The sound system in mine is awesome for a factory installed one! 
My one big gripe for Saturn (and they are always willing to listen to their customers, trying to improve the cars) is that the headlights are horrendous. They are so far inset into the front of the car, that when you turn the car at night, you literally cannot see where you are going. It makes for a VERY NARROW feild of vision!
After I added the bra to the car I was asked at least 10 times "What kind of car IS that?" because you really cant tell... it looks somewhat like a Camaro that someone ran in the dryer too long and it shrunk. People were suprised when I told them a Saturn. 
The gas mileage is wonderful. We made it from the border of California/Oregon to the border of Oregon/Washington on one tank of gas. Its no pooch either, it can go if you want it to. Not enough to get you in trouble, but enough to get you there eventually. 
I drove a 1988 Buick Century prior to buying the Saturn. My insurance went DOWN after I got the Saturn. I was told because of the safety features. Whatever the reason was, I was pleased with that too.
The other thing... (I cannot say if this is true for all customers in all dealerships) they wash your car for you whenever you want. Sure you might have to wait around for 15 minutes to a half hour, but heck, its FREE!!!
