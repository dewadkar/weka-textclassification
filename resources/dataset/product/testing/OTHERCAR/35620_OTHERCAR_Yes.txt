            Father bought a 1998 malibu ls.
Great car.  fully loaded from pwr seats to mirrors, locks, keyless entry, map lights, cd/tape player full climate control, abs, fog lights, loud horn, everything you need for guages.  
the only option missing is the trac control.  This car runs very quietly and handles well even during heavy exceleration.  excellent shifting, and well controlled ride make it a very comfortable riding car.  excellent to take trips in.  roomy both in the front and back.  the trunk has enough room to store your luggage in also.  I personally like larger cars but if you are looking at a camry or accord, this is a great competition to the two.  It went into the shop once to have the front brakes and rotars redone under a bulletin (not a recall) and the front suspension had to be replace because there was a squeek in it (another bulletin) the car was purchased in 1997, the 1998 model line up was the 2nd year of production and later in 98 they had all the kinks ironed out.  the gas milage is good too.  the headlights light up the road well at night and it is easy to back up with few blind spots.  the trunk or hood is not an obstacle.<br><br>
