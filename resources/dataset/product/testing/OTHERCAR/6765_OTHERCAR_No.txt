            Having been given this vehicle as a work vehicle, and driven it over 6,000 miles, I must comment on the pros and cons of such a large pick-up.

Granted, I received the vehicle with 267,000+ miles, but it has been well maintained.  This is a heavy duty vehicle with the Cummins Turbo Diesel engine, and is well equipped with air, power steering, tilt, cruise control, and cassette.  It is equipped like most passenger cars are these days, and in theory, it could be used as a everyday commuter vehicle, but it is designed to work.

First off, the standard seats look comfortable, finished in a durable cloth, with individually reclining seat backs, but the lack of the space in the cab means that you cannot recline them more than about 20 degrees, meaning you are sitting up right most of the time.  Granted, I'm sure that there is more space in the extended cab version, but with a vehicle this large, I would expect a little more interior room, as my old Ranger extended cab was a lot more roomier in both foot room and seat back angle.  The seats are fine as long as the trip is under 200 miles, but anything longer and your hips and legs will start to give you cramps.  This may also be the result of having such a heavy duty suspension and a choppy ride when it is unloaded, but even with six car engines in the bed, the ride is not that much smoother.

With the Cummins Turbo Diesel, don't expect to burn rubber from stop lights, as such is the nature with a diesel engine.  Acceleration is painfully slow and the throttle pedal is stiff to operate.  You will send plenty of time with your foot on the floor just keeping up with traffic.  Once up to speed on the highway, you can cruise at decent speeds.  The constant drone of the diesel is always present at any speed, resulting in turning up the radio to try to drown out the constant din of the engine.  The automatic overdrive transmission does shift smoothly though.  Fuel economy is good for this size vehicle, with the average being 18 mpg on the highway.

The dual rear wheels combined with the extended fenders does pose some problems in themselves.  It is impossible to use the drive up windows at many banks as it is too wide to fit between the poles to these windows.  Also with the long wheelbase, parking and making sharp turns presents other challenges.

This vehicle is equipped with anti lock on the rear wheels, but on this particular vehicle, the module has been replaced twice and the failure rate is high on this part.  for those reasons, the feature is disabled, and a piece of electrical tape takes care of the warning light on the dash.  I received this vehicle with warped brake rotors, so badly so that the whole vehicle shook violently when ever the brakes were applied.  A replacement of rotors and new pads cured the shakes.

But the major problem seems to be electrical gremlins throughout the vehicle.  The A/C blower sometimes works right, and sometimes don't.  Jiggling the switch will usually get full fan speed.  The power mirrors are now such that they will adjust outward, but not inward.  The intermittent wipers sometimes do not work, and sometimes work fine, and the power door locks have the same feature, working only occassionally.  The power windows on the drivers side will go down about a 1/4 of the way, then stop, until you power them up a little, whereby they will then go down all the way.  The air conditioning works decently for a little while and then just seems to keep the humidity at bay without actually getting the cab any cooler.

I have driven a Ford F-350 diesel of two years newer (1994) with about the same mileage, and in comparison to this Dodge it is superior in every way.  The turbo diesel in the Dodge is reliable but has a tendency to leak oil.

I realize that this is a heavy duty vehicle, so one cannot expect the ride and comfort of a passenger car, but in comparison to a Ford of the same payload capacity, this Dodge is not even in the same league.
