            Last year I decided I needed a digital camera in order to sell on eBay - an online auction house.  We didn't want to spend a lot of money - but we wanted a camera that was easy to use, took great, clear pictures, and could came highly recommended.  We read several reviews in consumer magazines and online, and decided upon the Kodak DC210 plus.  It is wonderful!  The pictures are crystal clear - and we don't even have it set on the highest resolution!  At $499 (1999 price) it was in the lower range as digital cameras go.  It is very simple to use - three settings allow for taking the picture, seeing the pictures on the camera, and sending them to your PC.  I've had several eBay buyers ask what camera we have as the pictures are of the best quality.  We also send pictures of our daughter across the miles online to family on the opposite coast.  They love being able to see what is going on in her life without having to wait for developing and mailing the regular pictures - and they can print these out at home!  The only negative thing I can say about this camera is that if the lighting is too dark or too light, it can be tough to get the flash setting correct - but this has only happened once or twice - the majority of the pictures are fabulous!  <br><br>
