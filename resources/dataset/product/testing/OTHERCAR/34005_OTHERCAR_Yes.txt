            I will edit this review as corrections are needed. 


PROS:
I am original owner of a loaded 4X4 96 Tacoma,Xcab...primary reason for this purchase is
to have a great vehicle on slick winter roads during
Indiana winters...it has definitely proved itself for this
use...and it makes a great yard-mule for pulling garden
sheds around the back yard..if you installed a class 3
hitch!
overall I do not regret buying this compact pickup...have owned it for 6  years with zero mechanical problems...only defects from factory were:defective brake warning light...cigarette 
lighter inoperative....for $23,300.00 that ticked me off!....cup holder is finally off center dash and better on floor...this truck is worth the purchase just for the V6 engine and overdrive transmission!!!!..terrific
climate control will freeze or heat you out!!! = )...the blower
	blast air out great on high!...recommend cloth bucket seats
	only because this truck is so narrow that a 6O/4O bench
	seat is pointless!...no one can sit in the middle anyhow...
	cloth seats don't get too hot or too cold like vinyl does...this truck is great in the snow as long as the snow is under 6 inches deep...I have a economical snowplow
on mine called:SnowBear Personal Snowplow ...made buy a
company in Canada...Snowbear personal snowplow cost me
about $1,1OO.OO ...their website is
  http://www.snowbear.com
..you can buy one online at their website...if you buy one
you will like it...I like my Snowbear personal snowplow = )



CONS:
(1)Paint peels off the aluminum-wheel plastic center caps
by 3rd year....Chevy-Silverado has better wheel center-caps. (2)Variable windshield wiper control is
worthless because control range is too short. (3) Bed will sage down with a full 55 gallon kerosene	can in it:that's pathetic!...rear suspension stinks for hauling. (4)Horn stopped working after 3 years...
horn sounds like a wimpy old 195O VW beetle is coming! (5)I wish toyota would get a clue and make the inner bed out of solid stainless steel thats thick mil like the Chevy silverado has!? (6)Spare tire winch cable does 
not go all the way to the ground...my old Nissans Hardbody's
did.(6)cruise control is great overall but it accelerates to hard	and fast if you hold it up for too many seconds. 
(7)Overall I love the the cruise control design...I think it's a better design than the one thats in my mother's 87 Volvo sedan because the	Tacoma cruise control allows precise up/down adjustment in my Toyota truck...I wish Tacoma cruise control accelerated smooth and gradual through the entire rpm range..a trivial dissapointment. 
(8)6O/4O bench seat is too firm and you can't be comfortable while driving...I wish backrest was flat and
	not curved. (10)Wish gas tank was 5-1O gallons larger.	(11)Glove box door is noticibly warped at top edge...glove box door never closes flat. (12)I refuse to give my 1996 a 5/5 because of the wimpy rear suspension and easily dented bed metal...they might have put thinner metal in for reduced 	vehicle weight???...profit??? (13)Mine has tilt steering and I would have purchased a telescopic steering option in a heartbeat.(14)Door speakers cannot handle maximum base setting without distorting. (15)Heated seats would be a nice option but Toyota does not offer them?...Volvo does. (16)On/off knob on the Cassette indash reciever cracked off after 6th year of ownership....will
scour salvage yards for another on/off reciever knob.
(17)Indash
factory installed stereo-reciever lacks auto-scan which
would allow you to automatically program channels
2 fm banks/1 am bank ....by pressing one button....the
button usually has the letters "PS" for Program Scan or
"AS" Auto Scan.
(18)Cassette-stereo on/off-knob broke off on this 96
as of:Aug 2003. (19)Rear 4x4 leaf springs sag bad...
factory rear spring are worthless.....
go to shopping.yahoo.com   and order Hellwig helper springs.

.........epinions is great!!!!
.....................................ps...........
I wish epinions would add "money-making-opportunities"
too the personal finance section...I know I would visit
this website alot more often if they did = )


maintenence update:month of May 2003: air conditioning
stopped working....still blows air but but zero cool...
...I'll keep yall posted...might be just a fuse.
...Horn stopped working also....horns been trouble
since day one.
