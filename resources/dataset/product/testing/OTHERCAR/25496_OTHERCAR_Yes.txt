              I was ready for a new car.  My old on was not that old and did not have that many miles on it, a ford with only 50K but MANY problems.
  I had heard and read about Saturns and a friend knew someone who worked at the dealership.  I was comfortable in the car and the price is right.  That was 6 months ago.
  This is a pre-owned car but was/is low mileage and well maintained.  I have not had problem one out of it and love it!  There could be a bit more padding in the seat, but my seat has enough padding to make up for that!  The car drives fine, has good acceleration, handles well, the a/c blows cold, the heater HEATS.
  The sealing factor was this:  Shortly after I purchased this car I was side swiped.  This fellow went up the entire side of my car.  I was in tears thinking the side of my new car was now bashed in.
  Right before I got out to examine the damage I heard some popping noises.  The places of impact just popped right out! The only sign that I had just been hit were some scuffs on the plaster bumper!
  Most any other car would have been crushed up the side.  My Saturn still looks like new and I am now a die hard Saturn devotee.
