            I purchased my 2000 Civic EX just a month ago.  I've had Domestic cars for my last three vehicles and have nothing but problems with each of them within the first 30 days of ownership. However, with the Civic, thank goodness, it runs like a charm!  I had a comparable Ford Probe, and space wise, the Civic seems to afford more space for the taller members of my family, both in the front and in the rear.  I didn't purchase the car for this reason, but it sure was nice to hear from those who have ridden in it that it is comfortable and easy to get into and out of.

The gas mileage is great, about 375 miles on an 11 gallon tank. Compared to the Ford Probe, which, for me, only got about 250.  I drive both highway and surface streets everyday.  So, if you are looking for a vehicle that is reliable and economical, this would be one of the best buys for you!

The ride is smooth, and it handles like it is on rails.  The steering is sensitive enough to respond to the slightest motion, but not so much so that it would be easy to loose control.

Overall, this is a great car.  Great for college students and families alike!<br><br>
