            Not to put a burr under anyone, but the whole idea of writing epinions on Ferrari's is kinda funny. The next time someone reads a review about a Maranello and says &quot;What the hell was I thinking when I bought my Lamborghini?&quot; will be the first time it happens. Exotic cars as a group can be expressions of ego or success. But individually their speed and heritage don't matter. They are about how they make their owners (and fans) feel, how they touch something inside in a way nothing else can. Nothing can change that.

My indoctrination came when I started reading <i>Road &amp; Track</i> when I was fourteen. This was in 1979, the dark ages for sports cars in America. In the year between the 308 Dino and the first 308GTB/GTS (the Magnum PI car), Ferrari didn't even import any cars to the US. They didn't exist and no one seemed to miss them. It wasn't uncommon in those days to see rare Ferrari's from the 50's and 60's advertised in the back of <i>R&amp;T</i>. I remember the shock of seeing someone asking the audacious price of $100,000 for a '63 250GTO. Within six years that car would command ten million.

In the absence of interesting new cars to write about, <i>R&amp;T</i> ran stories on the Golden Era of sports cars from people who had made that history. I learned about Ferrari through the writing of Rob Walker, Sterling Moss and Phil Hill. It was-and is-an amazing story, even operatic. When Mario Puzo wrote <i>The Godfather</i> more than one automotive journalist wondered if Dom Corleone was based on Enzo Ferrari. The old man was a bastard more often than not, dictatorial, cruel and egomanical. The racers who drove his cars to victory were expendable and quickly forgotten even when they died at the wheel, something that happened frequently in the golden era. (Only the death of Gilles Villenuve touched Ferrari the way you'd expect a human to react.) Yet the drivers never went away. Even when Ferrari didn't have the fastest car on the track-and that has been the case more often than not-the best drivers in the world answered the phone when Ferrari called.

I don't think the exact reason why will never be known, but there has always been a mystique around Ferrari that draws in some people and never lets them go. They are called <i>Tifosi</i> and the ones that I have known have survived quality that makes a Yugo look good, almost fatal arrogance from Maranello, no Ferrari's to sell, the gold chain years when cars somehow became investments too precious to drive and today, when the cars give us a second golden age but there is nowhere in the world to drive them as they could be the first time around.

It is Ron Tonkin, owner of a Ferrari dealer in Portland, Oregon, who asked if I needed help with anything when I made my pilgrimage to see a Ferrari in person at age 18. Instead of throwing me onto the curb he took two hours to give me a tour and talk about the cars. And Denise McCluggage, a fine racer in the 50's and a wonderful writer today, who remembers that she had a walk-up apartment with fruit crate and Salvation Army furnature in her youth &quot;-and a Ferrari. I had my priorities straight.&quot; It was the 348-owning doctor I knew who grew up in Mexico City, grinding race cams in his father's garage and dreaming about the Ferrari's that ran the <i>Carrera Pan America</i> race, and a quiet cotton farmer outside Phoenix who took out his 330 Convertible for early-evening rides with his wife when the weather was cool enough. That was his answer when someone asked him what it was worth.

I've driven a couple of Ferrari's and they're nice cars. Sometimes the sound of the engine and the feeling of the moment combined and it all made sense. I could really understand why legendary racers would endure the behaviour of <i>Il Commendore</i> to drive his cars, or why it was a reason to go to medical school instead of working in the family garage. You cannot justify a Ferrari. They are expensive to own and hideously expensive to maintain. (Aside note: Contrary to some remarks I've read elsewhere I have never met someone who could afford a Ferrari and was blasee about $10,000 maintenance bills for anything.) They are statements about your absense of charity, class and a fair deal in puberty for the envious and the insecure. And with the rise of a society that know the price of everything and the value of nothing, it is a $200,000 invitation to get rolled. But if they touch that place inside you a Ferrari is still worth the price you have to pay.

This isn't a review of the Maranello. If you've read this far I thank you for your time. I've put this up here because the 550 is a touchstone car for Ferrari. It is as accomplished as any car in the world today, but it is a car shaped by their first 50 years. This seemed an appropriate place to talk a little about what all the fuss is about.
