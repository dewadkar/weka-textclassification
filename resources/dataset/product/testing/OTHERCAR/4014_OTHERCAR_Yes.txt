            This was the first car I ever owned.  I bought it from my parents when I was 16 and drove all over the place in it.  It only had about 30,000 miles on it when I got it, but I killed it pretty quick.  It looked nice and was much roomier than it appeared.  I once fit 8 people in it.  It was very fuel efficient and I got close to 40 miles per gallon.  It had a small motor with low acceleration, but the clutch was easy to use and was a good car to learn on.  There was no power steering and it was very agile.  I wrecked it really bad (nearly totalled)and I wasn't injured in the least, it was very safe.  The automatic seat belt was a little annoying (at least to all my passengers) and I got tired of seeing the light on the dashboard everytime they'd unhook it.  The backseat didn't have enough leg room, but the front had plenty of room.  It's very light and doesn't handle well on snow.  The only problem I ever had with it mechanically was because the engine is so small.  It ran out of fuel on the highway and locked up before I had a chance to pull over.  That was it, time to get a new car.  So check the oil often.  I'd suggest this car to teenagers and college students, people that are gonna be driving around a lot in a small area.<br><br>
