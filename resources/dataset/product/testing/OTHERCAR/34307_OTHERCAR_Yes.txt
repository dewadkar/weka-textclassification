            I've been happily driving my Pearl White 1992 Allante w/black leather interior for about a year.  I've owned a number of sports cars (corvette, Camaro, Z3, BMW, etc.) over the years but the Allante is hands-down the best. 

Gorgeous good looks is a big part of what makes Allante a true American Sports Car.  It's reminiscent of the '60s muscle cars but has a style all its own.  The Pearl White paint looks pearl white during the day but changes to a sleek silver at night.  The sidelights, tail lights, and front lights are all designed and positioned to not only provide great driver visibility but make an interesting and impressive display for passersby as well.  More than a few people have said, "What kind of car is that?" when gazing at the tail-lights of an Allante after being passed.

Balancing looks, speed, and comfort is the biggest problem facing sports cars.  Cadillac has found the perfect combination in the Allante.  The unique Italian body style by PinnanFarina is timeless and makes the Allante stand out from other sports cars.  In fact, people ask me every week how I like my NEW Allante, they're shocked when I tell them its a '92 (that's proof of a timeless body design).

Handling is superb.  The Allante gives you a great feel for the road.  It's speed dependent steering actually increases stability and performance the faster you drive.  Speeds in excess of 100 mph seem like you're doing 40 mph.  Corning is incredible!  The Allante hugs the road like a cat and its acceleration around corners is nothing short of amazing.  

Comfort is incredible.  Unlike the hard pin-cushion seats of the 2002 T-Bird, Mustang, or BMW, the Allante's seats are roomy, soft, and very comfortable.  Tons of adjustments are available (including lumbar, of course) with 2 memory settings (for his and hers).  I'm over 6 feet tall, and there's plenty of leg room, and not only that, there's tons of head room as well.  I can even wear a stetson without having it rub the convertible top.  (Try that in a BMW, Corvette, or Mustang!)  The Allante is WIDE, providing great handling and a roomy interior, even for a two-seat sports car. 

Luxury is everywhere in Allante.  The digital dash display always impresses the crowd, and the full compliment (way too many to list) of accessories (CD, cassette, cruise, A/C, climate control, twilight sentinel, etc.) is what you expect from Cadillac (nothing but the best).  Every button, knob, or latch has a heavy, quality feel to it -- nothing cheap or flimsy (like in Mustangs and Sebrings).  Allante is CADILLAC QUALITY in every respect.

Price - well, Allantes aren't cheap but then the best never is.  You still get what you pay for.  You can spend less and buy something else but if you want the kind of car that real car lovers dream about, then Allante is for you.
