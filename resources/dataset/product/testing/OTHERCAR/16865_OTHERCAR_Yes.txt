            I got this camera as a present. Personally I probably wouldn't buy a digital camera myself. Reason being is that I have taken photography courses for over 3 years and even had my own darkroom in my house. My point is that with a manual 35mm camera your options are endless. You can set the aperture, the f/stop, and exposure. 
If you are not an intermediate or Junior photographer you probably have no idea what I am talking about. If that is so, then this camera is perfect for you.
Actually it is even good for more advanced photographers with all its different options.
-You can choose what resolution you would like your pictures(I believe there is 4 options). The lower the resolution the more pictures you can save on a disk. I think the max you could fit on one floppy disk is about 20(lowest resolution) give or take a couple. The least you can get on one is around 5 (highest resolution). I use the 1024 x 960 resolution(this gets 10 pictures per disc). Clear pictures but not TOO clear.
Personally if you use the higher resolutions you can see every tiny detail on your subjects. Take that into consideration when picturing people. I don't think they would like everyone to see the little blemishes or hair that they missed while shaving.
At the same time this could be a good thing depending on what you are shooting.
-You can change the format of the pictures (ie, black & white, sepia tone, polarized, and negative effect)
-You can date-timestamp the pictures if you like
-You can record up to one minute of mpeg on one floppy
The battery lasts a long time. 
When you take a picture and you know it was crap you can delete it right away instead of waiting for your roll to get back and realizing that the you had the cap on the camera for the whole roll.
You can edit, copy, delete pictures right with the camera without hooking up to a pc. PC compatibility is simple and works very well.
If you want you could get a memory stick (around $30 for a 8MB, $80 for a 32MB stick, $140 for a 64MB). I have the 32MB memory stick.
With the resolution setting I have set, I can fit about 200 pictures on my memory stick.
The camera is a bit bulky, but has a good carrying case with plenty of room for disks(carrying case sold separately).
If you have a tv with A/V input/outputs, you can hook the camera up to the tv(wires included w/camera)to show a group of friends your pictures without everyone huddling around the camera. You can use the slideshow so you dont have to manually click through each picture(very convenient when showing alot of pictures).
There are also ALOT of accessories out there for this thing. They have a printer that hooks right up to it to print out your pictures(on high glossy paper). Wide lenses and fish eye lenses, filters, and the list goes on. All these others are quite pricey though.
Overall I was pleased with my gift. If I could save up enough money, I could start buying the accessories.
