            Have never owned an import before. Have had a chevy malibu, ford tempo, buick century and buick lesabre so owning an import was big leap of faith. But what an experience it has been so far. The 2002 Camry XLE has performed beyond expectations. The lumber support on the seats are excellent. Since we have back problems, we opted for the power seats and it was worth the investment. The ride is very quiet except for some wind noise on the freeway. The engine is so quiet that you cannot tell if it is ON. The ride is very smooth and the visibility is exceptional. The blind spot can be a bit tricky at times but the outside mirrors do a very good job. The JBL stereo system spins out excellent sound when the CD is playing but when you switch over to the radio you do notice that it falls flat and is not as good. Overall: Excellent car
