            I think the chevy cavalier is a wonderful car.  It is good on gas mileage and it looks great.  I have a 1999 4 door sedan.  It is the basic one but it suits me just perfectly.  It isn't too fancy and it is good for the price.  I think it looks better than all the other compact cars and it has good pick up.  It is roomy compared to a lot of compact cars.  I have been told it is the largest of the compact cars made.  It is very stylish and I have had no problems with it what so ever.  I would definitely recommend this to many people.  Probably small families, single people, senior citizens, or even just newly married people.  I think it can suit almost anyone except large families.  The trunk is pretty big and so is the back seat.  Roomier than you would expect for a compact car.  I'd say very comfortable.<br><br>
