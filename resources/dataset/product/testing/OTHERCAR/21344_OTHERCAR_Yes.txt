            A very reliable smart buy. Even if you never admired family cars, you'll be surprised how attached you can get to a Camry. The main thing I liked about the car is that it's extremely comfortable: the ride is very smooth and quiet. Other reasons I bought the car was that it was somewhat affordable, but a great buy for what you get. Compared to its competitors (Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima), the Camry is more bang for the buck.

Dark-colored Camry's can look somewhat sporty. But if you want a sports car, do not get the Camry. I suppose the Camry Solara (the coupe Camry) in the right color and with the right options could be your sport-luxury vehicle.

You can even get Camry's two-tone colored so they look like Lexus's. I happen to have a '93 Lexus ES300, and the Camry is basically the same car (think of a Lexus ES300 as a Camry with boatloads of options). And unlike many other vehicles on the market, the Camry interior doesn't feel and look tacky. I have driven countless rental cars where the interior is basically plastic, like a kid's toy. The Camry interior is, while it may indeed be some form of plastic, more leather-like and less plastic like.

On the outside, the Camry really looks like a generic sedan. This is unfortunate, but once you take a test drive you'll realize why it's so popular. This really is a semi-luxury ride. The cabin isolates you from the outdoor environment, and if you live in Oregon like I do, this is a nice thing.

I own a white '99 Camry LE, with the Extra Value Package (Deluxe 3-in-1 CD/Radio/Cassette with Power Driver Seat and ABS). I have found no reason to spend much more money on the other options. And I would suggest buying floor mats from GI Joe's or some other superstore. Sheep skin seats are a nice addition.

BE WARNED, Camry's are theft prone. I had my radiator, both airbags, seat belts, trunk liner, headliner, and stereo all stolen... including the entire car. Only buy a Camry if you can protect it (same applies to Corollas).

As far as reliability, I only had one issue. The driver's side sun visor (you know, where the vanity mirror usually goes) hinge broke. Toyota says this usually happens a lot in newer Camrys. They'll replace it for free because of the warranty.<br><br>
