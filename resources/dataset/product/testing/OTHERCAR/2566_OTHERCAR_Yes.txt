            I remember the day like it was yesterday. I saw a beautiful car pull into the parking lot at the country club, It was a 1992 Honda Prelude, Black with matching interior. I said to my mom, &quot;One day I will own that car.&quot; She replied with a &quot;yeah right&quot;, or a &quot;keep dreaming&quot;, or something like that. A few years later I proved her wrong.

I was so sick of my Mitsubishi Eclipse after only a year and a half, I was ready to make an upgrade. Before the Eclipse I had driven an 1986 Honda Accord, and that is where I fell in love with Honda. I knew what I wanted, a Prelude, all I had to do was find the right one. 

After a short search I found it. Just like the first one I saw, Black '92, matching interior. It was like God was shining a light down on it, it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. And soon it would be mine.

I loved this car. I had to trade it in for a family wagon (see my review on the Honda CRV) about a year ago, but my heart still beats for the Prelude. I almost cry when I see one on the road. I truly belive that the 1992 bodystyle is the most beautiful car ever made. But this car is more than looks alone.

This car can perform. It drives like a race car, corners like it's on a rail, and is so much fun to drive it should be illegal. To maximize fun factor make sure you get a manual transmission, it improves the driving experience tenfold. Once you drive a Prelude there is no turning back, you are hooked for life.

Not only does this car have jaw dropping good looks, and top notch performance, it is a Honda (which translated into Japanese means reliable). I drove my 1992 Prelude until it hit 130,000 miles, and had no problems with it whatsoever until the timing belt needed replacing. After that was fixed it was great until we parted ways. Never needed a new anything, except normal wear and tear parts like brakes and tires. It ran beautifully for me from day one.

There was only one bad thing about my Prelude. As she got older, her air conditioner started to have some troubles. But that wasn't until she hit 120,000 miles, and probably would have gone unnoticed had I not been living in North Carolina at the time. That was the only drop off I noticed over the years.

I miss my dream car. One day I hope to own another one. I can not recommend this car to you more! Everything about it is perfection, and I hope you learn to love the Honda Prelude as much as I do.
