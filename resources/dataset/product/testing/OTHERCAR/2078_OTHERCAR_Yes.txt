            Most industry insiders and dealers will tell you the truth about this vehicle if you ask or bug them.  In this case, they will agree that the Jetta 1.8 Turbo is on a mission.  It has conquered the hearts of many western buyers,especially American buyers.  Most people will tell you that there does not seem to be much of a difference between the Golf and the Jetta (See my review on the Golf). More importantly, the Volksvwagen Group has decided to enhance the images of this German engineering's proud moments. For a lot of Jetta owners, it has become a luxury vehicle.  It's way up there thanks to its power, solidity, security and value.

<b>The 2001 VW Jetta TDI value you are getting for your money</b>

You don't have much to worry about.  The Jetta shares the same platform as the Golf, the New Beetle, and the Audi TT.  You know that you are treading in luxury, upscale territory with this vehicle.  If you have never owned or driven a VW, you may not understand the impact of what you are currently reading. Growing up with The Thing, I marvel at how far German engineers have taken this people's car.  They have truly boosted,upped the engineering and design departments.   There is no doubt that the Jetta TDI is beating its competitors on the market.  What are we talking about here?  Have you looked at the recent Chevrolet Cavalier, Saturn LS and others lately?  Yes, you may have to spend a bit more, but what you get is straight value for your bucks.

<b>Great acceleration and other features</b>

The Volkswagen Jetta 1.8 Turbo GLS is a five-passenger and 4-door sedan.  It has some great safety features with all the front and side-head impact air bags.  You want to know that you are going to be protected in case of a side collision.  As I was test-driving this one, I had no problems getting on the freeway (freeway 99 North).  It's easy to accelerate it.  Just like the Golf, I had great visibility.  All of this is made possible by the arrangement and the display of materials such as the dashboard, console etc.  Everything is very accessible.  Just reach and grab your chocolate or coffee cup.  The cup holders can take care of your fast-food take out drinks.  No worry there!

If you are interested in the looks, the Jetta has it too.
