            Well, all I wanted was a new, sporty, economical suv that looked good on me and my wallet, and I wanted it hunter green.  So, in May of 98 I marched over to the KIA dealer with a wad of cash and made a deal.  Since they didnt have a hunter green one on the lot, I had to wait til almost 9pm for one to come from another dealer.  Me and my dream car went home.  

Next day, I was back at the dealer because the locks kept jumping up and down.  They wanted me to be satisfied, and said they would do whatever it took to make me satisfied.  They gave me a loaner, the first of many, and I mean MANY.  It became a joke at my job, every other day, and me with a different vehicle.  So, after they fixed the locks - it took 3 seperate tries and they never did tell me what that was about - the check engine light came on.  Over and over.  They started that &quot;are you filling the gas tank with the engine running? Are you turning the cap til it clicks?&quot; etc etc etc.  Time after time they kept insisting it was fixed, yet still the light would come on.  

Then, the bucking started.  Chugging, stalling, and bucking down the road is not only dangerous but embarassing.  No quick fix for that, either. I also couldn't understand why a brand new vehicle would require 10 minutes of running before the defroster would work. One time that I had it in the shop for the check engine light, I mentioned that the seal around the windshield was buckled.  Their solution?  Replace the front passenger door.  Another 4 days in the shop.  The intermittant electrical failure was annoying, too.  Ok, so we are on like day 25 of ownership at this point,... and it smells like antifreeze inside the sportage.  Pop the hood, and there is antifreeze everywhere.  They told me this was normal.  Not in my world, it wasn't.

At this point, I drove to the dealer and asked him to make good on the promise to satisfy me, and I advised that I wanted another vehicle, preferably one not made by hungover employees on a Monday. He was not happy with my request, but he finally agreed.  I got another one, although the new one didnt have a roof rack (Them:&quot;it has pinstriping.  Pinstriping is better than a roof rack.&quot; Me: &quot;how can you tie a christmas tree to pinstriping?&quot;)  But, I decided, this would be better than nothing. I was not exactly correct.

The new one doesnt have any more reliability than the old one.  I had it in for the check enging light and asked them to check out why it was making funny noises when I tried to crank it up.  They said it was the battery.  I asked them what kind it was, and they said 3 year.  I said, wellllll, I have only had it 1.5 yrs, soooo, shouldnt it have a little more life in it?  The battery was working, that wasnt the problem, the problem was weird noises from the starter.  They didnt appreciate my observation, and replaced the battery (I paid half the cost) and also didnt appreciate me requesting a 3 year battery with 3 years still in it.  In fact, the service guy said he had no control over how old the vehicle was when I bought it (duh - it was supposed to be new)  

And even worse, I moved out of state and the service dept in Augusta Georgia is the most hateful bunch of brats I've ever encountered.  They treat me like I have personally offended them, even though Im requesting service connected with the warranty.  I have to take it back in again because all of a sudden it sounds like a jet.  I think a gasket blew, and its losing power/stalling, and just got the recall notice regarding the wiring harness, but they already replaced that, so I dont have any idea what the excuse will be this time.  The part I hate the most is that I have heard them talk about me, watched them looked at me like I have leprosy, and act like their crappy product is my doing.  

Well, at least its green.

Update: March 20, 2000

Took it back into the shop for 1) the recall notice about the wiring harness 2) check engine light on again 3) the intermittant bucking again.  Now get this,.....they already replaced the wiring harness, but when I reminded them of this, they told me &quot;it was another section of wires&quot;.  Right.  So, I have my husband to call up and ask if its ready, they said that they were trying to figure out the problem with the bucking, and that possibly we needed to replace the spark plug cables.  My husband Mike flipped!!  He told them they had already replaced those, and they *&amp;%$ sure better last more than 7000 miles!  They backpedaled, said &quot;oh, maybe we should check the history&quot;  Mike:  &quot;yeah, maybe you should&quot; So, they never did give me anything concrete on the bucking, because it is intermittant, and now Mike is trying to convince me to trade it in on something else.  Something that will run.  We'll see,....<br><br>
