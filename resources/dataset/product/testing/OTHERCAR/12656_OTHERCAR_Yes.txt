            We have owned our 1995 GMC Jimmy since 1997.  I must admit that we love our car... not only is it beautiful but we love the way it handles our needs.  It's great for the snow and for shopping.. especially when you have lots of things that you've bought.  You can easily hide your items in the back.. and the back seat converts flat(like a bed).  The only problem that we have had is with the anti-lock breaks.  Just recently, we got into an accident because of them.  We made a brief stop(the kind you made at a stop sign) and our car acted funny.. picked up speed, ran into another car, and ran into a call box.. without my control.  I don't understand what the anti-lock breaks are for if in the end.. you can't control your car.  If there were someway to control this on the car.. it would be perfect!<br><br>
