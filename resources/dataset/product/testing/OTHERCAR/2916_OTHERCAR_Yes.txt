            Overall the car is a great package for the price for someone who is looking for reliability, luxury, and a little bit of speed. It isn't for someone who is looking to make a huge scene with a green light burnout, but a car for enjoying twisting back roads at high speeds.I recently got my hands on a brand new car, the Acura RSX Type-S. Ever since I have gotten it I rarely want to leave the drivers seat. 

The exterior styling with its many options gives an elegant, but still aggressive feel. There are many factory options for the exterior styling such as the side skirts, front lip, and rear underspoiler which give the body a much more full look. Also you can opt for the gold package which makes the exhaust tip, and emblems gold. 

The interior is just as striking as the new age design of the exterior. The seats are full leather and extremely comfortable. The dashboard is extremely driver oriented. Everything is facing directly towards the driver and is extremely easy to use and to view. The gages are my favorite part of the dash. There are only four on the dash. Oil temperature, gas gage, tachometer, speedometer. The tachometer and speedometer are extremely large and extremely easy to read. At night when the headlights are turned on the entire dashboard turns a blood red color that is extremely easy on the eyes and looks extremely nice. Unfortunately the back seats do not have the most space possible but full size adults can fit inside of them. 

The car is extremely drivable. The closely geared 6 speed transmission is very fun to use. The clutch is extremely gentle and even an inexperienced driver can learn to drive the car within a matter of hours. Unfortunately in 2002 many people had issues with the shift into second gear being very notchy, I personally do not have this problem. The low end torque is unfortunately non existent so getting started from a stop is slower then most sports on the market. This is because of the I4 engine though. The upside of having this engine is the extreme gas mileage which gives 24 to 31 miles per gallon in the Type-S version, and even more in the base. 

The handling in the base RSX is already extremely impressive and the RSX Type-S was given an even stiffer more controllable suspension. Driving this car though twisty back roads is a very enjoyable experience. When pushing the car to its limits sometimes understeer, or plowing, is experienced but for the average driver that will never be a problem.

The sound system isn't anything extremely impressive but is deffinetly better then the average system. In the Type-S trim of the car it is given a Bose upgrade with a 5 speaker system and a large sub woofer in the trunk.

Overall the car is a great package for the price for someone who is looking for reliability, luxury, and a little bit of speed. It isn't for someone who is looking to make a huge scene with a green light burnout, but a car for enjoying twisting back roads at high speeds.
