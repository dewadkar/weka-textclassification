            Many question the value in buying a used automobile.  I purchased my current 93 Lincoln Town Car in 1995. At that time, it had been driven 38,000 miles but appeared to be in excellent condition.  I was able to purchase it from a Linclon dealer for about one half the original retail selling price.

Since I purchased it, my wife and I have driven it until now the odometer reads 161,000 miles.  This had been done while burning only regular gasoline and doing routine maintenance. I have purchased new tires twice, had one engine tuneup and one brake job.  Everything about it functions as good today as when I purchased it.

Never before have I enjoyed luxury transportation at such low cost and I have been associated with the retail auto business for over 50 years.<br><br>
