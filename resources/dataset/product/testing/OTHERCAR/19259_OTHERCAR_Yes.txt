            I bought my 1999 Chevy Silverado 2500 in June '99.  This truck is loaded with all options except leather.  The truck has the heavy duty suspension, 
6 litre V8 gas engine, auto overdrive transmission, four wheel drive, four wheel anti-lock disc brakes, extra cab and 8 foot bed.  I have logged over
10,000 miles on this truck, with no problems to date.  The big v8 engine has 300 horsepower, and 350 lb./ft. of torque.  This engine is a beast!
Ultra powerful and relatively fuel efficient.  Driving in town nets around 
11 mpg, as I had expected, but on a recent road trip to Va., I netted over
19 mpg!  I was amazed at this fact, so I verified on the return trip.

I do have to make a service visit to the dealership where I purchased the 
truck.  When I start the truck, the engine makes a light knocking noise for approximately 3 minutes, then sounds normal.  I may be paranoid, because the previous Dodge Ram I owned spun the crankshaft bearings at 65,000 miles, so I am being cautious.  This engine noise is the only problem I have experienced with my new Chevy, if, in fact it is a problem at all.

I am a business owner, rewiring apartment buildings for cable television and telephone wiring, so I am constantly hauling heavy (75-80lbs.) spools of cable wire, as well as hauling an 8 foot trailer loaded with ladders and other equipment.  This truck pulls the load effortlessly, as if empty.
I am constantly amazed by the strength of this truck.  It has power to spare.

I also own some remote property in the north GA mountains, and do a lot of dirt bike riding.  There have been many occasions that I have had to traverse rough, logging trail type passages, and have never become stuck.
The four wheel drive system is excellent.

With a purchase price of $30,175.00, I feel comfortable that my money has been well spent.<br><br>
