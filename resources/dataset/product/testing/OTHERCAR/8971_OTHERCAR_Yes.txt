            After the mournful death of our precious 1985 Chevrolet Cavalier (Rest in Peace), the 2000 Pontiac Grand Am SE was the next best thing to buy.  We (as in my family) bought one about 8 months ago.  The car comes fully loaded with a spacious interior, and a trunk that could fit an elephant in!

After the past two thirds of the year, we have yet to encounter a problem; which is good of course. The 2000 Grand Am SE has changed its look into a more sporty one.  If you buy the car with a spoiler, it looks even sportier.  The only bad thing about the car is the size.  Its awkwardness in size makes it uncomfortbale on turns and sometimes I wish I had the 85 Cavalier back.  Don't get me wrong you do get used to the turns.

The 2000 Pontiac Grand Am SE was analyzed and voted as the safest car in 1999 and 2000.  Out of all the cars in the safety category, the drivers side door received 4 stars out of 5, while all the rest had 2 stars or lower.

Overall, an affordable, spacious, and stylish car for this centuries North American driver.<br><br>
