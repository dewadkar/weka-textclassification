            I bought my Dodge Ram 1500 XLT last year with a 1996 Monte Carlo Z-34 trade in.  I have to tell you, I will never go back to a car again!  I loved my Monte Carlo, and I still wouldn't mind the better mileage, but you cant throw a motorcycle in the back of your car, or for that matter move your furniture into your new house!  The feeling of sitting high is unbeatable!

As far as the Dodge, I test drove several units.  The newer Fords and Chevy's are both higher priced than the Dodge, at least in my area.  The Ford truck will really kill your back after sitting in it for extended periods of time, so be sure to think about comfort during the test drive.  I would hate to hear that you had bought a truck and then found out it was uncomfortable!  The Chevy is very similar to the Dodge in comfort and roominess, but the options cost quite a bit more.  Make sure that the price in the window is the price with the options and not just the base model.  I would recommend the Dodge highly, because as far as trucks go, this one is the best looking and best for the money!<br><br>
