            RAV4 is a fantastic new-age SUV and it can satisfy its owner in almost most aspects . It can achieve high - for a SUV - cornering speeds, it can "survive" in very tough situations, varying from sandy beaches up to heavy snowy mountains and it can successfully play the role of the sole family car. In addition to the above, let us not forget the excellent Toyota after sales services. Unfortunately, it has few - but important for me - negative points. The engine noise can be very obtrusive if you travel on the motorway at speeds over 120 km/h and the driving position is one of the poorest i've ever been in to. The basic problem with the driving position is not the seat itself but the type of adjustments that can be done on both the steering wheel and the back of the seat. It is a great disadvantage - especially for drivers of over 1.90 m. tall - that the steering wheel cannot be in-depth adjusted. You end up either having your legs far enough from the pedals but your hands struggling to catch the wheel or you can conveniently catch the wheel but your legs been extremely close to the pedals. On top of that, the back of the driver's seat cannot be adjusted on a continuous pattern but instead you have pre-arranged positions that you can select by shifting the lever of the back of driver's seat. At the end of the day, the arrangements that you can do on the driver's seat are not of high standards and leaves you wondering why you cannot find the "perfect" position. I'm currently thinking of changing my RAV4 with another SUV (maybe the new Honda CRV) because although the car itself is mostly trouble-free and a very good overall buy, i cannot drive it for more than 1,5 hours and not getting tired.
