            I recently got a chance to test the grandaddy of sports-utilities--the Jeep Cherokee.  Credited by many as the first mainstream sports-ute, the Cherokee has endured more than fifteen years in practically the same boxy form.  The current Cherokee wears a new interior and slightly updated exterior that dates to the '97 model year.

<b>Trim Levels</b>
Four trim levels are available.  Base <b>SE</b> models, available with either two- or four-doors, are pretty bare-bones with standard inline-four engine and five-speed transmission.  Good as basic transportation, the <b>SE's</b> starting price is around $20,000. <b>Sport</b> models are also available as two- or four-doors and feature a standard inline six cylinder engine.  Upgraded interior and exterior appearance and more standard features also come with the Sport.  The four-door Cherokee <b>Classic</b> comes with standard four-speed automatic transmission and the four-liter six cylinder engine.  Upgraded cloth seats (with driver's side power feature) are standard, as well as monochromatic exterior appearance package and 16-inch alloy wheels.  Top-of-the-line <b>Limited</b> Cherokees come with standard leather seating surfaces, standard power accessories, and chrome accents on the exterior.  A popularly equipped Limited model will cost around $27,000.

<b>My Test Vehicle</b>
I tested a 2000 Cherokee Classic finished in Silverstone Metallic over Agate Cloth.  The Jeep came equipped with all popular options--including cruise control, power windows and door locks, air-conditioning, CD/cassette player, remote keyless entry, overhead console, roof rack, and Selec-trac four-wheel drive.

<b>Exterior Styling</b>
The exterior of the Cherokee is not going to turn any heads.  Some may call it &quot;classic&quot; while others will find it hoplessly dated.  The monochromatic paint job added style to the uninspired design, but I felt that the Jeep was still lagging years behind its competition when it came to curbside appeal.

<b>Interior Comfort, Convenience, and Styling</b>
The interior of the Cherokee left a lot to be desired.  The Classic features Cherokee's best cloth seats, but they still looked better suited to an economy car than a $25,000 vehicle.  I found the front seats to be adequately roomy and comfortable, but I imagine that larger individuals would disagree.  The backseat was miserable...with very little leg room and uncomfortably low seatbacks.  

Dash layout was pretty clear-cut, with three large knobs for the climate control, and a stereo system within easy reach of the driver.  I found the placement of the foglight switch (low-down in the center of the dash) to be awkward, but otherwise everything was sensibly located.  As with everything else about the interior, the controls and dash felt cheap--with clunky buttons and hard plastic being the rule.

<b>Power and Handling</b>
The engine-transmission combo in the Classic provided admirable passing and cruising power.  Jeep claims that this drivetrain can tow up to 5,000 pounds, but I imagine it would be slow-going with that sort of load.  I did notice a slight lag before downshifting when I pressed the accelerator all the way down.  The engine had a nice &quot;growl&quot; to it, the only noise that intruded into the quiet cabin.  

The Classic I tried was outfitted with the optional Selec-Trac four wheel drive system.  It features a full-time mode that is not offered on the standard Command-Trac four wheel drive.  The system allows two-wheel (rear) drive for normal conditions, a mode that separates torque evenly between the front and back wheels for extremely loose or slippery surfaces, the full-time mode which allows the front and rear wheels to spin independantly of one another, and a low mode perfect for getting out of deep snow drifts or other &quot;sticky&quot; situations.

<b>Expected Reliability</b>
As a Chrysler product, I would expect some quality issues and minor annoyances to pop-up in the Cherokee.  But the drivetrain used in these vehicles is old, proven, and seems to wear like iron. Properly maintained Cherokees should travel well over 100,000 miles without major mechanical breakdown.

<b>Overall</b>
With a nicer interior and more cutting-edge exterior styling, the Cherokee would compete better with its more modern competition.  It is priced beneath models like the Ford Explorer and Toyota 4-Runner, but lags behind in space and luxury.  I would recommend the Cherokee for singles, couples, and small families needing the versatility that its large cargo area and optional four-wheel drive offer.  If you normally carry more than two adults, or seek a luxurious vehicle to carry you from A to B, then look elsewhere.
