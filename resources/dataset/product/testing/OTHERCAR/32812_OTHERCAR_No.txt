            A 1995 Chevy Cavalier was my older brother's first car. We purchased it in the fall of 1994.

<b> Initial Impression </b>
When I first sat in this car, I was in the back seat. The first thing I noticed was that there was alot of head room and a decent amount of leg room. This car seemed pretty big on the inside. I scanned the intstrument panel. The layout seemed ok. Buttons were in reach, panels were visible. So, my brother started driving the car. The ride was pretty smooth... and the engine was just a bit loud.

<b> Later on... </b>
So... two years pass, there were no major problems with this car. My brother drove it everyday to school. And it was doing well. The third year he had it, the brakes had problems. It seemed that the brakes would randomly stop working. Of course this is very dangerous, and we had it fixed. But.. the problem still persisted. At this time, my parents agreed to buy him a new 1999 BMW328i. Because of this, I drove the Cavalier in the winters since my first car was a very modified Civic, which could not be driven in snow. Anyways, I got to experience what driving a Cavalier was like. And the brake problem did happen... not often but sometimes. Sometimes when I stepped on the brakes, it would depress all the way to the floor, and there was little stopping power. I had no idea what was wrong, and i took it to numerous shops, and they found nothing wrong. Also, the check engine light and ABS light would randomly be on sometimes when you start the car... and still we could not find any problems with it.

<b> Fed up... </b>
So, after the winter I drove the Cavalier, it was time for me to get a new car. I sold my Civic and bought a new 2000 BMW 328i. By that time, my little brother was now driving the Cavalier. It would overheat randomly, and the check engine light and ABS light was now always on. Finally, we got fed up with the Cavalier and just gave it away. Now my little brother is looking into buying a new Civic Si.

<b> Conclusion </b>
Well, I guess the Cavalier is a decent car... for the first two or three years. After that, alot of mechanical problems plague it. Maybe we got a bad one, or whatever. But, compared to the Civic I had (which had no problems for 3 years), the Cavalier is a pretty bad car. Thus, I certainly would not recommend buying a Cavalier.<br><br>
