            I first saw a Lamborghini LM002 about six years ago and I immediately began to try and find out more information. My quest led me to the fact that they had only made about 1000 and only from 1989-1991. I also found out that the cost was about $ 160,000, Ouch. I casually looked for one during the next six years without any luck until I took a wrong turn in Santa Monica last summer and put skid marks in the road as I saw a shiny, red one in a showroom window. I am now the proud owner of a 1990 model. It is the ultimate man's machine. It weighs 7000 pounds, sports the Countach V12 engine, has indoor and outdoor seating (for your bodyguards, or friends that can't fit inside), and giant bullet proof wheels. It is an urban assault vehicle, a sand tank, the most unique SUV, and fully Y2K proof. It takes both hands to drive this beast, but it loves the owner that lets it run. The clutch is stiff and the gearing a little tempermental until you get the hang of it. The suspension is so stiff it corners almost like a sports car. Originally made for the Saudi Arabian Military, I appreciated this fact when I raced mine around in the sand dunes of California. This is not a woman's car, but they will love riding in it with you. People guess it is some kind of Hummer, but they are blown away when they find out it is a Lamborghini. Gas Mileage is only about 7 mpg, but the 450 HP, more than makes it worth it. Stay away from the 1989 models that do not have fuel injection. I think there are only about 80 in the USA, so good luck finding one, but well worth the pursuit!<br><br>
