            This was the worst car purchse anyone can make. From the day after I drove it off the lot I have had problem after problem. It was new when I purchased it and everyone I have talked to told me the squeeling brakes are normal. I liked the price of the car and the best thing was the extended warranty that paid off. I do not recommend this to anyone to buy.



I am warning anyone out there.....DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE.
I cannot warn you enough. It may look cute on the outside and be fun to drive for a test drive but there is no space if you want children, there is no space for someone tall riding in your car, it is uncomfortable and has way too many problems.<br><br>
