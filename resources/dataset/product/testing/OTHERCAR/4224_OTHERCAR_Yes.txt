            I purchased my 1994 Cadillac DeVille with some reservations. I am wary of front-wheel drive vehicles because I believe they aren't as reliable or perform as well as rear-wheel drive cars. I have seen many front-wheel drive systems fail on friends' foreign and domestic cars. My girlfriend was replacing CV joints on her Volkswagen Fox every few thousand miles and another friend replaced the transaxle in his Chevrolet Citation at least twice. A relative managed to break the transaxle in his Ford Tempo hitting a curb. I have also heard that front-wheel drive vehicles eat front tires with a vengeance and have a nasty torque-steer trait.

I was actually interested in purchasing the big Fleetwood Brougham when I purchased the DeVille instead. My reason for putting the DeVille over the Fleetwood? The Fleetwood was too big to fit in my garage. I also own a 1989 Brougham which barely fits in the garage. The 1994 Fleetwood was four inches longer than my 1989 Brougham.

The DeVille has pleasant, sleek styling that was nicer than the Fleetwood with a more modern-looking interior. The more rounded aerodynamic styling makes my lady friend's 1992 DeVille look like the box the '94 came in. 
The Carmine Red finish is a real eye-catcher. The leather and wood trimmed interior has a rich look and the slick dashboard is a vast improvement over the old boxy look. 

My DeVille doesn't have the awesome 4.6 Northstar V-8, but its 4.9 V-8 is more than up to the task. The car can do 100mph effortlessly. The car handles much better than any previous Cadillacs I have owned. The car exhibits little or no torque steer effect. I almost forget that the car is a front-wheel drive vehicle. Traction in the winter is phenomenal. My rear-drive vehicles required studded snow tires. My '94 DeVille travels in all kinds of weather with regular all-season tires. 

The car has so-far given me over 67K miles of mostly trouble-free driving. The problems I have had were small, but annoying. Some of the trim has a chintzy look and feel to it, especially the &quot;chrome&quot; trim around the window frames. I believe it to be the same material used on my grandmother's old dinette set. There is no excuse for using such crappy material on a car as stately as a Cadillac, especially if GM wants Cadillac to play in Mercedes' or Lexus' league. The plastic lower body trim is also an embarrassment. Please, GM, lay off all the plastic on your top-of the line car. Use metal trim and good quality metal trim like that which is found on a Mercedes. My car also recently developed a bad oil leak and it was traced to the poor design of the oil pan plug. The oil pan plug employs a rubber grommet instead of a nylon washer like other vehicles I've owned. The rubber grommet deteriorates over time necessitating a new oil plug. The plug costs about $2.97. Paint quality could also be better on this end. It is excellent quality for a Chevrolet, but mediocre for a Cadillac. I feel like getting the car repainted to a quality up to my standards. 

To summarize, I'd call the 1994 DeVille a gem with some flaws. It is a beautifully styled, extremely reliable vehicle, but it needs some attention to the details to be a truly world-class car.
