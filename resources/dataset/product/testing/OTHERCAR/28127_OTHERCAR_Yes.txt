            This is a really nice little camera for the price. It is small in size and convenient to carry around. My pictures always come out great and they are easy to get from the camera to the computer. I like the feature that lets you view your pictures on the spot so that you can delete it and take another if you aren't satisfied with what you have there in front of you. Also it seems to take almost an unlimited amount of snaps without an additional disc as it has the built in card.

Absolutely everything that you need to get started including the batteries comes with this camera.  It is easy to connect to the computer and you can plug it into a wall outlet while taking pictures indoors or transfering them to the computer so as to save on the batteries. 

I take numerous indoor and outdoor pictures each month and even in dreary weather I can buff them up to look bright and crisp with the program that comes with it. Once my pictures are posted on the net or sent out in files I can see no difference from the high end models.

If you know nothing about resolutions, LED's and other techy terms then this is the camera for you. It is a no brainer to use. Just aim and click.

My only drawback is seeing the prices that other's have paid for this camera compared to what I paid, but then I bought it when it first came out and it is working as well for me a few years later as it did when I first purchased it.
