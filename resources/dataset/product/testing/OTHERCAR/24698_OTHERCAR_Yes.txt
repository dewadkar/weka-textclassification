            A self-proclaimed truck woman, I was not excited about trading for a minivan.  However, with two baby seats, my F-150 just wasn't cutting it, and my husband was getting tired of riding in the bed!  After doing a good deal of research on the Internet, I found a 1997 Chevy Venture.

 When I took this vehicle out for a test drive, I was impressed by the way it handled.  The ride was smooth, the seats are comfortable, and I could easily see all around me.  Now that gas prices are soaring, I appreciate the gas mileage I get from my Venture.  The seats can be moved in such a way that even my long-limbed relatives can ride in comfort, and I have plenty of driving space.  

 I have discovered one quirk, which may be specific to my Venture:  when it gets really cold, or when the gas gauge gets below 1/8 of a tank, it registers full.  This doesn't happen often, but to be on the safe side, I always set my trip odometer when I fill up my tank.  I would recommend this vehicle for any Mom who likes to drive and needs versatility.  Let's Go!!  <br><br>
