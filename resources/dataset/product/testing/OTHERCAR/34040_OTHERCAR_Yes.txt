            I used Epionions to review this 1986 Pontiac 6000 before purchasing it. It was fairly well rated, so I bought it and can now say I agree with most members that it is a good car. I paid $500 for it. It handles better than most 1980's era cars of this size that I've driven. It corners fairly well, accelerates acceptably (mine has the 4 cylinder), and stops on a dime. I can not comment enough how well these brakes work. Mine has the 'heavy duty' breaks, that is 10 inch discs instead of 9 inch ones. I don't know how well the 9 inch discs stop.

Other pluses are the heater warms up fast, and it has lots of trunk space.

What I don't like about the car is the factory radio + speakers are the worst I've ever heard, the sun roof leaks after a lot of rain, and the alternator belt needs tightening every few months. This motor uses a very long alternator belt and it tends to stretch a little. It also seems a little stressed out at 75mph. I think almost all cars of this era seem to do this, when they were built the speed limit was 55 and they are made to cruise at that speed. The motor also leaks a little oil around the valve cover gasket, all the GM 2.5L's do this, don't worry about it.
