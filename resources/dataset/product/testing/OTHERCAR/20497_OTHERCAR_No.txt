            I bought my Lumina in 1998 for driving to college and back, about a three hour trip.  When I bought it, it was a very clean low mileage vehicle with only 36,xxx miles on it.  I purchased it during the summer when the weather is relatively nice.  Being from Minnesota this vehicle was going to have to go through some cooler weather in the winter and that is something this vehicle could not do.  The first winter I had it the car would sputter and all around sound awful at stop lights.  I brought it in to a few different mechanics, including two Chevrolet dealerships, and they could not find anything wrong.  Since the car ran fine on the highway and never stalled on me I kept driving it.  By the next winter it was starting to stall at some stop lights so I brought it back in and again they could find nothing wrong with it but changed the spark plugs, (which is a very labor intensive process in this car) and the fuel filter.  This helped for all of 3 weeks and the car was back to being a problem the rest of the winter.  

Since the car was low mileage and was a nice, comfortable, roomy car I kept it for another two years and then it started to die out on the highway.  I had it towed into two different shops and they did everything from change oxygen sensors to replacing computer chips and nothing worked.  Finally in December 2001 I brought it to my hometown Chev dealership and had them look at it while I started hunting for a new vehicle.  After 2 days of digging through the engine they could find nothing wrong, except that when they would road test it, it would stall on them.  Total work done to the car was 3 fuel injectors, 2 oxygen sensors, 6 spark plugs (before they should need to be replaced), 1 computer chip ($300 just for that part), along with routine maintenance result:  car still stalled in the cold weather.  

The power that this car had was adequate for the size car it was.  I had the 3.1V6 and thought that when it was running it performed fine and got pretty good gas mileage, 27hwy and 19-20 in town.  The brakes always squeaked on this car, but I just had to replace the pads once in the time I owned it, up until 80,000 miles.  

For a college car this car could have been great with how roomy it was and the gas mileage it got.  It had enough space for two adults to sit very comfortably in front and two adults in relative comfort in back.  I had the two door and it was still easy to get in and out of the back seat.  

Just a side note, the car I purchased to replace the 1991 Lumina was a 1998 Lumina LTZ with the 3.8V6 engine, I loved everything about the 1991 Lumina except the engine so that is why I went the way I did on my next car.  So far everything has been great with the 3.8.
