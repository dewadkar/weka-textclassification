            Currently, I own a 1997 626 ES, auto. I love the car in every way, except for the transmission. It has a very sporty shift action, so much so that it feels like it is going to dislodge from the chassis of the car. This shift action does not occur every time, so it was easy to dismiss it for cold start, road irregularity, etc. I've since learned that this problem is endemic to 626's between the model years of 93-Current. What's worse, there are hundreds of examples on the web of people who have experienced premature transmision failure 25-35K into ownership. Mazda claims that there is nothing irregular. If this incidence of failure is &quot;normal&quot;, I have news for Mazda. I am looking into trading my car for a 5 spd, the model I should have bought given the chance. The car is beautiful, responsive and fun to drive -- minus the jerky tranny. I feel as if I am driving a time bomb -- with the average repair cost being $2500 for a new auto. Not fun. <br><br>
