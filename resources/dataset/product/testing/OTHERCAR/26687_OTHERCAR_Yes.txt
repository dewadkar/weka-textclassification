                  Lately, I've been in the market for a digital camera.  I wanted something that could serve as a scanner and also go with me on my trip to August to Europe.  Being a student however, puts a stranglehold on the purse string.  I needed something reliable, easy to use, and affordable.  Well, I have a found a promising candidate in the OlympusD360L.

<b> My research has revealed that.... </b>

     For about $300 dollars this is a very affordable way to enter the digital camera universe.  Olympus has made a name for itself in camera.  For years it has been successful in producing affordable point and shoot cameras for the beginner.  And with this D series line it's evident that Olympus is continuing this tradition with it's digital cameras.

     If your goal is to find a camera that will allow you to take high-quality pictures on the go and work with the pictures online than consider the D360L.  Now the lack of an optical zoom or the 1.3 million pixel display will limit you if you are a serious photographer and plan on using this as your primary camera to produce portraits, but if this camera will be your first digital camera or used for all-purposes than this is a wonderful choice.

     Using the 8 mb card you should be able to take around 100 photos using the lowest setting or about 12 using the super high quality setting.  I think you'll find that this space gets used up pretty quickly and a larger storage card would be a wise investment.  Also, multiple cards will reduce the amount of times you have to unload the photos into your computer.  One thing that you'll definitely want to add to your camera purchase is a card reader.  Using the serial cable that comes with this camera is extremely slow.  The optional card reader eliminates this hassle and makes downloading pictures manageable.  

      The D360L is the next in a series of a very successful digital line from Olympus.  What they've done is improve the ISO settings and the flash modes to increase sharpness and the fight against unnecessary light and red eye.  All this at a marginal cost increase proves their commitment to this affordable camera.

      If your considering purchasing a digital camera then don't overlook the Olympus D360L.  At only $299, it's a wonderful way to experience new technology at an affordable price.<br><br>
