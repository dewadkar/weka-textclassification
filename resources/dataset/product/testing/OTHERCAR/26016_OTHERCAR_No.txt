            My Dad bought me this car when I started Highschool. It had 50K miles on it in 1996 and was 5000$, to date it has 61K.  I have a starter(fly wheel) problem, alternator problems, dash light problems(fuses are all ok) radio problems, A/C Heater switch broke, plus the A/C fan.  The locks on the trunk and driver side door don't work good.  The seat belt buckle has fallen apart.  The cup holder broke.  Its going to take 500$ to replace the flywheel because the car is front wheel drive, and the transmission is in the way, so they will have to rip that out. The good.  Great gas mileage and roomy trunk.  Does 0-60 in 15.7 seconds.  Squeaks a bunch.  A person desperate for a car should buy a cavalier otherwise look into something more durable.  <br><br>
