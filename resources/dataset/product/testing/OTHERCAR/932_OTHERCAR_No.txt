            The truth of the matter with the Avenger and other sports cars is that the Avenger may look like one it isn't.  It is very slow to 60mps.  The shifting isn't all that great.  The back end is way to high off the ground and the front is way to low(scraps bottom on even the smallest bumps).  If you are a tall person you may have trouble with your head and if you are a short person you wont be able to see out the back window.
  The only real good thing about this car is its outward look.  Everything from the front air damn to the rear spoiler is very good.  All of the inside buttons and what so ever are very easy to get to and use.  Although there is only one cup holder.  I should mention that there is really no back seat room either for teenagers and adults.
   So as far as looks go this car has class, but when you take a look at what it can do you may be disappointed.  I know because I used to sell them.<br><br>
