            ...make me think twice about owning a little car. I'll admit it, the though of owning a compact car almost scared me. Being brought up with large powerful sedans, camaros and 1/2 ton trucks, compact cars we're new to me. But after test driving the Corolla, I thought to myself "How can I not want this car?". 

The car still feels as solid today as it did the day we bought it. Which means it feels like it was carved out of a solid piece of steel. And it's reliability is unbelievable. It has NEVER been in a garage for anything other than scheduled maintenance. And we are not exactly the easiest people on cars. The car has been in two minor accidents and the maintenance schedule has been forgotten at times. To the point where the spark plugs we're replaced 30 000 miles later then was specified in the owner's manual.

Fuel economy is another thing that is unbelievable. Getting 30 MPG is very easy in this car, sometimes the gas mileage even approaches 40 MPG. This is a very cheap car to run and maintain.

The interior is very well thought out. The layout is very logical and the components are of high quality. The seats are comfortable, although on long trips, the lack of lumbar support begins to be noticed. There is plenty of room in the front, and being 6'2" this is important. The rear seats are best left to children and small adults though, since knee and head room is at a premium.

The exterior, like most japanese cars, is simple yet tasteful. The only part of the exterior that took some time to get used to was the design of the rear. Trunk space is quite good for a compact car, we can actually put about 80% of the stuff we can put in the trunk of our Dodge Intrepid.

The only thing that dissapoints me about the car is the engine. There is nothing wrong with the engine itself, it is actually a very good engine. But it is just too small for this car. Producing only 105 HP and 100 LB-FT of Torque, this engine takes time to take-off. Once the motor is past about 4500 RPM it starts to accelerate adequately though. And although the automatic transmission is strong and eager to downshift, it's the wrong transmission for this engine. The only transmission I would recommend for this small of an engine (in any car, not only the Corolla) would be a 5 spd. manual transmission.

The suspension helps this car feel a little sporty though. It's well balanced and body roll is minimal. It is also surprisingly stable at speeds in excess of 100 MPH. And the brakes are excellent. Very powerful and easy to modulate.

All in all, it will be very difficult to trade this car in next year for a newer model. But this car has made me a huge fan of Corolla's and also all Toyota's.
