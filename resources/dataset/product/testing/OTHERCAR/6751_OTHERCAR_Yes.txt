            I hate to admit it, but, I�ve always loved the thought of writing a ravaging review of what I consider to be a horrible product. Typically, the South Korean car maker's products would offer a very tempting target.  But, that would be too easy, especially, since they are all in some stage of bankruptcy.  Nonetheless, Hyundai's new Santa Fe SUV comes as a surprise.  Given that Hyundai has only been on the American market since 1986, a product like this is a revelation.  The styling is fresh and adventurous, it comes with a great warranty and it�s not half as bad as you�d think.

Hyundai first splashed down in the US Market in 1986 with the tincan Excel sub-compact, which competed with the notorious rustbucket Yugo, which was still available at that time.  The Excel was better than the Yugo, but not by much..  Nevertheless, Excel sales exploded.  Buyers were lulled into thinking that they could get a shiny brand new car for the price of a dented-up used one. Up till the first year after purchase, that was generally true. Then, all hell would break loose.  The Excel acquired a well-deserved reputation for early rust and mechanical failure.  By the early 90�s, Hyundai Motors was teetering on the edge of the proverbial precipice and their share of the car market was almost nil.  Then came the breakthrough Tiburon Coupe, the replacement for the laughable Scoupe, finally a decent looking, quality-built Hyundai with a sporty flare.  After that, Hyundai added its aggressive 10 year warranty program and sales began zooming upward once again.

The Santa Fe, designed in the U.S., is Hyundai�s first foray into the SUV.  It may be a little late, however.  The Santa Fee is based upon the compact Sonata sedan�s chassis, and, for a first effort, it shines.  It looks much better in real life than in photos.  The bodywork has lots of subtle contours hinting at the sophistication of the manufacturing process.  All the trim pieces fit solidly and the look is truly unique. It seems &quot;brawny&quot;, like an SUV should, yet it is just the right size, not too big, not too small.  Goldilocks would approve.

The interior is also well conceived, with good quality plastics throughout.  Ergonomics are generally excellent and there are some surprising features as well: like the electro-chromatic mirror that automically changes based upon lighting conditions.  The seat shapes can accommodate most body types and the seats themselves appear to be rugged as well as comfortable.  The interior is car-like rather than SUV-like.  It's comfortable.  There is a lot of hard plastic, but, it is thoughtfully integrated into the overall design.  Depending upon which model (GLS or LX) the interior can also be swathed in leather as well.  I'm not sure where the cows come from, though.  

As for practicality, the Santa Fe is much bigger inside that the outside dimensions would suggest, bigger in fact than the Honda CRV and the Toyota RAV 4.  But, then, there�s that interior smell. I guarantee you that you�ll never find a can of �New Hyundai Smell� for sale at your local Kragen Auto Parts.

The Santa Fe�s base engine is an anemic and wheezy 149 hp 4-cylinder equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission.  All but the most cost-conscious should move up to the optional, but grumpy sounding, 181 hp 2.7 liter V-6 with an automatic that can be used like a manual. This engine/transmission combo provides adequate acceleration and passing power, but, is certainly nothing to write home about unless you're s Seven Dwarfs fan.

Since it is based upon car mechanicals, the Santa Fe is clearly not intended for hard off-road use.  Unlike truck-based SUVs, like the Ford Explorer, the Santa Fe really shines on surface streets.  The ride is supple and relaxed, with minimal road noise.  Even expansion joints on the freeway are handled with a finesse unknown to most SUV drivers.  In fact, it makes you wonder if you really are in a Hyundai in the first place.  This is another breakthrough vehicle for Hyundai.

Value-wise, this new SUV from Hyundai ranks about mid-stream.  It gets high marks from me for creative styling, decent ride and abundant interior space and but only average marks for the mediocre V-6 engine and tranmission.  I'm not even going to talk about the standard 4 cyl.  

As with all Hyundai vehicles, reliability remains a persistent nagging issue, although the warranty goes great lengths to allay many concerns.  However, I prefer to stay away for the repair shop altogher and until it becomes clear that Hyundais have, in fact, become reliable vehicles, I will not recommend one to my friends.  

For a first SUV, Hyundai should be proud of the Santa Fe.  But, with room for improvement, they should set their sights on a new model, the Hyudai Sedona.  Ohmmmmmmmmm.
