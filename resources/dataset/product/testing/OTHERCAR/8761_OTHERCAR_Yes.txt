            Living in a small city on a small island with a top-notch public transporation system, we usually get by without a car.  Occasionally, though - one weekend a month at most - we rent one for 2 or 3 days.  This costs much less than actually owning one <i>all</i> the time would, but lets us lug home heavy or bulky things and go places we can't get otherwise, while keeping my driving skills from getting too rusty.  As an added plus, we get to put some serious miles on different makes and models of cars.

Our most recent plaything was a new Toyota Echo in "Electric Green Mica" - that's Toyota's name for a sort of metallic hunter green.  I reserved it over the web through cheaptickets.com and picked it up only a couple hours later at the local Alamo location.

Right away, I encountered a problem - I couldn't figure out how to release the parking brake!  It turned out that the release button just requires more force than on most other cars I've dealt with; a helpful Alamo employee released it and sent me on my way.

Over the course of a couple days, the Echo handled city traffic, expressways, a few trips over the local mountains and some long stretches of winding two-lane along the ocean, taking it all in stride.  My wife and daughter enjoyed riding in the car (well, our daughter had a stomach virus the day we got it, but the seat <i>wiped clean</i> easily enough), and the trunk was big enough to hold three big three-cubic-foot bags of compost and 2 bags of chicken manure for the garden, which my wife was <i>very</i> happy about.  (If any Alamo employees read this, now they'll know why the trunk smelled funny when they got the car back!)

Interior space was also pretty good.  I'm just about six feet tall, and I didn't feel cramped or squished.  There wasn't much room, if any, between my gas-pedal leg and the central control pod, but there doesn't need to be.  There was plenty of room in the back for our daughter in a child seat, and with the front passenger seat scooted forward, my wife was able to sit next to her without being cramped.  The seats were pretty good as well, for a compact car.

The Echo handled pretty well, though bumpy pavement felt every bit as bumpy as I'd expect it to in an economy car.  The center-dashboard placement of the instrument cluster seemed a little odd, but I didn't really look at the instruments very often.  Everything else was pretty straightforward and easy to operate, although I didn't get to the point where I could use the center-pod radio and climate controls without looking.  But hey, I only had two days!  I had a horrible time figuring out how to turn on the high beams, but eventually figured out that it involved pushing the headlight stalk <i>away</i> from me (pulling it toward me was only good for flashing them).

The only real difficulties I had with the Echo involved visibility.  The "A" pillars at the sides of the windshield seemed to be right in the way when I wanted to look where I was going during a turn, and in the rain, water pushed over to them by the wipers would blur the view through a couple inches of windshield next to the pillars as well.  An adult passenger in the back seat will pretty well block the rear view, as well - this is a good "adults in the front, kids in the back" car.

For me, the real highlight of the Echo was its gas mileage.  Two days worth of commuting, plus two trips over the mountains and up to the far end of the island (almost 100 miles each day) used less than half a tank of gas, even with some serious hills and city traffic involved.  Just driving around town, this is the sort of car that only has to stop for gas a couple times a month.  I'm eager to take a drive in Toyota's hybrid, the Prius, which <i>looks</i> an awful lot like an Echo but uses an electric motor along with its gasoline one, to get even better mileage.

Overall, the Echo was inexpensive to have and operate, performed well, and made us comfortable - pretty much <i>exactly</i> what we look for in a rental car.  Now I know why I see so many of these on the road!
