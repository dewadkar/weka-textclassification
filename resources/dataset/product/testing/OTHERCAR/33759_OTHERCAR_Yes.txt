            I've been a very happy owner of a 156 2.5 V6 for two years now. It's simply stunning! Let's start from the aspect many foreign people look for in Italian cars: style. It is undoubted that Walter de' Silva, the designer of the 156, 166 and 147, has done a great job (damn, now Seat got him!). The 156 is a very elegant car, but it doesn't lack the sporty feeling which is typical of Alfas. It (she!) almost resembles a coupe, with the back door handles which can hardly be seen. And, damn, the sporty feeling is not just a feeling! Once you start the 2.5 V6 engine you enter another world... It can quietly buzz at lower regimes, but when it's up on RPMs... You immediately recognize the typical Italian sport car sound, thanks to a fabulous exhaust system. Acceleration is very good (0-60 Mph in 7'3&quot;), and the engine is very brilliant and elastic thanks to its excellent torque curve. Just one thing... I know most of you are from USA, and so you can't go without automatic transmission, but, if you can, buy this car with the 6-gears manual transmission... You won't regret it! My 156 has Pack Sport 3, which gives her (!) a nice sporty look, and greatly enhances roadhold and stability (excellent roadhold for a front-drive car). Some of my friends have 156s too, with different engines. I've tried some of them, and I can tell you that the 2.4 JTD diesel and the 2.0 Twin Spark engine are very brilliant and powerful, despite their small size. Especially the Twin Spark series engines are a demonstration of how much a small engine can be exploited for power and torque. Still one word on the interiors: forget the cold, rational German interiors. You won't see a lot of displays and buttons on this car. Just the trip computer. And an automatic clima system, which is one of the best I've ever tried. Seats are of sport type (with Pack Sport), in a very nice and strong sporty black leather. So is the turning wheel, in black leather, offering a great grip. The gearshift is a champion in manouverability and speed. Taller people may have some problems reading the instrumentation, somewhat covered, but... is it really a problem?<br><br>
