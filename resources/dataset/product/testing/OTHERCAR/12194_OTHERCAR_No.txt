            Today I went for a drive in what I expected to be a real beast of a car, the WS6 TransAM convertible.
It sure looked like a fast US car as it sat there in its orange paint under the so.cal sun.
I got the keys from the sales person and fired it up, yep... it has a great sound.
We took it out on some back roads so I could let it stretch its legs, I started out slowly because I was told it was a real "neck-snapper" and there was other traffic on the road. Finally I got to a red light so I could make a launch when the light turned green.
I was a bit careful in 1.st gear, easy on the gas and took it to about 4000rpm, threw in 2.nd and nailed the pedal..... sure it was fast - no doubt about that, but absolutely not a "neck-snapper" as the dealer called it, no sound of wheel spin, no loud roar....nothing exiting. We took it back to the lot, and before the sales person started his sales talk I told him that I was disappointed with its performance so he should save his bullets on someone else.

Although the car was definitely a nice drive, the handling was ok, not too soft and not too hard, the low angle on the windshield prevented too much buffeting from the wind with the top down.

The interior was a bit cramped, the hand brake was located odd and the design of the dashboard was somewhat dull but OK. But WTF happened to the stereo ???...... the super-duper 6 CD stereo looked more like something from a cheap japanese car from the 80's it was definitely not the same style as the rest of the interior. I did not comment that to the dealer since I was loosing interest every minute at that point.

Bottom line if you are looking for something that looks special and is nice to drive and has above average performance, this car is the one for you, but if you expect it to make you pee your pants when you unleash it - go buy something else.

Here is a free hint to GM: Look at the interior on modern german cars and learn.
