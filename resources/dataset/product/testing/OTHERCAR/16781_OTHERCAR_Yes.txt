            I got my car, a  1990 Maroon colored Dodge Spirit in the summer of 1998, it had been my fathers car before then but he had decided to get a new car, so I got it to go to school with.  Now I live in buffalo, 280 miles from my school and I make the journey at the very least 2 times a month.  

Yes, it is an old car, but mar, is it fun to drive!  With only minor repairs needed in the over 2 years I have driven it so far, those mostly being matanace issues such as new wheels. 

When I received the car, yes, it only had 76,000 miles on it, but it has since reached over 92,000 and is still working fine.

Only real problem is that the paint on the roof and hood has started to peal off a little.<br><br>
