            I purchased my 1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue GL brand new in June of 1999. For the price of 21,997. Since then i have put 21,046 miles on her. The power of the Intrigue's new 3.5 liter Northstar V-6 blew my mind. I am the owner of a 1967 Oldsmobile 442 with a 455 cubic inch v-8 (7.6 liter) with over 500 horsepower so it's very hard to impress the likes of me. But the Intrigue did it quite well. The first time I tested its acceleration was at about 10,000 miles to assure that the engine had plenty of time to be broken in. I was sitting at a red light that is notorious for the &quot;race to the one lane change over&quot; to ensure that you wont be cut off. Sitting next to me was a 1997 Chevrolet SS Camaro with what appeared to be tuned exhaust. as I was just about to submit to him and let him in front of me I revved my 3.5 Liter Northstar Six and switched the traction control button off. The man in the camaro's jaw dropped and looked at me in shock as he examined my car.  The only modifications I made to my car was an altered air intake system and a performance chip from Summit Racing of Ohio. That ran me a total of $300.00. Well The man in the camaro was overtaken by my 21k dollar sedan that said OLDSMOBILE on the windshield. He flagged me down afterwards and asked me what I had in the car. He didnt believe me when i told him a SIX CYLINDER !!! he made me pop my hood!! Outward of the power she has she also gets EXCELLENT economy I get 24 miles per gallon in the city and 29 on the highway. The interior is a tall mans dream. And the Bose Premium sound is enough to make a deaf man hear the music. Get the spoiler I didnt like it at first but then it grew on me after i got mine with out one. Braking is more than adequate. All things considered if the 442 hadnt have already made me an OLDSMOBILE person for life the Intrigue would have won my heart as well.
The Alero was as great car too but I was too tall for its interior.
