            Last August, I purchase a 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS (4 cylinder with the sunroof).  So I've been driving it around for the past six months and have a good feel about the good and the bad of this car.  

First, the good.  The acceleration with the 5-speed manual transmission on the GS is pretty good even on the GS model.  I have heard so many people saying &quot;nice car&quot; as I drive by.  A feeling I'm not used to after driving a Chevy Cavalier for about five years.  The car doesn't come with ABS which is good because ABS is a total waste of money and insurance company data shows that there is no difference whatsoever with accident rates of cars with or without ABS.  Handling on the GS with the 16 inch rims is excellent.  I can only imagine what the GT must be like with it's 17 inch rims.

The bad...  I have to slam my doors shut for them to close all the way.  I'm not sure of this is true of all of the 2000 Eclipses.  But this is true of both my driver and passenger side doors.  In addition, when I do get the doors shut, the windows leak air inside until you roll down and then roll the windows back up to seal the weather stripping.  I have had the sunroof switch pop off of the ceiling.  The plastic molding above my gauges was not even attached to the dashboard.  I had to bring this back to the dealership to be repaired.  The cool looking gas cap that you see on the commercials is not a standard feature of the car.  The car comes with an ugly looking plastic gas cap but you can buy the aluminum one at a Mitsubishi dealer for about $120.  I have the aluminum cap, and after a few months of New England winter, the thing got all rusted.  This might be something I can get out by polishing it or something like that, but regardless, it looks ugly now.  With the windows down all the way and driving about 75-80mph, the noise is really annoying.

The car is really fun to drive and looks really good.  But it has a bunch of little things wrong with it that makes it somewhat of a hassle.  But overall, the car is good but Mitsubishi should do some work on fixing these little glitches that can be rather annoying.<br><br>
