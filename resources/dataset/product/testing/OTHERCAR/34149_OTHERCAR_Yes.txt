            Although I have not yet purchased the LX470, I have completed my
research and it's down to a few last details (price, color verification,
etc.).

Basically, I really liked the 2000 LX470, but I hated the exterior
colors.  Today I got a call from the dealership informing me that 
they just received the information on the 2001 and that it is going
to be available in Blue (the color I want).  I haven't seen the actual
Blue yet, and I admit that there are a number of good blues and a number
of not so good blues.  I'm hoping that it's the same Blue as was
available on the 1999 SC200.  A little bit brighter than Cobalt,
but a very clean pure blue in a metallic paint.  This is the most
beautiful exterior color I've seen on a car.

Everything else about the LX470 is top notch.  The ride is perfection,
the handling is excellent, and the acceleration is phenomenal for a
vehicle of it's size.  The LX470 provides excellent positive feedback
and road awareness, although somehow, it does insulate you from the
acceleration sensations, both in cornering, and in forward accelerations.

I'm told that the 2001 is going to be substantially the same as the 2000,
but the sound system has been upgraded to Mark Levinson, a navigation
system is now available, and the colors are changing.

Lexus reputation for quality and reliability can't be beat, and this
is no exception.  The car is perfectly put together and I couldn't find
a single flaw in any of the models I examined at the various dealerships
I've travelled to.  Everyone I've talked to who has one is very happy
with it and I have yet to meet a Lexus owner who has had any significant
problems with their Lexus (yes, I know several Lexus owners).

It's pricey, but if I can negotiate out the door just under MSRP, I
think it's good value for the money.
