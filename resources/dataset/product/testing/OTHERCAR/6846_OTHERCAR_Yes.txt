            Desperate times call for desperate measures, and boy, were we desperate.  So we bought this van.

[Background for those interested]  Last year at about this time, we were hit with a whole bunch of whammies.  One whammy was our 1991 Plymouth Sundance, worked but cost too much to keep working.  Whammy #2 was our sudden need to move away from the New Landlords from Hell who bought the place where we'd lived for years.  Whammy #3 - Hubby had just started a new job for less money than he'd been making at the place from which he'd been laid off.  His new job was in a not-so-good neighborhood, at least not-so-good for his wanting to see our Saturn still outside the building when he finished working late.  

Fate stepped in, in the form of a woman from Accounting.  My employer had a van at one of the Long Island sites that was up for sale, but the woman in Accounting had no idea what to tell people about it when they asked besides "It's a 1991 Caravan," "It's blue," and "It's got 109,000 miles on it."  Being the nice person I am, I said I would stop by the site and check it out.  

It was snowing that day (which turned out to be a not-so-good thing as we didn't notice the peeling paint until we'd already decided to buy it).  We looked at the van.  We looked in the van.  We checked out the size of the van, the tires, the features we could see.  Hubby said, "You know, if we get this we can ditch the Plymouth <i>and</i> avoid renting a U-Haul when we move."  Three weeks later, the van was ours.  So you must think we're nuts - we bought a 10-year old van with over 100,000 miles on it and paint peeling off.  Well, yeah.  And we're really happy.  

<b>The Good Stuff</b>

The <b>1992 Dodge Caravan</b> we bought is the Sports Edition.  Don't ask me what's sporty about it, 'cause I don't know.  It's got automatic transmission, power windows, power steering and brakes, and gets us from Point A to Point B.  

It's a seven-passenger van with removable seats that come out fairly easily through the manual sliding side door.  When the seats were out, we moved all our big stuff from our 5-room, 1-garage apartment in about four trips, including the refrigerator.  (I have a lot of big furniture.)

Surprisingly, it handles much more like a car than a van.  I was traumatized early in my driving career by trying to drive my dad's van (which, it turns out, had much more to do with my dad than his van).  I've gotten over it over time and, when Hubby and I moved a household across the state, I was the one driving the 24' U-Haul with our 1987 Chevy Nova attached to the back - Hubby was terrified.  It's a true testament to how this van handles that it has become Hubby's preferred vehicle.  Right off the bat he was able to parallel park, do three-point turns, and back into narrow driveways.  

<b>The Bad Stuff</b>

Well, it's missing a few features we would have liked, like a cassette player.  A few fuses or wires have gotten loose over the years, which means sometimes the radio works, sometimes it doesn't.  From what I can tell from the maintenance records, the employees at the Long Island site had a problem with it suddenly losing power on long highway trips, but Hubby and I haven't had that problem.  We also haven't driven to Michigan, like the previous owners did.

Originally, we had to buy a battery and do some minor repairs caused by the van sitting for about six months without anyone starting it up.  Since then, we've spent about $400 in maintenance - windshield wipers, oil changes, brakes, tune-up, radiator flush and new hoses.  Not too bad for a year in the life of a 10-year-old car. 

<b>The Ugly Stuff</b>

Oh. My. God.  This van is so ugly.  It's so ugly we don't have to worry about anyone trying to steal it from Hubby's job site.  (Hey, wait, that's a good thing...)

Apparently there was a year Plymouth got some sub-standard paint.  I vaguely remember some class-action lawsuit or recall about this.  Evidently, my employer took the money instead of getting the car repainted.  It's got paint coming up in huge chunks, like the papery bark on an oak tree.  The paint is peeling from the hood and the roof in six-inch long strips.  The light blue primer underneath is starting to erode and we're beginning to get some rusty spots.  Around our house, when I'm asking Hubby what car he's using that day or what car will be available that night, I beg him not to leave me "the Leper Van" unless I have to transport a lot of stuff or people.  

And I think, even if we get it repainted, it will still be ugly.  It's kinda boxy, kinda in the way that makes SUV's and trucks kinda ugly.  But, since we're a cheap, "Point A to Point B" family, it's kinda grown on us and we'll keep it until we've driven it into the ground.  


<b>Extra-Special Advice about Purchasing Used Vehicles!</b>

Just about everyone knows that buying used can be risky because you don't know what the previous owner(s) fixed or broke on the car.  We didn't worry about that at all with this purchase, since we bought it from my employer.  My employer sells all cars after 10 years, regardless of condition.  My employer is also meticulous about maintaining their cars - if the oil is supposed to be changed every 3,000 miles, the oil got changed every 3,000 miles, for example.  My employer allowed me to take the car to my mechanic, who told me it was a steal at over twice what they were asking.  And, since the paint was coming off and no one else wanted to go out to Long Island to see it, I was able to get it for $750, $250 less than what they were asking.  One new battery and an inspection, and I was set to jet.  In addition, I got the entire maintenance record and receipts for repairs from the Accounting Department. 

So when you're thinking of getting a car - does your company own cars?  What do they do with them when they're getting older?  How carefully do they maintain the cars?  What about cars at the end of a lease?  Ask around - maybe your friends' employers own cars that they eventually need to sell.  Hey, it's worth a shot.

<i>This review is the ninteenth installment of "Around My House in 28 Days," my response to the challenge leveled by amykhar. The challenge is to post one review every day for the whole month of February. Well, at least it's a short month. I'm starting at my door and going counter-clockwise around the house, reviewing whatever's in sight (and on this site). So far it's been the bathroom, then the kitchen, then the living room, and now the bedroom... </i>
