            I bought a 1990 Corrado G60 for $12,000.  This car was an absolute dream to drive.  The G60 supercharger adds a boost of the line, and with the way this puppy handles, you don't need to slow down for the corners.  I often recall making turns so sharp only 3 wheels were on the ground.  This freaked out my friends driving behind me, but I knew it was okay.  The handling on this car is comparable to a Porsche.  I also love the options, ABS brakes, sunroof, leather...etc.  I switched out the rims, and put some &quot;death wires&quot; on it after I bent my BBS rims.  I always kept my car waxed, so this baby turned lots of heads.  Unfortunately it also attracted the females that wanted to F*CK my car.  The gearbox is unique in the fact that it doesn't use a mechanical linkage, but rather shifter cables, so the result is always smooth shifting.  The Corrado also has a built in feature to cut the power to the engine should your RPM's reach the red line area.  And what looks cooler than getting out of you car locking your door...hold the key clockwise and the windows roll up from the outside.  I could go one and on about how much I love driving this car and it's odd features, but I think you need to know something.

   While the Corrado is a dream to drive, it's a nightmare to own.  First let me remind you that only a certain number of Corrado's were exported to the U.S. every year, so this alone will tell you it's hard to find parts for this vehicle.  And trust me this car WILL BREAK DOWN A LOT.  I had constant troubles with the electrical system in my car.  I had a battery explode, electrical windows go out ($500 a window to fix), electrical seatbelts broke (both sides), the sunroof stopped retracting, the electrical fan on the radiator went out, the electric fuel pump inside the gas tank went out, super charger hose got a hole ($60), the metal lined oil hose to the super charger cracked, CV joints, replaced the radiator, ...etc.  Basically I spent at least $20,000 in maintenance during the 5 years I owned this vehicle. The parts are hard to find (even in a big city like Dallas) I often had to special order them, and you have to have all kinds of funny VW tools to work on the car.  Plus have you ever noticed how backwards German engineering is? 

I LOVE THIS CAR, BUT BE WARNED IT WILL COST YOU MANY $$$$$ TO MAINTAIN THIS VEHICLE.
