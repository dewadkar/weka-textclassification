            Back in the early eighties I took a job working out on the oilrigs in west Texas.  The work was hard and the days were long but the pay was good.  On an average week, I could bring in anywhere from $400 to $500 dollars a paycheck not including overtime.  If I worked the holidays making time and a half I could almost double my salary for the week.  This life was goodï¿½ while it lasted.

By 1985 the oil boom had petered out and a lot of domestic oil businesses had gone bankrupt over night as a result of increased OPEC production quotas.  The company that I worked for owned ten rigs scattered across the rocky west Texas plains over a patch of land that spanned twenty square miles in each direction.  
In an effort to keep their head above water, the family who owned the rigs sold off four of their higher cost deep wells to Mobile in 1987 and continued to maintain the six shallow pumps over in the northern fields that were still producing a fair amount of crude.

Selling the rights to those four rigs paid down the interest on most of the company's notes but not all of them.  Taking the advice of an accounting firm over in Dallas the owners liquidated four of their five metal work sheds and two out of three pipe yards.  They laid off sixty percent of the workforce in 1988 and closed down one of their offices.  They also sold off a lot of their old equipment including their six twelve cylinder work trucks used to haul pipe and roughnecks back and forth from the rigs.

Since every oil company needs work vehicles in order to operate, the owners used their increased liquidity of $10,000 derived from the sell off of their high interest assets through 1989 to replace the six trucks with ten brand new 1990 Yugo GV's.   They had each GV custom outfitted with desert high beams and tow hitches capable of supporting a one ton trailer.  Their factory suspensions were also replaced with half-foot lift kits and desert traction tires.

I'll never forget the morning that the Yugos were delivered.  I was driving my own Jeep Wrangler down the old dirt road leading out to the one story metal building that made up the companies offices when I first caught sight of them.  Cresting the slope of a small arroyo I slammed on the brakes and slid to a stop, my mouth agape.  In the distance ten custom fitted Yugos sat lining the perimeter of the gravel parking lot.  

I stayed there at the lip of the arroyo a moment basking in the Yugos collective brilliance.  As the morning sun crept over the horizon their paint flashed magically across the burnt prairie basin like a beacon in a sea of brown.  I could see a crowd of roughnecks gathered at the front of the line of cars appraising them respectfully.

&quot;Wow.&quot;  I said, my voice almost a whisper.

I pulled into the parking lot and shut off my Jeep just as a fight was starting to break out.  Roughnecks for the most part are a friendly group of fellows to be around but they're very opinionated and stubborn when they want to be.  

Running over to the men I pulled them apart with the help of my best friend Red.  &quot;Come on boy's.&quot;  I said holding one of them by the arms while Red held the other.  &quot;What's the matter here?&quot;

&quot;Mack won't let me drive the Yugo.&quot;  Rusty McHaney said eyeing his brother with daggers in his eyes.

&quot;I'll let you drive when it's a cold day in hell.&quot;  Mack McHaney said returning his brother's stare.  

It seemed that Rusty and Mack McHaney, two brawny red faced brothers who worked as a pair out on rig number 5 had gotten into an argument over who was going to be the first one to drive the men and materials out to the rig that day.  They had both wanted to be the first behind the wheel of the brand new Yugo that was designated for their crew.  Neither one wanted to back down on the issue so they decided to settle their debate with fist.   

After getting the brothers calmed down Red and I convinced them that the argument should be settled by a coin toss.  We gave them two out of three and Rusty one.  Mack walked back to the work shed to begin loading pipes onto a trailer cursing softly beneath his breath while Rusty ran gleefully towards the office to check out his key for the day.  

&quot;Whelp son, I guess we should settle who's gonna be our morning driver the same way.&quot;  Red said bending down to pick up his quarter from the pavement.  

Red and I worked together on rig number 3 with a crew of 2 other roughnecks.  Red had a pleasant easy going way about him, which I liked.  While Red was technically my foreman we had both worked together for so long that we regarded one another as equal friends rather than him as my boss and me as his subordinate.

I was glad that Red had decided to settle who the morning driver was going to be in such a fair manner.  He could have tried to use his position to be the first behind the wheel of the supped up four cylinder Yugo GV but that just wasn't Red's style.

Red tossed the coin in the air.  &quot;Call it.&quot;  He muttered spitting a wad of tobacco on the ground.

&quot;Heads!&quot;  I shouted anticipating the fall of the coin.

As the quarter clinked upon the ground we both leaned over to check it blocking out the sun and throwing the coin into shadows.  Squinting through the darkness cast by our shadows I could barely make out the face of the coin.  It was heads.  

We repeated the ritual of Red tossing the Quarter into the air as I called it two more times.  Each time I would call heads.  I only lost once.

I was to be the first to drive the Yugo.

As we headed back to the shed to pack our various lengths of pipe and drilling bits into the trailer I beamed with excitement at the prospect of driving an actual Yugo.  I had read about them often during the years. I would sometimes lay awake at night dreaming of the day that I would be able to climb behind the wheel of one of these Yugoslavian works of automotive perfection and turn the key in the ignition.  

My head was in the clouds as I helped carry the pipe from the storage racks to the trailer's bed.  

The 1990 Yugo GV comes standard with four wheels and an engine.  Having no glove compartment and no radio to speak of the Yugo GV more than makes up for it inadequacies with it's four cylinder engine capable of reaching 67 horsepower with 74 displaced torque.  The Yugo GV is sold as a two-door hatchback capable of seating four midgets.  It retails for around $900 on today's market and gets about 24 miles to the gallon.

&quot;You unlock the trailer from the dock while I go get the keys to the car.&quot;  Red said, gesturing towards the steel chain that was wrapped around a trailer dock mounted to the side of the building in order to prevent theft.

&quot;Alright.&quot;  I said extracting my keys and taking a moment to appreciate the beauty of the Yugo GV. 

I stood there, my heart pounding in my chest as I regard the elegant lines of the boxy little car.  It was a magnificent creation.   The Yugo GV was a product of perfection according to the strict standards of 1940's manufacturing in the former Communist republic of Yugoslavia.  Sturdy, dependable, and rugged; the Yugo GV was everything a roughneck dreams of in a work car.

I was still standing there awestruck by the Yugo when Red came to my side.  &quot;Here's the keys son.&quot;  He said dropping them in my hand.  &quot;Why don't you go back that monster up and let's get her hooked up to the trailer.&quot;

Walking out to the Yugo, I could hear the other roughnecks starting their own work cars.  Soon the thunderous roar of nine Yugo 1.3 liter four cylinder engines filled the air around me.  Jamming them down into gear my work mates spun tires on the dusty gravel backing up to mount their own trailers to their one ton hitches.

Walking through the dust kicked up by the stampede of Yugos across the parking lot, I unlocked the door and squeezed myself behind the wheel.  With my knees resting comfortably up near my neck, I started the Yugo.  The engine emanated a satisfying hum as it churned into ignition.

Jamming her down into gear I backed up to the lip of the trailer marveling at the smooth ride of the Yugo GV.  The suspension mildly bumped and shook as the wheels sped across the tiny pellets of gravel covering the parking lot.  I listened to the strong seams of the frame rattling around me as I slowed to a stop and watched Red and another roughneck named Gonzales lock the trailer into place.

Flashing me a thumbs up sign in the rearview mirror, Red indicated that it was time to go.  Looking out the front window I could see the other crews pulling out of the parking lot and speeding across the fields out in the direction of their own rigs.  The Yugos resembled sturdy workhorses pulling wagons across the west as the bumped over hills towing their trailers full of men and pipe, their number spreading in every direction as the crews split up.

Jamming her down into gear I laid on the accelerator, the engine protesting mildly as I did so.  I stood on the gas, the tires spinning madly beneath me.  For some strange reason no matter how hard I pressed on the accelerator the Yugo never moved.  With the smell of burnt rubber filling the air around me the tiny car careened back and forth fighting against the tension of the trailer.  As the engine whined, I suddenly realized why I was going nowhere.  I realized why I was going nowhere too late.

I realized that I had forgotten to unlock the chain on the back of the trailer from the dock.  My poor Yugo was trying to pull the weight of the entire building.  Suddenly as the tires bit in to the ground it did just that.  It pulled the entire building from its very foundation.  Hearing the shriek of metal screaming out behind me like a siren I turned to see the entire metal building coming down behind me.  

A huge steel beam popped from the side of the building crushing the trailer and several of the men in it.  As I leapt from the car an entire wall fell over, completely decimating the Yugo, the trailer, and all the men in it.

With the Yugo flattened the engine sputtered to a halt.  Silence filled the air around me save for the tormented screams of the more than thirty-five people trapped beneath the rubble of the collapsed building.  Red was obviously dead.  I had seen him fall beneath a behemoth mountain of twisted steel that spilled from the demolished building.  

Morning the loss of my best friend and trying to block out the agonized screams of the survivors trapped in the building I couldn't help but marvel at what an amazing car the Yugo GV was.
