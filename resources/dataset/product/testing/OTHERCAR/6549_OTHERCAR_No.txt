            I bought this vehicle nearly 3 years ago because I believed it was economical, safe and feasible for my six person family. Today, after 29,000 miles and 30 months of usage out of my 1997 Dodge Caravan, I have been terribly disappointed in the product's durability, specifically its brakes. I have had my brakes fixed, whether it be pads, shoes, rotors or calipers no less than 7 times since purchasing this vehicle. I could understand perhaps if we weren't a two car family, or if we hadn't been very mindful of not overusing the minivan, but we have done everything possible to maintain this vehicle, yet EVERY 4-6 months we need brake work. Buyers looking to take advantage of Dodge Caravan's 4-cylinder engine in hopes of getting more miles to the gallon, forget that notion also, our 1993 Subaru Impreza nearly doubles the Caravan's mpg and we've only had brake work once in the six years (73,000 mi) we've had it. It is also front wheel drive like the Caravan. We've been told by the same person who fixes our brakes that because of the way the Caravan is made, they will continue to get frequent visits from owners of them. We've had enough. Braking up may be hard, but sometimes you gotta do, what you gotta do.  <br><br>
