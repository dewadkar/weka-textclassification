            The volkswagon passat is one of the best deals for a mid size car on the road today.  This car comes with most options built into the price, and the few options that are available are pretty reasonable.  The car handles like a dream, but i prefer a little more horsepower under the hood and a four wheel drive version to knock audi right out.  The looks of the passat have a expensive style to it, with out the price tag.  The car also has a great reliability factor which brings most volswagon customers back for more.  All in all this car is a gem in a world of dull rocks.<br><br>
