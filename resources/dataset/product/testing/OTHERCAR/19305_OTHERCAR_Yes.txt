            My wife bought me this camera a few weeks before our baby was born so that we could instantly share pictures of our first born to family that is spread throughout the country.  She knows my penchant for researching all purchases, so presented me with the &quot;O.K&quot; to go buy one after doing my research.

So, to the internet (epinions of course!) and to a local camera store (Camera World) I went.  Why did I end up with the <b><i>Fuji FinePix 1400?</i></b>  Price, functionality and quality.

<b>Price</b>
Retail for the FinePix 1400 is $290, but I found it at the Chase Manhattan shopping site for $190.  Even with a couple of upgrades (32MB Flash Card, 8 rechargeable batteries and a charger), my price was still under the retail price.  My wife had put me on a $300 budget, so this was perfect for me.  I found that digital cameras run in the $200 - $900 range.  I was very surprised that my $190 bought such a fine camera.

<b>Features</b>
The Fuji FinePix 1400 comes standard with the following:

<i>3x Autofocus Power Zoom</i> -- Perfectly fine for any indoor/household type zooming needs.  Not great for trying to zoom in on a wide receiver on a football field, however.

<i>4MB SmartMedia Storage Card</i> -- This only holds about 15 or 18 pictures, so unless you download pictures after every picture-taking session, you'll want to upgrade this to a 32MB version.  You can find a 32MB Card for about $50 on eBay, and this will hold about 150 pictures.  More than enough to get you through several photo sessions.

<i>1280 x 960-Image File Resolution</i> -- Good resolution for pictures up to 5x7.  If you're interested in blowing your pictures up to 8x10 or larger, I'd recommend a camera with a higher resolution.  However, I'm perfectly happy with the FinePix's resolution for my everyday/internet sharing purposes.  I have developed one of the pictures in 8x10 format, and although it looks good from a distance, you can really see the pixels up close.

<i>1.6-inch Liquid Crystal Display</i> -- Awesome!  You take a picture and 1/2 second later it is shown on this incredibly sharp display.  Not only that, but you can choose to view from this so you can take pictures without having your eye directly on the viewfinder.  It's like a little video camera (but not recording).  When viewing a picture, you can zoom in and out and the display exposes new levels of detail upon each closer zoom.  

<i>Multi-Frame Playback Feature</i> -- Lots and lots of options on how to view pictures.  One by one, thumbnails, zoomed in, zoomed out, etc.  You can also lock photos so they aren't inadvertently deleted.  Navigating through the pictures is very easy, and the buttons to do so are clearly marked and large enough to accommodate large fingers.

<i>USB enabled</i> -- This is very important to get.  Do not buy serial cable cameras, as it takes FOREVER to port to a computer.  The USB cable is lightening fast.  To view the 120 pictures on my camera right now, it only takes about 3 seconds for all to load.  The software Fuji provides is simple to install and simple to use.  Consists of a driver for Windows 98 or Windows 2000, a photo editor and a photo viewer.  I've never used the photo editor, however, because I'm a fan of Microsoft's PhotoDraw 2000 Version 2.0.  PhotoDraw has more than enough to alter/enhance/crop digital photographs.

<b>Batteries</b>
Don't even think of using regular batteries with this camera, or any digital camera.  The Liquid Crystal Display will eat through 4 AA batteries in a matter of minutes.  You should invest in the $25-$40 for a battery charger and nickel cadmium batteries.  I suggest you buy 8 batteries so you always have a back up set handy.  You can get a great deal on eBay for a package deal (charger and batteries) for about $35 usually.

<b>Conclusion</b>
I'm very happy with the Fuji FinePix 1400.  I've been able to share many pictures of my new son with my family over the internet, and even printed a bunch (through SnapFish.com) to send with the birth announcement.  We've gotten nothing buy rave reviews.  I feel like I got a quality, mid-range camera for a low-end price.<br><br>
