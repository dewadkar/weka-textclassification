            I was enticed by the e-photo through a deal that was running at the local CompUSA about a year ago.  They were offering a $100 instant rebate on the camera which made the selling price an attractive $199.  

I knew what I was buying, but didn't anticipate that one key feature which was missing would end up being so important.  The lack of a zoom on the camera makes it useful for barely more than close ups where the subject is less than 3 feet away, or for large scenery shots, where there is little need for detail.

The camera functions very well, although I did have some problems initially with the camera shutting off, but I was lead to believe upon contacting Agfa that it was due to the type of batteries I was using (Alkaline only)  It does eat batteries like they are candy, I suggest for extended shooting if you are near an outlet that you get an AC adapter.  

Another nice feature is the cable that is included for displaying through a video connection to a television.  This was a big hit at my mother-in-law's birthday party, I got to show everyone the pictures I had just taken.  

The software is very easy to use and connecting the camera is a snap, however, since it uses a com port instead of USB, it may cause conflicts with other com port devices, such as a Palm Pilot (which I own) if you only have one com port (which I do).  This leads to swapping cables and restarting.  One solution is to add additional ports using an add in card that can be purchased at most computer retailers.  As USB becomes more and more popular, someone who has com port devices may be forced to either add a card or buy new devices.

Don't expect to get photo quality prints from this camera, even with higher quality paper and a printer, the image quality even at the highest setting is such that you will not get what could be considered comparable to processed photos.  It's a nice camera for posting pictures to the web, or for family calendars and things of that nature.

For the price I paid, I am not terribly disappointed with the camera, however, I wish I would have saved up some more and waited a little while and gotten a higher end model.  Two items that would have made this an excellent camera would have been the zoom capability and USB connectivity.  I would suggest that potential buyers of digital cameras try to gravitate towards those two options, even if they are buying an entry level camera (as long as you have a USB port, obviously).<br><br>
