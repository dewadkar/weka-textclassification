            I have owned my '01 Pathfinder for almost a year now and I just love it. I previously owned a '97 GMC Jimmy and the difference in many instances is night and day. The first thing that I noticed about the Nissan is the quality of the workmanship. Everything looked refined, no screws or cheep plastic parts were observed. After a year of ownership, I have not had one problem with the truck, except for Oil-Changes, no other service calls have been made on it. The ride on my SE feels very smooth and carlike, and for a SUV, is fairly quiet, with no squeeking noises coming from the truck. Steering feels very good, however the breaks are a little touchy. One of my favorate things is the first class Bose Stereo that came installed. The sound quality is excelent and the 6-disc CD changer is something that I can't go without now. 

The biggest negative about the Nissan is the cramped rear seat. It would be hard for 2 average sized adults to travel for a long period in the back seats. However, the rear seats do recline to give some releif. But if their is luggage in the cargo area, this feature would be useless.

Overall this is a great SUV, high quality and very nice ride. You must put this one on your test-drive list.
