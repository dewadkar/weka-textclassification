            I bought my '91 Pathfinder (with 105K miles) about 2 years ago to support my growing snowboarding addiction as well as give myself extra versatility and space for camping/biking and generic road trips.  Primary factors on choosing the car were (obviously) its versatility and reputation for hassle-free ownership.  On those counts, it has delivered admirably.  The only exceptional repair items I've done are new shocks and a new muffler (not bad for a 9 year old veteran).  If you're an outdoorsy type person on a budget, picking up a used Pathfinder could be a great value.  I'll give you the pros &amp; cons to help you make your most informed decision.

PROS:

Great Styling.  I always liked the older-model Pathfinders.  The car still cleans up very nicely.

Reliable.  All the major mechanicals have performed &quot;like new&quot;.  The car does have a few quirks, squeaks, and rattles, but my filling it with all manner of stuff and dragging it on mountain trips haven't helped matters.

Versatile.  The car offers multiple tie-downs, pockets, and indentations for storing all your stuff.  The glove compartment is huge.  The back seats fold down 50-50 so you can fit more stuff inside and still carry a third passenger.  The back seats also recline.  This truck will carry anything.  I've gotten it to swallow a recliner with room for my groceries.

Good Automatic.  The transmission has worked well and seems to shift at all the right times (though it doesn't have that much engine to work with).

Great Brakes.  The ABS has helped me out in several situations

Ground Clearance.  This thing has gotten over rocks, curbs, &amp; other obstacles I never thought it'd clear.  Gives you a nice &quot;above the world&quot; driving position.

Maneuverability.  The Pathfinder maneuvers well in tight spaces for a vehicle its size, though the tire carrier on back still causes me parallel parking problems.

CONS:

Underpowered.  Although this is a V6, the engine is barely adequate.  Don't plan on passing on any sustained slopes.  In high altitude, the engine weakness is even more pronounced.  With such a weak engine, the cruise control cannot be used on anything more than a slight grade without having the transmission hunt for gears.  A 5-speed may help you get more out of what you get, especially the lower end torque.

Handling / Steering.  Granted my basis for comparison is largely from my experience with passenger cars, but the Pathfinder's steering is amazingly numb/vague.  The wheel can be jiggled about 15 degrees in either direction without affecting the direction of the vehicle.  At times (freeway speeds over 70) it's almost unsafe.

Cornering.  This is a truck.  Don't forget it.

Noise.  Pathfinders are fairly noisy, especially at freeway speeds with the combination of a slightly overmatched engine and wind.

Mileage.  Poor (~15-16 MPG).  Not good given the lack of power.

Ergonomics.  Some of the buttons/switches are in awkward places.  None are lit for nighttime use.  No cupholders.  Poorly placed stereo.

Uncomfortable back seats.  Back seats are tight for anyone with longer legs.

Safety.  This is an older model and as such does not have all the safety features you would expect, like airbags and reinforced side impact beams.

Weak roof rack.  The roof rack is only rated for 50lbs.  Not too big of a deal if you're carrying snowboards, but if you want a luggage carrier or plan on carrying more than one bike, you'll need to invest in a more substantial setup, like a Yakima rack.


All told, may Pathfinder definitely gets the job done with a minimum amount of effort from me but it doesn't do a whole lot more.  It's a good value so long as you understand what you're getting.
