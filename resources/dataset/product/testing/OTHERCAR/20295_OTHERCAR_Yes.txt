            My family had an 89 Ford Taurus for a while (and we still do), but last year we decided it was time for a second car, so we bought a Nissan Sentra. It is a wonderful little car, well worth the price. After over a year, it still seems brand new. The transmission works perfectly (I love stick shift), as does everything else. Maintaining it is easy, and Nissan will do most repairs for you for free on a lease (not that we need them - the car works fine!)<br><br>
