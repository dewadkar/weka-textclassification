            Ahhh the sweet, sweet sound of an SUV going down the street.  Make no mistake about it, this SUV is power incarnate.  A better name for this SUV is Dodge Triple Plated.  Frankly speaking, I don't see how a car can penetrate this plating :).

Seriously though, this SUV owns.  It travels a good distance on the gallon, ~14 for the Highway and ~12 for city travel.  Considering its over 6 tons, I find it great.  It's interior is incredibly spacious.  You can fit a family of 6 and their suitcases without much trouble.  4 wheel drive, and anti lock brakes insures that its the best on the road.  You will feel safe in this car.  No matter what.

Of all driving, winter driving is the worst.  I can safely say that this car is the equivalant of a savior in cold weather.  This spring break, I had the pleasure to visit the Yukon Terrioty in my new Durango.  It puverlized the snow.  Literally.  I had no fears traveling in the snow.  It was safe.  Period.

Comfort.  That 1 word can sell hundreds of thousands of cars.  This SUV is comfortable.  Let me rephrase that, it's the most comfortable SUV I have ever driven.  It's plush leather seats, 2 way heating and air conditioning and its eye-forgiving display planel epitomizes comfort.  I feel as if it's my second home.  It's that comfortable.  All I need is a fridge and a TV and I'd rather live there :).   

There are some downsides though.  This thing chugs gas like you would chug beer.  It's non-stop.  I have spent over 50 dollars filling up this monster's tank.  It's worth it though.  It can go ~400 miles per a tank so its not bad.  But if you do a lot of city travel, this isn't for you.  This bad-boy will be hell to find a parking spot for.  But if you do a lot of suburban travel and highway, this is the SUV for you.  Hands down.
