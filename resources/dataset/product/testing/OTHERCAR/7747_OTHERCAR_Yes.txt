            What better advice about the neon, than from someone who drives one?
I got the neon in christmas of 96', and let me tell you i never thought it would last.  My mom was in line for a new car, so she bought me one too.  I loved my nissan maxima, but the neon was gonna have to do.  After driving it for a while it was quite comfy.  The car itself handled awesome.  The gas mileage on it is great, road trips are perfect for this car.  and if you are a high school student or just starting out college student, this car is top of the line.  Small, sleek, affordable, mine only cost 13,500.  4 and a half years later and my neon is still running like a dream. And the 4 cylinder engine they put in that car, oh my god, it has got some speed under that hood.  It's like a hopped up 2.0 liter engine.  Gets me out of tight situations like no other car i have ever driven.  Not much i dislike about this car, except for the material it is made out of.  Mostly plastic and fiberglass with a reinforced steel frame going around the skeleton of the car,  but if you are in a serious accident with this car, better buckle up.  The back of the car is very light weight, making sharp turns on wet streets will easily make the back tires fishtale.  Other than that i would highly recommend this car to any young or middle aged person.<br><br>
