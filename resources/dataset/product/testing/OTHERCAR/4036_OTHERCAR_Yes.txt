            The Tahoe is a great addition to the cars roaming the roads. It is a awesome SUV that can basically go anywhere. It gets pretty good gas per the mile, and looks great. The Tahoe basically drives like a car, but can basically go anywhere, even if it is not 4 wheel drive. If it is, you could have a lot of fun. I personally prefer the old body style's of this type of vehicle, for example a 1997 version or even 1999. What I do enjoy is the push button for getting into 4 wheel drive instead of using the stick. It makes it a lot easier.

The tahoe really is no different from the GMC Yukon, because the look the same, except for the name on the back. Everything else is exactly the same. My friend has one of these and he seems to enjoy it just as I enjoy my Tahoe. There is one problem with this model, and that is that the breaks seem to wear down easier than on other vehicles, but that could be fixed. It is not that they will go out, its just the fact that they squeek.<br><br>
