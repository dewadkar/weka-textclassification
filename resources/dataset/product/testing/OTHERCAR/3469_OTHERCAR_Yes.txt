            Our taupe colored 2000 Bonneville has a cloth interior that is a little funky.  By that, I mean different.  It is a swirled fabric, which may gear your thought to an older couple.  But, that is the only thing slow about this car!  With 45,000 miles on it, we got it for $12,000.  What a deal!  

The front of the Bonneville is scooped out now.  The dash is broader and the front end seems to take up more room in the entire vehicle.  We measured our 1994 to compare, and by golly, they are the same length!  The wheel base seems smaller, but this car drives so snappily, it's a nice change.

With a CD player and a stereo system you can set yourself, the vehicle is not fancy.  No sun or moon roof, but good air vents, and comfortable heating.  The color of this is more attractive than our entirely red vehicle of old.  

There are features missing:  storage "sacks" behind passenger seat for maps, snacks, etc....head room seems sparce.  But in all, this is a nicely carpeted, non-digital readout vehicle that is attractive and moves nicely.  Hard to gage gas mileage, but filling it is expensive at the rate gas prices are climbing.  Still a good mileage vehicle and good to take customers in.

Recommend this as a medium size sedan for a couple, a small family, or anyone needing good, solid transportation with a little perk.  Wheel base good on turns, too, and in slick areas.  Dry snow can cause slippage.
