            A friend of mine owns a Pontiac Grand Am and seems to like it but I'm not sure.  I'm not sure if I like it either.  It is a good car and everything but it's just not my style.  The car gets good handling even in rainy weather and other conditions.  Also, it has a fair amount of room in the back seats as well as the front and driver side.  One thing that is cool about this car though is all the buttons and the speedometer are illuminated in red instead of the same old green I'm used to seeing.  That's one thing I never get tired of.  There are two things that really bug me about this car though.  One, out of the blue one day the side panel of the car fell right off.  No one knows how or why, it just fell off.  Luckily it was able to be replaced at minimal cost.  Also, when the car is in reverse, it makes a funny clicking sound in the engine.  Once again, we don't know how or why, it just does.  You can't let these flaws get in your way from checking one out though seeing as how both problems are probably due to reckless driving.  The Pontiac Grand Am is a perfect car for a family, a business man, or an all around economical person.<br><br>
