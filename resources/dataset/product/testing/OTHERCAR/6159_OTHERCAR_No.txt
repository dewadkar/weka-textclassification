            In the summer of 1999, my uncle purchased a 1999 Chevrolet Venture 7 passenger minivan. It is beige in color, and is the short wheelbase model.

Outside, the Venture is pleasing to the eye. The roof rack and chrome grill really set off this van. The tail lights are stylish and well positioned.

Inside the Venture, is a well laid out dash, with the radio positioned above the climate controls. Everything is in easy reach and right where you need it. The radio buttons are of low quality plastic, and are awkward to use. The climate controls, however, are very ergonomically designed and are pleasant to use. There are cup holders and storage spaces everywhere (and anywhere) you need them. The front bucket seats are almost perfect, and the armrests are a nice touch. The middle row and rear seats are also very comfortable, and the &quot;theater seating&quot; is great for small passengers in the back who like to see the road. There is ample cargo space in the luggage compartment, although there is room for many knick-knacks in the vehicle with the passengers. The driving position is odd for shorter people like me. The seat back must be reclined uncomfortably away from the airbag for maximum safety. Speaking of safety, the Pontiac Trans Sport (a Chevrolet Venture with Pontiac badges) did very poorly in an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash test into an offset barrier. This information is enough for me to stay clear of the Venture and similar Pontiac Trans Sport/Oldsmobile Silhouette.

This van rides as if it were floating on a cloud. There is hardly any road noise, and the beefy 15-inch tires and suspension transform those nasty bumps to small vibrations. The engine supplies just a bit more than enough horsepower and torque, and it is no slouch when passing or when merging on the highway. It is easy to maneuver through alleyways and parking lots, but the slanted front end makes judging distances while parking quite cumbersome. The 4-speed automatic transmission shifts unbelievably smoothly; you'd think you were driving a Lexus.

Reliability has been very good. The only problems encountered so far were minor brake adjustments.

I think the Venture is unmatched by any other domestic minivan in reliability, power, and handling. But, if you are considering buying a Venture, Trans Sport, or Silhouette, remember that they did exceptionally poor in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash testing. If you are concerned for the safety of yourself and loved ones, don't buy a Venture. The Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey both did very well in crash tests, and have bulletproof reliability. If Chevy would improve the Venture's crashworthiness, I think it would be the domestic minivan of choice. But until then, I suggest you look elsewhere. <br><br>
