                When I turned sixteen I got a 1989 Toyota Celica.  Well it was something to drive!  When I turned seventeen I got a 1992 Nissan Maxima and drove it until I bought my 1999 Grand Am.  The car is great, sporty look on the outside and inside.  And even though it is sporty on the inside there is still TONS of room.  Lots and lots of trunk room.  I paid a little more than I should have for it, but I was new at buying cars and you know how those salesman can be.  I don't regret buying it however.  I have had my car for 5 months and still get excited about driving it.  This car will fly, and it does it so smoothly.  It is one of the best riding and driving cars I have seen.  The car is so easy to control!  I highly recommend investing in a GRAND!! Am.<br><br>
