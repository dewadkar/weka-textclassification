    I have a 91 chevy corsica. I never new a car could go though so much as my car been through. I bought the car in 98 for 3,000 dollars. Within six months of buying the car a 18 wheeler hits it did 1,000 dollars worth of damage to the car, i was lucky with that on. One month later it was wrecked again. Since we live on a private lane i would let my daughter drive it up and down the lane. We just came back from the laundry mat, and was hanging up blankets on the line, and she asked if she could park the car. So not thinking much of it i said go ahead, and went into the house. Walked back to my room to make the bed, when i see her pulling the car in like a manic, and almost drive it into this ditch which has spring water running through it. I run out side to ask her what her problem was, load and behold one big dent in both passenger doors. She hit the old stone wall to the old house. I wanted to scream(MY CAR). She was so upset, she knew how much this car ment to me. So i took a deep breath, and got my temper under control, so i could talk to her. Now we tell every one that the wall jumped out to say hi to the car. new doors for the car 400.00 dollars, a piece.
      Most woman think men should know how to work on cars, woman don't believe this, because i know more about cars than my husband does. Told him back in October of last year that the battery light kept coming on, that there was soming wrong with the car(i know older car engine didn't know anything about this one well maybe a little. He told me it was just a lose wire, because ever time we'd go over a bump the battery light would come on, so i figured he was a man he would know, boy was i wrong.A couple of weeks later, five miles from where i worked she died on me, had to walk to work. Later that day we went to get the car and he says oh it the altinator, worked on it until 11pm that night. When one thing goes wrong they all go wrong. For the past seven months my poor chevy has been sitting in the driveway. It over heated and water got in the oil and blew the gasgets, my so called husband the machinic tried to fix it bent one push rod snapped another in half. Had them in wrong(ha,ha) Fixed that finish putting the car back together she wouldn't start. Found out we had to get the gas to intake. You got it still wouldn't start. He finally got enough brains and had it towed to a garage. They got it started,but the values are messed up because of the push rods. The cost to repair that 1,000 dolars. You would think that i learned my lesson and not let my husband work on my car, not. Since he wrecked his car and 7,000 dollars worth of damage, we have to do the work ourselves. PRAY FOR MY CAR PLEASE!<br><br>
