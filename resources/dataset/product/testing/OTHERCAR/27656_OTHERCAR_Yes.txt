                 The Hyundai generally has a bad rap; I know this because I've worked in the auto finance industry for over five years.  Some of my competitors WILL NOT finance them for even those who might have perfect credit.  While, this brand of car does not hold it's value like a Honda or Toyota, it holds up to a lot of wear &amp; tear.
     I bought mine brand new in 1995; it only had 10 miles on it.  Since then, I have driven over 85,000 miles in it, without a single breakdown.  I make sure it gets the occasional oil change, have replaced the tires once, the brakes once &amp; every other minor maintenance requirement has been covered &quot;free of charge&quot; by the manufacturer's warranty.  What more can you really ask of such an economical car?  It's never let me down.
     Although options aren't exactly an option because power features aren't offered on the accent, I haven't really missed them.  I can roll down my own window, unlock my own doors, keep my foot on the gas pedal &amp; stay nice &amp; cool behind the cool air pumped from my air conditioning.  All any car really needs is air conditioning and the ability to get us where we want to go.  
     If you're looking for luxury, obviously you wouldn't be considering the Hyundai Accent.  But, if economy, reliability, &amp; low-maintenance are some things you want in your next car, definitely look into the Accent.<br><br>
