            Imagine with me, if you will, a game of  <b>&quot;King of the Mountain&quot;</b> that is taking place within the relatively new mini-ute market. There was a time when things were calm on the warfront, with the toy-like Suzuki Sidekick and the aged Jeep Cherokee as the top choices. In 1996, the RAV4 took over by storm, and fared much better than even Toyota had anticipated. In 1997, the new Honda CR-V reigned supreme, toppling RAV4 sales. What's more, 1999 seemed even more promising with a horsepower boost and an available manual transmission for the CR-V. By this time, however, new players had come to play in the market, namely the brand-new Suzuki Grand Vitara, the Kia Sportage, and the Subaru Forester. With each player fighting to get to the top, the game of King of the Mountain was about to get ugly... 

It was around this time that I happened to be shopping for a mini-SUV. My choices were the CR-V, Suzuki Grand Vitara, Subaru Forester, and Toyota RAV4.

SO, IS HONDA STILL THE KING?
Allow me to explain my weekend get-away test drive with the 1999 Honda CR-V before I tell you my conclusions... :)

<b>EXTERIOR:  7</b>
   When my friend at the Honda/Acura dealership handed me the keys (remote key-less entry, BTW), I walked around the CR-V. It was certainly a handsome vehicle. Cute, but not as cute as the RAV4, probably because of its larger size. I only had the Toyota for about an hour, by the way- I don't have any Toyota dealers as friends... yet! :-(    From the outside, you would not guess that this vehicle is actually based on the Honda Civic platform, which it is. And yet, I would not characterize the CR-V as rugged-looking- or fun, even. The boxy frame looked more to me like a raised station wagon than an SUV, giving it a rather <b>bland yet functional appearance</b>. Of course, looks aren't everything, and these observations are merely my own opinion.

<b>INTERIOR:  9</b>
   Sitting in the interior, <b>I was amazed at the lengths that Honda went through to ecomomize space</b>. There is gobs of it in this little SUV, even in the back seat, which is equipped with a center armrest. In their quest, Honda did a few weird things: first of all, the driver's power window switches are on the DASH to the left of the steering wheel. The trade-off for this is that the inside of the door is a bit too narrow for you to rest your elbow on while you drive, not to mention the fact that the button placement takes a little getting used to. 
The gearshift is on the steering column, not on the floor- this freed up space for a center removable tray (and cupholder) for rear access. A nice feature, this was also incorporated into their all-new Honda Odyssey mini-van. 
The CR-V has no standard passenger armrest, but neither do any other cars in its class. It is available as an option. Speaking of options, I was disappointed that a cargo cover to conceal valuable items was an option for the car. That sort of thing should be standard in my opinion. 
The dash of the CR-V screams Honda. Practical, practical, practical. Everything is easy to use, and within reach. The dash is very similar to the Honda Civic (surprised?). The styling inside matches the exterior: no real flavor to it- just functional.
A couple of goodies add some spice to the interior like an integrated cooler and picnic table in the rear. Nifty- I can see how some people would be attracted to that. Personally, I didn't see myself using them a whole lot (what, no chairs?!). 
My advice to those who live in hot climates: if you're going to buy a CR-V, get a white one. I had the &quot;electron blue&quot; color, and the A/C took a while to cool the spacious cabin... 

<b>ENGINE:   6</b>
   The dealer that I went to was located on a busy highway, with a short entrance ramp for access. I was hopeful that the new horsepower boost for the CR-V would be able to handle the task. It did, but made a ruckus the whole time. I was <b>disappointed by the lack of power</b> despite the upgrade.  On the way home, there was a one-lane highway that I had to go across. And wouldn't you know it, there was a small Ford Festiva loaded down with people, going under 45mph. I hit the gas to pass it. The automatic was hesitant, but I passed the car eventually. The experience really confirmed my belief that this car needed a bigger motor, perhaps even a V6. It is at times like these that power (or lack thereof) can mean the difference between life and death.

<b>RIDE AND HANDLING:   7</b>
   The CR-V has good attributes when you are not praying for more power. <b>On the road, the CR-V shines</b>, riding much like a car. Its suspension is not too cushy, nor is it sporty- it's just right. At cruising speeds, the engine seems to complain a bit too much. I had to turn the radio up in order to hear it very well. (The radio needs work, by the way.) Emergency turning reminds you of its height, too. While it holds the road, the body leans a bit. Nothing alarming, however.
   
<b>ENOUGH ALREADY! SO IS IT THE &quot;KING OF THE MOUNTAIN&quot; OR NOT?:</b>
   Having read up on cars for a long time, I consider myself a tough critic on cars. Overall, however, I was impressed by the CR-V, and saw why it is doing so well. The <b>Suzuki Grand Vitara won my vote</b> in the end, however, placing the CR-V at second, the Forester third, and the RAV4 fourth. In my mind, the CR-V was edged out because the Grand Vitara offered power (a smooth V6), value, and capability that none of the others could match.
   I still recommend that you look at the CR-V, but encourage you to give a special look at the Suzuki Grand Vitara (check out my review of it on this site!), that is if less cargo space does not bother you too much. If it does, the CR-V may be for you. But in order for the CR-V to win MY vote, it needs more than just a Honda badge- namely more power and more emphasis on the &quot;FUN&quot; in &quot;functional.&quot;
