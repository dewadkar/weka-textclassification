            My last camera was the very first Elph, the APS predecessor to the S100.  I loved that camera, it was so tiny, I could put it in my pocket.  In fact, I always had it in my bag, wherever I went.

But then I started growing lazy, and the act of getting APS film developed all the time was cumbersome; I had to wait four days while the film went off to the lab and back.  I started looking at digital cameras, but they were still twice the size of my beloved Elph.  I swore that I wouldn't buy a digital camera until one came out that was the same size as my current Elph.

Then I found out about the S100 Digital Elph, and I went out and bought one online right away.  That's it, no research, no comparisons, I just saw the size, the features and the brand and based my decision entirely on that.  Granted, it may not have been the most intelligent of decisions, but I'm _very_ glad with the results.

Because this is my first digital camera, many of the features that I find so amazing may actually be standard, but the fact that they all fit into a camera so small continues to amaze me, and everyone else I show it to, for that matter.

The first set of pictures I took amazed me.  For such a small size, the flash on this camera is pretty powerful, at least close up.  I haven't tried any of the alternate flash modes, though, as some of them require a tripod.  The outdoor pictures were very clear; as one co-worker noticed, you could make out the license plates on the cars in the background of the test shots I made (perfect spy-cam!).

The USB interface is amazingly smooth.  After installation, the camera transfer is flawless, either to Photoshop or to the included application.  My only gripe is that on my PC, it has re-installed the drivers instead of recognizing the camera, but on my Mac at work it's seamless.  This is probably more a problem with my Windows 98, though.  At one point, I went from someone asking me online if I could take pictures, to having those pictures on my webpage in less than 5 minutes.  That's so much better than 4 days, and that's not even counting the time it would take to scan the pictures afterwards.

As for the camera itself, the numbers do all the talking.  The 2.1 Megapixel resolution is comparable to 400 ASA film, which is what I was using anyway.  The 2:1 optical zoom is also useful.  I haven't tried the macro mode yet.  The only gripe is that if you use the LCD a lot, the battery drains down very quickly.  Fortunately, the battery charger is portable, and extra batteries aren't large.  I need to buy one.

Another thing to keep in mind is that with the purchase of the camera, you get everything you need to use it, and nothing more.  All of the accessories are separate.  You don't even get a carrying case... but fortunately for me, the case that came with my old Elph fits it perfectly. :)  I also bought the AC adaptor kit, but I realized that it won't charge the battery inside the camera as I hoped.  Instead it's more useful as a backup power supply if you need to review/download pictures while the battery is charging.  I'd just recommend getting a second battery instead.

I also purchased a 48MB CompactFlash Card.  The 8MB it came with is not quite enough when dealing with the standard pictures.

As for construction, this thing seems very solid, the only &quot;flimsy&quot; thing about it is the battery cover: if the cover isn't snapped in fully though, the camera won't even turn on.  I dropped the camera about three feet last night onto concrete, and it scared me when it didn't turn on because the cover popped a little off.  Other than that, the camera was undamaged.  I'd recommend the carrying case though.

Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase, and I have already convinced one other person to buy one, after they saw it in use.  Now, if they could just come up with a new battery technology that's compatible, this could be the camera I use for a long time.
