            I got a Corolla over the summer, and I love it.  It drives well, even in bad weather.  In the summer, the AC was ice cold.  And now the heater hardly takes any time to warm up.  It is small enough to parallel park most anywhere, yet is so much bigger inside than it looks.  Especially the trunk space.  I am in college and I was able to fit everything I need for the year.  Also, I go home about once a month, and it is a long drive through the mountains the whole way.  A lot of cars can't handle the uphill and downhill, but it never slows down and still gets at least 25mpg.  I doubt I will have to get a new car anytime soon, but when I do a Corolla will be at the top of my list.
