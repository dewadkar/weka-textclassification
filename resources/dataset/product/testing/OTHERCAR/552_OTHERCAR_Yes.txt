            I just bought a 2000 Accent GL.  It's chile red, at first I didn't like the color but now that I've gotten used to it I like it.  I did a lot of research before buying this car and the general consensus seems to be its a good value.  My goal was to find a car with a budget of about $200 a month.  Hey, what can I say I'm still in college and I don't have a lot to spend on a car.  I looked at used Honda Civics, but someone suggested to me that for the price of a used civic I could get a new Accent with a much better warranty.  So I checked out a Hyundai dealer and a few days later I had my new car!

I got it for $205 a month, a tad over budget but I guess I'll have to sacrifice somewhere else in my budget.  It's one less 6 pack a month, no big deal.

So far so good, I'm happy with the way the car rides, it's a smooth and quiet ride.  I also like the extras that aren't usually standard on other small economy cars.  Like the cupholders, the intermittent wipers, the driver side arm rest, the adjustable seats, and the trunk and gas releases.  And for someone who is 6'3 like myself, the car is surprisingly roomy and comfortable.

My complaints are that the cassette player doesn't let me use a portable CD player with it, it ejects the adapter.  So I'm looking into buying a in-dash CD player, no big deal.  The engine quite frankly is wimpy, but what can you expect from a 1.5 liter 92 horsepower engine?!  Once it gets going its fine, and that's all that matters.  I don't plan on racing anyone, as long as I can get from point A to point B, I'm happy. 

This was my first new car buying experience, and I was surprised by the dealership.  I was expecting the sales guy to be a little more pushy and annoying, but he wasn't at all.  He was friendly and didn't try to get me into his office after my test drive.  I felt like the ball was in my court for most of the time.  So if your looking for a Hyundai in the upstate NY area, I suggest checking out Garvey Hyundai in Queensbury. 

Overall I'm pleased with my new car purchase.  It seems like a good value and might be an inexpensive car, but it doesn't feel, or look, cheap.

In a few months or so I'll stop back and let everyone know how things are going with the car and give an update.<br><br>
