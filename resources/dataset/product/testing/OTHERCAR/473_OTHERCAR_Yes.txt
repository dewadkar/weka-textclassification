            Let me start out by saying that I love my Monte Carlo.  It's probably the first new vehicle I bought, and I've had several, that I bought with me in mind.  Not because it was the lowest price or because I had to have a vehicle with alot of room.  Last year I made up my mind that by the time I turned 40, which was last August, I was going to buy the vehicle I wanted.  At first I was trying to decide between a sporty car, like a Camaro or something along the lines of the new Impala.  I didn't care for the Camaro because although it is sporty, I didn't like the way the seats felt when I sat down.  I felt like I was sitting on the ground.  Also my husband and I couldn't agree on how to have it loaded.  He wanted a convertible with the high performance package, which would have cost an arm and a leg, and I didn't.  So that took care of the Camaro.  I was really leaning more towards the Impala, but started to get impatient in wanting a new vehicle.

I went to the Chevrolet dealership where I used to work and started talking to my favorite salesman.  I told him I wanted a vehicle that had leather seats, a CD player, a sunroof, and looked sporty.  He told me he had two Monte Carlo's on the lot that fit that description.  So I test drove one, and fell in love with it immediately.  I liked the way it felt when I sat in it and loved the power it had when I drove it.

I've had my car now for almost a year and have no regrets about buying it.  I think I may keep this vehicle for quite a while.<br><br>
