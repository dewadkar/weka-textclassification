            <b>I absolutely love this camera.</b>

The quality is excellent, though the pictures usually need a little color adjustment in a graphics program (they are often washed out). I really, really like the optical viewfinder (as opposed to LCD), the upright 'larger' shape of the camera, and the zoom feature is easy to use and has a pretty good range.

I've been a person who frequently is so interested in the subject I'm shooting, that I inadvertently place my finger in front of the lens -- something which has yet to happen on this digital camera. The thumb holder is a little indulgent, but it helps me reposition my hands &amp; fingers when I'm starting to stray; thereby preserving that perfect shot of my gorgeous 2-year old daughter.

<b>Features:</b>

This camera has a LOT of features -- including an album feature (helps you organise and store pictures on the memory card), a watermark menu (lets you imprint text, date, time, logo (!) etc. on the picture), a focus menu (lets you pick the focus), and a picture type menu (timelapse, burst, still).  There is also a complicated batch of Kodak scripts that you can run, which I am completely clueless about, but which seem to be a wonderful thing to know how to do. There's a nifty feature that lets you choose the compression of your pictures - put it on the highest setting and it takes fewer pictures at a higher quality; lower it a bit and take more pictures at a good-average quality. You can also record sound to accompany your pictures - great fun!

The delay between the pushed button and the actual 'click' of the camera takes some getting used to -- I've gotten in the habit of pushing the button halfway down, then clicking fully to get the shot I want. I've been told this is a typical digital camera flaw, however, and I like this camera's ability to push the button halfway. Still, I -have- been frustrated when my daughter's adorable antics move faster than the camera can take pictures.

It is fantastically easy to plug into my G3 and I download it via photoshop.  It has a power cord adapter that I use when I'm stationary, and lots of room on the memory card. It's easy to carry around, but it isn't small enough  to fit into a pocket - we use a camera case. 

The battery life doesn't last long if you use the LCD screen a lot to view (or take) your pictures. I have extended the battery life up to three times as long simply by not scrolling through the pictures as I'm taking them, but rather waiting and scrolling through them all at once, at the end. We purchased 2 sets of the rechargeable AA batteries and the charger, so it's never a problem for us, anyway.

<b>Summary:</b>

I am not a professional photographer (by any stretch of the imagination), but this camera has helped me feel like one. I have promised myself that some day I'll sit down, really read the manual, and be able to successfully do all of the functions and miracles that this camera promises. Until that day, I'm pleased with the 2,000 pictures our camera has taken (can you imagine the cost of film and developing this would require for a manual camera?), and have been very delighted with the camera itself. If you can afford this camera, buy it - you won't regret the purchase. <br><br>
