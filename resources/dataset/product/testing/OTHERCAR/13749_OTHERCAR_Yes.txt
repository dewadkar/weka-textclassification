            This is the first camera I have ever used and am loving it.  I've been using it for about 2 months now and have had very few problems.  The 16 mb memory stick card it comes with is not enough.  I made the smart purchase of a 128 mb memory stick for a reasonable $70.  This allows me to hold about 65 photos all taken at the highest 5 megapixel quality.  Recharging the batteries does not take very long I have not timed it but have never had a problem.  Taking distant photos at night or with darkness comes out blurry.  The moon over the beach & ocean looked pear shaped.  Other than that, the flash in close range works very well in the dark and the options they offer for other picture settings do work well.  There are different flash options all of which I am not acquainted yet.  Daytime photos are tremendous.  The portability of the camera is great, fitting nicely into a small compartment in my backpack and snuggly into a jeans pocket if needed.  The lcd screen is a good indicator to know what you're shooting and how well it came out.  In reviewing your pictures it takes one second to become un-blurry when viewing so don't panic right away.  Deleting unwanted pictures is easy and you're able to free up more space.  I bought the Digital Photo Printer DPP-EX5 by Sony to make 4x6 prints.  This has worked out well and is darn near identical to 35mm store quality prints.  I bought the paper/ink cartridge combo packs online in bulk and the price isn't too bad for prints (@ 50 cents each).  Both the memory stick transfer of pictures to the computer and the supplied usb cable have worked well.  The quality of the pictures is as good I was hoping for for the $300 price tag.  It's been well worth it.
