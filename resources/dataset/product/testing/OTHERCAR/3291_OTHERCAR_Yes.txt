            This is an excellent car, and I would highly recommend it for several reasons. 

1. Compare the value. My Millenia, completely loaded, leather, power everything, and the bigger engine, moonroof, heated seats, incredible CD/cassette stereo system stickered for appx. $36,000. In March of 1998, I took advantage of an awesome lease deal $0 down (except 1st payment and security deposit), $389 a month for three years. For that payment, at that time similar deals were being offered on the following cars: Buick LeSabre (base model, Chrysler Concorde (base model), etc. with sticker prices appx. $12K-$14K less. A comparably priced BMW or Volvo at the time carried lease payments upward of $550/mo.It's my understanding that this same vehicle in 2000, has been reduced in price several thousand dollars. I expect that a purchase arrangement would have been equally inexpensive, although I didn't get quotes (my figure of $29,500 is what appears on the lease contract). The car seems very comparable to the much more expensive larger Lexus and Infinity products in ride, maneuvering, body and leg room etc. for many thousands less. In fact, I like this car better than the BMW 5 series, and it costs nowhere close.

2. The car drives great, and in Consumer Reports has an excellent repair record (both new and later) for the last several model years. That has also been my experience. In the nearly two years I've had the car, I have taken care of the regular oil changes &amp; checkups, but have had no other problems.

3. Mazda's customer service far exceeded what I have previously experienced. The staff at the dealership was friendly, and SURPRISE, the deal offered in the paper was not only good for 1 particular vehicle, but I had a choice of 16 cars with the same deal! After the sale, I have
been written to and called several times for my opinions by Mazda corporate, and by the dealer, as well as free oil changes, etc. With a bumper to bumper warranty, it seems I'm set. Service experiences (limited to oil changes and regular maintenance at the dealership have been pleasant, and are always followed up by a phone call from a member of management at the dealership.

4. The workmanship and quality of this vehicle is worthy of JD Powers honors, I believe, although I don't know where it came in on that list in '98. The leather is supple, the seats comfortable-- room for 5 adults with nice leg and headroom. The trunk is spacious-- seems larger than a 3-series BMW, Acura or Audi vehicle. Acceleration, cornering, and ride are what you would expect-- excellent, though some of my passengers say it's more cushy than the tight Mercedes kind of ride. This car is very much an Americanized drive-- as a luxury car should be.

All in all, the Mazda Millenia is a great, dependable luxury car at a super value. I will lease or buy another one in 2001 when this lease runs out!<br><br>
