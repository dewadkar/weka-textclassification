            Toyota Supra, just listen to it. It sounds like an amazing car. Whenever someone tells me they own a Toyota Supra, I get in to a state of awe. I have always thought highly of them. They look great, drive great, feel great, and are great. The Supra has a lot of muscle, it can drive amazingly fast with great acceleration. It also comes with an incredible amount of control. It doesn't come with a a lot of room with in the car but how many sports cars do, not many. I also must say that this car has the ability to be able to get great rims, body kits, and system. This car has to ability to be faster than many cars with a great look and sound. I would recommend this car to everyone.<br><br>
