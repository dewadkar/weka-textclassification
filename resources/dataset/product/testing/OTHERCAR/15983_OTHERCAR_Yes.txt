            I had no intention of buying an S2000, I thought and still think they're very bland looking cars.  I wanted an Audi TT roadster but after reading about it's many problems (mostly electrical, (see Consumer Reports and Myaudittsucks.com) and not being enthralled after the test drive, I thought better.  I then looked at the Miata (again) and the MR2 and I found them no nicer than my '90 Honda CRX Si.  I decided to purchase 2001 Prelude as the dealers in my area was offering bargains on the remaining models.  When I walked into the dealer's showroom, smack dab in the middle was my S2000 w/ the red interior.  I test drove the car hoping not to like it and...

I do think the S2000 is a good value.  It still depreciates slower than other like cars (i.e. Boxter, Z3/Z4, et al).  It's largely hand built, it's low production numbers and that it shares nothing substantial with any other Honda product informs me that build cost are more for the S2000 than ANY of it's nearest competitors.

I could easily live with the power of this car under 6000 rpm.  Over 6000 rpm is a blast, for sure but I only occasionally go there!  I average 26 mpg.  I often drive this car 30 miles (one-way) to work w/an average speed of 80  mph.  If your not above 6000 rpm the noise levels are very acceptable, not quiet, but acceptable.  I can't imagine the reason to drive 7000 rpm or above for long durations, except on a race track. The ride is not smooth, but I think it's better than the Miata, MR2 and TT Roadster (all have much more body flex).

I've owned my S2000 since January, 2002 and have a little over 17000 miles, this is what informs my opinion. I also own a '90 Honda CRX Si, and previously owned a '78 Honda Civic I think Honda has earned it's reputation for building reliable vehicles.  I've also previously owned: Toyota Corolla & Tercel, Volkswagen Cabrio & Beetle, Datsun 210 and Nissan Maxima,  I like my Honda's best.
