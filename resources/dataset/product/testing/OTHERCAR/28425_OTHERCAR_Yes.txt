            We bought our Kia in July 1996, after having some initial problems with the brakes, they were &quot;mushy&quot; it has been a very reliable car.  I had test driven an Altima before buying the Sephia, the Altima had no power and violently shook when going over 80.  Yes, I admit it I am a &quot;speed demon&quot;, my husband and I have both &quot;pinned&quot; the speedometer.  I did it right after we got it, my hubby did it about 3 months ago, that should say something about the reliability and workmanship in this car.  We purchased the car in Phoenix, AZ  and less than a year later we moved to Warwick, RI, where they had never heard of Kia.  It was challenging to have repairs done on the car, everything had to be shipped from California, even the latch on the front seat console took 2 weeks to arrive, so we took a quick inventory of any and all repairs and took it in for service before the warranty ran out.  That was the last time we had anything fixed, other than regular service and the one recalled part this summer.  I put 25.000 miles on this car in the first 10 months with no problems, since then, we have been a little easier on her, she now has just under 60,000.  <br><br>
