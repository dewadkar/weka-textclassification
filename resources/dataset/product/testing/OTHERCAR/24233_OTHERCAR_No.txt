            I absolutely despise the car. We bought in on January 13, 2002 used. It has been nothing but problems.

First one was the same day we bought it. I hit the automatic locking switch and it didn't work. I thought maybe I didn't do it right so I got the manual out and looked and I did it right. The next day we took it to the mechanic and were told that the locking module went out.
This affected the automatic locks and the tailgate button. The replacement cost was $350. Not very good. Too bad we bought as is!

The next problem was when I mashed accelerator the engine started making this weird noise. I must be hearing things because I am the only one that hears it. We've even tried putting Premium fuel in it but that doesn't help. I've even written to Car and Driver about this and they said there was nothing wrong and just live with it.

The next problem was when we were coming back from the Biltmore in Asheville, North Carolina, I tried to recline the seat and the handle broke off. I couldn't believe it. You would think General Motors wouldn't use such cheap metal.

Some other problems are that there are numerous squeaks and rattles. I am a big person and take up the seat and I rub against the door. This causes a very ear shattering squeak that I can't stand. 

Also the 4-wheel drive transfer case has a mind of its own. Sometimes when you mash the button it doesn't do anything. The truck is designed so that when the 4-wheel drive goes out so does the whole drive line. Scary. But this SUV is a great offroader and drives great offroad but not on the road.

When I drive it on the road it has a very bumpy ride. First of all there is wind noise, then every time you hit a bump there is those annoying squeaks and rattles. 

Never take this SUV out on a road trip. The heats are highly uncomfortable. They are way too hard and the way the dash sticks out, it compromises knee room about 5 inches. The best you can last in this SUV is and hour.

The Jimmy has one of the worst engines I have ever seen. It is a 4.3 liter V6 with 190 horsepower and 250 ft-lbs. of torque. Compared to the new Trailblazer/Envoy this engine is dated.
