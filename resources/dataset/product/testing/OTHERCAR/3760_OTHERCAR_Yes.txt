            The good-I am a loyal Chevy owner. I do have to state that this pickup is all I was looking for. I have the extended cab version of the Z71 K1500 Silverado. Options include just about everything. When driving this truck, it has all the power you would expect (Opted for the 5.3L V-8 vortec engine). It also has all the convenience of a luxury car. When I purchased this truck in July, it was very early in the 2000 model year. If presented with the choice now, I would have gone with the fourth door. The interior has room for a party! Full sized back seat, with a bit of leg room to spare for an adult. I have been in the back of a friends F-150, and it doesn't compare at all! Fit and finish on this truck is nice. If you didn't see it getting in, you might forget you are in a truck by the quality and convenience of the interior options and fit. The paint seems to be of quality, and the indigo blue is beautiful.

The bad-I have had to visit the shop one time (outside of maint.). Chevy was aware of the possible problem with the early 2000's in the steering. I was asked about it when I took it in for service. The dealer worked on the steering, replaced a part, and sent me on my way with no bill.

All in all, I am very happy. I just traded in a 1998 S-10 with 32,000 miles, and prior to that I had an 1991 S-10 that I gave to my Father. He is still driving that truck with 215,000 miles. Hope to have the same with the Silverado!<br><br>
