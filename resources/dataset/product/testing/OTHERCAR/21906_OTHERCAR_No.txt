            I bought a 2000 BMW 540i in August of 1999.  This car is a pleasure to drive.  It is fast, it handles great, and looks wonderful.  In fact, it would be terrific, except it can't stand up to normal wear and tear.  The biggest drawback are the alloy wheels, which are like putty they bend so easily.  I had to replace one ($600!) after hitting a small pothole.  This apparently is quite common for BMW's, so much so that the dealer referred me to a repair shop that specializes in unbending the wheels.  Add to this electronics that freeze randomly, cupholder assemblies that break off easily, and a rear armrest that likes to pop out of it's &quot;holes&quot;.  If you live in a state with no road hazards and are fastidiously gentle with your vehicles, this car is for you.  True drivers will find their endurance far superior to their BMW 540.<br><br>
