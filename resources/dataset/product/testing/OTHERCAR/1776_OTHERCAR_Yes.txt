            When my wife and I moved to Phoenix, we decided we needed to have a convertible to fully appreciate the nice weather.  We looked at several different kinds and finally decided on the Sebring because it allows four adults to ride comfortably.  This was a must as I am 6&#1464&#148 and most my friends are taller than me.  

We bought the Sebring over a year ago now, and overall, we really like it.  For starters, the exterior is very nicely styled.  It looks very sexy and stylish and the finish quality is high.  The convertible top is nice and works well, however, it is a cloth top and this can cause some problems.  On several different occasions, someone at a car wash used a brush to try and get out a stain on the top, and tore the cloth top.  To get stains out, use a stain stick for clothing.  Trust me this works well.

The interior is very nicely laid out.  It is comfortable for road trips and everything works well.  Except the cup holders.  They are positioned low and in a place that makes it easy to spill your drink.  The leather is high quality and there is ample room for four adults.  In addition, the autostick option comes in handy when going down mountain hills and you want to keep it in a lower gear.  

The engine is not great, but has decent acceleration and good mileage at 20mpg in the city.  The handling is a bit mushy and the car could use some aftermarket suspension products, but I can&#146t find any.  The braking is adequate, but not great.  The rear brakes are drum, not disc, which makes it a little slow to break.  If you have to get the brake pads replaced, use OEM.  If you don&#146t, you will get brake fade and it is scary.  

Overall a good car, just needs more performance.
