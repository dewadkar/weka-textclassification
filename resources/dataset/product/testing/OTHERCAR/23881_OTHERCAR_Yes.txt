            Why don�t I love my Mazda Millenia? It has all the creature comforts, and the price was very fair ($18,000 in 96� with 20k miles), but still I can�t seem to get myself to like it. Maybe it is because I consider myself to be a driver.  I am someone who actually enjoys the act of driving.  I will go from point A to point C then to point B just so I can relax in the car for a while.  That said I want to compare the Mazda to cars like the Acura RL, Lexus GS300, or a BMW 528. Hmm no deal. 

Mazda vs. the world

The Mazda Millenia is actually a pretty good all around car.  I have a 95� which now has 70k miles on it.   In the last four years we have spent about $3500. To keep it in good running condition (that includes a new set of tires and regular oil changes).  We have the Bose Stereo w/6 disc CD changer and cassette, power everything, keyless entry and a leather interior that has held up better than any vehicle I have owned in 15 years (even with two small children).     

But compare this car to an Acura and somehow the car just doesn�t measure up.  It is a hard thing to explain, the Acura RL or TL is just more true to it�s spirit.  The Mazda drives like a big car.  While it does accelerate smoothly, it is by no means �peppy�.  The Acura on the other hand drives like a much smaller car.  Oh yea by the way the Acura comes with a 7 year 100k mile warrantee option, you just can�t beat that!

Compare the Mazda to a Lexus GS300 and well, the Mazda is just plain old boring.  The Mazda�s exterior is not much more than a rounded econo-box.  The GS300 is sporty and has lines than make it look almost menacing.  The same concept is true once you get into the car.  The Lexus and the Mazda are both roomy for drivers and passengers alike.  The engine in the Lexus roars with the heart of a lion both in sound and spunk.  Unlike the Mazda, the Lexus drives, corners, and feels like a sporty coupe not an economy minded sedan.

If you have ever driven a BMW than just go on to the next paragraph because you already know what I am about to say.  There is a reason Road and Track and Car and Driver pick the BMW over almost every other sedan their formula is this; (Fun Factor x Status + Luxury = BMW).  Comparing the Mazda to the 5 series BMW is like trying to compare margarine to butter.  You know the real thing when you taste it.  The BMW has much of the same features and functions as the Mazda (or vice versa), but driving a BMW is like driving a car whose soul was born on the track.  The BMW is an Olympic Track Star in a fur coat wearing dark sunglasses; it is the car to be seen with in all public places.  All of this shows in terms of price and resale value, this is one area where you get what you pay for.      

My biggest complaints about my Mazda:

    Thin paint.  I noticed after about four months of ownership that paint on the front bumper cover and hood were taking a beating from stones and road spray hitting the car.  Then I noticed that every door ding seems to chip or crack the paint.  OK, maybe it�s the Deep Sea Mica paint I have on (this is a special color).  I just think the paint could be better.  

    Mediocre power.  I did not spend the extra $2000. on the �S� model, but then again you don�t get much more bang for the buck when you do.  0�60 the Mazda accelerates smoothly but it is by no means quick.  Passing on the highway is OK, again it is smooth but not really responsive.    

   Boring styling.  Now this is highly subjective because there may be a few of you who think the Mazda is a beautiful work of art.  To you I say go write you own opinions (epinions)�I don�t get inspired, excited or even slightly moved by the body style or interior layout of the Millenia.  Yes. It is true it has lots of bells and whistles but can some please design them to be more attractive.   

If you are a Driver as opposed to a driver, that is to say you enjoy the act of getting from point A to point B the Mazda is not really a possibility for you.  On the other hand if you�re just looking for transportation with all the comforts of home, hey, a Mazda is not a bad deal for the money.  If you do decide to get one, find a slightly used model with less than 25k miles and DO NOT pay more than $20k.  Also you might want to consider white or pearl.  This car scratches easily and lighter colors don�t show the wear as well.
