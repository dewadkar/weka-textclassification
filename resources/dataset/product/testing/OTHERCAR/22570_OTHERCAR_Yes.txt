            Whoever said that it is the little things in life that make the difference, must of driven a Saab.  I am bit of a car junkie and this has got to be one of the best planned cars I have owned.  Of course I bought it initially because it is sporty and appeals to the linger yuppie in me.  As time wore on I began to love the details in this car that other manufacturers forget.  Here are a few examples: there is a switch that allows the driver to turn on just the rear seat light so one can check on the little ones, there is a light level detector that determines whether or not the radio and information display should dim or remain bright for daytime head light use, all trim screws are easily removed and replaced without standing on ones head (important for those of us inclined to add on gear), the control and power cable for a matching aftermarket cd changer is already there, real steal cargo teather hooks so your gear doesn't roll around, and last but not least the body is extra protected against rust.  I could also go on and on about the safety, but as that other car company's ad says, if they spent this much time on the little things, they must of taken care of the big ones.  Test drive a Saab, you may end up like the other 90% of us who did and drive a car you love.
