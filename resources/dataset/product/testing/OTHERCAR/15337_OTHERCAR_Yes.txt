            The Sony MCV-FD83 is an amazing camera! I always thought that digital cameras would just be the next fad and that the cost was not worth but I could not have been more wrong! 
The camera handles nicely although it does take some time to get use to holding it away from you and looking at the image box to take the picture but once you are use to it (doesn't take long) you can get some amazing shots! You can take color or solarized or black and white photography..the options on this baby just go on and on with zoom control and you can even take short &quot;movies&quot; on it!
I use to waste so much money on photographs that would come back from being developed and I would just be disapointed with the results..like closed eyes or someone wasn't ready but with the digital camera you can see the result immediately and get rid of it if you don't like it. 
It is also convenient to load your photos on your computer and print photo quality pictures..if you have a good printer.
Also don't be fooled by the design of the camera..I thought it would be really heavy but it weighs the same as regular camera.
If you take a lot of pictures then I think this camera is worth the investment and will probably pay for itself in a year or two from all the money you save on film and developing!
Have fun!<br><br>
