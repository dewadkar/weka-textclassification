            After using traditional 35mm and then APS cameras, this was my choice for my first foray into the realm of digital cameras. Having recently started my own business, my wife and I decided to purchase a digi-cam to take before/after pictures for our portfolio to market to prospective clients. We decided on digital as the better option for 1) overall cost, 2)speed of service, and 3) flexibility.

We selected the 3800 because it offered us the maximum combination of price, flexibility, aesthetics, and quality. At 3.2 megapixels, it allow photo-quality pictures of up to 8" x 10". This was important to us because our portfolio will be available both on-line and in hardcopy. It's been my experience that the 8 x 10 size to large enough to show fine details and allow easy viewing, but it's not too big or make for an unwieldy folio. We can also use this feature to save on those expensive sitting fees most photography places charge (it has a 10-sec. self-timer function also) so we can take all the pictures of our kids we want to send to family.

The flexibility comes from the different ways to print images; from the computer, from a photo-ready printer, or a photo kiosk. A minor issue is that the camera uses XD cards, which I have noticed are not as prevalent as SD, Smart Media, or Flash. However, it is very versatile media, so there is an offset.

One feature that I particularly enjoy is the OPTICAL zoom. Most cameras under $600 only have 3x optical, if that, and 2.5 or higher digital zoom. The 3800 has 6x optical and 3x digital, which was a major factor in our decision. For those who may not know, a higher optical zoom is better than a high digital zoom for one reason: digital zoom makes the pixels in the image larger; Optical adds more pixels (the effect is an optical zoom has more clarity than digital zoom). This feature allows those fine details to jump out of the image rather than obscure them.

I only have one major and one minor complaint about this camera. The major complaint is the manual. It's bulky and not as well laid out as I would like (but it is thorough!). The minor complaint is the shape isn't as ergonomically nice as some of the other cameras in it's class. If you are used to most APS cameras, this is going to take a little while to adjust. Pros will have no trouble adjusting, but if you've been spoiled by the "sleek" design that is today's standard, well, you'll get used to it after a while.

One recommendation is to get a card reader so you don't have to plug your camera up to the computer. It's not that it's difficult to do, but I've found that I'd rather leave my camera in it's bag than leaving it out in the open (those with kids will understand). Other than that, we are extremely happy with this choice and consider it almost a steal.
