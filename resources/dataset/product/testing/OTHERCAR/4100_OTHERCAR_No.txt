                 We have a 1998 Olds Intrigue - I was very pleased with it's performance and handling.  Until recently it was very reliable.  Now it has a hesitation upon take off that the dealers can't seem to fix.  It does have alot of leg room in the back seat even with the front seats fully back.  I am 5'9 and usually have difficulty with riding in the back.  

     It is a great family car - for those with a small family, although I am planning on expanding my family and will need to upgrade to a larger vehicle.  I have a 13 yo who is very big and 21 month old, so 2 car seats and the older one and you have a full car, no room for friends.

    The Intrigue handles very well in traffic and gets good gas mileage on the highway and in town.

     I would recommend looking at another vehicle if you want a dependable car.  <br><br>
