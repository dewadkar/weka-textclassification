            I bought my Cavalier on the advice of several friends who owned Cavalier's and loved them.  I bought my 1997 model slightly used in 1998.
It has been very reliable.  I have had no engine problems at all despite the fact that I put over 40,000 miles on the car in less than a year.  I have been very impressed with the gas mileage.  It is a smooth riding car, I forgot it only had 4 cylinders at times.  I had to have the front wheel bearings replaced at 48,000 miles.  I also had problems with the ABS system from the beginning, whenever it gets wet the brakes do lock at times.  The only other bad things are the trunk in my 4 door sedan is way too small and there is definitely not enough leg room in the back.  Overall it has been a good car and I would buy another one if it was a bit roomier.  I would not recommend this car for families with older children (longer legs) because you get feet pushed into your back a lot!  But for a family with car seats it would be an awesome ride.<br><br>
