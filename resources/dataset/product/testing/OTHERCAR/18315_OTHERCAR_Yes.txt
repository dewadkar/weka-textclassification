            I purchased my red 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse in April of 1995.  It was my dream car and when I learned that such a beautiful sports car was priced well under the $20,000.00 bracket, I decided that I couldn't live without one.  Later, I was glad that the car came with a 5-year, 100,000 mile warranty.  Within the first 2,500 miles, I noticed the check engine warning light was illuminated, so I promptly took it to the Mitsubishi dealership.  Among other things, the computer and stereo had to be replaced.  I also noticed paint chipping off my wipers and outside mirrors, so these were repainted at the manufacturer's expense.  By the time the car had 20,000 miles on it, I had had a total of 8 repairs.
But, like I said, I loved the way the car looked, and it drives smoothly with nice acceleration, not to mention the glances I get when the moonroof is opened over the top of the car!!
I've owned the car now for 5 years, and the warranty is expired.  After 65,000 miles, the &quot;bugs&quot; were apparently worked out of it and it is dependable.  I have a 100-mile daily commute to and from work and it has never left me stranded.  I recommend it to anyone who loves sports cars.<br><br>
