            I wanted a digital camera for its portability- my webcam just wasnt cutting it anymore.  So I bought this one for $218.00 at WalMart (in San Antonio, TX) knowing absolutely nothing about them.  After learning about the resolution and why that matters from another customer there, I decided on this one.  I brought it home and was taking pictures in about 15 minutes flat.  I am the kind of person who doesnt like to read the instruction manuals.  Thats my husbands job. Point being- without reading the manual, I figured it out rather quickly- its very user friendly.
The LCD screen is just wonderful! My camcorder has one, so I really wanted a digital camera that had one as well.  The only problems with the screen is that its very hard to see the screen in bright, direct sunlight as well as not so brightly lit areas.  I took it with me to some underground caverns and had to have the tour guide shine his flashlight at everything I wanted to take a picture of, even though there were lights along the way.  It did, however, even under dark circumstances, still take excellent pictures- and without any flash spots on the pictures that you sometimes get taking pictures in a dark area.
It sucks up the batteries though, thats for sure!  I definately recommend rechargeables.
The camera stores alot of pictures, allowing you to delete them as you go, if a picture doesnt come out good.  Plus it also has the card option, which is also great for taking it on vacation with you.
All in all, I would say this is a great camera all around.  You cant beat the price for it, and its wonderful for beginners.
There is no zoom on it unfortunately, but this is a great, inexpensive way to get started with a digital camera and not sacrifice quality pictures.
