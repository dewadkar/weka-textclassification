            My car that i was driving around died in April of 99. I went out a looked at a few different cars and chose to buy the Kia Sephia after test driving it. First off the price I got the base model sephia for $7005.00 Brand new! Now how many cars that are brand new sell for $7995.00 any more not to many!  Second off there are alot of safety features on the car with the side crush panels, dual air bags, 5 mile an hour bumpers.
The Kia is a very attractive car! I get compliments on it all the time. As a matter of fact 4 people I know have gone out and got them after I got mine! I also like the Kia Roadside assistance plan that they offer. If I should break down at all they will come and tow my car to the nearest Kia dealer and all that plus if we are in another state they will pay up to 300.00 for lodging and food! As a frequent traveler I found this to be a plus in my book!  I also like the dealer and how I am treated there!  Kia has been great to us! We have had two minor recalls nothing dangerous or anything and they were very corteous when I called them to ask exactly what is was for!  I love everything about my vehicle especially how it handles in the snow! It is really fun to drive this vehicle, I feel good driving it! There is nothing I hate about my KIA!
Any one who is looking for a Nice car at an economical price should by this car! It is less expensive then most cars and great on gas plus the seats are comfortable and the trunk space is pretty big! Those of you that are looking for a luxury car should not buy this car!!<br><br>
