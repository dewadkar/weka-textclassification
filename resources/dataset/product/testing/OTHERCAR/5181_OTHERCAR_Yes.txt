            This wasn't actually my car, it was my parents'.  However, I did spend a lot of time in it and I loved it.  I got a chance to drive it a few times and it was a dream.

We bought the 1998 Honda Accord EX Coupe in the V6 automatic transmission, February of 2001. Before we found this car, we had owned a 1999 GMC Sierra and we traded it in on the Accord.  I'm about 5'10" and 135 pounds, so it was a bit of a pain for me to sit in the truck and go places with two other people (my parents).

This car is luxury.  You can tap the gas pedal and the car responds with a pleasing sound and doesn't hesitate to pick up speed.  You can do 80mph easily in this car without realizing it.  The anti-lock brakes are especially powerful and stops you on a dime.  It handles very well, the steering is perfect -- if you ever needed to get somewhere in a hurry or needed to get away from someone or something, the Accord will be sure to satisfy you.  You'll even think you're in a Lexus from the way this car drives, turns, and sounds.  The engine is quiet as a mouse.

The interior is very roomy, at least in the front seat area.  Two small children could fit in the back seat without a problem. (However try going to Florida from Tennessee with another adult in the back with you, and you'll feel it when you get there.)  

The controls are extremely easy to learn and use.  The factory Honda stereo was surprisingly powerful to me when I first used it, for it to be factory installed with the original speakers. There was CD player standard, however, no tape deck. The more you turn it up, the more bass is provided and if it's loud enough, you'll be sure to probably annoy some other people near you with the bass if you're in a parking lot. ;)  I liked doing that.  I never felt the need to install any amps or subwoofers in this car, or try and persuade my parents to.

On the steering wheel are controls to enable you to turn the volume up and down or change the station. This is a plus for anyone who hates to fool with the radio while driving.  One bad thing about it, is that you can only toggle through the stations that are preset, and the radio has to be on for the controls to even do anything.  You can't turn the radio on from the steering wheel controls.

We bought this car in the spring and kept it into the summer, so we never got a chance to use the heat.  The automatic climate control was very useful, especially if you live in Georgia like us.  The temperature can go as low as 60 or go as high as 90.  It took about a minute or so to completely turn the interior of the car into an igloo at 68 on high.  I wouldn't use the air on high at 60 degrees unless you want hypothermia.

Other features in the '98 Accord Coupe EX were:
- Easy access power supply for a cell phone or laptop in the console underneath the radio.

- Built-in HomeLink System with three programmable buttons to open a garage door or turn on/off lights inside your home when closeby.  No more remote controls.

- Automatic tented sunroof that slides open and flips up

- Map lights and rear view mirror map lights

- Dual front airbags

- Anti-theft alarm, keyless entry, remote trunk release

- Power locks, windows, and driver's seat

- Lumbar support in seats

Unfortunately in July of 2001 we had to sell the car for financial reasons.  We had absolutely NO problems with this car whatsoever.  It was always more than reliable.  I still love the Accord Coupes and I still want one... but they are a bit pricey, so it may take a while to get it.  It's worth the wait, though.

If you can afford it, buy it.  You'll never regret it.  The style of this car begins in '98 & stays throughout '02, so I'd imagine the ones newer would be even better, if even possible.
