            I own a 92 Jeep Wrangler and my fiance owns a 80 Cj-7.  Soft-top jeeps are fine if you don't have to drive very far.  Otherwise, they are extremely loud on the road.  You can't talk to your passenger and without extra stereo equipment you can't hear the tunes.  The newer ones aren't that much better but they cost a lot more.  If you want a vehicle to go fourwheeling in then I would suggest an older wrangler or cj.  Why spend 20 grand or more and then have to get it equipped for fourwheeling.  Get a cheaper wrangler and make many modifications.<br><br>
