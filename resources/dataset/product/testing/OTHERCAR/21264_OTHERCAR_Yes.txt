            Sometimes, the numbers do lie.  This, the best-selling car in America (about 450,000 units sold), is not an exciting car, not a performing car, and not an overly inexpensive car.  However, the Camry offers good legroom in the front and back, although taller passengers may brush the roof.  Likewise, the trunk is well proportioned and somewhat large for the car itself.  Of course, one buys Toyota reliability when one buys a Camry (perhaps overstated reliability, but good nonetheless).

Surprisingly enough, weak points abound in the best-selling car in the nation, the worst being the tiny 2.2 liter four-banger under the hood, putting out a measly 136 horsepower/ 150 lbs. ft. of torque.  This adds up to a 0-60 run of 10 and a half seconds.  Forget about passing anyone on the freeway.  As always, I am a fan of any uplevel engine, and the Camry is no exception.  The alternate engine is a 3.0 liter V6, putting out a respectable 194 hp / 205 lbs. ft. of torque, and changing the acceleration to 8 and a half seconds to 60.  I think that an engine like this, while not nearly spectacular, certainly makes the car more exciting to drive, and I do believe the upgrade is worth it.

Roadholding in the Camry was tested at 0.78g on the skidpad, not a terrible figure, but not very good either.  When driving a Camry, one can sense that the steering is overassisted, and loses a feel for the road.  Characteristic of Toyotas, body roll is apparent, and cornering is dismal.

The interior of the Camry was designed around plastic.  It has a very plasticky feel, and simply seems cheap.  On the other hand, the control layout is very well done, with the stereo above the HVAC controls and very accessible.  My biggest aesthetic gripe was that the plastic trim often did not match at all.  Annoying yes, life-threatening no.  The radio in the Camry is weak, and not for the audiophiles among us.  Again, it is an annoyance, but not a huge priority.

Overall, this is a car that strives for mediocrity and is an amazing success.  If you want something to get you from point A to point B, this will do the trick.  There are other alternatives, but none so stealthy as this.  After all, no one looks at a Camry.  Boxes on wheels are not exciting.
