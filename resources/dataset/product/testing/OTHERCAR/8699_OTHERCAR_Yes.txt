                 I just purchased a 2001 Accord EX V-6 about a month ago and I love it. The new face-lifted version looks great and gives the car a much sportier look.  The steering wheel audio controls are very convenent and free your hands when you are driving.  Honda still needs to make a V-6 5 Speed though.
     I managed to save up for 2 1/2 years to finally buy this car.  I loved this car ever since I saw the first 1998 models when they first came out.  The seats are comfortable on this car and will not cramp you up on long drives.  The climinate control system is powerful and the cargo area is huge.  This car has great speed on the highway.  I managed to pass up a IS 300 on 280 and before I realized it, I was going 110 MPH!  The ride was so smooth that I didn't even feel that I was going that fast nor feel it as well.  The added dual exhaust is great, especially for those who are looking to upgrade thier exhaust systems.  For 2001, Honda did away with the wood tirm and went with a sportier carbon trim, a pro or con either way you think.  The added side airbags increase safety as well as gives you a better deal on insurance whichs leads to one of the Accord hidden strong points.  They are cheap to insure!  I had researched for months about this car and it's competitors and I'll give you a quick comparison:

Vs. Camaro and Mustang: These cars having way better proformance, but the insurance rates are unrealistic and even out the price of the car.  Their resale value is poor.
Vs. Alero:  The Accord is much better looking, faster, more powerful, and more reliable.
Vs. Monte Claro:  There isn't much of a price difference when you match all the standard equipment on the Accord EX V-6 to a Monte Claro SS.  Accord is better looking and more reliable as well as retains it's resale value better
Vs. Solara: The Solara is more expensive when you match the equipment up.  The Solara has a 5 speed availible, but the Accord's EX V-6 Auto tranny goes 7.4 0-60 while the Auto Toyota SLE goes 8.0 0-60.  The Accord also gives you a 6 in dash CD changer as well.

    This car is perfect for those who would like to get a Acura CL, but don't want to fork over the extra $5000-6000 or pay the Luxury tax on it.



 

Note:  For those of you thinking of buying this car, please research your car and deal ONLY with a fleet or sales manager.  Honda dealerships are known for being complete jerks.  Also, try to get a financed through a credit union or online as the rates are much lower than the dealership.  By doing this, you will be able to buy your car at a great price (Just look at my purchase price) and not even haggle for the price.  If you want to know how I purchased my car.  You can E-mail me and ask how I went about doing it.(It's a long story)

By the way, I think we need a dealership category so we can post epinions about good and bad dealership experiences.<br><br>
