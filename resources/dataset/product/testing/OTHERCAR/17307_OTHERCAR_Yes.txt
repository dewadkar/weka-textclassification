             I was on the prowl for a cheap second hand car to replace the junker that had just died weeks before.  While perusing through endless car dealerships, I stumbled upon the Malibu.  Immediately I thought, this car is going to be WAY to expensive for my $15,000 budget....  I was tickled pink to see the sticker on it say $14,900! So I got in and took it for a drive.  As soon as I started to drive it, I took notice of some premium features: the most comfortable seats, the excellent stereo system, the v-6 power, and the roominess inside.  I was taken, and bought it that day and have not regretted it.
  Some of the features that stick out to be the most prominent high-quality are:
1. Stereo System-I was blown away by the excellent sound of the stereo.  My car came with both cassette player and cd player.  The system has multiple options to choose from to find a station or the local weather.  The bass on this system is excellent! I expected to find subwoofers sitting in my trunk, but all that wondrous sound was coming from the factory 6x9's!
2.  Seats-My car came with heavenly seats... They are the premium clothe (a step below leather).  On long trips they are a god send!  My car is also equipped with six way power adjustable seats, which makes for easy moving when on the road.  
3.  POWER-Of course the very first thing that I noticed was the power! I noticed the badge on the back that said v-6 and thought it weird for a smaller car.  But, when I stepped on that gas pedal it delivered power that I had not seen in my other car (Chevy cavalier).  It is a very impressive 3.1 liter engine, that surprisingly does not eat gas like most do.
4.  Roominess-Coming from a Cavalier anything would seem roomy, but the Malibu seemed even more roomy than the other cars I had tested (that were the same size).   It has a generous amount of head and passenger space.
  After purchasing the car, I had some minor problems.  Some of the features on the car are a bit flimsy.  Such as the vanity mirror that when opened, ripped off and fell into my lap....  The more drastic setback was the chipping paint on the bumper.  But, even though these were a damper on my almost flawless new car, the warranty covered them and I have had zero problems since.
