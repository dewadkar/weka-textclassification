            We bought a 2000 CR-V Special Edition this past summer after much shopping around. Not that we doubted the quality of Honda (we've owned several)it's just we wanted to check out the competition. We bought the white with grey leather interior and had a roof rack installed. It's been a great little SUV, no mechanical problems, and we love the dual media that comes standard. We have 3 kids that fit comfortably in the back, and they love that the back seat reclines in case they're sleepy and want to lay back a bit. In fact, a friend of ours has a very nice Jeep Grand Cherokee, but the ride from the back seat in our CR-V vs. their Cherokee is much better, not as claustrophobic as theirs. But their front seats are much more comfortable, so I'll give them props for that! ;) I like that it's a gas miser, however I think I would enjoy a V6 more in the CR-V especially for highway lane-changing. So overall, I would recommend the CR-V definitely to anyone wanting the most for their car-buying dollar. It's affordable, comfortable, roomy, has gadgets galore, great stereo system (unless you're a MAJOR stereo buff), dependable, and you know you're getting Honda quality without compromise. Oh, and one more thing: spend the extra dough to get the Special Edition. The hard tire cover, painted bumpers, leather int., dual media, etc. etc. are so worth it!
