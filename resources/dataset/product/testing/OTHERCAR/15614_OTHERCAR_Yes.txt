            The Digital Age is here.  The Sony Mavica FD91 is wonderful unless you want to take it (lug it) with you on long vacation.

The camera itself does a great job.  The convenience of the diskettes can't be stated enough.  It definitely beats having to load the files down via a chip and serial port connection.

The cost of the media is insignificant.  The use of disks verses traditional film will allow the camera to eventually pay for itself.  

The Zoom was great.  I passed a rather colorful individual in London and was able to go to a &quot;safe&quot; distance and take a memorable picture of a pink haired, multi-pierced, individual that I consider a classic.

The ability to generate MPEGS with FD91 is great, although you can only record 60 seconds on one diskette.

The FD91 is best used without the flash.  Get enough light on the subject if possible.  The flash adds a strange color and it seems as if it almost late at lighting the subject.  

The flash quality (although low light pictures are quite good)and the size are the only negatives I have found with this camera. 

Overall, Sony has again paid attention to the quality.<br><br>
