            I purchased the e-photo smile camera in Oct of 1999, since I got this camera, I have not been pleased with the quality of the pictures it takes. I guess because of the low pixel quality, 640X800 the clearness of the pictures when viewed on my computer is real poor. Even after I go into the program and try to adjust the sharpness, color, saturation and brightness I come out at best with a fuzzy, picture that is very hard to make out. Maybe for the price it costs, I paid $129, its a good deal. But I e-mailed the Agfa company less that 30 days after I received my camera and asked if I could return this camera, get a more expensive model and pay the difference in the prices. Well I have yet to get a reply from Agfa one way or the other. So I plan to stay away from the Agfa e-photo brand of digital cameras. <br><br>
