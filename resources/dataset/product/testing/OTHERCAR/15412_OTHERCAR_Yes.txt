            The Sony Mavica Digital camera is one of the best digitals I have ever used.  It has very easy to follow directions.  The directions very thorough and easy to read.  There's nothing complicated about its use.  The camera takes outstanding, quality pictures with a floppy diskette.  What I truly enjoy about using the camera is the immediate results after taking the picture.  If it doesn't turn out the way you thought, just take another one.  It has immediate satisfaction because there's no waiting to be developed.  Other special features the camera has are audio with still pictures or audio with a 60 second video.  Those great features can't be found any place else and it's just so easy to use, plus the price it right too.
