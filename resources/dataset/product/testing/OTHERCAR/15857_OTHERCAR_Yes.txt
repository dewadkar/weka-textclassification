            I have 1993 Eagle Vision TSi. There were two model lines of the Vision the ESi and TSi. The TSi is the higher of the two. You could real close buying the ESi model by adding everything you could find, but still not get a TSi. It also was not a financially sound way to go. I bought it new, with all of 11 miles on it. 

The vehicle is fully outfitted; leather seating, premium stereo, power everything. The only thing I wanted and couldn't get was a sunroof, but that was not possible considering how the ceiling console is designed. Save that for the next car &lt;G&gt;!

The Vision had two sister cars, the Dodge Intrepid and the Chrysler Concorde. Those two still exist today; the Eagle line no longer is manufactured. The Dodge was the sport version, the Eagle was the Euro-sport version and the Chrysler was the luxury version. I say luxury, but that really isn't fair because you could get an Eagle outfitted like a Chrysler. The Chrysler just had more faux wood trim.

My vehicle has over 116,000 miles on it. I still love the car. It handles great, is respectable on gas mileage (19 around town and 32 on the highway!) and that with the larger 3.5L engine. It's downside is that it required 89 octane (plus) gas. The suspension is still in good shape; the shocks are still the same shocks, with no leaks or bouncing.

Other than the standard consumables on the car (tires, brakes, etc), repairs have been light. There is an air conditioner leak somewhere. Haven't found it yet. A recharge holds me for the season. The only other thing I lost was a radiator. Over the seven plus years I have owned the car, I certainly can't complain.

The car is very comfortable even on long trips. We have taken the 1200 mile ride to Florida with it, and have been very comfortable. That was for three people and their luggage. The trunk is quite large and holds more luggage than I expected. There is netting provided to assist in keeping the groceries standing. Quite helpful.

If I could do it over, would I? A most definite YES. I love the way the car holds the road, and feels when driving.<br><br>
