            This great camera has two important characteristics: simplicity and quality.

I bought this camera for my fiance, who is not a techno-whiz, and he had it whirring and whizzing and was snapping off great pics within an hour of opening the box.

The pictures are spectacular, even when printed and blown up to 8x10 size. And the software that comes with it, Picture Easy, is fun and easy to use. 

I had read a review prior to purchasing the camera that they were unable to download pictures from the camera to their pc through a USB hub, but that's the way we do it and have had no problems at all. 

This is a very professional camera and even looks much more like a 'real' camera than most of the other digitals. (I've always kind of thought they looked like toys.) 

It has all the features you should be looking for in a quality digital camera: 

Resolution: 1536 x 1024

Color LCD screen that can be turned off to save battery life.

Optical zoom to 3x, plus additional 2x digital zoom

Burst and time-lapse capabilities

Audio (So you can remember who's who from the family reunion, &quot;That's Aunt Betha standing next to Granddad.&quot;!)

Can be used with an external flash

While it is not exactly a &quot;bargain&quot; price, in this field you get what you pay for, and you get the higher quality you're paying for with this camera.
