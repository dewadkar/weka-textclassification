            Great car!!!!!
The Nissan Maxima is a true gem.
Reasons are that the pick-up is tremendous,comfortable interior,braking is very good,and the appearance is smart.
I am currently in my second Maxima,and even if I won $100,000,000 in the lottery,I would NOT get rid of my Maxima!!!! I would get a &quot;play car&quot;,like a Lotus,but I would still drive my Maxima in my every day travels! Lotus would only be used to impress the guys at the &quot;club&quot;.
Numerous times I have had a &quot;muscle&quot; car pull up next to me and I would just smile as I eased down on the gas and watched the muscle car get smaller in my rear view mirror.
Cornering,cruise control,mirrors,trunk space,interior,contol visability are superior and there are no blind spots.
To sum up the Nissan Maxima in 5 words:  Great car for the value and I would recommend this car to EVERYONE! 
Sorry,I could not fit my feelings into 5 words.
