            The Grand Cherokee looks good, rides good, and is a pleasure to drive. I have loved almost everything about mine. One disadvantage is the back glass does not open, instead you have to raise the entire hatch. Mine is a V8 that drinks gas and is full-time 4WD. This adds to the gas usage. Generally it gets about 18 mpg with city and highway driving. I have had mine 1yr and have driven about 30K. So far I have made three major repairs totaling over $2,000. This vehicle withstands a lot before it breaks, but when it breaks it costs much more to fix it than what a comprable vehicle would for the same repair.
