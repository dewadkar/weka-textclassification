            Although there are many other fine looking, more practical sport cars out there, I would suggest that you go and test drive a Dodge Viper.  Be sure to drive with someone who is very special to you.  Amazing handling, great sports suspension, and the styling makes the car look fast even when standing still.  

I had a wonderful opportunity to test drive a Dodge Viper.  This car is definitely becoming an American icon (or German-American since Daimler bought out Chrysler).  Ask anyone to name a great American sports car and they will most likely say &quot;Corvette.&quot;  But, ask someone young and who likes to stand out and they will say &quot;Dodge Viper.&quot;

Why?  The Dodge Viper came to market in the early 90s.  The car is not massed produced and many of the people who can afford a high priced sports car that doesn't want to show off will choose a Corvette, Jaguar, or BMW.  The Viper is a car that is noticed.  People turn their heads and stare.  

The best part of the vehicle is that it is different.  Not your typical sports car.  The handles are on the inside of the car.  The interior is compact.  Absolutely no room for luggage.  Other sports cars mentioned above can at least fit a duffle bag in the car.  The Viper's passenger seat is your storage room.  

The worst part of the vehicle is that it is not offered in automatic (or at least to my knowledge).  And the handling in winter weather should not be attempted.  And of course the one factor that usually gets the consumer to buy a more conservative sports car is the insurance.  It is outrageous for the Viper.  

The best quality of the vehicle is that it keeps its value well.  You will have no trouble selling the automobile for a premium price.  And the power of the car is unbelievable. 

My recommendation:  Go and lease the vehicle for a summer or 1 or 2 years.  This will help you determine if you want the vehicle.  The cost will be low rather than buying it.  And if the excitement, the power, the looks, the attention are too much...then let your son or daughter drive it...they will love you forever.  But most special is driving with someone you can share great experiences with to talk about later!
