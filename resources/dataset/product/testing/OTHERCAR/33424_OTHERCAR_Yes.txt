            In 1992, I leased my first Jetta and loved every second of driving it. I had my eye on it for months before, weighing the options against other foreign cars. Eight years later, I traded my '92 in for a '99 New Jetta and fell in love with the car all over again.

VW's in general, the Jetta in particular, have two strong components that make the cars so desirable... 1) they are strong, substantial and safe cars, and 2) they look great in every color they come in.

I was single when I leased this new Jetta, and although I had safety considerations, I chose it over others because it looked great and I loved to drive it. Now that I am married and expecting a child, I'm doubly grateful I made this choice because this is a safe, well-made car and I feel good about my family being in it. As an example, several months ago, a deer sprinted out infront of the car one night and, unable to avoid it, we hit the poor thing. Needless to say, the deer died and it was a mess on the road.  The force of the impact had done damage to the car, yet no one in the car was harmed and the car was completely driveable (as far as getting home).

The repair estimate was no where near as high as it might have been on another car, due to the integrity of the structure of the Jetta.

I highly recommend this car to anyone! <br><br>
