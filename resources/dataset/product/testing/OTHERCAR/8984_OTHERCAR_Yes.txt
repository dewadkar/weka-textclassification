            My wife and I started out to buy a sub-compact that she and our daughter with her newly minted driver's license could share.  Our minds soon changed  however when we visited the Hyundai dealership to look at the  Elantra, their entry into the sub-compact field.  We had looked at the new 2001 Honda Civic and the Nissan Sentra and wanted to seen how the 2000 Elantra compared. (The revamped 2001 model had not yet arrived.) Frankly we were not impressed except by its low price--but the new model may well be a different story. 
	As we were leaving the dealership my wife spotted the Sonata and despite my protests that it would be too expensive, she strode over, got in and fell in love!  When the dealer said that it would cost only a couple of thousand dollars more than the Elantra I became interested: that would mean it would be about the same price as a fully loaded Civic.  When the dealer told us that it came with standard side impact airbags I really got serious--having survived the learner-permit stage with my daughter I knew she would need all the protection she could get!  We drove it, we bought it and here are my first impressions:

	EXTERIOR--While obviously an area where personal opinion reigns supreme, I think the exterior of the Sonata is the best of the entry level family sedans.  My wife and daughter think the grill is cute, and it does look a little like those cartoon cars on the Chevron ads.  The side of the car avoids the econo-box slab effect with graceful curves and well done wheel-wells.   The rear-end  is particularly  graceful with taillights that integrate extremely well with the rear and side panels.  The car we selected had a rear spoiler that I think is totally unnecessary--both  stylistically and functionally--unless you plan on going over 90 MPH.  My daughter however loves it--for the style and  not the speed,  I hope...

	INTERIOR--Our car is the GLS model (this is the higher of the two trim levels offered) and its upgraded fabric is both elegant and quite durable in appearance. Leather is optional but not necessary--unless you are into that sort of thing.  The fit and finish are better than any of the sub-compacts we looked at and compares favorably to cars costing twice as much.  This model has fake wood trim on the dash which I think is fairly well done and dresses up an otherwise conventional dashboard.  My daughter hates the trim but I keep pointing to the spoiler and that seems to mollify her a little. Legroom in the car is much superior to the subcompacts particularly in the backseat.  (I felt I was returning to the womb when riding in the back of the Sentra.)  I was also impressed by the headroom in the car despite the optional moonroof.  On the supcompacts equipped with a moonroof my head was almost hitting the the ceiling .  

	PERFORMANCE--We had originally driven the base model with a four cylinder engine.  While peppy enough, it was fairly noisy during acceleration.  The GLS has a six-cylinder which only gives you slightly quicker pick-up but is much quieter.  There is still some engine noise getting up to speed, but it seems to come more from the exhaust than the engine and sort of reminds me of my first car (but that is another story...)  Once the car is at cruising speed it is one of the quietest cars I have driven.  There is virtually no wind  or engine noise.  You do hear a bit of road noise from the tires.  I was impressed by the fact that the car comes with Michelin tires rather than some cheapies that normally come with new cars and seem to last 20,000 miles at best.  The ride of the car is a nice compromise between crisp handling and a bigger car feel, due in part to the Double Wishbone front end and independent rear suspension.  A major complaint I have with the car is that you have to buy the GLS model to get 4-wheel disc brakes and then pay an additional amount to get ABS.  The brakes do seem quite responsive.  I have not crash tested the car but will report on the results when my daughter does. 

	VALUE--I think people used to buy a Hyundai for the price.  Now, at least with this car, the company is offering a true value.  While my &quot;fancy&quot; Sonata did cost  a little more than a subcompact the difference--about $1200 dollars more than a comparably equipped Civic, I feel I am getting a lot more for my money.  The base Sonata is an extremely good buy , placed squarely in the Japanese sub-compact price range. I no doubt will lose some in resale but if this model is any indication of the new cars Hyundai is putting out then there reputation will grow. The generous warranty will certainly help and did assuage my doubts. I strongly recommend this car for anyone looking at subcompact because of price or for those just  looking at entry-level family cars.  Not only will these folks save money but they will be getting one of the best cars in that field.
