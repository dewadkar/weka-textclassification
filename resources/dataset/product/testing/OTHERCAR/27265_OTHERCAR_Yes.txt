            The 2000 Firebird Formula is a well defined sports car that is very afordable for a sports car of its calabure.  Most of the interior has remained the same sense the release of the fourth body style in 1993.  The ride is very enjoyable for a daily driver and is a fun cruser for the weekends.  The power driver side seat is every comfortable in leather and keeps you nice and tight in your seat when you need  to make a quick move on the road.  The performance of this car is simply amazing!!  I have not driven anything like the Pontiac Firebird Formula in my life.  For $25,000.00 you can get a Formula well equiped with a CD Player and power seats and T-Tops.  The only bad thing about the Firebird is it does not like to play in the snow or rain.  On starts it likes to spin its tires in wet weather.  That is one thing i can live with though.
