            I got a promotion halfway across the country (on the other side of the rockies), and figured old faithful wouldn't make it. So I went looking for a truck to put all my stuff in. I went to a friend who happens to be a salesman and we went to see some new Dodge trucks. As we walked through the lot we passed a row of Daewoos and I was instantly taken by the Nubira Wagon. It's very stylish. My initial feelings upon driving were of comfort, not so much of the seats, but of how the car felt while driving. I have driven Accords for 6-7 years and the ride and handling was very similar. What I got for the price sealed the deal, for what I would've paid for a truck with no amenities, I got it all. Good mileage and a great stereo are both important. 

There's some details that could be refined in future models, road noise could be lessened a great deal. The Wheel/Tire combination is the least attractive exterior feature. Comfort items such as the sun visors and cupholders are subpar(the unremovable &quot;death-by-airbag&quot; warning on the visors is pretty ugly), and the weak attempt at a central armrest is pretty lame. But, I spent 4 days and 2000 miles in good comfort, so there are no problems with the over-all. The capacity of the wagon is outstanding, I packed the thing full and strapped a good 300 lbs. to the top and could still cruise easily at 80, getting up to 90 when necessary! I could never see myself in a station wagon, a 20-something single guy, but hang fashion, this is a great car (let's hope it holds it's trade value)! Love it.<br><br>
