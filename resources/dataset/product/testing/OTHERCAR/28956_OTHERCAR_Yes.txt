            I bought this car used and had few problems. The normal stuff like changing the spark plugs and wires. The major problem was the Alternator. I was driving home from supper one day and the voltage light came on. The way Chevy design the motor was to put the Alt. in the back of the engine where all the heat goes and blows the alt. If this happens to you I would strongly recommend buying an alt. with lifetime guarantee. Other then that this cars runs perfect. I went on a trip to Canada and had no problems and the gas was great avg. 35-40 mpg highway and 20-25 city. The seats are very comfortably. I have the standard Lumina with the 3.1 V6 Auto with power everything and I strongly recommend this to anyone. Oh also I pulled at least 2,000 pounds with this car with no problems. I have 129,000 miles and it runs like they'res only 20,000 and the engine is CLEAN! No leaks what so ever.
