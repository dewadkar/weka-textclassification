            This is the perfect car for anyone who wants good value for not a lot of money.  Just graduating college, I did not have much of a budget to spend on a new car, but didn't want the risk of buying used.  I ended up buying a Dodge Neon and was more satisfied with this car than with any other car that I had driven before.  The price was very affordable for me, considering I had to pay off student loans and pay for a new apartment.  It drives beautifully, has great steering and excellent control.  I think that the car is sporty looking and trendy.  One thing that I don't like about the car is that there is not a lot of trunk space.  But, Dodge was obviously noticing this themselves when they designed the car because the back seat flips down for convienence.  I highly recommend this car to anyone, but especially to those, who like me, want to spend their money wisely.<br><br>
