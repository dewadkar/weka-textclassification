            My friend needed a car.  His brother had a K-car 2.2 litre 4 cylinder and an old 1984 dodge caravan, so he did what he though would work he combined the two.  A van(mini or not) doesn't belong with a 4cyl. and it was stock from 1984 to 1988 when the six came out.  they even put a turbocharged 4 cylinder in the vans at one time.  

The van was one of the worst things we have ever driven.  It is slower than a Dump truck.  And as ugly as a bus.  The van broke down four times in its three week life time.  the vans are so heavy that the 4 cylinder burns as much gas as a small V-8.  they are just a small box with no power.  Me and my friend pulled up next to a 1992 GEO METRO and hit it.  The metro blew us away and we were maxed out all the way.  

The Crapavan was a wreck from the start.  the first to go was the drivers side bearing.  then the whole back hatch need replaced.  Then the transmission blew up completely and knocked the motor mont off.  Then when we gave it away to a local shop who planed on fixing it and selling it. The engine Blew up and leaked fluids everywhere and is now in the middle of a field with 3 flat tires.

So is there any good things about an 1984 crapavan.  Yes belive it or not.  First the caravan has enough room to install a small dodge V8 like the trusty 318.  second, there is a kit to turn a caravan into a van/truck called the EL Carameno kit.  third.  They are able to be burned to the ground.

The thing to learn for this is never trust FRANK CO. AUTOMOTIVE Inc (my frineds brother not a real company).  and Thank god for the Pontiac fiero and Mitsubishi 3.0L v-6 OHC......<br><br>
