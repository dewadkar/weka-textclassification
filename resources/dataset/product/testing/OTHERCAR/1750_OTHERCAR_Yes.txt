            I purchased my 1995 Mazda 626 LX because I wanted a little bit bigger car that still was on the sporty side.  This car looks great in hunter green with a spoiler that acts as an extra break light.  I have found this car to have a great ride, its very comfortable, and has plenty of room.  The trunk size is excellent and the rear seats can be laid down for more storage when needed (60/40 split). 

I also love this car because of its safety factors.  It has dual air bags and extra support in the doors.  This extra support in my driver's side door saved me from serious injury.  I was hit by a large pickup that was traveling at a fairly high speed after it had run a stop sign.  The truck hit my Mazda 626 right on my door and it also hit part of the back door (driver's side).  I was injured, but not seriously hurt.  My car took a terrible hit, but I was able to walk away from that crash on my feet; with no broken bones!  My car was fixed up like new again and I would not give it up for the world!  I truly feel safe in my Mazda 626.

The only thing I would say that I don't like about my car is the seats.  The cloth material is very soft, but it likes to pick up lint and hair.  It is kind of a pain to keep the seats clean.  

One cool option that you have is to make the air vents swing back and forth or stay in one position.  It is kind of a conversation piece and a little entertainment for kids.

I have only had to take it into the shop 1 time and it turned out that there was a recalled part/chip that just needed to be replaced.<br><br>
