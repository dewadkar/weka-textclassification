            After years of driving small cars (Plymouth Turismo, Plymouth Colt, Toyota Celica), I was tired of never being able to drive when a group of friends were going out together.  I wanted to find a larger car that could accommodate four adults, yet still had a sporty attitude.  After researching several used cars in this class, I settled on my Stratus and have never regretted it.

I bought my 1996 Stratus in February 1999 with 24,000 miles on it.  The car had several upgrades including power windows, mirrors and door locks, cruise control, and the upgraded upholstery.  I bought the extended warranty package which will cover me through 75,000 miles and take care of me in the event that I have the 50,000 to 55,0000 mile head gasket problem that several other reviewers have mentioned.

I have back and shoulder problems which can be very painful on long trips if the car seats don't provide sufficient support.  I have already made three long road trips in this car and it has been the most comfortable ride of any of my cars, including the Celica which had special lumbar support seats.

I love the way the car handles.  It is crisp and responsive.  I feel like I have the security of a larger car without the &quot;boat-like&quot; feeling I have experienced when driving several other larger cars.  It feels very solid and runs fairly quietly.

The roominess is delightful.  I have one friend who is 6'5&quot; and he also bought a Stratus because it is one of the few cars that can accommodate his height.  Whenever I have people riding in the backseat for the first time, they always express pleasant surprise at how much room they have.  The trunk is also very large.  The trunk has a different way of opening from most cars -- it does not elevate or hold itself up, but when you push it up, it opens fully (to a ninety degree angle) and stays.  This makes it very easy to load once you get used to it.  I did get hit in the head twice, once when I didn't open the lid fully and let it crash down on myself, another time when a bellman did the same thing.

I had a defective tensioner on the timing belt at about 30,000 miles requiring a tow.  This was covered by my extended warranty, after the $100 deductible.  I was disappointed that I had a problem so soon after getting the car, but I like the car so much it did not dampen my enthusiasm too much.  I have also had to have front brake work done at about 38,000 miles, but I hear that is typical.  Other than these two problems it has been completely dependable and a delight to drive.
