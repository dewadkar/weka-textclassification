            After doing extensive research, I purchased my first digital camera, the Canon PowerShot G2.  I wanted to be able to view my photos to make sure the shots were perfect, and print them as needed.  With digital cameras, you can print only the shots you want.  There's no more wasted film used on just so-so photos, and no wait to have your photos processed. I paid $735 for the G2 at a local camera store, which had better prices than the larger electronics stores.  Note that Canon recently lowered the price on this model, so do some comparison shopping before making your purchase.

This new camera is awesome, and is very easy to use.  While the battery is charging (which initially takes about three hours), take the time to read the owner's manual.  It is written in simple terms, and by the time the camera is ready, you will be ready to use many of the camera's great features.  As an amateur with room to grow, this camera is perfect.  I've been playing around with it, and have begun experimenting with white balance, color adjustments, etc.  That's one of the great things about this camera -- if you don't want to make adjustments, you don't have to.  But the G2 allows you the flexibility to adjust just about everything, and makes taking photographs fun.   If you don't like the picture, just delete it and try again!

Pros
Photo color and clarity
Adjustable flip-out LCD screen 
Easy to use menus and controls 
ZoomBrowser software 
32mb Compact Flash memory - enough for about 32 high resolution photos
Remote included

Cons
Weight -- not a big deal, but a bit larger than some other digital cameras
Hand grip should be rubberized for easier holding

Additional Accessories
Camera bag -- Forget about the cheap, non-padded Canon bag.  I bought a Nikon Coolpix bag for $30, which fits the camera perfectly and has ample padding and room for the memory and battery.
Compact Flash adapter cable -- Used to quickly import images from the memory card via your PC's USB port.  I bought a Microtech Compact Flash cable for $25.  Consider this option, as importing images directly from your camera will use up your battery faster.
Additional memory -- You also don't need to buy the Canon memory.  I purchased Microtech's 256mb memory for only $130.  
Spare battery -- I haven't yet purchased a spare battery, given the expected long battery life, but expect to pay about $60 when I finally get around to it.
