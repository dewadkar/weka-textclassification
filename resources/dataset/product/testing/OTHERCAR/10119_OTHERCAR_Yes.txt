            I bought this car when it was already two years old and couldn't have gotten a better buy.  I have had no problems with it at all...outside of general age and use, but nothing majorly wrong with it.  This is a midsized car, it has a roomy front seat, the back is a little bit cramped for large adults though and has a HUGE trunk.  This car drives very well, no bumps or pings, no loud noises from under the hood or anywhere else, it gets fairly decent mileage and is great on a long road trip which I frequently have to take on business.  The car is not cumbersome and is quite &quot;cute&quot; in appearance.  Anyone who has a limited budget should look into this car, it is inexpensive and very easy on the insurance. I do not plan to buy any other make of a car than a Mazda Protege as this has become my favorite car since I first saw it on the show room floor.  It looks nice, it runs like a charm and it is easy on the budget.<br><br>
