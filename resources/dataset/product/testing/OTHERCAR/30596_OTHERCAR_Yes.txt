            My husband and I bought one of the first Kia Sportages to come off the boat back in 1995. Being the first model, it had a few kinks that needed to be worked out (the horn didn't work when we bought it for example) but were all quickly taken care of under warranty. The car handles well in all conditions (we do take it off-road so can attest that it likes to be covered in mud as a 4X4 should be from time to time). It gets reasonable gas mileage, has had very few repairs and has been a wonderful investment. There is an abundance of room in the vehicle both in front, in back and when you are packing the whole vehicle with a week's worth of camping gear. The times when we have had it fixed, Kia has been very helpful in helping us find nearby dealers (we have moved a few times during the last few years) and each time calling us afterward to see how our repair experience went. When we locked our keys in the car one time, the Kia roadside service came right out to the parking lot we were stuck in and helped us out, for free. 

His parents liked our Kia so much that they bought one and are equally pleased with their car. When we are ready for another vehicle, we'll just trade this in for a new Kia...we've been that pleased.
