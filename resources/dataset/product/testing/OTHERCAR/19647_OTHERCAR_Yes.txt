             The Saturn SL1- where to begin? I think my husband and I knew from the beginning that when we bought our first new car, it would be a Saturn. My father in law works for Saturn and had owned one that my husband drove in high school, so we already had been introduced to the company and car. 

  We began our search in September of 1998, looking at the older models of Saturns. I was expecting our first child in March of 1999, and we knew we needed a four door car. After considering the fact that we could take advantage of the GM family discount of 15% off, we decided to go for the 1999 model, brand new at the time.

  I was very impressed with the extras the SL1 had standard issue on the car. For example- dual airbags, power steering, am/fm stereo, child security door locks and daytime running lights just to name a few. We opted for a package deal also. This gave us all the extras we wanted, packaged together for around 2000 dollars. This included features like power locks, air conditioning and a security system. In the end we also included features like a cd player on our car.

  We have had the car for two years now and I couldn't be happier. We have never had any problems with the car, although if we did chances are the warranty would cover it (2 years, 36,000 miles). The company has been great with oil changes and also installing extra items such as car seat tethers when needed.  I have used the car for many long trips, such as back and forth from Michigan to Virginia 5 times. The mileage is wonderful (27 city mpg and 37 highway mpg), and the comfort of riding in any seat is excellent. 

   I would recommend this car to any family. Having four doors is wonderful! It also has a large trunk, great for items such as double strollers. I am very happy with our purchase and the only reason I would ever trade it in would be if we decided on a mini van or SUV.
