            My 1999 Toyota TRD Prerunner Tacoma is the best investment I have ever made.  I have to admit, I was pressured into buying it by the salesman.  But after the test drive and just looking at the beauty I was sold.  The is only one thing that I don't like about it, that is that it doesn't have electric mirrors.  I guess I'm just lazy.  I have friends with all other types of trucks and they are all jealous of me.  When we go on road trips, we always take my truck.  It is the most comfortable truck I have ever been in.  The power is a definite plus.  I live in California, and everyone drives out here and they drive for power.  The power that I get from my Tacoma is better than that of most vehicles.  If you are looking for a good truck, look elsewhere.  But if you want a great all around truck, you've found it.  And I don't even need to tell you how cool it looks.<br><br>
