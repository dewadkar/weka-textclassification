            The 2000 Impala is my 3rd Impala. As a young guy I owned a '63 2 Dr. Hardtop(as we called them then) and a '66 Hardtop with the 396 &quot;Porcupine&quot; head V-8. That was a hummer. As fun as those cars were, they were no where as tech-sophisticated as this one. I own the LS version which in my opinion is the one to get. You get the the larger V-6, anti-lock brakes, tighter suspension and steering, a cool set of wheels and 16&quot; tires. The car will flat out honk, is dead quiet and really holds the road. I have to be careful not to really exceed the speed limit when driving on the highway. The fit and finish is great. The radio and disc player produce great sound. I get between 20-21 mpg driving to work and around town. Much different from those older Impalas where 12-15mpg was about it. The car looks great, in an understated way,(I have the Carmine Red). I also forsook the &quot;Spoiler&quot; which saved me $170.My only negative concerns the dash board vents which seem to have a limited range for directing air away from your face. If it gets too cold you have to close them. I paid $23600 with tax,tip and gratuities. The only thing I don't have is a moon roof and leather interior. I think its a great buy for the money(certainly less then everyone's favorite?????-the Camry). I would recommend this car to anyone who needs family size room, with still a bit of sportiness. I only have 9000 miles on the car with no service problems so far.<br><br>
