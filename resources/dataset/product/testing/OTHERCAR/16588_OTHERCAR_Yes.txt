                 This camera model seems to be pretty popular this year for the general digicam starter or continuing non-professional user. The price looks good from the onset, but you will quickly realize you'll have to shell out $150 more for the accessories needed. As far as Sony goes, I'd take this camera over the CDMavica any day. The mavica is almost $300 more expensive for a similar quality of photo, but its much bigger and heavier. It takes longer for the Mavica to write to CD than the Cyber-Shot takes to write to Memory Stick, and its really no trouble transferring pictures from this camera to the computer through the USB cord. Its probably faster than using the Mavica CD.  

Memory - The camera comes with a pitiful 4 megabyte memory stick. At the highest resolution, it will only hold 4 pictures! You'll have to buy the 32 or 64 megabyte memory stick to get proper use out of this camera. 

Battery Life - The AA batteries it comes with won't last long enough to figure out how to use the camera. The $100 infoLithium battery is a must (The battery pack comes with a carrying case for the camera.) Once you have the battery pack, the camera will last for hundreds of pictures.

Megapixels - This camera comes with 2.1 megapixels. In my opinion, this is plenty, unless you need to blow your pictures up to poster size. 

Features - The nighttime function really improves the photos you can take at night. The macro function also takes fabulous photos if you can hold the camera steady enough. The flash is good. The auto-focus/auto-aperture works like a charm. Comes with the ability to take pictures in the negative, sepia fashion, black and white, and solarized. A video-out cable is included so you can entertain your friends by putting photos or movies on their TV set. The only option I consider negative is the movie function which is almost worthless. It doesn't record with sound, and the quality/framerate is hideous. 

Zoom - This camera really zooms in better than you expect it to. It's a 3x optical zoom and a 6x digital zoom. Also, you can order telephoto lenses for this camera to improve the zoom. The whole lens casing only protrudes from the camera about 3/4 of an inch, which is good.
