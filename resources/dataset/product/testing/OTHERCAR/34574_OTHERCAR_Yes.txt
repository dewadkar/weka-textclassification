            I don't know why, but I love this car. The ride is terrible. The backseats are (shudder) torture devices, with little room for your feet, and the engine makes the switch from ox-cart to auto look foolish. Yet it is a great car.

This SUV is slow. Going up hills and trying to pass other cars are not easy tasks. This problem is magnified by a transmission that can't seem to select the right gear. Yet when it comes down to it, the 3.3L V6 can perform when it needs to. It has surprisingly good feel in low RPM. I am not sure the torque figure, but off-roading or 0-30 mph acceleration is comparable to other SUVs in the class with much more horsepower (Explorer to name one). And you get used to the tranny. I actually enjoy the raw shifts that clunk into place. And after driving this car for 60,000 miles, I know the power bands- I can push the right buttons to make this thing go.

The selectable 4wd system is great. There are 2wd, Auto and 4wd modes to select from. Auto is a 4wd setup determined by the computer. You select this mode in the rain, and when the car detects a tire slipping, it transfers torque to the other wheels to regain traction. I feel very secure driving in the rain. 4wd is used for the snow. It is very clumsy in the wet because the axels are locked, but in the mud or snow, it works fine.

The seats in this car are leather wrapped bed mattresses. The front seats provide no lateral support. They are completely flat. The backseats are bench seats which fold down for extra cargo space. Again they are flat as a board, and after about 30 minutes of sitting there your lower back either aches or falls asleep. FUN!

The stereo is one of the best features in the car. The Bose system provides great sound, including booming bass. I read of a man who wanted a subwoofer for his Q. If you hear this system, you'll understand why I think he is crazy. The radio is also aided by a wire that travels down the center of the windshield. It gives great reception, although I can tell no difference between the Q's radio reception and that of another car with no radio aide wire.

Airbags are standard. Drum brakes are in the rear which is ridiculous for such an expensive car, but surprisingly, the pedal feel is outstanding. Cargo space is limited, although two bikes or two bails of hay will fit in the back, to give you an idea of interior room. To put it this way, a family of four can fit their luggage easily back there for a week long getaway.

As I said, on paper this SUV seems horrible. It is slow. It is small compared to others. It has a solid rear axle for a clunky ride. The rear seat room is a joke. There is no rear seat room, simply an isle for groceries. But I love driving this machine. The build quality cannot be matched. The only trouble I've had is a loose selector knob. I have grown accustomed to the quirks and I have found the SUV to be very livable. You can drive it to work or to the ____ (insert your ideal weekend getaway here). All my complaining is tough love. In retrospect, perhaps I should have looked at the Merc, Bimmer, Toyota or other options more closely. For a decent used price this is certainly a car you should consider buying as a kid hauler or if you want an alternative to the bigger bunch (Suburban et al.).
