            I bought this specific car because of the price, quality, color, value for the money and the sales people seemed eager to help me, not to just have me &quot;buy&quot; a car. 

I love the fact that it is a nice size, inexpensive on gas and insurance, has 4 doors, cd player, automatic, air conditioning and cloth seats. I was also very happy that the Sephia had the new 'tethers' for the back seat car seats. 
I was only not happy that standard or not, you could not have ABS on the Sephia. 

This Kia is a joy to drive, I am not into &quot;speed&quot; racing, so a nice down to earth, family type auto.  I can speed up or slow down without the fear of &quot;can I make it&quot;.  
Freeway driving is a breeze. 
I easily have gotten up to 95 mph without knowing it on the freeways. I would suggest that anyone with a limited budget, elderly, single or families. 
Anyone with pets, needs trunk space without jeopordizing seat space, anyone with a need for a quality auto and smart people purchase this auto!

I am adding this little bit about the Kia though.  

When we had first gotten the car, we had an emergency trip (funeral) to go to in Michigan.  That is about 3000 miles, one way.  As we were driving through someplace in either New Mexico or Texas, all of a sudden WHACK!!!!  The rubber that surrounds the windshield came off and began WHACKING the winshield and the door.  Talk about scaring the sh*t out of you when you are already in a crisis situation.  Well, we did &quot;rig&quot; it so that when we got to Michigan, we were able to take it to a Kia dealer and they promptly fixed it for us.  

The other thing that still bugs me, to this day. August 9,2000 is that no matter what, when I push on the brakes, either lightly or hard, they have a ear popping SCREACH!  I immediately took it to the Kia dealership, they said that nothing was wrong, gave us new brake shoes/pads(whatever they are), callipers, and all.  It STILL squeeks to this day.  Mainly when I first drive it for the day.  After about 10-15 minutes of going someplace and pushing on the brakes a couple of times, it stops squeeling.  I just wonder if it is the humidity here, or what?  I still like the car, just hate the squeeling!  Thanks and good luck.<br><br>
