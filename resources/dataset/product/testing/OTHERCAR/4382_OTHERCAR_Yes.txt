            I love driving. So when I had a chance to buy this car from a relative to replace my 22-year-old Volvo, I jumped at the chance, not worried about not having a choice in the exact model or options. I knew it was well-maintained, and I have always (repeat: always) wanted a BMW. I absolutely love this car, quirks and all. I never thought I would have a car this nice until much later in life. And because my 318is is quite an improvement from my previous car, I don't have many reasons to complain, but in the the four months I have owned it, a number of odd interior problems have popped up--all of them livable, just annoying. If you really want to hear the details, read on. Otherwise, just know that I am perfectly happy with my car and I would recommend anyone buying this same year and model. It's fun to zip around in, and reliable too!

An inside rear panel decided to become mostly unglued, and also on the right side of the interior, the front passenger door panel has vinyl/leather-type material that is coming unglued. It's just raising itself from being glued down on the part where a passenger rests his or her arm. I can see this beginning in the corner of the driver's side armrest as well. Most people I show this too haven't seen that before, and I'm hesitant to get it fixed--it's probably expensive. The only thing I can think of is that the car was in enough of a certain type of weather condition to make that happen, but it's suspicious to me. Sure, a 7-year-old car is going to start to show its wear, but I expect more from a BMW.

Also, something in the driver's door rattles. I don't notice it too much because I always have the music pumped up loud (it does have a great stereo considering I still have the factory speakers). I can't for the life of me figure out what it is, but it does bother me. The driver's seat also squeaks a fair amount (I know I know, that isn't a big deal).

I know I can get most of this stuff fixed, but as a graduating college student, I need to save my money for other things (hopefully not mechanical repairs!), and I don't think that some of these interior problems should be cropping up anyway. But as I said before, it's a great car that I highly recommend and I intend to keep it for a long time.
