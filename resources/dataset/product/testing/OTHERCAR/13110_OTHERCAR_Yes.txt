            I bought this car because I come from a Honda family.  My mother has had two, my father one, and I one (used).  Pricing is fair, but be warned, the coupes are fairly hard to come by and dealers don't move to much.  I friend of mine who owns a dealership in Iowa told me that getting a dealer down 1,000 to 1,500 off sticker was about as good as you are going to get.

Like the other reviewers, I agree that the engine is superb.  The car accelerates smoothly and cruises quietly even at 100 mph.  The interior is well designed, the audio controls on the steering wheel are great.  The automatic climate control works very well.

Unfortunately, there are still a few design flaws.  It is very hard to get into the back seats from the driver's side because the power driver's seat doesn't slide forward.  The back seats are cramped for the taller among us and also lack an arm rest.

When the car is iced over, the water that melts of the rear window when the defroster is turned on runs right over the lid to the gas cover, and then freezes.  At least twice I had to pry the lid open with a key in the middle of a winter storm before I could refuel.

There are a few hassles with the audio system.  When listening to a CD, it would be nice to be able to jump through the first six tracks using the 6 buttons for audio pre-sets, but you can't.  The buttons, instead, do nothing.  The steering wheel audio control only lets you jump up through audio tracks, not up or down (which could have been done with a toggle.

One neat thing...  want to test the little chip inside your key?  Take a metal key ring, but the tip of the key through the ring (thread the needle) and then try and start your car.  Guess what?  The car won't start because the metal ring stops your key from talk with the with smart-start electronics.  This is wonderful theft deterence.
