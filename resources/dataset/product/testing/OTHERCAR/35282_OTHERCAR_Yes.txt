            January 23, 2000, we will end our 3 1/2 year relationship with our '96 Mitsubishi Galant.  We leased this vehicle after owning a '90 model that we regretted letting go of at the time.  New car fever had us in her clutches and would not let go.  The '96 S model had less frills than our '90 version and took awhile to get used to.  The manufacturer took away the chrome trim, door guards, and made a less impressive interior, too. (I understand this year's model has some of these things back again.)  However, we loved the dependability of both of these vehicles. We never worried about a breakdown on the highway.  Since our family has grown a little larger now, we will seek out a minivan for our next vehicle, but I will never forget these two Galants.  They will forever remind me that Mitsubishi makes a reliable car, and when our minivan days are over, we will definitely consider buying another Mitsubishi Galant. Good-bye Galant, for now.   <br><br>
