            I have the DC-210 Megapixel and it's a good basic digital camera.  It is very easy to use.  The controls are very straightforward and easy to access.  To take pictures, you just adjust the zoom, point and click.  You get a preview of the picture on the screen and you have about 10-15 seconds to delete it right away if you want to.

You can use the review functions to look at the pictures you have already taken and delete the ones you don't want.  You can also delete the entire set as well, which is handy after you transfer them over to the PC and want to clear the memory card.

The is also a choice of settings for picture quality, which also affects how many pictures you can store.  You can save about 4 times as many pictures on the lowest quality settings as the highest, and unless you have a very high-end printer, the quality is fine.

This model only has a serial connection, and it is pretty slow transferring pics to the PC.  There is a model that has a USB connection that is supposed to be much faster, and I would recommend looking into that.

My camera came with Adobe Photo Deluxe, which is a decent image editing program.  It's not Photoshop, but it is easy to use to transfer the pictures and do basic editing.

One thing that I don't like is there is a hesitation after you click the shutter and before it actually takes the picture.  It takes a little while to get used to it.

It also eats batteries like crazy.  Definitely get rechargables.  You can extend the battery life if you use the AC adapter when you review pictures and transfer them.  (I have a different expectation of battery life than they listed in the options - 100-200 exposures is poor in my book.)

Overall, it's a very good low-end camera if you just want to take pictures to post on a website or send to friends.
