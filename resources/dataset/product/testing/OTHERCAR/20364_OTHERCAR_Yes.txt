            We ordered a Mazda Tribute in January because we wanted specific options that they did not have on the lot. We were warned that a factory order was running at about 3 months.  Our lease was up in June so we had plenty of time. It ended up coming in at the end of May.  It was delayed because of ABS and rear seat supply issues.  But all in all it was well worth the wait.

This is the model and packages we bought:
LX-V6 4x4
Platinum Metallic
Gray cloth
ABS with side airbags
6 disc CD changer with 7 speakers
cargo trunk liner
cargo net 

MSRP would have been $23,509.  Tribute is in demand so you will have to pay close to sticker for it.  We got it a lot cheaper because my husband works for a dealership and gets an employee deal. 

A LX-V6 comes with:
200 hp
36 month 50,000 mile warranty
60/40 split fold down rear seats
the rear seats recline
cruise control
tilt steering
power windows/locks
fog lights
rear wiper
roof rack
and more

I've been driving it for 3 weeks now.  It has a lot of power and it is fun to drive.  I wasn't expecting so much kick in a heavy vehicle.  I can accelerate with the best cars at red lights and merge into traffic with ease.

There is plenty of room in the Tribute.  I have 2 car seats in the back.  One is rear facing and the other is forward facing.  There is a lot of head room as well as leg room.  I feel like I am sitting up high and have a good view.  It can fit 5 adults, but 4 adults would be comfortable.

There is also a lot of room in the trunk area.  The liner is great for groceries and so you don't get the back dirty.  The stereo system sounds great.  I love having 6 CDs ready to play.  We have gotten about 20 miles to the gallon so far with a lot of highway driving.  

I don't like that there is not a lock button for the whole car on the passenger side.  My husband will run into a store and lock us in the car for safety.  When he comes back I have to lean over to unlock his door.  The other problem that I have is the shifter.  It is big and on the right side of the steering wheel.  I have hit the window wiper by accident once.  It is also in front of the stereo volumne button.  Other than that is a great vehicle with a great price.  

Update:
I never use the cruise control before 1000 miles so I can not comment on how it works for me.  I have heard however, that it is great on highways but now so great on hills.  It can range 10 miles higher than the cruise speed on large hills.  I will update you in another month.  As far as the tilt steering, I have never been particular on the location of my steering wheel.  I have it set so the tribute steering is set like a car.  It is easy to change and comfortable.  I have not changed the oil yet, but the filter is easily reached if you do it yourself.  The manual recommends Mobil 1, which is what we previously used for our old car.

Last week someone backed into the Tribute.  I was at a complete stop and the other person reversed pretty hard on an angle.  The front bumper on the right side was dented out about 3 inches wide, 1 inch high.  It was $500 in damages.  The bumper cover needs to be replaced.  I expected to have damage because I was jolted.  In a smaller collision I would hope the bumper would survive.

I will update this periodically as I find out new things.
