            I am getting my parent's car.  They recently got a new Mercury and are giving me their old one.  Now while some might complain about getting an old car rather than a new one I am not complaining. Not only is the tag cheaper than if I went out and bought a new car, but it also runs just like new.  Yes my parents took real good care of it but it was also made incredibly well. The paint job looks excellent.  The styling still looks contemporary. There is no sign of UV damage on any of the exterior or interior. 

It drives tight. When I say that I mean it is responsive. When you turn the wheel it does what you tell it to.  It is highly agile.  It does not feel like your driving a sherman tank.  You don't have to have your foot to the floor to get it to go. In fact you can go about 15-20 without even touching the gas on a flat road. And when you DO have to get some speed it has the get up and go you need. 

It has all the bells and whistles you would want. Dad kids me about if I find the ejector seat don't press it. It has HUGE trunk space which is a plus cause I am in college again (graduated and going back for teacher certification) and have a lot to take back to college. The big trunk is also convenient when going to Walmart or going grocery shopping.
