            The shots you can make with this camera are awesome. The zoom is exceptional and close ups are terrific. I owned a 340 L Olympus prior to this one and I was impressed with it also. I traded up just for the zoom
capabilities, and was glad I did. The high-resolution 3X zoom lens plus the Digital Tele mode make possible photos equivalent to 7.5X zoom.
With all its features, the Olympus is surprisingly easy to learn. It offers slow shutter synchronization mode, macro mode, self-timer/remote control, panorama mode, digital tele mode, white balance, built in flash, and much more. It also has a place for an external flash hook up.
The instruction manual is very easy to use and understand. This is very important when it comes to being able to use all your camera's features.
The instructions not only uses text, but shows graphics of the camera feature being explained. In my judgement, the instruction manual is a major fact in deciding what digital camera to purchase. Be sure and check out the manual, as well as the camera.
The camera comes with a 4MB Smart Media Card (holds images), but can use 
an 8Mb, 16MB, or a 32MB card.  The number of pictures you can shoot on one card depends on the quality setting. I use an 8MB card in mine. 
The camera has a 1.8&quot; LCD monitor to view the photo after the shot and decide to keep it or delete it. Great for showing your photos off also.
The drawback to this camera is that, while being compact, it is sometimes
hard to hold while lining up your shot. If someone had large hands, it would make it more difficult to use. I have also had problems with the battery door not staying closed tightly at times.
After all is said and done though, I love this camera. It is well worth the price I paid for it. I got it for $475, which I consider my internet &quot;find&quot;. A true bargain.
After owning a Ricoh, and an Olympus 340 L, I rate my Olympus 2000 Z as top of the line. Cameras just keep getting better every year, but I like everything this one does, so I hope to keep it for a long time!
