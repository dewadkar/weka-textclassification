            I bought the 1995 Sentra GLE new in July, 1995, and it has been a delight ever since.  It has 90K miles on it now, and has never given me a day�s trouble.  It still gets over 30 MPG, even when driven briskly -- best mileage was 52 MPG on the highway.  By 1995 standards, it was competitively powered, very well loaded and priced and had a longer wheelbase than some of its competition.  It also handled very well during the test drive, and the 5-speed manual shifted smoothly.  Standard features included a power moonroof, remote keyless entry and security system, power windows and locks, plush velour seats, cruise and all the other things you would expect in this group.

The first thing I did was toss the pathetic factory tires in favor of wider 185/60 HR14 Bridgestone Potenza RE930�s.  For $250 for the set, what a HUGE difference they made in wet and dry performance, braking and acceleration.  The car keeps its grip without any squeal right until its limit.  As for the brakes, this non-ABS car�s pedal is a bit mushy, and the brakes grind a bit, which reduces confidence.  Overall though, braking performance is good.  In retrospect, I should have opted for the ABS just to get the 4-wheel discs, which would have improved pedal feel.  The wider, grippier tires helped in acceleration, which is good, when the engine is turning above 2800 RPM � but get the manual, because the automatic is sluggish.  Handling is consistent and very good, even though the car leans a little more than I would like through a hard turn.  The ride is smooth with a front seat passenger, but can be a little bouncy over big bumps with three rear seat passengers or heavy trunk cargo.

Fit and finish are excellent.  Not even the roofliner makes a sound with the moonroof all the way open.  Parts fit together well, but a little softer plastic would be a nice touch.  Interior color contrasts are also good.  Ergonomics are excellent, with everything exactly where you would expect it to be.  And a very nice touch is that the dash is designed so that in 6 years I�ve never had glare on my gauges.  The windows and moonroof came with factory tinting.  I wish the steering wheel were leather, and a little fatter on this top of the line Sentra.  

The electrical system could be better.  I had to have the alternator replaced.  Unrelated, although annoying are three lights out on the climate controls because of a loose wire.  

Trunk space is adequate, and very good with the rear seats folded.  The exhaust is original, as is the clutch. I change the oil religiously every 3K miles, usually at a Nissan dealer.  Nissan told me to expect 250K miles from the engine based on its maintenance record.

Overall, I highly recommend this car.  It has never disappointed me.
