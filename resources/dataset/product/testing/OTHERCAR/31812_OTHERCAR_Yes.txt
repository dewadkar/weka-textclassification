            My Wife and I recently bought a 2000 Civic EX and we LOVE the car to death! Buying Civic's runs in both families. She has a 1991 Civic LX Sedan(automatic) with 5 billion miles or so on it and it runs like .. eh.. not new.. but close.. and I had a 1993 Civic EX coupe(5-speed) for 2 years and put about 30,000 miles a year on it(about 25,000 miles a year RACING it, my 7 speeding tickets are proof of that).  but as soon as we found out that we were getting a little bundle of joy in our household, we decided we needed a family car instead of my raced out Civic Coupe. So, we went straight to the Honda Dealer in town a bought a 2000 Civic Sedan EX with a little over 200 miles on it(they needed to drive it down from Idaho, because we wanted the Black 5-speed model, and apparently no dealers in Utah like Black 5-speeds)! Anyway, all you people saying that this car is cheap, need to think again.. this car with tax and lic. fees was $19K plus. A little over our budget, but we decided if we wanted to get into debt, it would be on this Sweet car! To Ride in this car is kind of a snoozer, It does have good pick up in the High Revs(5000+ rpms), but below that is just cruisin'. The Gearbox and Shifts are slushy but smooth, and the Comfort is amazingly nice. The roll on this car has to be it's downfall... when will honda learn to put Stiffer suspensions in their cars? Anyway, My final verdict on this car is... If you are going to Spend almost $20,000 on a car, buy this one! - It may not seem like you are driving a $20,000 car to other people, but other people aren't driving your car.. so DROP A GEAR, DISAPPEAR, and show them VTEC is KING!<br><br>
