            We were very pleased with GM's newly redesigned replacement series for the ailing S-10 platform SUV's.  GM really did great in both the powertrain and styling areas of this vehicle.  For this vehicle, GM introduced the new Vortec(R) 4200 L-6 engine.  This engines engineering and design is now the basis of both the GMC Canyon and Chevrolet Colorado engines.  The engine is both powerful, and smooth because of the straight firing order.
*********************Exterior***************************
GM really did a great job redesigning the Trailblazer, Envoy, Bravada, Rainer line-ups for 2002-2004.  They all look cleaner and more refined on their edges.  Fit and finish has also improved a great deal on these vehicles.  Our Envoy has a kind of "happy" front cap.  For a more aggressive front cap, I suggest looking into the Chevrolet Trailblazer with it's "Cats Eye" headlights.  It looks like a European design and has nice body lines.  Our Envoy came with the SLE package that does not have a chrome strip in the doors.  On the SLT package, a chrome styling strip is inserted into the doors.  Our vehicle also came with the Polished 16" wheels.  The wheels in the summer look very nice and when washed, almost luxurious.  The exterior mirrors came with a standard heater, and on the SLT package, you can get the blinker light on the mirror bottom.  They are a nice touch to the vehicle's detail on the outside.
********************Interior******************************
Our interior is the custom black cloth.  This cloth is very comfortable, and the seats are set at a nice angle.  There is ample leg room in both the front and the back.  The back is very comfortable, and it comes with a climate control system control panel for the back.  It is nice to be able to control the power and the intensity of the air coming out.  The drivers side has a very nice setup in the instrument gage cluster.  It is easy to see where everything is, and it is organized well.  The interior also comes with a standard "Carbon Fiber and Aluminum" accent package, but on the upgraded SLT comes with a rosewood accent package which is more luxurious.  The climate control system is very easy to use, and is dual-zone for different temperatures for the passenger and driver.  On the SLT package, it comes standard with an automatic climate control system.  You do not have to do or set anything because the sensors and computers do everything for you.  In the cargo storage area, it comes standard with a "trap door" storage system.  You can store your emergency kits or even hide presents in this area because it has a cover that is flush with the floor.  The back seats are also very easy to fold down if you need to extend the cargo areas capacities.  The transmission shifter is easy to use, and is placed in a good area.  The front dashboard seems to be very solid and well built.  It seems like nothing could ever break the dashboard.
*********************Engine****************************
The engine that came standard on our Envoy was the Vortec(R) 4200 L-6 with 275 Horsepower.  It has great acceleration, and it is quiet.  Another advantage of having an L-6 design is because it has a firing order which causes it to be smoother than the "V" system.  The EXT and XL stretch versions have an optional 5.3 Vortec V8 optional that produces 295 horsepower.  Our Tahoe that we own has this engine and it runs excellent and acclerates excellent.  Our 4200 also starts up very well, even after we have gone on a 4 week vacation, it started right up the second we wanted it to.
********************Suspension**************************
Our suspension is the all coil spring system.  On the SLT, an air-ride suspension comes standard.  The frame is hydroformed, this makes it more stronger and gives a nicer ride.  Our vehicle rides very softly and is very smooth on even dirt roads.  But keep in mind, this vehicle is not a Cadillac, and will not ride as smoothly.  Since this vehicle is designed on a truck suspension, this causes it to ride more like a truck, but somewhat smoother.
********************Drivetrain***************************
Our vehicle came with the 2WD system with rear locking differential and traction control.  Without the 4 wheel drive, this is the best to get on the 2 wheel drive package.  The rear locker stops the wheel that has not traction, and gives all power to the wheel that still has it.  The traction control is also nice in the snow because it reduces power to the wheels, and gives the axle maximum torque.  But, I still suggest to get the 4 wheel drive system since it is much easier to get in and out of a snow covered driveway and road.
********************Features*****************************
Our vehicle's standard features were as follows...
Power windows, locks, keyless entry, tilt wheel, mirror heaters, dual zone climate control, CD and RDS capable radio, deluxe cloth, lumbar support, towing package with 2" receiver hitch, tinted windows, power steering, and full size spare tire.  
The options we bought with our vehicle were...
Rear locking differential, traction control, polished aluminum wheels.
*******************Final Thoughts***********************
Since we started leasing this vehicle, we have been really happy with it in both the performance, and styling areas.  This vehicle is very dependable, and reflects GM's capability to design a great powertrain system.  GM has set a new level for all other companies to build their new SUV's and it is especially showing in the new Chrysler Magnum.  I would suggest to anybody that this car is a great vehicle that is packed with features.
