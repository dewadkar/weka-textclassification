            I first bought this camera because I was always looseing my film and prints. Now I am glad I did because I have already saved hundreds of dollars on not buying film. This camera has a great low price and is perfect for someone that is new to digital cameras. I use the pictures to put on my web site and to send to my friends. The 850,000 pixels make the pictures of a great quality look lifelike. Digital cameras are going to put film companies out of buissness and now that I have a digital camera I can certainly see why.<br><br>
