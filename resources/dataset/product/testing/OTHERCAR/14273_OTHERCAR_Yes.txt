            Mazda have always signified &quot;innovation&quot; &amp; the rotary powered RX-7 is the pinnacle of this form. Released onto the world stage in 1992 the 3rd generation of this famous sports car dropped the trimmings &amp; ergonomics of the previous version to concentrate solely on the job of an out-right sports car.

Perfected on the track before it's debut, this version was all out getting from point to point quicker than the next guy with the finesse of a prestige German marque. It is also that fine German sports car company that opened it's wallets to try &amp; out do the RX-7 on the track only to be embarrassed in 92-93-94-95 (Australian 12 hour production race) aswell as numerous production car wins throughout the world against other rivals beside Porsche. 

To show age cannot faulter it's extra-ordinary &quot;power-to-weight&quot; design, Mazda re-entered the 99 Australian production car endurance race after a 4 year absence to WIN against the latest from Porsche, Ferrari &amp; other hi-powered machinery such as the Viper GTS.

A purpose built sports car was always going to be about compromise &amp; the 2 seats for the export versions should have had the option of rear seating like the domestic one. The rotary engine is already legendary &amp; symbolizes Mazda. It's simply too easy to squeeze extra power from a rotary if one isn't happy with 255hp as standard. Mazda know this which is why the current version (sold only in Japan) has 280hp as standard.

If you need this car as your everyday drive to work machine then you are going to be sadly disappointed with it's ergonomics. A long trip will take it's toll on the back &amp; bum too. So it's recommended as a 2nd car for the garage. Take it for a weekend drive or out at a club race day &amp; your going to be wishing you had owned one sooner. 

The seating is excellent (remember, it's not designed to be a lounge chair like Dads Cadillac) &amp; the steering is exceptional matched perfectly to the handling &amp; power characteristics that only a rotary powered vehicle can produce.<br><br>
