            I purchased a tribute lx 4x4 with sunroof tow package and abs/side airbag. I was a little concerned about ford and the firestone tires but after driving it I loved it. I had a hard time finding one for I am impatient and could not wait 8-10 weeks. I searched all over the internet and found the one with all the options I wanted. I went that day and bought it after driving several others at other dealerships. I find the tribute to be a powerhouse for a six cylinder I cant believe how well the truck handles.I have driven several others and they feel like I was driving a truck.At night the lighting is superb and the view is great.The truck is high enough to see all around but not too high to climb into. The seats could be a little better but for the most part not bad.the fuel mileage I feel is not as good as they say I have a hard time in city getting 16 miles per gallon. But its worth the drive. I feel safe in this suv.I have always had a car and decided to try an suv. I know I made the right decision. I am hooked and dont think I can get a car again.I am a little worried about the tires but I will keep an eye on them.If anyone is considering this then I would definately agree with that decision and highly recommend it to anyone. I have already recommended it to other family members.good luck and good safe driving.zoom zoom gotta try it please rate my opinion especially if it helped at all or want more info<br><br>
