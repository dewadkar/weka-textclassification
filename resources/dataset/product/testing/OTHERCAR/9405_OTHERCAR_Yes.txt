            With four kids driving and budgeting college expenses the 1999 Wolfsburg edition was a smart choice for our family.  The Jetta was purchased for our daughter and the 9 hour drive home from college.  VW has offered a practical car loaded with the extras that offer a sense of luxury.  The CD player was a must and the security system offers worried parents piece of mind.  The ride is smooth and the vehicle hugs the road nicely.   The standard 100,000 mile power train warranty is an added benefit.  

Caution noted on issues with the power windows.  Our vehicle has experienced motor burn outs in 3 of 4 windows within a two year period.  VW customer care has stepped up to the plate and repaired these windows ($300 plus repair per window) and admitted problems with the motor manufacturer's product for the 1999 Jetta.

The  few headaches with the windows haven't dampened our enthusiasm and affordability with the VW Jetta.  Another daughter heads to college in the fall and we'll be shopping for another Jetta!<br><br>
