            We have had our Cougar for about 4 years, it is a 1991. It has a 5 liter V-8 fuel injected engine in it and man is it quick. It has about 130,000 miles on it and still runs great. It has a digital dash board on it that makes every thing very easy to see and read. It comes with an excellent sound system in it with a CD player. And I mean it sounds great. It will put most home stereo's to shame. About everything in it is power. Seats, windows, side view mirrors, seat belts, and even rear view mirror. 
There is plenty of room in the back seat for three passengers and two bucket seats in the front, so this could surly be used for a family car. It has anti lock brakes. Brakes on a dime. The handling is great, corners tight and comes back straight nice and easy. I can't think of a thing that I don't like about this car. It get about 24 miles to the gallon on the highway and about 18 in the city. I only gave $6,500 for this car back in 1996, and I think I got one heck of a deal. I would highly recommend the Mercury Cougar to any one that want a great car. I don't know much about the new ones, I hear they did away with the V-8's but the 6 cyclinders are suppose to be a fast car also. I don't like the body's on the new cougar as well as the body on the older ones.     <br><br>
