            After driving an 89 Chevy conversion van for the first one and a half years of my "driving life", I ended up purchasing a 94 Chrysler LHS from a family friend.  You may be wondering how a 17 year old could afford a luxury automobile, so let me explain.  I purchased it from a family friend for $6500 (it had 69,000 miles), and that much I had saved up from years of cutting lawns and working anywhere that I could.  

My first experience with the car was driving it out of my friend's driveway the day I purchased it from her: it was in the middle of the biggest snowstorm/icestorm that I can remember (I live in Michigan), in January of 1999.  As soon as I pulled out onto the main road, the traction control kicked in.  There were layers of ice and snow on the road, but I felt very safe in this car.  Whenever it started to slip, that traction control system would "save" me.  The traction control has been invaluable for the past few years... it really helps during rain and snowstorms.  

The car is quite responsive, and gets an average of 20 miles per gallon, which is great considering it's size.  It is a 4 door sedan, large, but not quite a boat (Lincoln or Cadillac).  For me, it's the perfect size.  I can comfortably seat 3 adults in the back seat (teenagers are adults if they are over 18, correct?), and 2 people in the front... and everybody has ample legroom and headroom.  The trunk is also HUGE!  The car is full of amenities... a sunroof, leather seats, a nice sound system, collapsible cupholders, etc.  I especially like the heating/cooling system.  If you change the temperature 1 degree, you can actually feel the difference in the car!  It is very precise.

Despite the fact that I really like this car, I have had quite a few problems that I must share to make this a fair review.  I will start with the recalls, and the dates that I had the recall-work done:

1.  Air-Conditioning system warranty extended to 70,000 miles
2.  Fuel O-Rings and reinforcements  (07/99)
3.  Lower Control Arm Bracket (03/00)
4.  Power Seat Adjuster (This one wasn't mandatory, I haven't gotten around to it yet)

Let's begin with the Air Conditioning problems:  During the summer of 1999, when I turned on my air conditioner, it would emit this horrible smell (the only thing to compare it to would be something like a skunk), which made me sick to my stomach.  The air coming out was still chilled, but the smell was unbearable.  After taking the car to the dealer (= the thieves who told me that I "definitely needed an entirely new Air conditioning system" for over $2000), I took it to a friendly shop and they replaced the Evaporator (around $500 for parts and labor), and I have never had any problems with the air conditioner since.  According to the previous owners (who bought the car new), these cars were notorious for their air conditioning problems, which was why the warranty on the air conditioning systems was extended.  The previous owners told me that they had the air conditioning system repaired several times over the years.  Unfortunately, the problems started for me at around 74,000 miles, so I had to pay for it myself.

My water pump went out in 2000, and the car overheated.  Thankfully, nothing else was damaged... but until June of this year, I didn't really have any other major problems.  A minor problem involved the CD player... which broke.  The radio still works nicely, but the CD player just won't play CDs anymore... at all.

This year, I had to replace all of my spark plugs, the ignition wires, and... I had to have the transmission rebuilt.  I suppose at 90,000 miles this is expected, but I wasn't happy.  Also, I replaced the front struts, strut mounts, and ball joints (around $350 total).  Another problem that I have had is a lack of power steering.  Apparently, the car has some problem with the rack and pinion which is expensive to fix, so I have been without power steering for years, but I'm used to it.

Despite all of these problems (some of which may be related to my mileage), I still think that this is a great car.  Like I said above, it has many nice features, and is very reliable overall.  I have only had to stop on the side of the road once in three years (when it overheated), and that was partly my fault because the mechanic told me that the water pump was leaking and that I should replace it as soon as possible.  I have seen these cars advertised as low as $3500-4000 used, and I think that they are worth every penny.

I hope that this helps you in your decision to buy a used 94 LHS!
