            Infiniti has done it again.  This entertaining, stylish, and luxurious car represents an <i>excellent</i> value in the $20,000 to $25,000 import 4-door segment, beating the stuffing out of all it's competitors. I'm talking about style, comfort, utility, standard equipment, reliability, product quality, economy, overall value, sportiness, handling, ownership experience, and of course, <i>prestige.</i>

Yes, that's a mouthful, and those are lofty claims, but it really is the truth.  Sure, for the price of a 2000 Infiniti G20 you could have a Camry, Accord, Galant, or any number of domestic or imported sedans, many of which are larger (on the outside) --But you would <i>not</i> be buying an <i>Infiniti</i>, and you would be stuck driving the same boring &quot;built-for-the-masses&quot; ho-hum family sedan as the Jonses (and the Johnsons, the Smiths, the Andersons, etc.).

To begin with, the styling of the G20 is far more sporty and sleek than any of the above.  It's rear end is a work of art, offering a stylish design with a high decklid (sporty), and just a touch of elegantly-done chrome.

From the front, it looks low and sleek. The windshield is raked nicely, but does not infringe on front-seat headroom.  The signature Infiniti twin-vertical chrome grill clearly makes the statement that you are driving an Infiniti, and the overall appearance is one of a European sports sedan.

The G20's side profile is long, low and sleek, reminding some of the previous-generation BMW 3-series (due to the shape of the C-pillar).  This car actually has a surprisingly long wheelbase, the effects of which are immediately noticeable inside the cabin in the form of more rear-seat leg room than anything else in it's size-class.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I fit quite comfortably in the back seats of the G20, with plenty of room to spare (and I am 6' tall/240 lbs).  I guess I was expecting the back seat of a Honda Civic or something, but the G20 is MUCH bigger inside than you would ever expect.

The front seats are extremely comfortable, offering plenty of hip and thigh support.  A welcome touch, the beefy side bolsters (lateral support) keep you comfortably and firmly in place when the car's innate nature to take corners at twice the posted speed limit makes itself known (which it will, I promise).

Everything inside the cabin looks and feels great, and the materials used are obviously of the highest quality (no surprise in an Infiniti).  The leather is supple, yet at the same time very thick and durable.  the plastics are of the highest grade, and all the switchgear has that high-quality, built-to-last-a-lifetime feel to it.

The standard (and only avaiable) sound system is a 6 speaker, 100 watt Bose setup that is specifically tuned to the interior acoustis of the G20.  The result is incredibly clear, powerful and accurate reproduction of your favorite tapes or CDs (it plays both).  A trunk-mounted 6 disc CD changer is optional.

An excellent value, the Leather and Convienence package gives you a tremendous amount of stuff for your money: the delicious leather interior, power glass sunroof with sunshade, power driver's seat, and the automatic climate control with HVAC microfilter --all for $1,500 on the G20 Luxury model.  This same package actually costs less on the G20t (it's $1,200), because the automatic climate control is standard equipment on the &quot;t&quot; (Touring) model.

The differences between the G20 and the G20t are both functional and cosmetic.  The Touring model (G20t) is the sportier car (think of it as a sport package), providing lower-profile tires, a viscous limited-slip differential, a tasteful spoiler on the rear deck, integrated fog lights and sport headrests.  When equipped with the Leather and Convienence package (factory installed only), the price difference between the G20 and the G20t is only $1,200, with the G20t being the more expensive at $25,519.

How about safety?  The G20 leads the pack here too.  Front and side head/chest airbags, 4-wheel disc brakes, ABS, tube-style side-impact door beams, front and rear crumple zones, and a rock-solid safety-cage passenger cell are all built right into the G20.  This car is probably as safe as a Volvo.  It is certainly as solid.

However, the single biggest safety feature is without a doubt the way the car handles.  The G20 is <i>incredibly</i> agile.  Intuitive reactions from the suspension and steering give the driver an almost erie feeling of having the functional control of the car directly linked to his or her brain.  This car <i>really</i> is that responsive.  try an accident-avoidance maneuver (like a sudden, high-speed lane change) in a Camry, and you will wrestle with the car for at least 3 seconds once you crank the wheel to remain in control of the vehicle.  In the G20, the car instinctively just goes where you point it, allowing you to remain in total control of the vehicle.

Now for the fun part.  The G20 seems to have been created for driving hard on twisty mountain roads.  Cornering in this car is an absolute delight.  Straight, boring roads will become your enemy; the thief of fun.  This car will hands-down outhandle any of it's direct competitors,including any offering from Acura, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Ford, GM, Volvo, Mitsubishi, etc.  For some odd reason, Lexus does not have a competitor in this price range --and this car will outhandle <i>any</i> Lexus anyway).

The G20's only shortcoming is its lack of accelerative oomph.  The 145hp inline 4 cylinder engine is without a doubt a fantastic engine (loves to rev, very responsive, reliable, etc.), but when paired with the automatic transmission, the car feels slightly sluggish off the line.  Not to worry, though: once the revs build a bit, this car definitely goes.  In my humble opinion, choosing the 5-speed is a no-brainer in this car (and it lowers the price a bit too).

Another outstanding quality of the G20 is it's impressive list of standard equipment.  Check the list out for yourself below.  A lot of these things are optional on the G20s competitors.

Standard equipment in the G20:

-145hp DOHC 16 valve engine (30+ mpg on the highway)
-4-wheel disc brakes
-ABS (anti-lock braking system)
-Front driver and passenger airbags
-Front side head/chest airbags
-60/40 split folding rear seats
-A gargantuan trunk (no kidding)
-front and rear cupholders
-rear-seat center armrest
-Power windows
-Power door locks
-Power mirrors
-Power steering/brakes
-Tilt steering column
-Three-point seat belts in all 5 seating positions
-Three child seat anchors on the rear parcel shelf

-6 speaker 100 watt custom-tuned Bose CD/tape audio system
-Air conditioning
-Rear defroster
-100,000 mile tune-up free engine/transmission/driveline

...And lots more too!  And check out the industry-leading warranty:

6 year/70,000 mile powertrain warranty
4 year/60,000 mile comprehensive warranty
7 year/unlimited milage corrosion warranty
4 year/60,000 mile Infiniti roadside assistance

Of course, choosing the G20 over it's lesser competitors also gets you one of the most reliable, highest-quality automobiles money can buy.  Not to mention that it <i>is</i> an Infiniti product, so the service you will receive throughout the ownership experience is red-carpet all the way.  You even get an <i>Infiniti</i> loaner car (G20 or I30) when you bring the car in for service (with no minimum service time required!).

I apologize if this opinion sounds like an advertisement for Infiniti, but I really do believe in Infiniti products.  Across the board, Infiniti really <i>does</i> offer the best value for your money, and there is no question that Infiniti automobiles are of at least as high quality (if not even higher) than those from Lexus, their biggest competitor.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that Lexus over-prices their vehicles (substantially) as well.

Like the advertising says, own one and you'll understand.  This is no understatement.  Just ask anyone who owns an Infiniti how they like their car.  Then try and shut them up while they rave about the car and the great service they enjoy for the next hour. :-)<br><br>
