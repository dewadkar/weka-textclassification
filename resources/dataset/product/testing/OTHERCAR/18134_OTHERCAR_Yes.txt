            I love my Highlander.  We got the Limited and it is the most comfortable and smoothest-riding SUV I have been in.  The interior is set up well and everything is easy to get to.  The in-dash CD changer is a great option I would recommend.  The seats are very comfortable and although I havent been a big fan of leather in the past these seats are great.
The engine is very quiet and gets good gas mileage for a 6-cyl SUV.  While road noise is also minimal there is a strange aerodynamic issue when only the rear windows are rolled down.  At highway speeds it sounds (and feels) like a helicopter is taking off.  Opening one of the other windows or sun roof alleviates the problem though so for us it's a minor one.
The handling is also top notch for an SUV.  It drives very much like a car (it should, it's on the Camery frame) and I have never felt like it wanted to roll over.
I had an Explorer (or "Exploder" as the Toyota salesman called them) previously and it was loaded with options so I do miss a few of the simple things I had before like a compartment just for Kleenex and a change dispenser.  These are small items, but i consciously miss them now that I dont have them.  But the ride of the Highlander never makes me miss the Explorer.
