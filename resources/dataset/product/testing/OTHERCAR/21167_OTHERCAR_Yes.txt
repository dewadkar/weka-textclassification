            After evaluating numerous sports sedans in the $28,000 - $35,000 range, I ended up paying just under $40k for a Platinum Series GS300.  I absolutely have no regrets about spending the extra cash.  The other cars on my &quot;short list&quot; were the BMW 323i and 328i, Chrysler 300M, Acura TL and Lincoln LS.  These are the reasons I purchased the GS instead.

1) Great stereo.  If you are an audiophile, Lexus is the make for you.  The standard 215 watt, seven speaker system is one of the best I've heard in a car.  I've modified or replaced the audio systems in every car I've had for the past 24 years, but did not want to tear into a brand new luxury car that cost more than the house I grew up in.  If you really want to go overboard, you can get an optional Nakamichi system, that's even better.  But they bundle it with other goodies, so be prepared to pay an extra $4000 for the Nak.

2) Excellent combination of power, handling and comfort.  If you must have the Ultimate Driving Machine, buy a BMW.  You won't be sorry.  But the sport suspension BMWs can be a little harsh, and you'll find the Lexus to be more luxurious and more reliable.  And the dealers pamper you.  Don't worry, the GS handles great.  You may notice in some reviews that the GS400 handles better than the standard GS300.  That's because the GS400 goes out with better tires.  The Platinum GS300 has wider, grippier tires that give it that &quot;glued to the road&quot; feel.  Steering is excellent.  The inline six has continuously variable valve timing that provides plenty of torque at all speeds, so this car is faster than you might think with a &quot;mere&quot; 220 horsepower.  But if 0 to 60 in 7.5 seconds isn't enough for you, get the GS400, which does it in 5.7.

3) Reliability.  That eliminated Chrysler and Lincoln from the competition.  The Big Three still ship cars out of the factory that have problems like loose trim and flaws in the paint.  You will never find that in a Lexus.

4) Luxury.  I've always admired the interior and exterior designs of the Lexus line.  They are elegant, with first rate materials, fit and finish.  The Lincoln and Acura had fake wood.  It's bird's eye maple in the Platinum GS, an element that even my four year old can appreciate.  (&quot;Daddy, that's a nice piece of wood.&quot;)  The seats are supportive, yet comfortable, with very high backs.  All four windows have auto up and auto down.  The seats, mirrors and even the seat belt harness are all motorized with memory.  Very useful for us, as my wife is nearly a foot shorter than me.  The electrochromic mirrors are amazing.  You have to drive a GS at night to truly appreciate it.  And I love the back lit full analog gauges.  I find crammed-together gauges with &quot;half a tach&quot; annoying.  And this car is dead quiet inside.

5) Reliability.  Lexus is known for trouble free cars and no arguments from the dealer if anything is not to your liking.

6) I wasn't going to mention prestige because it doesn't matter to me.  (In addition to the GS, I have a 13 year old, two wheel drive pickup truck.  I'm still the same person no matter which vehicle I drive.) For those who do care, Lexus is the most revered brand in Northern California, along with BMW and Mercedes.

The ultimate car for me would have been the GS400 with the Nakamichi audio.  But I do want my daughter to go to college, and besides, this still leaves me something to dream about in my next car.<br><br>
