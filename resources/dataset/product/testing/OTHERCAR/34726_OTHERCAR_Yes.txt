            The Chrysler Sebring, definitely a great advance in Chrysler's lineup. This car is a great buy if you would like to get the upscale model. The lower end model, JX costs just as much as a Camaro z28, Or Pontiac Firebird Transam. Roughly around the 26000 dollar price range. Its a great car to drive, lots of pep and eager horses under the hood waiting to take off. There are some flaws in the car though. The JX comes with a cloth interior, a tape deck/radio, no fog lights, floor mats are not considered &quot;standard&quot;. The optional vinyl seats are horrific, they feel like you are sitting on rocks. The JXi is a great bargain for the money, around 28000 dollars. It comes standard with a CD player, great sound system, fog lights, floor mats are &quot;standard&quot; The JXi also comes with rims instead of wheel covers which is a nice extra. The limited sebring is the best bargain of them all, a base price around 29000 dollars, every option you can think of is in here. Standard leather seats, more horsepower!!!Wood trim, and a great stereo. If you are looking for a convertible with lots of leg room, and i mean lots this the car for you. Even with the drivers seat pushed all the way back, i could still sit extremely comfortably in the back seat, and I am 6'1. An excellent decision for the person who wants a convertible and has a large family.<br><br>
