            This digital camera is used by professionals mainly.  I use it in the mountains for nature pictures.  I have found this to be great because it isn't bulky.  The dimensions are 150x101x117 mm, and is 60% of the classical 35mm camera in volume and weight.

This digital has 8.1 MB file and is PC MAC compatible.  It accepts typeI and typeII PCMCIA cards(meomory cards).  The image quality is superb at 2.7 million pixels, which in lamens terms means that this gives the picture more depth and character.

Seeing as to how I travel with my camera I simply carry with me some extra AA batteries(this camera takes four).  Or if you are going to be using the camera indoors it also has an AC adapter.  

The Minolta RD 3000 has the ability to do wide angle work, it also contains the versatility of many Minolta V mount lenses and several flashes.  This bad boy shoots at bursts of 1.5 FPS for five frames.  It has a 2 inch LCD display for easy viewing.

The Minolta RD 3000 comes with a one year warranty which i felt wasn't enough because I paid so much so I purchased an additional three year warranty.  I also purchased an additional accessory that has allowed me to step away from the camera, this accessory being a remote control.

All in all this is a great camera.  I wouldn't trade it for any other.<br><br>
