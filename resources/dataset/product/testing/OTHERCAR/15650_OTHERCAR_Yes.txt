            The Sony Mavica MVC-FD91 is almost the perfect digital camera. With a superior optical quality and �big enough� image size coupled with the convenience of the floppy disk, you really can�t go wrong. 
The number one plus is the floppy disk format. On a standard 3.5 inch floppy you can store from 7-10 (1024x768) or 20-26 (640x480) images on one disk. I recently took this camera on vacation and shot over 1500 images. Yes, I took a lot of floppies along, but most of you probably have many floppies you no longer use, not to mention the old AOL floppies you used to get in the mail. I carried floppies, but I didn't need a computer with me on the trip to �recharge� my memory card. In addition, it allowed me to take as many pictures as I wanted because you can always find a floppy. Try finding an extra memory card in some small town in Arizona. With the copy a disk in the camera feature, I even gave an entire disk to a tourist from Canada that expressed interest in my camera. I received an e-mail from him when he arrived home and he was very impressed.
Of course there are many features including the 14x optical zoom. I emphasize the �optical� part. This is a true glass lens that gives superior quality to a digital zoom especially when coupled with the image stabilization. Remember, a digital zoom is re-arranging the pixels and that almost always leads to image degradation.
Another must have feature is the two-way view finder. Sure the LCD is nice and very convenient because it moves in just about any direction, however it�s almost useless in direct sunlight. The eyepiece on the viewer has a diopter for those of you with bad eyes like me.
So why do I say it is almost perfect? The FD-91 has a pathetic flash! It can only be called weak at best, dropping off sharply on anything much past 6 feet. So if you�re spelunking and trying to take pictures in your favorite cave, you�re out of luck with this camera. It does perform acceptable in low light however. In a well-lighted banquet room, I was able to take pictures easily without flash and the color correction worked beautifully in any lighting. 
A little tip if you buy this camera. You can use an exterior flash with the camera. I broke out my old Vivitar 283 flash, attached a slave trigger to it, and held it forward enough to �see� the flash from the FD-91 and got some pretty good results. The ability to set f-stop and shutter speed on this camera makes this possible. Set your flash for ASA 100 and the corresponding f-stop at 1/60 of a second on the FD-91 and you�re shooting, in auto. I�ve even used it with a studio strobe set-up.
I would have to rate this camera a �sure bet� unless you�re going to be shooting lots of pictures in dark places. For that matter, I don�t know if any of the digital cameras in this price range have good flashes.
