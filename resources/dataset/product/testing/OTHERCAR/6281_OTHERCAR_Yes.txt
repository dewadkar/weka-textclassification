            I bought my 1995 Mitsubishi Galant after a bad experience with a Cavalier of the same year. My original intention was to buy a car for college transportation. 

The first thing that I noticed during the test drive was that the power windows were awkward, and didn't perform correctly at times. Later, I tested the cigarette lighter, just to assure my self that it worked. It popped out and began to melt in to the plastic below it. 

I ended up buying the car at the VERY reasonable price of $4995. When I purchased the car, it had less than 50,000 miles on it.   The 4 cyl 2.4 L was more than enough power for my Galant.. 

One of the things that I didn't really care for on the Galant was the unusual amount of road noise. I hate road noise. Also, even though the seats had more adjustments than Rube-Goldberg type device, I could never quite get comfortable. 

My Galant gave me perfect service for the three months that I had it. I sold it without effort at $5995, what a bargain!
