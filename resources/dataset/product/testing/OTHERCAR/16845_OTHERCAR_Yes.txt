            I used to own a 92 Taurus wagon but with my growing family it was time for a change and the Lumina had what i was looking for.The Lumina is an odd looking vehicle but it has get up and go when you need it.The seven bucket seats that come out so easily when you need space is a major plus because you can customize it to suit your needs.It did take some time to get used to the huge windshield but now it a breeze.My van is pretty much plainjane no toys but rear heat and air with privacy glass ! but that's all I need.The 3.4 litre plants the power to the pavement right when you ask for it no delays .It has great fuel consumption but it costs me a few bucks at fill up time with a huge tank but that's ok because i love to drive it everywhere.I was greatly surprised how well it goes through the snow in northern Ontario as long as you have a set of all season tires you are fine.At highway speeds it cruises like a dream passing anything in its way but i would like a little more HP but 180 isn't to bad for a minivan.I would recommend this van to anybody with a family or even just a couple looking for the perfect cross country traveller.But i wouldn't trade it for anything now.<br><br>
