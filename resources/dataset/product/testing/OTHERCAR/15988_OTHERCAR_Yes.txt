            The montero is the best luxury 4x4, in my opinion, on the market today. While others are starting to apear such as the lexus model. The Montero has been around for years but the basics of the SUV have not changed. The newer models have more luxury but they have not sacrificed there off road capabilitys. 

Off Road:

The Montero can go through two feet of water, as stated in the manual, I have gone through deeper, it is great in Sand and mud, both of which I have tackled. But the most impressive aspect of it's off road capabilitys is how it handels snow. I have gone through 4 foot snow drifts like they were confetti. On roads the suv can handel it's own, but off road is were it shines. Unlike other suv's that are simply rased up cars aka the Benzs suv , or trucks with extra seats like the ford expadision, the montero is a true SUV. Also what makes this a great suv is the fact that it is a great size. 

On Road: The suv has great head room but does not feel top heavy, on turns the montero does lean but does not feel as if it will roal over, like the Rodeo. The extra child seats in the back are geat and have served me very well, also the fact that they fold to the side keeps them out of the way when not in use. Over all I feel that the Montero fills the gap between the nomal sized suvs and the huge boats, and it fills that gap perfectly, with power and grace.<br><br>
