            I bought my truck after a month of looking around at lots, adds, and the net and i'm glad I held out. this truck does everything i want and more. My family of six fits comfortably inside and I have lots of room in the bed for groceries or camping stuff. I have the 4.8L V-8 motor and It runs smooth as silk. About a month after I got this truck my friend bought an F150 extended cab and after looking his truck over i'm happy I chose the GMC. I've had this truck since AUG of 2001 and went from San Diego to Oregon and back in comfort that I would not have had if I had gotten the F150.

UPDATE: 11JAN04 - 40,000 miles later and i still love it! 6 months ago my neighbor went out and got a 2003 sierra because he liked my truck so much!
