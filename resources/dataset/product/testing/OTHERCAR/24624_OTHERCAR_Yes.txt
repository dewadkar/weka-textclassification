            227 horsepower from normally-aspirated 3.0 liter V6?? That's what I call amazing. I have driven with this engine, and its great. This year, Infiniti has increased the horsepower. Last year the I30 ONLY had 190 horses. The engine is quiet, and it accelerates very quickly, anywhere. There is a hill in town, which is very steep, maybe a 10% to 15% grade. Most cars go up it at about 25-30 mph, but the I30 will accelerate to 40-45 mph in six or seven seconds, and the engine stays pretty quiet. 

We can drive around sharp turns at about 50, and the car holds its ground. Granted, it rocks side to side for a few seconds, but it can take the turns at very fast speeds. Riding in this car, I don't understand how Infiniti made such a great luxury sports sedan, for such a low cost. 

The interior is large in the front, and cramped in the back, but with the redesign, the space has increased, and allows larger people to sit back there. The interior is luxurious and 

ABS is now standard which is a good thing. The ABS I had actually saved my life. There was snow on the ground, and we went into the stop a little to fast, and started to skid, but ended up stopping in no time.

The only obvious problem with this car is the styling. Visually, this car is very different from the Maxima, something that has plagued the I30. Usually the grill is the only thing that Nissan changes for the I30. The grill is different, but other parts of the car are also. If you look at the two cars next to each other, then you'll notice they are the same. 

I don't think someone should buy this car because it is very similar to  Maxima. It is about $9,000 more, and I don't think that it is worth the extra price. The Maxima GLE, which costs $26,000 comes with almost everything that the I30 does. Leather, CD, Keyless Entry and Power everything. The only things that are worth the cost are the Whiplash-Preventing seats, and the fact that it is an Infiniti and not just a Nissan. But, I don't think they are worth the extra money. The base Maxima, the GXE is only $21,000 and still has all the important features as standard equipment. And, what I think is the most important feature of all: THE MAXIMA HAS A MANUAL TRANSMISSION. With such a powerful engine, the manual can only make the experience better. 

I give this three stars only because there isn't a compelling reason to buy it over the Maxima.<br><br>
