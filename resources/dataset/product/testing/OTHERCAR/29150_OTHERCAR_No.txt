            The 5 megapixel E20N doesn&#146t correct the limits in the design of the E10. The Olympus engineers missed out on the market of the E10 and totally ignored what their own consumer level digi cams were offering as well as the competition. 

The E20N is a large heavy camera that has solid professional feel. Those who like or need the traditional "click and slap" noise can use the built-in shutter/mirror sound effect, its gimmicky but is also available on the other Olympus cameras. 

When you take a snap shot the lense/viewfinder actually blacks for a moment giving the feel of a true 35mm film camera. Why bother guys, the idea is to go forward not backward in life. I think this is a silly waste but its there.

The E20N&#146s shows the exact image that is in  frame in the viewfinder.  The E20 doesn&#146t make use of a mirror in the unit rather it uses a functioning prism that will split the image between the viewfinder and the CCD image (memory card).

The E20's lens is a very large fixed mount 4X zoom, with  an 'ED' glass and two aspherical elements to help reduce chromatic malfunciotning. 

Since this lens is NOT interchangeable the CCD imager is never exposed to any natural elements such as dust, airborne contaminants, moisture or fingerprints. The F2.0 maximum aperture is ratehr fast and multi-blade diaphragm give a true depth of field control. 

Although the zoom's focal length is manually controlled like 35mm SLR zooms by turning a ring on the lens, the fact that it is NOT an interchangeable lens is why I don't feel that this is a true SLR camera. While you can add lenses such as a wide angle (at a cost of $179) you are somewhat limits in lens modifications. Unlike shall we say a Canon, or Nikon which has truly interchangebale lenses.

Some of the nicer features are:
 

White Balance 

Sharpeness: Hard, Normal or Soft 

Contrast: High, Normal or Low 

Interval Timer/ Time-lapse Mode: The camera will take pictures automatically (from 1 minute to 24 hours) until the batteries die or the memory card is full. 

Noise Reduction

Fast Focus

Two types of Storage Media (Smartmedia, and Compact Flash), Come on Olympus even your C-5050 has the new XD ability, what are you thinking?

The battery life is less than I would have expected, so always, YES ALWAYS have at lease one spare set, and you should look to purchase re-chargeable batteries. They are not inlcuded from Olympus with this unit. Also a downside!

Power: 2 CR-V3 lithium or 4 AA batteries "BUY RECAHRGABLES NIMH)

Storage Media: Dual Slot CF or SM (32mb SM card is included) You should look into buying a larger memory card. With 5megapixels the 32mb does not hold very many shots appx 16 at the high resolution.

Connectivity: Auto-Connect USB, easily recognized by most computer running Windows XP

Overall this is a nice camera, but when push comes to shove it just does not make the grade. Other camera are faster (Nikon, Minolta, Sony) The time this camera takes to store an image feels like forever. You may miss that one shot as a result, that you where looking to get if using it to capture wildlife.

In closing:

I would figure that with the price of this camera there would have, or should have been at least a 64mb or 128mb memory card, this is a 5megapixel unit!

Where are the proper batteries? 

The accessories for the camera (ie. the optional &#147Power Grip&#148 costs $600) are expensive to say the least.

The camera is pretty but bulky, and heavy. Also somewhat clumsy to use because it is slow to write, and recover to be ready for the next shot.

I could go on and on in writing but I feel that it is better said that you can do better in looking for an SLR digital camera. I hate to say it, because I am a loyal Olypmus user. I own the C-5050, owned the C-4040, and C-3030. I will let my dad keep this one!
