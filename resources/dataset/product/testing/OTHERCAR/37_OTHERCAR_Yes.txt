            I currently own a 1998 Isuzu Amigo and have approximately 15K miles on it. It has every option, except I wanted a 5-speed instead of an automatic. Of course, they came out with the hard top the year after I bought my Amigo. I have looked into buying a hardtop through the dealership and found that it would cost over $3000 to put one on my vehicle because all of the parts come separately.

I bought this vehicle because I needed four-wheel drive and I looked at all of the competitors and found the Amigo to be the best choice. One major reason was for the 205hp, V-6, DOHC motor that I love! This vehicle really does move when you want it to. I traded in a '97 Honda Accord SE that I felt was very sluggish on the interstates when it came to getting around large 18-wheelers.

I only have one big complaint about this vehicle. It is that there just is not enough room in the trunk area. I have a 3 year-old daughter and if I want to haul something I can't because the rear seat does not split. They do in the Rodeos, but not in the Amigo. She sits in a booster seat and if the rear seat did split, I could at least use one side of the space. Also, because she is so small, I can't place her in the front seat with the airbag, if I would want to completely put the rear seat down.

The Amigo to me, rides like a car. My husband has a Jeep Wrangler and there just is no comparison between the two, the Amigo is the best!
His jeep has a soft top too, but he gets plastic windows with zippers where I have power windows with heated power mirrors. I usually average around 20 mpg and that's great for a four-wheel drive. The soft top is quiet, not noisy and really doesn't bother me. I know that eventually it will probably have to be replaced, but that is years in the future. 

I would recommend this vehicle to someone either single or married without children. It is a two-door and the top easily removes when you want to feel the outside air, but I rarely take the top down because of my 3 year-old girl. It is a great vehicle and I have wanted an Amigo for years and I was very upset when they quit making them for a while. I have owned a lot of cars and the Amigo rates at the top, next to my '95 Talon AWD. It is great in the snow and fun in the summer with a cold a/c. I have the in-dash 6 disk CD player with an am/fm tape player and I love being able to easily switch my CD's. My vehicle also has side steps,(that came with it when I bought it) which makes it nice for people who have trouble climbing into an SUV. There have been a few recalls on my Amigo, which account for my trips to the shop, but I also had recalls on my Honda. All around the Amigo is worth investigating if you are looking for a fun, go anywhere, durable, gas friendly, but powerful mini-SUV with a lot of the options standard features.<br><br>
