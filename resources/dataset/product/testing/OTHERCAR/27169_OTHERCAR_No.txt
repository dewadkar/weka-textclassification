            Suffice it to say that this is not a shameless plug for Volkswagens.  We purchased our Passat GLS wagon new in '98 for  $25000.  We thought the price was steep at the time (at least twice what we had paid for any previous car).  We had been loyal Toyota drivers, but with two growing children, we needed a wagon.  Toyota had discontinued the Camry wagon a year before, and our family was committed to not participating in the cult of the minivan.  We happened to drive past a VW dealer and were impressed by the styling of the newly redesigned 1998 Passat.  Our purchase decision was further influenced by the promising report on the car given by Consumer Reports.  We were sold on the car after a test drive and the explanation of the "extensive" warranties on the car.    Our first two years were rather uneventful, with routine maintenance and a minor repair (one leather seat surface was found to have split open) covered under warranty.  I particularly enjoyed the way the car handled. It was simply fun to drive.  The only concern I had was a slight lurch I experienced when I would take my foot off the gas pedal.  Anyone who rode in the car could feel it, but the service departments at two dealerships mysteriously could never find the problem, even though the service manager at one dealer rode in the car and noticed the strange lurch himself.  

At the two year mark, our tribulations began:

1. By 25,000 miles, all four original Michelin tires had gone bald($500 to replace).

2. At 37,000 miles, the radiator core opened up, and had to be replaced twice(VW covered half the cost-$300).

3. At 53,000 miles, the lower control arms had to be replaced($1000, not covered by any warranty).  

4. At 53,000 miles, the MIL light came on, the diagnosis was that the Mass Airflow Sensor needed replacing. ($525, not covered by warranty)

5. Three weeks after replacing the sensor, the exhaust began blowing clouds of blue smoke at startup, and the MIL came back on.  The dealer said that the Turbo housing was cracked and leaking oil into the engine.  VW's power train warranty actually covered this.  We were disappointed, though, when the dealer admitted that he believed this probably caused the bad diagnostic code that caused the Mass Airflow Sensor to be replaced, but refused to refund our money for the sensor replacement.

6. At 70,000 miles, the ignition coil unit went bad. (Another $500, and again, not covered by any warranty)

7. At this point, the lurch is getting worse, but diagnostics do not find anything, and service technicians are at a loss as to how to fix the problem.


At this point, we are waiting for some assistance from VW's Customer Relations unit, but are not hopeful.  My repair costs over the last two years are over $2000, which is distressing for someone whose last car had about $1000 in repairs over 12 years.  

All in all, I would NOT buy another Volkswagen product again.
