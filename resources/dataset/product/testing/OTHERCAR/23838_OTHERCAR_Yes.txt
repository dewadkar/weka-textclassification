            Here's an update of my original opinion, now that I've owned this car for a while. Some good, some bad. 

I still love it. It's a comfortable drive and gets fabulous gas mileage. I also like that people say it looks just like the Prius (electric car)...I'm almost cutting edge!

However, it isn't holding up as well as I might have hoped. The cloth seats seem to be wearing quite fast. After only 4 months they look pretty old. Also, there seem to be some loose parts. I was driving about 80 the other day (yes, they really can go 80, even with two people in the car) and something started whistling. I think it was a loose part on the passenger side.

I do have to add that it is a lot more gutless when there is more than one person in the car. I don't have a problem going up big hills when I'm alone, but get 3 other passengers in the car and you'd better get in the slow lane.

Another annoying thing: not all oil change places have filters for this car. So I had to go to three places before I could get an oil change. 

I guess the bottom line is that this is still a great car, and excellent one person commuter car, but not the 100% dream car I though it was when I bought it.<br><br>
