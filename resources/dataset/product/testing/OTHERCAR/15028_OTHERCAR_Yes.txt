            Email me one of those magic pictures, my family says!  Just point, click and take that floppy to your hard drive, that's all there is to it.  This camera is easy to use.  There are 2 resolution choices, a feature to lighten or darken the subject as you are taking the picture, flash on/off, and picture effect options such as black and white and inversed.  Onscreen menu options exist for deleting and reviewing your pictures right on the view screen.  The weird thing about this camera is that it does not have a viewfinder, but has a view window.  The highest resolution on this camera is not that great, so if you are looking for photo quality pictures, this is not the camera for you.  However, a good photo editor can do wonders for the pictures.  I use this camera for putting product pictures up on the web and am very satisfied with it's performance!<br><br>
