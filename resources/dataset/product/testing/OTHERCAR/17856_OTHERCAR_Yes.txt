            I recently leased the 2000 two door Blazer and so far so good.  It's been three weeks and I have driven it successfully through snow, hail, rain and mud. The seats are very comfortable and it drives smoothly. 
I have been satisfied with the performance of the Blazer,yet there are a couple of downfalls such as, it is very difficult to see out of the rear window since the spare tire is attached to the back of the trunk.  When the head pieces of the back seats are pushed up, you can barely see at all.  I drive with the head pieces pushed down in order to see through the rearview mirror.  The back seat passengers complain that their heads have no support!  
A maximum height requirement is needed for the back seat since there is hardly any leg room and the people sitting there looked like sardines in a can.  I would recommend anyone over 6 feet tall ride shotgun!

Overall, the Blazer has been a very enjoyable ride!  I have received a lot of compliments from family and friends. I hope it stays that way.
