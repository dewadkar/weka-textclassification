            After driving my daily commuter, a 1993 Pontiac Grand Prix, for 2 years, I had enough with that troublemaker.  I gave it up to get a 1997 Nissan Altima.  It had only 20K miles on it and even smelled new.  I needed a dependable car and while I had my Saab Funster on the weekend, I needed a reliable car to somberly take me to work.

The Nissan Altima was a replacement to the Nissan Stanza back in 1993 and it was much improved over it's predessor.  It has the engine of the 240SX, which is a 2.4L Inline 4 that pumps out 150hp.  It is a fairly strong engine that propels the car, but it is buzzy and unrefined.  A few steps back of the Toyota Camry 2.2L In-4.  

This leads to a ride that is not as quiet as the competition.  However, the handling is decent on it's stock tires and the suspension can swallow even large bumps with aplomb.

The brakes are strong, but they have begun squealing when lightly pressed.  What I've been told is that they require shims to quiet them down, but are not worn out, so I won't hold it against the car...yet.

The interior is fairly fresh and well designed ergonomically.  I even like the stripe of fake wood on the dash.  The radio and A/C are well placed and easy to understand.

The interior is smaller than the competition, namely the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, however it feels a touch larger than my previous 1996 Ford Contour.  The rear seating fits 4, but it is tight for 5.  The trunk is spacious for a car this size.  The car has a ski passthrough, but lacks folding seats. 

Overall, I like the car more for city driving than for long highway jaunts.  The noise level is higher than average and the seats are not as supportive as it should be.  However, as long as the car remains reliable, I will be a happy camper.  According to the reviews and the reviews from respectable publications such as Consumer Reports and Consumer Digest, the car is reliable....Rating: B-<br><br>
