            I bought my Mercury Mystique used.  It was a '95 and had about 20,000 miles on it.  I bought it in February of '97.I had a Ford Tempo before this and I know many people out there don't like Fords.  I had good luck with mine so I decided to go with something similar.  I have put 75,000 miles on this car myself along with the 20,000 when I first bought it and I have had only ONE problem.  Granted, it was a big one, but nonetheless, only one.  It was my head gasket.  I guess Ford's &amp; Mercury's make them out of aluminum type of material and not steel.  I'm one to always get an extended warranty so I was pretty lucky in terms of not having to pay for the repair.  I have never been stranded with the car, not even a flat tire.  This is extremely important being that I do a lot of driving in my job.  (And I'm from Minnesota!)  I think that it's really important to get oil changes on time and transmission fluid changes when they are due too.  I believe this keeps car repairs down.  I love my extras in this car as well like cruise, air, cassette player, drink holders, power doors and power windows.  It's a bigger car, but personally I feel safer in bigger cars.  I don't know much about crash tests with this car, but I haven't heard that they are bad.<br><br>
