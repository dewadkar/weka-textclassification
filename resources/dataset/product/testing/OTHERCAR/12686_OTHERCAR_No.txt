            I bought this vehicle NEW back in 1997 because I needed something a little bigger then my Saturn SC2, and this car was a little bigger and a little more expensive.  Looking back at it it was the BIGGEST mistake of my life.

There was not much I liked about the car.  I mainly bought it on a recommendation, from a friend who had one, and I though they looked cool and I got it for an OK price.  The car did have some back seat room, and that was what I needed.  I found the trunk to be too small, and the acceleration was terrible.  I believe the car only has 120 horse power, and it pulls out like a snail.  Not to mention how LOUD the car is.  If you are going to buy one of these get the Z24 AT LEAST.  It did drive ok, when it ran like it was supposed to.  Also the dash looked cheap and didn't look, sound, or feel like it was made very well.

Now Little would I know that Chevrolet was gonna FLOOD the market with these bad boys, and that their resale value would be ZILCH!  Thats right folks, Chevy made so many of these little beauties that they do not resell for bubkiss.  Look at your local used car lot and you will find a TON of this model from all different years, although they all still look pretty much the same, it is hard to tell a 97 from a 98 and a 99 and so on.  So now that we have the few things I like out of the way, it is time to talk about my dislikes.  First off the SECOND day I had it I was driving in the rain and my wipers STOPPED working.  Now this wasn't a little sprinkle, this was a downpour!  I had to pull over and wait for the rain to calm down, then drive it to the dealership for REPAIR ON MY 2 DAY OLD CAR!   Then the car ALWAYS had this ANNOYING squeaking in the dash that NEVER went away... EVER. It would Always, Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak. UGH! It drove me nuts!  Another problem was many of these cars had the rear windows mounted incorrectly causing them to SHATTER!  No kidding my rear window shattered one day.  That was a lot of fun.  Then on a trip to Ohio, with my car at 37,000 miles the key cylinder broke and I couldn't even START the car.  I had to have a tow truck come and tow it to be repaired and TRAP me in Ohio for an extra 3 days.  Then they wanted me to pay for it, cause it was out of warranty, but when I had the service manager at the dealership look up my service history, he sent me home with no bill at all.  Thats right, he felt so bad for me he didn't bill me for the repair.  

Now I am leaving some of the minor problems out, but thats the Major ones for you.  It was and I know the new owner, it IS STILL a troublesome car, I told her that when I sold it to her, and I have lost ALL faith in in Chevrolet after this experience.  I have talked to many other friends who have these cars and they too have had bad experiences with them.  I dont know if it is just the 1997 models or what.  I would/will NEVER buy another Cavalier again, and may never buy another Chevrolet for that matter.

I hope you have enjoyed my epinion, if you have any questions PLEASE email me and be sure to leave your comments.<br><br>
