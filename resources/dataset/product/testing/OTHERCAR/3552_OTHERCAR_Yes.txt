            The HP 315 is the best 2.1 mega pixel for your money. At $300 it is a steal. The setup was a breeze. The software install was great. Overall it took about 18 minutes from opening the box to importing photos from the device into my computer. 

The good: 
Very easy menu. The one touch button to change from basic - fine - super fine mode, is great. The thumbnail view on the view screen, makes it easy to navigate to a selected picture. Sliding front door to protect the lens. 

The bad:
No AC adapter. The screen to view the images is exposed. Battery life. The digital zoom is almost worthless.

The pictures:
In basic mode, the photos are in 640 X 480. The quality is acceptable, especially if you are sending many in attached e-mails. The quality is pretty good and it interprets the colors very well. In Fine mode, the photos make a big step up. I took my first photo at night, right outside the Best Buy and the picture was surprisingly clear. Considering there was not much light in the parking lot, I was expecting a grainy shot. Instead it was a clear, deep in color, very well illuminated shot. Considering I was about 500 feet away, the flash really provided a tremendous amount of light. I was very impressed with the camera's ability to take pictures in the dark. The super fine is outstanding. The pictures are crystal clear. I have an HP 932 printer and using glossy paper, the printouts look like photographs. 

Overall, I would recommend it to anyone. For $300 I don't think you can get a better machine.
