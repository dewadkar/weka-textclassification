            To tell you the truth, I would have never bought the X5, had it not been for my son's constant pestering for me to at least give it a test drive.  Frankly, I thought it was ugly like the Mercedes ML320, and I had no desire to drive it.

But all that changed.

After giving the BMW a thorough test drive, I was hooked on the X5 - so hooked in fact, that I bought one on the very same day, in shiny jet black, at about $50K.

What made me so hooked on the car?

There are so many reasons.  First, the power.  Although I did not test drive nor buy the 4.4 Liter V8 model, I find the 3.0 inline 6 to be plenty powerful, with 225 horsepower and gobs of torque on hand.  The X5 has more than adequate highway passing power, and it never struggles when climbing up hills. Handling in the X5 is comparable to luxury sedans, and I felt only slight body lean in sharp corners, unlike most SUV's. Making the driving experience even more enjoyable is the smooth shifting 5 speed Steptronic transmission, which has 3 interesting modes.  The first mode is the regular automatic mode, which works like any standard automatic transmission.  The second mode, known as &quot;Sport,&quot; allows the engine to rev at higher RPMs faster, great for when you need a quick surge of power.  The third mode is the semi-manual mode, which allows you to shift through all five gears manually.  And who can forget that the X5 has all wheel drive?  The power is split roughly at 38%front/62%rear.  With this car I can feel confident braving rainstorms or snow-plowed roads, where 2wd vehicles would never dare to tread.

In addition to the refined engine and smooth transmission is the inviting luxurious interior.  Beautiful Poplar wood abounds, with acres of Montana leather upholstery, and classy brushed aluminum-like door handles.  The leather-wrapped steering wheel is just perfect - fat and grippy, and all the controls are nicely within the driver's reach.

Complaints? Well, for one thing, the split tailgate design is just plain unintuitive - a conventional single piece design would have been much more useful.  In addition, the bottom piece of the split tailgate does not use gas shocks, but instead implements some rather cheap plastic folding arms that seem very cheaply assembled.  Also, I would advise you to test drive an X5 with the sport package if you intend to purchase it as an option.  Although the stiffer shocks included in the package improve handling, the ride gets rather harsh, most noticeably on roads with a lot of potholes.  Furthermore, another complaint I have is the price of the X5.  If you want a reasonably equipped 3.0i X5, it's going to set you back about $46K.  You could go for the base model, which prices around $38.9K, but standard features are few - leather is not even included as standard.  Add a CD changer, sport package, leather, sport seats, moonroof, etc., and you'll see how quickly the price can jump.

Oh yeah, one more thing - don't expect this so called &quot;SAV&quot; (sports activity vehicle) to do any serious off-roading; with no transfer case and all wheel drive, combined with a rather small ground clearance, the X5 is better fit to drive in extreme weather conditions, rather than climbing cliffs.  Also, the &quot;Hill Descent Control&quot; feature, which, when engaged, automatically applies the brakes to the individual wheels when necessary to inch the X5 down a hill at about 5 MPH, is useless.  I tried the feature once going down a dirt hill, and it left my X5's brakes smoking.

Bottom line - The BMW X5 combines the best of both worlds, with sedan-like handling and SUV versatility.<br><br>
