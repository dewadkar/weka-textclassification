            I found this to be the best car for the price out of the Focus (a close second, but not as reliable), Corolla, and Civic.

I have just passed the 1000 mile break-in period, and the car is so fun to
drive that I have had to use a lot of restraint to keep the RPMs
below the recommended 4000 during the break-in.  Peak torque comes on around 4800.

I opted for the SE 5-speed with the performance package.  This gave
me the 16 inch rims and some suspension upgrades, which makes the
car stiff, but not overly jarring.  Hard bumps are felt, but they
are not annoying.

What is annoying is the engine buzz below 3000 RPM.  It is felt in
the steering wheel and the shifter.  It also effects any plastic pieces
that are joined by fasteners, as they have begun to sing in harmony with
the engine; rattling like crazy. Other drivers are planning on taking their Sentras in to have them buckled down as needed, and I will do the same.  I have to wonder how many things may work themselves loose as a side effect of this vibration.  

The stock Firestone tires limit this car severely.  They are terrible
on any surface besides dry pavement.

The Sentra is incredibly stable at speed.  Heavy crosswinds have little effect on this car, even at eighty miles per hour.

I am 6'1&quot; and can drive comfortably, although with me in the front seat,
only a child would fit in the back.  Believe the reviewers when they say
that the back seat has limited leg room.

The stereo/CD is excellent, but upgraded speakers will be installed eventually.  The heat and air work very well.

Someone else commented on the boring colors, and I concur.  None of
them are remotely exciting.  I went with the Out Of The Blue.  It has
grown on me, but it's not inspiring.

Overall, a great, small car.  If the engine vibration could be dampened, Iï¿½d give it a 10.
