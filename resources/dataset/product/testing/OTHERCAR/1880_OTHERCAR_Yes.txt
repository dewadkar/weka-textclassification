            Before I came to own my 92 Grand Am I never really paid much attention to them. One day I came to a car dealership and seen the Grand Am. It was sporty and sharp looking. I seen the price on the windshield and I immediately wanted the car. The white paint scheme gave it a nice shiny new look to it and both the interior and exterior were flawless. 
 The car had only one previous owner and only 98,000 miles on it. The one feature that really drew me to the car was the automatic gear shift in between the seats, I had always wanted to own a car with one. I had no problems with driving the car, it ran smooth and there were no mechanical problems with the engine. The car ran great for about 2 1/2 months until one day the car overheated and the radiator cracked. It was only a minor setback and within a day I had a new radiator in the car and was set to go. 
 Up until now I experienced no problems with the car until it began to stall on me on my way to work. I soon discovered that the fuel pump needed replaced and at the same time I began experiencing overheating problems again. I am currently working on getting the car fixed. Until then I will still drive the car.
