            I purchased the a beautiful golden 2000 Honda Accord in 1999. I chose this vehicle because of Honda's excellent reputation for reliability, good gas mileage, and safety. The Honda Accord LX is also the first Honda ULEV vehicle in production. ULEV is Ultra Low Emission Vehicle. The car runs very smoothly and quietly. All the driver controls are well placed and within easy reach of the driver's seat. This car accelerates very rapidly. One neat feature is that the back seat folds down which gives easy access to the trunk. I have slept several nights laying down in the trunk and the on the back of the back seat. This is more comfortable than sleeping on one of the front seats. Oil needs to be changed every 7500 miles, which is a great improvement over the older vehicles. This is a great family car, although it can be made to look a bit sportier by adding a spoiler on the back. The antenna is built into the rear window. You will not have antenna problems. The reception is much better than a standard metal antenna. Above the mirror, you will find a built in sunglass holder that drops down. What luxury!

I highly recommend this car.<br><br>
