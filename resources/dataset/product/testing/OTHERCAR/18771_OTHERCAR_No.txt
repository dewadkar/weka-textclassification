            <b>Summary:</b> The 1997 Kia is a cheap car: I bought mine for only $5500.  But when you buy something on the cheap, you get product that's cheap, too: a flimsy, low-performance, high-maintenance vehicle.

<b>Inexpensive, OK Mileage</b>
The Kia is a really cheap car.  My 1997 Kia cost only $5500 when I bought it last year with just 35,000 miles on it and one year left on the warranty.  Just try to buy a 1997 Honda with the same miles for the same price - you'll be laughed out of the showroom.

The Kia's Mileage is also OK.  I drive mine in town, and it flirts with 30 miles per gallon, which is pretty good.  Kia boasts that the Sephia does even better out of town, but...well, we'll get to that in a bit.

If I really think about it, I've gotta admit there's a certain pride that comes with owning a Kia.  It's kind of a statement to live frugally by driving a cheap car.  And as a second car for tooting around in-town, it's not a bad choice.  Do you really need one of those SUVs that is built like a tank to go pick up a gallon of milk?  The worst that can happen, I suppose, is that I'll break down on the road and have to walk a quarter of a mile to the nearest pay phone so I can call a tow truck.

Notice that the highest praise I can offer is that hey, I can always call a tow truck!  That's not a really ringing endorsement.

<b>Cheap is, Unfortunately, Cheap</b>
So what keeps me from singing the praises of my Kia?  Let me count the offenses.  I can feel and hear tinny little clicks, abrasive grinds, nervous shudders and odd groans every time I shift gears.  The gas cap leaks fumes, and the tank has some weak spots (the repair shop said - reassuringly? - that they saw this kind of thing all the time with Kias).  The starter is irregular; sometimes the car just won't start.  The car won't handle fast corners.  As for fast straightaways, forget it - the Sephia strains to get above 55 mph.  The parking brake won't release fully unless I push it down.  The little rubber strips that line the passenger doors are starting to come off.  A bit of wind comes in because the windows won't shut all the way.  The key doesn't work too well with the door locks.  All on a car driven 35,000 miles.

I take the car into the dealer to work on one of these problems, and after I drive home another problem pops up.  I could view this in a positive light: I'm making some regular friends at the dealer.  But when I'm trying to get things done, keeping up with the Kia's maintenance demands can be a real pain.

<b>In Sum...</b>
In sum, this cheap car is cheaply made and runs cheaply, too.  I'm not sure it's going to last too much longer.  I certainly am not confident enough about its performance to take it out for extended drives through depopulated areas.  It takes many more years for a Honda or a Saab or Toyota to break down this much; if I had to do it over again, I just might go with one of those models instead.  Sure, I'd pay more upfront, but I'd also be more likely to still have a working car by the time I finished paying the car loan.  

In other words, unless you really don't care about quality, versatility and reliability, this is not the car for you.
