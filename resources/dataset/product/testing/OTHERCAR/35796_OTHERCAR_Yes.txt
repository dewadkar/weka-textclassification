            My husband and I bought our 1994 Saturn SL1 in January of 1994 with only 3 miles on the odometer.  Six years later and 112,000 more miles and our Saturn is still going strong.  

The Saturn dealership sold us on the car with their no haggle pricing and no hassle return policy if after 30 days we didn't want it we could return it for a full refund.  Saturn was also the first dealership that didn't try to push a more expensive vehicle on us.  We knew what we could afford and Saturn sold us the car we wanted.  

When we first test drove the car, we were impressed with the comfort and standard options which the car included.  A similarly equipped Honda would have cost us much more.

Our Saturn has several features which I really like.  First, it has back seats which fold down to allow easy access to the trunk.  This is especially nice when you need extra cargo space for hauling a Christmas tree, or ladder or some other lengthy object.  Another nice feature is the automatic shoulder belts which move into place when you start the car &amp; close the door.  For a mid-size sedan, the SL1 has a lot of leg room in the front seats (it can be a little cramped in the back).

On the downside, the SL1 has only a 4 cylinder engine so it could use some more horsepower.  It is also difficult to find tires for this car because they are not a standard size so they tend to be more expensive to replace.  When in need of replacement parts it's difficult to find parts at auto supply stores so you have to buy them from the dealership which can be expensive.  Some repairs must be done at the dealership because certain tools are needed to fix them and not all repair shops have the equipment to fix a Saturn.  When we took our car to Precision Tune to have the belts replaced they advised us to go to Saturn because they didn't have the tool needed to replace the serpentine belt.  

The SL1 is a smooth ride.  The controls are easy to reach and operate.  The seat and steering wheel can be adjusted for comfort.  It's a good car and very reliable.  

This is a great car for anybody.  My Grandmother has an SL1 and so does my Mother so it's a car for all generations.  It's great for college kids because it's low maintenance and gets great gas mileage.  It's a good solid car for the price.  It has many features of more expensive cars but it's very affordable for almost anybody.
