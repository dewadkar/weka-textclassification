            The car is excellent, comfortable, drives well.  

But there is one thing people don't check when buying a vehicle; how fast can parts be obtained when a break down occurs or when you have had an accident?

It happened to me, my wife had an accident December 30/99, the car was in the shop January 4/00, to this date, March 23/00 the car is still in the body shop because they haven't been able to get all the parts.  The final parts needed are promised to arrive the first week in April.  We have been paying lease payments without been able to drive the car.  The car is driveable now and Subaru is telling me to pick up the car and return it when the final parts arrive.  I want a completed car. 

I also found out that some body shops do not like to fix Subarus because of the horrendous logistics in acquiring parts.  Even the parts manager at the dealership states that Subaru is the worst.  Their own warehouses do not communicate, between themselves, as to the available inventory.

This is the first and last Subaru for me and my family, once the lease is over, no more; and last but not least, when you call Subaru customer service expect to wait anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes and more.

My advice don't buy a Subaru until they fix their internal parts problems.<br><br>
