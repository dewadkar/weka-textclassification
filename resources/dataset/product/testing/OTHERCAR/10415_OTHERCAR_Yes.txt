            I drove my 1989 Suburban for 11 years until it got wrecked.  I wasn't prepared to buy another car, mentally or financially, and I assumed it would take me many weeks of kicking tires before finding another car -- smaller this time, since in another year, only 1 of my 5 kids will still be at home.  My only criteria for a vehicle was 4 doors, comfort and luxury, and no more than 2 years old. My 18-year-old also needed a good used car for school.

Going to the &quot;big city&quot; for my first day of looking, I entered the parking lot of the first car dealership I came to, primarily to look for a car for my daughter.  I ended up test-driving the first car I looked at, at that first dealership, and bought it that day.  Thought I would have buyer's remorse, since it was the first car I had ever picked out and paid for myself, but I have loved that car more every time I get in it.

It is a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited with power everything.  It has a six-cylinder engine, gets between 16-20 miles per gallon (once I got 21.5 on a long trip) and has leather seats and a power moonroof.  

Here are the things I like about it most:
1.  Radio and stereo control buttons on the back of the steering wheel.  I use these every time I drive the car and they delight me every time.
2.  Heated leather seats--love the comfort, love the warmth, and on my very short trip to work, they get me warm before the heater even has a chance to warm up.
3.  Color is amethyst, a very dark purple that sparkles in the sunlight and looks dark-purple almost black at night. To make it unique, I had tiny purple and blue pinstriped lines painted on it.  It causes some comment, and makes it truly mine.
4.  Computerized overhead console.  Tells me average gas mileage (absolutely accurate to the 1/10 of a mile), direction, temperature, current miles per gallon and distance to empty at the press of a button.
5.  Rear lift gate with opening back glass.  This is very efficient for groceries and packages.  I use either one or both, depending on the cargo.
6.  Folding seats.  Though much smaller than my old Suburban, with the seats folded down I can get almost anything in the Jeep, and not have to worry about damaging the leather.
7.  Full-time four wheel drive--this is GREAT for ME--I don't have to worry about when to put the car in 4-wheel drive when the weather is bad, and the handling seems exceptional to me.
8.  I enjoy getting in this car every day.  I love the way it smells, drives, looks, feels and the luxury of power everything and a great stereo.

With a six cylinder engine, it is probably a little under-powered, but I bought the car used and I would have taken a V-8 if available, but I don't mind the six.  It cruises at highway speeds with no problem and I don't need to squeal the wheels often anyway.

I find the handling much better than the Suburban though maybe a little rougher than a sedan, but certainly very acceptable.

I had lighted running boards installed, both for appearance and so I could reach all the way to the middle of the windshield.  Also a rear spoiler to keep the back window cleaner. The rear windshield wiper, heated rear window and mirrors and automatic dimming rear view mirror are great, and add to both efficiency and enjoyment.

Mechanically, the car functions perfectly.  I bought the car with 34,000 miles on it and it had a leak in the rear axle boot, which the dealer repaired under warranty.  I have driven the car 10,000 miles and it has functioned perfectly.  There are no squeaks or rattles, and it is fairly quiet.  Visibility is very good, and the 10-way power memory seats with lumbar support are very comfortable.

Though the luxury items mentioned are available on many cars, it is the combination of luxury and Jeep that make me so happy, and the mechanical reliability has been a plus.  I bought the car at an absolute rock-bottom price as well, in fact, now seven months since purchase, I haven't seen one near the price. To me, it is the perfect combination of luxury and size, useability and efficiency, and it makes me happy every day!  <br><br>
