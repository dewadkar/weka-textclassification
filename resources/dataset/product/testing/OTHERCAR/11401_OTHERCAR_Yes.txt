            My mother bought a 4Runner this year.  Bad timing with the gas prices going through the roof and staying there all year, but she likes to be able to ride high and she has always wanted a 4Runner.  I am a 4Runner fan myself and love the ability to take the 4Runner up to the ski slopes with no worries.

The 4Runner is an expensive vehicle.  I believe my parents got theirs for $33,000, of course they the 4Runner with V6 and all the bells and whistles.  I am not sure how much horsepower it has, but I do not think that it matches the Pathfinder's 240 hp, which is unfortunate.  Driving such a vehicle so big and bulky, it is key to have the power to handle the mountains and be able to zoom down the freeways.

The interior is comfortable, I would say that it is luxurious.  Cupholders, cd player, stereo system, fabric interior.  I think Jeep's with the leather seats are more comfortable, but I have never met anyone who loved their Jeep so I would not go that route.  The Pathfinder may be comfortable, I have not been in the new ones to know.

As far as handling, the 4Runner is good for an SUV.  It is big, but I think Toyota has tried to improve handling and the 4Runner can handle corners and turns just fine just as long as you do not try to drive it like a Ferrari.

This is a nice vehicle.  I do not think it will disappoint you.<br><br>
