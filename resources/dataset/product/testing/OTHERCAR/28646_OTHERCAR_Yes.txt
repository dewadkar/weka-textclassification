            I brought my DC200 on clearance at Staples for $199 about 1 year ago.  It has been a serviceable little camera and the price I paid kept me away from upgrade temptations since even the current DC210/215 models are still running $100 more.

The only real drawback to this model is the lack of a zoom.  I find the field of view of the lens too wide for most purposes and I think the newer models offering zoom lenses should really be considered.  When displayed at 4x6 or 5x7 size the prints look sharp and the colors bright.  Strong daylight seems to give the best images whereas indoor with the flash produces relatively dark pictures.

If you wish to buy one of these you won't be disappointed if your primary use is web posting.  Printing pictures has a host of other issues and frankly another topic.  I'll just say that the prints look good at 4x6 but get grainy at 5x7.

I strongly recommend that whatever camera you buy you get a spare memory card and a flash card reader.  The serial transfer from this camera is painfully slow and having a little memory card reader speeds things up tremendously.  One feature I do like is the ability to output a signal directly to a TV.  My mother in law gets a blast out of the instant display of her grand kids this offers.

Like most digital camera it eats batteries.  However this is mostly an issue of running the built in screen which will drain the batteries in 20 minutes or so.  If you keep this off you can easily get over 100 pictures on one set of alkaline batteries.  Rechargeables seem to drain faster but that is a rather subjective opinion.  I find that the used batteries that can no longer power the camera still have plenty of juice to run a walkman, flashligh, radio or MP3 player for several hours so don't just throw them away.

Pictures tend to be a little dark but nothing that can't be fixed up with any basic software package.

As with most things this unit is outdated now, but if you can pick one up on clearance or used I think you'll be happy.<br><br>
