            The Olympus Brio D-150 is one of the most feature packed 1.3 megapixel digital cameras in its price class.  I paid $149 at Costco, which is a great price considering its features.  Earlier, I paid $99 for a HP Photosmart C215 which was horrible, even if it was such a good price -- I ended up returning it.  Back to the Olympus Brio D-150...  The Olympus is <i>light years</i> ahead of the HP I tried.  It was big, had a clunky interface and its circuitry couldn't handle rechargable batteries!  That's insane since digital cameras drain batteries so quickly.

Key features:
-<b>OPTICAL</b> zoom -- it has a 3x <b>optical</b> zoom and a 2x digital zoom.  The <b>optical</b> zoom is much better, because it does not affect the quality of the picture.  The camera is physically zooming in on the subject.  It gets closer than my 35-105mm zoom camera!  There is also a 2x digital zoom, which is also good.  It affects the quality of the picture somewhat, but not too much.  With both <b>optical</b> and digital zoom utilized, you effectively get 6x closer to your subject.  It worked GREAT on a trip I was on.  I got so much closer to things I was taking pictures of that I took more pictures with my nifty new Olympus digital camera.

-<b>PRICE</b> -- For $149, this camera is a bargain.  Olympus is <i>the</i> brand to get when shopping for a camera.  They are built really solid and are reliable.  I still can't believe what an incredible deal this was.  It just has so many features when compared to other cameras in this price class.

-<b>FEATURES</b> -- Other than the optical AND digital zoom, another important feature is the <b>macro mode</b>.  I looked at quite a few digital cameras, and most of them didn't have an optical zoom or macro mode.  Macro mode is great for those really close-up shots.  It's great for eBay auctions or similar when you want a close up picture of your item.  This camera features 8mb of <b>SmartMedia</b>, which is easily upgradable.  There is a small slot where you stick the <b>SmartMedia</b> in, which is very convenient.  I purchased an additional 32mb card, for $20.  It's a great investment because 8mb is certainly not enough.  It will only allow you to take 8 super high quality pictures, 24 high quality pictures or 90 something standard quality.  I leave the setting at high quality, because the pictures come out clear enough and save space so you can take much more pictures.  With my new 32mb card, I can take 99 high quality pictures.

-<b>BATTERY LIFE</b> -- Battery life is excellent.  I use rechargable Ni-Mh batteries with my camera (much more economical than single use batteries).  They lasted 80 pictures, about 50 of them framed with the LCD (which uses a lot of battery power), and about 5 minutes of reviewing pictures.  That is <i>excellent</i> compared to most other cameras.  This is a major plus and an important thing to consider when selecting a digital camera.

-<b>PICTURE QUALITY</b> -- Picture quality is decent, but could be sharper.  I rarely print pictures, so this is good enough.  I mainly use it for emailing pictures and for eBay.  If you would like a sample picture, you can email me.  The pictures seem a bit "noisy"...  It isn't as sharp as other cameras, but for $149 you can't really grumble.

<b>CONNECTIVITY</b> -- I use WindowsXP, so when I connect the camera (it's via USB), the camera shows up as a removeable drive.  I simply double click the the removeable drive which is the camera files, and I'm quickly viewing the pictures.  NO drivers to install, which makes everything so much easier.  I had tons of problems with other camera drivers, and this feature alone is worth getting the camera.  It saves you all the headaches.


All in all, I'd say this is one excellent camera.  The menus are easy to understand, and you don't need to read the manual for <i>everything</i>.  Just a few things here and there.  For $149, it has all the features you could want and more.  It has an impressive zoom matched with impressive battery life.  NOTE: The camera comes with a lithium battery, but I would <b>highly</b> recommend getting rechargable batteries.  The lithium battery is single use.
