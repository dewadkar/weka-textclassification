            My wife and I have a 22 month old daughter and haven't purchased a car since she was born. With the lease on our Saturn expiring soon, we decided that the next car we bought would require MORE ROOM! We considered the Saturn LW200 wagon, the Dodge Caravan, the Honda Odyssey and the Mazda MPV. After a lot of online research and extensive test driving, we settled on the 2000 MPV LX and couldn't have been happier with our decision.

Loaded with standard features like CD player, ABS, cruise control, power windows, power locks, power heated side mirrors, hideaway third seat, Mazda's &quot;Side by Slide&quot; bucket/bench second row, and lots of storage, we still felt the need to upgrade to the Four Seasons package and the Touring Package. The Four Seasons package added a heavy duty battery, heavy duty rear defogger, larger windshield washer tank (hurrah!), larger radiator and rear heater controls, not much of a luxury during Michigan winters! The Touring Package added side air bags, keyless remote entry with anti-theft system, nine speaker sound system, 16&quot; alloy wheels, mega floor mats and other amenities.

The clincher was the price: $21,400 plus tax and title! Deduct the $400 Mazda Graduate Program incentive rebate (good for college students graduating in the next 6 months or last 2 years OR those currently enrolled in graduate school, as is my wife) and you've got a top-of-the-line van for a lot less than the Odyssey and the Caravan and with more room than the Saturn wagon.

We love the seat configuration and the flexibility it allows. We can take a trip to see relatives with only three bucket seats and lots of storage for luggage, then once we're unpacked, pop up the third seat for room for six. Awesome! The driver's seat, though manual, can adjust to suit just about anyone - I'm 6'2&quot;, 275 and am VERY comfortable in any of the seats in the MPV.

Granted, the engine is a bit &quot;weedy&quot; and there is some road noise, coming from a four cylinder Saturn, we have barely noticed either and don't consider them liabilities. Highway driving is smooth and handling is superb with less top roll than the bigger minivans. 

This is a great vehicle for new parents making the jump from sedans and coupes to the dreaded &quot;mommy-mobiles.&quot; Lots of room, yet easy to handle and maneuver through shopping center parking lots. All the extras you're used to and some very nice exterior styling.

Let Odyssey and Caravan hog the spotlight. I'll just quietly revel in the knowledge that I got a great deal on what might be the best minivan on the market.<br><br>
