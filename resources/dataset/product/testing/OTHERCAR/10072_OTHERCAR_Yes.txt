            I am a 30 year old female, and I have never liked SUV's.  Never had any desire to purchase one.  I had my heart set on a 2001 Grand Am, test drove it, and hated it (love my '97).  So, after sitting around depressed about not liking the car I thought I would love, my husband talked my into test driving a Honda Passport.  I loved it, but did not want to spend 30 thousand dollars.  I was driving to work one day and saw this incredible looking bright yellow machine headed toward me.  As soon as I caught the first glimpse, I new I had to have one.  Once at work, I called the local Nissan Dealer to check on the prices (don't tell the boss).  Then when I got home that night I started checking out all the internet info about the Xterra.  I found a great deal on an XE at the local dealer.  He let me bring it home and drive it for the weekend.  It had nice power getting on and off the highway ramps.  I drive over some big hills to work every day, and it had no problems there either.  With two teenage step sons, the stadium style rear seats are great.  They can see right over my head and don't have to hug the back of my seat and yell in my ear. There is also plenty of rear leg room.  We love to go boating and skiing, and the Xterra hauls the boat just fine.  There is also ample room in the back for the skis, knee boards, and wake boards.  We've already been in the lake once this year, and the Xterra had no problem launching the boat, nor pulling it back out at the end of the day.  All the dash gizmos are conveniently located and easy to reach.  I have not had to use the 4 wheel drive, but I expect to this winter. The hills I travel can get hairy in the winter.  The ride was smooth and the road noise was minimal.  Fast turns are tough for me yet, as I am used to driving a car, there is a definite difference in turning.  You do have that leaning feeling if you take a turn too fast, that you don't have with a car.  I will just have to adjust my driving style a bit.  All in all, this is an excellent vehicle.  It looks great, handles well, turns heads, and has decent gas mileage for an SUV (although I am used to much better mileage with a car).
