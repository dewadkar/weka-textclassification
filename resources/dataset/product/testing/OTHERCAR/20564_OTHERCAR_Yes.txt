            The 1999 Acura Integra Coupe has everything needed for a sports car lover.  Despite not having the biggest engine, or sportiest design, it soars over the competitors.  Not only does it surpass the competitors in style, looks, and performance, but in price as well.  The affordable Acura Integra comes complete with a nice cd player and terrific Infiniti sound system.  Also the Integra has a sporty look with a rear spoiler attached to the back.  Even though the price is terrific, there are even better qualities.  The Acura Integra is one of the most durable cars I have ever seen.  People have been driving them for five to eight years and never changed.  The other impressive fact is the safety.  Looking at damaged cars done in tests, the Acura Integra came out with one of the best responses.  When looking for a new car, the Acura Integra's sleak design, safety, and perfomance, add up to be on the top of my list.  Being one of the best buys for the money, I would recomend this car to anyone who wants a nice sporty and affordable car.<br><br>
