            After driving around a clunker junker for a few years, I decided to treat myself to a new car/truck prior to my high school graduation.  After looking around at all the dealers, makes, and models, I came across an 
S-10 pickup that stood out the second I saw it.  Even though I couldn't drive this truck for it was a stick shift and I never happened to learn, I had the sales guy drive it around so I could get a feel for it.  As I left the lot in awe, I could tell that this was the one. Days after, I decided to test drive a few other trucks such as the Ford Ranger and Toyota Tacoma, I realized that they were out of my price range with a MSRP over 20,000.  So,  I stuck with my hunch and went with the 1999 S-10 EXT(SS) and so far I am highly satisfied with my choice.  I have taken it on a few road trips, but mostly use it back and forth to school and work.  It gets about 20 MPG around town, and about 28 on the Highway.  However, I have had a few problems with sudden jerks at high acceleration shifts, as well as the stick rattling at about 2500.  I have talked to a few other people who own an S-10 and they agree that those are a few of the drawbacks to the truck.<br><br>
