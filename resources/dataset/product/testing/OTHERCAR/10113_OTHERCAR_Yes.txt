              I own a 1996 Mercury Sable, and although I love almost everything about this car, I have ran into another irritating and potentially costly defect.  The automatic door locks on my car have caused problems since the car had approximately 30,000 miles on it.  I have had 2 &quot;Door Ajar&quot; switches replaced in the last 13 months. Both have been on the front passenger side door.  One of them lasted 12 months 10 days and it was warranted for 12 months.  It cost me $27.00 to get it replaced again. Now the drivers side rear door lock is making a horrible noise. This door hasn't been used very much so I can't understand why it is causing problems.  Maybe Ford needs to look at the design of these doors, and fix some of these irritating defects. These type of things give me a low opinion of Ford craftsmanship. Still, overall, I enjoy this car and hopefully won't have cause to regret buying it. <br><br>
