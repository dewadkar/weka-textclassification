            <b>***Edited June 19,2001</b> Please see at bottom of epinion.
As I write this, I'm halfway to Myrtle Beach, SC in my NEW <b>2000 Dodge Caravan</b>. Purchased with 8 miles on it 3 days ago from <b>Lake Norman Dodge </b>. So far it is great!! We decided to go with a dark color this time, so <i>Patriot Blue with gray interior</i>,was just what I wanted. Our van did come with a few standard things, such as captain seats in the front. We did chose to go with the bench seat in the middle. Although I would have loved to had the captain seats there too, there was a large markup in the price we were willing to pay. One feature I was dead set on , was the <i>double sliding doors</i>. This is a <b>MUST</b> if you have children. Which I do :-)  No more fighting over who gets the door seat. 

We decided to break one of our set rules and went with a few extras. Such as....
<i>V6-3.0 liter engine It has great pickup. Good for highway driving. Gotta watch myself in the city :-)
Power Windows and Locks
Double sliding doors
Tilt Steering
Tinted Windows</i>

I have found a few other features in my <b> Dodge Caravan</b> I would like to point out.
<i>AC Vents in the front arm rest </i>. This is so the air will get into the middle and back of van. 
<i>Duel Power Plugs.</i> Great for family travel. We have 2 kids, which equal 2 game boys. 
<i>Bag rack</i> Rack hangs on back on back seat to hang plastic grocery bags from. Which I really don't care for.

One thing I <i>don;t like </i>about my <b>Dodge Caravan</b>, is no arm rest on the left side of the middle seat. I guess this the standard bench seat that would normally be against a window.
This van is so roomy and comfortable. I felt like I'm sitting in a chair instead of riding in a van.
Of course, I hope to do a following up epinion in a month or so and let you know if I'm still just as happy.
List on the sticker for $23,500. I got a deal at $16,500. :)

<b>*** Edited </b> It has been 1 year since I purchased my <b>Dodge Caravan</b>. I have to tell you I <i>traded</i> it last week for a Saturn. In the year I owed the <b>Dodge Caravan</b> I had it in the shop <b>5</b> times for repair. I was <i> very</i> disappointed in the van. Of the service calls, 3 of them were for the transmission. The last time I had it in, the <i>Torte Converter</i>. If you know anything about cars, you know this is a <i> major</i> part of the transmission. 

Will I buy another <b> Dodge Caravan </b>?
<i>No!</i>
Would I recommend the <b> Dodge Caravan</b>?
<i> No</i>

Someone told me "You either get a <b>Good</b> Chrysler or a <b>Bad</b> Chrysler ". Guess which one I got....
