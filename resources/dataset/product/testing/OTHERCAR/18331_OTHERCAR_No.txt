            Not that I am a mechanic or anything like that, but I do listen to what people tell me about cars.  My dad rebuilds engines for a living he's been doing that for about the last fifteen years or so.  He had a friend who had one of these cars that had broke down. 

When my dad looked at the car he told his friend the engine was shot.  His friend took it back to the dealer thinking that he had some kind of warranty, but the engine wasn't covered.  On top of that the car still had less than 75,000 miles on it and was well maintained.  

This may not be the case with all of these cars, but from what my dad has told me their engines are not manufactured very well.  I don't claim to be an expert, and rarely do I listen to what a mechanic tells me is wrong with my car, but I would have to go with my dad on this one.  

Especially since he always seems to know what is wrong with my car when other mechanics try to lie to me to make me pay more.  Suit yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you.<br><br>
