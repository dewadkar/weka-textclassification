            	I bought my Hyundai Elantra about 6 months ago, it's a 2000 Hyundai Elantra GLS. I needed a new car because I was going to have a baby, and I had a tiny two seater of a VW Fox, which you can read my review on if you so choose. When we got to the Hyundai dealership, the salesman was the friendliest salesman we had met as yet. The others seemed to have the attitude that it didn't matter whether they sold the car to us or to Joe Shmoe.
	When we took our test drive, I had a good feeling about the car, even though we really wanted a new beetle. The seats were very comfortable, and we were excited to find we had actually got a GLS, so we had power windows and such. It was a nice feeling knowing we were going to have a car with four doors and working air conditioning. That doesn't really make it different from other cars, but the price does. 
	We traded in our Fox for about $3000, which was well more than it was worth. I'm glad we got the elantra, though I wouldn't mind one of those Vapor Bugs. <br><br>
