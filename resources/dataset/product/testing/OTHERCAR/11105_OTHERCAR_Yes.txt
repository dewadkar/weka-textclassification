              My Galant was an overlooked option when I was checking out used mid sized cars. I had been focusing on Toyota and Honda and Nissan and then I stumbled upon the Mitsubishi at a local used car dealer. It stood out because of the front end.It was unique. I checked it out on a walk around and was pleased to see it was a pretty nice looking car all around. After a test drive I was impressed.It drove really nice and had a higher amount of quality than  a Ford or Pontiac that I had also checked out. I did'nt even think about mitsubishi when I was looking but I was glad I came upon this car. I have owned 2 Nissans,one Honda accord and my parents have owned 3 Toyotas.The Galant stacked up very well with all of them. The 2.4l engine was smooth and snappy.I hate automatics but this one was a little easier to deal with because it actually downshifted when coming to stops which is nice. I guess they call it a fuzzy logic transmission.It trys to interpret what you are wanting and shifts accordingly.It works pretty well.If you tromp it it will give you a hard downshift and hold it to redline,if you are cruising on the interstate it won't constantly downshift on hills it will just stay where it is.It seems to work pretty well.  I would say that is the only reason I could stand the auto.fuzzy logic is different at first but a good concept.
 The only two complaints I will state are dealing with the plastic parts. The are pretty cheap. The squeek and seem like they would break easy. I have yet to brake anything but the quality is not as high as my nissans. Nothing major just something to bring out.  I have leather seats however which are nice.Very comfy. I never really liked leather seats because they seem hard but these are good even on long trips. The back seats have yet to be tested on long trips but I have never had complaints buzzing around town from passengers. It seems kinda tight for tall people back there but try and find a mid size car that is'nt.right? Buy according to your needs. The front are fine. I am over 6 ft tall and I don't need the seat back all the way.
 Controls are easy to get at except the radio when you have a cup in the cupholders. My sunroof leaks which I think is sun related causing a hardened gasket. If I give it a little extra push down it seems to reseal but on it's own it will leak in a heavy rain.
 The fit and finish of the car is right up with Nissan Toyota and Honda. The reliability has yet to be an issue at 80,000.Maybe some front end work is needed as it gives a clunk now and then,but that's due to lots of gravel road driving.There is oil leaking from the engine I am assuming at the valve cover which then is slung from the belts a bit.Nothing too major just a bit irritating.Other than that it has been a really nice car.
