            I LOVED my Dodge Shadow - drove it for 10 years, and never once had a complaint with it - NEVER had to put it in the shop, so it was with great reluctance that I went out in search of a slightly larger car.  I'm also one of the most frugal people I know, so I shop HARD before making a major purchase such as a car.  My search narrowed to two manufacturers, mostly because of their reputations and longevity - Honda and Toyota. (I don't CARE if my car is not made in America - I work hard for my money, and I want the best value I can get!) I chose the Accord because I couldn't find a 1999 Camry with a standard transmission in our fair city (what's that about?), and I finally got a price I liked, after a couple of weeks of bargaining!  I've not once regretted the decision.  Here's why:  
1)  The Accord handles just beautifully. (It isn't as "zippy" as the Shadow was, but it IS a mid-size car, after all!) It takes turns very comfortably, even if you drive like I do!
2)  I feel much more secure in rush hour traffic, with all the SUV's and big trucks I travel with on my route to work.
3)  I really enjoy the smooth clutch action and easy shifting - it's a pleasure to drive.
4)  It's got a pretty surprising sound system, for factory equipment.  That helps when you're stuck in traffic. ;-)
5)  It may be a little plain, but it's a good looking car. It's got clean, classic lines, and I wouldn't be ashamed to claim it in any neighborhood.

My only complaint - and this surprised me - is the gas mileage.  I figured a brand new, standard shift vehicle would get great mpg, but it gets the same mileage as my old Shadow - around 22-23mpg. BUT, in all fairness, it does weigh 1,000 lbs. more than the Shadow, and I DO tend to drive fast. :-)

I must add an update, after taking my first long distance trip in the Accord. I traveled alone, about 700 miles on interstate highways under construction. The car was very comfortable to drive for hours at a time - I never once felt like I had to make a stop to "stretch my legs", and the most pleasant surprise was the gas mileage on the highway! The mpg I get everyday is in stop-and-go traffic, but on this trip I got almost 30mpg - very respectable! And I'm sure that someone who drove a little more sensibly than I would really get great mileage! I'm even more pleased with the car than I was initially.
