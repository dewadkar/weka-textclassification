            If you live in a far off mountain canyon, up a dirt road in a nearly vertical parking space. Deal with daily sometimes hourly weather changes.
Do you drive thirty thousand miles a year? Make deliveries in the city on a daily basis? Travel long distances to pick up product?
Have to contend with extreme fuel prices, wind, heat, snow, rain and earthquakes? Well then you would know why I bought my Forester.
Forester handles all of these situations runs up and down the mountains everyday and eats less than my sister Becky, (if she were a Vehicle).
I love the way the little Forester works the curves on the mountain roads.
A little more ground clearance would be an improvement.
I enjoy the feel of full time all wheel drive and have marveled at how,
Subaru could get the great mileage and still be available for light off road duty. I haul everything from fire wood to garbage in the Forester.
Driving the vehicle is a pleasure and as a smaller person I find it to be comfortable. If economy, dependability and toughness are your choice in a small sport utility vehicle, check out, Forester.
You shouldn't purchase a Forester if a large vehicle is what you need.
If a van would not do and you can not afford to fuel a full size Truck, Subaru Forester is a tough little Vehicle.<br><br>
