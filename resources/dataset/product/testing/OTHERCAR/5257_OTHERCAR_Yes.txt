            Who is Lady?  A 1995 bright iris pearl Toyota Celica, with an automatic transmission.  I plan to drive Lady until she falls apart.  At this rate, I may go first.  

She used to be called Lady Diana, but when her namesake died in an automobile accident, suddenly that seemed like bad juju.  We met in the summer of 1996.  I walked onto the lot planning to buy a Supra, but there she was, that knockout lavender-blue color, those sleek lines...  it was love at first sight.  Besides, my dad had taken me to school in a Toyota Celica years ago, and he had nothing but rave reviews about his.  I decided to give her a shot.

Most relationships have their ups and downs.  My relationship with Lady is an exception to that rule.  We've been together four years now, long past my usual car attention span.  And quite frankly, I don't care to trade her in.  Ever.  Admittedly, being a woman, I base much of my attachment to this car on sentimental and aesthetic qualities.  However, even a dumb blonde like me knows this car is well put together.  

What are the things you always hear about in good cars?  How about a quiet engine?  I had someone standing behind my car putting groceries in my trunk tell me to &quot;go ahead and start the engine&quot; when it was already running.  How about reliable service?  Number of times my car has been in the shop in four years?  Two.  Number of times it was because the car was involved in an accident with a stationary object?  Two.  So obviously, the car is not to blame.  How about driveability?  I'm very picky about the way a car &quot;handles,&quot; and Lady's got a smooth ride, responsive steering, and excellent brakes (which is the reason she's only been in the shop twice).

The things I put this car through are ridiculous.  I had a well-meaning boyfriend try to change my oil once.  Instead, he drained out the transmission fluid and put more oil in on top of the dirty stuff.  Yikes.  I drove her a couple of miles before I suspected something was wrong.  Number of transmission problems I've had since then?  Zero.

I also loaded her to the gills, literally with everything that would fit inside, and drove her 2000 miles when I moved to L.A.  She never complained, though it was hard to get her up to 80 on some of those hilly roads.  Keep in mind that every book, CD, pot, pan, appliance, and piece of computer equipment I owned was filling her entire trunk, back seat, and passenger seat.  Not too shabby.  I'll never forget that drive, with Lady's great stereo system providing a wonderful &quot;soundtrack&quot; for my trek across the desert lands.  You never know how much you love a car until you spend four days in one.  I could have done four more.

One warning note... I'm a small gal.  My heftier sister found the seats a bit uncomfortable, and couldn't get in and out as easily as I could.  However, she still borrowed the darn thing any chance she got.

There's really not much more I could want in a car.  All my friends love to drive her, they all ooh and ahh when she's freshly washed, and I've never heard so much as an annoying buzz or rattle, despite my mistreatment of her.  While the folks in Beverly Hills take their less attractive luxury cars into the shop for the zillionth time, I just drive by and smile.

And did I mention she's paid for?<br><br>
