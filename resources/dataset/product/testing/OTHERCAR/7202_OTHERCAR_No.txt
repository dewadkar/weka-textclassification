            We purchased our A6 Wagon because it was a terrific value for a lot of car. Since 1996 this car has been fun to drive and performed well.  However, now everyone has figured out what a good car this is and you can see this in the rising price of all Audi models.
My reason for this epinion message is to warn you that Audi has become a victim of it's own success. Over the past four years we have had few problems with our A6. However, the first time our car broke down it was for the transmission. It took three weeks for them to get the proper gasket from Germany to fix the car.
More recently, my wife had an accident at a stop light going only 5mph.  There was no damage to the rear end of the Expedition she hit, however both of our airbags deployed and there was $10,000 worth of damage to the car. The body work was completed within a few days. Unfortunately we have been waiting for new parts (seatbelts,new dashboard, etc..) to be delivered to the Audi dealer for almost four weeks.
The bottom line here is that we (not the dealer) have had to place calls repeatedly to the nice people at Audi and beg them to expedite the parts. I know that they want to help, but it seems as if they have more cars on the road now than parts to service those cars.
My opinion is to be cautious if your buying Audi products. They are terrific when thy are working...but if they break down you may have a long wait to get your car back.<br><br>
