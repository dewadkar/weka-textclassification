              After years of driving used cars with 100K plus miles, it is almost finally time to buy my first new car. The small car market has been dominated by a few main cars, the Honda Civic, the Toyota Corolla and the Ford Focus. But what about Mazda's entry, the Prot�g�? The Prot�g� overlooked by many has gone through many changes. The most significant in the past year or so is the 2.0 liter four cylinder engine. With this newfound power, will the Prot�g� be able to hold its own against the better sellers of the segment? Only one way to find out. I decided it was high time to pay my local Mazda dealer a visit.

Powertrain: A+
  The 2.0 liter engine was introduced for the 2001 model year but traces its roots back to 1992 when it made its official debut on my current car, the 1993 Mazda 626. In the Prot�g� it makes more power and being installed in a lighter car makes it more than up to the task. This engine is also more refined than it is on my 626. I drove the automatic and found it shift very smoothly. It is not the same Ford transmission used on 626 models, instead being a Mazda design from Japan. Overall the 2.0 makes this car easy to drive fast and a whole lot more fun than the other cars in this class. But you may be wondering what the big difference is. It�s the low end power. Larger engines produce more torque, i.e. twisting force. This makes the car feel livelier at low speed acceleration. Many small cars are not known for this. 

Steering/Handling: A+
   Economy car or sports car?  That is what the Mazda "Zoom Zoom" ads ask us. While its true the Prot�g� is no RX-7 it holds its own in many areas. Handling can only be described as phenomenal and not just for the compact class. The Prot�g� is easily the best handling front wheel drive car I've driven including a 1994 Acura Integra GS-R. The Prot�g� has a pretty common MacPherson strut setup but its goodness is all in the tuning. Throw any curve at this car and it gripes like Velcro. The steering has a perfect combination of feedback and power assist. It feels meaty and precise but won�t tire out your arms either. It�s an uncommon trait in such an inexpensive car. But what about the ride? It has a somewhat firm ride but its well controlled and fairly comfortable. My tester had the four wheel antilock brakes(which come bundled with a sunroof and side airbags). They stop the car smoothly and shortly. The brake feel inspires confidence just like the rest of the car.

Interior: A
   Its amazing how small cars have changed. I remember my 1987 Toyota Tercel and how small and crude it felt. The Prot�g� on the other hand is surprising roomy and comfortable. I'll start with the front seats and I'll mention to you that I am 6' 3" and 205 pounds. There is NO small car for sale in this country that is more comfortable for someone my size. I've sat in them all including the Ford Focus. The Prot�g� has as much stretch out room as a larger Mazda 626 and even the Honda Accord! The shape of the seat is perfectly contoured to my body. Unlike so many small cars there is a seat bottom cushion tilt adjustment and it makes a world of difference. The interior materials are of good quality putting some more expensive to shame. The gauges are of the black letters on a white background variety and add to a sporty look, as does the faux carbon fiber trim. The three spoke steering wheel is easy and comfortable to grip. All of the controls are well placed and well designed. Even the rear seat is roomy. The seat is well shaped and splits down in a 60/40 combination. I found the Prot�g� to be quiet for the most part. Visibility is good all around.

Exterior: A
  I remember the very first Prot�g� of 1990 was compared to the Mercedes Benz 190E from a styling standpoint. Well the latest Prot�g� still looks like a more expensive car than it is. The new front end introduced for 2001 adds a more aggressive stance than the 1999/2000 models. Overall this is one of the classiest looking cars you can buy for under $18,000. And the ES comes standard with 16 inch alloy rims, fog lights and a rear wing spoiler. 

Overall: A+
  Mazda has outdone Honda, Toyota and Nissan with its Prot�g�. With a gutsy engine, fine handling roomy interior and handsome exterior, the Prot�g� is the only car in this class that gets it all right. Though a few main competitors come close, not one has this level of overall balance and goodness. And the price fully loaded was $17,750 and that's without negotiating. It�s a huge value for what you get and it may be too good of a value for me to pass up in a few months. So if you love cars and love to drive but can�t afford that BMW you've always dreamed of, I have good news: Your car has arrived!
