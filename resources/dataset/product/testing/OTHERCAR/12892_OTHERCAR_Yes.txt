            I started my research 6 months before I made my purchase.  Coming from a Firebird Formula, I needed to do my homework.  I knew I needed an SUV with a good amount of power since my Firebird had a V-8, 5.7 liter engine.  I looked at the Jeep Liberty, Ford Escape, and Nissan Pathfinder, as well as the Mazda Tribute.  The Jeep Liberty was the 1st I test drove and I felt too high and too tight sitting in this vehicle, and the rear seats did not fold flat.  2nd was the Nissan Pathfinder and it was quite comfortable but not worth the over $32,000 price tag.  The Ford Escape is the twin of the Mazda Tribute, and I could see that the Mazda Tribute was 100% nicer with the exterior chrome trim, painted lower body cladding, and larger & more stylish rear liftgate window.
I went to purchase a 2003 Mazda Tribute, but left with a 2002 (this was in February 2003).  It was an '02 leftover.  I definately liked the interior in the '02 better than the '03 since the black interior trim looked good next the beige interior trim.  The '03 has chrome trim against the beige.  Plus, I wanted a white Tribute ES with a moonroof, and this '02 had it all.
POWER: The power is fantastic and it is much peppier than my Firebird.  I can easiy switch lanes on the highway and take off from green lights.  
SEATS:  The front seats could be longer.  With my long legs the seat would be better if longer.  I have leather & is a nice quality for the $21,000 I spent.  The rear seats are very comfortable and are "theater seating" so the kids sit high.  The rear seats are very easy to flip forward to lay flat.
INTERIOR:  Unless you want a super plush interior with lots of gadgets, the interior is fine.  No complaints here, except that the shifter on the steering column is in the way when hitting some buttons on the radio.
FLIPGATE:  Awesome.  The window can work alone, or the enterior gate (door) can open.  The window is rounded on the bottom slightly (unlike the Ford Escape) and is more stylish and lower to make it easier to place items in it.
In short, this vehicle is worth it's "price tag" and after 3 months of owning this vehicle, I love it.
