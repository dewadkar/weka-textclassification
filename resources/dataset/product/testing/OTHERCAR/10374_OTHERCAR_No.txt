<TEXT>
            I purchased a Kia Sephia in July of 1998. I made this investment mostly because of the price and also my beloved Mitsubishi Galant was stolen. On the test drive I did not go very far form the dealership and although I was not totally satisfied I figured it was cheap and I really needed to get to work. This car has been in the shop over eighteen times for problems. My biggest mistake was paying cash. Although the dealership pretended to care, nobody gave a damn about my safety. So far I have had the battery replaced , brakes replaced three times, radio replaced, starter replaced, reverse light replaced, the engine check light comes on constantly, etc, etc, etc.Too much to mention.I AM DISAPPOINTED IN KIA. Recently two(2) recall notices came in the mail, one for windshield wiper replacement and the second for fuel pump circuit connections.When will this end. Maybe when some is severely injured. Since I am supposed to write what I liked about the car, here goes..... the color is wonderful.!<br><br>
