            We received this Argus DC2000 camera from a mail in promotion. I'm certainly glad that we didn't pay for it!
This comes with a carrying case and cable so that you can upload your pictures to your computer. We list a lot of things on auction sites and thought this would be an idea camera for the value. 
While taking pictures indoors, we followed the guidelines, but everytime, no matter what setting, the pictures were very dark. We went outside and took a picture in the sunlight and the pictures were quite clear and with the proper lighting. 
If you're looking for a great indoor camera, choose another camera, like a Sony Mavica. However, if your shots are mostly outdoor ones, then this camera is a great value for the money.
