<TEXT>
            I bought my Mazda 323-F in 1994 second hand. (It was 1992 made). I have travelled more than 300,000 km with it. During all these years it has had superior performance.
The car is easy to drive and is comfortable for its class. I have never seen a better two wheel drive car in Winter conditions. 
My Mazda has a 1600 cm3 motor which is the perfect one for the car. It gives good acceleration and is not spending a lot of fuel. It has never had a problem except a minor electrical one.
My Mazda is very beautiful. It is difficult to find such good outlook even nowadays.
Every thing in the car is elaborated and is in its place and is long lasting.
The only problem are the spare parts. The Mazda dealer in Bulgaria gives abnormally high prices. Also the Mazda service is very expensive and in some occasions not very competent and correct.<br><br>
