            My husband and I were looking for a nice family car to replace a 15 year old car I was driving. My old car was running fine but small things were starting to go wrong. We researched numerous cars and decided on a chevy lumina, used with around 20,000 miles, but GM stopped making that model in 1999. We had trouble finding a lumina so after reading reviews on the malibu (which were all positive) we purchased a 1998 malibu with 25,000 miles in August of 1999.
Good features of the car it handles well, has great pick-up, easy to reach the controls, and it gets good gas mileage.
Bad features of the car it has a rough ride, cold air comes in around the door handles, and in the last few months I've had the car in the shop four or five times. The car now has 52,000 miles on it. Last month the power steering hose blew on my way home from work. This month it was dripping engine coolant from around the base of the engine so the entire motor had to be pulled to replace gaskets. Our mechanic told use we were lucky the coolant leaked out of the engine and not in, or the motor would have had to be replaced. He also said this is not the first time he's replaced these parts on this model.  Now after bringing home the car an engine light keeps coming on. Our mechanic said the light is not related to drive-ability of the car and he can't find a reason for it. 
I e-mail General Motors home page to see if there may be a recall on any of these problems a week ago and have not received a reply.
I would not recommend this car for anyone, unless you have a money tree growing in your back yard. I joke with my husband that we could have bought a cadillac with as much as we have put into this car.
After having driven nothing but GM cars all my life, I don't see myself ever buying another General Motors car again.     <br><br>
