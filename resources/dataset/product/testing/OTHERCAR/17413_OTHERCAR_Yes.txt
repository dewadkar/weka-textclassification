            I may fall outside the typical demographic purchaser of SUV's...I actually take them off-road.  I am an avid outdoorsman, flyfisher and even make an occasional ski trip...in the natural course of getting to my destinations, I've run into all sorts of nasties:  the Toyota 4Runner can take it.  Arizona rock crawling, high mountain stream crossings and traversing Mexican oceanfront sands haven't stopped it.

It's very well built, ergonomic and despite the miles I've put on it, after a good washing, it drives like the day it came off the lot.

Quirks and/or unadvertised features you should know about:  
A) Stock Goodyear Wrangler RTS tires - decent to a point.  Replace at 30k miles or less.  I had 3 blowouts in 1 weekend with, what I thought was plenty of tread left.  When you buy the replacements, buy them slightly bigger.  They seem to fill the wheel wells out just a little better.
B) Rear suspension (as delivered) is way too soft.  Toyota has voluntarily issued a "Campaign" to replace most of the critical components (Free of charge!) but you might not hear about it unless you complain first.  Once they do that, spend a few dollars on decent shocks.  Toyota standard shocks will develop leaks in short order.
C) Roof rack - this may be a nit-pick but I actually use the roof rack too.  I have a one-man pontoon boat I take when I go fishing.  The rack is not bad but seems to be designed more for aesthetics than actual use.  Front and rear holes on cross-members nearly unusable for tie down hooks.  Consider buying a Thule or Yak after market rack if you have toys that don't fit inside the vehicle.

If you are considering a Toyota, the 4Runner is an excellent choice.  While it is priced slightly higher than many in its category, the cost is certainly justified in my mind by its reliability, durability, resale value and longevity for the road.  When it comes down to it...I'm a cheap SOB.  I bought this when it was 1 1/2 years old and for the condition it was in, it might as well have been brand new.

Since getting into 4wd vehicles, I am a big fan of Toyota.  Prior to purchasing the '98 4Runner, I owned a '94 Toyota Landcruiser.  One of these days, I might hand over the keys to the 4Runner to my wife and pick up a new Tundra.

Until then,
Tightlines!
