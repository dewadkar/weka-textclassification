            I'm not sure if it was out of pity or not, but I suppose the motivation for my brother in law giving me a Fuji MX-1200 should not be questioned.  

I consider myself a pretty good amateur photographer.  I have had a nice camera since Christmas when I was 16.  My Dad gave me that Canon and I'm an expert by now at how to get awesome pictures with it.  Hence the recent problem called &quot;Fear of New Technology&quot;.  

I was very scared when I opened the package, having no idea what to do with this camera that didn't use film.  I sat down to read the manual and learn what I could.  It seemed easy enough, but the language in the booklet could get a bit technical and though it bogged down, I made it through.  

I still found myself fearful of getting stared.  An IM from my brother in law with the urge to just jump in and take some pictures finally pushed me enough to get started.

I was so surprised!  It is so easy to use and the pictures are truly gorgeous.  They are so good that I'm wondering if professional photographers feel the new digital cameras have cheated them out of some of their expert knowledge.

It's a great camera!  Go for it.<br><br>
