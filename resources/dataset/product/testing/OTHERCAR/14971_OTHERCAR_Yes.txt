            After three years of longing for a digital camera, my husband finally came through and bought us a MVC-FD73.  During the time we were waiting, we kept up with the technology which seems to move very quickly with digital cameras and computers.  We also leaned towards advice from my daughter who works in the computer field and has all the new toys. She felt that since we travel a lot the floppy drive would be better because we could always find a store to buy floppies.  She also advised us to get a zoom for scenic and those scenes where you would want a closer picture.  

This camera is very easy to use, just point and click.  The zoom button is in a very convenient place and easy to use while getting ready to take a picture.  The flash works quickly and makes a great difference in a dark setting.  Transferring to the computer is as simple as inserting the floppy disk and hitting a button in your photo organizer program.  

We have used our camera to take pictures from a nearby mountain of the many lakes in our area.  The MVC-FD73 took a great picture and captured the beauty of the land.  I have taken pictures of my roses (close up) and could not have been more pleased with the outcome.  It is a great camera to have with you for those unexpected times you would like to capture with a picture.

We wanted a middle of the line camera to take all kinds of pictures.  The pictures print nicely and we have sent hundreds over email to friends and family who live away.  A great way to keep everyone in touch.  

We couldn't be more pleased with this camera and it was well worth the wait.<br><br>
