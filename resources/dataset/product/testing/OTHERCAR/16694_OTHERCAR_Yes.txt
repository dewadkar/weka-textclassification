            This has got to be the greatest camera ever made!  What a joy to take your pics to a floppy and have them downloaded, viewed and printed within minutes of getting home!!  I am a staunch supporter of my Canon 35mm SLR, and stuck to my guns, taking roll after roll of film while my husband used the Mavica.  We dropped off my film (6 rolls, 124 pics) off at a one hour developer on the way home.  On arrival at home he began downloading his 6 floppys ( 216 pics) and had them available for viewing, and had printed the ones we liked best long before my FIRST roll was developed!!  Now the Mavica travels with me at all times, the Canon still goes along for when the Mavica battery runs low, or when I just GOTTA have the flexibilty that the Canon still offers over the Mavica.  I wold HIGHLY recommend the Mavica to any one!   Life is to short to wait for developing!  Not to mention the $48 I spent on developing, and the $16 on film.<br><br>
