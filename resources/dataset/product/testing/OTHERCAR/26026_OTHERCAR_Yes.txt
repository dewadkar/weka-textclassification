            The marque Land Rover in general and Range Rover in particular are synonymous with amazing off-road performance. My experience with my 1995 County Classic over the past 4 plus years has confirmed this reputation. And I�ve also driven in some of the worst rush hour traffic in the country, deep snow &amp; mud &amp; standing water, sheets of ice and just around and about the town. So�now after 50,000 miles, I wanted to contribute my experience here.

We bought it new in 1995. We were moving to Hawaii (Maui), wanted to do some offroading there, and we had always wanted to own one. Well, two good reasons anyway. We did look at and test drive the new 4.0 SE (and we liked it a LOT), but declined because we know better than to purchase the first model year of any vehicle made in Great Britain and we were concerned that it might not have the older model�s offroad prowess.

Buying &amp; service experience: 10
Top-drawer service and care by an outstanding dealer team. Very low key, very helpful, professional and courteous. Since our purchase, the dealer has been super, even if the authorized service facility in Hawaii didn�t know a low-maintenance battery from an air filter box. They actually poured water into the air box and started it. Yikes.

Offroading &amp; bad weather driving: 10
Here the vehicle, with its air suspension that provides up to 6 inches of chassis travel, shines. I�ve climbed over lava rocks, up and down steep &amp; muddy hillsides, narrow gullied-out dirt paths, across deep sand beaches, and have had to lower the rig to go under a low branch while climbing down a steep stairway of boulders. In my experience, the capabilities of this vehicle far outstrip my driving capabilities.

In bad weather, the feeling of safety, control, and stability is astounding. Driving through deep standing water on a highway�what water? There�s a big splash, of course, but through the steering wheel you feel nothing but a straight track. On snow, it�s not even fun to drive--you can�t make it slide about, no matter how hard you try--because of the full-time 4WD and traction control. Here in Seattle, where it rains a lot, wet roads are a constant while snow is a rarity. On icy hills and deep mud, the rig just scrambles right through it by sort of moving left, moving right as it pulls through the obstacle.

Ride &amp; handling: 8
For offroading, the ride is superb. In one case, we were driving along a �path,� where even Jeep Wrangler drivers left their rigs in favor of the more stable shoe leather, while listening to the CD changer without a skip.

On pavement, the ride is a bit bouncy and a bit noisy from the tires and the engine, but you nonetheless get an excellent feel for the road through the steering wheel. The ride is not a rigid �kidney-basher� like smaller trucks, nor is it isolated and floating like the very large SUVs like the Expedition or Suburban.

The rig does sway a bit on hard cornering, but that is primarily due to the horizontal &amp; vertical wheel travel (and my fast driving), not to mention that each wheel can move off vertical by as much as 20 degrees! In fact, it takes a bit to get used to how it drives: not like a truck, not like a car, and not like other SUVs.

Interior: 8
Love the leather, the power heated seats, the power moonroof, the stereo, the wood, the fine materials. Hate the squeaks. Right now, I have two squeaks that have been with me on and off for years and a new one developing. The dealer is great at getting rid of the squeaks, but they typically turn up again. Front &amp; rear headroom is tough for folks taller than 6 foot and rear legroom is not great (for more rear legroom, look at the County Long Wheelbase or LWB). Interior noise is a bit much, with the engine, differentials, big tires, wind, and transmission noise, but not excessive.

Engine: 7
Super torque for mud, hillsides, snow &amp; ice, climbing over obstacles, especially in low gear range. Unfortunately, with a 4,5000 lb vehicle, 182 hp is just not quite enough, especially getting on the freeway with a short ramp. Also, gas mileage on a good day averages just 11 mpg and unleaded premium only, please! The County LWB has a 4.2 engine instead of my 3.9 V8, but the LWB also weighs 400 lbs more.

Reliability: 8
We haven�t had the horror stories that many owners of both older and newer models have had. In fact, one of our mechanics at the dealer said that the �95 County is among the most reliable of all of the Range Rovers; �They finally got all the bugs out and now they�ve stopped making them.�

The repairs that we�ve had in the 5 years that we�ve owned it (most under warranty): replace alternator (sea salt ruined it), replace radio head (sea salt), brake calipers (a notorious weakness; have them checked at EVERY oil change), replace air suspension sensors, and the center console window switches (which I spilled Coke into!). The air suspension pump is getting a bit noisy these days and will fail sometime, but it is covered under an extended warranty.

As I mentioned, we had some trouble in Hawaii with an authorized service facility. This just points out what every experience Range Rover owner will tell you: a good mechanic is worth their weight in gold. Even though they are expensive, I cannot recommend getting your Rover serviced at a dealer strongly enough.

Value: 2 or 9
Why the range? Well, $50,000 is a lot of money for an SUV; there are many capable rigs out there for not much more than half this cost. On the other hand, if you live in an area with bad weather, go skiing a lot, go camping, spend more time in the mud than on the road, or just want to feel safe and secure while driving ANYWHERE, the value is easy to see.

Should I buy a used one?
Make certain that you know its history, preferably a dealer-maintained history. At the very least, take it to a dealer for a buyer�s inspection. Better yet, buy it from a Land Rover dealer with a warranty.

Would I buy another one?
Absolutely! I must confess that I am very fond of it now and can�t imagine driving a vehicle that is less capable.
