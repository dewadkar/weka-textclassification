            I have owned this camera for about one year now and I am glad that I can share my love for it.  It is simple to use and takes excellent quality pictures.  I use it at best quality and bought a 128mb memory card (Compact Flash Memory is really cheap), so that I can take 126 pictures on one card at the best quality.  

The camera is tough, I have accidentally dropped it a few times and it still works perfectly even with a few bumps and bruises.

I find the software that it comes with also very user friendly and likeable.

The camera also has many other features that I seldom use but are still good to have, like timer and a remote control.

As far as battery life goes, regular batteries can't cut it, however if you invest in a $12 set of photo lithium batteries they will last you a few months, so it is defiantly worth the money compared to regular batteries.

The price of the camera now is about $200 so that can't be beat for this high-end quality.

I strongly recommend this camera to everyone; in fact I just got my brother to buy one as well.
