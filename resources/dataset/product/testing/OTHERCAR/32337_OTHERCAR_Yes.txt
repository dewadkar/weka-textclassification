            After reading about every compact camera on the internet for several months I decided the Dimage F300 (DF3) was for me.  I had a handful of requirements in my search:
- AA batteries (I HATE proprietary battery packs)
- Small enough to fit in a belt pouch comfortably
- Full manual features
- Solid design

Obviously my first requirement dwindled my choices down to practically nothingness.  Still, I maintained consideration of the Canon S30, 40, 45 and 50.  In the end, three things moved me to the DF3:  the lense cover design of the Canons vs. the Dimages, the AA batteries vs. proprietary battery pack, and the price.

I have now had my DF3 for about four months and have taken a lot of pictures.  I am no professional, just a slightly above average snapper with a love of gadgets and computers.  I picked up a 256 MB SD memory card for it.  The camera with four 1400 mAH NIMH batteries and a charger and the Minolta nylon sports case, total cost not including the 256 meg SD card was under $400.  MUCH better buy than the Canons.

I always use the LCD and find that even the 1400 mAH batteries do just fine.  Sure, they could last longer, but we are talking about two AA batteries.  If you want more power, get the 2200 mAH's being offered at other stores online for a great price and it will outlast any Li-ion battery pack out there.  The startup time is plenty quick and everything is ready to go in less than 10 seconds.

There are more manual features than you can shake a stick at, and they work great.  I love playing around with cameras but am no professional, and even still I can get tremendous quality pictures with this camera, far better than my friends' digicams w/o the manual control availability.  The subject tracking autofocus system is a little strange, but it is very easy to turn off, if you do not like it.

As far as looks are concerned, I have gotten nothing but great comments about it.  Everyone is amazed at all that it can do and still fit in my pocket, and it looks nothing but tech-stylish.  The Elphs are smaller, but they also lack the features that this camera has.


After four months and a few hundred pictures and lots of playing with all the features I would recommend it to anyone who wants a camera like this.  The price is excellent and I have had a blast playing with it.  It looks great, feels great, has great response and easy menus and is very easy to manipulate.  The videos come out just fine, and I have done a lot of playing with the black and white mode and the ultra-high speed mode.  Oh, and by the way, the quality is outstanding.  I suppose if I were to compare it with every other 5MP digicam on the market there may be others that are better, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and the DF3 takes outstanding pictures.
