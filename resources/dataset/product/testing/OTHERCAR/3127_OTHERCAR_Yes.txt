            It was finally time to buy a new car.  Having owned Toyota's for years and having great experience both with reliability and low maintenance, it was Toyota again, we were shopping for, without even looking at other cars.  Because of our tight budget, the only model we could afford was the Corolla base model.  We had owned the same for over 10 years and were quite happy with it.  We went to a few dealers and compared prices.  We were discouraged with the lack of standard options, especially the added cost of air conditioning.  For that reason alone, my 14 year old son logged onto the Toyota Web site to check out this option cost and others.  On the Toyota site, there was an interactive page where you can compare any other vehicle to the one you are contemplating purchasing.  He compared many other base models including the new Ford Focus, Chevy Malibu and the Hyundai Elantra.  The process compared standard options, engines, warrantees, etc., and surprisingly, the Hyundai came out way ahead of the Corolla......this from Toyota themselves!  It didn't take us long to drive over to the local Hyundai dealer and after a quick test drive and cost negotiation, we drove our new Elantra home, with more horsepower, every option imaginable and the best warranty in the US!  We have had the car 2 mos, have 25000 miles registered and are extremely satisfied that we made the right choice!<br><br>
