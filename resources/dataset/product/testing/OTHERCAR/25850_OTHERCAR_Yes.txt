            Although I don't own this vehicle, but my dad does, and I have driven it in rain, snow, any conditions.  I feel save in any type of Jeep, whether it be a Cherokee or a Grand Cherokee (that's what I had before and I loved it).  My dad owns a black 2000 Jeep Cherokee Classic, it is a beautiful car inside and out.  The only thing that I don't really like is that he has 17&quot; wheels and the suspension is higher than norma, so the vehicle is easily rolled if not driven with caution.  Another thing is that it is not a family vehicle; there is minimal room in the back for a teenagers' legs.<br>When I eventually save up enough money, I will be sure to buy a Jeep.  I just have felt safe when driving or riding in a Jeep, especially during those bad Upstate New York winters.  I especially felt safe the day I got into my accident and if it weren't for the Jeep I would probably not be here today.<br><br><br>
