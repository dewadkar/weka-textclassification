            Honda is the sort of auto manufacturer that keeps its customers. After driving my Accord for 6 years, I got used to the light handling and easy, sleek navigation. When you have a good thing, you get a better thing from the same place. 

I love my 2000 CRV: it handles and rides just like a car, light and easy on the ground. Easy to park in smaller spaces, takes corners wonderfully. There is so much floor space between the two front seats because the tray table in-between folds down. Sitting in the CRV feels like sitting up-right in a chair in a room -- there's so much space below, beside and above you and the large windows let so much light in.

There are some trade-offs: gas economy in a vehicle this weight means that it can tow only 1000lbs (low compared to other vehicles in the same class). The 4-cylinder engine takes its time going up inclines, cranking up to 3500RPM all the while. And two minor peeves: the trip meter is often obscured by the speedometer, while the odometer is always on view below (switch the placement!); the driver's door lock control is on the door in the same place as the power window control on the passenger doors.

This car is great for people who like the outdoors (camping trips) and want to go off-road without burning tons of gas, but not for big families. It can't seat more than three at the back, so it's not a good car for car-pooling the kids.<br><br>
