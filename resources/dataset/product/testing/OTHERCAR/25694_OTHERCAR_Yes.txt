            We bought our 95 Pathfinder SE 4x4 used with 60,000 miles in Jan. of '01. We traded in our beloved 98 Tacoma 4x4 Extra Cab due to the fact that my wife and I had our first child.

I liked the Pathfinder better than most other import SUVs (I am not a big fan of domestic vehicles) because you get way more options for the same price. We looked at 4Runners, Passports and Troopers and I would have bought a 4Runner, but for the same price as the Pathfinder, that rig would have had a four cylinder engine and roll up windows, unless I bought one with 150,000 miles!

Anyway, our Pathfinder has just about every option, except that it is 5-speed. It has leather, AC, CC, power windows, alarm/keyless entry, electronic adjustable suspension, limited-slip rear differential, tow package, pop-up sunroof, roof racks and even the rear spoiler. I added a brush guard, a K&N air filter, custom wheels and a CD player. I also tightened up the torsion bars in the front (to lift it about 2-inches) and had a rear 1-inch spacer added, so that the truck has a little more clearance in the wheel wells and sits level. From the factory, the truck leans forward a little bit and has very little front wheel well clearance.

Currently, I get about 21 mpg on the highway, but only about 14 or 15 mpg in town.

The only problems we have is that the tachometer doesn't register right. I haven't bothered to take it to a shop for this, because I don't really use the tach and I don't care much if it's out of register. Later, I'll get it fixed.

The truck has all wheel disc brakes and when I use the "sport" suspension mode, the Pathfinder handles very well. I have also off-roaded this truck quite a bit (I even got it stuck up to the doors in a big mud hole) and it really gets through a lot of stuff. The rear limited slip works very well and I only use 4WD for really hairy situations.

As for comfort, I like the leather and any messes the baby or the dog make are easily cleaned up. The dog (he's a beagle) has lots of room in the cargo area and when we go camping, he rides in the back passenger seat. He seems to like both better than in the extra cab of our Tacoma. We have taken several trips over three hours and we had no problems.

One thing I have to say is if you like car stereos, do not buy a Pathfinder older than 1996!!! I learned this the hard way. The Truck comes stock with a built in amplified system and 4x6 speakers in the front and back. If you want to install any kind of a system, you have to gut just about everything and be very creative with where you can put quality speakers. I didn't realize this when I bought the rig, because I was more worried about ride quality, driveability and if everything seemed to work OK.
