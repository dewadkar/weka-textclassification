            I have a teal 1994 Pontiac Grand Am GT and I absolutely love it!  This car is very reliable and fun to drive.  The car handles well in all types of weather, which is very important to me since I live in the Mideast.  I have had the car for three years now and have not had to have any very major repairs done.  It is basically just the normal wear and tear maintenance.

The car rides very comfortably and you can easily fit up to five people in it.  The trunk is rather large as well.  We were able to fit all of our luggage in it last summer when four of us went on vacation.

I love the sporty look of the car, especially the ground effects and the spoiler.  My particular model is loaded, with the exception of a sunroof.

The only drawback to the car is the amount of brake dust that is generated.  My wheel rims get dirty very easily from the dust and it is hard to keep them clean.

I definitely know that I am going to be getting another Grand Am when I get rid of my current car.  I couldn't ask for a more trusted name and reliable performance and this is one loyal customer that is extremely satisfied.<br><br>
