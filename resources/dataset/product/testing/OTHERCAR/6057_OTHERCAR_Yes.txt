            Ok, here it goes.  I am not nearly as good of a reviewer as some of the folks here, but would like to add my two cents of opinion on this camera.  Pardon me for not quoting specifications but those are usually covered already.
Like most I researched my purchase before selecting the C-740 model.  I liked the incredible optical zoom, sharp focus, and relatively small size of this camera.  It is a bit awkward to store due to the lens, but it's not a big deal.
I am not a manual reader, so I set out learning by taking pictures and experimenting with the different modes.  I found the camera operation to be pretty intuitive and straight forward.  I purchased a 128MB Olympus XD card which allowed me to take far more photos than I cared to in a single day.  The battery life of the provided disposable battery packs was astounding, letting me take hundreds of photos before giving out.  I currently use rechargable NIMH batteries and usually tire of picture taking before the batteries wear out.
After driving the wife and the rest of the family nuts taking pictures of them, I took the camera on a boating outing.  Lounging in the rear of the boat I took some great snaps of the gang.  These turned out to be the best pictures that I have ever taken of my kids. 
I have taken zoom photos of birds, butterflies and aircraft.  The best feature of this camera is the ability to use the 10X optical zoom to bring the subject to you. 
The one problem that has driven me to reading the manual, has been low light pictures.  I wouldn't even call them low light, just roomlight has me stumped.  The camera prefocuses and displays a fine image in the viewfinder, but when I take a picture, there is a long delay and finally a very blurry image emerges.  I know, turn on the flash..duh.  But I like natural lighting, not the harsh reflectivity of flash illumination.  I have played with the automated and manual settings, and hope to find the best compromise.  
The video recording feature works, but unfortunately the quality is not very good and the camera does not record sound.  However, I purchased for use as a still camera and it does this quite well.
My wife and I are happy with this camera.  I would recommend that you go to your local camera shop and play with the cameras and go with the one that feels best to you and fits your budget.  I learned much that way.  Good luck!
I also recommend that you take a look at the C-750 as it is now coming down in price and offers a few improvements that may influence your decision.
