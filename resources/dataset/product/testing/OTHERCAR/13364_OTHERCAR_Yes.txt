                 I should first point out that I don't drive the civilian version of this car. I bought an ex-police cruiser. The police version has some added bonuses over the civilian version. A heavy-duty suspension. LT1 engine, rated at 260 HP, and 330 ft/lbs. of torque. A large capacity alternator. Things that the police force in your town will loves about their vehicles.
     It should be pointed out, that when buying a used police car, a few items may need to be replaced. Opti-spark distributor, water pump, front end components, and sometimes transmissions are high wear items on police cars.
     Those may seem expensive, but when you consider that these are basically Impala SS's without the grill, spoiler, interior, and wheels, it's not too bad of a deal. You get a fast car, for a fraction of the price of an Impala SS.
     I love my car for several reasons. First of all, it's a big car, which translates into a safe car. You can haul 5 people in complete comfort. The trunk is VERY spacious. The LT1 is a real performer. No matter what gear you're in, or what the load is, if you press on the gas, you go. Passing is really easy and safe. And with all that power, I can still get 25 mpg on the highway. The police version shakes off the Caprice's heritage of being a 'boat.' The suspension is nice, and for a 4300 lb. car, it handles very well.
     Overall, I'd recommend one of these to anyone. Caprice's are very capable of 300,000 mi.+, if taken care of properly. For families it's a perfect buy. You get the safety, and convenience of a big car, with added bonuses of dual airbags, and 4 wheel anti-lock disc brakes. If you're looking for a big car, with a lot of power, and a good price, an ex-police Caprice can't be beat!<br><br>
