            I bought this camera a few months ago, and have used it through the whole snowboarding season.  

<b>Cost</b>
It cost me around $80 plus $30 for the 64Mb memory card.  64Mb on this camera means over 1000 high resolution pictures (1.3 megapixel or 1024x964).

<b>Feel</b>
It fits very comfortably in your hand, and even has rubber grip on the right side (where you would hold it with the right hand)  

<b>Where I use it</b>
95% of camera's use is on the mountain, which involves getting beat up with me when I fall, getting sprayed with snow, and getting dropped on snow and ice.  In other words - pretty heavy use, most cameras would have been broken by now.  


<b>Menu</b>
Menu gives you an option to switch between picture/video/snapshots, high/medium resolution, flash/no-flash/auto-flash, sound/no-sound and delete.  The problem is once the camera turns itself off, it goes back to default settings.  Very, very annoying.  For example - if you want to just shoot movies and not bother with the pictures - every time camera goes to power save - it comes back to picture mode.  

<b>Taking Pictures</b>
This camera does not have an automatic focus (focus is done manually, approximating from closeup to landscape).  Bad news is pictures come out a little out of focus, but good news is because it doesn't have to focus on every shot - the delay is about 1/4-1/2 seconds.  Problem is you can never guess how long the delay will be, so taking action pictures is "mission impossible"

<b>Shooting Movies</b>
The longest movie you can record is 1.5 minutes.  If you have a large memory card - you can make meny movie clips, but you cannot record, let's say, 10 minute continuously. 
To shoot a movie you have to hold the shutter button, and as soon as you let go movie stops taping.  Once you have shot a movie clip - look forward to a 5-10-20-30 second delay, i guess to store it on the memory card.  
On the bright side - this camera has a microphone, and movies are recorded with sound.   

<b>No LCD Display</b>
This camera DOES NOT have an LCD display on the back, so you don't get to view  your pictures until you download them to the computer.  


<b>Battery Compartment</b>
Battery compartment opens up every once in a while.  After losing a few batteries I learned to tape it with electric tape before hitting the slopes.  

<b>Battery Life</b>
Even with a power-save mode this camera runs out of batteries after about 6 hours of somewhat heavy use (around 200 pictures, or 30 20-second movie clips). 

<b>Web Cam</b>
It works as a web cam or as a camera.  When in web cam mode - power comes from USB cable, and when in camera mode - power comes from 4 AAA batteries.  I never use it as a web cam, but you should be able to use it with AOL instant messenger and Yahoo messenger. 

<b>My recommendation</b>
This camera works very well for me because all I need to do is shoot 5-10 tiny movie clips of someone taking a kicker or sliding on the rail when i'm on the mountain, but for everyday use I WOULD NOT recommend it.  You'll probably get annoyed with a self-resetting menu and will feel un-cool without a LCD on the back.
