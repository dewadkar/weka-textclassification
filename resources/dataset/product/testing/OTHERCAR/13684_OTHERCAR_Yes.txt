            We were already sold on Honda's quality, so when it came time for a mini-van we were pretty sure of what we would wind up with.  Still I had to check out the competition.  Nothing could compare.  In fact, I was surprised that the Dodge rattled so much.

Since we have had our van 3 years now, the only thing that will do is a new one.  The fold down rear seat is remarkable, and the removable middle seats are so easy that a child can take them out.  Recently we put 3 adults and 2 children, one of which was a toddler in our van for a six hour trip.  We pulled one of the middle seats out for additional space, and still had plenty of seating. The rear storage was generous enough to allow all of our luggage even with the back bench up, and the ride was as smooth as a luxury sedan.  The only replacement for this van will be a new model, but I hate to trade this one in.  It has never been in the shop, it gets great mileage, and is versatile and friendly to drive.  I'm still in love with this van.<br><br>
