            I bought my 1993 T-100 in 1999 with right about 100,000 miles on it.  It was a base model regular cab with the eight foot bed, Toyota's 3.0L V-6, auto transmission, aluminum wheels, sliding rear window, cassette player, and cruise.  The truck was in very good shape, and I was excited to pay only $5000 for it.

I was looking for a smaller truck that would get good gas mileage.  My search began with the Ford Ranger.  I've always been a fan of Ford's 2.3L four cylinder, which powers lower-end Rangers.  I saw the Toyota T100 for sale and stopped out of curiosity.  I knew it had the full size bed (meaning you can place a 4' x 8' sheet of plywood flat between the wheel wells in the bed).  The Ranger, like every other compact pickup, does not have a full sized bed.

I chose to buy the Toyota for a couple of reasons.  The full size bed was a huge plus.  Also, the 3.0L V-6 is a great motor that gets good gas mileage.  Toyota trucks also have a higher resale value.

Life with the T100 was pretty good.  It handled like a car, easy to park and a ride that was pretty smooth.  The V-6 had a little punch to it and the auto transmission shifted very nicely.

As for comfort, mine had a bench seat that I just hated.  It forced you to sit very upright and did not have lower back support.  The fold-out armrest was very wimpy as well.  Only extending a few inches, it was more of a shelf than a real armrest.  The radio sounded like a stock radio and there were no power windows or locks to contend with.

With a truck, hauling is always a priority.  On several occasions, I loaded the bed down with close to 1000 pounds of contractor stuff.  The poor leaf springs bent over backwards, but the truck took the load and hauled it well.  If I had intended to use it to haul heavy loads on a regular basis, I would have invested in some extra leaves for the rear suspension.

My only real gripe (besides the bench seat) is the cost of parts for this truck.  I had a power steering pressure hose go bad and I had to mortgage my house to buy a new one.  I replaced the pressure hose on a 1992 GMC one time and it cost me about $75.  The T100 pressure hose is only available from the dealer and it cost over $500!  Yes, you are reading that correctly...FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS for a power steering hose.  

Other than that, I never had any trouble with the truck.  Although, at those outrageous prices, it only takes one problem on a Japanese truck to equal about four on an American truck.

I sold the truck a year later after putting about 20,000 miles on it.  The bench seat got to me, and I was scared to death that some other small part would break and I'd have to shell out big cash to fix it.

Overall, to do it over again, I would buy a Ranger and save about $1000 over the price of the T100.  That would more than make up for any likely repair to the Ranger.  You'd lose the full size bed, but for that price, you could get an extended cab Ranger.  I guess it all depends on what your priorities are.
