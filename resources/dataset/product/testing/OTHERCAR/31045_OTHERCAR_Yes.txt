            I traded in my Dodge Stealth for this car because we started a family and my sports car was no longer practical.  Although I miss my sports car, the Infiniti has been pleasing to me and my new family.  I got the touring package and I think the car is very pretty.  It comes with many standard features that are really nice.  The heated seats in the cold weather are great.  The climate control is wonderful as well.  You don't have to worry about getting too hot or freezing from the air conditioning, it adjusts to the temperature you program.  
It handles really well.  Very easy to park in tight spaces and great at the mall. It looks elegant and the price was not bad.  Get a certified used car to get the most of your money.  Warranted for 7 years or 70000 miles and a great driver protection program.  Roadside assistance is convenient as well as a loaner car when dropping off for service.
Nice for family.<br><br>
