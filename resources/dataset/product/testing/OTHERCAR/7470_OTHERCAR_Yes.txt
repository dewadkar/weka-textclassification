            Having just purchased this awesome car I can tell you that is worth the money.  I have had my eye on this car for a long time and when it came time to get a second car this was my first choice.

This car has look and feel of a sports car and it does deliever.  The GT comes with the RamAir V6 producing 175hp, and it is quick.  Our car came with all the options including leather, sunroof, 6 way power driver seat and the 8 speaker 200 watt Moonson stereo.

There is good room in the car both in the front and back and can fit 4 adults.  The 2 seats in the rear do fold down to provide that extra space.  Traction control is standard on this car, and the 16inch wheels keeps the grip on the road.

The difference between the GT and the GT1 is the sunroof,leather,power seat, cd/cassette player and chrome wheels.  For about $28,000 Canadian you are topped out with all the options.

The ride is excellent with very little noise problem, the engine handles all conditions and fuel economy is average.

This is a great car that provides all the style and power that I would want, and for a reasonable price.
