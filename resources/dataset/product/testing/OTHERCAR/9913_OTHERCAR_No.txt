            When I was searching for a car after my old Camaro died, I ran across a 1993 Mazda MX-3.  The year I bought the thing was 1997, so it wasn't that old.  It was a kind-of accident.  I wasn't looking for it, specifically, just something in my price range.

At first, I was impressed with its looks.  Sure, it was small, but I didn't need a Cadillac, just something to get me around.  I will admit, it was the looks of the thing that first attracted me, but that isn't entirely why I bought it.  I was impressed with the gas mileage (32 highway, 27 city).  I thought it would be a long-lasting automobile.  It seemed to handle well, which is something I always look for in a car.  So I bought it.

Eventually, the looks of the thing started to annoy me.  It was the hatchback that ultimately did it.  But the reason I got rid of it was because things kept breaking.  Even the gear inside the door that lets the window roll up and down broke.  When all was well with the thing, it was pretty reliable.  But if it felt like it, it would break down.  That is why I got a New Jetta (See my review).<br><br>
