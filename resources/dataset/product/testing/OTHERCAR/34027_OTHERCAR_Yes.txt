            I bought this camera as a take everywhere camera to replace a Fuji 401 which delivered soft hazy pictures. Unfortunately the Canon I find is bulky and trying to slide it in a pants pocket usually results in the camera lens covering opening on the way in. Not to mention the cover is flimsy for knocking around with. As for the camera anyone who has ever had an old Canon SLR will quicky recognize many of the modes provided by a dail on top of the camera.  Not to mention the standard program modes, portrait, landscape, sports, etc. Quick dial and your there, no menu's and buttons to navigate. Click to AUTO and its a point and shot. I found the picture quality as excellent compared to the 1 Omlypus and 2 Fuji's I own. There is a 150 page manual on all the features of the camera which is way to voluminous to describe here. Needless to say they provide many manual overrides for your pictures. There are 9 buttons on the back of the camera, counting the three way rocker, which is not the zoom which is on the front of the camera. I found some of the routine functions as counter intuitive, for instance to delete a picture there is a button marked in light blue on the side with a trash can, in black letters on the top is MF, if you press the menu function button it offers only delete all pictures. I live in fear of these markings wearing off all the buttons. Its mystical the choices of where they put things. The zoom is not the rocker switch in the back of the camera instead its a slide at the front of the camera marked in blue with two magnifying glasses and marked in black 1 tree and 3 trees.  There is a button in the back marked with a tulip. Giving you the full range of plant focal lengths. Movie mode is 30 seconds clips, not quite enough and I'm sure soon to be expanded.
The software that came with it is good, though it is not brainless to install you have to read each step in the manual. There is an odd driver install procedures which you don't encounter often anymore in software. Once loaded its fully functional, easy to use.  I tend to go back to my Adobe Photoshop.  I'm playing with low light no flash and so far the quality is okay, I'm sure there are additional settings provided which I'll have to tinker with...overall its a solid camera with whoa many options to set.
