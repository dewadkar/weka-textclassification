            I was doing my yearly digital camera upgrade and seriously investigated each and every digital camera out there under $1500.00. I have been using digital cameras now for over 5 years and each year attempt to get the best &quot;prosumer&quot; model available. I took the Nikon 990, Olympus 3030 and the Canon G1 home for evaluation over a weekend.

The Nikon 990 was the frontrunner originally due to it's superb macro capabilities, but as I used them more throughout the day the G1 became my favorite for several reasons. First it's battery life is way beyond any other digicam currently on the market by a long margin. I have used it over 2 complete days of picture taking and have yet to need a recharge. The Nikon and Olympus were requiring a recharge after nearly half of one day of shooting.

This is using the LCD display quite a bit which of course sucks up battery power big time. The color rendition on the Canon was superior (more honest, not exagerated)and it's photo clarity was above reproach. Ease of use was considerably better on the Canon as well as one does not have to wade though as many menus to get what you need. The Canon far exceeded both of the others in low light focus and low noise in the picture. In fact the others weren't even close in this particular area.

The reason for this is two fold. The Canon offers both a lower ISO (50) as well as a built in noise reduction circuit that operates when the shutter is slowed to more than 1.3 seconds. The LCD is also superior on the Canon as it is brighter and also anti reflective coated for better outdoor use. It also &quot;ramps&quot; up or increases it's visability when in low light so you can still see what you are going to shoot in it with next to NO light. The others are useless in this condition.

The Canon G1 comes &quot;Complete&quot; with everything you will need as opposed to requiring you to purchase them as optional accessories. The single light Lithium Ion battery (not the usual Nickel Metal Hydride) battery with it's combination charger/ac adapter is included with a 16MB memory card. Strap and all patch cords for downloading to the computer are included. The ONLY thing to buy are extra accessory lenses permitting both closer and longer shots as well as wide angle.

All in all the Canon G1 is ahead of the pack and worth the first consideration in a purchase of the latest crop of 3.3 megapixel digital cameras available.<br><br>
