            I thought that a $100 digital camera would be a worthless piece of junk until I looked into this model. Sure it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that are on the market today, but it's got everything you could ask for in a base model (and more) with Digital technology. It ships with an 8MB memory card (which is upgradable), built in flash, 2x digital zoom, 1.3 megapixels. It runs on 2 AA batteries. No power adapter came with it which I would like to have. USB cord is included, as is FinePix software to download and edit photos from your camera to your PC. It has a self timer if you feel you must be in the photo! There are menu options for different flash included auto flash and red eye reduction. The camera has a 1.5'' view screen on the back where you can also navigate the menu options from. This camera also has a movie recorder so you can use it as a mini camcorder (more on this below). The camera comes with a black pouch that can clip on your belt or strap on your wrist. The camera is very lightweight so it's not in the way if it's on your hip or arm. 

The red eye reduction isn't perfect, but its worked ok for me so far. The flash hasn't failed me yet, even in bad situations my pictures have always come out very clear.
The movie recorder allows you to use the camera as a "mini camcorder" and record live actions rather than still pics. You only get 30 seconds per clip. And the 8mB memory card that it ships with can only hold 2 clips. But, it's great for recording a quick clip of your child to send via email to relatives, or catch an impromtu moment on video. If you need more than 30 seconds, you should buy a camcorder not a camera!

I found the menu options to be hard to navigate. The icons are not self explanatory so I am constantly going to the owners manual to clarify what the settings mean. Since most photo opp's are off the cuff you don't have time to read a manual. The camera does have auto admustment features so the camera will adjust itself automatically as best it can. To be honest I have had great luck with this option and not had any blown photo opp's using the auto settings. If the menu icons were more self explanatory I would be able to take advantage of the settings the camera has built in.

The color quality of the photos has been outstanding with this camera. Very clear, vivid and colorful. I am very pleasantly surprised at this as I was expecting low quality with an inexpensive model. The Finepix software that comes with the camera to download directly to the PC is great. It automatically detects when your camera is connected to the PC and pops up a few options on retrieving the photos . You can erase the memory card, download the pics and leave them on the card, or download the pics and and erase them from memory on the camera in one step. I like this option myself since I always forget to delete the pics from memory!The fine pics software also has editing tools so you can crop and resize the photo's, etc..

The only downside with this camera is the battery life is very short. Turning off the display while taking pics can add significant life to the batteries, but it's still pretty bad. I always have a spare set in the camera pouch. If I'm on a day trip and taking photo's I have always needed the second set. The 8MB memory card claims to hold up to 61 photo's but I've never got that many stored on it. I've capped out at about 35 pics. These were taken in Las Vegas with lots of lights and activity so maybe that added to the size of each pic. I'd highly suggest upgrading the memory card, there's nothing worse than running out of memory and not being near your PC to download the pics and clear the memory. 

In summary, this camera has to be one of the best values in digital cameras. If you think you will complain if you don't have all the bells and whistles than I think you may want to look at the more expensive models. But for the money, this camera is certainly more than capable of rendering high quality pics and doing so very reliably (this is the key!). I've used this camera extensively in all settings......at the zoo, weddings, on vacations, in the car, at night, broad daylight, created video clips and emailed them, posted pics on the web, printed them out and more..........and I've NEVER had any trouble with this camera's performance. If you want reliability, clarity, and ease of use at a very cheap price, this camera is the one!
