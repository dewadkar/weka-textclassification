            My mother owns a Grand Cherokee and absolutely loves it!!  It provides the perfect combination of power and elegance.  It is amazingly smooth to drive, but powerful enough to pull a boat without any probelms.  It has good &quot;pick up and go&quot; on the high way and is very roomy.  Laying down the back seat can also allow an ample amount of room to store and transport.  In fact she was able to bring my entire sterio system, TV, VCR, Computer, Monitor and clothes to college when I moved here.  I don't think she would trade it for anything except maybe a Landcruiser or 4 Runner.  But for the money it is a great vehicle.  She has had a littel electrical problem once or twicw with the cruis control but it was taken care of.<br><br>
