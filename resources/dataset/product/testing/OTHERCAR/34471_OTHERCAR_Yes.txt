            I bought my 1999 Daewoo Leganza around 3 months ago. I was debating between it and a 1997 Honda Civic. The prices were about the same but after a test drive the Leganza was the only option for me. Aside from a few paint scratches and a small hardly noticeable pink mark on the interior floor, my car looked brand new. The dealers were very nice and helped me purchase my car even after the stern looks  I threw across the table at the first mention of the interest rate they wanted to offer me. After bringing the interest rate down and convincing them I would only take it if it had a CD player I signed the papers and drove of in my new car. 

My four cylinder, 2.2 liter automatic Leganza has a slow start but after shifting into the highest gear can out run my friends Pontiac Grand Am. The ride is incredibly smooth and extremely quiet. 

On the inside is were the term affordable luxury gets its meaning. The back seat is incredibly roomy, seating 3 average sized adults with room to spare. The trunk large enough to haul all my junk and more. Up front I have powered windows, locks, and mirrors. ABS and the air conditioning are my favorite features of my car. 

The only draw back being when it rains. Water seems to run straight from the front windshield and directly into the driver side and passenger side windows. When smoking  or a fast-food drive-thru this can be a bit of a annoyance. Rain guards are purchasable and are on my list of things to get when I some more $$.

My Forest Green  Leganza gets excellent gas mileage. During normal everyday driving I can get 280+ miles on a full tank of 15.8 gallons. A weekend drive from Seattle area to the Okanogan area of eastern Washington just last weekend required only one full tank to get there and back. The ride there was mostly highway and freeway and at 90+ MPH (don�t tell mom) I felt comfortable and secure and not like my car was going to fall apart right there like my old Corsica used to.   

My friends on the other hand tell me Daewoo should have stopped at TV�s. Of course these words usually come from those that don�t have cars, and those that do usually drive vehicles that should have been sent to the junk yard 20 years ago.  I love my Daewoo Leganza and with my full coverage warranty lasting until 2008 I plan to be driving without problems and in style for a long, long time.
