            The RR Silver Seraph is just the ticket for that jaunt to the deli for another case or two of Grey Poupon.  At 216K a pop, it probably should have a bigger trunk to lug all that mustard (sure, yer gonna get into one jar on the way home, just in case you run into another SS during the journey - in my neck of the woods, this would be a long shot) but this is the only quibble I have about this monstrously overpriced example of British auto-making.  A car that costs more than most houses in the U.S. really has a pretty small niche, when you think about it.  Unless you're living in your own Silver Seraph down by the river (right next to Chris Farley's van), how practical can it be as an investment?  Come to think of it, when was the last time a British car really made much sense? Don't burn a cell thinking about it...

What I Love About This Vehicle:  Looks like a boat on wheels so should be attractive to the nautical set.  If you dress like Ted Knight in the Caddyshack scene when he's partying on his new boat, you're lookin' good in this baby!

What I Hate About This Vehicle:  If you drive it yourself, everybody thinks you're just a chauffeur, or somebody who just hotwired the beast and is trying (without success) to look inconspicuous.

What Is It Like To Drive This Vehicle:  Hard on the mind, due to the cost of even a minor repair.  Imagine guiding a wagonload of the world's most expensive crystal down a road populated with manic road warriors who want to play chicken.

Who Should Buy This Vehicle:  Juan Samaranch (biggest ego in captivity requires a man-sized car to cart it about), Donald Trump (kind of a religious thing with him), Al Gore (some of that campaign funding might as well accomplish something).

Who Shouldn't Buy This Vehicle: You, me, and 99.99% of the rest of the world's population.
