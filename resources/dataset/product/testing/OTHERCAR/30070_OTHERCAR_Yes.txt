            Let me begin by saying that the Kodak camera has filled all of my needs.  It has very good resolution, a nice size screen and good software to upload photos.

The menu system is very easy to use, the pictures come through without a problem and you can manipulate the photos fairly easily on the camera itself.

On the downside, the camera is a bit bulky compared to the others that are out there now.  It also seems to have trouble focusing at times.  I have to take multiple shots before the little green light shows that I have actually focused on something.

Battery life is another concern.  While I don't leave the LCD screen on a lot, the batteries do wear out rather quickly.

Overall, the Kodak was a great first time digital camera purchase.  For my next camera, I will be looking for a smaller, more pixel, less battery hungry choice.<br><br>
