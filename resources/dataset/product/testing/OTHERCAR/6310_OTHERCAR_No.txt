            The best way to ensure a headache is to buy an Avenger and have the Dodge dealerships make the repairs.  I bought my 1996 Avenger ES new at the dealership.  Within the first few months small things started to break; switches, handles, plastic.  I brought the car in to have the switch on the door that turns the interior light on replaced.  It is very annoying to open your door at night and get into a dark car. After waiting two weeks for the part to come in, I drop the car off in the morning and pick it up in the evening.  The switch was still not working.  The mechanic that worked on the car stated &quot;We must have replaced the switch on another black Avenger&quot; (Have we heard of license plates?, VIN numbers?) Well, I was fed up and took the used switch from them.  I never found out what they did to my car, but maybe it lead my transmission problems.

About my transmission problems, at 40,000; 60,000; and 65,000 miles the transmission needed to be replaced.  This car now has it's fourth transmission.  I think I need to replace the transmission every time I have the breaks done.  The Crysler Corporation was helpful the first time, I still had to pay a deductible.  20,000 miles later when the transmission broke again, Crysler told me I had &quot;to take responsibility for my car.  Since they helped me last time they we not going to help as much this time.  I was lucky they were assisting at all.&quot;  I felt this is very obnoxious since you should get more use out of a transmission than 20,000 miles.  The rebuilt transmission sent from Crysler broken again, but was covered under the service warranty.  I was given a rental car and seriously debated on returning to pick my car up.

Well, the switch is broken again and I have put about 8,000 miles on the last transmission. I am looking to sell this car.  Anybody want an instant headache???<br><br>
