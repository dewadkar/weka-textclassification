            About two weeks ago, my boyfriend and I purchased a 1991 Dodge Dakota Club Cab.  It only had 91,000 miles on it and we were very please with the condition it was in.  The body was in great shape, it purred like a kitten, there was almost nothing wrong with this truck.  Notice the key word almost there.

If you are looking into buying a 1991 or 1992 Dakota, let me tell you some facts about the one I have.  This truck is a whiz to work on.  There is so much room in the engine that you don't have to worry about taking everything out of it to get to the spark plugs (or something similar).  The engine in this truck has stayed the same for years.  I had owned a 90 Dakota so I knew this truck would suit me well.

The truck rides smoother then I thought it would.  The front seats aren�t connected into one bench seat.  They are the separate captain chairs.  The cab has one long bench seat instead of the two bucket seats.  There really is a lot more room in this truck then it looks like from the outside.  

Anyway on to the important part.  If you are looking into buying a truck like this (or the 1992 model) make sure to ask about the safety recall that they had on this truck.  If the owner or the dealer has no idea what you are talking about, I don�t know if I would buy it from them.  You see, there is a recall on these trucks to replace the manual valve in the transmission.  I know most people don�t know what that is, so I will just tell you what can happen if it doesn�t get fixed.  There are two possibilities.  If you move the gearshift selector toward but not into the park position, after a short delay the truck may jump into reverse if the engine is running.  If the engine is off, the truck may roll down hill.  Kind of  scary if you think about it.  I advise you to be sure this problem has been fixed before you buy it.  If it hasn�t� been fixed, Dodge will fix it for free with absolutely no cost to you.  

I have owned 3 other Dodge vehicles and I know they run well, are easy to maintain, and last a long time.  If you are looking to buy one, I tell you now, you won�t be disappointed.
