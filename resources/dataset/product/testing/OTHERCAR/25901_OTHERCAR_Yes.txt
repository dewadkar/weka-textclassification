            I got my breeze as a default from the dealership I went to on my birthday. It was the best car I ever ran across! I am 25yrs old, so image is important to me and I also travel a lot so comfort is just as important.I have a white 1998 EXPRESSO with power everything! I feel like my car is worth 30,000 even though I spent less than twelve thousand. I have been hit by 2 drunk drivers on 2 different occasions and my car held up like a champ! I will buy another Plymouth when this one is paid in full.<br><br>
