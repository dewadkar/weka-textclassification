            If you want to be able to do relatively severe off-roading without spending a fortune, getting any year used Samurai 
and modifying it is the way to go.  I have about 250000 miles on my 86, my kid has 180000 on his 86.  We are both on 2nd engines, and both are about due for another backyard ring and valve job.  A while back I picked up a 3rd Samurai as a parts car, but it was in really good shape except for the trans, so I picked up a FOURTH for the transmission so I could rebuild Sammy number 3.

Paid $3100 for my 86 in 1991 when it had 80K miles on it. Paid $2000 for my son's 86 in 1993 when it had 76K miles on it.  Car 3 (an 88 model) I got for $400, with a noisy transmission and engine that wouldn't pass smog, but it had new tires all around and a 2 piece fiberglass roof, and was driveable.  Car 4 was a basket case (an 87) that I paid $250 for, but as it turns out both the engine and transmission (although both out of the car) were good!  Let's see, that's about $5750 in purchase prices.  Considering mine and my son's, add another $5000 in transfer case modifications, gear swaps, replacement engines, new springs, new shocks, fold down windshield, homemade body lifts, etc.  Stretch things a bit and maybe I've sunk $12000 into these 2 cars/trucks total.  But for that 12 grand we've put about 250000 miles on them...and mine will go anywhere a jeep will now that I have lowered gears and increased tire size.  Twice a year I go out to the Humboldt Sink in the middle of NV and off-road with buddies...all of whom are on motorcycles or ATVs.  So my "oversize ATV" goes the same places except when it is really narrow, but I have a seat belt, radio, and heater!   Total cost per mile other than gas and oil has worked out to less than $0.05/mile.  ($12000 spent divided by 250000 miles driven).

Let's see you do serious off roading with a Hummer, Range Rover, Jeep, or Toyota for that cost per mile including modifications.

Just about the best cheap little off roader you could imagine.  Just be sure not to drive it like a Corvette when on the highway.  (And don't drive your Corvette like a Samurai when off road.)

My other "on-road" vehicle? A just-purchased 1995 Lincoln Town Car.  Wow, talk about culture shock switching back and forth between these!  But each has it's place and is well suited for it's purpose.
