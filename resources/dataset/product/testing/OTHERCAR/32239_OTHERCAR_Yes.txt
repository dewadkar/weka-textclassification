            I recently traded in my 2001 Audi A4 Quattro 1.8T for an almost new 2002 BMW 330xi. My wife really didn't like the Audi's safety record (although the new version did better) and I wasn't thrilled with the turbo lag (very small but still there).

I owned a BMW M Roadster before (see earlier review) so I was a bit apprehensive about another BMW. After doing a lot of research, and test drives, I returned to the BMW family. This car just feels "solid". My A4 had much more body roll in corners and just didn&#146t feel as connected to the road as this BMW. I think Audi does a better job with the interior but I just feel better driving the BMW. Going 80mph in my A4 was OK (but I didn&#146t feel secure) and the brakes were adequate, while 80mph in this BMW is effortless and the brakes are confident. I remember how my M Roadster felt driving through a twisting road at speed. This car has that soul. Maybe not the same level of performance, but something just feels better. The seats are VERY supportive yet still feel comfortable. The engine is silky smooth and power is just a touch away. The brakes have a feel that is hard to get, not too grabby but not too soft. The steering is heavy enough to inspire confidence but not excessive. I could go on about the different systems but I think you get the idea.

Everything is not perfect though; the interior is OK but should be great. The controls require you to read the owners manual thoroughly. I spent 30 minutes with the salesman and I still learned a few things from reading the manual (twice). The radio is OK, but should be great. BMW charges options that other brands are including for free, like a folding rear seat. I wish the Audi interior team would jump ship and go work for BMW. While we&#146re at it why not throw in a Lexus quality assurance team. These things are not deal breakers but show that BMW is spending their development time on the fundamentals (engine, suspension, brakes, safety, etc.) that I can appreciate. 

As long as this car stays together (which I think it will) I think our garage has found a new friend.

UPDATE: I have had this car for about a month now and I am more in love with it than initially. The snow performance was very good, although I'm sure dedicated snow tires would help even more.
Now that the weather has turned warm I was worried that the AWD would make this car less fun to drive. I don't really notice the AWD aspect. My A4 really felt like a front wheel drive and the rears would "kick in" if things got squirrely. This BMW feels just the opposite (which is much more fun). I am still getting used to the automatic but it is pretty transparent. I have used the manualmatic mode a few times and ,although not as fast as a manual, it does the job very well.
I am not feeling any buyer's remorse at all.
