            I have been researching on this car for a while. I have been driving Korean cars for a while and were pleased with them (till now). Sonata looks like a very good deal if you do your research on the Internet and read specifications. Good price, good look, good safety and ...
Also even thought they have not been selling a lot in US, but looks like people were starting to buy from Hyundai.
I had made my mind when I went for test drive. But it proved one more time to me that the first step of researching any car is test driving it, otherwise you end up wasting your time. I couldn't believe my ears when I started the engine. Engine noise was very loud and looked like it is gonna explode soon. Driving was not fun at all and I knew immediately that I am not gonna buy this car. I could feel every bump on the road.
Acceleration was poor too. In the end when I was parking I tried to take some sharp turns and I had to go back and forth a few times t turn.  You wouldn't know what I mean unless you test drive it. I am not an expert in cars and you should try for yourself. But I am a good driver and I always care about small things because if the manufacturer is not caring about them, it means he would not mind about other things too.
Having a good warranty and side air bags to me looks like just some good marketing practice.
