            I just traded in my 1998 Subaru Forester for a new Aztek.  I love my Aztek so much more than the Forester, even though the "experts" rave about the Forester, it is really just a square station wagon.  It rides low to the ground.  My Aztek rides up high like a minivan or SUV and seems twice as big inside as the Forester.  

The features I like best are the automatic headlights that you never have to turn on or off, the remote keyless entry that can pop open the back end, and the great stereo.  I got one with a lower option package to keep the price within my range, but it has everything I wanted: Auto, CD, Cruise, Power Windows/Doors, Tinted Windows, all for $250/month for 5.5 year lease with no money out of pocket!  It's a lot more car that I was ever expecting for my price range.  GM lowered the price this year and added rebates to make this the best value for a cool car.

The one problem I had was the rear view being blocked by the spoiler.  I don't know why Pontiac didn't put in a larger rear view mirror to compensate for the big rear windows, but I solved that problem with a $4 "visor" mirror from Meijer that clips onto the rear view mirror.  It works great!

I really didn't even consider the Aztek when I was looking for a new car, but after stumbling across one while checking out the new Pontiac Probe, I fell in love.  I didn't even recognize it with the new one color styling, and one look inside hooked me.  It's so spacious and comfortable to drive, I knew I was going to buy one.  Everyone I run into that owns one tells me how much they love it too!  

I read somewhere how the Aztek is like the ugly duckling.  The other ducks made fun of it because it was different, but it as time passed, it grew to be a beautiful swan that stood out from the crowd with it's unmatched beauty.  Also, don't judge a book by it's cover.  Once you get inside an Aztek, you can experience the comfort and size it has that puts the other similarly priced "small" SUV's to shame.  

If you are looking for a vehicle the has the cargo room of a midsize SUV, but rides like a minivan, try the Aztek.  It is the best value on the road.
