            I bought my 1992 Eclipse because it was a solid feeling car.  I spent two months looking at many makes and models of cars before making this decision.  Yes, buying a car is a major investment.  I would do this purchase over again today, I love my 1992 Mitsubishi Eclipse.  I have owned the car for eight years, in that time I have had only one major break down, and that was the computer, it needed replaced.  It took me three weeks to figure out how to be able to afford to do this.  I found a computer with the exact numbers in a salvage yard for $100.00 and a mechanic to put it in for $90.00.  Now this was a substantial savings, the dealer wanted $1200.00 just for the computer.  I was very lucky, the one I found works great.  This car has failed to start for me once, the battery had a dead cell, I replaced it and it hasn't failed to start since.  I have had the brakes and rotars replaced once.  The car has been alligned once.  Too this day I can drive it down the highway and it tracks as straight as a arrow.  It rides like a brand new car, I wonder if the company has continued to make such a sound well made car as the one I have.  The transmission shifts smooth as glass, it will jump out of reverse once in a while, and always has.  I had it into the dealer a few times when it was under warranty, they never did get it to where it wouldn't jump out of reverse.  This engine has never used a drop of oil, and the engine exterior is oil stain free as well.  I don't know that I would opt to have the 1.8 liter engine in it again if I had it to do all over again.  I have had a tick in it for about five years.  I spent $1458.00 on it three years ago at a dealership in St Louis, they never did find out what was causing the tick.  At this time I wish I had added some money to it and just had a new rebuilt engine put in it.  I guess we live and learn.  They looked at the main and rear bearings, let me just say they had the top, bottom and rear of the engine apart and told me they still couldn't find the source of the tick.  It holds just under new engine specs compression per cylinder.  This I was told by the mechanic that just replaced the computer, he also told me it was one of the cleanest eight year old engines he had ever looked into.  I would recommend this year Eclipse to just about anyone, have it checked out by your mechanic before you buy it.  It has given me excellent sevice, with minimal problems.  I would have to say it is a very sound car in suspension, general undercarriage, transmission, engine and body.  I keep it clean, and waxed to protect it and it has no rust on it, and seems to be a car easy to prevent rust from starting.  I question the new body style in the 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse, I think they took away it's sleek look and made it look like a Mustang, but that is a personal opinion.  I don't like the look of the new one at all.
