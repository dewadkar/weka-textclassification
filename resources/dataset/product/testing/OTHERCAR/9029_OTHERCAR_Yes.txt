            This is the second Kia in my family and probably not the last. We bought the Sportage 2 weeks ago after spending too much to put a new tranny and transfer case in our 4WD Ford pickup. We went to the Kia dealer because they were so helpful when we purchased the 2000 Sephia. My brother in law has a Isuzu Rodeo that he paid $28,000.00 for and he likes the Sportage better.
 The Sportage has tons of room and every option a person could need or want. The 4WD is great and even when it's not in 4WD, it holds the road like a champ, even in these horrible Michigan winters. We have had no complaints regarding the vehicle and the 10 year 1000,000 warranty is an added plus.
 The Sportage is comfortable and the CD player sounds good, though I think for the $462.00 they charge for it could be better spent putting in a good brand of aftermarket CD player.
 The only thing that I have found, is that there is a little bit of wind noise when I go down the road, but the dealer is supposed to take care of that next week. All in all, I highly recommend the Sportage to anyone who wants a reasonably priced and extremely safe vehicle.The side impact panels and roll bar top coupled with dual air bags and driver knee bag make you feel a little safer.<br><br>
