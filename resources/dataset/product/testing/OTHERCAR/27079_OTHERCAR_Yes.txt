            OK, a solid year looking to buy a reasonably priced, near luxury sports sedan/wagon. EVERYTHING test driven, some good even great handling cars. But nothing that said gotta have it, especially pushing a sticker of $40K in some cases. 

Last year even checked out the Sabb 9-3 5dr as its unique hatchback layout gave it added functionality and great visibility. But the lack of traction control--even as an option--was a killer when some competitors (like Audi) could toss in AWD as a modestly priced option. 

Fast forward a year into GM's lordship of Saab and the Detroit boys seem intent on making sure that the Swedish meatball flyboys compete. Hence traction control on the 9-3 SEs (midrange) along with a full year of GM's premium OnStar system. 

Now things get interesting. 

Better still, when the entire car market starts to cool, GM doesn't flinch at deep discounts to move unmoving models. No "protecting the brand" for the pocket-protector gang. 

The upshot: a fully loaded 9-3 SE 5dr (leather, sunroof, 205hp turbo, the OnStar system/subscription, traction control, 16 in. alloys, metallic paint, heated seats, headlight wipers, premium sound, 4-sp auto with sport and winter modes, power memory driver's seat etc.) that lists for nearly $36K can be had for $28,200. 

That means an out the door (taxes, tags, etc.) price of under $30K for tight euro sports sedan. Free sked maintenance for 3 yrs. plus a bumper-to-bumper warranty for 4yrs offers good protection against any Saab flakiness, which really does not seem to be that bad for this model. It helps that the dealer has a bulletproof rep, so another dealer might not make the leap so easy. 

Already have experienced a new Volvo owner flummoxed by the car and the deal. "205 horses? Mine only has 185. Twenty-eight thousand? Are you sure its not a 2000?" 

No doubt about it, the car isn't for everyone. It looks funky, drives kinda funky. But it can seat 4 humans, 5 in a pinch, unlike the say, an A4 or 3-series. Its walnut and leather are a notch above the Passat and at least equal if not superior to the Volvo.  

It might loose a drag race or two to its 6-cylinder opponents, but haven't you outgrown that? Besides that $5 to $10 grand in your pocket is bound to slow you down a little.......
