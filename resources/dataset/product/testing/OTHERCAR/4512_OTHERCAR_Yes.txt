            We have owned our 1992 Tercel since it was new. It is a 4 door,air,automatic transmission and am/fm/cd. We have driven the car 68000 miles so far. My wife and I both like the car very much. Other than normal care, we have had no problems with this car at all. It is pleasant to drive both around town and on the highway. It spends a lot of time in and around the town we live in, but we have taken it on many interstate trips. We just ordered a new Toyota Echo. We are only trading this one because we like the look  of the Echo, and there is more room inside them. The biggest complaint we have with the Tercel is the seats don't lay down in the back. This make's it tough to carry anything but small items,without putting the front bucket in full recline and using this area to carry your bigger purchases.Needless to say this means the other person get's to ride in back on the way home.<br><br>
