            At age 58 I went out to buy my first new car on my own. (I am married to a mechanic so this is no small feat!) Looks paid a role in my research because I figured it would be the first and last one I bought. We were going to be moving to the flatlands, so I wasn't as concerned about horse-power as I normally would be. My main requirements were: 6 cylinder, short turning radius, good ground clearance, and comfort. 

I test drove the Isuzu Rodeo, Toyota's, Blazer, Mitsubishi Montero's, Honda's, Suzuki's etc. My fender polishing bud's severely warned my about buying any Isuzu (but how come there's so many on the road?) and Hubby wanted me to stick to Chevy (I made him come along for a test drive to show him I tried). That, and knowing I would really pay for it if I didn't like it after I bought it, kept me researching and on edge for 2 months.

The only things I don't really love about the Xterra are the placement of the cruise control on/off switch, the cave man version of the 4 wheel drive, and the itty-bitty glove box. There is NOTHING I hate. I love the size and thank my lucky stars I didn't settle for a Tracker or Vitara sized vehicle. It packs well for long or short trips, and passengers love the stadium seating. Don't know that I'll ever have 10 wet bathing suits to put in the little overhead carry thingy that limits you to 30 lbs, but might find a use for the rack. Since we didn't move to the mid-west, I would enjoy a stronger engine for the mountains. This one does the job, just not with the grace I'd like. (Read: 350ci Chevy in a Chevy Tracker!)

The car has great handling and I have never needed 4 wheel drive to get out of a situation. The posi seems to take care of most (and &quot;Yes&quot; I DO go off road.) I've noticed the wind buffeting, but never had a problem. I feel like if it's bad enough to blow you off the road, then maybe you shouldn't be out there anyway!

The 'terra is going to be 1 year old on December the 1st and I have 33,000 miles on it. I LOVE THIS VEHICLE!!!
