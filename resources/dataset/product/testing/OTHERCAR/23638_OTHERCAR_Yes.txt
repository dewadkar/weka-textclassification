            I bought this vehicle new in 1996.  It is a two door Sport model.  It has a 4.0 litre, V-6 engine and standard shift (I opted for standard because I like it better).  It has AM/FM cassette, rear wiper/washer/defogger, driver side airbag, AC, rear shoulder seat-belts, rear heating ducts, shift on the fly 4WD, and 15 inch aluminum wheels.

I now have 68,000 miles on it.  The Cherokee is an excellent car to get anywhere you want.  The acceleration is fast, the all-weather handling holds up, and it gets reasonable gas mileage (~17-18 mpg to ~23 mpg).  On long trip you get better mileage by staying below 70 mph.  It starts right up every day, even on cold winter mornings.  The 4WD works great.  The standard sound system is pretty good with the 2 extra speakers in the back.

One problem is the cornering.  But to solve this, don't drive like you're on the Grand Prix.  Another is sharp turning when in 4WD.  I sometimes find that when the wheel is turned almost to the limit in 4WD, the Jeep jerks.  So I remove the 4WD until out of the turn situation.

So far I have not had any problems that required fixing.  I recommend this automobile to anyone.<br><br>
