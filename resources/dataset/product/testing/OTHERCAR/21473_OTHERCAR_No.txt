            I bought my Mark VIII new in late 1992, when it first came out, with much fanfare. It was (and is) a beautiful car, and I traded my '86 Mark VII for it. The Mark VII was a good car, but suffered from some electrical problems and brake problems. I finally traded it when the entire dashboard lighting went out, and was told it would cost $300 to fix it.

So I bought the brand new $42,000 Mark VIII, with almost no discount.

A lot of money, but I was assured it was all new, and state of the art.

Initially, I loved it, but soon thereafter, I noticed a low whistling type noise from the rear end, which appeared only between about 30 and 40 miles per hour. Unfortunately, that's a very common speed around town. The dealer tried everything, and eventually, the factory reps came and looked at it. After about six months, they decided to put in a brand new drive shaft, to replace the original, which finally solved the problem.

As the car has aged, the only problems have been with the automatic transmission, and the air shocks. The transmission seemed always to have shift points that were right in the middle of the most common speeds. Eventually, the shifting problem led to a complete transmission overhaul at 90,000 miles, which was about $1,500 and not under warranty. Also, those wonderful air shocks have now been replaced at all four corners, at a price of about $300 each, plus the inflator, which was another $300.

Compared with the Mark VII, the Mark VIII has a much larger trunk, better acceleration and much better gas mileage- average of 21 mpg for me with mixed highway/city driving. But it still has some basic Lincoln problems- high depreciation cost, transmission and quality issues.
Nevertheless, it is still beautiful, and fast, and a great car for long trips. It loves to run all day, and let you out feeling relaxed and unstressed.
