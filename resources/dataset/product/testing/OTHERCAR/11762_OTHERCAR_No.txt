            I recently purchased the DC3200 camera from Kodak, basically for the name and reputation that Kodak has, and for the good price of $189 from Wal-Mart.  I brought the camera home and found it very easy to set up and was able to start taking photos immediately.

This camera has very little memory to it, and I was only able to take about six pictures before I ran out of memory.  After taking two sets of pictures, the batteries ran down.  I went and purchased another set of batteries and BAM.....these went down again.  This continued until I got to my 4th set.  There is no AC adaptor, so therefore batteries were my only option.  I'm not sure if it was taking the pictures or the fact that it takes a while to transfer the pictures to your hard drive that ran them down so quickly.

I bought this camera because I like to sell things on Ebay.  Once again, on the quality of the pictures, I wasn't impressed.  If I had a light on in the room and used the flash, the pictures were too bright.  If I didn't use the flash, the pictures turned out too dark.  About the only time that I got a decent picture was when I took the camera out into the natural sunlight, and I'm not willing to do that in the winter time to take all my pictures.

I think that quite possibly this could be a good camera, especially for a beginner, but because of all the problems that I experienced, I took my camera back and got a new one.  You may have better luck than me, and maybe I just had a bad camera with all the problems that I experienced.  I see that everyone else here has rated this camera good, but I thought I would let someone know of the problems that I have experienced with the DC3200.
