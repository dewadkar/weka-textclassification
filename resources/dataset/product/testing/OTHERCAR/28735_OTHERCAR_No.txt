                 In 1992, a family member of mine bought an Eclipse brand new. It is a &quot;flashy looking sports car&quot;. Mitsubishi makes a decent car today, but in the late 80's and the early to mid 90's, they left alot to be desired.
     This car now has 162,000 miles on it, 8 years later. The engine has had a terrible annoying tick in the lower end of the engine for some 2 years now, and we just had to purchase a processor for the car, which is the car's main computer system that controls the every function of the engine and all of it's components. On most vehicles, the processor costs anywhere from $110.00 to $350.00 at the dealer. So, when the processor went out on this Eclipse, I thought well, no big deal, it's only a couple hundred dollars or so. So, I called the Mitsubishi Dealer to inquire if they had one in stock, and how much it would cost me. The dealer told me they had several in stock, and they run $1300.00 each, and then asked me if I desired to have him hold one for me. I was very fast to tell him absolutely not! Come on, $1300.00 for a component that probably costs the automaker under $150.00 to manufacture??? It makes absolutely no sense to me at all! How can they do that to people? So anyway, this gentelman at the dealer goes on to tell me that processor malfunction is very common on this particular model, from 1991 to 1994 in the Eclipse, Eagle Talon, and the Plymouth Laser models. I asked him to justify Mitsubishi pricing this component so high, especially when they know they built a bunch of faulty processors. He had no answer, except he told me that he had 10 people standing in front of him, and that he had to go so he could assist them.
       I've been in the automotive sales field for almost 9 years now, worked directly selling auto's to consumers, all the way to becoming a finance and insurance manager (the guy in the back, when you're signing finance papers to take delivery of the auto). As an F&amp;I manager, I discovered that there are no banks, finance companies, and very few credit unions that will approve a deal on a Mitsubishi Galant, Eclipse, or any other vehicle with the 1.8 Liter SOHC engine. They have all told me that they are just pure junk, and they will not finance them. That folks, is telling you something for sure!
     All in all, the Mitsubishi Eclipse (1991-1994) is a sporty looking, nice handling, tiny car. The inside is barely large enough to fit 2 adults, and do not even think about putting even your poodle in the back seat, he will not fit! I am very unhappy with Mitsubishi, due to their pricing of their parts for a car they so poorly built. If an automaker builds a number of poorly built engines/electrical systems, the last thing they should do is price the replacement parts so outrageously that the average consumer cannot afford to fix their own car. They should in fact, give the unfortunate consumers a large break on the prices.
     I will/would not recommend that anyone purchases a Mitsubishi Product of any kind, and not only due to my experience, but due to what I've seen since I've been in the auto business. You simply would not believe it!<br><br>
