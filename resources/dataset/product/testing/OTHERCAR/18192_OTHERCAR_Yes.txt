            I purchased a used Nissan Pathfinder several months ago and love to tell people how much I enjoy this vehicle.  The roomy interior and smooth ride you get with this SUV is a wonderful surprise.  We live in the interior of Alaska and the 4x4 on it has been a much needed and worthwhile purchase.  I find that going to the store is as easy as going to offload our four wheelers.  My added moonroof gives me the feeling of an even sportier ride.  It can comfortably fit 5 people with plenty of room for gear or groceries.  While pricey it can provide the needed space and comfort levels families or individuals may need.<br><br>
