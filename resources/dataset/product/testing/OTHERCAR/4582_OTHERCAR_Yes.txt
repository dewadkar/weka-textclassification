            Okay, well next month - July 2000 I will have had my 1997 Hyundai Elantra GLS Sedan for a total of 3 years.  I have managed to keep the miles low,  so now the odometer reads only 35,000 miles.  In the 3 years that I have had the car I have had very little trouble with it.  All of the problems have been covered under warranty and my Hyundai dealer has been extremely helpful in every case.  Most of the warranty items I have had done have been minor.   (i.e. adjusting sunroof wind deflector, replace plastic moulding, etc.)  I am a perfectionist so others may not have had all the cosmetic repairs done that I did.  There was only one instance that I had to have it towed in the case of faulty spark plugs in -10 degree weather here in NY.  This was understandable given the harsh winter of 1998-1999 but Hyundai had me rolling in a rental car and my car towed free to the dealer and fixed by the time the day was over with no cost to me.

All and all I have been 100% satisfied.  The car is a pleasure to drive in all conditions.  There simply is not a better value on the market today.  The 2000-2001 models will offer the best warranty in the business.  The car drives like it was brand new even after 3 years and 35,000 miles.  It's quiet and has only 1 rattle which is intermittent.  I would recommend this car to everyone that is in the market for an inexpensive vehicle.  Make sure you evaluate the competition.  The 2000 Ford Focus, Nissan Sentra, and Dodge Neon.  Simply put, you'll see that the Elantra is the most car for the money.  

Hyundai has really come around since their big market changeover.  95+ models like the Accent and the 96+ Elantra models have a much better reliability record over the old Hyundai Excels, Scoupes, and 89-94 Sonatas.  That's possibly why the company's motto is &quot;Driving is Believing&quot;.
