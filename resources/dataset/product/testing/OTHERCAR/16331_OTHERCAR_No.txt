            The HP C200 was the first digital camera I purchased because of the low price.  I must admit that the camera was worth what I paid, however, there are other cameras on the market that offer better quality for the same price.  I used this camera for about a month before selling it.  There were three major problems that I found with the camera.

The first thing I noticed was the LCD display.  Unlike most digital cameras, HP decided to not protect the LCD screen at all.  Whenever i accidentally touched the screen, it would be impossible to wipe clean.  Fingerprints were always visible on the display. I've seen other digital camera's LCD covered with a sheet of plastic. After using the camera a while, I also noticed that many of the pictures are very dull.  The colors are not as vibrant and rich as other digital cameras.  The C200 does take very clear pictures though and that may make the camera a winner already.  

The processing time between shots was also a drawback.  It took a few seconds before the camera could take another shot, unlike other digital cameras I have used.  Transferring the pictures was also time consuming, but all digital cameras have this problem since they depend on a serial port connection.  I bought a separate flash reader for this reason.

Overall, the camera had a lot of drawbacks.  Not only is the camera bulky and awkward to hold, but it is heavy.  But once I again I must say that pictures were sharp and for the price, the C200 is a decent entry level camera.  <br><br>
