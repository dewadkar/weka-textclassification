            I purchased my Mavica in March, and haven't regretted it since.  I'd wanted one since my sister brought home the High School's Mavica FD73, but by the time I had enough money to buy one, I decided to go with the FD88.  Not only have I taken wonderfully clear pictures, I've zoomed to my heart's content, gotten close ups of things I could only dream of before, and all with the ease of one click.  I looked at other cameras, to be sure, but the biggest reason I went with Sony was the fact that it takes floppy disks and not those expensive memory cards.  Consider it carefully when/if you buy one; some of the memory cards are upwards of $100 and floppy disks are cheap!  Sure, the memory cards hold more pictures, but what happens when the card is full and you don't have a spare?  I'll keep my Mavica for as long as I can, and will definitely buy another one when the time comes.  <br><br>
