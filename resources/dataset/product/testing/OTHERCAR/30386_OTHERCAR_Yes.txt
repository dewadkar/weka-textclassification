            I bought an early Aztek. I compared it to other vehicles by values. There simply is nothing else that compares. I've driven it about 6 thousand miles and have had no troubles. There are three people in my family and anything larger is senseless. Some people can only look at this and try to make &quot;witty&quot; comments. Chances are they haven't done anything more than look at a picture. I didn't buy this to get attention. I've owned other GM vehicles with similar powertrains and have had pleasant experiences with them. They may not be &quot;cutting edge&quot; but I haven't gone broke keeping them on the road. The Aztek has very good road feel, far superior than any of the Ford or Chrysler products. Now that my kid is older, I am thrilled to rid of a minivan (forget the other descriptions it is one) that has sliding doors. I don't care who makes the vehicle, sliding doors suck. I'm convinced that one of the reasons this vehicle is so quiet and tight is hinged doors. And this vehicle is quiet. I had an open mind when I first drove it. Since then I read all the &quot;roses&quot; that have been tossed at it. I do believe that I made the right choice. 
Got to include what happened a couple weeks ago. It snowed about a foot a couple weeks ago. I watched Windstar struggle to get up the road in front of my house. Then I watched an older Caravan do the same. My wife left for work soon afterward, she took my neighbor too(she left her Honda Accord at home). When she came home, all she could say was goods things about the Aztek's ability in snow. You've got your choices, unlike some people who have no connection with ownership of an Aztek and have written reviews to make themselves a buck, you've got my review. And I like what I've got. <br><br>
