            I own a 1998 Lincoln Navigator and have for about 20 months. I love the vehicle and have had ZERO problems with it. It is roomy and rugged, yet very luxurious and has very nimble handling for such a large vehicle. I have owned about 10 vehicles over my life and this is without doubt the best one I have owned to date. 
Mileage is about 13.5 miles per gallon highway, about 11.5 miles per gallon city. Handling is great, both on and off the road. 
Four-wheel drive switching is trivial; you can run AWD (all wheel drive) all the time, or switch to 2 wheel, four wheel high, or four wheel low via a dial on the dashboard.
Interior climate controls are EXCELLENT! I stay cool in summer and warm in winter, and the internal temperature can be set to any desired degree setting from 65 to 85 F. 
If I must find one thing wrong it would be that the engine in the 1998 model is slightly underpowered, but the 1999 and 2000 models have bigger block engines than the 1998 model so this flaw has been corrected. 
The Navigator is a very well thought-out and constructed vehicle, and I highly recommend it.<br><br>
