            I have been driving a Buick Century for a year and a half and for 20,000 miles.  So far the car has been very reliable (knock on Wood.)  The only thing that has needed to be repaired was a belt that was fraying.  That isn't too bad for a car with close to 100k miles on it.  

I recieved this car from my grandfather when my Saab died.  It was a big transition going from a sport sedan to a normal sedan.  The engine in this car provides adequate acceleration.  The braking also seems to be adequate.  The biggest plus of this car is how reliable it has been

Now for the Cons.  The turning on this car is terrible.  I rented a Uhaul a few weeks ago and it could turn better than this car.   The interior of this car seems very dated.  The dash is similar to the cars that you would find in the early 80's.  Also if you plan on buying a Century and plan on putting a CD player in, it can get pretty ugly.  You have to dismantle the whole front of the dash, you might want to leave it to the store if you are a novice.  

Update - One other annoyance.  When you press the the button to wash the windows it squirts about a half gallon of the fluid out.  This is really annoying this winter with all the snow and salt.  I have to refill the thing every couple days when salts on the ground.

Overall, the Century is a good car, It is solid transportation and that is what comes first on my list of priorities.
