            I've now owned the 1999 Audi A4 (2.8) for approximately 4 months, and I think I still get excited to drive it EVERY DAY!!!  My A4 is equipped with the Quattro system (full time all wheel drive), leather interior, the cold weather package, the 6 disc changer (trunk), the premium Bose Sound System, and the leather wrapped sport steering wheel...

Ok, so let's start off with the interior features of the car.  
PROS:
The interior is all black leather and looks so slick!  The leather doesn't get hot in the sun, and everything looks stylin' at night when the red lighted dashboard sharply contrasts with the black paneling and leather.  The seats have lumbar support (standard in the 2.8) which makes for very little strain on your back, especially during the long haul!  There's also a lot of space in the trunk for those road trips so don't worry about luggage. 
CONS:
The back seat is SMALL!  REALLY SMALL!  If you have a lot of people in your family and this is the car you're planning to buy, DO NOT!  This is definitely going to be a problem.  I just graduated from college and all of my friends and I go on 1 to 2 hour trips all the time.  It's very rare that I volunteer my car, only because of comfort.  For short distances, it's definitely comfortable, but I wouldn't push it much past that if you're gonna have adults in your back seat.  

So let's move onto handling.  
PROS:
I used to drive an Acura Legend, and yeah, for the times, it was real nice, real comfortable, and I thought it handled so well.  Uhhhh, NO!!! WRONG!!! The A4 is the most incredible combination of sport and luxury!! I've gone out of my way to make the tires squeal, and believe you me, it takes much more than a tight turn...So what it comes down to is this.  
CONS:
The A4 is not that quick in a straight line.  I think Audi says it does 0-60 in 7.3 seconds. (in my opinion, not that impressive), but honestly, it's really the handling you get with the quattro that impressed the hell out of me!  I feel like I can go as fast as I want (within reason) and not worry about skidding, or swerving.  I've turned lane switching into an art since I bought the A4.  Ok, so now that I got you on the handling, right??? 

Let's talk about the safety...
PROS:
I haven't tested out the airbags yet (knock on wood) and so I can't say for that, but I do know that was definitely an influence in my decision.  If the A4 didn't have the safety standards it does, I'm sure my insurance would've been considerably greater.  The brakes in the car have already saved my butt once when doing 55 in a 45 and a deer jumped into the road.  I guess it was a combination of that spectacular performance and the brakes.  It's also nice to know that all A4s have side airbags as the standard.  
CONS:
Couldn't tell you!  

Finally, there's the exterior appeal...
PROS:
I LOVE IT!  I can't complain about it at all.  The finish on the paint is so smooth ( My car is silver, SURPRISE!) and it looks so good even when the weather is terrible.  The combination of the black leather and the silver exterior is absolutely elegant.  The A4's exterior does not scream anything in particular.  It's a combination of sporty and luxurious all in one, which I suppose is quite fitting.  
CONS:
I'll tell you when they change the chassis...

price
PRO:  not too bad for what you're getting
CONS: I just got out of college so I'm pretty broke as it is

side note:  The BOSE system was recommended against by the dealer but I went with it anyway, and I am so happy I did.  I feel like I'm always at a concert.  CRISP, CLEAR, BEAUTIFUL!
