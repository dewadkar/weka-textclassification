            While the 2003 Accord may not cause passionate excitement, it grows on you each time you drive it.
I bought the EX V-6 which comes with every available option except the navigation system which I decided was too expensive.
I will not dwell on style, which is very objective. Look at it yourself and make your own opinion. To me it looks friendly whith just a touch of sportiness and elegance.
My first choice was a Lexus ES300 because after safety, I value a quiet ride most of all. I am afraid to fly and go on long road trips a couple of times a year. I think a quiet car makes the trip more enjoyable and reduces fatigue.
The only reason I didn't get a Lexus ES300 is because I found a super deal at a Honda dealership in Buena Park, and they drove it to me from over 200 miles away at no extra charge.The whole deal was handled over the phone and was the most hassle free car transaction I have ever had. Many dealers will not give you a quote over the phone, much less sell you a car and deliver it.
I looked at a lot of other cars and test drove a Passat wagon, since I like wagons a lot. It had less power and while the interior was more luxurious it was not as quiet and cost a lot more while requiring premium gas. I would also have been happy with a Camry but again they wanted a lot more money and it had less power and required premium gas for the V-6.
The Accord is not a sports car but it is light on its feet and handles very well under normal driving situations.I feel that if you really want excitiment when you drive you should buy a powerful motorcycle.
I cannot imagine many situations where you would need more power than the 240 horsepower engine offers.More than adequate for passing, freeway merging etc. And this car is rated 30mpg on the highway using regular gas and is also an Ultra Low Emissions vehicle!
The engine is also very quiet and road noise is low although not as low as a Camry or Lexus and wind noise from the large side mirror is noticeable above 70mph.
My car has heated leather seats, front side air bags and air curtains, tilt and telescoping steering wheel dual zone climate control, in dash 6 disc CD player with great sound, traction control, ABS, and 8 way power drivers seat. The back seats are comfortable and have a center fold out cup holder. The back seat also folds down for more cargo room. It also comes with a moonroof which is ok, but I would trade it for high intensity head lights if they were available.
This is a well put together car, my only complaint is a slight buzzing noise on the passenger side that I think comes from the seatbelt anchor. I will have the dealer check this out.
I don't think you can find a better car for the price.
