            Just a little over 2 years ago I bought the Kodak DC25 Digital camera.  Cost back then was about $325 and the camera has been a workhorse.  Today, this antique can be had for about $100 on the resale market and is well worth it for an entry digital.  Don't overlook the Photo-enhancer software from Pictureworks (the manual helps too).<br>The only drawbacks are the LCD display (it's sometimes difficult to get a clear image, especially in strong light) and the somewhat slow transfer from camera to computer.<br><br>When the camera is in HIGH resolution mode it can store just about 14 pictures at 493 x 373 pixels.  In standard mode you can squeeze in 29 photos at 320 x 240 pixels.  But you can mix resolution according to your needs.<br><br>Overall, it's a compact, lightweight camera which will fit the needs of many at a really good price .... just don't overlook the &quot;extras&quot; I mentioned.<br><br><br>
