            I have the 9-5 SE, which has the 200HP engine and a few extras over the regular 9-5.

Pros:
The car is exceedingly fun to drive.  It is very torque-y and thus quick.  The sound system is awesome with a standard CD and cassette.  The radio reception is especially strong as well.  The seats are comfortable.  The trunk space is awesome, even without the back seats coming down, which they do.  Over all, the car is just a great package at the most reasonable price around.  I compared it to the Volvo S80, The Lexus GS300 and 400, the BMW 528, the Jeep Grand Cherokee (I traded in my '95 Jeep for the Saab), and a few others.  In all others, the insurance was also much higher than the Saab - at least in New York City.

Cons:
Leg room in the back is limited, but more than manageable.  If you get the add-on for the roof rack, it creates a whistling noise on the highway (above 40mph).  You can solve it by putting a small piece (which I think I may design myself) in the center than hangs below by only a few inches.  That noise can be very annoying.<br>
