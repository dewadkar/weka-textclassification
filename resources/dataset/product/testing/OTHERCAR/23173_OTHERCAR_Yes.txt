            My girlfriend purchased a 1984 Honda Accord LX sedan in 1989. It had 66,000 miles, and other than a necessary timing belt replacement it lasted as a reliable transportation vehicle until May 1996. Guess what type of car we purchased then? Yup, another Honda Accord LX 4 door sedan. It's 4 cylinder engine chugs just a bit getting up to speed when merging on the freeway, but we love the dainty gas sipping qualities: averaging 22 mpg in town and 27 mpg on the freeway. In 3 1/2 years of steady driving only one thing has needed repair: the driver side power window developed problems in the relay,(not a fuse). The cockpit style controls are well laid out and there is a arm rest cubby between the driver and passenger seats with space for two medium size beverages. The heating and air conditioner are adequate, with reasonably easy to figure out controls. The body hardwear is great, and the car came from the dealer without any of those annoying loose rattles or little parts that fell off. None have. I'm 6'3&quot; and have enough leg room. The bench rear seating is comfortable for average sized people, although behind my seat, which I put all the way back, it would be suitable only for a child. We'll probably trade it in after 6 years and although I wish Honda made zippy midsize pickup trucks, we'll probably stick with the Accord for reliable and cost-effective transportation.<br><br>
