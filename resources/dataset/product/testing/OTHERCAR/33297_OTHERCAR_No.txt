            Hi,

First off I want everyone to know that this car is my 6th Suburu in a row I have bought. 4 others I drove for well over 140,000 miles and they were great ! One other the XT was also great but had a bug or two. Now about my lovely Forrester, 1998 model. Since I started to lease it 2 years ago the following had to be fixed and the following explainations were given by Suburu America.
From the get go I had to replace blower motor. It was under warranty but I lost valuable time leaving the car at the dealer for one day. Now at this point I have gone thru 4 (yes 4 !) sets of wheel bearings. First time I paid out of pocket , 2 months later again it went bad and this time was under warranty (hooray !) . 12K miles later again it went bad and this time the mechanic tells the service manager the wheel boot was causing it all along. He also whispers to me that these bearings are causing the dealership fits but no recall has gone out ???He claims that is why they are going bad. Okay, so I pay another $140.00 to replace boot and get another free bearing only to find to my horror it again goes bad 2 months later. Now the mechanic and service manager bring me over to car and they say the axle was the cause all along. Moisture is leaking into the assmebly and it is causing excessive wear. I call Suburu America repeatedly and finally 1 month later they agree to pay for this repair but only after I had to endure Suburu's insistence that they all were unrelated and they were my responsibility. Well Duh Suburu, unrelated ?
Okay let's back up a bit and talk about the engine. I have had to replace the main internal seal which costs $7 but when all the labor charges were tallied it was over $900. Again the say it was my responsiblity and i lost 2 days service of my car. Next and two months later I get a leak out of the engine block. My responsibilty. To sets of front breaks so far, both my responsibility. Now for the clincher,
recently I developed another oil leak from the palce where the seal was leaking only this time the mechanic states it is the oil pump. Well I fought again with Sububr America and lost again !! Again my responsibility but on top of this the discovered a timing belt tensioner (some kind of hydraulic device) was worn. damn this repair cost me another $700 out of pocket.
basically all I can say to sum up this model is that it is a walking time bomb waiting to go off. Be aware. Ironic thing about Suburu America is that they are well aware this car will be going back in service with another owner when my lease expires in a couple of months. God bless the person who buys this lemon. Also if anyone has ever been assisted by Suburu leasing I say you are extremely lucky. Every time I called them they blew me off and made me deal with Suburu America.
I still do believe in Suburu's though and my next one may be the legacy model that has always doen well with me but then again the Honda's are looking mightly attractive !
