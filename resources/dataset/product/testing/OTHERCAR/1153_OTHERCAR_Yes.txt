            Let's see...Today is the 18th of June and I have an update.  The car is still running very good.  Although, I did notice some flickering of the interior lights so I took it in on the warranty.  It turned out that the alternator was weak so they replaced it at no charge to me.  I believe this was due to the fact that my car was a prior rental car, which means a lot of starting up, which means a lot of strain on the alternator.  I really love this car even still.  No other problems to report. 

(6-4-03)As of today (5th day of ownership), I will say that I LOVE this car and I am already growing very attached!  I also called on the recalls for my Dodge Neon and there wasn't a problem.  They go by the VIN number.  I will say that I have a 9 month old that I travel with a lot and I have no worries.  Not only that, my husband's kids love it.  They said it is very comfortable and roomy in back.  This is with a car seat sitting in the middle.  It is VERY comfortable for me and my husband as well.  It has a lumbar support seat for the lower back which is a nice feature for long travels.  I have full confidence in this car.  I have no worries at all. It is a nice family car with a "STUCK UP BABE" touch. :) The sporty look gets me a lot of attention to say the least.  It has a lot of power which I love.  I have a 5 speed. What else can I say?  I love, love, love it!  

I will really be testing it out in July when I go on vacation to California, from Phoenix to Kingman to California.  This will be the best test run for the car.  This car is costing me around $320/month and $165/month in full covered insurance.  I'll tell you what though, I haven't thought about it much.  It seems like a very well built car.  I have seen many reviews about the earlier models not being so reliable and having front end problem, but I think that the Dodge Neon is just getting better and better with each year.  Mine is a 2000 with 47,000 miles on it.      

(6-3-03)Ok, I have been doing some searching around and found a good website that will help anyone, not just Dodge Neon owners.  This site is great!  It has information on any kind of recall you may need.  This is especially helpful to me since I have a 9 months old.  I can check on baby items that have been recalled.  In the mean time, I found 3 recalls on the 2000 Dodge Neon and I will be taking it in to make sure everything is already taken care of on it.  Here you go:

(5-30-03)We have had this car for a total of 24 hours and I really gave it a test run today in the 150 degree weather here in Phoenix, AZ.  It is a very comfortable ride and my daughter loves it.  The stereo is really nice feature and I like the sporty look.  Although the sporty part could be the reason I am paying a high price for insurance, but I really don't know.  That is something to think about.  Other than that I think it is well worth the money we are going to put into it.
