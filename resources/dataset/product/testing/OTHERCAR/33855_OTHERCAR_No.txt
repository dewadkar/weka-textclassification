            In May 1998 my new husband and I took my car to the local Mercury dealer to trade it in.  Now I like BIG, roomy TRUCKS while my husband likes small cars.  So we compromised and got a mini van...ok so more compromising on his end than mine.  :-)

We bought a Villager that had about 9,000 miles on it.  My dream car...lots of room and it is large :-)  We decided that after we had our baby we would need more room in our vehicles since we travel a lot so it seemed to be the perfect choice for us.

Our first trip was from Great Lakes, Illinois to Virginia Beach, Virginia.  I was 6 months pregnant so being uncomfortable wasn't anything new.  It drives smoothly and pulls a small trailer wonderfully.  You couldn't even tell that the trailer was there.  Speed limits of 65 and 70 miles per hour didn't even make a difference.

Changing the seats out can be quite a task.  I am a fairly strong woman and still needed my father to help me get the center seats out.  They are also hard to get back in and locked down.  They are very heavy and quite awkward when it comes to trying to move them.  The back seat moves easily, I just wish that it could also be taken out.

But then we took our second trip.  We are a military family so we do quite a bit of travelling.  This trip was a move from Virginia Beach, Virginia to Mobile, Alabama.  My husband did most of the driving in the van due to the fact that it was a mini van or a large moving truck.  Since his preference is small we know which he drove :-)  Anyway, since he didn't want to drive the moving truck he didn't complain about the van.  After the move he said the seats were rather uncomfortable after about 4 hours of travel.  At least the one month old baby was comfy in her seat, right.

Since our move down south we have taken several trips to Colorado and West Virginia to visit our families.  Since we travel a lot we are always sure to take extremely good care of our vehicles.  Oil changes faithfully, new tires at the first sign of needing them, you name it we do it.

Colorado is a 25 hour trip from where we live now and West Virginia is 16.  These are not two trips I would recommend to any Villager owner.  In fact, I wouldn't recommend going anywhere that you might have to sit in the seat for longer than 3 hours (less time if you are taller or heavier).  My husband is right at 6 feet tall and I am just under.  And I must admit that I am not exactly thin.  These seats were made for a barbie doll that didn't have to worry about needing extra comfort for a large caboose.  Our main reason for choosing this van was that it was supposed to be a comfortable travelling vehicle.  Yeah, right.

Since May 2000, which was our last out of state trip, we have started experiencing some weird problems.  

Being in the south where it is quite warm we don't usually use our heater but when we do, we like it to work.  We are going through times that heater won't turn on, or if it does, it won't blow heat.

It started wearing tires unusually fast and at weird places.  We took it into a reliable shop to get the tires replaced and also had the front end checked.  Thought that maybe with the odd wearing pattern that it needed a front end alignment.  They tested it and it showed that everything was fine.  So we replaced the tires and went about our trip.  So we wrote that off to bad tires, hopefully that is all that it was.  No one can find anything wrong with the van.

Now we have an undiagnosible whine coming from the front end.  We have all the belts checked and everything else imaginable.  Weird thing is that the whine gets worse while you are idoling.

Now to the scary problem.  My auto locks take over when ever they please.  If you try to open or close doors, unlock the passenger side front door, or close either passenger side doors, you will end up locked out.  You had better be sure that you have your keys and that you didn't accidentally leave them on the floor board when you put your toddler into their safety seat.  My daughter was almost locked in the van the first time it happened.  I almost forgot my keys on the floor board and heard a strange sound (that of the doors locking) when I reached to stop the door from closing.  I had to allow myself to smash my hand in the door to keep it from locking her in and me out with no keys.

Maybe, it is just MY van that is possessed and the rest really aren't that bad.  I didn't see many unhappy Villager drivers, but I won't be buying another for awhile.  Or at least until they can fix this one.
