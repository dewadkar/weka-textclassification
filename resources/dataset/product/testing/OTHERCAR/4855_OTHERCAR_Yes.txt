            I have owned mid-size and full size Ford products for over 15 years.  A good friend of mine works for a Mitsubishi dealership and I had stopped by to talk about local football and he asked if I might consider trading my car for a new Galant.  I told him that I didn't think he could get me out of my car because I was $4000 in the bucket and the Ford dealer I bought it from couldn't even deal with me.  He said he would bet $100 that he could get me out of my Taurus and into a new Galant with little or no change in payment.  I told him that if he could do it, I'd trade.  I had seen Galants on the road and thought they had a unique look compared to the other foreign makes that their looks kind of run together and are not as distinguishable as Mitsubishi vehicles.  He offered me to test drive one the 38 Galants that he had on the lot and see what I thought.  I chose a Pearl Red ES model with the 2.4 liter 4 cyl. powerplant.  I was used to driving my Taurus with the 3.0 liter V6 so I was a little skeptical about even considering a 4-cylinder car.  I got on it pretty hard to see how well it would perform on the highway under demanding conditions.  It was not a V6 but offered quite a bit of torque for a 4 banger.  I must say that the ride if definitely better and much smoother than that of the Taurus. The engine was a little more noisy than the V6 I was used to but not too bad.  I chose a ES model that had the Infinity CD stereo system w/7 speakers.  It produced some pretty impressive dB's.  I really liked the power moonroof and 15" aluminum wheels.  About an hour after I had test driven the car, my buddy called me and told me that he could work the deal and only change my payment by $11 thanks to the $4000 Mitsubishi rebates.  I am pleased with my purchase and really like the ride much better than the Taurus.  I have since added the 5200K Xenon HID headlights which make a huge difference.  I have also added the 6000K Xenon foglamp replacements that also help light up the night.  Highly recommended.  I also must give kudos to the speed-sensitive wipers.  A great mid-size sedan with a compact price.  Great gas mileage (25/28).  Also great warranty coverage with roadside assistance.  I highly recommend.
