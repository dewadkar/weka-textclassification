            How many cars on the road can really make 0-60 in less than 6 seconds?  Not many!  Chevrolet combined the Corvette LS-1 V8 engine in a sleek body style with a nice and tight suspension.   I regularly dust the local pocket rocket Japanese pretend sports cars around my town.

You have to learn to live with this car.  First, you have to accept that it has a very useless back seat and a very limited trunk. Secondly, for drivers new to high performance rear-wheel drive cars, you may want to get a lesson somewhere before adventuring in this car.  After you get the hang of the cornering and quit swinging the tail around, you can have incredible fun in this car. 

Most people buy the automatic transmission.  I chose the automatic transmission since the traffic in my town in unbearable, and I have never been disappointed with the performance.  It's worth spending the money for the top stereo like I did. The standard stereo is not that great.  I'm also happy I bought the t-tops which easily store in the little trunk and provide open top driving when wanted. The t-tops are tinted glass but create a bright interior during daytime driving.
