            When I was a midshipman at the US Naval Academy, a local Dodge dealership brought a Durango to the school for everyone to look at.  It was grouped with several other cars - one Porsche and two BMWs - but the big, red Durango snagged a lot of attention.  At that moment, I myself, fell in love with the big animal.  I had to have one.  A year later, God willing, I did.
    The Durango was an excellent party car for those late night runs back to school - it seats eight comfortably (with the additional third seat installed) and mine has been packed at times with as many as thirteen.  The storage space in the Durango is unrivaled, with or without the second and third seats laid down flat.  It's also respected on the highways by larger vehicles, simply because of its size, and the smaller, quicker cars, are forced to watch it.  Driving the Durango is like being in charge of your own personal tank - but it's a quick tank.  The V8 provides a lot of punch when it's needed.  My car is equipped without four wheel drive, simply because I didn't need it.  That being said, I am happy to be the owner of a Dodge Durango and I personally love the car.  
    What is there to hate?  DO NOT BUY THIS SUV IF YOU ARE STRAPPED FOR GAS MONEY.  That is all that can be said about that.  With the current level of gas prices, this car will suck your wallet dry.  I would buy this car if you want a SUV that can get dirty while still being classy.  If you want a SUV only to show off at the office, go get a Navigator.  If you want a SUV to drive around off road in the mountains, go buy a Rodeo.  If you want a SUV that can do both, pick one of these monsters up.  It won't disappoint.  Someone may call you a soccer mom in one, but that will only be before you run them off the road.<br><br>
