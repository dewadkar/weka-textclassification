            My husband bought me a Toyota Tacoma for Christmas about 4 years ago.  This is a great little truck.  I was never much of a truck fan.  I guess it was the bigger style truck that I didn't really like.  Too big for me to maneuver.  But, when I got behind the wheel of my Tacoma, my thoughts on trucks changed.  

This truck handles beautifully.  We have the V6 so it has great pick up and go!  It's an automatic, which is the only way I will have a car/truck now.  (I use to own manuals)  Power steering so it handles turns perfect.  It's small, which is something I really like in a car/truck.  

The truck is now 4 years old and we have yet to have a problem with it (knock on wood).  Everything still works and it runs as if it were brand new.  But it's a Toyota, I wouldn't expect anything less.  

I now drive my Ford Windstar (see my opinion on that), but the Tacoma is driven everyday by my husband!  You can not go wrong with a Toyota vehicle!<br><br>
