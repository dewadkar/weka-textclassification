            This car is one of the best out on the market. This car is quite pricey, about $75,000 for me, but it is well worth it. Mercedes-Benz S-420 is very roomy and gives you enough room to sleep in it. This car was made to get your from one point to another as safely as possible. This car has incredible sound capabilities with its six CD changer, its tape player, or the radio. With many neat, little features such as the adjustable seat, this car can fit your needs and make driving a bit less of a pain. All of the controls in the car are within the driver's grasp giving you more time to keep your eyes on the road. I have had the car since 1998 and have had only had to take it to the dealer three times for minor check ups and problems.

The car is very comfortable and makes very little sound if at any unless there is something wrong. If you are looking for room in the trunk, the Mercedes-Benz S-420 has it. The trunk gives you plenty of room, even when you are camping or have to put the kids in the trunk for never being quiet. I suggest not putting anyone or anything in the trunk that needs air to survive because, when the trunk shuts, it is airtight.

This car has a very nice, quiet engine yet is still very powerful. It has incredible acceleration and can reach high speeds if necessary. The downside to the car is that it is very heavy and eats up gas quite quickly. The car can hold up to about 25 gallons, so you will not have to go to the gas station too often. This car gives the driver a very smooth ride even on rough ground because of its complex suspension system.

This car is really for people who want a safe, smooth ride to their destination. Mercedes-Benz S-420 is a very expensive family car, so it is not for all. If you want a safe, luxurious car, Mercedes-Benz S-420 is for you.
