            I bought a 1997 Plymouth Voyager Grand new thinking that it would be the greatest family van ever.  Well, I've replaced the battery, the front brakes (after only 1 year), all four tires, the wipers mysteriously come on by themselves, and just 11 days before Christmas, I had to replace the transmission to the hefty price tag of $1,927.77.  I found two auto mechanics, one of whom worked for Chrysler for two years, who swore Chrysler's transmissions are historically bad.  I initially contacted Chrysler to find out if there's anything I could do, and they said sorry, but no!  I called back two weeks later to complain higher, and with a curt response of &quot;there is no one higher to complain to other than customer service&quot; they hung up on me.<br><br>
