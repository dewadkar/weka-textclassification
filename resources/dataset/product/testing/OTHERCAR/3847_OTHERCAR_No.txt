                If your thinking about buying an oldsmobile Achieva (DON'T)!!!!
Three close friends of mine recently purchased Achieva's one of which is my girlfriend.  Ever since then the same things have been going wrong with them.  Let's start with the motor, all three have the quad 4.  All three by coincidence blew a head gasket at about 70,000 miles.  I've also had to change my girlfriends struts and alternator.  Next we can talk about the interior.  The door panels don't like to stay on the doors and the arm rests break off in both the front and back seats!  Not to mention the windows are constantly falling off their tracks.  I feel the Achieva is the worst olds vehicle i've ever traveled in.  If your planning on buying an Achieva please check for the problems I have mentioned, it will save you a lot of head aches!!!!!!   <br><br>
