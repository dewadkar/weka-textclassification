            I bought this car for a few reasons:  It was cute, it had a sunroof, it was an automatic, and it didn't have that many miles on it.

When I bought it, it was used, and only 1 year old.  I will have paid close to $18,000.  The previous owner was a non-smoking female who only drove it once in awhile, and then traded it in for a new Cabrio. So the overall condition was new. It had some extras, such as a motorized sunroof, cruise control, automatic transmission, and air conditioning. There were about 12,000 miles on it when it was purchased in May of 1996.  I just broke 80,000 miles the other day.

Okay, negatives first:
We had to have the back seat locks replaced just a few months after purchasing, and the lock to the driver's side door COMPLETELY came out one day.  Weirdest thing I ever saw.  These problems were fixed, under warranty without much circumstance.  The seatbelts do this weird thing where they lock up sometimes, and there's NO slack.  We've had the gear shift freeze completely and refuse to budge from park to drive on numerous occasions.  The alarm sometimes goes off for no reason whatsoever when the trunk is being closed. There is no glove box. The cup holders were designed by a person who wasn't thinking very clearly, because they are too small for anything but a can of Coke, and they are a a strange angle. The catalytic converter matrix completely melted when we were in San Francisco one Sunday, and we had to have it replaced at the expense of $1200.00 come to find out later that it was completely covered under warranty, and we weren't told that.  

On the positive side, besides what's mentioned above, we haven't had all that much need replacing at our expense except for mostly annoying little things such as the seatbelt covering on the passenger's side coming off, the window handle of the driver side popping off, and other minor bothers.  We've had maybe 2 tune-ups, and 12 oil changes total.  So for the most part, it's a pretty low maintenance vehicle, and fun to zip down the freeway at 90 with the sunroof open.  We've travelled to San Francisco more times than I can count, to Tahoe 6 times, Las Vegas twice, and all over central California.  We're driving it down to LA this weekend. So, it's a good car for road trips, as long as there's no one in the back seat and you can push the seat back. All in all, it's a great car. Also, the factory speaker system is very good, although I bought another stereo.  Another year and it will be all mine, and paid off.  Hope it lasts that long! :)
