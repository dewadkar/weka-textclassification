            One afternoon last June, my husband and I decided to stop in to look at new cars. We had NO intentions of purchasing a new car, we just wanted to look and see what new cars were on the lot. After oohing and ahhing over Cadillac new SUV (if we bought one  we'd have to LIVE in it!) we wandered over to see what other cars were on the show room floor. Hmmmm, what's this? Oh, the new 2000 Impala? Hmmm, sure sits nice! Can we test drive it? The rest is history! We had our new Impala sedan before the dealership closed! I love the auto door locks. And the best thing is the headlights turn on by themselves! (Can you tell I'd been driving a 10 year old van?) All these new gadgets to get used to! There could be a little more leg room in the rear but I never sit back there so it doesn't cause me any problems &lt;G&gt; I feel very safe driving my new Impala 2000. GM has a winner!<br><br>
