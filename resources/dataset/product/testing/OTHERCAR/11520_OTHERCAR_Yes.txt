            First off, let me state for the record that I'm not a gearhead.  I'm a software developer, and demand virtual zero maintenance out of my vehicles, like most lazy Americans.

That said, my Maxima has been my dream car.  I purchased it in Chicago in April of 2001 at a local clearance event for about $22k.

My Maxima is the SE model with cloth seats, 16" wheels and Automatic transmission.  

To give you an idea of what I've been through before, here is the list of cars I've owned previously:

1984 Dodge Aires
1982 AMC Eagle
1983 Toyota Celica
1986 Ford Taurus
1996 Dodge Neon
1999 Pontiac Grand Am

As you can imagine, I've been pretty floored by the Maxima.  All of the positive reviews I've read have been justified.  The vehicle is very well mannered, but obviously powerful.   The build quality is outstanding - after years of shoddily built American cars, the difference to me is immeasurable.  No rattling at high speeds!  I suppose you DO get what you pay for.

Mileage has been pretty good.  I've averaged about 21 mpg in mixed suburban driving, and about 26-27 on long road trips.

I've driven it to or from Chicago to Dallas (900 miles) three different times, and it's been a dream each time.  

The finish on the paint is very nice.  The trunk is very roomy, and the seats fold down 60/40.  The opening is not overly large, however.


My biggest problem with the Maxima is probably that the styling isn't quite as aggressive as I would have liked (I'm 27).  I have no complaints, but upon seeing the 2002 Altima (which has more space and a larger engine than my 2001 SE, and is sportier), I started to drool.  I don't think I would have gone for the Maxima if the Altima had been around when I was shopping, but I can't honestly say I regret my purchase.  I'll be able to drive my Maxima for a good ten years, I'm sure, and it'll probably be the car I use when I start to raise a family, without feeling like an old man at all.

<b>Update - April 2003</b>
2 years old, 31000 miles, and still not a single problem.  I love my Maxima!
