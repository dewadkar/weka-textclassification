            Never knew what i was getting myself into when i bought this car. I never knew it would be so much fun!  This sports car is nothing short of breathtaking.  

The first night i brought it home it was raining like crazy so i quickly found out that this car likes to bring the back end around, so it takes some learning in driving if you haven't driven a rear wheel vehicle like this, as it will fishtail if not powered correctly.   

When the roads are dry, nothing stands in the way of this car... it is super fast, comfortable and stunning... the engine revs to 9000 rpm and you feel every single rotation.  The low end torque isn't as good as i thought it would be, but once you get to a rolling start this car rocks... time to feel some g-force baby!  This is a race car on rails...  at least it feels that way when cornering!

The only real con i have about the car is that it doesn't have an electronic unlock for the passenger side door... so whenever you let someone in or have to let someone out at night when they can't find the door lock, you have to reach over and unlock it manually. It does come with a remote key so you can lock/unlock both doors electronically when you have the key fob out of the ignition... 
There is no glove compartment in the traditional area... it is in the center console... and is kind of a stretch to reach into it... But sports cars aren't supposed to be luxurious... it's about performance.

The top folds down electronically in about 5 seconds!  wow!  My mother has a Lexus SC430 and that takes about 25 seconds... so good-luck trying to put it down at a stoplight... Not so with the s2000, unlatch the top from the inside (very easy) and hit the drop top button and it's down in a beat. 

You're gonna get a lot of stares driving this car, a lot of envious people will hate you because you have this car and they don't... hehe

Once you take home your s2000 head over to s2ki.com or s2kca.com to join the s2000 community and chat with all the other s2k owners!  My handle there is chicopaparazzi, so make sure to say hi :)
