            Ahh, the Land Cruiser. This is a car I wanted all my life. I have a 1976 Land Cruiser, which gave me great experiences of my life, and I thought it was time to get a newer model. I decided to get the 1994 model, since it has a bigger engine than the 1991-1992 models, yet the same body style. I was not disappointed in this purchase. Everything I expectation and then some for this car was met. I was a happy kid in a candy store and still am. 
I will keep this car until it dies. This is the type of car which can do anything and go anywhere. Even under rain, sleet, or snow this car will keep on tickin. I don't have to worry where this car can go, or if I can drive it under certain weather conditions. It has lots of interior room which can accommodate almost anything which you wish to carry.  Even though this car weighs a hefty amount, its V-8 engine can make this car move. It takes time to get the Land Cruiser moving, but then again it's not a sports car.
The negative aspects about this vehicle is its gas mileage. Its pretty bad at 14MPG, but you can't have everything. Part and maintenance are also pretty pricey but if you pay attention to this car, she will not fail you. When driving on the highway or urban roads, the Land Cruiser is fairly quiet car, comfortable, and handles well for its size. 
All and all, I'm a happy camper. I recommend this car to all off-road enthusiasts, since it can go anywhere or to anyone who appreciates a well built SUV, by giving you a sense of security.
