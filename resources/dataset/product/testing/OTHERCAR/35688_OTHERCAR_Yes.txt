            Ok! This car is boring! But wonderful!
I have had the car since 1995, and after 5 years I have never had an ounce of trouble with it.
I have not lost an ounce of performance since day one.
The mileage is great! Replacing tires is cheap! I can replace all four for less than $100.
Mine is a standard 4 speed. The clutch still seems great!

There are some cons though:
1) The car is noisy. Could use more insulation.
2) Not the best car on icy roads. Keep a full tank in Winter.
3) Not much of an instrument panel. I actually like this. Not cluttered.

All you need to do is keep up with the maintenance, and you will have a trouble free car.
I consider this car free once it's paid for.

I would love a fancier, sportier car, but when you care about money,
there is NO way I am going back to car payments!

I will vote for relatively quite ride, since nothing squeaks, just road noise.<br><br>
