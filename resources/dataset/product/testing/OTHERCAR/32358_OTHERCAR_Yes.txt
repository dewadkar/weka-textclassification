            I purchased this car new in August 1995. It is a black 1995 Jetta GLS sedan, 5-speed. I had a 1986 Jetta that I had also purchased new, and was very favorably disposed towards another Jetta. My car came standard with power sunroof, heated front seats, cruise, allow wheels, power windows, good stereo with 4 tweeters and 4 mid-range speakers,  etc. It was very well equipped at $17,450 sticker; I paid a bit less than $16,000 for it. I currently have 81,000 miles on the car. I average 30 mpg almost no matter what I do - I generally do a mix of highway and around-town driving. In late 1997 I had the opportunity to test it's strength as I t-boned a Dodge Intrepid. Airbags deployed, there was $13,000 worth of damage to my front end - but the front doors opened, there was no unibody bending or twisting, basically just (a lot) of sheet-metal damage - oh, and $3000 to replace the airbags! The only option I wish I had gotten was ABS. 

Likes: handling is superb, styling has grown on me, mid-to-high-speed acceleration, gas mileage, solidity, features, seats, trunk size (wow!), fit and finish (the trunk is beautifully carpeted), value, overall quality, premium stereo (I added a CD changer to mine last year, sounds great, and is controlled by the standard radio so no additional controls were needed).

Dislikes: car is very underpowered with 115 hp, but the gearing is good, so you get good acceleration once you're moving, drivers-side door rub strip won't stay on, could use just a pinch more room in the rear, oh, and a bit more power, did I mention that?!

This car would make an excellent used car / first car for teenagers. Not enough power to get them into trouble, still looks stylish, lots of customizing options, safe and reliable.
