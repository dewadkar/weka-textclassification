            This camera is so easy - you &quot;gotta&quot; love it!  It has a screen that shows you the picture you just took, as well as a play option that lets you view your pictures right from the camera.

The pictures are stored on a computer disk that works with a PC or an iMac. I have one of each so this camera is perfect.  The pictures are good quality, but you can pick from three different quality settings.  There is even an e-mail setting that allows you to send pictures that do not take up a lot of space, or keep you waiting while they down load. There is a zoom feature that helps you take pictures of subjects that are far away as well as a play back feature that lets you look at a menu of pictures right after you take them!  You can also adjust for brightness, and the camera comes with a built in flash.

I used my camera all summer to send pictures of my daughter to family members.  They LOVED receiving e-mail from me.  Now I take my Sony Mavica with me instead of my regular camera, because I have my pictures immediatly!  

If the above reasons are not enough, here are two more reasons to buy this camera: 1) It is easy enough for children in my second grade classroom to use, and 2) my not so techy dad bought one too, and loves it!<br><br>
