            I used to think that BMWs were over-rated.  This car has me completely converted.  It is 3.5 years old, has done over 55,000 enjoyable miles. Only problem was the driver window motor got tired and was replaced under warranty.  This particular car is loaded with everything I could specify except auto transmission.  So it has the full sport and comfort equipment, with sport wheels and suspension, leather seats, computer, sun roof, CD changer and so on.

The handling of this car is very, very good.  It takes sweeping curves at high G forces with little or no fuss. The steering feel is superb, and brakes absolutely dependable.  ABS is super, and the traction control works extremely well.  In winter in Massachusetts, I swap the wide summer tires (and wheels) over for Blizzacs, and never worry about lack of front or four wheel drive on snowy or icy roads.  I have owned front and all wheel drive cars in the past and am not missing them.

The computer is a blessing.  I really like the time to destination function.  It has two fuel consumption tallies, one of which I have never reset and shows 26.4 MPG.

I thought I would miss having electric seats, but the manual controls for fore-aft, up-down, and backrest movement are simple, quick and easy.  I am 6' 2" and have adequate space.  If the budget will stretch to it, the next BMW will be a 5 series for a bit more room, but that is a matter of taste.  I fit just fine.

The heated seats are excellent.  The ability to fold down the back seats offsets the somewhat limited space in the trunk, and makes the car a great skiier's car.

I like the cruise control lever implementation, which gives the ability to release the control without forgetting the chosen speed.  It is conveniently placed on a stalk to the right of the steering wheel.

Finally, I like the BMW approach to service. They look after me and the car well, and I feel even happier about my BMW after it has been serviced than before.  (The reverse is true with my other car.)
