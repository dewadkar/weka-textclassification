            Five months ago, my dad shook me out of my bed. He frantically yelled, "Look at the car!"

So I hastilly put on my slippers and slumped my way toward our Cherokee. <i> Nothing unusual </i> I thought, as I looked at it from the passenger side. 

However, once I made my way to the driver side, I noticed a messy scrape of what was once the keyhole. The door opened very easily. That means the bastard made his way in. Lo and behold, the ignition was completely drilled out.

Having lived for 12 years in the mean streets of Jersey City and moving to the quiet suburbs 3 years ago, my parents never thought to be the victims of car theft. Panic set in. The insurance company gave us hell (not a surprise for NJ residents.) It took 3 weeks and $1,100 of our own funds to get everything back to normal again.

In NJ, the Cherokee ranks as one of the highest stolen vehicles in the state. Because this model is discontinued and parts are in huge demand, you can bet that other states will be affected. "Chop shoppers" love to steal these things for parts. 

What does all of this have to do with owning a Jeep? Well, if you don't want to become an easy victim of car theft, then avoid this car.

You're not missing much anyway. Sure it's quite an eye candy; its hard, angular lines give it an edgy look. But the performance really sucks.

The six cylinder engine lacks power. Your body doesn't get pressed against the seat when you floor it. 

The drivetrain is quirky. The car jerks and grinds while traveling at slow speeds on four-wheel drive mode. The drivetrain lever almost gets as much usage as the shifter!

The brakes... Don't even get me started here. They just don't work in bad weather. The pedal is already stiff, but depressing them in the rain can be a hairy experience. Learn how to compensate for lockups before you venture out in bad weather.

I really wanted to like this vehicle, but my family and I have had too many negative experiences with the jeep. This is a compelling example of a car having lots of style, yet very little substance.
