            Being in the market to purchase several digital cameras, I was looking to purchase the easiest to use and most affordable camera for our employees. Not everyone is a whiz, so our main requirements were: 1- Ease of use, 2- cost & 3- quality.

This digital camera met all 3 requirements and more. It is very easy to use and comes with great instructions, quite affordable compared to other cameras out on the market offering similar functions and quality. We were actually impressed by the option of having several images "Stitched" together with the bundled software, allowing us to be able to obtain larger pictures with no quality degradation.

We finally ended up purchasing 5 of these cameras for our office!

One down side would be the battery housing case, the little door has broken on 2 of our cameras and the guarantee did not cover this we were told, but was replaced within a  matter of a couple of days for a minimal cost. Keep in mind we use these cameras for business use and they are used day in day out and are subjected to more abuse then the average amateur photographer.

Overall, we are very satisfied and would buy this camera again if were in need of one!
