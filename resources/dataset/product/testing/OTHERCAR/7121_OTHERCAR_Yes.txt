            This definitly a must buy car for all those people out there who want a nice, sleek car that can pull some amazing speed.
My neighbor has a used one that he got from a family friend and let me tell you on those chances he actully can pull himself away from it long enough to give in to my constant bugging to drive it I have some of the best fun of my life. Rolling with the top down along the freeway with the music playing and the setting sun is like a scene from the movies and definitly reason enough to buy the car in the first place. But for all you speed demons out there it can also pull 140
plus miles an hour. But please remember dont do it with the top down because thats an easy way to catch a couple bugs for dinner. Not only does this car have style and speed but it can corner well at high speeds also. The only bad thing I find about the convertible is that it tends to fog up quickly in the morning if you live in a cooler climate like NJ as I do. This car is a must buy for sure. Oh and dont worry about it over heating or breaking down. Me and my neighbor have put this car though it paces all right and it still runs as good as the day he got it. <br><br>
