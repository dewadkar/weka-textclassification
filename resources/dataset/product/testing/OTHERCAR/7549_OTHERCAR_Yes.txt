            It was always my dream to own a hummer.  I wanted it so bad ever since i was a kid, and recently I finally got one.  It's difficult to own and maintenance, but is well worth it.

Features--

Pros--

Huge tires-  These tires are bigger than my 7 year old son.  They are huge and well worth it.  Even though a set ends up costing over $500, its well worth it.  When i took this beast up to the mountains, I was amazed at the stuff it could do.  It was driving over 5 foot rocks like there was nothing there.  This thing was driving through 4 feet of water with ease like it would on the road.  It is definately a vehicle for the offroad.  No wonder they use them in the army.  

Tough- You can't imagine how tough these things are.  I smacked into a tree head on at 70 mph and there was barely a scratch on it.  I mean just imagine if that was a car.  Sure the other people wouldn't be lucky to hit you, but you are almost garunteed survival.  With the hge tires, you'd probably end up running them over like that 5 foot rock.  It's just about the safest little beast you can ride.  It's very intimidating to see this monterous beast driving up to you with its huge form.  It has a the same width of an 18-wheeler and almost as tall.  Nobody'll get in your way with this thing.

Fame- Whenever I go anywhere with my hummer, even just a small trip to the grocery store, there is almost always somebody there to ask about my hummer.  It'll make you feel like you're a star, when somebody comes up and asks questions and says that they wish they had a hummer.  If you don't like being popular, don'tget a hummer.  But who wouldn't love the envy of others.  

Surprisingly quiet- I once rode in a 1992 hummer at my uncles house as a child, and I remembered the huge car, huge tires, and huge sound.  It was like driving one of  those old submarines where you go deaf after two hours.  The radio had to be up all the way just to hear it.  But now, somehow they kept that same ominous look and feel, without that apocalyptic sound.  You can take a nice quiet drive down the road at night without waking up the whole neigborhood.  

2,000 pund winch-  There is an option to get a 2,000 pound winch and i would suggest getting it.  Now you can put your hummer to work.  Drag entire trees into your campsite and other things on that subject.  I once tried to use my hummer for water-skiiing in a small lake (I don't suggest this).  But still, it's great to have it.  You can do alkmost anything with the hummer if you get this.

Cons-

Gas Guzzler- As much as I wanted a hummer as a child, I did research and found out what it was really like.  It gets horriblegas mileage and uses hard to find deisel.  They give you a huge tank for a reason.  You can hold about 45 gallons in the  Primary and Auxillary tanks, so it is well eqipped to last about 500-1000 miles.  It's much better on the highway because you can control the road with the fear of others and you don't have to slow down often.  And in the woods its a powerhouse, but I would neer use my hummer to commute.  I made a pact with myself never to own a regualar car, so I drive a Saturn VUE most places.  It gets good gas mileage, but that's off the subject.  Don't get the hummer as your primary vehicle, because you'll be spending hundreds on gas.  Every week or so, I do take my hummer to work just to show it off, but it's just not healthy to take it every day.

Sluggish steering- I found it to have some slow steering to no surprise.  I have gotten used to it but in the beginning, I couldn't take it anywhere.  It really is a bit difficult to go most places until you get used to the way it works and it is not fun when you're waiting.  But it is well worth it because once you get used to it, It's a huge, mean, fighting machine.

Space- It takes up a lot of space.  I can't fit it in my garage, but it doesn't get dirty in the rain.  And you can't park it at those parking garges with height limits most of the time, and sometimes you have to hang out of the wondow to pick up your food at the drive-through, but the size pays off.  If you're going to meet someone, they can't miss a huge green hummer.  And it strikes fear on the hearts of millions, but the size does limit it places to go.  Another reason I prefer my VUE.
