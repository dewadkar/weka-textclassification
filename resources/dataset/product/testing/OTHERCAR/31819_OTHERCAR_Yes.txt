            When someone in the house had a skunk-dodging incident that caused a fatality to our 1997 Civic, we needed to find a replacement vehicle.  Instead of buying a used '97 Civic, or buying a different make/model altogether we decided to grab a 2000 Civic.

We got the package with 5-speed manual transmission, and CD player.  Of course it also comes with the AM/FM radio, electric locks/windows, power steering, blah blah.

It's been just a reliable as the previous vehicle, and I'm convinced that it's safe enough for my family, considering how the '97 Civic didn't simply crumble after being rolled in the ditch.

We haven't had any parts falling off, or features stop working.  About the only problem is the slow leak in one of the tires.  But I have a feeling that's something you'd occasionally run across regardless of auto make/model.  Plus, since I'm kinda bright, I know how to put air in the tires. (Well, ok, i took a remedial course)

The car runs smooth and quiet, and can comfortably fit 4 people (five if you put 2 small ones in the back with one non-small person).  I'm 6' tall and am comfortable sitting in any of the seats.  

With respect to other space, the trunk is somewhat spacious, and the back seat drops down and opens into the trunk for larger cargo hauling capability (larger, in the mid-size car sense, not ton-truck context).

Hopefully we'll never find out if our skunk-dodging skills have improved, but if we do, and we fail that test, we'd consider buying another 2000 Civic if our finances wouldn't allow us to get whatever the current year Civic model would be.
