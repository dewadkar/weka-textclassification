            I own an 89' chevy s10 blazer which for it's age still drives like a dream.  However it is my fathers new 98' four door, beautiful black chevy blazer that surpasses all others.  It drives like a dream. You almost feel like you are in the comfort of a recliner in your house moving to your destination.  
I have been privileged to take this vehicle out on several excursions.  I went on a weekend trip with my dads car earlier this winter. The roads were really bad but the truck handle with ease.  It snowed all weekend and I was plowed in.  
I turned on the car put the four wheel drive on and drove right through the snow like butter.  The vehicle is so spacious with a very comfortable interior.  There are many compartments to hold items ranging from glasses, the garage door opener, and even a change holder.  
This is a luxury truck with room to fit four people very comfortably and a space in the back to hold a weeks worth of groceries and more.  If your asking if this vehicle is for you well I feel it is for everyone.  
If your a parent and want your children to be safe, well this is the vehicle to buy.  If you have children going away to school this is the vehicle to buy them.  It's simply the best  and I cannot wait until I can afford to buy the next model.  Chevy has won my heart for life with this vehicle.<br><br>
