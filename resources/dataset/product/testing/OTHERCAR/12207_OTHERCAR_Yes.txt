            i bought a buick park avenue mainly for the looks... but after purchasing it, and driving it.. i am glad that it is the car i choose.. it rides so comfortable. i love the looks and the way it handles.. the car has get up.. and if you are not careful you just might get a speeding ticket. you really can't tell how fast you are going unless you look at the speedometer it rides that smooth... the only thing i don't like about it is that it don't have a button on it where i can stay in the house on cold morning and start it up...i think everyone should have or drive a buick park ave.  well maybe not the hotrod kids... they would just tear it up<br><br>
