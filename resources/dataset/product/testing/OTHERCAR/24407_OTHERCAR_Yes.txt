            The 1992 Buick LeSabre is one I have had a hard time replacing.  I know I will get another Buick.  I am so fond of this car I don't believe this many years have gone by without the need for a new car.  The way it feels so safe on the road the major plus.  It's big without feeling like a large car that is hard to drive.  This is what makes it feel so roomy inside.  It's a comfortable six passenger if a couple of people are children.  The cloth interior makes it feel warm, but it has a great heater.  
The way it holds the road and is great on turns are part of that solid feeling.  Being low to the ground makes it easier to get in and out of and now that the snow storms have been few, we have not gotten stuck.
This is a great car for the student driver.  Learning on this car was good for me and my daughter.  I felt the safety that if we got hit we would be all right.  We did good because the car never hesitated.
The repairs have been minor thus far but I am looking forward to getting another buick.<br><br>
