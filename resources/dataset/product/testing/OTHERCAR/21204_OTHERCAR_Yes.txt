            MY HISTORY

I blindly purchased my first digital camera, a Kodak, four years ago by ordering one off the internet because my rural town didn't have any digital cameras in stock.  I choose the Kodak DC 240 1.3 MP camera.  I was thrilled with it.  When I showed people my photos, they raved they looked like magazine photos.  I thought I was a good photographer -- amazingly though -- it wasn't me -- it was all Kodak.  Now, having tried many other cameras -- I know I was blessed when I blindly chose Kodak for many reasons.

In my pursuit to buy a new camera, I blindly sent away for another Kodak, except this time I got a bomb.  I bought the DX3900, and it was so bad -- I immediately put it up for auction on e-bay.  I was so disappointed I can't even begin to say.  

Next I bought the latest and greatest Nikon 5000 camera.  I set it up to "point and shoot" and WHOA...I was so disappointed!  Mind you this is a top-of-the-line SLR 5MP camera with an 8X optical zoom -- but it just didn't take quality photos in point and shoot mode.  The shutter lag was INSANE. I often missed my subjects it was sooo slow.  The lens hunted around in blur mode half the time. I couldn't take it.  My old Kodak was QUICK!  For the money ($1100), I felt robbed. I quickly returned it.

Next, I bought the Minolta S404.  I tried it out at Target and thankfully, the shutter lag was more tolerable and the hunting mode -- while still present -- wasn't quite as bad as the Nikon. I figured it was less complex and might be able to meet my needs.  I bought it and took it home.  Sadly, all the photos were dark.  There was no software worth speaking about either with the Minolta.  They seemed to have taken shortcuts compared to Kodak.  I was paying more and getting less.  None of the photos looked like the magazine photos I used to know with my Kodak. The color was pathetic -- even after using their software to improve it. Upon reviewing photos at several sites like www.imaging-resources -- I realized the Minotla was a flawed camera too.  It didn't hold a candle to my old Kodak.  I immediately returned it.

THE KODAK DX4330

Ahh...and then I saw the newest camera come out by Kodak on Kodak's site and I had to try it.  I ran out to Circuit City and tried it.  The shutter lag and auto focus hunting are my biggest complaint with most cameras.  They are sooooo slow!  When I tried the new Kodak DX4330 -- WOW -- it was great -- like my old DC240.  I purchased it and took it home.  I was reserved but excited.

I quickly unwrapped it, and snapped a few photos.  I never even opened up the manual and I quickly and intuitively figured out how to download the photos via the USB cable provided.  This camera is great for anyone -- the learning curve is zero.  

The first pictures were SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!  SMASHINGLY beautiful and as my first friend who saw the first photo said, "They look like magazine photos!"  Yes, Kodak did it again.

I am not going to spend time reviewing the features of the camera.  You can do that by clicking on the "Specs" or by going to the manufacturers page.  I will tell you this is a 3.1 MP camera with little manual override features that competes with the best of them in quality, color and accuracy.  You can blow up photos to 11x14 with incredible quality.

I can take sunsets and get fabulous color (which the Minolta could not do no matter what the setting).  I can get great night shots outside with the porch light on...and I can take great photos indoors or outside (again the Minolta failed on the indoor shots).  You can also take fabulous macro shots -- again this camera beat the Minolta hands down.  I didn't test the Nikon on this.

The color is nearly perfect as well (again Minolta couldn't capture cherry red).  Take a photo and compare it to reality -- you'll be impressed.  Kodak also supplies some great software with it too which allows you to crop, color adjust, covert to black-n-white, balance light/dark, enhance, eliminate red-eye, etc. The software is slick -- quick and easy.

The camera is small, very light-weight and the 2 AA batteries last for 180 + shots using the flash and the review mode to see photos after they are taken.  The storage media is Secure Digital...so far... no complaints about that either.

The date stamp isn't the greatest as it is rather large and bright yellow -- but it is there if you want it.  There is no time-stamp.

The software which comes with the camera is pleasing.  It serves all my needs though I don't like the way Kodak makes you save photos to e-mail people.  I use another software to downsize the images.  You also can't rename them using Kodak's software which is a flaw -- but minor to live with.  

When you save photos to your hard drive, Kodak automatically files them in a folder with the date.  You can override this and create your own naming conventions.

The downloading via the USB is amazingly quick and very simple.  You can't mess it up.  It's all intuitive. You can see a little thumbnail of each photo being downloaded which is great.  Then when they are all downloaded, Kodak's software lets you view the photos in full-screen slideshow mode.

I recently blew up the *first photo* I took with this camera as it was that pleasing  -- to an 11 x 14 -- and it looks professional the quality that is good!

This is a must buy!!  If you are thinking about it -- don't!  Get one today.  You won't regret it if you are a novice or anyone who doesn't want to bother with all the old 35mm pre-sets.  The camera can easily fit into a purse and off you go to shoot.  I average about 400 photos a week now!  

There is some blue casting on brightly-lit shots -- its the only negative I have seen -- but compared to what I saw in other cameras -- I'll gladly keep it!

Happy Camera Hunting!
