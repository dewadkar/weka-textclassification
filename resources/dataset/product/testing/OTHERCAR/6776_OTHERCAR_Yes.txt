            I had bought my Plymouth Breeze brand new back in January, 1997.  After dealing with a lemon car for five years, namely a 1988 Ford Tempo, it was definitely time to unload that old clunker.

Before I went to my dealer to buy the Breeze, I sat in one on display at a shopping mall and fell in love with it.  I test drove it at my dealer (they have a test drive track in the lot) and then, I purchased it.

I was and continued to be impressed with the gas mileage and all that interior room.  While I was driving two of my co-workers up to a business function, one of them even joked that he had enough leg room to lay down right there (my driver seat is set all the way forward, he sat behind me).

I had to take the car back to the dealer three times in the course of the 3 year/30,000 mile warranty because the "check engine" light kept going on.  According to the mechanic, the diagnostic reading revealed each time the gas cap was loose, triggering the light to go on.  Naturally, I had to prove to the mechanic that I know how to close the gas cap tightly...I fill my own gas at self-serve stations.  Last summer the "check engine" light came on again....because of a blown oxygen sensor...a $150 repair.

Around time the 3 year/30,000 warranty was expiring, my oil did leak in the driveway, thanks to a cracked head gasket (the car had less than 40,000 miles on it at the time).  Thank goodness I had it repaired just before the warranty expired.

Since I had all the trouble with my old Ford Tempo, I bought this Plymouth Breeze without power windows or locks, one less thing to worry about if they break.  Whoever designed the car should have positioned the window cranks a bit higher on each door...you have to bend a bit just to roll your window.

Despite the setbacks as noted above, I plan to replace it when the car dies.
