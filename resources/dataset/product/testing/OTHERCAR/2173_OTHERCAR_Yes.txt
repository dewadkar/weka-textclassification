            We bought this car new in 1996 and have loved it from the day I brought it home.  I call it my &quot;other&quot; baby!

Actually my husband purchased the car and I had no idea since it was supposed to be a surprise.  I was right after we married, and since he had owned a car that I couldn't drive (manual transmission) he went and bought a new one just to be a nice guy!  I wasn't sure about the car at first, since it was my first &quot;new&quot; car I was a little nervous.

I've had the car for 4 years now and I LOVE it!  I have had NO problems with it mechanically, and I consider that outstanding for a car!  It drives nicely and there is plenty of room for my daughters carseat in the backseat.  We can comfortably fit 4 adults into the car which is also nice when you want to go out!  Trunk space is great, we can fit enough stuff to go to grandma and grandpa's for a whole WEEK in the trunk!


Also the gas milage is pretty good as well.  I must admit that this car has been well taken care of, which makes a big difference in a car.  Regular oil changes, and tire rotation ect, has helped everything to last longer!  However, I will say that in 4 years we've NEVER had to have the brakes done, or have anything other than regular matinance done on this car.  I plan to drive this car for a LONG time...<br><br>
