            I bought my Sable new back in April, 1999 during a special sale deal. I had just ordered my Mercury Mystique from the factory as no one could find the exact car I wanted on their lots nearby.  Then I saw the ad in the paper that week offering a lot of extras if you bought the highline model. It turned out to be only a couple hundred more than what I was going to pay for the Mystique, so why not?  I purchased a 1999 Mercury Sable LS Limited Edition that was ready to go on the lot, complete with custom- 2 tone leather seats (driver power), Premium sound, Moonroof, Automatic climate control, heated mirrors, power everything and the V6-DOHC (200 HP) engine. All for under $20,000! 

I am a large person and so is my boyfriend and there is plenty of room to be comfortable on any length trip. The ride is fairly smooth, though for me, the steering or the control of the vehicle is a little mushy. I am used to smaller cars and their turn-on-a-dime exactness.  The cabin is quiet and the 6 speaker sound is terrific! The trunk is huge; I was reaching for something that shifted forward and I FELL IN and needed assistance to get out! Really! 

After 15 months on the road and over 23000 miles on it (knock wood!) no visits for repairs or adjustments except for my usual maintenance. Overall, I am getting 20-23 MPG (depends on whether AC is on or not).<br><br>
