            This vehicle is a disappointing truck. It's big and heavy, but has tiny doors and a small luggage area. It has a tremendous V8 but accelerates slowly. It is expensive, but is as poorly designed and engineered as you can imagine. The car has many attempts at luxuries, but most are so uncomfortable/awkward to use that you don't want to use it. It has big windows but terrible visibility, particularly out of the rear and the side. It has big leather seats, but they are terribly uncomfortable, particularly the headrests. It has a spacious dashboard, but is so terribly designed that using anything, particularly the climate control, the switches behind the steering wheel, the window switches and the seat controls are completely illogical and poorly placed and far from the driver. It has a long travel suspension but is uncomfortable for highway travel. The rear doors are ridiculously small and even children have difficulty getting in. The rear door is designed for parking on the left side of the street, so when you open it, you must stand in traffic and close the door before you can bring your items to the sidewalk. The roofrack is so high off the ground that the only way to access it is from the ladder on the back door since the side doors are so small. The car has a short wheelbase and a huge turning radius. It may be good off road but who in the US would ever know that(suburban SUV lovers). The sound system has 13 speakers and still sounds off balance(too bass heavy...voices are incomprehensible). Overall, the car is a poor choice...consider the Volvo v70 XC for its ground clearance, handling, comfort, layout, power, comfort, control, value, and efficiency. Not to mention the car depreciates quickly.<br><br>
