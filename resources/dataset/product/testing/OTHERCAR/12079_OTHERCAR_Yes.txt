            My Grand Vitara is the 3rd 4 wheel drive vehicle I have owned. I was driving a 4 door sedan when I started looking at the small SUV's, and test drove the Honda CRV, Toyota RAV-4 and the Kia Sportage. First impressions are everything! I'm 5'8&quot; and a larger build, so the Toyota felt very cramped. The styling also was becoming dated (they had been out for several years). The Kia seemed nice, but I had difficulty with putting it into 4 wheel drive hi and lo, as the shifting lever was binding. (The sales person didn't seem too convincing that this new company could produce reliable cars.) The Honda was very nice, had plenty of space and was comfortable, but I didn't like that it was based off a Civic; it doesn't have a full frame and the 4 cylinder engine's power was inadequate.

Finally, the Suzuki. One test drive is all it took, but I still convinced my dealer into allowing me to take it home for the entire weekend. They also included the mud flaps, center armrest and floor mats in the price, and gave me a good trade-in price (with some haggling). I've owned the GV since February of last year, and I still enjoy driving it.

I've had it into the shop twice for repairs. First, the blower motor didn't work upon delivery, and the fan switch didn't work on all speeds. Next, the front oil seal went out. and the car leaked about a tablespoon of oil a day on my garage floor. The service person said that mine was the forth with this problem. There are two other problems with fixes, which include an occasional binding problem in the manual transmission, and a/c that drips on the floor after long driving in hot weather.

If you are a tall person, this vehicle will work out very well for you. It has alot of leg and head room. If you are fairly round in stature, the distance between the seat, the door and the console may be a little cramped. The back seats work well for children, but the leg room is a little tight for larger people, depending on where the front seats are positioned.

In the base price you get many luxuries including a/c, power windows, power/remote locks, delay wipers, cassette stereo, headlamps that turn on automatically, and an air filtration system. The V6 engine is responsive and quick, but I have read that the automatic version is a little sluggish. 

My biggest complaint with the vehicle is the quality of the interior plastic. It scratches easily, which turned my garage-sale find of the day (a Power Wheels Jeep) into an aggravating ordeal as the toy scratched the door panels easily. Suzuki does have accessories like a floor tray and a rear protector kit that will allow you to load large items without worry, so this would probably be a good investment. This is the main reason I would not rate this vehicle a 5.

I have 25k miles on this car, and I plan to keep it for many more.<br><br>
