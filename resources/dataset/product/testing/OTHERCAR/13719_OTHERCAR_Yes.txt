            I recently had the chance to test drive the new BMW 328Ci and I am impressed.
As I am from Germany I am probably one of  the few persons in the World who really had a chance to test the Coupe to its physical limits.

Taking it to the Autobahn from Munich to Salzburg was a real pleasure. The straight six cylinder engine  with its 193 horse powers is incredibly powerful and  superb  to drive.
Fast and smooth acceleration, low level of noise  even at the top speed of 242 km/h and the car sticks to the road. After arriving in Salzburg I wanted to test the 328i a bit further and decided to take the old windy Brennerstreet heading towards Chiusa. 
I can't tell you how much fun I had with this car. In any other car it would have been an exhausting and boring thing, but with the 328i Coupe I was virtually gliding through the bends - it was great.  

Well, you probably know by now how great the engine and the chassis of the new Coupe is but you sure would like to know something about the rest.

Ok, the Design is just beautiful. Elegant and sportive, yet powerful and unique.

I would  recommend to have the following extras:
- Leather.
- the Harman Kardon Audio System 
- the Xenon low beam headlights

But don't - !!!! - buy  the Automatic transmission. It's just so much fun to use the 6 gear manual transmission and why buy a sports car, when you drive like an old lady!

As for the price:
Priced at around 30000+ it might be an expensive car, but it is  worth it.
