            I purchased a 2000 Nissan Frontier Desert Runner XE V-6 2WD pickup, and I recommend it under most conditions.

I wanted a useful pickup truck to drive to work, and for some occasional hauling/towing on weekends.  I was shopping a price range (around $17,000) that put me between a totally loaded 4 cylinder and the Desert Runner V-6 package with less options.  Here's the difference.  The Desert Runner XE package gives you the clearance and suspension of the 4WD, but in a 2WD V-6.  It's an extended cab with "jump seats" behind the front bucket seats.  The jump seats will accommodate kids or small adults for short trips, but I use the area primarily for work "stuff." If you spend a couple thousand more, you can get the SE version, with all power packages/conveniences.

The V-6 shows good power/torque when coupled with the manual shift transmission.  The air conditioning is very good, even here in Arizona.  I average 17mpg regardless of conditions, which I believe is a little on the thirsty side.

If you're looking for a solid, inexpensive truck for some occasional "fun," consider this one!
