            Why spend your cash on an over-rated German car buy this one. American made car with spectacular engineering. Classy look with as many head lights as you can imagine. Great for road trips because of roooommy back seat, heated seats, big trunk space, and excelent gas mileage. If you drive an gas guggling SUV buy a 300M to lighten your load and give an easier and more pleasant ride. Let me just run through SOME of the features offered. Lighted passenger side fold down mirror, four CD changer, ten possible radio settings, AM FM radio, built in mechanical clock, illuminated dashboard, and sooooooooo on. Best type in it's class. for ages 16-99999999(if possible).<br><br>
