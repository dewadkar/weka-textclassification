                   I won mine in an online contest. It was so great to be among the winners. It really only cost me about 3.95 for faxing in my winners confirmation form. The shipping was even paid!! 

       When I received it via UPS I was totally clueless how to use a digital camera as I had never so much as touched one. It was very easy to learn how to use it though and super easy to use the software bundle that came with it to move my pictures from the camera to the computer. 

       Here is what I found when I opened the box:

          ePhoto CL30 digital camera 
          4 MB CompactFlash memory card
          4 cheap AA batteries 
          Digital Camera soft case
          Agfa PhotoWise software with PhotoGenie technology for
          managing, and enhancing digital images and Twain driver
          Serial cable for PC 
          Mac adapter cable 
          USB cable 
          Video cable 
          Help Manual

     Here is what your PC will need to operate this camera:

       PC System Requirements:

       50 MB of available hard disk space
       VGA monitor with at least 256 colors
       Microsoft Windows 95, 98 or NT
       Pentium processor or higher
       RS-232 9 pin port or USB port
       2x or faster CD-ROM
 
       Macintosh System Requirements:

       System 7.5.3 or higher
       Power PC processor
       Modem or USB port
             {Source: Quoted from box the camera came in.}

     It is very lightweight but seems to be built exceptionally well. The pictures it takes are fabulous. Here is a link to some pictures I took with this camera the day after getting it:

     I also like this camera because it is very attractive looking. I love the grey/silver color. I have seen other digital cameras that were just hideous and I would not be caught dead carrying. 

     I am also fascinated with the LCD display on the back of the camera. It reminded me of using my video camera. I don't know if all digital cameras come with one but the AGFA ePhoto CL30 does. I wish I had had this on many regular cameras too. It would have made it that much easier to get a good shot. 

     I was also very pleased that everything that was needed to start using the camera immediately was included right down to having batteries. 
I was taking pictures with it in seconds, and within minutes was loading them into my PC for editing. 

     I am sold on AGFA digital cameras and I doubt very highly I will ever buy another brand. If I get one as a gift though I will try it out.

     One drawback is (and I am sure it is like this with all digital cameras) that it eats batteries. I was able to get around that by buying an adapter so I can plug it in when I am not using it out of doors. The adapter is a bit expensive but you save money on batteries and it is more environment friendly than the batteries are.

     I wonder if there is a digital camera with a video camera type battery that will last so many hours? That would be really nice.

     The Agfa ePhoto CL30 may be my first digital camera but in my opinion, it is hands down the best one. I would buy this as a gift for anyone.
