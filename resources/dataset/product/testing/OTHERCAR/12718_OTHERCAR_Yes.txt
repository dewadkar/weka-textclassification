            History:  Previously owned a 99  Ford Taurus SE (The last year of the Oval Wonders), 98  Ford Windstar GL, 97 Pontiac Grand Am, and 90 Plymouth Acclaim.  This, by far, is the best car of all.  

I must first start with the looks.  WOW!  Fell in love at first glance.  Mine is black with the Sport Appearance Package.  This option does a couple of nifty tricks for the Impala.  One, fixes the look of those goofy tail lights.  Instead of having that gigantic red reflector all the way across the back of the car, it covers most of that with a color-coded device that only lets the actual tail light show, leaving only four reasonably sized round tail/brake/back-up lights.  Two, it gets rid of the cheesy looking fake-wood accents from the interior and replaces it with equally cheesy looking fake-graphite accents (Just a matter of taste!)  Finally, on the inside panels of the front doors there are classy-looking Impala trademarks embroidered into the leather trim.  (looks sharp)

Mechanically, the car (so far) has been trouble free (16000 miles).  The 200 HP 3800 V-6 is more than adequate, providing ample power to move this massive vehicle quickly enough to get you in trouble.  This engine is surprisingly efficient as well.  I get around 22 mpg in town and 28-32 mpg on the open road, depending on the urgency of my trip.  Too bad it doesn't stop as well as it goes.  The brakes require a lot of effort in a hard stop, but the four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes keeps the skidding to a minimum in slush and snow.  The LS package upgrades tunes up the suspension; a little more bumpy, but more responsive (It still seems a little "mushy" on the corners, very disappointing for such a sporty looking car).  Also, it upgrades the wheels to 16" alloy semi-cool aluminum (instead of hub-caps).  The Sport Appearance Package takes it a step further and takes the wheels off of a Monte Carlo (Chevy's "mock sports coupe") and puts on a pair of Low-Profile 60's that really tightens the appearance.  

The interior is VERY roomy, you get front buckets with the LS, and a bench in the Base model.  It is quiet enough at highway speeds, but at initial throttle, the big V-6 lets out a semi-imposing low roar.  The front seats are power operated and are heated.  Only the driver's side has adjustable lumbar support.  The leather seats are kind of hard (especially when its cold out), but the fact that you can adjust them to your liking and apply heat to your rump and lower back, kind of negates the cons.  The elevated back seat is adequate for three adults, gracious for two.  Other interior features include OnStar, Keyless remote entry, security/anti-theft system, 6-speaker AM/FM/Cassette/CD player with a kickin' amp mounted in the trunk, trip computer, full range of instruments (oil, battery, temp, fuel, tach and 140 mph spedometer, digital "PRNDL"and odometer/trip odometer), Spoiler, and many others to impress your friends.  

Some other cool design features that GM threw in include many appearance treatments that are Corvette-like (gauges, tail-lights--subtleties like that), a nostalgic ignition switch on the dash, instead of the steering column (takes a little getting used to), and a trunk the size of Carlsbad Caverns.  Sitting in the driver's seat at night with the lights on gives the effect of piloting a Leer jet.  Even the buttons on the doors and steering wheel are illuminated.  While the soft-green dash lights are easy on the eyes, the stereo and "PRNDL" lights are of a contrasting neon green, spicing it up a little.  The OnStar has a built in hands-free  satellite phone that you talk to while you drive.  The onboard computer system runs through the stereo, in fact EVERYTHING seem to run through the stereo.  With a few pushes of the stereo buttons you can reset the oil change monitor, air pressure monitor, set automatic features like the time-delay headlights, security system options, etc.  The RDS system in the stereo is a neat idea, but only a few radio stations use this technology which identifies the song on the radio, request line numbers, traffic info, so on, so forth.

There is only a few negatives.  The glove compartment is ridiculously small, however, they did add some rather largish chambers in the console which make up for that.  The moon roof doesn't appear to go all the way back.  That looks ugly only when the roof is open, though.  



The car loaded like mine is a little pricey ($29,500), but with the right haggling skills and rebates I picked mine up for for a little under $26,000 (and that includes a 6-year 75,000 mile extended warranty!)  This is Chevy's Flag-Ship.  You should sail one into your driveway!
