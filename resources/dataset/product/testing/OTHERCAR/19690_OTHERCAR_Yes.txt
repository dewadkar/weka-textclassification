            The 1999 Saturn SL2 is without a doubt a very good bargain for the kind of car you are getting.  This car is reasonably priced above all else and has something that I as a young person like; it is a family car but could carry off being a sporty car at the same time. The interior is nice and roomy, sitting five people comfortably.  The trunk is spacious and the backseats fold down for extra room if needed, which is great if you are packing for a long trip.  Added features such as an alarm system, cruise control, passenger side airbags, nice stereo system, and remote keyless entry are all great bonuses to this very economical car.  I am only twenty-three, and to me this is a great car for someone who wants a good deal, maybe just starting out on their own, and who wants a very smooth ride to and from work.  The car handles very smoothly,a great ride.  The contol of the car is great and there is even a feature that will kick in and take control of the wheels if you were ever to get into a skid or some sort of spinout.  That is a very nice safety touch.  Also, Saturns have extra side impact protection as well and, from what I have seen, they always test well when the National Insurance Institute does its testing of car crashes each year to determine the safest ones.  The only real problem I could see with the car is that the spare tire is a little tough to get out of its locked position in the trunk.  If you were in a tight spot and stranded, trying to unscrew it from its place after picking up the cumbersome trunk covering could be a bit annoying, but for a deal like this it is something that can be overlooked!  As far as gas milage goes, this type of Saturn gets about 350 miles for each tank.  I fully endorse this car to anyone who wants something reasonably priced, good looking, and easy to handle.
