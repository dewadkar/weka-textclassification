            I recently purchased a 2003 Toyota Celica GT and I absolutely love it.  I purchased it in Ontario, Canada so all comments are relative to that region and country.

I want to make it clear that I own this car and this review is based on my experiences.  Before buying it, I read too many reviews from auto magazines and websites by "experts" who really don't take into consideration real-life experiences.  Epinions is much, much better because many reviewers are owners, but even here there are test drivers who write massive reviews and extensively quote the car brochure they received at the dealer after their 10 minute test drive.  I don't think you can get a helpful opinion of a car like that.  For example, with my car, many reviewers complained that headroom was limited with the sunroof option.  That is true - if you leave the sunshade closed.  If you open it (leaving just the glass portion closed), which of course is what you would do if you have a sunroof, then you actually get more headroom than in a car without a sunroof.
Another typical comment I found absurd is when reviewers described the Celica consoles material as "cheap looking".  Really, can they tell by looking and touching a console how long it will last, or how expensive the material is?  If it is attractively styled and ergonomically correct, I really don't need any further opinions from a reviewer about how the PVC wasn't soft or textured enough for their liking.  For the record, I think all the Celica interior components to be of high quality, and based on other Toyota products, expect them to last forever as well.

OK, enough ranting.  I love this car!  I bought the GT with the base 140hp engine.  I almost didn't test drive this car because I thought a car with "only" 140hp couldn't be fun enough to drive, but I was completely wrong.  This car is perfectly balanced, nimble, and responsive.  The engine and transmission are perfectly mated.  The suspension is tight but not harsh.  There is no lean in corners or dive under braking.  The car is beautifully engineered and does not waste any money or weight on components that do not add to the driving experience.  There is no traction control, the wheels are 15" alloy when most sporty cars are moving to 16" and 17" for mainly cosmetic reasons (adding unsprung weight), the rear brakes are drums when even economy cars are often suited with rear disc (braking is outstanding on the Celica).  It doesn't have these things because it doesn't need them, all they would add is weight and cost.  I tested more expensive sports sedans, with a lot more power, and even though they could put me back in my seat under acceleration in a way the Celica can't, they weren't even 10% as fun to drive overall.
The Celica is designed from the ground up to be what it is, an outstanding sports coupe.  My favourite driving feature is the light weight of the car, which makes it feel so nimble and responsive.  There is simply no substitute for light weight.  You can add engine power and give a car a highly sophisticated suspension, controlled by computers, but all you are doing is making a heavier car pretend it is lighter and responsive than it really is.  Drive it and you'll see what I mean!
Of course, many of the things that make a sports coupe fun can be irritating if you don't expect them.  For example, there is a fair amount of wind, road, and engine noise with this car.  The back seats are nice, but lack adult-sized leg and head room.  Be prepared to hear complaints if you put adults back there, but they still fit.  My last car was a four door sedan, and when I bought it I thought it was necessary to have four doors and extra leg room for passengers, but after a few years I realized that no-one ever really sat back there and it was only about me and sometimes one other passenger in the front.  I decided this time not to waste money and weight on extra doors that I wouldn't use.  I would advise everyone to analyze their actual needs for a car before buying, and not to buy too much car "just in case" the need will come up some day.  You can sacrifice a lot of fun and/or money buying too much car!
The driver's position is great.  I love moving the seat back and stretching out my legs.  Visibility is fine thanks to big mirrors.  The windows are slightly tinted.  I got the "C" package (I think that only applies in Canada) which gave me a sunroof, cruise control and keyless entry (maybe some other stuff as well that I forget right now).  The sunroof really helps this car because with the thick B and C pillars, the interior can seem a bit closed without it.
Fuel economy is fantastic with this vehicle.  One of my favourite features is the headlights.  They are amazingly bright!  Not only do they illuminate everything in front, but they also cast some light to the sides as well, so you can see where you turning in the dark and watch out for hazards.
The five speed is great fun to drive.  The throws are very short and the clutch is also very short, so when you are "on it", you just need to flick your wrist and tap the clutch to change gears - feels great.  Unfortunately there have been a couple instances when I wasn't paying attention and reached for fourth but put it in second instead because the gates are so close.  What a horrible feeling!
The stereo is pretty good, perhaps lacking base but is very clear.  The car has many small features that can make a big difference, like grocery hooks and tie-downs in the trunk, and a pass holder in the sun visors.  I wish there was a spot to put my cell phone when it is charging.  Otherwise storage space is great.  One thing that has been bugging me is the carpet.  There is only one hook instead of two, so it keeps on moving around and sometimes ends up sliding over the clutch!  I asked the dealer about it and he said there was a recall for that in the TRD edition but not the GT so I would have to live with it.  I am ready to toss the darn thing.
This car is very attractively styled.  The styling is aggressive and young.
The lights are automatic, which is a nice feature.  Having drinks in the cup holder gets in the way of my elbow a bit when shifting.  The seats are very grippy and sporty.  The cloth material is very nice.  If you want leather, make sure you check it first because most leather seats are actually synthetic with leather trim in low-wear areas like at the sides and head rest, unless you go into a true luxury brand.  I personally think a nice cloth seat is better than synthetic leather.  Going from a four-door to a two-door, I have to be extra careful in parking lots not to dent cars around me.  Coupe doors are long!
I thought a lot about the GT-S version, which has an engine which delivers much more high-end power plus some other extras, but in the end this car gives me all the thrills I need for CAN$6000 less.  More power doesn't mean more fun, especially on roads with speed limits and cops.
I also expect this car to deliver typical Toyota quality and high-resale value.
