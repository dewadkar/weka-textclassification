            I recently purchased the Fuji MX-1200. I bought it for taking general pictures.. nothing professional. It is a great camera.. perfect for the photography enthusiast or anybody who likes having fun. When I first got the camera, I played with it for about 4 hours.  There are lots of nice features ( i like the little display pic video on the back). It's a good camera, and it's easy to use. Buy it.  Some standard features include: 1.3 million pixel CCD , resolution: 1280x960 pixels, 2x digital zoom,
1.6&quot; LCD monitor, built in flash.
