            It's been 46 years since Saab made its U.S debut at the New York Auto show. This year Saab unveiled the Limited Edition 9-3 Viggen. The 9-3 Viggen is based on the performance of the Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet. With 225 horsepower at 5,500 rpm, the Viggen is 12-percent more efficient at producing horsepower per liter of engine displacement than the new Porsche 911 Carrera, according to Saab. The 9-3 Viggen features 17&quot;X7.5&quot; light alloy wheels with P215/45R17&quot; performance tires. The Viggen's exterior styling pieces reduce aerodynamic drag by 8 percent. Only 2,500 Saab 9-3 Viggen models will be produced worldwide per year, showing up in select showrooms in May. The Saab 9-3 Viggen convertible and 5-door versions will arrive in showrooms during this fall.
