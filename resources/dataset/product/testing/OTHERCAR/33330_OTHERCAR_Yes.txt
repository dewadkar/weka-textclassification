We purchased our 1993 Grand Voyager LE in July of 1996 with 42,000 miles on it. We paid $14,000 for it, and that included a 7 year/70,000 mile bumper to bumper extended warranty. We now have 70,000 miles on the van and still love it.

We have had the van in for repairs 3 times, all warranty items, once for the transmission, once for a radiator leak, and once for heater problems. The repairs cost us $0 to repair, the warranty was wonderful. We were even given a rental to use while the repairs were being done.

The ride in the van is a smooth ride, there is plenty of room in the vehicle for our 5 kids, although now that they are getting older we wished that we had a van with the driver side sliding door. The seats are very comfortable, even on long road trips. The van handles like a car to drive, sharp turns and parking are very easy. My only complaint with the ride is the windshield seems to have a &quot;wind&quot; noise to it while on the highway, makes for a little bit of a noisy ride.

The LE van comes with am/fm cd player with equalizer, electric windows, mirrors, seats, and back vents (the windows by the back seats). We also have captains chairs. On the overhead panel there is a compass that tells you the direction you are going, how many miles per gallon you are getting, how many miles until you need to refill your tank, how many minutes/hours you have been driving on the current tank of gas, there is a cubby for your garage door opener, a cubby for sunglasses. I would go with the LE again for the options, especially the overhead panel options.

The outside body is looking a little worn, we have the wood look trim and the wood looking tape is peeling off in some areas. I would not go with the wood look trim again.
