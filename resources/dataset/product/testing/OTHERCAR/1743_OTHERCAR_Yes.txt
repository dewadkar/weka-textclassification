            This car looks nasty (the Trans-Am).  It's capable of high 13 to low 14 second 1/4 miles, so there's no need for me to tell you that it's fast or powerful.  The quad exhaust looks sweet as does the car itself, it sounds pretty throaty, and the interior layout is great.  Buying one of these cars will instantly make you cool.  No, I'm serious.  I own one and it's definitely a head turner.  It will turn the heads of any straight male and a lot of women.  Don't be shocked to see married men walking to their car (the Subaru or Honda their wives made them buy) with their wives and children while staring at your car with an intense jealousy, wishing they were still single.  You'll also turn the heads of every kid college-aged and under.  It does have more than its fair share of disadvantages, though.  Despite the electronic thigh and back lumbar support and leather seats, you will be in the emergency room after a long trip.  These seats have got to be the most god-awful uncomfortable thing ever created by man.  It's impossible to see over the hood when parking, insurance is too expensive, city gas mileage is horrendous, it's very mechanically unreliable, and fiberglass is expensive to replace.  Initially it seems cool how low the car is to the ground, but you soon forget about that after hearing that terrible scraping sound of the fiberglass ground effects screeching against the pavement every time you go out of a driveway.  There are too many blind spots, there is  leakage from the driver and passenger windows in heavy rain (I'm in Seattle, I would know), and water drains into the interior when you lift the hatch during or after it's been raining.  Also, the turning radius is terrible.  Despite all these negatives, I would still buy one of these cars again.  I love mine!
