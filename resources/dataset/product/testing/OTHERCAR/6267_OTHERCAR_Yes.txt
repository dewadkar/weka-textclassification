            I've ridden in and driven various small cars, and the Accent was the best of the bunch.  It had a sturdy feeling to it, unlike the Geo/Chevy Metro and a peppy engine. I'm tall, so the legroom was a problem, but it has equal legroom to my old Cavalier which was two feet longer than the Hyundai.  There's not much headroom, so I won't be adding a sunroof lest I want my head to permanently stick out of the roof.  My Accent is fairly basic without many options, but the factory cassette deck is made by a good company, the name eludes me.  The back seats fold down giving me quite a pit of cargo space, more than the Cavalier's back seat and trunk combined.
It has power assisted steering which by no means "power steering." the wheels don't turn unless the car is moving, which took me some getting used to after having power steering.  Only the driver's and passenger's windows roll down, so I'm curious to see how hot it'll get in the summer without AC.  The car is a little light, too, so high speeds in windy weather get you blown all over the road.
Even though my Cavalier had ABS, I think the Accent does better in snow and ice.  One thing, I am a somewhat "offensive" driver, and that part of the Accent and I don't get along.  It's too small to be mean; any SUV on the road could squash it, but that's another subject altogether.
