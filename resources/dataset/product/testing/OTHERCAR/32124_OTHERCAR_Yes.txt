            When my old Mitsubishi died, I initially thought of spending around AU$9-10,000 on a second hand Hyundai Excel or equiv. However, I decided I really just wanted the peace of mind of having a car that had only been where I'd taken it. The Hyundai Excel was clearly the obvious choice, but then I spotted the Lanos in the newspaper...off I went for a test drive.

The Lanos' main draw card is its exterior styling- for a car on the cheap end of the Australian small car market, it presents more than a cut above the rest...but most importantly, its not an Excel, and there are still relatively few on the road in Australia. Choice of colours was relatively limited, but dark metallic green was perfect for me anyway. 

Inside &amp; Space? It presents quite well, although the cost of the car is more apparent in the finishing of the interior- for example the dash is quite thin plastic, and bound to crack quickly in Australian sun. I bought the 2-door version- its surprisingly roomy and comfortable in the front- certainly one doesn't feel as if you're driving a soap box. The seats are fairly comfortable, although more supportive than soft. 

Air-conditioning &amp; Steering? Mine came with A/C, which I've found very effective on the few hot days we've had so far. Power steering was also standard, and certainly helps, although its certainly tighter than a lot of new cars I've driven. 

Other smaller details that won me over- the CD player as standard; two slide out cup-holders in front; and several small storage areas around the gear-stick.

The ride? Comfy- suspension generally very good...as smooth as I would hope for the price.

To drive? The 1.6-litre engine has plenty enough zip for the average driver, it is single-cam though, unlike the twin of the Excel. I sometimes get a little frustrated by the acceleration (don't let this put you off though- I'm referred to as a frustrated-formula-one-driver by my mother!). The gear box is a 5-speed manual, and is pretty smooth, but it has reverse to the left of 1st, accessed by pulling up a ring on the stick...its an irritation at first, but you get used to it- you do have to make sure it clicks back into neutral before you try for first though.

Fuel efficiency? For the size engine it seems pretty efficient- I get about 520km to 45L...

***Probably the best thing about buying a Daewoo in Australia though, is the 3-year warranty/Free-Care cover you get. This means that your vehicle is fully serviced and under warranty for this time, and it includes top-of-the-range RAC road-side assistance also. Great peace of mind, and it saves you a good few thousand in servicing.

I would recommend taking advantage of any specials you are offered on window-tinting at time of purchase, if you think you might want it.

I recommend this car to anyone who wants a great looking vehicle, but doesn't want to spend a fortune...singles or couples (poss. with young kids). I would certainly buy another the same.

It's a classy car for cheap...
