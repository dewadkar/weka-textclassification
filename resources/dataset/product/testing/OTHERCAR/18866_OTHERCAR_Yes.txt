            I researched my RAV for several months before purchasing.  The price,
performance, and utility all appealed to me.  Also, after a test drive, I
was truly sold.  The RAV is very perky, given its engine size plus good gas mileage.  I chose the front-wheel-drive, four-door model, as I didn't see a need for all-time four-wheel-drive.

The rear compartment is quite flexible, with fold-down seats that create a good-sized cargo area.  We have driven this vehicle for days on end, stuffed it full of luggage and people, and traveled in comparative comfort.

I know that I'm supposed to say something bad about this vehicle, but I can't find much to complain about with it.  It's quiet, comfortable, useful, cute, peppy, and I'm sure that it will be quite dependable.  My previous vehicle was a 2WD Toyota pickup truck, and I drove it for ten years, after which maybe only half of its useful lifetime was gone.  I fully expect to have my RAV for the same amount of time.  I think the only reason that I would sell it was if I were to get bored with it.

I had a friend who was shopping for a small SUV (and who was convinced that he wanted a Honda CRV) drive my RAV, and he went out and bought one two days later.<br><br>
