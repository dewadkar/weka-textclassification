              I bought this car by the pressure of my dad, a devout VW follower.  I had one American car before buying foreign.  It was a 1988 Pontiac Sunbird and I can truly say it was the worst car I ever had.  I also had an '86 Honda CRX, which I loved.  But when this car came up I jumped at the opportunity.  
  About 2 years ago (1998) I saw this bright red car along the side of the road.  Since I was looking to upgrade soon I stopped to take a look.  The body was immaculate.  And the price tag was even better.  I ran away with this car paying $2500 for something worth a lot more.  And on a college student's budget this was a lot of car for the money.  
  Overall, this is a fun car to drive.  My model is a manual shift which adds to the excitement and the vivid-red paint brings a lot of comments.  Not to mention the chance to chat with other VW owners who have cars with over 300,000 miles and they run great (By the way, this car has 150,000 miles).  Reliability is the main argument for why owners love these cars.  My car however might be an exception.  The previous owner had excellent records on repairs that were made to the car.  These showed everything including very scattered oil changes.  As a result, I had to spend $230 on new valve seals.  Other than that I only had a few minor maintenance repairs totalling about $50 over two years.  As long as good care is taken with these cars, they'll last forever.  That means: CHANGE YOUR OIL!  Other problems I have is a small amount of rust on the rear fender.  I fixed that this summer but it's still possible to tell where the blemish is.  Also, the carpeting on the roof is starting to fall down in places and I am currently trying to find a way to stop it.  
  Probably the thing I dislike most about my car is the stereo system, or lack of rather.  Two 3.5&quot; speakers up front and 2 4x6&quot; in the back don't do much justice for any type of audio other than talk radio.  To make matters worse, there is no decent airspace in the trunk to give the rear speakers any sort of oomph.  I have installed a pair of 6x9&quot; in the back, but it involved drilling.  And still they don't sound nearly as good as in my other cars.
  As for performance.  This car will get up and go when needed.  It's not the most sluggish car I've ever driven but it's not the fastest either.  If you are a speed-demon I would recommend investing in upgrade parts from Neuspeed, as they make quality parts and will fulfill your adrenaline desire.  There's no doubt the guy in the mercedes next to you will blow you away, but it keeps up with the pack.  I'm not sure about the other models, but my car is also geared fairly low.  So I reach about 3,000 RPM in 5th gear at about 55 mph which increases the acceleration a bit but also cranks up the noise while on the highway.  
  Another thing that makes this a nice car to have is its uniqueness.  In a sea of Grand Am lookalikes this car is easy to spot.  The Tornado Red and unique body structure help it stick out in a crowded parking lot.  The interior is actually roomy up front for a smaller car.  The back however isn't too spacious.  It's not bad for younger children, but when more than 2 adults occupy the back it's a tight cramp.  
  In conclusion I like this car more than the rest I've had.  I use it mainly for driving back and forth to campus and for shorter (&gt;40 miles) commutes it fairs great.  Handling is tight and it drives solid even when the roads are icy.  But for longer and quicker commutes, the lack of cruise-control and high engine rev is a little too much.  This car was mainly used as a &quot;work car&quot; for the initial owner.  Therefore he didn't take extreme car to keep it in top shape.  As long as they're taken care of well they'll devote decades of service.
