               Looking for a car that offers a wide range of unique design, power, economy, and comfort in one great affordable package?  And it's a sports car!  Well look no further.

   The Celica's interior ergonomics are superb, the six speed shifter is as good as one would require.  The steering requires just a small amount of effort, and with large powerful brakes, it makes for a great ride on a curve intensified road.  I also find all of the controls and instruments to be in perfect location, helping the driver to keep all attention on the roadway.

   Options on my car include a power sunroof, spoiler, sixteen inch aluminum wheels, ABS, side air bags, and leather seats. The color I chose is carbon blue, which at certain points looks black, but I am sure would look great in all colors. 

   While driving at highway speeds, I find the engine to be very quiet which is very pleasing, and the redline is at nearly 8,000 RPM's, very staggering.  The performance of this car is very high, and definitely a performance sports car with great handling, comfort, aggressive power output, and sleek styling.  

   I love this car and would most certainly recommend it to anyone with great confidence.  If just looking at the exterior of this car does not make your mind up, then jump in and go for a spin, I bet you won't be back any time soon.
