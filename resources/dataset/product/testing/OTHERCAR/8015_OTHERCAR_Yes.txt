            Everyone knows the phrase, &quot;Mad mom with a mini van&quot;  As of 2 years ago, this is me!  After the birth of my now 4 year old son, I knew I was going to need a more &quot;family&quot; oriented vehicle.  But..what to get??  I finally broke down and realized that the days of having a small car were gone.

While waiting out the end of the lease on my current car, my husband and I poured over the automotive classifieds for months before we found what we were looking for.  We wanted a 5 door minivan that seated our entire family, mother in law included.  There it was....in the Sunday insert of our newspaper that week, and it was beautiful!  Low mileage, showroom condition and EXACTLY what we were looking for.

I bought a 1997 Plymouth Grand Voyager LE and I will tell you that I have NEVER (knock on wood) had a problem with this vehicle since the day I brought it home.  I have since driven it across the country from Michigan to Arizona, I have hauled new appliances home in it, My husband has hauled construction materials home in it and its still in GREAT shape and purring like a kitten.  

The ONLY thing about this vehicle that is cumbersome is that when you take the rear seats out, they are HEAVY!  Its hard for me to maneuver them by myself, but other than that, I have NO complaints!

So, If you have an expanding family and you need the extra room now that you have those little ones saying, &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; or maybe you have just decided that a mini van is for you, or even that you want a larger vehicle for traveling with the family, BUY PLYMOUTH! You will NOT be sorry!  I wouldn't trade my baby for anything, in fact, I'm looking into purchasing a newer one now!<br><br>
