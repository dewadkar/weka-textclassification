            After realizing that our first child was on the way, my husband and I began our search for a minivan believing that this would be the best mode of transportation with children.  We found the Silhouette and liked several things about it.

One of the things that we liked was the automatic door.  It closes and opens so easily that it will not wake a sleeping baby.  We also like the ability to open it from the inside or outside with just a button and that the passenger can open it or the driver.  

Another reason we like it is because of the folding back seats.  One of the fist major trips we took was to the mountains with both sets of parents.  We took two cars up but were able to ride around together once we got there.  It was really easy just to remove our luggage, unfold the seats to ride and then fold them up to put the luggage back in for the trip home.

One thing I don't find very convenient is the accommodations to a car seat.  Someone had told me not to put the seat in the middle seat by the door because of the force of an impact.  We started out with the seat by the window which was fine for a while but then it got rather tiring to crawl all the way in to get the baby or seat out.  We finally moved the seat by the door and it became much easier to get the seat or baby out but I still had to kneel inside to get her.  

The van drives and rides just like a car.  In fact it is much more comfortable than some cars I have ridden in lately.

This would be the perfect vehicle for people who already have children (toddlers on up) but it's not so great for babies.  <br><br>
