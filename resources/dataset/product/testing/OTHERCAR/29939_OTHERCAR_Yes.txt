            I have had this camera for approx 1 year and love the fact that it takes still and short movies.   People are amazed - I use it all the time - the pic's are great and it is so easy - only problem - I wish batteries would last longer.Why don't we ever see this brand in the camera magazines???I suggest getting a flash path disc for quick downloads....Bought at Sears for $399.00. Try to experiment with all and any photo programs you can get - they all work with it.  Extra smart cards are inexpensive at WalMart. I show them first on the TV and record a video of the pics at the same time.  <br><br>
