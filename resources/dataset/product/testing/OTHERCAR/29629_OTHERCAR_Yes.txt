            Like many other parents, I resisted the minivan for too many years. It just didn't seem to be me, so I bought a Jeep. I loved it; the first day I had it, we got a big snowfall and I went zooming around town... Then my daughter went to a summer day camp and  my Jeep wasn't large enough to carpool. Girl Scout outings meant digging up parents to drive. 
So I did some searching and after driving almost every other van out there, I found the Quest. It was perfect! Not too big and bulky like I thought all vans were. Versatile enough to do whatever I needed it to do (carry five girls to ice skating or three with camping gear or plywood and groceries and the Christmas tree) and I'm not embarrassed to be seen in it. I've had it for 4 months and no problems yet. <br><br>
