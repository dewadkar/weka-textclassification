            My mothers 1991 Nissan Stanza XE has been in our household for almost 12 years and it's been nothing but a pleasure to drive. In this review you'll read my thoughts in different portions dealing with the stanza.

Interior
Since my mothers Stanza is the XE model she doesn't have any major extras to rant and rave about. The seats have a straight forward design and give you this feeling that you are sitting in more classier vehicle. With me being 6'3 I just barely fit comfy and upright with no problems, although the pedals seem a bit close but remember my height. The back seat isn't anything to brag about I'll just say that it does it's job as far as holding passengers that are slightly small in size in their place (hint for small families only). The gauges are simple and clear, our car doesn't have a tachometer but it's the base model. We experienced a/c problems a few years ago where the radiator word screech loudly when the air was turned on, it was fixed but quite annoying. The radio still works but the two rear speakers gave out in 96'. Now if you turn the radio up the distortion is a nuisance but tune it well and you'll be okay. Overall the interior is basic and straight forward, I like it. The chimes are in good condition while they do sound dead at times. The seat belt restraint system works as if it's new and you'll know it when you're pinned against the seat as you try to move .

Trunk Capacity/Usage
The cargo room is amazing and quite useful. While looking at the rear seat through the trunk you'd think that it folded down but it doesn't. My only problem is the tire jack it's slightly confusing to find and operate.

Driving
While behind the wheel of a Stanza I almost feel as if I'm in a sportier car. The steering gets shaky from time to time but it's very firm, fun and accurate when turning and changing lanes. The accelarator gives off a launch, and going through curves almost makes you forget what kind of car you're in. You also have a good driving position.

Durability
While my parents (I'm only sixteen)have keep this car up quite well, we've had our share of problems. The car starts up 98% of the time once was in extremly cold weather, and once it cut off on us on a hill but those are general problems some people go through. The transmission gave up on us once but was fixed. Occasionally when starting we have to push the shift lever up further to engage the start. Also when engaging drive (D) the car needs to be told twice of what gear it's suppose be in or it will roll back as if it's a stick. But those quibbles are few and far in between. With good driving and excellent maintainance your Stanza will always be in tip top condition. Our car has about 169,000 mi on it now. The Stanza sat still for almost 6 months for other reasons not related to the car and every time we started it up it revved right up just like it should each time. One thing I can say is that I never see a Stanza sitting on the side of the road.

Looks
While everyone has there own opinion I believe the Stanza hold its own with most cars in it's class today. Ours is gold and is only slightly very slightly fading but still looks great. This because it sits in the sun at an angle most of the time. 

Basically I love my Moms car and while I want a 1990-1991 Honda Prelude Si 5 speed, I'll settle for her Nissan Stanza XE any day if need be. I hope this review helps any one in need of a great and reliable car.
