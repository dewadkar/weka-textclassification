            The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-P8 is very similar to the <a href="/content_102934220420">Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-P72 Digital Camera</a> though it is slightly smaller then the small Cyber-Shot DSC-P72 Digital Camera. This is a handy pocket point and shoot digital camera with the ability to record some decent movies.

With its 3.2 megapixels the Cyber-Shot DSC-P8 is capable of printing up some nice color prints probably up to a 13 x 19 inches photo if you have a printer like the <a href="/content_65560088196">Canon S 9000 Personal Printer.</a>  Else wise any regular paper size photo printer will print you some excellent photos using glossy photo paper.

<b>The DSC-P8</b>
The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-P8 is a very small digital photo camera with the ability to take some decent home movies. It is perfect for the person wanting a point and shoot type camera that can easily fit in a shirt pocket or a purse. 

The CCD Imager is 3.3 megapixels gross and 3.2 megapixels effective.

<b>The Lens</b> 
The built-in zoom lens is a 3x zoom with range from 6mm to 18mm which is equivalent to a 35mm camera of 39mm to 117mm. 

The Aperture control is from f2.8 to f5.6 with the Shutter control being from 2 seconds to 1/2000 of a second, both Aperture and Shutter controls are automatic. 

You do have control over the Exposure Compensation with plus or minus 2 stops EV in 1/3 EV increments.

The focus ranges are from 19.7 inches to infinity and in the macro mode as close as 3.9 inches.

<b>The Flash</b> 
The built-in flash is your typical built-in flash with Auto Flash made to flash when ever the camera thinks it needs it. You also have Fill-in so it will flash each time, Red-Eye Reduction to help eliminate the red cause by a flash in the eyes and off.

The flash range is from 1.6 feet to 12.5 feet in the wide angle and 2 feet to 7.9 feet in the telephoto range

<b>Photos</b>

<b>My Results</b> 
First of all the <b><i>Battery,</i></b> the DSC-P8 uses a Sony NP-FC11 InfoLITHIUM 3.6 volt rechargeable battery and comes with the AC-LS1A AC adapter/charger. Charging time is about 2 � hours but you can use it while it is charging with the AC adapter. 

The <b><i>Battery Usage</i></b> changes depending on personal use and settings. Running the LCD all the time will drain it faster than if you turn it off. Running the camera with the LCD on all the time gave me about 80 minutes before I needed to recharge it. Running the camera with the LCD off the whole time produced about 2 � hours before it needed to be recharged.

Using the <b><i>LCD</i></b> for photo shooting shows 100% of what the photo looks like but when you use the <b><i>Optical Viewfinder</i></b> I find it to show only 80 to 85 % of what the photo will actually look like. Also the <b><i>Digital Zoom</i></b> does not work through the Optical Viewfinder but the 3x Optical Zoom Does work. 

Using the <b><i>Digital Zoom</i></b> produced a grainer photo that I was not to happy with, using the <b><i>Optical Zoom</i></b> produced great photos.  

The <b><i>Colors</i></b> of the photos look good but a little to the warm side with good <b><i>Clarity</i></b> of the photos. <b><i>Close-up Photos</i></b> turn out exceptionally well with the exception of a little Red-Eye when using the flash on a person.   

In the <b><i>Night Shot</i></b> it did remarkably well in the ISO 400 setting as long as there was some light available and as long as the shot wasn&#146t for to far a distance. 

Using the include <b><i>16MB Sony Memory Stick</i></b> in the 2048 x 1536 standard resolution filled up the memory stick with 19 photos each time I used it. 

Recording <b><i>Movies</i></b> with sound in the VX mode produced some nice 648 x 480 resolution video at 16 frames per second. The smaller resolution of 160 x 112 is too small for me but makes a smaller size for easy e-mail sending.  It doesn&#146t take long to fill up the 16MB memory stick, I got almost 5 minutes on the memory stick in the 640 x 480 setting. 

<b>Overall</b> 
The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-P8 produces nice photos under almost all light conditions and does a fairly good job on movies with sound. The good part about the movie recording is there is no time limit on recording, it will record till you stop it or the memory stick is full. You can also create animated GIF motion, a nice little feature that works rather well.

The DSC-P8 does not have a manual focus option though it offers a range of fixed focus settings from 0.5 meters to infinity.

The big plus for the camera is a rechargeable battery and AC charger, the big minus is the small 16MB Memory Stick for storage. I do recommend an extra rechargeable battery so you have a charged one all the time and at least a 128MB Memory Stick.

This is a small light easy to carry point and shoot camera that produces a good photo almost every time. There are a few manual selections that can be made like ISO settings, Scene selections and a few more. 

This is a nice and practical digital zoom camera with good results, I highly recommend the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-P8.
