            After researching online for several weeks, I decided to purchase the Canon S30. I have owned this camera for just two weeks, but have used it endlessly! I am very pleased with my purchase.

I bought the camera at Best Buy for $499. I opted for the 4 year extended warranty which cost an extra $59.99. Although I could have purchased the camera for less money online, I wanted to have local store nearby in case I encountered any problems.

The Canon S30 is a great-looking, compact, light-weight digital camera that is very easy to use. It is perfect for a beginner since the auto-mode produces great photos. For more experienced users, the manual overrides are perfect. I love being able to take black & white and sepia tone photos in the middle of a shoot. 

This camera is easy to use right out of the box. I am still learning about the extra features from the detailed owners manual. My first time using it, was driving up Mt. Washington in NH. Although the day was very cloudy, the camera produced excellent quality photos. The LCD screen works well and is large enough to view the photo with good detail. My children were thrilled to be able to see the photos right after taking them. I swear it made them more photogenic!

The only cons I have found so far is the battery life and the confusing software. Be sure to purchase a Compact card reader (only $19.99). This will allow you to download the photos to your pc without draining the batteries. I believe the battery life to be comparable to most digital cameras. The rechargeable batteries make it very easy to recharge anytime.

As far as the software, I encountered a few problems with installation. I am just beginning to get the hang of using it. I'm sure with practice, I will be happy with the software.
