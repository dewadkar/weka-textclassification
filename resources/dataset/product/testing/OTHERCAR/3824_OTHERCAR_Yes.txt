            Anyone interested in this little CRV will be surprised by
the amount of room it actually has.  My vacation trip to Florida is a true testimonial as to roominess and hauling
ability. Five adults, yes five adults went to Florida in hot
July.  Although the back seat was tight, it was bearable
mainly due to the raised seats and the extra leg room it allowed the passengers.  With the center console folder down, there was a fight for the center seat. Although at the
time I did not have tinted windows, the air conditioner was
up to parr even in 95 degree heat.

The back cargo area was packed like a bunch of sardines. We
took enough (stuff) for a month although we only stayed for
a week. (that's a wife thing, only guys can relate).  We even had a boogie board and a tent on top.  I didn't think
I needed the racks but was glad I had them.

The stereo/cd was great, the sound was crisp and clear.  The ride was smooth, the vehicles handling is very responsive.  The only time more power could have been needed
was on some of the bigger hills in Tennessee but I don't travel that road everyday with an extra 1100 pounds like
I was hauling at the time. Since the gas tank is small, refueling seems to be frequent. Average mpg is around 20.
As far as body styles, of course it a matter of choice but this vehicle works for me.

As far as AWD, I don't have it but if you travel gravel inclines, the front end is light and traction is minimal.
I feel the engine is more than enough for entering interstate highways. This CRV is very peppy.  I,ve owned this vehicle for 11 months. No problems yet.  I Love it.
