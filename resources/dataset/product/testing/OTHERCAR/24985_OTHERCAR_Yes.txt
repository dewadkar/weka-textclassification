            That is a stupid picture up there. Want to see the z34 Lumina click more information near that car, and go to year 1991, thats where the Z34 is, instead we get the boring looking lumina to have as our picture. 
The Z34 Lumina was modeled after the Nascar race cars. Mine is bright red, and has the tickets to prove that red cars get more than average. I found my Lumina and fell in Love with it the day I saw it on a lot. It was bought soon after as a present for me. My oldsmobile had had it. I thought the 3.0 v6 in a light olds was quick, I was wrong.
The Z34 comes with a 3.4 V6 multi port fuel injection, twin dual overhead cams, whats all that mean ? good gas mileage combined with POWER
210hp, in something roomy enough for 4! This car absolutely moves. So it isnt a corvette, it looks better than one. And it is pretty rare. These cars didn't sell very much during the 5 years they were produced from 1991-1995 model years. They were expensive, and fell below the camaro and corvette in buyers. Lumina, it just wasn't a name for a fast car. This was the car that replaced the Monte Carlo, which did have a history in racing and speed. People ignored the Z34 for the most part, that was their mistake. If you have one, you likely have a car that no one else has around you. Yours stands out.
The car itself looks great just sitting still, but driving is where you want to be if you have one. It actually gets around 25mpg or higher if you drive it strictly on the highway and maintain about 70mph. The car doesnt start losing mpg until you are over 85, and then it only drops to around 18. The automatic overdrive in the automatic transmission one costs you 10 horsepower, but was far more reliable than the yamaha designed 5 speed.
Travelling on the highway at 75 you are only slightly above 2000rpm. Hit the gas send that tach up over 6000 and you take off. Pass what you want, you have room to get out of the way if you need to through speed. 
The stereo is completely BOSE they say. With a Bose amp in the trunk. I disagree with the claim that it is completly BOSE, as my stereo stopped working and upon taking it out, and having it repaired, I saw the word, Blaupunkt inside it. Looks like its not entirely Bose after all.
Negatives to my beautiful car include:
REPAIR COSTS. Nothing american costs more to repair than the Z34. I really need say no more on that. Trust me.
Things don't go often, but when they do..... you better write more epinions!
Insurance, not terrible because it is listed as a Lumina, a family car. This is not really, it is a 2 door sports car, with room in back that actually fits adults, even though they will have a lot of trouble getting out. Put them in the trunk, thats huge and easier to climb out of.
