            We bought our Malibu, or should I say, leased our Malibu in March of 1999. It is a 1999 Malibu! What a great car! I've had Chevrolet cars for many years and this car is no exception to being a great car to their line.
It is quick handling, fast acceleration, streamlined well. Plenty of room for 2 adults and our 3 children, which two are teenagers. It has great acceleration when needed to get on the on-ramps! It's sharp looking, well designed and a great value!<br><br>
