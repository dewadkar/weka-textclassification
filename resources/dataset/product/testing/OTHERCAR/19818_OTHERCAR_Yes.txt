            In September, I rented a 2000 Cougar &amp; drove to Cranston, Rhode Island from Atlanta, Georgia &amp; returned. I found the Cougar to be road noisy. The noise came from the tires. I think the car needs more insulation. The seats uncomfortable. I tried every position on the electric seat. The overall handling of the car was great. It had all the factory options except the navigational system. Its steering response was great. You had a good feel of the road. The suspension was such that it hugged the road very well. The car didn't have any roll in the turns no matter how fast you went. The trunk space was very roomy. It even had a shelf to cover the more important items you wanted to hide there. The car is more suited to be a sports car than a luxury car as in the past. The price is reasonable. Overall, I would rate this car as an 4.   <br><br>
