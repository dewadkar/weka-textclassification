            What more can I say than the Toyota Sienna is not just a minivan, it's also a way of life.  My father owns this van and he travels three or four thousand miles a month in it. I have driven it and travelled for hours in it and I can't get over how nice it is.  The top ten reasons to drive this car include the following:

1.   Handling-It's true, this van does handle like a car.  In fact, 
     it has the same chassis as the Toyota Camry.  
2.   Comfort-The inside is pleasing to the eye and very comfortable
     even for me, and I'm 6'4&quot;
3.   Features-The stereo is great and the dual climate control is great 
     for people that are picky about temperature.
4.   Acceleration-Even with a full car it has outstanding pickup and 
     passing power.
5.   Looks-This is not your average minivan--it's not a box, but very 
     good looking.
6.   Dual sliding doors-If you have kids, this is a must.  Both sides of
     the car have sliding doors and they are not too bulky.
7.   Cup holders-There are cup holders everywhere in this van, it's very 
     convenient.
8.   Seats-These seats actually feel good on my back and don't leave me 
     with a stiff neck.
9.   Bumpers-The bumpers can take a beating and not crack.
10.  Fuel economy-This car gets well over 20 miles to the gallon and can
     even rival some small passenger cars.<br><br>
