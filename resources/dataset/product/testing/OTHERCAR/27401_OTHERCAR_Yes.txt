            I remember when the Neon first came out.  Lots of magazines and papers praised it as a really cool car.  The car was pretty popular from the get-go.  

Fast forward a few years.  Now the same magazines were warning to stay away from the Neon, which had gained a poor reliability reputation.  Nevertheless, despite its less than stellar record, people still buy the neon.  I see a lot of 2000 models around.

The progressive, modernistic exterior styling is what draws a lot of people, in both the old and new design(2000).  I would summarize the look as "friendly."  That "Hi" advertising campaign they used to use was really fitting.  Like the Beetle, the Neon's bubbly look is easily accused of "chick-car" styling.

So why would a guy get a Neon?  Because it has surprising performance!  The peppy 130 hp engine isn't incredibly strong, but since the Neon practically weighs nothing, it can really move and zip around.  On top of the zip, the Neon has better than average handling.

Its performance, combined with its relatively affordability, is one reason why an aftermarket of performance drivers and tuners has evolved for the Neon, like the Civic and Golf.  In fact, one popular pocket-rocket comparison in car magazines is the Sentra vs. Neon.  In short, it's a pretty fun car to drive.

The car itself is pretty comfortable inside and often praised for having a good amount of room for a compact car.  I've taken 1400-mile roadtrips with a full load before(5 people).  It was crowded in the back, but we survived.

So the biggest drawback is probably the quality and reliability.  The Neon is constantly criticized for being "crude" and "unrefined."  This is most noticeable with the cabin noise at high speeds.  At around 65+ mph, it starts sounding like a space shuttle, and you sorta have to turn your head and shout to talk to passengers.  Also noticeable is the crude auto transmission.  The car tends to hiccup and jerk around like it's having a heart attack as it shifts gears.

I had one significant engine problem that cost several hundred to repair.  Other then that, there are a bunch of small, irksome things.  The brakes tend to squeal a lot.  The car sort of shakes and rattles a lot at times.  The turn signal sticks sometimes, the hazard lights don't work quite right, and recently the back speakers quit on me.  

In short, for me it's been a fun ride, a good college car, and a great first car, but if you are buying a used one (95-99), definitely get a look at its maintenance records.

Added July, 2001:

Now that I no longer have the Neon, here's a few things I MISS about it, even though I love my new car:

-The Neon had GREAT air conditioning.

-The Neon had these really bizarre looking sun-visor extenders that slid out.  People always sort of laughed at them when they saw it, but heck, those things were USEFUL.  Good thinking and good engineering by Chrysler.
