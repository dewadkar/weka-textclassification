            As a first-time digital camera owner, I found it a breeze to use right out of the box.  The manual was very clear and easy to understand for the more complex features. 

Having never owned a digital camera before, I was alarmed at the rate of battery usage.  I'm really glad it came with Ni-MH rechargeables as I used up the alkaline batteries it also came with the first night, just playing around.  I would recommend a second set of Ni-MH rechargeables if you are going to be using it daily.  For general home use, one set is fine. They also last a lot longer than the alkalines.
There is also quite a lag time between when you press the shutter button and when the picture is actually taken.  It makes it hard to get some of those shots of your little ones in action, which is one reason I got it.

I am impressed with the flash.  You get a nice, even light throughout the whole picture.  My 35mm will just light up the middle of the picture, sometimes washing out the subject, and leave the edges looking like nighttime even if it's not.

On-screen resolution is great, even in the low settings.  I was not as impressed when I actually went to print the pictures out on photo paper.  The pictures I didn't have to crop and enlarge came out good on 4x6 pictures.  But otherwise the resolution was rather poor.  I take all my pictures on the "high" resolution and "best" quality. However, as I am still learning, it could be just me.

This is still a great camera for what I paid for it. Mine was factory-refurbished with a one-year warranty, 2 sets of batteries, charger and 16MB card.  I wouldn't pay the $500-600 brand-new price, but they are all over E-bay for what I paid for it.
