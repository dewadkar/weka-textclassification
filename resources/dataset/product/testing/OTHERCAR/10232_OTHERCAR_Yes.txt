            Ok. This is THE best SUV in the market. If you like the noise a Porsche or the quietness of a Mercedes, this car has it all. I purchased this car last year and it is going strong. The best feature in this model is the four speed tiptronic function. This allows one to have a manual car without the tediousness of a clutch and timing. The conveniently placed gear shifters are on the back of the steering wheel for shift up and the front for shift down. There is also an overdrive function to give you that VROOM noise that so many car owners dream about. The handling is great and the fuel economy is brilliant. I get about ten kilometers per litre according to my on board computer, another funky feature. The interior is great. Spacious, leather, comfortable. The body frame is nearly as big as a minivan but the seating capacity is five so there is a LOT of room inside. The trunk is large and roomy as well. There are 12v electrical ports in the front, back, and trunk. Up until the speedometer reaches 40 km/hr, the engine makes a jet plane like acceleration noise. After that, it gets dead quiet. All in all, this is THE best SUV out there for anyone not trying to do some serious offroading.<br><br>
