            &quot;Rotate your tires every 3,000 miles&quot;.  That was the recall I received for my 1997 Pathfinder to correct the front end suspension problem which led to the &quot;cupping&quot; and extreme tire wear.  Though an ongoing problem that can be found in the usenet newsgroups, Nissan prefers to resolve it with a difficult tire rotation.  Not such an easy task for a vehicle that was leased for my wife. 
I have a Nissan Sentra, now at 138,000 trouble free miles, and looked forward to leasing a new Pathfinder.  The subsidized lease from Nissan was untouchable from any competing SUV dealer.  The low step in height, unibody construction and car like ride was ideal for my wife and kids.  Also taking the Pathfinder on the beach was great as the ride is controlled and free of all the squeaks and rattles so typical of domestic vehicles.  This is a vehicle that drives like a sedan, that is until the tires start wearing.
It starts with a little shaking of the steering wheel.  &quot; No problem&quot; I think to myself, &quot;Needs an alignment&quot;.  36,000 miles, 5 alignments and a new set of tires later, I still have shaking in the steering wheel, an annoying howl from the wearing front tires and a backache from rotating the tires every 3000 miles. Dealer support has been unhelpful as they keep saying the truck is out of alignment.  They did replace the front tires at their expense when they did the recall on the load sensing valve and extended the exhaust warranty to 60,000 miles after they drilled holes in the exhaust, I think to drain condensation buildup, at Nissans recommendation. 
Remember, this is a 4X4 that is supposed to handle the trails of the outback.  Parking at the local grocery store or a short drive on soft beach sand shouldn't put the truck out of alignment.
From what I understand, the front end suspension problem is limited to the 96 and 97 models.  
My lease goes up this March.  Will I lease another?  
With the new powerful 240-hp, 3.5-liter engine, it is tempting.  I do like the new front end on the 99.5 and up trucks.  And my Sentra keeps going forever (When it goes &quot;I&quot; get a new work car.)   The family has grown to 3 kids and the back seat is a little tight for 3 car seats.
With 3 kids, I think this may be my excuse, that and I can't afford a new set of tires every 15,000 miles anymore.<br><br>
