            I traded my 1993 Toyota Corolla DX Wagon for a 1990 Vanagon Carat Weekender two years ago when both cars were pushing the 135,000 mile mark.  &quot;Geordi&quot; (as in La Forge) is now pushing 165,000 miles and going strong if I overlook the inevitable squeaks and creaks he puts out.  The body was in great shape when I got it; the interior a little grubby, but he cleaned up ok.

I love this car, despite the fact that I spend probably $2,000 a year fixing this, that or the other thing to keep it going.  Brakes here, transmission there, weird cooling system fixes, new shocks, and so on...maybe I'm just the lucky owner of a previously abused vehicle.  Day to day maintenance includes keeping an eye on the coolant and oil and that's about it.

I love Geordi because of the feel of its drive, and the fact that it makes a normal commute feel like a road trip. I've never had a car before that felt so much a part of me.  There is no other car I would want to drive.

Also on the plus side, Vanagons always seem able to be brought back to life and back into good working order, engine-wise and body wise.  When Geordi is really ready for the scrap heap, I will feel as if I'd lost a friend.
