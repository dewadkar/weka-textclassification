            I bought the '87 Golf at an auction.  I am also a Lincoln Town Car driver.  I love the fuel economy of this car.  I love being able to get into teeny-tiny parking spaces.  I like the sturdiness of the seats.  I like the rear windshield wiper.  The car is a lot of fun to drive on a sunny day, I only wish I had a sun-roof.  

The worst thing about my Golf is the rack and pinion steering.  This is awful compared to my Lincoln Town car's power steering.  It is next to impossible to get spare parts at an import wrecking yard.  Outside of VW Foxs, there are no, no VW's to be had on the secondary market for the 80's years.  There are also none in the newspaper, so I guess this is a good thing?  I will have to see Maaco paint shop very soon because the paint is peeling.  There is no armrest in the GL model, this is one feature that I really miss when not driving my Lincoln.  Perhaps I can have one installed?  There are no automatic locks in the GL model.  The dash light is very dim, and I am told that the steering column will have to be removed to replace the light.  How troublesome.  I did have to put over $700.00 of repairs into this $775.00 auction car.  I had to have the battery and alternator replaced.  I had to have (3) plastic seals replaced.  I had to buy a bracket and shaft for the shifter.  I had to have the guide for the shifter adjusted.  Soon I will need to have the radiator replaced. 
The seat belts trap me in so tightly that I think that I am on a roller coaster ride.  I really do not like being strapped in that tightly.  My Lincoln Town car has really made me lazy.

I plan to keep this car because i think that it is, or will soon be a collector's car.   

The best thing about all of this work is that I found an excellent mechanic, Phill and Kelly.  They work in Grand Prarie, TX at Pyatts auto repair shop.  I love them.  Phil fixed this car up perfectly.

I am still loving my 1987 VW Golf and it is 2 Oct 2002.  I just had front and rear Monroe strut put on it, and it drives beautifully.  I did have to replace a plastic box that is a resevoir for the fuel.  It is a second fuel pump recepticle.  The box costs $97.00 and this does not include the labor cost which was $90.00.
