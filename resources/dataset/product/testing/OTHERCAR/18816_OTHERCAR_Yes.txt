            I am leasing a 1998 Cherokee and am absolutely loving it!! My husband and I decided to lease a Jeep Cherokee because we wanted an 4X4 SUV that we wouldn't have to pay an arm and a leg for, one that we knew we could rely on, and one that we knew would be fun. I have always loved jeeps and have always wanted one. We have only had it for a year, and haven't had any problems with it at all. The body style is great, the acceleration is great, the interior style is great! Another thing we really love about our jeep is that it drives like a car! It is easy to park (even in tight spaces), easy to turn, easy to handle, and rides smoothly. It is also quiet! We have had people comment on how surprisingly quiet our jeep is! If you are looking for a luxury vehicle though, the Jeep Cherokee is not for you. It is not a luxury vehicle. The Jeep Cherokee does not offer a lot of leg room, especially in the back seat. It is not easy to get in and out of the back seat! You could fit 4 adults in the Jeep Cherokee comfortably, but add one more adult and you are cramped (unless you put them in the very back cargo area!!) There is plenty of room in the passenger and driver seats though! Another thing I don't like about the back seat is that there is no place to rest your head, and the seatbelts come across your neck instead of your chest. If you are looking for a fun, reliable vehicle, and an engine design that has been used since WWII.....the Jeep Cherokee is for you!!<br><br>
