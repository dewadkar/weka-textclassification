            I needed to buy a car with little down-payment, enough space to fit my growing family and from a dealer that could provide a god service. I had three options: Saturn, Ford Escort and Hyundai Elantra (all wagons), these were the ones in my price range. The Hyundai, although not as popular as the others, got my attention because of the service/quality commitment of the manufacturer. I read some reviews and it got some nice ones, although they always pointed out problems with the transmission (reluctant downshift) and some other minor details. Well, I bought it. So far I can not complain, I have enough space, fuel economy is acceptable, the reluctant downshift is true, but it does not bother me. It is nice to drive and looks nice too. The service at the dealer has been excellent and haven't had any major problems. One thing that I find annoying is that it does not warn you when leave the lights on and take the keys out of the ignition, although when the key is not in the ignition the main lights are turned off, which helps a little. In overall I am a happy customer. I'll keep it for the long run!!!<br><br>
