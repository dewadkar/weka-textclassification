            I recently bought this 2000 toyota tacoma. It is dark green, standard, 2.7L 4cyl engine. My last truck was a 1993 toyota pickup with a 2.2L 4cyl.  This truck only has a slightly larger engine but it makes the difference. I would highly suggest getting at least a 2.7L even if you are just driving in the city.  Anything smaller and you have serious problems getting up large hills. The fuel economy is outstanding. I get about 24 miles a gallon and that isn't bad at all for a pickup truck. I don't have any 'extras' in my truck other than power steering, air conditioning and custom detail work. It's a very nice truck. It looks good and isn't in the shop getting fixed all the time. I could go on and on about all the safety features this truck has. But I'll just say if I am in an accident I hope I'm in a toyota. I was in an accident with my '93 pickup and that truck held up very well.
