            We've had our 1999 New Beetle since July of 1999 and we love it!  Not only does it look great (with that unmistakable and classic Beetle shape) but it offers power, safety and economy in the most recognizable and cheerful package on the road today.

The interior is surprisingly roomy for a two-door coupe, with a high roofline, plenty of glass, and enough legroom for my 6'2&quot; frame in front and my 7 year old son behind me.  And it's safe.  The New Beetle was ranked number one in the government's most recent crash tests, beating out all other vehicles in its class.  Even the base model boasts dual front and side airbags, four wheel disc brakes with antilock control, and 16-in wheels.

We have just had our first snow storm of the year, and our first with the New Beetle.  It was fantastic in the white stuff.  The car feels planted and secure in the snow.  

And we cannot forget to mention the sheer fun we have driving it around!  People beep and wave to us as we drive by.  Normally reticent drive-thru attendants will shout, &quot;Nice Car!&quot; as we pull up to the window.  It's nice to have fun behind the wheel again.  The last time we felt this way? -- in our 1975 SuperBeetle Convertible!<br><br>
