            <b>UPDATE 12/2001</b> - <i>Had to send camera in due to it not working even when new batteries are installed. They sent an "upgrade" of PDC 640 Plus. Received it and having same problem as other one. Couldn't even take ONE photo with it. Do NOT recommend this camera!!</i>

Let me tell you about my new toys and how much I love them!!  =)
This opinion includes information about the following products: 

***My Polaroid PDC-640 Digital Camera and information about the items that were included in the retail box.

***SanDisk FlashPath Floppy Disk Adapter (purchased separately.)

***(4) 1600 MaH NIMH batteries and overnight charger (an extra I happened to luck out on getting with my purchase of the camera).

***8 MB SmartMedia card (also an extra I lucked out on).

I will start with just the information on the Polaroid PDC-640 digital camera and what it usually comes with.  I could not find a place to put the other extras, but thought anyone who was interested in purchasing one (or already owned one) might be interested in the other products I received that can improve the usage of this camera.  That way, anyone who wants to ONLY know information on the camera itself can skip the bottom information.  =)

As mentioned in an earlier opinion I wrote, I won as an "at home" player on GameShow Network's "Inquizition".  My prize was a check for FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.  As I waited for it to arrive, I pondered all of the ways I could spend it.  That is a LOT of money, especially for a Stay-At-Home Mommie like myself.

I believe I spent it wisely (yes, of course it was gone within a few days of receiving it!!), mostly on Christmas for the kids, and some clothing for my "Moose Baby" who just turned three and a half, but is already in size 8 clothing.  (You read that right, it is NOT a typo.)

Everyone knows that I NEVER buy anything for MYSELF, so the first thing that my bestest best friends helped me to decide was to SPEND some of it on me.  The only reason I agreed was that I planned on buying a digital camera and using it to generate more money coming into the house via Ebay auctions.  So, that decided, I spent my time between winning and getting the check by comparison shopping to see what the prices were.

I started my search by cheating in a way... one of my best friends (Chelle - My3LilMen here on Epinions) had been telling me all about her new camera and how pleased she was with it.  For me, who is technologically very low on the totem pole, I knew I would have an easier time learning about my new camera if I had someone who had owned the same kind longer and could teach me whatever I needed to know.  That was a plus for the Polaroid PDC-640from the start.

Next, I checked (where else??) Epinions to read what others had to say about THEIR PDC-640.  Amazingly enough, all information I could find pointed to this being a terrific camera for the price.  Ok, so being pretty much talked into it, I went to several online stores to compare prices, and also checked at the local WalMart.  

Once I got the check, it was off to search auctions on Ebay.  After watching several, I got a pretty good idea of what the basic price range was via auction there.  THEN...

MY auction happened.  The one I KNEW I needed to bid on.  Granted the price was higher, but I believed it was worth it.  I got several extras and here is what I ended up with:  (I am going to give the specs on the camera, for those who are interested as I believe this information is important to those looking into the possibility of purchasing one.)

The PDC-640's features include the following:

A 1.8 inch LCD monitor/viewfinder which allows you to view, replay or delete images.  I enjoy the fact that you can use it to see exactly what your camera will capture without guesswork as to whether you are accurately centered, etc. or not.  You also get the wonderful option of seeing the exact photo for your choice in saving or deleting it.

The Flash gives you four separate modes.  Auto, fill-in, red-eye reduction and off. Within minutes you will find that you are able to learn quickly which one to use for which shots.  The easier the better as far as I'm concerned!!

Autofocus. Need I say more??

<b>Removable memory card (2MB SmartMedia card) which will store 36 images in standard resolution at 640X480 and 96 images at 320X240.</b> Granted, I can't give too much information on this particular card, as mine came with an 8MB card through the deal I got.

<b>Point-and-Shoot means only a couple of seconds of waiting time between shots in non-flash mode, and just under 10 seconds to recharge in flash mode.</b>  I personally have never had a problem at all in the time between shots.  I have definitely been pleased with the speed of this little camera.

<b>Bright optical viewfinder.</b> No kidding!!  My kids were talking about how they were on the "little color TV" on the back of my camera.

<b>Additional information about the PDC 640 Digital Camera:</b>

This camera won the PC Photo Review Consumers Choice Award!!

(of cameras reviewed in PC Photo Review between August 1, 1999 - August 1, 2000.)

<b>Comparison Prices as of 11/14/2000:</b>
www.PhotoAlley.com  $199.95
www.d-store.com  $199.95
my local WalMart in North Carolina $149.94

or, on Ebay the guy that I got my camera w/extras from currently has 6 auctioning now.  (I don't actually know him, but would recommend him highly from my purchase - email me if interested.)

Also, there are usually several auctions running on Ebay for this camera, usually at lower prices even than WalMart.

<b>Extras I got with my purchase on Ebay that I really enjoy:</b>

*(4) 1600 MaH NIMH batteries and overnight charger* (all 4 of these will charge 500+ times to save me approx. $2000. for the cost of disposables.  NIMH are memory free and last twice as long as NICAD in the camera.  The 1600 MaH are the newest and most powerful generation of NIMH batteries.  (Many are only 1200 MaH or 1400 MaH.)

*8 MB SmartMedia card which gives you approx. 6 times the photos as the 2 MB card that comes with the camera.

Within a few minutes of receiving my camera, I was able to have it set up and start taking pictures.  UNTIL... I decided to download and see how they looked online.  Ugh.  Ended up I did not have an additional port!!  (What to do, what to do??)  What good is a new toy if you can't properly play with it??

Back to Ebay. For about $60. I ended up getting a <b>SanDisk FlashPath Floppy Disk Adapter</b>.  What is that you may ask?? Well, it means for me that I can actually get my pictures online and FASTER than uploading from my camera.  

<b>Information on the FlashPath Adapter:</b>
(This is typed directly from the back of the box, just to give you an idea of what it does.)

<b>Fast and Simple</b>
FlashPath is a convenient floppy disk-shaped adapter that lets you read and write data to SmartMedia using your computer's floppy disk drive.  It's perfect for:
*Digital Cameras
*File Transfers
*General data storage

<b>Easy data transfer to your PC:</b>
Just insert a SmartMedia card into FlashPath, then insert FlashPath into your floppy disk drive to transfer files to your computer.  Acess FlashPath like a standard floppy disk.  No cables or connectors required.

<b>Portable storage for your files:</b>
FlashPath and SmartMedia are perfect for portable, easy-to-use storage for word processing files, electronic slide shows, graphic images, audio files, spreadsheets, or any other digital data.  FlashPath and SmartMedia are light and easy to carry and work interchangeably with PCs and laptops.

<b>Technical specifications:</b>
*Works with standard 1.44MB, 3.5-inch floppy disk drives
*Requires 80486 (or later) or Pentium processor (PCs); or PowerPC 601 (Macintosh; read-only capabilities).
*Uses two standard CR2016 lithium batteries.
*Works with 2MB, 4MB (3.3 volt and 5 volt), 8MB, 16MB and 32MB SmartMedia cards.  FlashPath will support higher capacity SmartMedia cards when they are available.

<b>In the package:</b>
*FlashPath 3.5-inch adapter and two CR2016 batteries (installed)
*Quick and easy installation program
*User Guide

<b>Caution:</b>
FlashPath cannot be used with a floppy disk drive connected via a PC card. The Macintosh version of FlashPath is a read-only application and does not have write capabilities.

I have really enjoyed my adapter.  It's easy to use, and downloads very quickly.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an alternative method for downloading pictures with the <b>Polaroid PDC-640</b> camera.

Also a plus is that if you have the adapter inserted, but haven't used it for a few minutes, it automatically turns itself off to save on the batteries.

I think my favorite thing about my new toys are that I can finally share pictures online with my family and friends.  I have a decent printer, so personally I do not need a mega-pixel camera at this time.  

On my Epinions public profile is a picture taken by this camera.  It's the large one of my two kids.  This will give you an idea of the quality that you can get out of this inexpensive camera.  I also used the PhotoMAX software to crop the photo of the kids. 

Feel free to email me for other photos to help you make a better purchasing decision.  

If I had to list my favorite thing about the camera itself, it would be hard to choose, but the thing that really comes to mind is the money saved on developing BAD pictures.  LOL  Instead of wasting film and developing on pictures that shouldn't even be printed, you can just press the magic DELETE button and try again.  

(Be honest... you KNOW almost everyone gets a photo of a child that turns their head at the last minute, or someone in the group ALWAYS blinks, or perhaps you forget to take the lens cover off.)

Not to mention the fact that you can instantly see the photo taken and decide if it's a "keeper" or not.  Before anyone moves, take another that you will be happy with!!

Ok.  I'm sure I could find more to say, but to be honest, it's 4:30am and I have been working on this for 3-4 hours now.  My knee is KILLING me and my rear has morphed into this chair. LOL I hope all of the information is helpful to anyone who is looking to purchase the <b>Polaroid PDC 640 Digital Camera</b>.  

I love mine and wouldn't trade it for ANYTHING!!!  It's my first digital camera and it's so simple.  I'd recommend it to anyone!!  =)

<b>UPDATE 12/2001</b> - <i>Had to send camera in due to it not working even when new batteries are installed. They sent an "upgrade" of PDC 640 Plus. Received it and having same problem as other one. Couldn't even take ONE photo with it. Do NOT recommend this camera!!</i>
