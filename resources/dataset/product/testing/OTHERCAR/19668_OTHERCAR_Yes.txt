            I am the proud owner of a 1999 Saturn SL2.  I purchased this car during my first year in law school.  My Honda Civic had just taken its last breath and I was hard pressed to find another car.  I rolled my car down to the local Saturn dealership and the love affair began.  The employees at Saturn treated me like an ally, not an adversary like other salesmen had.  Their goal was to let me experience Saturn cars, find one that fit my budget and taste, and make the deal.  This was a far cry from the treatment I had been given at Honda and Toyota, where I felt like I was going to a haggling war with people not interested in my interests, but interested, rather, in squeezing the largest commission they could out of me.

Saturn really is a different kind of car company.  No haggling and low cost make the Saturn experience an good one.  The SL2 is a roomy mid-sized car with a beautiful glossy finish that isn't subject to dings like other cars are.  The engine in the 5-speed manual transmission is not very large, but it gets the job done effortlessly.  This is a smooth and stylish ride.  This is a great car for both young and old, men and women.  Go down and drive one.  Become a member of the Saturn family.

I love my Saturn!<br><br>
