            The M-class delivers a nice, solid punch with its incredible stock V8, and handling and on-road performance is reminiscent of quite a few sports cars.  Quiet ride, and interior abounds with amenities...standard leather seats and a sweet stock sound system.  The 4WD system is quite capable.  It doesn't rival the Grand Cherokee's Quadra-Drive, but it still allows the M-class to rank as one of the better off-roaders of the day.  While just about everything about this sport-ute is impeccable, you would expect more practicality for the buck.  The cargo space is limited, and seating is maxed at 5, which even a Rodeo can handle.  However, you can't expect a Suburban equivalent from Mercedes, and besides, the performance more than makes up for the lack of practicality.<br><br>
