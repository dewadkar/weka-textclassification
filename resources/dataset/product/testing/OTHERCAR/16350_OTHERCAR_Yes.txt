            I am a very impatient person, that is why I love this product.  I have always hated to send film to be developed, and it is too expensive to use 1 hour photo.  I was looking for a nice compromise.  I found it in this camera.  

All I have to do is take the camera home and download the pictures into my computer and print.  The picture quality is very good; although not as good as 35mm, but well worth it.  You have the option to edit the picture before you print including zoom, reduced red-eye and picture clarity.  

You never have to buy film again.  In my opinion that alone makes it worth the price.  I have seen other digital cameras that cost much more but require a disk to be able to take pictures.  They only hold a few pictures before the disk has to be replaced. That can be a real hassle if you run out of disk space in the middle of an event.  

It is not expensive compared with other cameras similar to this one.  It is worth the price and will even save you money in the long run.<br><br>
