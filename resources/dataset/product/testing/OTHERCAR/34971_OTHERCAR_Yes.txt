            I have just received my new 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix.  The car has a very comfortable feel and ride.  I have the smallest of the 6 cylinder offered.  Although the engine is the smallest, the pickup is sufficient for city interstate driving(I use this car for business and travel around Chicago quite a bit).  The dash and accessories are conveniently located.  Plenty of little storage areas as well as the compartment between the seats.  Trunk space is adequate( I often have to carry samples or make small deliveries to customers).

The only downside I have experienced over the last two months is I do not like the automatic door lock feature when you put the car in gear.  Also on several occasions, I have left the car and kept it running to &quot;sign in&quot; at a guard shack only to somehow have the doors automatically lock on me.  This has not been a problem since I carry the spare valet key in my wallet, however, be careful of this feature which is also probably on many other newer cars.<br><br>
