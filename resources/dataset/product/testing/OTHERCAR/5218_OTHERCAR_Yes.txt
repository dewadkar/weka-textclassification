            I've owned this camera since July '99 and love it. This is my first introduction to a digital and I can't believe how easy it is to use!  The software included for your pc is easy to install and use.  The instructions for use of the camera are just as easy that as soon as I bought it, I was able to take it home and take pictures right away.  It's small and lightweight which makes it great for traveling and taking lots of pictures without getting tired arms.  I love the different settings it has for red-eye, the quality of pictures, the self-timer, and the continuos shooting capabilities for those special moments like baby's first steps. All the connections are easy to use for both computer viewing and tv viewing of your photos. The only problems I'm finding right now are that you do need a high quality printer to print the pictures with good quality, and if the picture is taken at a distance, the images do tend to be fuzzy. I paid a little higher than some, but I also got a package with mine that included a power adapter and additional 8mb disk.<br><br>
