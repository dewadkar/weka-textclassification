            Purchased new in '91, this vehicle has performed optimally for all tasks. Hauling furniture up gravel-paved mountain roads several times over the last 8 years has always been a snap in this truck. A dependable, sturdy, well-handling vehicle for long-hauls with full bed load halfway across the country was both inexpensive and easy to manage. 

This model is a five-speed, four-cylinder standard body truck that has never left me stranded. Current maintenance 8 years later is no problem - just regular oil changes and tire checks.  

Minor wear and tear problems included cracked (and leaking) hydraulic line on clutch and rotor replacements.

I believe this truck will give me several more years of reliable, trouble-free service.<br><br>
