            This is actually my second review of the Mazda Prot�g�.  My first review was after a VERY lengthy test drive, and was of an LX model with a manual transmission.  The LX manual is probably my idea of the perfect economy car, fast, fun to drive, comfortable, and priced right.  I didn&#146t buy that car, choosing instead of repair my very trouble-prone 2002 Mitsubishi Galant yet again.

Well, my Galant woes began anew, and so, once again I went car shopping.  This time, however, I went shopping with a different set of priorities.  Yes, driving fun remains very high on my list, but the way I use a car dictated that I spend as little as possible, and get as reliable a vehicle as I can.

The way I use a car translates into roughly 2,500 miles per month, with 1,000 of that a monthly round-trip from Los Angeles to San Jose for my Army Reserve training.  2,500 miles per month will destroy the resale value of any car, and deplete most warranties very quickly.  A car that isn&#146t screwed together well will really show it, as my Mitsubishi Galant did.

Putting that many miles on a car also means that ease and comfort are more important than features and goodies.  I love driving a manual transmission, but not at the end of a six-hour drive when I hit Los Angeles traffic.  I like power locks and windows, but not when they fail just after the warranty expires.

So, with all that in mind, I am the proud new owner of a 2003 Mazda Prot�g� DX with automatic transmission, air conditioning, 6-disc CD Changer, and nothing else.  This is basic transportation folks, with manual locks, remote manual mirrors, no cruise control, manual crank windows, and an absolute, total lack of luxury features.  Guess what?  I like it.

Sitting down in the drivers seat, you are presented with a very clear and logical instrument panel.  There is no tachometer, but with an automatic transmission, I can live without it.  It does have a large, clear speedometer, fuel and temperature gages, and the usual idiot lights.  The steering wheel is a nice 3-spoke that is well shaped and has a tilt-adjustment.  The seats are not height-adjustable, but honestly, I don&#146t miss it as the driving position is as perfect as in any car I&#146ve ever driven.  Everything falls readily to hand and has an extremely high quality feel.  Even Toyota could learn a thing or two about control feel from the turn signal and headlight switches in this inexpensive Mazda.

Starting the car things get even better.  The engine idles smoothly and even with the automatic transmission, pulls the car from a standstill with real authority.  There is engine and exhaust noise, but it is the kind of noise that car enthusiasts like, producing a willing snarl that at least to me, is not at all intrusive.  The engine has plenty of low-end torque, is well matched to the transmission which shifts smoothly and at just the right time, though it does get loud enough to bother passengers at high rpm (can&#146t say how high without a tach).  Strangely, though this is the same engine as in the 5-speed LX I tested a few months ago, it feels smoother with the automatic.  I called this engine buzzy in the 5-speed, and while it can get a little harsh at high-rpm in the auto, it is much more subdued with the automatic.

The seats are very firm, feeling very European.  The European character continues elsewhere in the interior, with proper grab handles for all outboard passengers and a nice upright seating position, even in the rear.  Speaking of the rear, the seat is firm and well padded, with a high-enough and firm-enough cushion to offer real thigh support even to adults.  While there are three seatbelts back there, this really is a four passenger car, at least for longer trips.

Road manners are where this car excels.  Yes, the car is very firmly suspended, which means that you will feel bumps and pavement imperfections around town.  The Prot�g� rides like a sports sedan because, guess what, it IS a sports sedan.  The tires are proper V-rated 55-series Potenzas that grip the road as if on rails.  The suspension is firm enough that there is practically no body roll, and the steering tracks far better than anything twice its price has any right to.  This car really is fun to drive, even in the base trim level with an automatic. 

Cruising is a different story.  There is a bit of wind noise, but no more than other cars in this class.  Once again, the sporty suspension makes itself known, but in a good way.  Like a BMW 3-series, this is not a soft and plush car, but it is a comfortable one at speed.  You can feel the road surface, but it isn&#146t annoying.  The car communicates what it is doing, and when gliding down an interstate at 75 or 80MPH, it tracks straight and delivers a smooth, compliant, though firm ride.  Its no Cadillac, but then, it was never meant to be.

One area where the Prot�g� is no longer competitive with its class is fuel economy.  I&#146ll report back when I&#146ve put a few more tanks through it, especially an all-highway tank, but in mixed driving thus far I&#146m getting about 28MPG.  The car is listed at 25 city and 30 highway, so I&#146m right on the mark, and 8MPG better than the Galant it replaced.

Going from a fully-loaded mid-size car to a bare bones compact means that on my long drive I won&#146t have the pleasure of cruise control.  This, and the keyless entry are two features that I really will miss.  There is something to say for a car lacking in power toys though.  Despite the automatic transmission, the car has a very honest quality to it.  It feels strong, sturdy, and dependable.  Where the Galant at 2-years-old and 38,700 miles felt used up, this car is so much tighter than that one was when new, that I am sure this car will age much better.  This is backed up by other opinions, car magazine reviews and reliability reports for over a decade.

A car&#146s comfort, road manners and performance are not all that matters.  Appearance is important, both inside and out, as is safety, and of course, value.  Appearance is another Prot�g� strong-suit.  Despite the age of this design, which is to be replaced by the all-new Mazda 3 for 2004, the Prot�g� is a very handsome car.  It has a wide track and sits squat on its wide tires, giving it a serious, sports sedan look.  The headlights and taillights are attractive, as are the turn signal repeaters on the front fenders &#150 a very European touch.  Even the plastic wheel covers don&#146t look too bad.  The Prot�g� is tall, boxy, and angular, looking much like the previous generation C-class Mercedes.  I especially like the high trunk and the creases along the sides of the hood.

The interior is even nicer than the exterior, with nicely contrasting tan and brown two-tone dash and doors, and plush tan seats and carpet.  It is very tasteful and not at all overdone.  The entire interior is plastic, but it is a high grade of plastic.  Everything is soft to the touch and looks and feels well made.  Panel gaps, inside and out, are very tight.  Even the simple instruments are attractively styled with bezels around each gage and stylish lettering that is backlit in green at night.

Safety is pretty standard.  I didn&#146t pay extra for anti-lock brakes or side airbags, so I don&#146t have the benefits of that equipment.  The brakes are powerful and the seatbelts are of modern design with pre-tensioners and force limiters.  What I consider the most important safety feature of any car isn&#146t passive safety, or what it does in the even of an accident, but rather active safety.  Here the Prot�g� does very well.  The sporty suspension, sticky tires and good acceleration make it easier to avoid an accident in the Prot�g� than in plusher cars with less capable hardware.

Finally, value.  The Prot�g� at sticker price, or even invoice, is not a great value compared to its more modern and fuel efficient competition.  However, when the end-of-model rebates are added, currently $2,500, the situation changes radically.  My Prot�g� DX, with Air Conditioning, Automatic and the 6-disc CD Changer (couldn&#146t find one without either the CD changer or a spoiler) was $14,700 before rebates, which will buy a Corolla, which is a better, though not as sporty car.  However with the rebate, the Prot�g� only cost me $11,200 ($2500 customer cash, $500 graduate student, $500 dealer cash), which is the same price as an automatic, four-door Hyundai Accent or Toyota Echo.  Against these cars, which belong a full class below the Prot�g� in the marketplace, there simply is no comparison.

Before I bought that 2002 Galant, I had a 1997vNissan Sentra GXE with a 5-speed.  I got so tired of that car after four years that I traded it on a much plusher, but lower quality car.  After barely six months with the Galant, I wished I could wind back the clock and take back my Sentra.  I am confident that that little Nissan would still be going strong today.  It was a solid little car that handled well for what it was, was fun to drive, and actually a comfortable cruiser.  My new Prot�g� reminds me of that Nissan.  Sure, the character is totally different as that Nissan was fully loaded and a stick while my Prot�g� is stripped with an automatic.  The Nissan was also slower and didn&#146t handle nearly as well, but made better noises from the engine compartment and had a smoother, quieter ride.  No, it is something else that makes one remind me of the other.  It is a certain tightness in how the dashboard is securely attached to the car, the firmness of the seats and the obvious attention to detail in the final assembly.  

Actually, this Mazda is even better in that regard than the Nissan was.  When this one starts getting on in years, I just hope that it remains as reliable as that Nissan did, so that I can learn from my mistake and ignore new-car-envy.  Given the fun to drive nature and comfortable, if simple accommodations in this base Prot�g�, I expect to enjoy waiting to find out.

***Update 12/12/03***
Okay, I've had the car for 3 weeks and 1,500 miles, and thought I should add a few comments about it as a daily driver.

First, my car was delivered with two sample defects of a very minor nature.  The passenger side vent in the dashboard rattled, and the shelf behind the back seat had a broken mounting clip.  The first I consider a quality-control issue, though I can see it escaping detection as it was inaudible at delivery, but gradually got louder and louder, until I had the vent replaced under warranty this week.  The rear parcel shelf (I think thats what its called) was probably damaged sometime after assembly, and was also replaced under warranty.  With the two noisy problems taken care of, the car is once again a pleasure to drive.

The seats are superb.  Keep in mind, I have the DX model which lacks height and angle adjustment for the lower cushion, and despite that, these are quite possibly the best seats I've ever had in a car.  We also have a 2001 Saturn L-200 (the "big" Saturn) and I just traded a 2002 Mitsubishi Galant, both mid-sized cars with height adjustable seats, but for the business of driving, the seats are better in this Protege.  I'm not saying you will like them, as they are very firm, and they support your body, rather than yield to it, but for long drives I find this preferable to the soft padding of other cars.

The car is noisy.  Wind noise, I believe through the air intakes for both engine and fan, as it is NOT the typical window rustling, is audible from about 65MPG and loud by about 80MPG, depending on the wind.  In the Galant I would cruise in silence at 85 or even 90MPH, which was the car's sweet-spot.  In the Protege, the sweet spot is between 65 and 70MPH, though the car totally capable of higher cruising speeds, only the noise comes along for the ride.  Its not as bad as others have described it, even at 80MPH, but it is present, and coming from the silent Galant, I notice it.

There is also engine noise, though I like this.  On hard acceleration (and this car CAN accellerate), there is a mixture of nice exhaust noises, intake rush and gear whine that really makes me smile.  Every time I mash the throttle, I feel the seat pressed into my back, the steering remain secure and those wonderful mechanical sounds make me completely forget how little I paid.  Honestly, I have driven my friend's 2002 BMW 325i on numerous occasions, and while his car is quieter and more refined, it isn't any more fun to drive, and may be a little less.

I mentioned stiff ride in my review, and that is what really sets the tone for this car.  The suspension is very firm and the tires are low-profile 55-series, which have less cushioning sidewall to absorb bumps than the usual 65 or 70 series tires that come with this class of car have.  You feel the imperfections in the road, and on some surfaces, like expansion joints, it can get a little choppy.  Of course, so does my friend's BMW, stiff suspension is stiff suspension, whether its on an 11 or a 31 thousand dollar car.

The interior is about perfect.  Sure, power windows and the like are nice, and Mazda offers them on the LX and ES models.  The manual locks, mirrors and windows on the DX are in keeping with the spirit of the car though.  This car reminds me of the BMW 2002 or Datsun 510.  Cars with independant AND STIFF suspensions, enough engine power, and no real creature comforts but good basics of seat support and driving position.  The 2003 Mazda Protege is just that kind of car.

Finally, my fuel economy.  My low tank su far is 20.5 MPG of mostly city driving and a lot of brisk accelleration (did I mention this car is fun to drive?), with my high tank right at 30 MPG, which was a mostly freeway tank at 65MPH with the AC off, but some city driving and AC in there as well as some higher speeds.  I'm taking the car to Vegas in a few weeks, so I'll get a better picture of actual highway MPG at that time.  For a car that isn't broken-in yet, I'm pleased with the mileage.  I knew it was no civic (40MPG highway) when I bought it, but am glad to see it is doing much better than my Galant, even after fixing the dragging brakes on that car.
