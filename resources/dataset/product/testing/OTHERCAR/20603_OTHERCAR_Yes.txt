            The Audi A4 is a car owners dream. Handles smooth, looks stylish yet sporty, and is luxurious. The inside is roomy, yet the car is compact. The seats are comfortable. Everything on the dash board is well organized and easy to read. Radio, AC, etc are all easy to access. Its a good car for a family, or just for somebody who needs their space. And if looks could kill... This car sports nice curves, sleek design, and everything you could want in a car. And considering its from audi, its well priced. Its design is very similar to that of the Volkswagon Passat. My advice? GO for it!<br><br>
