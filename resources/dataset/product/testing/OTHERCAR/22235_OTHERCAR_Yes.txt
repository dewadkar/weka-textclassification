            This is the BMW Z3M,

This car is fast.

My girlfriends father bought this car about 1 month ago, It doesn't look a whole lot different than a normal Z3. Same shape, same color schemes, same eye catching design...but after all that's just looks.

The Z3M is a 3.2 liter 240 HP version of it's wimpy little brother. It will take you up to legal speeds before you know it, and it will ultimately result in a speeding ticket if you're not careful. You'll undoubtably pass other Z3's on the highway...laugh at them I did. The Z3M as I consider it has no relation other than looks to a typical Z3. The engine is far bigger(than the first Z3's), the brakes and handling are definitely M Class and it weighs more on performance than image.

This car is easy to abuse, it just begs to be redlined (although I wouldn't recommend it) and loves to be driven carefree, and hates traffic. Enough about the car and it's feelings, let's talk about looks. 

I've heard the words &quot;Shark&quot; and &quot;European Muscle Car&quot; but someone summed it up best when they said &quot;damn!&quot;. It's looks, tight cockpit, clustered dash, and all the pertinent instruments in the right place make for a near perfect ergonomic setup(I have to add that my only complaint is the non-adjustable steering wheel column). Aside from this minor flaw the BMW is an overall best buy in the inexpensive sports car category. If you can afford the upgrade from a mediocre performing Z3 you can pick one up if your lucky enough to find one for around $44,000 US. If you don't have the money...take my advice...don't drive it! It's not worth the flashbacks of &quot;it was almost mine, if I only had the money&quot; 10 years down the road.
