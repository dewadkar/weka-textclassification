            On February 8,1999 my family outgrew our Chrysler Cirrus when our youngest son was born.  We struggled for a month and then test drove and purchased a '99 Dodge Caravan it had four doors and seven seats we thought it was the answer.  My husband was soon disillusioned with the braking specifically and handling in general.  
In June he took me to test drive the new 2001 Montero Limited Edition.  It was love at first sight.  It is muscular and sleek and graceful in a linebacker kind of way.  We bought it that day.  Two weeks later we moved and my playboy turned into a workhorse.  We folded the rear seat into the floor board pressed the middle seats against the back of the front, and loaded it with enough clothes and supplies to last three months in an extended stay hotel.  If we had the Caravan we would have had to leave the seats behind.  
The only thing I'd change about Monte is I'd have the dual AC unit.  It's hot in Atlanta!  
He handles like a dream.  I slip in my favorite CD and the hills and curves disappear behind me.  
If you have a large family, carry a lot of stuff or both; the Montero is for you.  If you don't like to attract attention and cause a sensation at every turn don't buy Monte he is a showboat.<br><br>
