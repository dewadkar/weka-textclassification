            I am fairly happy with this car. I didn't pay a lot for it, and that adds to my happiness. I have experienced many minor nuisances with this car. The windshield wipers are sub-par, constantly needing to be replaced. While driving, I can hear way too much road noise. I constantly think one of the kids have cracked their window. I also have rattling in the door-I think caused from the speaker. All of the weatherstripping is coming off, and that just adds to the amount of road noise I hear. One of the vents has broken on the air conditioning, and my emergency brake has also broken. It will not lock. I pull it up, it falls back down.

You must be thinking I just treat this car horribly. Thing is, I don't. This car is mainly used to take the kids to school and to get me to the grocery. I have been quite easy on this car, and the odd, quirky problems I feel are uncalled for.

Since I began my review with my semi-happiness with this car, I must also state it's good qualities. It is a nice looking, mid-sized family type car. I have never had any problems with the driving abilities, engine, transmission, or any other &quot;major&quot; component. I know I can rely on this car to start in the winter, and I don't worry about getting stuck somewhere and being forced to walk with three kids. The interior is a nice, neutral color and pattern. I also like the abundance of little compartments to keep things. There are enough cup holders for four, which comes in handy for us. It is also roomy enough for myself, my husband, and our three children-one of which sits in a carseat. There is plenty of room in the back seat for the kids, with remaining room on the back floorboard for small packages.

We drove this car on vacation last summer, and did not worry about breaking down. We drove 65mph plus with no shimmies or shakes whatsoever. I don't know the spec's on this car as far as gas mileage goes, but I do know we only had to fill up once during our trip-which is a bit less than usual. 

I think this is a decent economy car which would be much better, in my opinion, if they would just make a few minor changes to improve the quality of the small things that break.<br><br>
