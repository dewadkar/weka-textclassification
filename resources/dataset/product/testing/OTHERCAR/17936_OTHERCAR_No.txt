            I always thought jeeps were cool and always wanted to own one.  But, somehow I never got to buy a jeep.  My dream came true when I was transferred to a new job constructing a section of highway; I was given a jeep that had been barely broken in with 13,000 miles shown.  I drive my car to the office in the morning, then get in my own company jeep to move up and down the 28 miles of unpaved muddy highway construction site all day, logging about 100 miles a day.  

I enjoy the jeep once I arrive at the construction site, although it's not all that fun driving on mud.  The worst part of all this is driving the jeep from my office to the site that stretches 25 miles on paved road.  The jeep is just too noisy (wind), and too unstable (at least it feels) to have any driving fun.  I realize some like trucks and never look into buying a passenger vehicle.  Many likes jeeps.  Now that I know what it is like driving one, I will never ever buy a jeep for my own car.  Don't get me wrong... I don't hate it, but I just prefer a sporty passenger car that is responsive.

OK, the good points... the jeep I have shifts nicely and has a very tight turning radius.  Driving off-road in its 4 wheel drive mode is somewhat fun if done occasionally, but the fear of getting stuck still lingers. Sure, I also like the carefree ruggedness of this jeep.

Cons? Plenty. I am still reading the instruction on how to take the top off.  It might be fun once I get to drive it with its top down, but now the rag top gets too hot in the sun and the plastic windows are very difficult to see through.  Adjusting mirrors require me to &quot;unzip&quot; windows which is a hassle. The rag top contributes to extreme wind noise and this keeps me my speed below 60 MPH all the time. I cannot imagine anyone driving one of these more than 2-3 hours on a highway. With my kind of driving, a full tank of gas (about 12 gallons) gets me about 200 miles on this 4 cylinder model.  Another complaint I have is its gearing.  It has 5 speeds, but each gear is spaced too widely that I can never find the gear I want during off road driving.  It revs too high, or too low, and this makes me to adjust driving speed according to engines rpm, not the road condition.  Storage is very limited too.  I just use my back bench seat as storage.  By the way, the rear seatback folds down to increase storage space.  Mine has poor acceleration, but maybe I am comparing it to my commuter car.

Some will like jeep, some won't.  Test drive 10 minutes and you will know where you fit.  After all, I cannot complain too much at my free company vehicle... The other guys were given SUV's with automatic transmission which I prefer not to have.<br><br>
