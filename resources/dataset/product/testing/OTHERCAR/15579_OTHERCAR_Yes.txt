            I thought I was the only person against buying a new car off the lot. I have been reading opinions on the subject and found other bright people agree.I have bought several &quot;not new&quot; vehicles and feel blessed that they have all been good investments.In 1991 we bought a 1989 Jeep Grand Wagoneer for a great price.It came with a factory warranty and we purchaced an extended one. We later sold the extended warranty back and took a lose.We didn't need it as it didn't cover anything the factory warranty didn't cover.I would advise anyone to READ THE WARRANTIES!!!That Jeep was beautiful and was equipted with everything anyone could want!When we decided the Jeep was too big for the two of us, and ate SO much gas, we traded it in for a 1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass.That was 1993. We got the Cutlass with a full size spare tire at my husband's insistance.He also had them put it up on the rack so he could see if the car had been in an accident and to just have a look around the car. This was to be my car and he wanted to insure my safety.In 1996 I gave him the Cutlass and I went shopping for another &quot;NEW&quot; car.Back to my trusted dealership I went,confident that I would find a good bargain.I found a much older car than I set out to get. This is a 1987 Chrysler New Yorker.I fell in love with it and took it out for three days while I went to several several mechanics to look it over.I just knew this car was too good to be true.Perfect inside and out! It got approval every where I took it! For $5,000 I kept it.I still have it and it still looks great.I have yet to figure out why anyone would pay full asking price for a new vehicle when with a little time they can get a perfectly good one for so much less.Someone else has paid the tremendous asking price and suffered the depreciation.By the time you get the car all the factory &quot;bugs&quot; should have been worked out.Maybe a new car is a status symbol? Keeping up with neighbors or proof of being rich with nowhere else to spend the money? I can think of <br><br>
