            I bought my 1992 Si 4WS (Wheel Steering) in 1998 at 107k miles. I had been wanting one for the longest and found it at 7900 dollars. 

Plastic Radiator: One thing you should know about these cars is that if it has the plastic radiator you should replace it with a metal aftermarket radiator. This is the first investment you should make before mufflers and intakes. It may save your engine from overheating with the resulting damage and thus performance loss that aftermarket parts can&#146t make up for. Mine didn&#146t get damaged but I have heard horror stories about the plastic radiators Honda was using for some years and a car like the Prelude is going to run at high rpms and have additional heat with spirited driving. In fact, one of the warnings when getting one of these is to not get one that got damaged when the radiator went out. In other words have a mechanic take a look at it. 

Frame and Body: Body is low and wide. Must be careful with the front end and take steep inclines/declines at angles. Honda body frames don&#146t take well to accidents so make sure it&#146s not reconditioned (Your better off without it even if you save money). Even if there is no history of recondition look for signs of damage. This body is very low to the ground and the previous driver could have easily damaged the frame without any signs on the body so make sure the car has no alignment problems. Make sure the hood lines up with the body because this would be a sign of damage. If your car has an alignment problem that can not be fixed then you will never be able to use &#147soft&#148 performance tires because they will ruin so fast and keep you from enjoying a great car to the fullest. I&#146m starting to get a bit of rust on sun roof but none on body so it looks like I&#146ll be looking for a used part soon. Still has a beautiful red shine. 

Engine: The engine revs nicely and roars at high rpms like a car costing tens of thousands more. Like any Honda the engine will give you many years of trouble free performance unless you mess it up yourself with aftermarket parts that don&#146t work well with each other. I would suggest getting a full tune up when you get it so you can get a feel of how the car is suppose to drive so you can know if something is lacking later. The muffler that comes standard is great to begin with but I have noticed a few other Preludes that are missing the tips for some reason (I guess they come off). Had a bad oil leak for about a year and was saving to fix it. Come to find out it was the oil filter adapter (Spanish to English translation) and cost 45 dollars parts and labor, now the engine is sealed up at 174k miles. Never had any other problems besides normal maintenance. 

Interior: Its obvious from the first time you look into a Prelude that the rear seat is small. I would suggest you put yourself in the back and someone in the front to see exactly how small they are and see if the car is practical for your needs. I don&#146t try to put people in the back seat unless I don&#146t like them to begin with. I warn people about the back seat and do everything possible to not have someone in the back for long trips. Most of the time people are just happy to be in the car. Front seat passengers, if alone, are never in any need of room and have an excellent view of the road. Gas and Temperature are in the middle of the dash with a clock to the far right. These instruments along with the driver&#146s display of rpm and mph are all under a lip that extends from door to door to provide shadow for contrast of lighted instruments. Lighting control solves any mid day lighting problems well. Something that is common for this model is the door lining made of rubber tends to come off. This can be solved easily and does not represent the build quality of the rest of the car. Overall sitting position is more like a recliner chair than a kitchen table chair because of the overall height of the car. Very comfortable seats make sure you don&#146t hurt your back but getting in and out is a little hard for older people and in some ways it feels exotic. Driver and Passenger airbags are standard along with powerful power windows that have no mercy for anything that gets in the way ie hands.

Tires: One of the best things about this vehicle is how it handles - Awesome. Just about every tire maker has a performance tire or two for this car so things work out well. If you don&#146t have performance tires you are not doing this car justice. I found the best tire that works for me is the Dunlop 9000, very &#147soft&#148 performance tire that lets this car shine. Dunlop 8000 came with the car and didn&#146t do too bad either. 

Audio: Factory radio should be replaced and speakers also. Audio wasn&#146t too great when I got it and I soon blew the speakers; guess my standards were higher than the previous owner or I could just be hard of hearing. Radio Antenna motor went out so I just pulled it out manually and radio works fine (isn&#146t completely broke so why fix it?). The car comes with good spots for audio, 2 on the dash, 2 on the doors and 2 in the back. I customized it so long ago I don&#146t remember sizes of original speakers. My trunk was small to begin with so I put in a box and now I have no trunk.  

Conclusion: The cars looks put a lot of the pocket rockets now coming from Japan and US makers today to shame (guess they hope you don&#146t notice what has been around since 1992). The RSX fills the niche of the Prelude and Integra for Honda but I say Honda should reissue this body or something very close with modern upgrades. I&#146m getting a four door car next to fit more girls for the beach and clubs but this one stays with me for dates and sunny day drives.

Update:
January 17, 2004 Just had to replace starter at 174.5K miles $119 + tax with lifetime warranty. Also found a loose vacuum hose when replacing the starter. Much more meat behind the throttle now. Check those hoses!
