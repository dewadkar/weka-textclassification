            We got a 95 GMC Rally Wagon about 7 months ago because we had out grown our mini-van.  We shopped around for several months before we bought this, but were unable to find anything we liked that was in our price range.  We also had a few car lots 'watching' for vans for us and finally one called and told us they had this.  When we went in to look at it, we were a little disappointed because it only has 2 of the back seats in it, making it an eight passenger instead of the 12 passenger van it was supposed to be.   The space is there for the other seat, but the hook-up isn't.  

We got our van for under $12,000 and it had low miles on it, so it was a great deal. Its also very quiet and rides smoothly. These vans were made to be sturdy and last.  We've not had any trouble at all with ours and the place in the back where the seat is missing is perfect for groceries.  We also put the stroller back there, and in the winter time we put the coats back there so they don't have to be up in the seats, taking up room where the kids need to sit.

The seats are nice and roomy and can sit 3 adults on each bench seat quite easily.  We have 2 car seats on the first bench seat and I'm able to sit there and still have plenty of room.  You are also able to remove the seats in case you need to haul something very large.  



Those are all the good things about the van.  The main thing that isn't so good is the fact that the seats are VERY uncomfortable.  Even though the van is 6 years old, the seats are still stiff and awkward to sit in.  When we went places while I was pregnant, my back would ache from the shape of the seat. Most of the time I had to lie the seat back and stay in a reclining position the whole trip with my feet up on the dash. Still not very comfortable, but much better than sitting up in them.  

Another bad thing about it is that it's high up off the ground and very hard to get into.  There's no running board or step along the side for help.  Try getting up into one of these vans when you're 9 months pregnant!!!  I have a friend  that is a heavy woman and she can't go anywhere with me because she can't get up in the van.  We're going to look into putting some kind of step on the passenger side. Hopefully that will solve that problem.  As for the uncomfortable seats, I guess we'll just have to live with that.
