                 Being a military family, we are always away from our loved ones.  We are constantly traveling, constantly changing mailing addresses, and always missing our families.  The computer had become an important part of our household.  It has become a way to communicate with our family all over the world for a reasonable rate, and sometimes all at once.  
     Now add the digital camera and we can now share pictures of our children, or anything special happening in our lives.   We recently decided that we wanted to purchase one of these wonderful creations and after much thought we chose the Sony Digital Mavica.  
     This camera is Awesome.  The main reason we chose this one was the fact that all your pictures are on a 3.5 disk.  You just put the disk in your camera, find something to take a picture of and click, it is taken.  You then just take the disk out, put it in your computer and there you have it.  Your perfect picture.  You can view your picture and then delete if it didn't come out just right.  No worrying about memory, you just get a new disk.  it has a MPEG movie mode where you can take moving pictures and then send to your loved ones. It charges its battery very quickly and the camera and charger are so portable, there is rarely a missed photo. It has been a godsend for us since we are so far from family and friends.  It makes us feel as though we can share our lives even though we are not right there.
     There are really no limits on what you can do with this camera.  I use it for special events such as birthdays, other holidays and I even use them to take pictures for my auctions.  I absolutely love it and I use this more than the regular 35 mm.  No more running out of film, getting it developed, and then  having to send it or scan it.  Now the pictures are right there and the camera pays for itself in no time.  I recommend this to anyone.  If I can use it, anyone can.<br><br>
