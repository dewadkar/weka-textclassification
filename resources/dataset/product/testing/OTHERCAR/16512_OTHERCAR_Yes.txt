            This is a review of my parent's Acura 3.2 TL.  They have owned the car for almost 3 years now and have driven it 36,000 miles.  I personally have driven the car about a total of 2,000 miles.  The car was purchased as a "certified" used vehicle at an Acura dealership with 44k miles on the odometer.

Initial Impression
The TL is a very handsome car.  The paint quality and trim work are all top-notch.  The styling is not aggressive or daring, but the look is stately.  Chrome trim is found around the window openings, on the grille and around the rear license plate opening.  The chrome work is not overdone to the point of being gaudy, but it does lend a nice luxury look to the exterior.  When looking at the front, the first thing you notice are two large, crystal clear headlights.  Inside the headlamp unit are fog lights, in addition to the high/low beams.  Personally, I love the look from the front.  

From there, things get a little boring.  From the sides and rear, the car looks no more luxurious than the average Honda Accord.  The TL has frameless side windows.  This eliminates the need for traditional steel frames around the windows and, in my opinion, is a great feature.  It makes the car seem slimmer in profile and, as an added bonus, they are easy to clean.

Think of the TL as a personal luxury sedan.  It is very much like a touring coupe but with the added benefit of 4 full doors for occasionally transporting 4 adults.

The Interior
Open the door to the TL and smell the high quality leather.  After a total of 77,000 miles, my parent's TL still smells great inside.  Sit down in the extremely comfortable leather seats and the first thing that you notice is that you are low on the floor.  The driving position is a little awkward.  You sit with your feet almost straight out to reach the pedals.  While it is not annoying, it is something that is noticeable.

The interior is lined in leather and imitation wood trim.  In my opinion, it looks great.  The center console houses controls for the seat heaters and the transmission.  The shifter is "gated," which is a little cumbersome.  Gated shifters are intended to enhance manual shifting, but in a pure luxury car like the TL, it seems a bit out of character.

The dashboard looks good also.  The instruments are very clear and look expensive.  All TLs come with an am/fm,cassette,CD sound system that is easy to operate.  All TLs are also equipped with an automatic climate control.  Set the desired temperature and forget it.  There are three tiny buttons that handle manual control of the climate control system but they are difficult to decipher.  This is not a huge problem though because the system is automatic.  There is a "maintenance indicator" on the dash that turns red every 7500 miles, indicating that it is time for an oil change.  My parents change their oil every 4-5,000 miles so this feature is largely useless.  The cruise control, power mirror switches and sunroof button are all to the left of the steering wheel.  The sunroof control is really cool because you don't have to raise your hand above your head while the sunroof is opening as in many other cars.

The rear seats are just okay.  There is a flip down armrest in the center and the seat is comfortable for two adults.  Having said that, it is important to note that there is not an abundance of space in the car.  When I am in the rear seat (6'0 male), my head is about an inch from the roof.  My knees almost touch the front seat and the feeling is slightly claustrophobic.  Putting 3 adults in the rear would be punishment but for two, the space is adequate.  Further aggravating the situation is the fact that you have to swing your head out of the way quite a bit to clear the roof when sitting in the rear seat. 

For storage, the TL comes with a two-compartment console that will hold about 6 CDs in the lower compartment and several pairs of sunglasses in the top compartment.  The glove compartment will hold the owner's manual and maybe a pair of sunglasses, not much more.  There is an overhead slot for parking garage slips or receipts.  The trunk is fully carpeted and is about average in size.  There is plenty of room for 3 sets of golf clubs or a week's worth of luggage.  There is a small pass-through in the center of the trunk for long objects such as skis.

It is important to note that the TL is missing some features that should be standard on a luxury car in its class.  My parent's TL is fully optioned but does not have:
-A tilt feature on the sunroof
-Memory settings for the power seats
-A high-end stereo such as BOSE
-A trip computer to calculate avg. speed/gas mileage
These are features that my parents did not miss on the test drive, but after a couple thousand miles, they thought that the car should have these features.

Driving the TL
My parents brought the car home from the dealer and let me drive it about 5 miles.  Honestly, I was disappointed.  I was expecting the car to be faster and handle better.  

But then I had the opportunity to drive the car several more times throughout the next year, both for short trips and longer ones, and I can say that this car really grew on me.  The reason it seemed so slow was because it is so silent.  The 200 HP V6 purrs under the hood and is rarely heard or felt.  The transmission is smooth also.  This car has plenty of torque.  It is not fast off the line but this car never strains, even at speeds above 80.  First gear is tall so that there is no jerky 1-2 shift at very low speeds.  The car accelerates to 60 in about 8 seconds.  The TL is slower than many cars in its class but it never fails to please.

The suspension of the TL is tuned to absorb bumps and ride smoothly.  This is not a performance car.  Rather, it is a luxury car with precision handling.  This car will not lose composure over curvy roads in the same way a Lincoln Town car might, but the TL is really not in its element on curvy roads.  What the TL is is an extremely competent cruiser. It glides down the interstate in silence.  The steering is tight and precise.  All you have to do is think about changing lanes and the car responds.  Hit the brakes for an off ramp and the entire car squats.  There is no nose dive like you would find on lesser cars.   Driving the TL makes my ordinary Mitsubishi Galant seem even more ordinary.

Reliability
Change the oil every 5,000 miles, put new wiper blades on it every year, replace the tires every 50,000 miles, put brake pads on every 40,000 miles and change the timing belt every 60,000.  This is an Acura.  Do the routine maintenance and it will treat you well.  There have been NO problems in 77,000 miles.  With a used BMW, Jaguar or Mercedes, there are costly "inspection" services and replacement parts are much more expensive.  This was a very important factor in choosing the Acura over a more prestigious brand.

The Bottom Line
98 was the last year for this body style TL.  In 99, a smoother, much more modern Accord-based TL debuted and has received rave reviews.  It has the BOSE stereo, memory seats and a tilt sunroof.  But I have to think that something was lost in the transformation.  The earlier, 96-98 Legend-based TLs have better roots.  The newer TLs probably do handle better and probably are better values and, for me as a 22 year old, are much more interesting than these older versions.  But I wonder if they really have the "feel" of the older TLs.  It is sort of like old vs. new Mercedes after the Chrysler merger.  The new ones are great, but some intangible quality seems lost in the transformation.  The 98s are incredibly solid cars with a few superficial shortcomings.  They are understated luxury in a good-looking package.  The TL is a perfect getaway car for long weekend vacations, but they seem to be a bit much for use as an everyday family sedan.

My parent's 98 TL sat on the lot beside a newer 99 version, both priced at $18,995.  My dad chose the older model because the new one "looked cheap."  At the time, I thought he was crazy for not getting the latest-greatest.  Now, however, I think that they made the right choice.  I always love having the opportunity to drive their TL because it never fails to amaze me in very subtle ways.
