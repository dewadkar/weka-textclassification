            I have lusted after a new Dodge Ram since the redesigned model made it's debut in '94, and in October of '98 my wish came true.  I purchased a brand spanking new half ton Ram with the stock V6 (Which I only took because I was on a budget and conserned with gas milage.  Glad I was concerned with gas prices what they are now!) It is a forest green regular cab.  About the only options are air, automatic, split bench bucket seats, and cruise/tilt steering.  All in all my '99 Ram cost $17,500.  I personally think that was a really good deal.  The dealership I deal with, Elder-Randal in Marshall, Texas has been FABULOUS.  I have had a few problems with the truck...most of which have been the batteries.  About a year after I bought it, it just died in my girlfriend's driveway.  After Chrysler towed it to the dealership, they found a dead battery.  They replaced it.  2 months later, same thing, same place.  Chrysler pays for a second tow job for....surprise!!! a dead battery.  2 or 3 months later, same thing, same place.  Another tow job...another bad battery.  That seems to be the final battery problem...knock on wood.  Also, I had the same problem a few weeks ago I've been reading about on epinions...the catylitic converter clogged.  However, my dealer had a new one delivered and installed within 2 days.  Also, my V6 engine seems to have trouble shifting into and out of overdrive when the cruise is set.  That too is a common problem.  I get great milage for a truck...about 25MPG.  As an interesting sidepiece, I also own a '90 model 3/4 ton Dodge Ram Cummins Turbo Diesel.  GREAT TRUCK.  If you can afford the Cummins..GET IT!!!<br><br>
