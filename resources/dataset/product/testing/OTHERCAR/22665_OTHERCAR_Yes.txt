            I own a 1978 &quot;Carousel Red&quot; Grand Am, and I absolutely LOVE this car! It's been poorly treated over the past twenty two years, and just about everybody that knows me thinks I should junk it. It'll never happen! You just can't kill that car, I know, I've tried. When I got it from an ex-&quot;boyfriend&quot;, (who will remain nameless), I knew exactly nothing about cars. I couldn't even find the gas tank, which ended up being behind the license plate. So far, we've been through more oil changes and basic tune-ups than I can remember, I drove her for a year without third gear and reverse, and now I have to have the carb. rebuilt, because the thermostat choke plate is stuck open. Living in Texarkana, it gets really cold here for most of the year, and &quot;Red&quot; doesn't like the cold, but she never lets me down. I'm in the restoration process, and although she may not look like much right now, that will change. Those kind of cars were built to last, unlike the sorry excuses they put on the market now! Before I left Dallas, a salesman at the Pontiac dealership on Northwest Hwy. offered to put me in a 1996 Trans Am, if I'd use &quot;Red&quot; as a down payment. Needless to say, I let him know that even though his T.A. was faster, etc., I would never give up the character and personality I enjoy with my baby. I know enough now that I'll be getting my degree in Auto Mechanics in a few years. EVERYTHING I know about any car has come from pure trial and error. It's been a tough road, but I can honestly say that I trust my Pontiac more than any other car on the road. GM really knew what they were doing when they built this particular car.<br><br>
