             I bought this vehicle because it is a sport utility vehicle that is not a monster truck like the competitors such as ford. I am female. I like the way it drives the gas milegage is not bad.  This past April the chrysler/jeep dealerships offered a very good deal on the truck I then did a test drive and was very  satified with the vehicle.it has a lot of room for bags and packages.I like the colors that it is avaialble in. I would recommend this vehicle for someone who wants a truck but doesn't want a monster truck. and also wanted good gas mileage on vehicle. I wouldn't suggest this for someone who wants a big monster truck that has a lot of power and weight. I the only thing that should be different about this vehicle is the design the  that should more away from the box design and try and more oval shape like the Grand cherokee laredo. The price is great even it there is not a special the lease deal is $259.00 which includes everything fully loaded. I just enjoy the feel of the vehicle visability is good and drives well on the road. You are able to fit a large amount of packages in the vehicle. I like the variety of colors they offer. would recommend to female friends who have never purchased a truck before.<br><br>
