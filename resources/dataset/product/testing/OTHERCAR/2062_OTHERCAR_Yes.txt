            I want a digital elph. I can afford the CL20.  No one can find fault with the pictures from this baby! (3x5 4x6)Outpost.com sold mine with a free 8meg CF card! 46 good res. shots on the card and 6 more with internal memory.  The colors are amazing and resolution is good at the high setting.  Don't bother using mid setting- too many jpg artifacts.  This is actually a 1024x768 camera; using the USB download (fast!) starts photo-genie. This zapper pops the image up to 1280x960, removes chunky jpg messes, equalizes and does something secret that fixes realism. For quick snaps and web-camming it's fun. And cheap! $145US- card and all. I don't mind not having an LCD viewfinder as I can move the files into a laptop for checking and deleting. The flash over-exposes real bad when close, but by putting one or 2 layers of tissue over the flash window calms it down for 3 foot shots. I use a baby slave flash ($15) when further than 7 feet away as a bounce off ceiling or wall. I don't miss buying and developing film! Just print the goods and start over. Take 20 shots for 2 goods etc.!! The software works instantly when connected with the USB and shows thumbnails on the screen. You get a much better image with the photo-genie than just copying from the CF. Just don't expect 8x10's!  What else can you buy that will do all this?
