            To tell you the truth, I'm not that big of a Chevrolet fan, much less a pick-up man.  I'm the type of person that likes fast cars, usually made by Ford (Mustang).  But ever since one of my friends purchased a 2000 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Z-71, I have turned over a new leaf.  This truck has it all.  From the engine to the handling and suspension.  It has a powerful 327 V8 and switch on the go 4x4 controls.  The only set-back to this truck is that <i>I</i> don't own one! :)  I would definately switch from Ford to Chevy just because of this truck.  The add-ons are so easy to put on this truck that its wonderful.  You would think that with all the technology that is coming into the picture, it would be near impossible to add anything to any type of vehicle.  It is not true in this case however. My friend, known as <b>wink81</b> on epinions, has added glass paks, echo chambers, a chip, and all other sorts of stuff under the hood.  There are so many things added that I don't even know the names.  I know what you're thinking, you're thinking that the only reason that this truck is so great is because of all the stuff added.  NOT TRUE!  I rode in it before he added all those enhancers and it was still complete power and reliability. I highly recommend the Chevrolet Silverado to anyone.  If you don't feel like buying one, at least go and test drive one!  You will <i>not</i> be disappointed.  Thank you, that is all.
