            I am happy to say I have a 2003 SLK230 Kompressor with optional 5spd/auto TouchShift. It's a 4 cylinder supercharged motor pushing 192 horsepower. I also added heated seats and a 6 disc CD changer.  I was considering a few other cars before choosing the SLK.  But Mercedes offered so much that no other manufacturers did not.  Such as TeleAid, free maintenance and the prestige of being part of the Mercedes family.  I was considering a 2003 Porsche Boxster, but all they give you is a basic warranty and that's it.  Also, a SLK230 loaded is about $49,000, a Boxster loaded is about $61,000, while both have about the same base price.  I tried to check out the Chevrolet Corvette, but the dealers were all extremely rude and because of my young age, treated me poorly, so they lost a $50,000 sale.  
My only problem with my SLK was a faulty AM/FM reception which was promptly fixed by my dealer, and I was happily given a complimentary loaner car.  There is a slight rattle in the passenger door that is barely audible, and not enough of an annoyance to have fixed.  For a hardtop convertible, there is a surprising amount of trunk space with the top up.  Even with the top down, I can fit several small suitcases.  It handles incredibly and braking and avoiding hazardous situations is almost effortless.  Some people are nervous in 2 seater's for fear of a rear impact collision, but I have faith in the safety precautions Mercedes has taken and feel extremely comfortable in all driving conditions.  Performance is better than I expected and it is so much fun to drive.  I only have 6400 miles, but every single one has been a pleasure and 100% trouble free.  I would recommend the SLK to anyone and have recommended Mercedes to many people since acquiring my SLK.  Obviously it's not practical for a family or hauling big items, but if you want fun, prestige, luxury and quality, the SLK is for you! Whether you want a brand new loaded 230 for $49000 or a used model for as low as $18000, you will be extremely happy!
