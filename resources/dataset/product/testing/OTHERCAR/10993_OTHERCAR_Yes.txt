              I bought this 1991 Chevrolet Van EXT.  Because our family was quickly growing and needed something for the whole family to ride conformably in!!! When we purchased this it was the best purchase we had ever made and to this Day it is still the Best!!! Runs good, rides smooth, very few repairs over the 8 years we have owned it.  

  If you are in the Market to purchase a Vehicle for trips, Large Family's, and looking for that economical vehicle this is the Van of your Dreams!!!  Our Van has made trips from Baton Rouge, La. to St. Louis, Mo. Each trip has been Maintenance and worry free.
