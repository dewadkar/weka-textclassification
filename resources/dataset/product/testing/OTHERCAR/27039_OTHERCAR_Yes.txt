            I looked and I looked for the right camera, I had an Epson simple point and shot digital camera but wanted better and the Olympus D-450 Zoom is that camera! It is great in the outdoors and equally good in less than good light with it's two different flash settings! I have shot pictures in the complete darkness and the flash made them come true!
It is very small and you can put it in your pocket. It's easy to use, and doesn't eat-up the batteries, I do use ni-cads and the Nickle hydroxide ones too! Get a USB eFILM READER too worth every penny!<br><br>
