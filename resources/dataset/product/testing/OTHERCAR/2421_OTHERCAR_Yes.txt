                 This vehicle is the greatest!  It has turned out to be fantastic for virtually everything.  5 years old & still going strong.  When we first got this Jeep, it was just my husband & I.  We found this perfect vehicle on a trip out of town.  We returned home with the vehicle, & our puppy also immediately loved the vehicle.  Since then, we have added a second dog, & brought our newborn home from the hospital in it!

     Super mileage, & very versatile vehicle.  This sporty Jeep got us around safely through our first Montana winter.  

     It's quite a feeling to sit behind the wheel in this superb machine.  You feel you have control on the road & off.  No surprises with this one!  The design hugs the road & the interior hugs your curves, making long rides more comfortable & enjoyable for the entire family.  

     The layout of the vehicle is super for those with small to medium families.  We can still take our pet on road trips with us.  We simply installed a pet barrier in the back.  This doesn't detract from the use or look of the vehicle, it gives us & our newborn peace from a bouncing dog, & allows us to keep the space we need for storage, groceries, spare tire, etc.
