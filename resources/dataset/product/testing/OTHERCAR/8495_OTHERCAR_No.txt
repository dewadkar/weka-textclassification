            I've been previously using an Olympus D370 and wanted to upgrade to a camera with optical zoom (if you're thinking about getting a digital camera, and if you want zoom.. which everyone probably will at one time or another, then keep in mind that digital zoom really isn't 'zoom', but just the camera taking a blown up picture, so it's that much more grainy).

I chose a Fuji because a friend of mine had a higher end finepix, and I noticed the picture quality from his camera was a bit better. Also, I had smartmedia cards from my olympus, and wanted to be able to transfer the memory, so it was going to be either another Olympus, or a Fuji (I believe Nikons and Canons use CompactFlash, and Sony's use.. well, Sony's).

<b>CONS: </b>
I bought the Fuji online and took it out of the box. One of the first things I noticed was how thick the camera was. It's shaped more like a cube than a brick. If that weren't enough, the lens acutally *pops out* when it turns on, for the zoom... I was used to keeping my Olympus on, and in my pocket or a pouch, but I coudln't do that with the Fuji.

Another thing I noticed was that it was extremely easy to accidentally delete a picture... usually, when you want to delete it, the default setting for the "are you sure" screen is on "cancel" ... on the Fuji, it's on "okay". I've accidentally deleted one or two pictures this way. 

<b>But it's not that bad..</b>
Other than those factors, though, I'm happy with the pictures that the camera takes for me. Yes, it's a bit harder for me to take the acutal pictures, but I'm happy with the end result. The images are clearer, and the zoom is magnificient (it's nice to actually not have to stare into the viewfinder while I walk closer and closer to something just to get a good picture of it).

Also, there are a few <i>added bonuses</i> - until I bought a set of rechargables, I was buying AA batteries in bulk to feed my Olympus, which used 4 at a time. In contrast, the Fuji needs only 2, AND comes with it's own set of rechargables and a wall charger. (Last I checked, additional rechargable batteries were about a buck each on Ebay.)
