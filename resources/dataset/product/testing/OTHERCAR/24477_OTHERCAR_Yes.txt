            As a Marine, I fly the E/A-6B Prowler where I am used to high speeds. I recently purchased a 98 Viper GTS, my dream car to match my dream job. To sum it up, the Viper is all muscle. It has very little in the line of creature comforts, but then again, WHO CARES??? I am used to being strapped into an ejection seat, so it doesn't bother me to sit in the racing style seat. 
I'll cover the low points of the car to begin with: 

-Tires 
In order to apply the massive amounts of torque that the engine puts out, the tires themselves have to be massive. 335/35ZR17 to be exact. The problem is that the CHEAP tires (Dunlop Sport SP 8000, look up my member name for a review of these tires) still cost over $1000 for 4 installed. It took me the better part of a Saturday to find a place that could mount them onto the rims (17X13) because most tire stores don't have a balancing machine large enough to handle the setup. Having spent over $600 on two rear tires, I cringe every time I unintentionally peel out or when I occasionally drag race the car. I think "well, there went about $50 in tread!" Thankfully, the front tires, 275/40ZR17, are cheaper and can be installed easily at most tire stores. Also, the tires are not meant to be driven on wet surfaces. They do ok, but you can easily lose control if you aren't careful when its raining. 

-Repairs 
My local Dodge dealer has a Viper Tech on staff in order to work on the vehicle. Daimler Chrysler mandates that for a Dodge dealer to sell a Viper, they must be a 5 star dealer and have an in house Viper Tech. I took the car in one day to have the oil changed, only to find out that they can't do it for me since the car was too low to be put on a lift! Since they work on so few, they told me I had to find another dealer. So, I took it to the auto hobby shop at MCAS Cherry Point and found a way to get the car safely on a lift (that process took 5 minutes.....so much for the well trained Viper Tech) and I changed the oil myself. The engine takes 9 QUARTS of Mobil 1 full synthetic. All in all, each oil change runs $60 if I do it myself. The point to take away from this is that nothing runs cheap on this car when it comes to maintenance. 

-Fuel Economy 
12 mpg city/20 mph highway running on 93 octane premium. Needless to say its expensive to fill up and drive. 'Nuff said. 

-Difficult to drive 
The car is basically a street legal race car. It is by no means designed to be driven by a teenager or anyone with limited driving experience. As a 30 year old jet pilot, I am trained to think ahead and respond to high speeds. I routinely fly close to the ground in excess of 500 MPH. Having said that, the car scares the heck out of me still. I drag race the car on occasions (at a track.....NOT on the street) and it takes every bit of concentration to drive it in a maximum performance scenario. As far as just driving the speed limit, on a dry day, and being careful, it isn't that bad. But, the car isn't meant to be driven like that and you can easily get caught up in the adrenaline rush that its acceleration provides. 

-Parts 
Since the car is fairly rare, and since my model is discontinued in favor of a new style, parts are hard to find and VERY expensive. Something that may run a few hundred dollars on a Mustang costs a few thousand for a Viper. I had to replace a side door window seal and it cost me over $300!  I hit a dog with it while going to work one day, and the repair costs were $3600 for a bumper and a headlight (animal lovers, don't worry, the dog lived and will be ok).  Vendors claim that "R&D costs" are to blame, but I say that people assume that if you are willing to drop $40-100K on a car, you won't mind. 

So far I have focused on the negative, but the car has many positives as well. Here is what I have noticed in the 6 weeks I have owned it: 

-Power 
450 HP/490 lbs-ft of torque. STOCK! The car will do 0-60 in a little over 4 seconds and run the 1/4 mile in a little over 12 seconds @120 MPH. The top speed is somewhere around 190. Considering that you'd have to pay 3-4 times as much for an Italian exotic to match this, its pretty darn incredible. I ran the 1/4 mile in 12.9 @116 MPH on street tires with a clogged air filter. I also don't know how to drive the car to its full potential, so I fully believe the manufacturer's estimates of the low 12's (assuming that slicks were used instead of street tires). The amazing thing is that I didn't need to shift out of 3rd gear on any of my runs! The torque is so powerful that my last 1/8 mile is where I make the most speed. Over time, I plan on adding performance parts as I get the extra money. I installed a K&N air filter and smooth bore package and instantly noticed the difference. With that small mod, I probably gained 10-15 HP and dropped a couple tenths off my 1/4 mile time. The next upgrade is a complete exhaust swap out that will boost me another 50 HP. 

-Looks 
In my mind, there are few cars that are better looking than the Viper GTS. Mine is red with silver stripes. I turn heads everywhere I go and receive compliments about the car no matter where I am. Having said that, the cops love to look at my car as well! I haven't been pulled over yet, but I dread the day when I get a ticket for doing 56 in a 55 JUST BECAUSE its a Viper. That's the main reason I don't speed on the streets or street race. 

-Shelby legacy 
The original Viper was based off the 1965 427 AC Shelby Cobra. The GTS was based off of the 1965 Shelby Daytona Coupe that the Shelby team beat the Ferraris with (an almost unheard of feat for that day and age). The Viper is a tribute to a man who dedicated his life to racing and represented the sport almost better than anyone. 

-Collectable car
The car has held its value fairly well over the years. The original MSRP was around $66k back in 98 and still books for around $48K. In time, I am betting that the car will follow the Corvette lead and start appreciating again in 10 years or less. While this is a car meant to be driven, not garaged as an investment, it will only get better with age. 

-Joy to drive 
Although it is very difficult to drive, it is also very fun. I can have the worst day and only need a short drive to make me feel better. The car to me represents a dream that I fulfilled. Another check in the box, so to speak. The attention I get is very amusing, albeit annoying at times (everyone wants to race me or to ask me the same questions over and over). Still, I wouldn't trade it for anything. 

Overall, the car is everything I expected and then some. I did list a lot of negatives, but I want people to understand that this car is not for everyone. To parents with teenagers, I say don't even think about it! The insurance alone would break the bank (mine is low due to being over 30 with a clean record). But, to that speed junkie who is used to performance, I say there is no substitute.
