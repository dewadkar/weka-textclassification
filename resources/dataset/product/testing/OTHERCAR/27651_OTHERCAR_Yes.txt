            I brought my Accent with 12 miles on it Brand spanking new in July of 95 . It is a 4 door Accent with just a am/fm cass , 5 speed and air. Out the door it cost 11k new.  It was my first brand new car and let me tell you I'm sold on Hyundai ...

This car has had No let me restate that NO repair costs. The only things done to it were regular maintenance. Other than the water pump that was replaced when the timing belt was replaced. The timing belt was replaced at 120k , I pushed it the manual says replace it at 60k ,and while they had the water pump off I figured what the hey have it replaced . The other regular parts replaced were , head lamps ( one went out so I replaced both ) , front brakes (it still has the rear pads with half life left on them ),battery (that lasted 5years, not bad for a factory battery and it might have lasted longer if the water didn't run dry in it ), tires, wiper blades , lots and lots of oil changes , driver seat cover (replaced under warranty), center armrest console (replaced under warranty a few time ) plugs and wires . That's about all i can think about off the top of my head . The center armrest console didn't stand a chance under my 250lbs .It didn't last long and I never replaced it after it went out of warranty. It was rather flimsy and was small and never stood a chance :)..The car has never left me on the side of the road other than the cheap tires I put on it shredding.

Handling was good in this car but high winds would tend to blow it around . Braking was good for the car . Lets face it is an entry level car so it isn't going to break any records , but for a 2nd car or a first car with little out of pocket cost it is a good buy . 

Front seat room is great . Six footer's can ride in the front all day and have plenty of room but the back seat can be alittle cramped if the front seats are all the way back . Hip and shoulder room is ample unless u have two 250lbs people in the front then it can be alittle cramped .

With the 95 Hp motor it doesn't have with a full load and an auto trans. . So if you a large person I wouldn't go with the auto . Stay with the 5 speed . With the 5 speed it has alot of pep off the line and has no problems doing 80 on the highway . 

Road noise at highway speeds can be alittle loud but it is an entry level car that can be expected. With the windows down it is worse . Good thing the ac will still freeze you out of the car . I live in a part of the country where 110 is not uncommon in the summer and the ac handles it without a problem . Matter of fact you have to turn it down to the first setting if you aren't in direct sunlight or you will be downright cold .  

Even with 160k on the car is still gets 35 on highway and 30 around town . Leaks and burns no oil and has just pass smog in CA with no problems. 

If you are looking for a cheap used car I think an Accent is a great buy . Because of the very bad resale value you can get them very cheap . I am talking 1-2k for a 95 . For a kids first car or for a commuter how can you go wrong with that . Change the timing belt if it has over 60K on the motor and you are good to go . 

This is the first generation or Accents and 95 was the first year . Why I bought a first year car I have no idea but I am glad I did. It has been one of the best cars I have ever owned. It has moved on to my son and I purchased a 2002 Elantra GT and man what a great car . But that's is another story .

As for Hyundai go test drive one . Rent one for a weekend and put it to the test . Don't listen to me or anybody that says they are great or they are the worse , go see for yourself .
