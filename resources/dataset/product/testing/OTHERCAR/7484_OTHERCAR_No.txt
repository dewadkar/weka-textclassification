            I purchased the vehicle for it's looks. Toyota pick-ups are Sharp looking, and styling.

I loved the function being up-close to the driver. Everything was with-in reach. The maintenance service is costly for such a little truck. Finding a reliable mechanic is a nightmare. I had problem with the vehicle, took it back to the dealer where I purchased it (Toyota Of Vero Beach). They found the problem, and attempted to repair it. It ran worst than before having any service done to it. I ended taking it to Fort Pierce Toyota now know as Bev Smith Toyota. The had the vehicle fixed and back to standards quick.

The truck is fun to drive in short trips around town. It will hurt your lower back if you go on a long trip.

Anyone who is going to use it locally should buy it. Do not buy if using for long distance.<br><br>
