            We bought our Oldsmobile Sihoette about six months ago, used. It is a 1997.  The van itself is just gorgeous.  This particular model even has leather seats.  We just love the way it looks.  It has also never had to be serviced in the six months we have owned it.  But, it has a few glitches that, after reading some other reviews, i see are quite common with this make and model.  

Firstly, our automatic sliding door has a mind of its own.  There are times we can't get it to stay shut for anything.  We shut it, it opens itself right back up, we shut it again, same thing.  My husband has to get out, mess around with it and shut it manually to get it to stay.  The odd thing is, the next day, and for the next week, it is fine.  Weird.  

Secondly, the locks are weird.  It is a totally pain to have to be in park, with break on to get doors to unlock and to use automatic door. It would be nice to pull up to the school and let the kids out without shutting the whole car down practically.

Other wise, this is a great vehicle.  Very pretty and runs well.  I will buy Oldsmobile again but maybe try another model next time.<br><br>
