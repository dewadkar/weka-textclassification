            The lease was running out on my wife's Acura 3.0 CL in March, so it was time to go car shopping. After evaluating what was available, she decided she wanted a four-door luxury sedan. 

My wife only drives about 50 miles per week, so we decided that rather than lease another car, we would purchase a high-quality automobile that we could keep for many years. After evaluating all the options and test driving a few cars -- such as the Volvo S60, the Acura TL and the Lexus ES300, we chose the Infiniti I30. After negotiating with the dealer, we got the price down from the sticker price of $30,4000 to $28,000 including destination charges.

To date, the car has been wonderful. The 227-horsepower V6 engine provides plenty of power and the car handles very well on the twisty roads near our home. There is plenty of interior room for me -- a 6-foot, two-inch tall driver, and my wife is able to adjust the seats and mirrors to a driving position that is comfortable for her too. The seats are very comfortable, the Bose sound system is superb.

Dealer service is excellent and we get another I30 as a loaner when we bring the I30 in for any service, including a routine oil change.

Infiniti is replacing the I30 with the I35 for the 2002 model year. The I35 will be identical to the I30 except it will have a 260 horsepower engine, a front end that looks more like a Q45, and a heftier price tag. Until then, dealers are offering some excellent prices on new I30s. Save some money and get the I30....you'll never miss the extra 33 horsepower.
