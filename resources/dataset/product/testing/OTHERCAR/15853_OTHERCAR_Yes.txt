            Bear in mind it's my understanding that the 1999 GMC Suburban is unchanged from the 1998.  So if you're looking for a used 1998, or a 1999 (there's a lot of 1999's still on the dealer lots and I think with very good rebates) hopefully this information will assist you in making a good decision.  My GMC Suburban is a 1998.

Being a person who likes a 4X4 in general, and likes to surf fish (some of my fishing rods are 12 to 15 feet long (use a ski rack) and I have several tackle boxes), I wanted a Suburban for a long time.  My GMC had a sticker price of about $40,500, plus that I added about $1500 in dealer installed options.  And don't forget taxes, adding about another $2000.  

I didn't want one off a dealers lot, so I ordered one.  In spite of the fact that I ordered it on 11/01/97, and it didn't arrive at the dealer until 03/98 (about 4 months), I'm still glad I did.  The vehicle feels like it was made just for me.  

One choice I didn't have.......Suburbans are manufactured in Wisconsin and Mexico.  Mine was manufactured in Mexico, and I wish it would have been manufactured in the good old USA.  I personally think there's a positive difference.  

This vehicle will be 2 years old in March, 2000.  I haven't spent any money on it except gas, general maintenance, and brakes.  Suburban's are known for their somewhat short life brakes.  I was told that they last, on average, about 20,000 - 22,000 miles.  I try not to make hard stops, and I did get about 31,500 miles on the front disc brake pads.  I had the rotors turned when replacing the pads.  I replaced the original pads with Raybestos Super Stops which come with a very good guarantee.  The rear brakes were checked, and looked very good.

I've never gotten real good gas mileage, but I didn't expect to.  The average was given as 12 - 18 mpg.  The best I've gotten is about 15.5 mpg.  I installed a set of Bosch Platinum +4 spark plugs and a K &amp; N Air filter.  They seem to help gas mileage some, and also performance.  If I use regular gas around home, I get about 12.5 mpg.  If I use 94 octane, I get about 13.5 mpg, and it runs a lot better.

To me, driving this vehicle is not unlike riding down the highway on your living room couch.  Plus that, you feel safe.  Parking it hasn't been a problem for me, but I do tend to park away from others because I don't like the side of my GMC scratched or dented.

I'm looking forward to driving the Ford Excursion and the new 2000 GMC Yukon XL.  But, they will have to be very good vehicles to be better than this one.  I just plain old like this Suburban.

If you're someone who needs or likes a lot of space, or you like to take your kids and their spouses with you, if you have a lot of &quot;stuff&quot; to carry around, if you like a larger size vehicle, then a Suburban is for you.  Personally, I'm very pleased with it.

Although there was a noise connected to the rear leaf springs, they were replaced under warranty.<br><br>
