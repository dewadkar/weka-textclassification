            Haggling can have it's place and time, depending on your haggling skills. For the past few weeks I have been haggling with both a local Ford-Lincoln-Mercury dealer and an Oldsmobile dealer. EVERY trick my fiance warned me of they tried to pull over my eyes. Even when I specifically asked them to just give me the price of the CAR - no trade-in, no downpayment - JUST the price of the car, they still couldn't do it. They were constantly trying to trick me into thinking that I was getting a good deal by working in these other factors and never being straight with me. Not only that, but they wanted me to have a co-signer and wouldn't be able to give me anything better than about 10% APR.

So, I go to Saturn and have a wonderful experience. The sticker price is reasonable and fair. There's no haggling going on. And they ALSO gave me a fair deal on my trade-in (which the other two "regular" car dealers were not too keen on doing).

Everybody at Saturn was so incredibly friendly and supportive, I was overwhelmed. Being my first new-car buying experience, I was nervous and wanted to make sure I wasn't cheated out of anything. And I got just what I wanted.

I want to take this opportunity to let everybody know that the Saturn dealer I dealt with, in Tallahassee, Florida, was exceptional and I would encourage any prospective car buyers to give Saturn a chance when looking around.
