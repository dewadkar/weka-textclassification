            I live in Canada, so figured it would be important to have an AWD vehicle.  The wife has an AWD Subaru Legacy that performs well, but I wanted something a little more luxurious.  So I leased this car two years ago from a Canadian dealer.  It is a nice car (quiet, with a great stereo).  It's a great ride.  It's fun to drive. The 2.7 Turbo provides lots of power and it handles well.  The power not only means that you can blow the doors off other cars, it allows you to jump onto the highway on an uphill grade in the mountains, and easily accelerates quickly and quietly.  It's very comfortable for short or long trips.  The way the lights dim up and down and the way the stereo return to low when you turn off the car all seem trivial, but are nice touches.  Performance wise, this is a nice car.

One of the most helpful pieces of information about the car for me is driving another car for a few days, like a rental car.  Then I come back to the Audi impressed by it's power and handling.  I really feel that the A6 is under my control at all times.  Compared to the rentals, the steering is tight, the acceleration strong and the brakes are powerful.

As for the AWD handling, it's fairly helpful.  The first year I owned the car, though, it had summer tires and slid around terribly (why a Canadian dealer would install summer tires on an AWD sedan in the first place I don't understand).  The second year I got some great 4 season Michelins that really do a great job in the snow.  That's to say (1) tires are more important than AWD, but (2) AWD helps.

There is one major problem with the vehicle, though -- the front end is too low.  With most cars, you pull into a parking stall until your tires hit the little cement stop.  But not with an A6.  Instead, you stop before the front bumper hits, or it will get scraped off, but only when you back out.  It's surprising how difficult it is to judge the distance, look out for hidden objects, and make sure you don't get a little "roll" in when you stop.  Perhaps  this problems could be improved by the optional 17 inch wheels.  For my last 6 months, a little duct tape held the front bumper on -- a nice touch on a $40,000 car!  For more information, see the NHTSA site: http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/complain/ (Check for the 1999 Audi A6 models).

I would also weigh in with other owners who find the dealerships not up to snuff.  Although I realize that dealers are independent of one another, I think the fact that several reviewers have complained about them to be a concern.  Mine makes it almost imposible to schedule the regular "included service" (takes most of a day on the phone playing phone tag), requires a month lead time for a loaner (promised when I bought the car), and sometimes, even after all that the loaner isn't available, and the oil change requires a wait from 8 'till 5 (despite a promise to be done by 10).  All in all, if you buy a luxury car I think you deserve luxury car service (that sees pre-paid service as a benefit of ownership and not an unreimbursed cost to dealers).  

I would very much like to see Audi fix the bumper problem in later models.  But having seen a 2002 "Allroad" I don't think they will.  I'd also like to see them upgrade the quality of service from the dealers.  Therefore I can't quite recommend the car.  The car itself is nice.  And you can't get much better for the price these days.  This year's enlarged A4 with the 3.0 is probably a better value.  But watch out for the front bumper!  How Audi can engineer such a great car and notice all the little things like dimming lights and a stereo that returns to low but ignore important things like the front bumper, tires, and dealers beats me. 

The fact that Audi hasn't fixed the bumper in 3 years of production convinced me not to buy another.  I just bought a new Subaru Outback 3.0 (Eddie Bauer).  With the upgraded engine, leather, CD changer, it's almost as nice as the Audi.  But now I can pull into parking spots without having to pay close attention to the front bumper.  And I don't have to drive around with a 40 thousand dollar car with a bumper held on with duct tape.  It bespeaks a lack of concern that troubles me.  I think that if Subaru made a bumper error like Audi, they would commit hari-kari!  At least they would have the honesty to recall the car.
