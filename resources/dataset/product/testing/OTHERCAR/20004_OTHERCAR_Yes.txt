            I had driven Toyota cars for years, starting with the Corolla, then on to a sporty Celica and a 4-cylinder Camry.  I also had the pleasure to ride in Acura and BMW.

When it was time for a new car about 2.5 years ago, I was looking at BMW 3-series, Acura, Nissan Maxima, and Lexus ES-300.  I decided on the ES-300 for its front-wheel drive handling in snowy weather (having experienced spins in rear-wheel drive BMW 3-series on icy roads).  Also, the interiors of the BMW and the Acura were not as soft and luxurious as the Lexus.  I felt that the Maxima was a good car but is not in the same class.

We put over 45,000 miles on it since the day we bought it and it still is a very beautiful and solid car to drive every day.  The engine is surprisingly very strong and fast, and the stereo system is terrific.  You'll hardly feel the acceleration going from 55 to 85 mph as you weave your way in Interstate traffic.  It's so quiet and smooth, the only indicator is your speedometer.  The leather is top-notch and the seats are better padded than the BMW and the Mercedez.  The steering column is thick enough and the white-on-black dashboard is a classic Lexus signature.  It's a pleasure to stare at in daylight and night time, very different from the red-on-red BMW cockpit look.

Lexus service is the best in the business.  And the resell value of the car is terrific.  I highly recommend the Lexus ES-300 for those who want a quality, high-performance sedan that allows you to relax in pampered luxury, rather than a muscle-bound Teutonic sports sedan.

The only complaints I have are the outdated remote control.  How come the RX-300 gets the built-in control on the key itself and not the ES-300?  Also, the optional traction control is a little too sensitive at times on snowy and rainy days.  There are times when I want direct control over steering rather than some computer chip assistance.
