            <b> Introduction </b>
I purchased this camera back at the first of January 2002 online from B&H Photo Video. I paid $699 for the camera. I also purchased the following items:

* B-50SU AA NiMH Rechargeable Batteries (4 Pack) w/ Charger
* B-01 AA NiMH Rechargeable Batteries (4 Pack) 
* ImageMate SmartMedia Single Slot USB Card Reader/Writer  
* Sandisk 128MB SmartMedia Memory Card 

My final package price (including shipping) was $866.75.

The cam comes with a set of disposable batteries. These lasted me about 4 days. I took nearly 400 pictures over those 4 days. You will definately want at least 2 sets of rechargeable batteries... maybe 3 if you travel a lot. To date I've taken well over 1000 pictures with the camera. Grant it, most of them are 'experimental' and have been trashed. 

<b> The camera </b>
There are plenty of other descriptions on here about how the cam is, and I'll just say that it is built very solid. It feels much better in my hands than my buddy's Fuji Finepix 4900. The C4040 buttons are in good ergonomic locations and are easily accessed in most normal picture taking situations. The LCD is useless outside in the daytime when it's sunny, but that's to be expected of any LCD screen. 

I didn't realize how 'non usable' a 3X zoom is. The Finepix 6x zoom is much better. I wish the 4040 had a 6x optical zoom. Digitial Zoom is useless and adds grain to the picture. Leave it turned off. If you know you're going to be  taking a lot of pics where you'll be taking close-ups (ie if you're a concert goer and such) you'll definately want to go with a cam with better zoom.

The response time from when you hit the button to when the image is recorded to the media card, depends vastly on the image quality which you have chosen. The TIFF's take about 30 seconds, while the JPG's take between 5-15 seconds depending on the quality level you have chosen.

<b> Features </b>
This is my first ever 'real' camera. I've had those cheapo 35 mm cameras before that cost like a hundred dollars, but nothing like this.  I personally found the menu structure intuitive and easy to figure out. Everything seems to make sense. I've been experimenting with manual mode a lot lately and the things you can do are amazing. 

<b> Using it </b>
For inside shooting there are 3 built in ISO settings, 100, 200 and 400. 100 and 200 look good, but the 400 setting introduces a lot of grain and into the picture. Recently I was in DC, and a lot of the museums up there had places where you couldn't use a flash, so I upped the ISO setting to compensate and most of those pics came out looking ok. If you had a regular camera loaded with ISO 100 film, you'd be out of luck.

There are all kinds of picture settings you can work with. TIFF's are huge and totally unrealistic for the average user. HQ or SHQ settings yield images in the 2200 x 1700 range and these are suitable for printing 8 x 10's. A 128 MB card will hold about 140 of these pictures at a time.

A great feature is the easy 'auto' timer. Just go into the menu, select that drive feature, and once you hit the 'take' button, you'll have 10 seconds to get in position before the picture is taken.

<b> Focus Problems? </b>
This may be all in my head. It seems to me that when I take 'wide' scenery shots, they always turn out just a little bit blurry. For instance the pics of the Washington Monument from the Lincoln Memorial (F10,1/800) are fuzzy around the trees. It's not totally crisp and clear.
I've noticed there are sharpness settings within the menu's but I haven't messed with that yet.

Close up shots and medium range shots look simply fantastic. It's the wide shots that disappoint me.


<b> Final Recommendations </b>
I hope this review has been helpful to you. Overall the camera takes excellent pictures. I highly recommend this camera for the novice photographer who wants a camera that takes high quality pictures suitable for printing out. Buy one now! The price is even lower than when I bought it!
