            This year model is superior to the &quot;new&quot; Concorde in every way,except horsepower. It feels bigger, drives bigger, rides great and with the factory optional handling package (16&quot; wheels, stiffer shocks and bigger sway bars and speed-proportional steering)it handles better. Don't know why Chrysler tinkered with a good thing, but the previous platform and body is superior to the new one. The styling on the new Concorde's is a little over the top, for me. My '96 has 92,000 miles, one repair (a lousy a/c coil, see below), regular maintenance and is on only its second set of tires. Watch out for used models that didn't get a replacement a/c condenser coil under warranty. The original is a piece of junk that will develop leaks.<br><br>
