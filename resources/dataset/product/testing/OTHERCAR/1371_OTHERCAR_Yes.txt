            My experiences with an Eagle Talon aren't lovely ones.  I bought an Eagle Talon a little while ago and all it has been is trouble.  I have to replace things, fix things, and remove things that shouldn't be there.  Yes, the Talon is an eye catcher, but the time and money you will have to spend fixing this car is overwhelming.  I have had to put new brakes in it, new boots that drive the car, fix the power stearing, etc... The outside of the car has been falling apart.  The company that made the car made things stick with little clips, which don't hold the parts very well.  The Talon gets decent gas mileage, but because of the engine being high strung, it wastes a lot of gas shifting.  I would not buy this car if I was you.  It has been nothing but complete and utter missery.  Eagle Talons are just cars that eat up your money and fast.  <br><br>
