            I have owned my 1999.5 Infiniti QX4 for about a year now and I love it.I also checked out the Lexus and the Mercedes truck and found that Infiniti gave you the most extras for the money. They were also willing to negotiate a fair price for it. I find the ride to be very much like riding in a car. I love my heated seats which work really well on cold days. I haven't had any problems with the truck since I purchased it. People who should buy this truck are people who are used to driving sedans and want to give a SUV a try. People who shouldn't buy this truck are people like the feel and ride of a rugged SUV. I would buy this  SUV again. <br><br>
