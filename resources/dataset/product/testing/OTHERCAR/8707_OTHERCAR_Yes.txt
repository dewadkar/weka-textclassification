            Right now I drive a Honda Accord, 89 edition.  I love it.  I'm about to upgrade and after test driving several 2000 Accords I decided to remain loyal to Honda and buy one.  These cars have the most comfortable seats I've ever sat in and the steering is unbelievable.  
This car responds to the lightest touch but it's almost impossible to oversteer - it's almost like the Accord knows where to stay on the road free from any direction by the driver.  This car pratically drives itself.  
The only complaint I had was the slight engine noise that I didn't find in other cars.  Only at high interstate speeds was I able to hear the engine and turning the radio just a little fixed that.  
The 89 was my first car and I had no trouble with it.  My parents also loved it so I'd recommend this car (or any older model - I've had minimal problems with mine) to anyone that wanted one.  They're easy to drive and comfortable for long trips.  <br><br>
