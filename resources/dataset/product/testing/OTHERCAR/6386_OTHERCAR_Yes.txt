            The demand for this car is still extremely high, and we had to order and wait couple of months. At first, we weren't sure if we can afford the car, especially with the hefty premium, but we were able to get it at least at MSRP after claiming that a few internet dealers were selling it for at least $5000 cheaper than what my dealer asked for. I'm glad we bought it now. It has enough room for a growing family (We just had our first baby last year), and a peace of mind with the industry leading safety features. 

The styling is awesome. It's unique, with class and character. The interior styling is luxurious and contemporary. It almost feels like we are sitting in a showroom of a Scandinavian furniture store. 

I haven't test driven the 2.5T, but my T6 has enough torque to easily pass others on the freeway. The car is quite heavy, and I can feel it when breaking hard or when rolling down a hill. I can feel its inertia.

I don't have enough experience with other premium SUVs, but I think it is extremely quiet. Before, when we were driving the Honda CR-V (98), I had to shout to talk to the passenger in the back when driving on the freeway (especially since I had the roof rack), but now I can almost whisper! I also have the Dolby Pro Logic 2 surround stereo, which really works well.  

The transmission is excellent. It is smooth and quiet. The geartronic works well too. It is fun to use, but I wish it was a 5-speed instead of 4, because with only 4, it doesn't require much shifting.

I car is big (of course much smaller than the Expedition or the Navigator) and I'm having difficulty parking it at times in Hawaii, where almost all of the parking stalls are compact. The parking distance sensor is a must have. It's quite accurate. The automatic folding side mirrors are nice too.

The seats are fully powered on both front seats. You can really change a lot with these seats, including height, and you also have the telescopic steering wheel. I guess it is standard among luxury cars, but I really like the seat position memory function, because my wife's seating position is quite different from mine. The middle seat in the second row, has a built-in child booster seat, so it does not have much cushioning. You might not want to use it for a long interstate trip. The third row seats are not for big guys, but I'm 5'7" and I can sit quite comfortably with the second row seats move forward a little. The third row also has its own air conditioning outlet. 

The gas mileage isn't great. I guess that is understandable considering its weight. The T6 (which I have) is heavy enough to qualify for the heavy-truck tax incentive for business owners. On average, I get about 15.7 mpg on my trip computer. It's quite painful with rising gas prices. 

The split tailgate looks nice, but it makes it difficult to unload objects from the cargo area without actually climbing onto the car. The lower tailgate opens up by flipping down, so it makes it harder to reach objects that have rolled forward.
