            I bought this car in October after reading the reviews here and I must say I LOVE IT!!. I went from a BMW 323IC to this and I personally think it drives better.

I got the V6 4 motion which comes with lots of luxury features like volume controls on the steering wheel, side windows fold in at the car wash, right mirror dips when in reverse, heated leather seats, drivers memory seats, automated windshield wipers

Comments from friends who have driven my car: "wow its so roomy", "i love the violet lights", "its like flying a plane", "this is most definitely my next car", "geeze i nearly broke my neck, when i touched the pedal the car leapt forward", "Who would believe it has more legroom front & back than my mazda millenium".

I'm 5'10" and i can fit in the trunk. The car makes the most effective use of space. I've gotten several comments even at the carwash.

If you are considering buying this car GO FOR IT!! The V6 4 motion also drives great it in the snow. Its great!! !
