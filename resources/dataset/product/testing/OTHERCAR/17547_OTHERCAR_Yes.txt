            I believe that this is the perfect vehicle to buy.  It's great for all the different seasons.  In the summer you can go with the top off and have the convertible.  In the winter you have a four wheel drive that has no problem with snow, ice, or any other natural problems.<br>The soft top is very easy to operate and takes one person about fifteen minutes to completely convert and store everything away.  One draw back is that once you have the top off, where do you put the windows that zip out and tops of your doors.  The Jeep does not have a mass amount of storage.<br><br>The Wrangler is also not the best vehicle to take on the interstate for a long period of time when you have the three speed automatic, it is rather hard on the engine.  The engine does have respective power for the size of the vehicle, and I don't loose off of the line to often.<br><br><br>
