            The C230 is an amazing automobile.  From the early beginnings of wheeled transportation this vehicle has embraced all that is fun and safe in motoring.  The C230 Kompressor is a very agile handling and peak performance machine.  It is a comfortable and very safe vehicle that gives the occupants a very involved ride.  The vehicle is perfect for those discriminating drivers that want to drive a quality automobile but not a land cruiser that handles like a tank.  Every detail of the car is finished correctly and there are no areas where the builders skimped on the materials or workmanship.  It is fun to give tours of the new C230 to friends showing all of the creature comforts like the rear headrest drop button, programmable garage door opener buttons, and other convenience appointments.  The vehicle handles and performs like MB owners have come to demand.  It will leave many behind at the traffic lights as well cruise comfortably down the interstate.  Gas mileage is not the best for a vehicle in this class and it imbibes on premium fuel.  The front wheels seem to gather an inordinate amount of brake dust as a minor nuisance.  There are not many colors to choose from but the vehicle looks good in all that are available.  For those considering a lease the residual is high (50 + %) over a four year period which opens some options to seriously consider at the end of the lease.  We considered the Cadillac Catera, the Lincoln LS and the Volkswagon Passat.  All were intriguing in their own ways but the star on the hood brought us back to where we wanted to be.<br><br>
