            I bought my 1993 Volkswagon Euro Van used, in 1996.  When we were looking at &quot;minivans&quot;, We'd looked at and test drove every minivan we could find, not liking any of them until we tripped upon this beauty!  

We were a family of 6, with one in a carseat, driving two vehicles everywhere.  None of the other minivans could fit the carseat in it and have room for the other kids to get in and out without having to climb over or around it, and the backend storage areas were so tiny!!  In all of the other minivans, we were all squished together like sardines in a can!

The Eurovan was sitting in a side lot of the 10th car dealership we'd been to in one weekend, and out of curiosity, I walked over to it and peeked in the window.  (It had just been traded for another vehicle the day before) I fell in love!!  This is NOT your typical &quot;minivan&quot;!!!  There was seating for 7, enough room for each to have some &quot;space&quot; while traveling, LOTS of legroom, and the back storage area was HUGE too!  Lots of room!!  After I test drove it, and we &quot;test drove&quot; the carseat space and the kids got in and out without a struggle, I WANTED IT!!  We bought it that day! (Little did we realize that soon after we bought it, the 7th seat would also have a carseat in it!!)

The only drawback to my model is that it's standard, but that also prevents anyone who can't drive stick from &quot;borrowing&quot; it. &gt;grin&lt; Other than that, I have no complaints about my EuroVan.  Volkswagon guarantees the brakes for up to 100,000 miles before they need changing, and the muffler is lifetime warranteed, not to mention, it gets great mileage and is wonderful on oil.  If I were to ever buy another &quot;minivan&quot;....it would DEFINITELY be a Volkswagon EuroVan.<br><br>
