            Several months ago, I discovered the car that fit my needs, emotional and practical, the Lincoln LS8.  It has 4 doors, but I have never had a better sports car.  I have driven many vehicles, but the ride, handling, comfort and sheer magic for the Lincoln is beyond my highest expectations.  It is the car that has functionality, four door sedan, but once behind the wheel and on the road (with 12 speaker Alpine CD audio system), you're in your own world.  You forget that it is a &quot;sedan&quot;

There is one problem.  In parking lots, at the stores or mall, you must enter the LS8 quickly -or- you are converged upon by those inquiring minds that want to know and see more.  Your ego engages, then, you give them a look at the inside and under the hood and praise your luck at choosing this car before Motor Trend declared it the 2000 Car or the Year.

Be cautious of the heated seats (not for cold weather).  They are very, perhaps too, relaxing.
