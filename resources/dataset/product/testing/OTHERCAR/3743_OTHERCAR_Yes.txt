            We've all heard about single vehicle families and never thought we'd consider it, but!  My wife and I decided that after she quit work, I could take the bus, and she would keep a vehicle at home for errands, etc.  (What's wrong with this picture)  So we sold both our cars and bought a 2000 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 extended cab.  Seeing as we live on five acres, the truck serves the dual purpose of people and &quot;stuff&quot; hauler.  What a great all around vehicle!  It is definitely the best riding pickup I've ever driven, the most convenient truck back seat I've ever dealt with and by far the best gas mileage (16-21.5mpg) I've enjoyed from a full size pickup.  Yes, overall I am very pleased.  We bought it with the small 4.8L V-8 but so far even after towing a boat, large U-Haul trailer, and flatbed trailer it doesn't seem to lack for power.  GM's addition of a &quot;tow/haul mode&quot; (rather than just an override for the  overdrive) added to their transmissions seems to work very nicely. The suspension does a good job of soaking up all but the worst bumps, although I am reminded every-so-often that it is still a pickup and not a luxury car.

With a 20 month old baby to lift in and out, even that has been easier to deal with than expected. No twisting and bending over trying to lift 30+ pounds in and out.  It is pretty much a straight, horizontal shot for my wife at 5'4&quot; and myself at 6'3&quot;.  

I will have to say the quality of fabric could be better along with the quality of things such as visors, cheap plastic dash, etc.  Also, although it has a CD player the quality of sound is not up to today's standards.  Maybe they just expect everyone to go out and purchase a $500.00 system to replace the factory unit. Some good quality speakers would go a long way.

But all in all, this is probably the best all around vehicle I have owned and yes, I have owned a lot of makes and models.  Still not perfect but much better than the previous generation Chevrolet.  <br><br>
