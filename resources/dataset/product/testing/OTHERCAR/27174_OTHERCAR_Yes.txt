            I bought the 1998 Passat new.  I had originally gone to the VW dealer to admire the new beetle.  I wasn't planning to buy a VW.  But I was shopping for cars at the time.  And I was actually looking at BMWs.

As soon as I saw the exterior, the overall shape and the finer details, I fell in love.  I took it out for a test drive and my feelings intensified.  It handles like a sports car.  It's quiet.

The design and assembly conform to the highest German standards.  The only bad design IMHO is the rear cupholder.  Mine broke off shortly after I got the car.

I have the 4 cylinder model with 16&quot; alloy wheels, sunroof, mudflaps, and CD player.  The sound system is excellent: 8 speakers, great bass.  And let me just say that I have never seen cooler dashboard lights.  I've actually gotten compliments from people in other cars as they pull up to a light.

Even the 4 cylinder has good pickup.  I have a manual transmission.  I have to admit, sometimes the clutch isn't as responsive as other cars I've driven.

I think the biggest selling point is the price.  In buying this car, you are getting one heck of a deal.  I think it compares to the lower-end BMWs and costs a fraction of the price.  Plus you don't get that stuffy &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; attitude from the sales person.  At least I didn't.  Anyone looking for a great deal on a sporty luxury car that's fun to drive should consider the Passat.

Now, about the two minor problems.  For the past 6 months or so, the cruise control has this annoying &quot;feature&quot; where it shuts off if you try to accelerate using the accelerate control.  It doesn't happen all the time.  But I haven't noticed any kind of identifiable pattern.

The other problem is with the driver door lock.  It doesn't always lock when you use the electric door button or the remote.  The funny thing is that the alarm still gets set when using the remote.  This can lead to some stick situations.  One time, I got in the car and the alarm didn't go off until I turned the key in the ignition.

Both of these problems required .5 hours of labor each to diagnose ($75 at the dealer).  And both were estimated to cost about $200 each to fix.  I'm going to live with the problems for now, rather than pay the $400.

It's possible that they've fixed these problems in the newer models.  Drive the car and make up your own mind.
