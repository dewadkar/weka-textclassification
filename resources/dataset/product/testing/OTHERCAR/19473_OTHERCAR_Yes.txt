            Easy ~ Easy ~ Easy!!  After asking several Auction sellers what was the best &amp; easiest Digital Camera to buy, I was told time &amp; again that the Sony Digitals were the best.  The Sony MVC-FD7 was the newest thing in '98 but it's paid for itself.  I primarily use it to take photo's for Auctions so if the picture blurs, the lighting isn't quite right or I just didn't like the shots ~ erase them &amp; start over.

Using regular 1.44MB discs is real handy because I have boxes of them laying around &amp; it's so nice just to pop the disc out of the camera &amp; into the computer.  Once I edit for size the pictures are ready to go anywhere:  Family, Friends, Auctions, Slide Shows and I even used some when I made up our Business Cards.  If I need a paper copy I just print one out on our color printer and I'm sure a picture quality printer would do better than a regular DeskJet but they come out pretty good as it is.  I can't even remember the last time we had to take a roll of film in to be developed much less ending up with a bunch of pictures that didn't turn out right.

Other than the Extremely Bright Flash what will wash out whatever you're taking a picture of, I can find not fault with the camera.  As for the Flash, I either stick a finger over part of it, or you can tape off some of it to get the lighting right.

I must say that the Sony products I've had over the years have been quite good &amp; this Camera has met my expectations.  <br><br>
