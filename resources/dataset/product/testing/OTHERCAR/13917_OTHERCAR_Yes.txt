            So my mom just bought a new car, this one in fact. I have had the good fortune to have to all to myself over Christmas break when she was with her fiancee's family in TN.

Let me tell you a little about my experience. First off, this car is very smooth riding. The seats, very comfortable. And one this that also makes the ride great, a nice stero system from the manufacturer. The heat and A/C kick in to full almost immediatly too, really nice especially in the cold MN winters let me tell you!

The car gets great gas mileage, in the city it got about 26 mpg, but when mom was picking me up from school in Iowa we were getting in the mid thirties! The bad part about the fuel system, though, is the tank is really small... only about 10 gallons I think... when you drive as much as I do, even with the great gas mileage, it means filling up every two to three days.

The car has needed no service, but let me tell you, I have heard a little about the service plan, and it looks great... the Saturn people could not have been nicer to my mom who is (quite) inexperienced with cars. Service with a smile... ALWAYS.

I think you could do a lot worse than buying this rather inexpensive, reliable car... If I had more cash (I am not going to lie) I would get something else... but this car is a great deal and drives well... better certainly than our old Toyota Corrola.
