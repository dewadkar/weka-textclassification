            First of all, the name says it all, LEXUS. But this car is exactly what you would expect a Lexus to be. It's smooth quiet ride. It has great features. And beautiful styling. The leather is so soft. The seats are very comfortable. The interior is well appointed. I have the Coach Edition with perforated leather which is better for summer weather. It has nice wood trim. The dashboard is nice and bright but not blinding. It has good sound system. For some reason, when I crank up the sound system, the car feels even smoother. The car has good power from the 3.0L 210HP V6. And this isn't the Camry engine, it's a Lexus engine. My father has a 2001 Camry. It's not the same engine. I don't know why people keep comparing the Camry and ES300. They only share the same platform and 25% of the same components. If you buy a well-optioned Camry and think it's the same as an ES300, believe me it's not. I know firsthand. Shell out the few extra bucks cause it's worth it.
