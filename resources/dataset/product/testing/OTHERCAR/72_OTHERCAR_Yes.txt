            I was a prior MB owner (190E) and wanted to buy a larger car for my ever-growing family.  The 2000 model of the E320 is FANTASTIC.  It has so many great features, including FREE maintenance for the first 4 years or 50,000 miles.  The body style is sportier than the previous models. It is a fun car to drive while still offering all the latest in high tech safety features.  The car handles great and is very comfortable on long drives, plenty of room;even in the back for my long legged teenager.  The Bose stereo system is awesome and the teleaid emergency system (like GM's onstar) really makes you feel safe. The new class of mercedes enables you to drive a luxury car that handles great and doesn't make you look like a senior citizen ( no offense !) behind the wheel.  Go out and test drive one today.  I promise you WON'T be disappointed.      <br><br>
