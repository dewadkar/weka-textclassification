                 I had a Dodge 2500 diesel before this truck and it was just too big for normal driving.  I really like the body style of the Dodge truck and all of the changes that they have made to their trucks.  
     The Dakota is a mid size truck and I like how much room there is in it.  The 4X4 gets good fuel mileage and is dependable for various driving conditions.  I love the power of the V-8, but in some cases I feel it has more power than necessary for everyday commuting.  The tires have a tendency to spin upon acceleration, especially on wet pavement.  
     It is very comfortable to drive on and off the road.  It is a very dependable truck.  It satisfies the needs for hauling items or towing recreational vehicles.  I think anyone who owns their own home would be satisfied owning this truck.  However the extra cab might be suitable for small children I find it uncomfortable for adults on long trips.        <br><br>
