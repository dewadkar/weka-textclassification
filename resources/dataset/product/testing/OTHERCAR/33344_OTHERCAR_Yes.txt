            I compared SUV's before I picked the Pathfinder.  They are a TAD bit pricey.  The Pathfinder drives like a car and make you forget about the fact it is a utility vehicle.  The one thing that I noticed is,that you can never get the windows to seal. It is like the wind leaks through .it's annoying. My sister also has one. I drove it the same wind noise were present.  The truck is very light. almost too light for a SUV. I previously owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee, there is no comparison the pathfinder is a better SUV that is a fact. The Pathfinder designers did go after the type of consumer that I am. The person with a family that refuses to own a mini van and wants style in there vehicle this is a sharp vehicle. The powerful engine makes  driving it a joy !!! I  started stating about the wind noise other than that all i have is praise. The SUV has plenty of leg room for all the passengers.  The back seat even reclines making everyone comfortable for those long road trips.  This vehicle definitely has style.  I mentioned briefly about cost, it is in the category with  Grand Cherokee, Four Runner, Explorer, Blazer. I am a vehicle person, I trade vehicles every six months because  I am big on Styling in my vehicle.This is the best SUV in the class. The rest of the above mention cannot live up to the pathfinder. As, for the internet they say you can get a pathfinder around 29,000 that's good advertising. Expect to pay around 32,000. you may be able to get one of those other vehicles cheaper but you get what you pay for. Spend that couple of extra thousand it's worth it. The only suv that outclass this is the Lexus and Mercedes but that's in the big boys dollars.  I have owned and rented every SUV  the pathfinder is the one.<br><br>
