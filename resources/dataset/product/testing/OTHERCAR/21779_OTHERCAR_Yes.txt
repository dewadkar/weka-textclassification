            The Honda Civic isn't the most exciting car in the world. And it doesn't claim to be. What it is, however, is a practical and reliable car that you can depend on. I have a 1997 Civic, and it drives as well at 3 years old as it did when it was new. I've had a couple of close calls with the Civic, and it's come out fine every time. Closest of all was when my next-door neighbor's car burned to the ground right next to my car, not 2 feet away, and there's wasn't the slightest bit of damage. 

I bought the car because I knew that it would last for years. I even bought the extended warranty because I knew I'd have it for at least 100,000 miles. Well, after 3 years I finally had to use the roadside assistance for the first time. The reason? The battery in the alarm remote died and the car couldn't be started. Can't blame Honda for that, it's not even a Honda alarm.

For a car of it's size, the trunk is surprisingly big. Great for hauling groceries or suitcases. And the mileage is through the roof. On a recent trip we averaged almost 36 mpg. 

The ride is a little bumpy at times, but that is to be expected with a smaller car such as this. But it's never let me down, and I plan on keeping it for quite a while. I would recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
