            I first bought a 1998 Integra LS.  3 months later I got rid of it and bought a 1999 GSR.  It was about $4,000 more, but well, well worth it.  If you are in the market for a sporty car under $25,000, I don't believe this one can be beat.  If you are spending this much money on a car, BUY THE GSR!!  Believe me, I have had both and the GSR more than makes up for the price difference.  30 more horsepower without using any more gas?  One of the nice details.  Standard leather and all are nice as well.  The Integra in general is a very nice car, the the first that I have owned that I enjoy driving and will actually go out in it just to drive it, even though I have had it for over a year now.  I think it is the best handling front wheel drive car around.  In the magazine reviews, they seem to slightly complain about it's &quot;dated styling&quot;.  I have had numerous people comment on how nice my car is, and those that know what Integras are always bug me to drive mine since it is a GSR.  Two thumbs up!!<br><br>
