            I have just purchased my 2nd Suburban. My 1st was a 1989 Chevy 1500 Silverado 2WD. I bought it used with 100,000 miles. We put an additional 52,000 miles on this vehicle before we felt it was time to retire her. We know have another used truck. A 1995 GMC SLT 4X4 Suburban. Even though it has 78,000 miles on it, I know I will get plenty of use out of it. Yes, fuel mileage is a dog but that is the only sacrifice, I feel, that you have. Room,durability and safety are far more important factors in our family. I have 4 kids and a dog so room is probably number one for me. I chose a 4X4 this time as the ride &amp; handling a more superior than a 2WD. Living in NC the on demand 4WD comes in quite handy. The power features need attention. Memory on the power seat would be nice. Climate control a definite. Don't buy a Suburban without rear a/c!! You'll never cool it down in the summer.<br><br>
