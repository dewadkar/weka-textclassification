            Well, I have been anticipating getting my license for a while now, and of course with that comes my searching for the car I want. I looked at the VW Jetta, The Toyota Celica, and The Ford Mustang. After figuring out what I could afford I realized how perfect the neon was for me. It is a decent priced car(but we did haggle a lot with the dealer). It was great handling, very comfortable, it has a good amount of power for the type of car it is, and I also went all out with it. I bought the ES model with the sunroof and alloy-wheels, added the 4-disc in dash CD player/cassette player, and cruise control. 

 I never liked the old Neons but when I drove the new one, I fell in love. I know im not an expert(I am a new driver!) but I am very happy with my car. It has everything I wanted in a car and more. It is also very quite and the sound system is wonderful. All around it is a very good car, I love it, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good car that wont empty your wallet, but still give you the luxury feeling.<br><br>
