            My wife and I bought our 1998 Hyundai Tiburon the new-fashioned way:  we ordered it off the internet.  For some reason, Tiburons then and now don't seem very abundant.  We ordered the FX model with a CD player and a sunroof.  

Before buying the Tiburon, we shopped around for a sporty looking car.  We'd narrowed it down to the Tiburon and the Mitsubishi Eclipse.  Both cars handled very similarly.  Since the Hyundai was around $3000 less than the Eclipse, that's what we chose.  

I don't have much good to say about our Tiburon except it's still fun to drive, it gets good gas milage (25-30 mpg,) and people still look at it as we drive by.  Now for the down side.  The problems we've had with our Hyundai are:
-had it in to the shop a couple times for because the &quot;check engine light&quot; kept coming on.  service dept replaced some kind of air valve twice
-the paint around every little ding and around the locks is chipping
-had the vent? to the gas tank replaced twice- gas would splash out of the tank when we tried to fill it
-the gear shift (automatic) has been stuck in park several times- we've had to use the override button to release it.  When we brought it in to have it checked, were told there's nothing wrong with it
-all four tires have gone flat numerous times.  the tires have been checked and are fine- it may be the rims are bad.  Hyundai service dept assures me my rims are fine-it must be the tires.  We carry a portable air compressor in the trunk at all times.  
-the rear windshield leaked when it rained- enough that there would be a puddle in the back seat.  Service dept assured me it wasn't the windshield leaking, but rather was the hose for the windshield washer.  They fixed it.  I stopped looking in my backseat when it rains

I like to drive my Tiburon because its small and easy to handle.  However, I would never recommend to car to anyone- friend or enemy.
