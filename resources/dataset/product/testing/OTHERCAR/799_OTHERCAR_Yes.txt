            I'll first warn you that I am certainly not a car expert, but do enjoy a reliable car with a luxurious feel that is in my price range. Four months ago I traded in my '92 Camry (which I loved dearly). For the next three months I drove my mother's '96 Camry which also was wonderful.  I wanted a new car from the Toyota family, but to a 25 year old recent college grad, I wanted something with a bit more style and sportiness than my parent's Camry.  The Celica just wasn't right for me, so I had no problem choosing the Solara.

Due to a budget, I chose the 4 cylinder. Comparable to the Camry and Accord, the Solara's 4 cylinder is sufficient for my driving.  However, if you really want power and performance, or drive like a few guys I know, pay the extra 1,500-2,000 to get a 6 cylinder.

The interior styling (minus the faux-wood details) is similar to the Camry.  The radio tuner is a little too far to the right, but the abundance of pre-set buttons are handy. The sound is superb (to my surprise).  Heating and cooling work excellently.  The rear defrost is one of the quickest to work that I have ever seen.  

Keyless entry is a blessing for me.  The folks at Toyota can have my thanks for installing the interior light to come on when the &quot;unlock&quot; function is hit.  Upon locking doors, or turning on ignition, the light will turn off.

This is the first two door car I have owned. I'm not too pleased with access to the back seat. Fortunately, I rarely use it. Some have complained about the high trunk, but even being short, I have no problem accessing it.

Overall, I love my Solara.  The styling is unique in my opinion, and I couldn't be happier with it. The only drawback I have is the fact that i wish I had opted for a 6 cylinder.<br><br>
