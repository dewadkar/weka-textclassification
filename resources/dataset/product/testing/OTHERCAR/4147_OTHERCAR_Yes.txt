            I think I jumped into the SUV Craze just before it started.  
Isuzu Rodeo.  Its ruggedness and nice look sold me, so instead of buying the Maxima, I bought slightly more expensive Isuzu.  

There are two company that are very alike in this automobile industry I think.  Those two will be Subaru and Isuzu.  Why?  They are making very good cars, but with very minimalistic approach.  They never equip a car with luxury, but essentials.  

Goods

1. Engine
V6.  If you are looking for a car 1995 SUV market, then Isuzu is a great choice.  It has very lively V6.  It's not as sophisticated as a competitive let's say Toyota 4Runner V6, but it responds at your will even a bit jerky at sometimes.  So, power is never an issue with Isuzu Rodeo unless you are thinking about 4 Cylinder which I know nothing about.  If you need even more or passing power, there is a power button that add some kicks.  

2. Versatility.
I am sure every car in this SUV market probably falls into this category.  But when it comes to money to Space ratio, Rodeo is a great choice.  For the money around $19000, it provide more or equal usable space than any other SUVs.  

I went to ski with this car and carried full load of people.  I went everywhere with it.  When I had to go to furniture shopping, I didn't have to worry about renting a truck.  I can fit almost everything inside.  

3. Roominess
This Rodel has really high ceiling.  If you are 7 footer, I think you can sit comfortably.  I never owned Jeep Grand Cherokee, but I hated its small interior space and small cargo space.  In the back seat, you have plenty of leg rooms even if you push the front chair all the way back.  

4. Spare tire
I think this car was one of the earliest SUV offered external spare tire storage.  It's very convenient to have a spare right in the back of the car.  The main I liked this is its look.  It just add more rugged image to the whole car.  I have seen this car without the spare in the back.  It looked awful.  It looked like it was missing something.  

5. High Ride /  Comfortable Chair
People love SUV because of its commending view.  This car is no exception.  The Dash board in this car doesn't take much space and they are placed pretty well belowed the eye level, so the view is really crear.  Even the hood is flat.  

Chair is not plush,but it's well padded.  I drove this car from Maryland to Vermont without any back pain.

Bad

1. Ride
You can think of this car as a truck.  That's more precise.  The shock is good quality, but the car is a bit on a heavy side, not overwhelming.  Ride is I think more like average.  Since all SUV has high center gravity, you cannot drive the car like regular sedan.  However, I knew that this problem changed.  Ride was greatly improved in later models.  My friend bought same Isuzu in 1997, and it had more car like ride and cabin noise was reduced quite a bit.  

2. Too simple sometimes
This car is never luxury.  It changed now, but at least then, it wasn't.  For the money, you could have bought a sedan with a lot more features, so you sometimes miss the luxury amenities or simple things like cup holders.  

3. 4 X 4
This car doesn't have on demand 4x4.  I think later model has added this, but 95 model didn't have it.  You have to stop the car to engage the 4 X 4.  It worked beautifully, but I didn't like the fact that I had to stop.     

4. safety.
No Air Bag/ No ABS.  

I had this car about 5 years.  Every 2 weeks, I cleaned it and waxed it.  It's a very very nice car.  It drives well, carries tons of stuffs, and no major breakdowns unless you cause it.  I really want to recommend this car, but at the same, I am a bit hesitant.  In the rain or in snow, this car is terrible.  Most SUV manufacturer shows SUV going through jungles or snow mountain, but when driving on a wet road or snowing road, this car is not that good.  Back wheels are the problem.  You can oversteer so easily.  If this car had ABS or Traction control, then it would have solved a lot of problems, but it doesn't.  So, you have to drive carefully in bad weather like any other cars.  

So, what do I think about the car?  Half and half.  It's good and bad at the same time.  <br><br>
