            Ever since I bought my 1997 Prelude last December I have enjoyed every minute of it!  From its sleek styling, to good gas mileage, to its excellent acceleration, I don't think I could have made a better buy!
The Prelude is the only car in the Acura/Honda family that has a V-tech engine set up for performance rather than gas mileage with the exception of the Acura NSX which is priced in the $80's range!  The ride and shifting are very smooth, and you must indeed get the 5 speed!  You will quickly learn the power of this 4 cyl when you beat Camaros and Mustags at the traffic lights.  The styling is a bit different but is comparable to the new headlights on the 2000 Celica.  This car is for someone who wants to enjoy their daily commute to work, and can't wait to go home just because of the drive!  Some bonuses are a good amount of trunk space, awesome sound system and high resale value.  A car has to be pretty special to have a web site, www.hondaprelude.com, devoted to its enthusiasts!  This car is 3 years old and needed no maintenance excluding oil changes.  It runs the same as when I picked it up from the dealer. This is an excellent sports car for the price causing me to definately plan on purchasing the next model.<br><br>
