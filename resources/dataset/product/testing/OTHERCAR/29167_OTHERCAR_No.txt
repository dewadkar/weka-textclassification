            I bought the car in 1995 with 34,000 miles on it from my sister.  It was my very first car and I have regretted buying it since day one.  This car is unbelievable.  It is not even close to being reliable since I had to replace the original exhaust system, replace the replacement, and again replace the tailpipe and muffler.  I also needed a new transmission along with many other necessities.  The car sounds like it is ready to fall apart when it is on the road.  When it hits a bump in the road (especially railroad tracks) I have to cringe because it sounds like it is ready to fall apart.  I felt like I bought a new car, just piece by piece.  I would not recommend this car at all.<br><br>
