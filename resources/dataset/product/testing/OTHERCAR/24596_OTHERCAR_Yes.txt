            We bought a 1994 Tercel about two years ago, when we were desperately seeking a small, affordable, reliable car.  Toyota's excellent track record for reliability and repairs was another factor in our decision to buy.  It has not been a disappointment.  Although the Tercel is pretty much a bare-bones car, the craftsmanship is first-rate and mechanical problems are few and far between.  

Believe it or not, the Tercel is actually fun to drive.  The steering is tight, and it handles wonderfully.  For such a small 4-cylinder engine, it is a real powerhouse.  Braving the wilds of rush-hour Interstate traffic is no problem in the Tercel.  Our particular model has a manual four-speed transmission, and the engine really revs up, but it can cruise along just fine at 85 mph!  A fifth gear would be a welcome addition, but the car does fine without it.  It also gets great gas mileage-- about 35 mpg on average.  

We haven't had a spot of trouble with the Tercel. The woman who owned it previously had bought it new, and she never had any problems with it, either.  The only thing we've had to fix was the starter, a relatively cheap and easy repair. (We understand the starter to be a common problem in mid-90's Toyotas.)  There is no rust on the car, even though it spent most of its years in a climate where salty roads are common in wintertime.

The Tercel drives well in all kinds of conditions-- gravel roads, dirt roads, snow and ice, high-speed traffic-- it's happy to go wherever the driver wants it to.  The shocks and suspension are pretty good, and make for a relatively comfy, even ride.  It's mostly quiet, except when the engine is revving on the Interstate.  Occasionally the windows do not shut properly, and require some adjustment.  There are no mysterious squeaks or rattles at all.  

The seats and ceiling of the car are upholstered in grey vinyl.  Surprisingly, the interior has held up very well over the years, showing few signs of wear and tear.  The dashboard and carpeting show no signs of fading in the sunlight.  Of course there are a few tears in the upholstery on the seats, but no major gashes.  The seats themselves are very comfy, although there is not much passenger room in the backseat.  

The glove box is roomy and easily reached from the driver's side, although the locking mechanism is prone to freeze up once in a while.  Sometimes it needs to be slammed several times before it will close again. Relative to the car's size, the trunk is huge, but you have to unlock it every time you want to open it. The gas cap is also equipped with a lock.  This has proven to be a problem on more than one winter day when the lock is frozen and the tank is on &quot;E&quot;. 

A major annoyance is that there are no cup holders, and you can't set anything on the dash and expect it to stay there.  That means that drinks have to be wedged between the emergency brake and the seat.  Another annoyance is the positioning of the radio.  It is located behind the gearshift and uncomfortably low, requiring some contortion on the part of the driver to adjust the radio controls.  The windshield-washer fluid reservoir seems to be a bit too small-- we're constantly filling it up.

This Tercel is not equipped with air conditioning (a big bummer in the sticky, sweltering Arkansas summertime), but the heater is excellent.  It heats the whole car very nicely within a matter of minutes.  Both front and rear defrost work in minutes, as well.

We definitely recommend the Toyota Tercel to anyone who wants an economical-yet-fun car.  It's not the most beautiful car in the world, but it's solid, reliable, and has wonderful driveability.<br><br>
