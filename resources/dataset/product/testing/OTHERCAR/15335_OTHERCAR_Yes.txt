            I have to start with an apology because the camera I own is an older, and less expensive one than this Sony Mavica. Mine is a MVC-FD71 and I received it as a gift from my brother for Christmas last year. I find that the skill it takes to snapshots scenes, ones that are patterns, textures, or electronic images for e mail or printing can be edited using sophisticated computer visual editing equipment. 

The thing to do, for me, is to snapshot and take the photograph as a digital image with the thought in mind that the moments count. I have found the Sony Mavica a reliable camera for this purpose. It is lightweight, carries well, is snug, and is available quickly.

The use of a 3.5 floppy for transferring the images to my Illustrator or Photoshop program, and then storing what I choose of the series I am working on is a simple process. These images that I work with give me a sense of an aesthetic experience that snapshot cameras have been able to give me in the past. 

I call this point and shoot photography. The camera I used previously and still use is a Kodak Ektralite 10 Camera with built in flash. 

There are more expensive cameras for my purposes, more expensive than the Kodak Ektralite and certainly more impressive than the delightful, lightweight, and useful Sony Mavica. 

I find it a hardy camera that when I work on my series of snapshots of the homeless, literally going to them right on the street after stopping my car, (the camera is portable) or of a spiritual place (the camera is unobtrusive), or patterns and textures of things (one can study and snapshot), I discover like the longer remarks on this artistic and available exercise that my friends have also snapshot some extraordinary pictures.

The flash unit works well, the auto focus is excellent, and the zoom feature responds quickly. The battery lasts long enough, and recharging it is a straightforward task reliably accomplished every time I have recharged.

The set up of the readings for setting the Sony Mavica FD71 is probably akin to the very same camera on this page, and yes I would move up. I am able to review the images, though I find that I must work with the actual image later since the representation in the viewfinder is not literally as I see them in my photo editing equipment. This is good because I have a baseline with which to work, and the capture in the snapshot mode makes for a quick review of what is on the disk. 

This allows me time to think about the image and the statements that represent intimate or interesting representations, sometimes of an abstract kind. I photograph store fronts, shop windows, take reflections, places and mostly editorial statements.

And do some lovely portrait work that is improving because of the snapshot nature of the unintimidating size and purpose that the camera provides. 

The Sony Mavica is a less intimidating instrument, friendly to both the user (photographer), and the subject (both person and statement or condition).

Here is something on the art as an artist's statement starting with an example of a snapshot taken by a friend of mine (a color picture), and one I have taken the time to study. This will explain my intent and what the Sony Mavica can bring out as a digital camera.

About This Photo
The remarkable thing about this photo is it illustrates in a starring color of blue what and who is willing to be a part of the scene in front of a Cathedral or Church. There is a silence to the statement that is on the face of this man, an artist, whose picture was taken by a friend and her husband on a tourist trip to London. 

For some reason I have worked with this photo in many forms and wanted to show you the face of this man in Europe who is a modern visage of statement before an old and most imaginative spot. Here is a drama of movement caught in the stillness, and in the closeup of a face. Note that he is blue, not the real color change of some digital transformation but the makeup that he wears along with an all blue robe and costuming that seems to be within the confines of the entryway. 

I find this an inviting and mysterious statement, for we find a magical and wonderous invitation in the Cities of our world, and in these great cities among the religious places of sacred meaning artists come and can by their presence add to the majesty of the humility that is within us all. I think this is a picture worth looking at for a few moments and share it here with you because I was struck by the awe of the humanity the man showed in his performance and waiting before the doors of a great Cathedral, like a guard and friend, like a beggar, and like a pilgrim who welcomes others and says I am among the least of you. I, too, have come here to be bidding my prayers and look for the alms that are saving in the righteous. Come and be welcomed to a millennium of the spirit with this invitation that is silent, and quiet yet speaks with sincerity. So I found About This Photo. 


My Photography Tips &amp; Tricks
When taking a photograph I look for texture, and I enjoy color. I find that there is a camera in each of us that sees things. We are able to catch moments with the flick of an eyelid. 

There is a grand scene of both a simple, and also a telling kind by looking at others in light of the memory of our own mortality. This kind of bidding into the light of the day, and seeing the beauty of the seasons in the people is a gift that is practical for we do not need a camera to catch these photographs of memory and moment. 

To have a camera, though, even a digital one that is a little trickier to use than a snapshot kind of picture picture picture and click click flash kind is also another kind of exercise in the use of vision and sight. I am engaged in this learning exercise of finding out how to see, again, the new. To find the motion, and to find the moments that are telling in their pathos, their gentleness, and in their invitation to a larger sense of the world of our living selves in friendship and identity with others in a fresh world that is all so imperfect. 


My Favorite Subjects
Architecture. The way that a building sits within and moves along with the landscape, both in the pastoral or in the scene of an approach to a city where the buildings are an edifice of man's wisdom and of his industry to keep his daily bread. 

The common moments of foiliage and pastoral kind of spirit that is a statement allowing us to a window to God, in a cloistered sense of hallowing the moments in memory recollected of people we know and people we do not know. This is a part of the crowd of which we are a part, and of which we are also alone yet among. 

Even the existential moment of pain, and of machine, and of diversion in the sound and consumerism of a blue light special and the ditty of the jingle, or the pressure of the poetry that is a kind of embrace or images that can be brought to mind in a diversity of the uncommon specialness that we enjoy for pleasure to the eye. 

Nature. In the rocks, in the way of the patterns and the craigs, and the hidden that is seen so it is revealed to us in a pleasing revealing of what it is to be alive, even in the sexuality of our breath and in the desire that we hold for the things of beauty and in the life that it represents. For this is the precious representation of the painterly eye that can capture the lights, both in their tones and in their colors. Oh, if I could snap what I see I think that my amateur status would be moved to the kind of gift that I admire in so many photographers who do wonderful work with so many unusual representations that awaken me. 

But you may be, like me, a creature who thrives on the wit of the eye and the humor of the painter, and the capturing the image by the lens that is able to leave the soul on its way along the journey that has been just offered for sharing this time around by an artist. I do admire the painter, and in this modern world, I do, too, admire the photographer in a way that I admire the industry of the sculptor who has wrought something strong. Is there this third dimension of sculpture in the photograph, as there is in the solidity of the sculptured work. 

I think so, for there is a hardness there that is like the century that has passed. Now we enter a new century. What more. I say too much with too many words already. 

These advisements from a wise friend, a psychiatrist regarding the discipline of the experience of using a camera like the digital Sony Mavica, with which I work. So I conclude:

Stay attentive to the others who are with you, and in the presence of who is mastering the work remember to be awake. Continue with the journey and remark in recollection, and a healthy sense of practical hope. This element of the vision allows for providence to enter. It is all right to entertain the holy with analysis, and to share in the analysis one has with others. This is a spiritual discipline. 

The electronic camera allows one to take snapshots quickly, to use a simple camera for choosing a subject, and for spending time with the work on your computer. Sharing the work with friends, using it to print literal photographs in color is now a reality. 

This includes using the images to make prints on real photographic paper at a place like Wolf Camera (mine is in Mill Valley, California), or else printing at Kinko's where some artists and amateurs practice making things for their family and even professionally. The cost of reproduction can get a little pricey, and the quality of the Sony Mavica is still within the range of most current publishing requirements. 

I grant this is not the real professional camera one would see in a magazine pages on the &quot;Just Outta Beta&quot; section of &quot;Wired magazine,&quot; nonetheless I have been happy with my gift for Christmas, the Sony Mavica FD71. A snapshot taker of an electronic companion for bringing along on a daily basis.
