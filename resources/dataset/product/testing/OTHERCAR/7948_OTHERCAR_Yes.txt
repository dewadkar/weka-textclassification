            I had a 1997 Jeep Wrangler for approximately 2 years.  I loved every minute of it until my daughter came along.  I actually kept it for about 6 months after she was born.  I had the carseat in back, on the passenger side and the stroller on the seat next to it.  But that took up the entire back seat.  No room for groceries!  I eventually had to trade up to an Explorer, but anyway back to why I loved my little Jeepster . . .

I had dual tops, both a hard top and a soft top.  When summer came, the hard top came off and stayed in the garage (this takes two strong men to accomplish - don't try it alone).  At the end of summer, the soft top folded down and the hard top went back on.

Wranglers can fit in virtually any left over parking area.  You know that idiot with the huge truck that always takes up a spot-and-a-half in the Wal-Mart parking lot?  No big deal.  I could fit in the half a spot that he left over.

One of the best things about Jeeps is the wave.  Any other Jeep driver will wave at you when you are out driving in your Jeep.  It is so fun.  It's like we all know that we are in a special class of our own.  There is no other type of car owner that does this to my knowledge.
