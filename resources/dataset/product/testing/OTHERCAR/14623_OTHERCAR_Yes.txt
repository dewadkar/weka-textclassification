            Bottom line...I wanted a car which gave me confidence that my family was safe and that was a blast to drive.  Answer: Volvo S70.  I am not a car expert.  I feel like I am being fed a line at dealerships every time I trudge out there to make this big financial commitment.  It is almost like, &quot;hey, just don't screw me too much!&quot;

You get in the Volvo S70, close the door and the sound the door makes when it does close immediately tells you your not in your 82 Ford Escort.  The thing is a machine.  It's a solid tank.  It doesn't drive like one though.  I'll get to that.  Volvo has thought of everything. Talk to a rep who has the detailed knowledge of its safety features and you say to yourself, &quot;why aren't they all built like this?&quot;  Volvo is even smart enough to put the gas tank on the passenger side.  That was, your not standing in the highway should you run out of gas.

This car flies.  It does not take off like a jet.  The pick up is good, but once it starts cruising, its like floating.  Watch the speedometer, you will be going thirty miles an hour faster than you feel.  It handles beautifully.  Great in the snow.  Gadgets galore.  Take the time to learn them, it makes the car more fun.

What is really surprising is that the car is actually the same size/length as the wagon.  The trunk is huge.  The cabin is very roomy.  I only have two criticisms of the car.  1) drink holder is a little flimsy.  2) Radio tends too fade in and out.  Consult the sales guy on this and do not accept the answer that the car knows when it is off-highway and therefore, the volume decreases.

Happy driving.  Be smart.  Buy a car that will maintain it value, its structure, and your family.<br><br>
