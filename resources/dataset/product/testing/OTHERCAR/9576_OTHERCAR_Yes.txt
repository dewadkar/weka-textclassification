            I was a Toyota Tacoma Pre-Runner owner until recently, when I bought a 2001 Black Celica GT-S. What a nice car. Going from the relatively big and cumbersome pickup truck to this is very refreshing. I loved my Tacoma, but I am ready for this Celica. I get great gas mileage, and with 180 horse power, I get great performance too. 
The six speed is setup so that 1-3 are low and short, 1st gear is good to about 24 mph, with the engine up past 6000. Takeoff is exceptional, but you must drop the clutch at 3000+ or the tires will skip allover the place. transition to second is a bit odd, but I'm still getting used to the car. 6th is useless around town, but that is to be expected. Third gear is great for slaloming around slow drivers :) The engine loves RPM's, so it is a bit peaky, but I can work with it, and the gearing is designed to make it manageable.
Damn, it's a nice car. Now back to work so I can pay for it.<br><br>
