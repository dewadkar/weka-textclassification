            Having decided that a digital camera was the way to go, and having a price limit I set out to buy myself something that was affordable, yet of sufficient quality that it wouldn't be obsolete too quickly.

The Fuji Finepix 2800 Zoom digital camera certainly has not disappointed.

Initial impressions were that this camera was nicely ergonomically designed. Unlike other cameras that are "box" shaped, this camera is of a more traditional design. It fits in your hands in such a position that you automatically hold it steady, and are never in danger of covering anything important with your fingers, as I have done with other cameras in the past! The design does however make the camera more difficult to carry in a pocket or a small handbag, but it is light enough not to weigh down a big coat pocket or a bag, or even slung over your shoulder on the strap.


The option of framing your picture through the small electronic viewfinder, or the larger LCD screen is an excellent idea, especially when it is Sunny and the light reflects off the larger LCD screen which is all that is offered on some cameras. Because the small viewfinder is electronic rather than simply a see through "window", it is a case of you see what you get in terms of planning your photo. There is no approximation, if it is framed in the viewfinder, it will be on the print. It also takes up a lot less power than the large LCD which I have found important, because this camera is power hungry, but more of that later.

The options and menus for picture quality, and flash type etc, are fairly intuitive, and you don't need to constantly refer to the manual to change settings. However, you best remember in advance which button is which, as the writing rubbed off the casing fairly quickly!

Viewing the photos you have taken and deleting ones you don't want is quick and easy, and I have NEVER mistakenly deleted the wrong ones it is that simple.

Downloading the photos is also quick and easy, and the quality of the final print is excellent.

I particularly wanted the large zoom facility as a lot of my photos are taken at sports events. The 6X zoom is excellent for catching the action, be it across the pitch, or from the back of the stands. Also, the speed of motion of your subject is never too fast for the camera. The continuous photo option where the camera takes 4 photos in quick succession is particularly useful, and has allowed me to catch the crucial moment or a series of photos showing how the points were scored, even at distance and with events happening at great speed.

So does the camera have any bad points? Well yes a few. As I have said, it is power hungry so I'd certainly recommend 8 rechargeable batteries and a charger (the camera takes 4 batteries at a time so you should always have 4 spare and ready to go!)

The camera also occasionally struggles to autofocus in the dark, and as the viewfinder is what you see is what you get, it is sometimes difficult to get your zoom and framing correct in very low light, though obviously when you take the photo the flash fires and the picture is fine.

These minor gripes are not enough to detract from all the excellent qualities this product displays, especially for the price.
