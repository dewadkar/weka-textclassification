            I am very satisfied with my 99' Acura Integra GS. If you are looking for a nice sports car that is not going to put you too deep into the hole, this car is one to consider. I bought this car because of its beauty and most of all the price. The interior is wonderful. Buying a GS model, the interior is all leather from front to back. It comes with a CD/radio player with great speakers to enhance your choice of music.

I love how the car handles itself, living in Minnesota and with the bad winters; this car hardly ever performs badly in the rough winter streets of MN. My car is a manual transmission which only makes it all that better. 
Why i say its all better, well for one thing you save on gas. Besides that, its fun to drive with a manual transmission, keeps you entertain the whole time if you love to drive like me, last but not least, you get the chance to really feel the power that that little machine can crank out.

What i hate most about this car is the room in the back. It is very small and tight. Not recommended for bigger people. other than that the car is one great machine.

If you want more power, go one model up. Buy the GSR, now you'll feel some real power.

I feel that this car is great for anyone of all ages. Its great for teens strictly for the fact that you can show off to your friends. It also goes great with young adults, makes them look and feel young and with power behind the wheel. As for the older folks, face-it; it makes you look and feel younger so why not buy the car.
