            Recently I had to make what I feel to be a big decision concerning my current vehicle.  It was old and the warranty was due to lapse.  While it was in the shop for repairs I had to opportunity to drive a 2000 Malibu LS and I found it to be comfortable, a little sporty, a bit of luxury and a pleasure to drive.  Well when I brought my vehicle in for service two months later I decided to inquiry about the 2000 Malibu LS.  It had everything that I wanted in a vehicle.  It was a pleasure to drive.  It was very, very quiet and handled like a dream.  I decided this was the vehicle for me.  If you are looking for something sporty with a little luxury, good gas mileage, a smooth ride and comfort then this is the vehicle for you.  I recommended this vehicle to a friend of mine and she is purchasing one as we speak.  It's about time Chevrolet!!!!<br><br>
