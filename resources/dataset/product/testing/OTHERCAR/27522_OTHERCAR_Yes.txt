             I have driven my Jeep Grand Cherokee for 3 1/2 years now, &amp; I must say I love it more every day! I find the ride to be a perfect blend of truck toughness, &amp; car smoothness, you feel in tune with the road below you, hugging turns in a way that only a few years ago, one would not have thought possible in a SUV, or truck. Nimble in the turns, with a sure footed-ness that is born of the weight of the vehicle, &amp; it's low center of gravity, which makes it hunker down, &amp; grip the road much a sports car.
  The supple leather interior is perfect for my &quot;on the go&quot; life style, as spills &amp; stains clean up easily. The form fitting front, 6-way, electric, bucket seats, with lumbar support, are as comfortable on long trips as they are on the way to the soccer field. With cruise control, electric windows, 4 speed automatic transmission, 4 range transfer case, headlight sentinel, pulse programmable wipers,fog lamps, headlight sensing rear view mirrors, lighted sun visor mounted mirrors, it offers many amenities, &amp; creature comforts previously found only on luxury vehicles.
 The split fold down rear seat, offers more room for gear than your standard auto, the tonneau cover thwarts prying eyes. My choice of the 195 hp in line 6 cylinder, offers ample power, without guzzling gas, (actual mileage 15 mpg city, 22 highway) not bad for a SUV, &amp; much better than the offered v-8's, the smaller of which does not offer that much more power.Best of all, may be the feeling of safety, in knowing you are driving a heavy vehicle with ample bumpers, &amp; high enough above average traffic, to get a better view of conditions ahead.
 Of the few criticisms, I dislike the offered temporary spare &amp; it's inside, space hogging location. And handling in tight turns is notchey &amp; stiff, at slow speeds, as in parking, both of these problems have corrected in the '99 &amp; up models though.
 All in all I am very satisfied, &amp; being in the car repair business, I do have daily occasions, to drive many different cars, trucks, &amp; SUV's for a comparison.<br><br>
