            In a relentless pursuit to find my husband a carpool car that could also pass for a second family car we stumbled upon an Intrepid.  

We search for vehicles that got good or reasonable gas mileage that could sit six people with belts for each.  Intrepid was one of the few cars that could offer this.

We purchased this car when it had 135,000 miles on it.  This was a leap of faith.  How stupid could someone be to buy a car with that many miles on it when it was only 4 years old.

This was the best purchase we have made.  We have not had one problem with this car.  The only major thing that has needed to be fixed is the pump for the air conditioner.  We have owned it for about 3 years and it has 175,000 miles on it and it is still kicking.

I really like the leg room in it.  My husband and I both have long legs.  Even the back seat is comfortable to sit in.  The car, I think, is a good looking car and very stylish.  Ours came with tinted windows, air, cassette, power windows, power locks and an excellent heater. (Needed for our bad winters)

This may be one of those exceptions to the rule, but it has been a great car.  We paid $3,900 for it which was a real deal, but it has been well worth the money.<br><br>
