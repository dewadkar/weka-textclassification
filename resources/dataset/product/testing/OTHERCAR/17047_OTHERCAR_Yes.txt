            I owned my 98 Durango SLT for about 8 months now. I bought it used with 40,000 miles. I have not had any problems with it so far. We now have 54,000 miles on it and we love every gas sucking one of them!
  We live in the Seattle area and do a lot of traveling into the mountains during the winter and summer and the truck handled excellentlly in all the weather this area has to offer. 
   I have almost all the options and the mid line 5.2 liter engine ( I did this to help save gas. HAH!) The 4 wheel drives handles great on the icy mountain passes and the back roads of the Cascade and Olympic Mountains. Its great to be the first vehicle driving on a mountain logging road in a foot and a half of fresh snow about 30 miles from anywhere and totally plowing through the snow like it was not even there! and doing this with two toddlers in the third seat and my 10 yr old in the center seat. Thats confidence!
  Unfortunatly my wife and I drive 12 miles to work each way in Seattle traffic (about a half hours distance in the carpool lanes), Although the ride is pleasant (especially with a DVD Video installed for all my rear kiddie passengers), The gas mileage suffers badly, we get about 12 mpg on average, but if you read any other reviews thats no secret!
   The 4 wheel antilock brakes work great(and often) on our slick hills, the rear air is a must with the rear passengers (Yes even in Seattle) and the cargo space is superb with all the rear seats folded down, You can easily fit a twin size mattress with room to spare!
   I got rear ended by a 67 pontiac Valiant at about 10 mph, now the Valiant is a big heavy car of solid steel, He needed a new bumper and lights and grill. I got a small crack on the underside of my rear bumper and some minor scraping with no internal damage. I was impressed, as well as the driver of the Valiant!
One other drawback is that the Durango is black, While it looks great...The paint scratches easily and often, SO I would avoid automatic car washes or go on a frequent detailer plan or something.
Barring the gas mileage I have no reservations about recommending this vehicle to anyone.
