            Even though my family is only comprised of three people, I felt the appeal of a station wagon to be undeniable. The cargo room of a truck, with the ease and comfort of a car. Coupled with my entirely positive experience of Subaru's and its being the most attractive of its kind, it wasn't too difficult to make my choice.
While we lingered briefly on the idea of upgrading to an Outback, for all indications that we could see, the only difference was the available options package and the price. Side by side these vehicles seem to have little difference in the way of actual ruggedness. The ground clearance differs by a negligible amount, and other than the nifty buff-colored paint on the lower body panels, there is virtually no difference in the exterior.
The same is true for the engine and that famous all wheel drive that makes Subaru's so appealing. The exact same engine that purrs in my Brighton Legacy purrs in the Outback Limited. The same all wheel drive that Outback owners enjoy is available to me. The main appreciable differences seem to lie in the options package available in the various models. Leather, headrests in the back, and I imagine power door locks.
Even in our &quot;stripped&quot; model we have the comforts of power windows, AC, and a decent stereo. Rather than financing many more thousands of dollars, I lock my doors manually.
The ride is very much standard Subaru. Tight and stuck to the road, but not what you are looking for if you prefer the &quot;recliner that drives&quot; feel that can come with some of the other vehicles in this price range.
I would highly recommend this trim level to anyone looking for a reliable and functional car with many extras that are not in evidence in other more base model cars. The Outback just seems to offer only a bit more comfort for a quite steep increase in price. So steep that is it were a hill, even the beauty of all wheel drive might slip.
