            Hi Folks,
I had been debating whether to buy the 2001 RAV or the CR-V since the past few months and I ended up buying the 2001 CR-V EX (Clover Green)a couple of days back purely because, the 2001 RAVs currently available do not come with the ABS (well, at least, I never saw one although sightings were reported in the RAV4 forums), although it has been listed as an option.
Phullleeeze, car that costs you close to 24 K has OPTIONAL ABS? And you don't even have the option of buying one with the OPTIONAL ABS?!? And to make matters worse, the dealers want MSRP for that?!? Face it Toyota, it takes more than a redesign to regain the #1 position in the cute-ute segment. Even a die-hard toyota fanatic LIKE ME gets forced to shop elsewhere because of the afore-mentioned reasons.
PROS:
It runs like a charm and I was surprised to find that It has a BETTER PICK UP than my 2000 Camry V4 that has a 2.2 liter engine and is definitely lighter than this nifty little sport-ute!!
What floored me was the way it steers!! It cuts like a 1991 Tercel that I just sold off and doesn't feel one bit like handling a truck.. 
It also gives you the added advantage of sitting high above most other drivers on the road.
Dealership Experience: 
Bought it at Open Road Honda in Edison, NJ and the sales rep Sammy (M)is unarguably the best person in the history of car dealerships that I've ever come across. He was being a perfect gentleman, never crowding me once during the whole experience. I went shopping for a 2001 special edition and got a great price in 10 minutes, believe it or not...
 They didn't have one coming in until the next day and he offered to make the same deal on the 2001 EX (exactly the same as 2000, costs 192$ extra, comes with standard floor mats) and I had no clue about it's invoice pricing. Now here's the best part, He even let me use the dealership's computer and Internet to get the pricing from the web.....
I paid a total of 600$ over the invoice price (480$  above invoice for the car and $120 over the standard DMV fees for their paper processing..)
He also sold me a hard cover for $115 which costs $95 plus shipping and handling from the web.
Overall, It was a very good car buying experience, buying a CR-V AND buying from a decent person.
CON(S):
I have 200 miles on it and so far, the only qualm is that it's a lot noisier than my Camry. I am yet to find out how bad the noise levels are at speeds over 75 MPH (may be after I'm done 1K). 

Like I said earlier, the pick up is really good for a 2.0 liter 4-banger. It helps you ease into the highway traffic in a reasonable amount of time - nice and easy - without the tach. hitting 3000+. For those looking to buy a get away car that would do 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds, I'm sorry folks, this is not your vehicle..
This vehicle would be an Ideal choice for you if:
1)You are the kind of person that sticks to the speed limit and do maybe 8 miles or so more during rush hour to move with the flow with no apparent plans for accumulating points for overspeeding...
2)You are the kind of person that has to put up with more than 1 1/2 feet of snow during your winter months and
3) Your family size does not exceed 5 and you are looking to buy a peppy zippy people hauler
I am not qualified to comment on the off-road prowess of this vehicle since I've never done any off-roading all my life before - Nor do I intend taking my CR-V off roads.
