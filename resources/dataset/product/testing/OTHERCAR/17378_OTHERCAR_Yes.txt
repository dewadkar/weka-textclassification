            I recently purchased my first car, and decided on a 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT Spyder Convertible. So far (3 months), my experience with this car has been pretty good. First off, I don't know all that much about cars (and I'm not going to pretend I do), but I am an average (somewhat picky) consumer who test drove many, many cars before deciding on this one. 

<b>Positive Aspects</b>
1. <b>Its a really cute car.</b> If you are looking for a stylish, sleek convertible, this is the right car to look at. I was set on getting a convertible and I looked at every possible model in my price range. This car was by far the best looking one out there...in comparison to the Toyota Celica convertible, the Ford Mustang convertible, and a couple others. It has a great design, and people are often commenting on how much they like my car; it gets a lot of second glances; and people are always very surprised that I only paid $17,000 for it.

2.<b>Lots of get-up-and-go.</b> If you are looking for more then a stylish car, then this is also the car for you. Like I said, I don't know all that much about cars, but in my opinion, this car is pretty turbocharged. I happen to be a speed freak when it comes to freeway driving, and this car handles perfectly at high speeds. Acceleration time is also quick. Its perfect for any speed junkies out there. 

3.<b>Very economical.</b> Not only is this car sleek and sporty, its also not all that expensive. I paid $17,000 for this one-year old car. It has cloth interior, a automatic drop top, with a real glass back window. I believe they come in luxury models, with leather seats, but I did not opt for that version since you have to pay extra to get the leather treated (since its a convertible). The standard GT version is fully equipped at a reasonable price. 

This car also gets great gas mileage. My previous car (a Honda Accord) got 30-40 miles per gallon and I thought that would be very tough to beat. But this car meets that easily. I commute 60 miles a day, and only spend about $40 per week on gas. 

<b>Negative Aspects</b>

1. <b>Not very roomy.</b> This car does not have very much space--no headroom, very little trunk space and a tiny back seat. It is very difficult for taller people to drive this car. My boyfriend is 6 feet tall and cannot drive it at all without hitting his head on the top. So, unfortunately, this car is best for shorter people. The trunk is VERY small. You cannot fit more than one piece of luggage in the back...so travelling in this car is pretty uncomfortable. The backseat is also pretty non-existent. One person can sit back there, but only if they scrunch up into a ball.

2. <b>Bad stock stereo system.</b> The stereo system that came with the car was not good. I had to go out and buy a whole new system on top of the price of the car. Check it out before you decide to buy.

3. <b>Rides too low.</b> I'm always scraping the nose of my car on the street when I go over bumps. I have already scraped off most of the paint around the front end. It could be a problem when I go to sell it...It doesn't ride well over dips and bumps in the road.

SO,
I would say that the positive aspects really outweigh the negative ones. I really enjoy this car. Since I commute, I am in my car for about 2 hours a day. Its really nice to get in the car after work, put down the top, turn on some tunes and feel the wind in my hair all the home. Definately test drive one of these if you are looking for an affordable convertible!
