            I just recently purchased a 2000 Civic Honda 2 door and I don't know why I ever drove anything else. The options included in my EX were great for the price and it drives great. I chose the Civic because I needed a small compact commuter car that didn't look like a death trap. I wanted to feel safe but I didn't have the money for a larger luxury car. 
The best part about the car was the deal I got. I went to SF Honda in the city and got a great price for the car and was able to qualify for the Honda finance special. Not only was the car a deal but the no hassle/ no haggle approach to car sales made me feel empowered. No one asked me about extra features or attempted to convince me to get any extended warranties. I checked out the website and came armed with pages of information regarding the dealer.  Great service and free floor mats.
I haven't had any problems (except the schumck who dinged my car on the first day). I don't forsee any problems because of the good name Honda has. This car is great for someone young starting out. I am very happy with my purchase. I didn't pay too much AND I am driving a car that looks and feels great.<br><br>
