            My school got this camera due when they sent me to a conference that Casio gave to promote the product in an educational environment.  The conference was a couple of hundred dollars and the camera was free for attending (yeah, right).

The camera is easy to learn to use, the point-and-shoot features are helpful to a novice user.  It has other modes that allow the user to do other things with this camera besides take snapshots.  A macro feature, portraiture, 30-second movie (no sound) capability, and other features are easily accessible by rotating a knob on the top of the camera.  This camera is great for pictures to be published to the web and the software that comes with it is easy and adequate.

If you plan to print the pictures, this camera is woefully inadequate.  Picture resolution is great when you are putting it on a screen, but on the LOW LOW LOW end of printability.  I attempted to make prints that were 8x10 and could not due to the graininess of the pixelation.  Maybe if I wanted to crank the image down to 4x5 it would have been ok, but anyone who plans on using it for good photo reproductions should look elsewhere.

Worth the price - when its free, anything is good.  Would I buy it knowing what it can and can't do - NO.  There are a ton of digital cameras out there that can out perform this one and I would not buy it if I had the opportunity.
