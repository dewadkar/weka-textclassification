            I purchased a 1992 Saturn SL2 because I bought into the Saturn vision of a new design.  Having worked in the automotive industry as a mechanical design engineer, I understood the technical challenges of designing a new car, new factory, new dealer network and new workforce at the same time.  Unfortunately, Saturn did not hit the mark on all fronts.  I expect some rattles and shakes from a car in this class, and the Saturn met my expectations.  Lots of plastic means lots of noise when the temperature gets hot or cold.  Performance is reasonable and the car is fun to drive.  The plastic door panels performed as advertised - a man driving a full-sized van backed into the Saturn, hitting the rear door.  When he pulled the van forward, the door popped out into its original shape.  The van driver was hysterical as he was expecting to see a mangled door, not a working one.  Routine maintenance is easy, but not perfect.  Reaching the oil filter requires a good degree of body contorting.  Controls are readable and relevant - no overabundance of idiot lights.  

Mechanical performance and reliability is a little different.  1992 Saturns suffer from an oil consumption disease, drinking one or more quarts every 3000 miles.  At 90,000 miles, every major system had major problems.  The car routinely spouted out a cloud of thick, black smoke under heavy acceleration.  Electrical controls for the windows and door locks became corroded and stopped working, requiring me to pull out each of the contacts and clean them.  The entire exhaust system failed at 90K, and the repair bill ran over $600.  

Some of you may question my maintenance habits, but I assure you that I follow the books when it comes to car maintenance.  Mechanical engineering school gave me an appreciation for the harsh environment inside an engine, so I use the best and keep things clean.  As such, I expected more from my Saturn.  I sold it with 100K miles and bought a used Toyota Corolla.  The Toyota has more miles, runs better, gets better mileage and has demanded less money than my Saturn ever did.
