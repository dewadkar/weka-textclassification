            Chevrolet Trailblazer LS, 2003

Look Out Explorer!

For years the folks at Chevrolet have been trying to make an impact on the midsize SUV market. The Chevrolet division has been chasing the Ford Explorer hoping that some day they will be able to put out a vehicle that could compete with it. 

After 40 months of designing, testing and manufacturing the 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer was born and on the showroom floor of Chevrolet&#146s dealerships across America.

One year old now, let see how the 2003 Trailblazer is doing?

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The 2003 Trailblazer is offered to consumers in three different trims. The base model is the LT, then follows the well equipped LS model and the top  and the top of the lineup is the LTZ. 

All three models are powered by a  4.2-liter, inline 6-cylinder engine and offered in either with 2 wheel-drive or 4 wheel-drive.        

The Chevrolet Trailblazer 4-wheel drive has a curb weight of 428 pounds and a wheelbase of 113 inches. It measures  191.8 inches in length, 74.7 inches in width and 71.9 inches in height. 

The 2003 Trailblazer is powered by a 4.2 liter, inline  six cylinder engine with a cast aluminum block and cylinder head and for transmission your choice is limited to a 4 speed automatic tranny with overdrive.

The Chevrolet Trailblazer I drove was a LS model, so the remainder of this review will concentrate on the LS trim. 


THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The Chevrolet Trailblazer I drove had the same interior color as my previous Explorer, as a matter of fact both interior of the cabins are very similar. The LS and LT trims have fabric interior, while the LTZ model is offered in a very refined leather.

The front seats in the Trailblazer are very comfortable, I took place behind the steering  wheel and after adjusting the seat and mirrors I looked around. 

The front and side view from the Trailblazer is excellent, as for the rear vision it can be difficult until you get use to this type of vehicle. Again from the driver&#146s position all the gauges are very easy to read and all the control buttons are within reach of the driver.

The Trailblazer I drove had an excellent selection of standard luxury features. Air conditioning, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, AM/FM radio, CD player, rear window defroster, luggage rack and alloy wheels.

The SUV also was equipped with the following optional features: The OnStar navigation system which include, GPS navigation,  remote unlocking in case you locked yourself out,  hands free cell phone and one year free service for crash and theft reporting.   

As a whole the interior of the trailblazer is excellent, you will have lots of room, in front and back. The lighting system is superior to the average SUV and storage spaces are every where.

The exterior:

The exterior body of the Trailblazer is a little boxy in appearance, but it does keep true to the Chevy truck lines. 

I do like the slight touch of chrome in the front and also the selection of alloy wheels which gives the Trailblazer a rugged a appearance. 

The cargo volume in the Trailblazer is 41 cubic feet with the rear seat in a up position and this almost doubles to 80.1 cubic feet with the seats down.

The standard towing capacity of this vehicle is set at 6200 ponds.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The Chevrolet Trailblazer LS 2003 is an excellent SUV, it is equipped with a very good list of standard comfort features and with a complete list of standard safety features.
