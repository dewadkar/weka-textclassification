            After admiring myself in the mirror for hours on end, I walked outside to gaze in complete awe at the beautiful 1996 Chevrolet Blazer perched mercilessly in my driveway.  It�s bright red paint glistening in the sunshine (kind of like my hair J).  I pat myself on the back for choosing such a fabulous vehicle, and luxurious four-door SUV.   I watch neighbors as they weep in sorrow for not having such a beautiful truck.

Suddenly I awake to realize my hair isn�t as cool as I thought it was, and the vehicle in my driveway is nothing close to a 1996 Red, four-door Chevrolet Blazer.  Bummer.   

This review is only one of the many participating in the <b>Gender-Bender Write-Off</b>.  In other words, we are taking subjects generally written by the opposite genders, and turning the tables.  Other trans-writers include: amykhar, bluehawq, ChrisJarmick, conradd, gracef, janesbit, KaraHoo, KateTPZ, KristenNC, MsBayLady, netKat, njymix, prepoia, slick4591, soxfan, tipu, T.Rob, taurusmoon, thinkerlady, white_hat, wivabef and zoey123. <i> Don�t forget to take a look at their reviews!</i>

Honestly, I am not a man, but since I am portraying a man�s point-of-view on this subject, I will do the best I can. 

With it�s limited slip differential torque capacity of 2500 cubic tons together with 55 horses under the hood (is that good?) this baby will do 0-60 in 3.9 minutes while towing a 72-foot yacht.  Obviously, I know nothing about the technicalities of this vehicle (as a �man� would), but I honestly tried! Basically, if you are seeking a mechanic�s review, look elsewhere, but if you are looking for what�s <b>really</b> important in this vehicle, you�ve come to the right review.  So, here is the stuff I <b>do</b> know about�

As we round the 21st century, our families� 1996 Chevy Blazer still glistens and shines like a newborn.  With its cherry red exterior and gray leather interior, it looks rather superb considering the number of years we�ve had her.  Not to mention, taking yearly 12-hour (one way) trips to Philadelphia, PA.  The drastic change in climate didn�t seem to faze her a bit.  With regular check-ups, she�s aged beautifully.  

The current estimated price for a 1996 Chevy Blazer is roughly $9500 - $16500.  My opinion? It�s certainly worth this price.  Of course, if you have the extra dough, you might want to grab a newer version.

The interior is excellently proportioned.  Its sleek dash allows more legroom.  An overhead console provides the current outside temperature, an easy to reach compartment for your garage-door opener (you don�t even have to take it out of the console to open the garage-door!), a small slot for your sunglasses, and a miscellaneous compartment.  Not to mention the large glove compartment and hidden console underneath the armrest.  Also, if you find it difficult to hold a drink and drive at the same time, Chevy has made your life a bit easier by providing two cup holders (two sizes in one).  Our Chevy has a CD player, which makes it easier for you to keep up with the times.   

Truck smuck.  The Chevy Blazer makes it easy to travel with large objects in two convenient ways.  1. The hatchback.  No bulky tires in the way of the rear, and easy open/close hatchback instead.  2.  Fold down backseats.  The two backseats fold down to make room for transporting larger objects.  You won�t need to borrow your best-friend�s truck anymore.   The backseats also have both �adult� and �child� seatbelts.  Your children can ride in style and safety!

<b>What about those curves?! (I knew you guys were going to ask!)</b>

I was only allowed to actually drive this vehicle for a short time, but my experiences have been nothing out of the ordinary.  Of course, you won't get the tight curves with an SUV as you will with a car, but I have found Chevy blazer to be more comfortable and reliable around curves versus trucks and other SUVs.  Smooth braking allows for relaxed turns as well as stopping at red lights, even if those annoying stops are sudden.  As a young driver (at the time), I had a lot of those unexpected and abrupt stops, but I learned quickly that slamming on the brakes wasn't the best idea.  Fortunately, this vehicle allows you to slam on the brakes and still have a smooth stop (when time and circumstance are forgiving, that is). 

Maintenance?  My parents would take her to the shop maybe twice a year, but besides the one or two small accidents, she never gave us problems.  (Not to mention, her performance was expected to slack after the grueling episodes my brother put her through while learning to drive.)

Basically, I <b>always</b> felt safe while traveling in our blazer.  And since my parents were police officers, she was the only vehicle (besides cruisers) our family had, therefore, we drove her everywhere and back.  

Overall, safety, comfort ability, easy travel arrangements, smooth riding, and incredible reliability makes this vehicle a great choice for a family.  Men, check out auto weekly for the other stuff :o)
