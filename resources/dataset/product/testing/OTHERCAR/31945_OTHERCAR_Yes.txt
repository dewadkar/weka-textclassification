            I came into this car 5,000 miles ago, and have been totally impressed for the most part. However, the car does have it's quirks that I find a bit bothersome, but it's literally nothing when compared to the performance this car has given me thus far. So which do you want people? The good or the bad first? Well, someone just shouted from the back, and they want to know what sucks about it. 

First of all, the cup holder is ingenious. It's placement, however, is not. If you get a chance to look at the interior for this car, put a 20oz bottle in the cup holder and take a good long look at your stereo. You'll notice that it doesn't exist. Half of the radio disappears when the cup holder drops. A small quirk, yes, but you'd think that years of German research could have resulted in dropping the cup holder below the stereo and climate controls. A simple solution would be widening the bottom of the console, so drinks will fit, and will not interfere with shifting. Doing such would also keep the radio in eyes range. I tend to switch cds out a lot, and even with the changer in the trunk, I fiddle with the radio quite a bit. This, to be honest, is my biggest complaint. 

Second on the list, would be the vents in the dash. Don't get me wrong, they look really good when closed, but I'd prefer a simple on/off slider as opposed to readjusting the direction of the air when I get in the car. It's a miniscule detail that does mean something. If you don't know what the jetta's vents look like, think of a set of blinds. It's a great look, but it's a minor burden on your back. 

Third; cold starts. I've never had a major problem with this, but I did have a few minor troubles, maybe 2 times at best. I was delayed about 5 minutes one time, and a minute the other time. I understand that it's a diesel, and I know that diesels have problems in the cold, so this is really a given. However, the amount of problems you'll encounter are nothing compared to the diesels of yesteryear. If I had to fiddle with an 83 VW rabbit diesel in the winter mornings, I'd beg for a car like this. 

Fourth, leg room and storage. It's a small sedan, not a passat. If you're buying this car, you know this, so you should expect this. My only troubles are with the trunk. In fact, most of my troubles are with trunks in general. It gets difficult to fit average size boxes in there. It's possible, but it's a task. The fold down seats help out a lot, but unless you're only moving skis or short pieces of wood, it doesn't help much. I'd be ecstatic if the glass moved up with the trunk and allowed you to fit stuff in with a bit more ease. Almost like a mock-hatch, if you will. My golf was a smaller car, but I could fit a small fridge in it simply because of the hatch. 

Those were all personal problems I have as a result of everyday use, but still something to think about when buying. I'll proceed onto the positives now, as per request of the gentleman in the suit, next to the exit. 

First of all, mileage is incredible. I average 55mpg (overall) by driving conservatively. I once ran half a tank out by driving like a jerk, and still pulled off 40mpg (overall). It's fuel consumption is excellent, and what with gas prices being sketchy and fossil fuels disappearing rapidly, this is something that I rely on tremendously. At last look, diesel was $1.49 a gallon, and gas was $1.59, so that's 10 cents and 20 miles on each gallon in comparison to a mileage friendly gas car. 

Second on the list is power. In the manual it draws comparisons up for you between the different engines. My 90hp TDI has about the same amount of torque as a 1.8T (170hp, I believe). It's not fast off the line, but it will tow practically anything I put behind it. I'd say it falls just a hair or two shorter on the speed category when put side by side with the 1.8T. It also has an attitude problem, as it always seems like it's out to prove itself. In saying this, I mean to say, you will squawk the tires, and often if you aren't careful. However, you'll only get this little rush of speed if you get the 5 speed manual. I've driven the automatic in comparison, and it's a dog when put next to the 5 speed. 

Third is design. Nothing beats a german car for comfort and look. I wish the seats were a little lower, but overall it's nice to sit in, and it looks good. I recently had the chance to look at the dash of a BMW 3 series, and well, my dash looks very similar, and feels nicer. If you want style and don't want a chincy feel, you have to go with a VW or an Audi. BMW is starting to come around, and they have the right idea with the Mini, but everything still feels plastic. Aside from the cup holder and vents, I'd say the layout inside is perfect. I think the outside of the car looks a bit Japanese (headlights), but overall, it's a very sleek and stylish looking car. 

Next up and fourth is handling. This car can cut corners like you wouldn't believe. I've driven Golf's, A4's, Passat's, A6's, 3 series, Mini's, and well, the only ones that compare to it is the Mini and the Golf. The Mini is a toss and turn sort of a ride, and the Golf is similar. The jetta, however, is a much more refined ride, and reminds me of the Audi A6 more than anything. I understand that we're talking a $20,000 price difference here, but I think as far as suspension and steering and road handling goes, VW hit the nail on the head with this one. I am sure, however, that this would probably change with a set of lo-profile tires and rims, but I think the ride is great. 

So that's my synapses, I hope it helps the consumer choose. I'd recommend this car, and I'm actually considering buying this one when my lease is up. It's a great little ride, and it does have it's quirks, but don't all cars?
