            We bought a used Dodge Intrepid ('98 model) last year.  I have truly enjoyed this car, more than any other I've ever owned.  I had never owned anything that was the least bit 'sporty' before, always practical.  With three kids, you have to be practical, right?  Not anymore!  The Intrepid has the sporty appearance on the outside, but inside there is plenty of room for our large family.  The backseat has a lot more leg room that you'd expect and the trunk capacity is unbelievable as well.  They've finally made a sporty, family car and we love it!  We get about 25 mpg's in the city traffic and almost 30 on the highway, so that's pretty practical, too.<br><br>
