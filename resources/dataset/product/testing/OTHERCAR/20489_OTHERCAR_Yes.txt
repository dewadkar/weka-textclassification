                I bought the car from a family friend that's had it for about two years.  We needed a comfortable and reliable car.  It's a '95, but still looks great.  We've owned it for almost four years.  Everyone in the family loves the four-door sedan.  When you start the car, it runs very smoothly.  Sometimes it feels like you're not in a car, which is really nice when you're taking long road trips.  The noise is enough from the kids in the back, you don't need noise from the car, too.  
    The only set back is that sometimes when you roll the windows down, it gets stuck and takes a few minutes to roll it back up.  But other than that, the car's maintenance has been very little.  I think if you want a car that you don't really want to worry too much about, the Oldsmobile is the right car for you.<br><br>
