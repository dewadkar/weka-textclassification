            The Canon PowerShot S330 lives up to and surpasses Canon's Digital Elph line reputation. This was my second digital camera and I couldn't be happier with it. For basic picture taking and portability, look no further. 

The metal casing is a bit heavy but assures you that the camera is of high quality and durability. The picture quality is excellent and it offers you a wide range of options to enhance or add effects to the photo. The interface is very user friendly and easy to figure out without reading the extensive manual. It's added features such as 3X optical zoom/ 2.5X digital zoom come in handy. Although the zoom is not all that powerful, this camera is more or less for standard picture taking. 

The featured gimmicks such as voice memo and movie effect are neat but rather useless. The battery life is horrid. Unlike Sony's line of digital cameras, Canon does not use standard AA or AAA batteries. Included with the camera is Canon's own "high-capacity" rechargeable battery and charger. The battery charges fairly quickly but also gets drained even faster. To buy a spare battery retails at around $60. Also included is a cheap useless 8MB flash media card and a strap. That's it!

I've only had the camera for a few months now but for some reason when I take a snapshot the camera's response time is delayed. After reading the manual I realized that the camera is shooting an infra red beam to gauge it's focus point. However it's still annoying because unless you're taking a still shot, you can count on having a picture of the object or person in the moment after. Maybe I'm just a bone head.

At any rate if you have the opportunity to make it out to the Caribbean buy this camera or any other digital camera there. It's so much cheaper after a little haggling and no tax! Great camera overall!
