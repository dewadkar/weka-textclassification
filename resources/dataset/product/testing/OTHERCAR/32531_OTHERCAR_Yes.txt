            I own a Saturn SC1 and on Nov 14th, 1999, I thanked God that I made that choice in vehicles.  We were broad sided by another car and our vehicle was flung onto the ramp of a busy highway, where we were struck a second time.  If it had not been for the steel reinforced bars across the doors, I most surely would have lost the love of my life.  Instead, thanks to Saturn's outstanding reputation in safety, we survived a near tragedy.  
  I admit that when I searched for a vehicle a few years ago, image was what caught me first.  And Saturn lived up to that classy image.  It was sleek and sexy and something that I was proud to be seen in around town.  But this was from a youth's frame of mind.  Safety was the farest thing from my mind on that day, however 3 years later, with my sweetheart by my side, my opinion of what's important in a vehicle matured immediately as we walked away from that vehicle on that fateful day in November 1999.<br><br>
