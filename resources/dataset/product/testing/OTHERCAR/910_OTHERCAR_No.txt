            Recently purchased the Lincoln LS 2000 two months ago and have found a number of items that need re-engineering and re-work. Firstly, the cigarette lighter when used for a ancillary power source for a plug in phone is always in the &quot;ON&quot; position, even when the car is shut off.

Secondly, the cup holders accommodate nothing more than a small coffee cup
at best, and even some of those won't fit. This becomes a major aggravation, as the driver is fumbling around for another place to put the coffee or drink cup. A little imagination by the engineering department could have fixed this.

The car handles extremely well. For all the hoopla, it dosen't come close to the BMW 528, even though the salespeople claim that this model was designed by a former BMW design engineer. I can now understand why he is not at BMW.<br><br>
