            After three months of ownership, I am impressed with my VW Passat sedan.  

I opted for the 4 cyl. over the V6 as I couldn't justify the extra money for ONLY 20 more HP, and honestly I refuse to purchase a six cylinder under 210 hp.

It is a solid automobile, at a reasonable cost, with adequate power, room, and trunk capacity.  Also, the only VW still produced in Germany. 

The placement of the radio is questionable, so opt for the steering wheel controls if you frequently tune stations.

Positive items includes braking, handling, manual transmission, turbo (not overly or under powered - and minimum lag), GREAT gas mileage (avg. about 28 in NYC), respectable design and lighting - not overly immature but not a wood grain panel either, and like the commercial - people think it is more expensive vs. its true value.

Negative items - I have a slender frame and still haven't discovered the most comfortable seat adjustment for long trips, the temperature guage on the dash is NEVER accurate (always a few degrees above real temperature),squeak from passenger side over bumps/potholes, and seats attract lint!
