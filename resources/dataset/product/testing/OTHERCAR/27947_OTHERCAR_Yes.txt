            The A4 strikes a nice balance between comfort/luxury features and sporty handling.  It's very fun to drive, has good pickup and braking, and is very well made.  One of the things that appealed to me immediately when I first got in the car was how solid all of the controls felt -- I don't like knobs that feel hard to turn or feel like they will break after a year of use, and all of the Audi controls feel really solid, yet look sleek.

They have clearly put a lot of thought into the ergonomic design of the car.  For example, the logic in the windows is surprisingly detailed and well done -- for example, if you turn off the car it lets you continue to roll the window up and down (so you don't have to re-start the car if you forgot to close before turning off), but disables the window controls after you open the door (so that if you leave an animal or small child in the car they can't mess with the controls).  Also, if you put the key in the door and turn and hold it, all four windows go down at once (so you can cool off the car quickly before entering on a hot day).  There are lots of little things like this that Audi has thought of in the control automation of the car.

For the most part the controls are also very intuitively designed and laid out.  However, some could have been done better.  For one, the front passenger seat has a 4&quot; knob on the side used to lower the seat -- it takes a ridiculous amount of cranking back to get it to lower the seat far enough for the passenger to sleep while you're driving.  I much prefer a lever that lets you drop the seat back quickly.  Also, the cruise control &quot;set&quot; switch is inconveniently near the headlight control,
so you have to slip your finger between them to engage it.  There also is no rear windshield wiper, which surprised me because that's a useful feature that most cars that cost $10k less than this car have.  And there's no way to &quot;pop&quot; the trunk open from inside the car -- you have to unlock it using the door unlock button, and then go to the trunk and push the trunk button and open it.  Also, I wish they had an option to use the same manual control on the driver's side as on the passenger's side for controlling how far the seat is pulled forward -- the electrically controlled seat slides slowly.  The passenger side has a very solid, nice feeling manual control and I would prefer to have one just like it on the driver's side.

The windshield fluid that comes with the car is really strong smelling --  if you run it with any vent open, the car fills with a strong odor like rubbing alcohol.  This is easily solved by refilling with a different fluid.  They told me the supplied fluid works better, but I'd rather use ordinary fluid without the &quot;toxic&quot; fumes.

The front seats have a wonderful amount of leg room, if the seats are all the way back.  However, when they are all the way back the rear seats have too little leg room for anyone bigger than a small child.  I suppose it's an OK tradeoff, because you can pull up the front seats a ways to accommodate passengers in the back, but when I first got the car I thought it was pretty ridiculous that the seats could be back so far that no one could sit in back.

The stereo system is easy to use and sounds great.  I like the look, too, with a power knob located centrally that pushes flush with the counter when the stereo is turned off.  Ample speakers around the car ensure well distributed sound.

The air conditioning system is awesome -- it blows more volume of cold air than I have ever seen in other cars.  It tries to be perhaps too intelligent in how it relates temperature and airflow volume, though -- when you turn down to the lowest temperature setting it blasts the volume to full (which usually is right -- getting into a hot car you want A/C on full), but if you turn it up just one degree it reduces volume a lot, for example.  I often have to adjust the volume again after changing the temperature, and I would prefer if they had just left the controls completely de-coupled.  

The braking system works quite well, although if you step hard on the brakes the ABS engages and the pumping feeling is transmitted through to your foot in a way that and feels like something is scraping and broken.  Perhaps this is just the way ABS systems work -- it's the first car I have owned that had ABS -- but it feels weird.

Overall, I heartily recommend this car, as well as the courteous and professional people I have always encountered who work for Audi.<br>
