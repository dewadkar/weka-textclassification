            This mid-sized SUV is priced just right for those looking for a bare bones jeep or those who want all the goodies for a good price.

My review will concentrate on what I noticed after a test drive, visiting fan Saturn websites and talking to the salesman. I will not put in technical information because you can find that at the Saturn website. =)

EXTERIOR
-----------
Subjectively, I do not like the design. The rear looks alright, but the front has that 'saturn' brand look that does not appeal to me. However, many people do like it.

The car looks a lot better in person. Check it out. The plastic moulding body panels are a nice feature, but the negative point is that they do not muffle enough sound from the engine out.

The handles on the doors are great. I love this design done by Saturn.

The V6 versions comes with alloy wheels. They are optional on the I4 model. I suggest them as they are only roughly $500 CDN and are a big improvement in looks.

Lots of body roll in this car. Feels worse than a minivan.

INTERIOR
-----------
Very poor build quality and bad design. The steering wheel looks hideous. I really wish GM would take a look at the Japanese vehicles and take a few notes. The radio is sufficient and has a 6-speaker system. Everything inside the car does not look durable. Ugh. If it looks like this now, imagine how it will look in a few years when it goes out of style and gets old.

There is a power package available w/powerwindows, keyless entry and more (roughly $1600 CDN). There is also a moonroof option. On-star is an option.

ENGINE
----------
Two options. V6 and Inline 4 (I4)

4-wheel drive with V6 or I4
2-wheel drive with I4 (variable valve timing)

The I4 version of the car is not yet done because of the continous variable tranmissions (CVT) like the one found in the new Audi A4 series. I suspect Saturn is having problems.

The only engine available now is the 200 hp V6 and it is loud, torquey and not something I liked too much. However, to be fair to GM, the engine is sufficient enough to pull this jeep around but comes at a premium price.

If I had a choice of the I4 or V6, based on what is on paper, I would choose the I4 for it's technology but i'm not sure if 140 hp is enough to haul a mid-sized SUV.

CONCLUSION
-------------
I'm really happy Saturn has come far enough to design their own vehicles that are unique but old problems of build quality still plague this vehicle.

I recommend you check out the newly redesigned Honda CRV and Toyota Rav4 in addition to this vehicle.
