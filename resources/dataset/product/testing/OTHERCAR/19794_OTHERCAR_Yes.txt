            This REVIEW is on the VOLVO S60R a limited, special edition version of the S60.

<b>Basics:</b>
Too many to list!
http://new.volvocars.com/r/specs.shtml -- Volvo Specs List

<b>The Positives:</b>
* 300 HP, 295 Lb-Ft Torque
* 4C Adjustable Suspension: Comfort, Sport, Advanced. Adjusts on the fly in milliseconds.
* Sharp Sedan Styling.
* 13 Speakers, Excellent Stereo Sound (Dolby Pro Logic), Holds 4 CD's.
* Excellent Fit & Finish. Smooth moving handles, buttons, doors, etc.
* Safety, Safety, Safety.  Volvo, as usual, makes a safe vehicle with enough air bags/side air bags to make you wonder if this car would float in water.  Shoulder belts all the way around.
* 4-piston Brembo Brakes on large rotors.
* ABS
* 18" Pegasus Rims (optional) with Pirelli P-Zero Rosso's 235/40
* ALL WHEEL DRIVE (Haldex split 90/10 and adjusts to 30/70)
* 6-Speed Manual Transmission
* Steering wheel Cruise Control, Stereo Adjustment buttons, Steering wheel adjustment.  Twin trip odometers.
* 3-position seat memories/side view mirror memories. Comfy seats.
* Turbo with Twin Intercoolers
* Folding rear seats, pass through middle seat.  
* Fairly short throw shifter with minimal play and speedball handle.
* Dynamic Stability & Traction Control
* Excellent Ergonomics. Beautiful dash (blue metallic gauges with chrome tips).  Everything is electonically software controlled.  Even the map lights turn on & off like a dimmer. Aluminum interior trim.  No interior squeaks.
* 4 year/50,000 mile warranty with 3 year/36K free maintenance. Volvo 4 year On Call Roadside Assistance.
* Moonroof with Sunshade
* Bi-Xenon High & Low beams. Daytime running lights. Fog lamps.
* Rain sensing windshield wipers. Wipers for your headlamps.
* Heated seats (option).  Excellent climate control.  Vents for people in the rear seats.
* Minor sport fascia changes, rear spoiler (albeit small)
* Alarm with remote locking key/chain, trunk release, panic button.
* Electronic computer giving you Messages, Avg MPG, Instantaneous MPG, Avg Speed, etc.
* My auto insurance only went up an extra $200 a year from a car I traded in for only $700!!! and was definitely in a lower class.  You'll definitely need to check with your own insurance provider to see how a volvo will increase (OR DECREASE) your costs.

<b>Negatives:</b>
* Gas Mileage is very poor in the city (~13-15 mpg), I have achieved up to 30 mpg highway Long Distance (Avg ~25-27). Requires premium gasoline.
* It probably does not achieve the 0-60 in 5.4 seconds as published by Volvo. Closer to low 6's but this of course has a driver skill component to it (manual transmission).
* A clutch that takes some time to get accustomed to.
* Poor ergonomic location of cup holders.  Coin holder is more apt for non-US coins.  Poor location of left foot rest.
* Buzzing shifter (there are service dept fixes for this)
* Clunk from suspension (there are software updates for this)
* Some people do not like the dial radio/CD controls.
* Very poor turning radius
* It's only 5-cylinders.  (Supposedly had to be for the Transverse mounting and safety feature behind this type of placement in the engine bay).
* Turbo - always possible additional costs with a turbo vehicle and some (but minimal) turbo lag.
* Slightly noisy climate control when on FULL blast.
* Although the Pirelli P-Zero Rosso's afford amazing traction but they have a very low treadlife of ~10,000 miles.  This means you will probably need to replace them within 2 years of owning the vehicle.  (Would definitely recommend some other Ultrahigh performance tire with longer treadlife -- Consumer Reports has recently reviewed some tires late in 2003).
* Because of the electronic technology in this car, this car may be expensive to maintain once the warranty expires.
* AM Radio reception degrades greatly with aftermarket tinted windows since the Antenna is built into the rear window.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE: The Geartronic (Automatic) version of this car does not have the same torque nor the same acceleration capabilities of the Manual Transmission.  This has been a huge issue for many people after purchasing the Geartronic S60R.  

<b>Overall:</b>
I don't mean to discount other reviewers that test drive these cars, but please take into consideration that I ACTUALLY OWN this vehicle, have SPENT MONEY for this car, and drive it DAILY (i.e. more than 10 minutes with a sales person), and have really pushed it hard!  (AND BOY DOES IT ROCK!!!)

This car was a major change from a 2-door coupe to a 4-door sedan for me.  I was looking at the following corresponding vehicles: Infinity G35, BMW 3 series with performance package, BMW M3, Audi S4, Acura TL, to name a few.

Nothing, at least at the time of my purchase, came close to what this car has and gives for $40,000.  If you compare the performance numbers, HP, Torque, quality, reputation, reliability, and safety --&gt; the Volvo S60R is THE CAR.  In fact, in Europe this car is supposedly closer to $55,000 US which would place you in the ballpark of an M3 or S4.  Thus, I truly feel that it's a great deal here in the states.  The other cars that may be below the $40K mark such as the Infinity G35 do not have the same quality, thrill, excitement, or power of the S60R.   

This car is exceptionally smooth at any speed.  You have all this power under your right foot with safety to boot.  The car EASILY pulls past other vehicles at whatever speed and even in higher gears (4 - 6th!).  I easily can pass in the left lane while in 6th gear and I DO NOT have to shift to a lower gear.  However, it sure is fun to toss it down to 3rd or 4th and fly by.  Acceleration from near standstill is exceptionally impressive without much intrusive engine sound in the cabin.  The turbo lag is evident below 2200 RPM despite the claims of a flat torque band starting at 1950 RPM.  The adjustable suspension is not a novelty feature as other's may have stated.  If you truly own this car, you will notice the difference!  What car allows you to adjust this quality depending on your style or your mood! The throttle response is also slightly modified with this setting.  The front has more than adequate space.  The back is generally comfortable but leg room will be cramped with tall front passengers and their seats back.  The trunk is huge but the entrance space, despite the lid opening over 90 degrees, still makes it hard to put large objects into it (as evidenced when I bought a home theater system with tall speakers in a huge box).

I know that I am very satisfied with the car at this point in time (3500 miles on the car).  I do expect that with the amount of technology placed in this car that in the long run it might be an expensive car to maintain once the warranty expires.  It also does have some negatives which I have listed forthright above.  There may be additional hidden costs such as switching to WINTER TIRES in snow states (the Stock Pirelli P-Zero Rosso's are not suitable for snow driving) as well as the risk of tire & rim damage since it is running low-profile tires.  Right now with Dunlop Winter Sport M2's on my 18" rims with the DSTC, AWD, and ABS, it's actually been a blast in the snow.  It's almost difficult to get the tires to spin with the AWD.  The ABS with the Brembo Brakes brought me to an excellent straight line emergency stop with snow on the ground at a stop light earlier today.

A car, obviously isn't a simple purchase nor an inexpensive item to buy.  I encourage you to visit the two web sites below before making your final decision!

Good Luck!!!

For the true soccer mom/dad image, the S60R has an equivalent Station Wagon -&gt; V70R.  Fast and utilitarian all in one!  Get the manual transmission of course (not the geartronic).  Pretty amazing that a lot of cars on the road will lose to a station wagon leaving from a stop light!

One last comment: Some states and some dealers have not been allowing Test Drives of the S60R since it is a special edition.  You may have to test the S60 T5 but remember it is still NOT the S60R in terms of HP, Torque, suspension.

Actually, one last thing: The Volvo S60 2.5T (208 HP, 236 Torque), nearly fully loaded is priced at $35K.  The S60R (300 HP, 295 Torque)with my options (18" alloys, climate package, premium sound package, and leather, plus more is only $4K - $5K more).  Pretty much a no-brainer.
