            The 1998 Plymouth Neon Expresso is a fairly good car.  The car has good styling and a wonderful interior, but it lacks a strong engine.  The styling is unlike most Neons.  It has a bit of an aggressive look to it.  The back sits up very high, and this blocks rear visibility greatly.  I had much trouble backing up.  The interior is very comfortable and roomy.It will hold four people comfortably. I found the seats very comfortable.  I also liked how they sit very low to the ground.  The trunk is fairly large for the size of the car. The spare tire is located under the trunk, saving trunk space.  The engine gets great gas mileage, but it lacks power.  The DOHC engine is the largest engine offered on the Expresso.  I would guess it has about 100 hp.  I was not confident pulling into traffic.  The automatic transmission really hesitates to down shift.  A 5 speed manual would have suited the car much better.  The car is very reliable.  I experienced no major mechanical malfunctions.  This car is a good car for beginning drivers, or little old ladies who only drive to the store once a week.<br><br>
