            When a lawyer unexpectedly uncovered a small amount of cash my father, dead for 15 years, had left to us, my first instinct was to purchase that much-needed new car.  The research led us to the Subaru not only for reliability and cost but because of the reputation of a local dealer.  Now, I realize that the "legacy" money was tainted...who knows why....Maybe the car was made on a Monday...maybe we're just weird...here's our story...

The dealer called us three weeks earlier than we expected to tell us our new car was in.  We picked it up Friday afternoon grooving because we could take it on our upcoming vacation on Tuesday.  Sunday morning I noticed a fine crack growing in the windshield but that proved to be a minor concern after a truck towing an unlicensed trailer ran into the car on day 3 (while we were stopped at a red light).  Not only did we have the lovely whiplash for our vacation but the repairs took three weeks to finish (be ready for that kind of parts delay if you are unlucky like us!). 

The first time I drove in snow I was stunned to read in the manual that the car was not blowing up but that the jarring noise and shudder were part of the so-called vehicle traction control (or something along those lines...).  I anticipated much greater traction than I got from the four wheel drive--the snow-covered drives still made me slip. 

 My newest peeve is the tires.  I had a blowout on December 14 which I repaired only to have it go again the next day.  It took a full week to get a tire ordered and on the car and on Tuesday (May 1) another tire blew--this one so badly that I will simply have to replace it (again, there is a week-long wait)  The dealer says that's life and there is no warranty.  

Meanwhile I also got a notice saying I need to leave the car for a day because of a seatbelt safety recall.  While I know the accident is not a part of every car, the parts delay issue sure is and the multiplicity of problems on a NEWWWWW car that cost upwards of $20,000 is verrrrrrry troubling. 

I like the car but not enough to make up for all of these things and, despite the dealer's excellent reputation, I have not found the service that outstanding. I would at least want someone to say why don't you try contacting "so and so" about the tires (made, of course, by Firestone).  

We all have a big laugh over the fact that my father's ghost (he worked for a Chevy dealership) is expressing its dissatisfaction with the Japanese car.

But when the time comes, I will go back to a Honda.
