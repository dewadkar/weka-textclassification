            I was in the market for a digital camera. I wanted one with a high resolution but didn't want to spend a fortune on it. This one fit that description. I also liked the fact that it was a Polaroid.

The day the camera came I was chatting on line with my son. I opened the camera and played around. In a few minutes I had pictures of myself and my animals that looked pretty good. I loaded them into the computer and e-mailed them to my son. Quick &amp; easy. I like this camera. 

I have noticed that close up pictures work best. There is no zoom feature and the farther away the subject is the poorer the picture quality. If they are for computer usage though the included photomax software was easy to use and it enabled me to touch up the photos a bit before sending.

Digital cameras do go through batteries very quickly. I bought a recharger and spent the extra money for rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride batteries, which are recommended for digital cameras. They actually do last longer than the alkaline batteries. If you are close to a power source you can plug the camera in with the included cord and save battery life.

The view screen on the camera makes it easy to delete bad shots immediately. You can view your shots either one or nine at a time and delete any of them at any time. The menu has options to change from XGA to VGA mode for higher resolution. You can set the time and date, the amount of time before your camera shuts itself off, and the white balance for taking pictures in different types of lighting. I also really like the timer feature which makes it easy to get yourself in the picture.

There is a slide bar for close up or far away pictures, but I really haven't noticed that it makes that much difference when used. It also came with a cord for connecting to a video source, which I haven't tried out yet.

All in all this is a very nice camera for the price. Very easy to use and the pictures are pretty good quality.<br><br>
