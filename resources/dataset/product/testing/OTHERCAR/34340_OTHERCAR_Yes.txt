            I have owned my Buick since 53000 km and I am now approaching 60000 on it.  I must say it's the nicest car I've owned and driven in a while.  I previously owned a 1995 Grand AM which doesn't compare at all to the Buick.  I have also test driven a 2002 Malibu.  I have also rented a Lincoln Continental which I think is almost comparable to this vehicle, but not quite.

I was very pleasantly surprised by all of the basic features on this model.  There is an indicator light for low fuel, low washer fluid, change engine oil soon, low tire pressure to name a few.  As well, the three built-in tether hooks in the back for car seats are a must have for me as I have two small children.  

I took a while to get used to the size of the car as I was previously in a smaller car.  As well due to the high back, I'm still not entirely comfortable when backing up (I tend to over estimate the size of the back).  

I would rate this vehicle average to above average on acceleration.  Due to it's size and weight, it's not a sports car and I don't think it was meant to appeal to that type of consumer.  

I find that overall the Buick Century is easy to handle.  It's a great car at a reasonable price.
