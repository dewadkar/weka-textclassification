            I have owned a number of performance cars, raced and driven many more, all I can say is hands down this is the best blending of performance and comfort I have ever found. My 944 Turbo S with $20,000 in race upgrades was a little quicker/faster and could hold the G-Pad a bit longer but it also beat the tar out of you on the street, and one of the years I owned it, it cost me over $10,000 in repairs and maintenance. I have not spent a dime on the M3 in the one year I have owned it. 

My first "sports car", if you can call it that, was an �85 Ford Mustang with a 5.0. That car was a little quicker in a straight line then the M3, at least it was after some not so legal mods. If you like doing "smoke shows", 360s for seemingly no reason and cornering like a dog on a hardwood floor get a Mustang the M3 is not for you. The M3 is almost impossible to spin or even get squirly with the ACS engaged and if you need to know how it corners, all I can say is it�s godlike. Then there was the 928s EURO I owned , It was fast, comfortable and handled well but it was no light weight sport coupe. The M3 would run circles around it on the track and on the Highway would give it a run for the money (after being chipped) all the way up to about 150mph (the 928 went over 165 mph, ask me how I know :-) 

All I can Say is buy this car!!! I paid about $25,000 for mine with less then 32,000 miles on it and I got an incredible deal. But for anything under $28,000 & 45,000 miles your getting a great car. 

DON�T PAY THE DEALERS BS INFLATED PRICES 

I HAVE SEEN THIS CAR FOR OVER $45,000 WITH HIGHER MILEAGE THEN MINE
