<TEXT>
            I owned a Grand Am back in 1993, and I can honestly say that is was one of my favorite cars.  It always had great pick up, ran great, and never gave me much problem.  I am a Pontiac man, and it was my second after owning a Sunbird in the early nineties.  

I liked it better than the Sunbird because it was a little roomier, and more stylish.  The Grand Am has a unique body style that has not been successfully copied or imitated, and it was a true pleasure to own and drive.

Like most Pontiac styles, it has a great capacity to hug the road, no matter what speed you are driving at, and it is comfortable and nice looking.  I hated to get rid of mine, but had to upgrade to a mini-van, like so many of us, once the kids came along.  I would definitely recommend it as a starter car, though, for singles, or newly married couples.  I miss mine still.<br><br>
