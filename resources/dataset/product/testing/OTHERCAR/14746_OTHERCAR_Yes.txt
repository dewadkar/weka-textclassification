            EDITED (7/9/00):  I originally had this review listed under &quot;Honda CRX&quot; but for some reason Epinions has stuck it in the 1991 year, even though it was a 1988.  So please don't rate me lower for this, I had no control over it - Thanks!!

I have been the proud owner of 3 VERY CUTE Honda CRX's, an '85, '86, and a 1988.  I kept my 1988 for almost 10 years.  When I sold my CRX to buy a new Chevy Cavalier, it had 95,000 trouble free miles on it.  I wish I had it back.  My friend I sold it to put 40,000 miles on it before she got rid of it (still in good shape when she sold it).

The only drawback was because the muffler was exposed to the elements, it had to be replaced almost yearly.  Also, the back wheel wells tend to rust out pretty quickly.  I should have just had the rust fixed and kept it.

I was always worried about that smoked glass area that was part of the hatch - what would happen if I was rear ended?  Well, I was, by a woman who had a bad day at work and wasn't watching.  She hit me when I was stopped at a traffic light at about 20 mph.  That Honda is one tough car.  The glass area did not break; in fact, the only thing that happened was the bumper was pushed in as far as it would go and the trunk lock broke.

I wish Honda would bring back back the CRX.  I would be first in line to buy a NEW one.  The car was a &quot;pocket rocket&quot;.  I had the middle of the road model, the DX.  It handled extremely well, the stick shift was very smooth.  I loved the way it took corners - you didn't even have to brake!  It still got &quot;looks&quot; after 10 years.  The factory stereo sounded great.  The only money I ever spent on it was routine maintenance.  I miss it.<br><br>
