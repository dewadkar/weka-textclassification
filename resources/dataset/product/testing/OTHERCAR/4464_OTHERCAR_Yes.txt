            When I was in College, everyone knew who I was as I sped through the little town of Greenville, NC...All because of the car I owned..A Cherry Red VW Cabriolet Convertible.  It was cute, sporty, and very noticeable; not to mention, got great gas mileage and had a pretty good engine!!  I loved that car, but what college female wouldn't?  Every chance I had, my top was down!!  After I graduated from college and got a &quot;real job&quot;, I decided that I needed a grown-up car so I bought a Honda Civic Coupe (still red).  That car was great also, don't get me wrong, but I still dreamed of my VW Convertible often.  
   Well, I recently turned the BIG 30 and decided it was now time for a &quot;fun car&quot; once again.  I didn't feel like 30, I certainly didn't act like 30 either!!  Can you guess what I got?  Yep, a VW Cabrio (as they are now called...and of course, Cherry Red!!  Still the same great VW make, great gas mileage and simply the most fun to drive..Doesn't matter how old you actually are..This convertible can be driven by any age and will make you feel great!!  And don't forget to take your top off on a good sunny day!!<br><br>
