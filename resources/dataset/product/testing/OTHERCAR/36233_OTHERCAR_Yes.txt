            I bought this car used.  The former owner of it had put a fair amount of money into repairing it, and had finally decided to sell.  Based on my own experience with the car, and knowledge of the mechanic involved, I believe the car was not at fault.


<b> #1 for me - Show Me The Money! </b>

I've owned this car for about five years now.  A couple of years ago I had to put about four or five hundred dollars worth of repairs into it, and was unhappy about the bill.  Considering the age of the car and the mileage on it, the bill is hardly unreasonable as compared to the cost of a new car, or even a good used car.  Repairs are just one of those things you have to pay for, like insurance, which costs me much more.  The last couple of inspections have gone off without a hitch.  Most years I think the average for repairs comes to less than $200.00.  The car gets good mileage.  I guess I'll give this car at least a B+ for wallet friendliness, considering my own lack of expertise in auto repairs.



<b> Department of Interior </b>

Neither my wife nor I are small people.  When she moves the driver's seat back far enough for her to get comfortable, there isn't that much room for someone with long legs to sit behind her.  I guess that's why they call them compact cars.  Considering the size of the car there's a fair amount of room inside it.


<b> Performance </b>

This review is for the non power owner - I'm not an expert on performance, not alert to every little nuance, and don't have a huge basis for comparison.  The steering handles easily enough.  Sometimes it seems you feel the bumps and potholes a little more than it other cars, certainly more than in my wife's Corolla which is of comparable size but much newer.  My mechanic replaced a doohickey and it may be a little smoother, I'm not sure, but at least in part this may be the way the car is.
