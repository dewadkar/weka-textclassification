            This is our second Volvo,we decided on the wagon this time around because we like to travel with our huge dogs and SUVs are not the safest thing out there. It's a very elegant car and for the money it surpasses all the really expensive  BMW and Mercedes wagons.
We love the way it handles because you feel that you are driving a performance car when you can easily pass another car at 120mph and it feels as steady as if you were doing 50mph.
Last March we drove from Texas to Quebec and encountered rain, sleet, icy roads, snow, fog, and high winds, we were as comfortable as if we had been sitting in a first class seat with the best airline.
This car is for everyone who values their safety as well as their family's. Anyone who wants a very classy car but pays for the car itself and not for the logo. Pick up drivers with NRA bumper stickers stay away.
My wife got over the &quot;mommy car&quot; issues very quickly with this vehicle.<br><br>
