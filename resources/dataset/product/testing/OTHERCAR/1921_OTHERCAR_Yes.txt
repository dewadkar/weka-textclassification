            In purchasing my first new car, I did about as much research and weighed about as many options as were possible in buying a car.  It is safe to say that I was confident in my decision to purchase the 2000 Nissan Maxima GLE and that I haven't lamented the decision for a single one of the 6000 miles I've driven it so far.  What I thought was a simple cosmetic redesign turned out to be much more.

At an MSRP of $26,249, the GLE comes standard with some amazingly comfortable and adjustable leather seats (6 way adjustable driver seat, 4 way passenger).  The interior is sculpted without many curves, but all instruments and controls are easily within the drivers reach, with the clock located only inches below the windshield (nice for those of us sitting in traffic worried about being late for work).  With standard automatic transmission, the transmission shifter is designed wonderfully with beveled indicators set atop a wood grained finish, which is also located around the stereo, climate control, and window/door lock controls.

The automatic climate control is extremely intuitive and anticipates changing interior conditions adjusting airflow between the dash and floor vents, and with an impressive top speed fan, cold winter weather and hot summer sun are barely noticed.  Also barely noticed are the dashboard air vents which close to a sleek seamless panel.  But just above the climate console is the Bose 7 speaker CD player and stereo system which absolutely cranks out music that sails  out over the otherwise very quiet ride.  And the subwoofer in the back seat mandates a drum and bass CD (I toss in Underworld and the car shakes).

But what really shakes the Maxima is what's under the hood.  The 222 horsepower V6 engine provides more pop than your Sunday driver needs, but just enough for your car enthusiast to remember he's got a big engine spinning.  And while it is 5 hps smaller than its twin brother, the Infinity i30 (identical in almost every other way), make no mistake -- this is a car that will toast the other V6 competition off the line.  The Volkswagon Passat might have a sporty looking euro design, but it lacks 32 horses on the Maxima.  And to keep you safe at top speeds, the Maxima is comes standard with ABS brakes, dual front airbags, is available with traction control and dual side airbags (all of which I purchased at a reasonable cost to the safety benefits).

On the down side though, at highway speeds, the Maxima steering is quite synthetic, and too loose.  While response time is acceptable, the deceptive speed (you think you are traveling at 40 when you're going 80), coupled with the lack of steering sensitivity, provides a very electronic interface to the mechanics of the car.  And the doors don't unlock when you pull the chrome lever from the inside front seats.  But those are my only two gripes.

And they are well tempered with extremely bright headlights, fog lights, and super powerful high beams.  The trunk is too large for any man, and you'll find yourself giving your relatives rides to the airport more often than you'd like.

In all, it's a $30,000 car that you're getting a steal on.  I can't think of a reason not to own it.  And to prove it, when I brought it in for a tune-up, work stopped on all other cars as the mechanics flocked around my Maxima and berated me with questions.  Maybe the attention you'll get is the only downside.<br><br>
