            I currently own a 1999 Mercedes CLK320 and did not expect to be in the market for a new car for another year.  However, I cannot resist a breakthrough car.  While the CLK is an excellent vehicle, I have ultimately determined it is a bit soft for my tastes.  I looked at the A4 when I bought the CLK, it was a fine looking car with a terrific interior and nice feel, but it was too slow and not quite special enough.  The S4 is another story altogether.

When I heard about the S4 coming out I new Audi had the chance for something special.  They have delivered.  This car has a vault like solid feel to it.  The interior is very sporty, particularly with the optional suede-like Alcantara two tone optional interior.  It also has all the bells and whistles that matter to me (in dash CD, Bose, Xenon headlights, side airbags, etc.).  It does an excellent job of being sporty without being sparse and it is luxurious without feeling like you should have a chauffeur drive it.

The exterior modifications from a basic A4 are subtle but dramatic.  It looks lower, wider, and meaner, without the boy racer add-on feel sometimes noticeable on the M3.  The two S4 only colors Nogaro Blue and Imola yellow are my personal favorites.  

Driving the car is where the ultimate differentiation lies.  Around town it is a pleasure, but step on the gas and it is a monster, tamed by terrific handling and the all weather security of Quattro all wheel drive.  I owned a 95 BMW M3 that was a blast to drive also.  The S4 is less raw, but still intensely entertaining.

My M3 was a bit unrefined, my CLK is a bit soft, my soon to be S4 is right on the money and relative bargain at between $41K and $44K.  Wow, I can't wait.  I have a 2001 6 speed in Imola Yellow ordered and should receive it in August.  I thought about waiting for the new 2001 BMW M3 which will also be outstanding.  More horsepower than the S4 but the S4 is the king of torque, which results in relatively even 0-60 times.  The M3 is likely to cost more than $50K and will require up to a year's wait.  Besides I doubt the overall experience will equal that of the S4.<br><br>
