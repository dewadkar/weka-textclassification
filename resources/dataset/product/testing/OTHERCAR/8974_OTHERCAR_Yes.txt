            I just bought a usued 2000 Pontiac Grand Am SE1 coupe.  I love this car! It has the V6 3400 engine in it (very powerful!) The handling is great!  It turns on a dime!!  The 170 horsepower is awsome compared to my old car ('92 dodge daytona--100hp--pretty crappy to say the least).  When you hit the gas full throttle...hold on tight because this car really gets up!!  

The looks are good to say the very least.  Everywhere I go, people are quick to look and check out my ride.  The ripples on the sides of the car make it look all the more better, sportier, and fast. Add on the rear spoiler which  my car came with and look out...this car is hot!!  

The inside is just as nice as the outside. FORM = FUNCTION! The red display on the dash.  The air conditioning is ice cold...which is great for me because i get hot very easily, and in this car, I've never even been warm!  This car is equipped with daytime running lamps.  This can be a good thing but I would really like the option of being able to turn them off when i want to.  Maybe I'm just a control freak or something, but for me if i want to have my lights off, I'd like to be able to actually do that.  Same goes with the night lamps.  They automatically come on when it's dark enough.  This is both good and bad.  Since they automatically come on when it gets dark, that means you won't forget to turn them off when you shut off the car because you didn't turn them on in the first place (a life saver for you battery!).  The bad thing with this feature is the same as with the day. runn. lamps...YOU CAN'T TURN THEM OFF while you're car is on, that it.  So if i want to park and stay in my car to listen to some cd's, (that is hooked up to an amp and subs so you have to have the engine running)THE LIGHTS STAY ON...annoying if you ask me.  Anyways, enough about that.

The roominess of this car is remarkable.  Especially for the 2 door coupe like I have.  You hear "2 Door" and you assume "no back seat room".  If you assume this about this car...either you're 6'8" or you're a moron because the back seats are the roomiest I've ever seen and I was pleasantly surprised when I went to sit in the back, and I was actually comfortable!  As for the front seats...even better.  The "cockpit" styling for the driver's seat is very useful.  It allows you to control the setting of your radio/cd player/air cond., etc. with little effort and doesn't distract you from the road.

In addition, the reliability of this car is something to look forward to.  It has a full factory warrany under 3 yrs or 36k miles, and a limited warrant for un to 6 yrs or 100k miles (whichever comes first).

The gas milage(city) and blind spots are the only other negative about this car.  It only gets 20 mpg in the city...not exactly what i expected.  Also the blind spots.  The reason for this I think is that the rear of the car is higher than what is typical and if you have a rear soiler, it limits you view a little more.  Basically LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER BEFORE CHANGING LANES!!  Don't trust only your rear view mirror and side mirrors...they can't see everything!  

All in all....I highly recomend this car.  I love it and I know you will to or your money back...j/k!  Seriously, if your considering this car to buy...go for it; and if your not considering it...consider it.  I hope I've been some help!
