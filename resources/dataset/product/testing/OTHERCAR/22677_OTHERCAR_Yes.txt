            I went out with the help of my father-in-law and purchased a 1998 Grand Am. We needed a family car when we got back from Germany.  It was a 4-door, SE model.  It was a standard transmission.  I loved this car.  It was still sporty enough that my husband didn't mind having a 4-door and it had a lot of pick up and go.  
It was a great ride, very smooth.  It came with running day lights that i have gotten so used to.  I forget when i drive other cars that don't have them to turn the headlights on.
I never had any big troubles out of the car.  We ended up trading it in for a mini-van so we could have more room for 2 children and all the things we have to take with us on long trips.  We got a Pontiac Transport and i really love it.  I do wish we could have kept both cars.  I miss driving a standard.
It gets great gas mileage--28/highway-24/city.  It cornered really tight and had 155 horsepower for a 4 cylinder.  The v-6's had 160 horsepower and was quite a bit more expensive.<br><br>
