            My Kodak DC-265 was a gift from my husband.  It took me just a few pictures to get over the price shock.  This camera is GREAT.  I use my computer to print my pictures and I will never go back to film again. 

I have become the picture taker for work now. They make sure I have my camera for all of our special events and this camera has sold itself over and over again to co-workers.

I never go anywhere with out my Kodak DC-265, even when we go on the motorcycle the camera has to go.
