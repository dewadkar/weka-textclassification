            We got our new Mountaineer in the fall.  I am the primary driver of the vehicle, chauffeuring kids to activities, doing chores, soccer mom-type usage.  I love the car--we got the fully, totally loaded Mountaineer--I don't think there's one option this doesn't have.  It's a V8, AWD.  
The biggest negative is IT GUZZLES GAS like it's going out of style!!!
We traded in a V6 Grand Cherokee and I would estimate that this vehicle
consumes half again as much gas as the Jeep did.  Just running around town and running the kids places, I have to fill up every 3 days!!!  The
increasing fuel prices make us doubly aware of the difference.  The
dealership fellows say that the V8, plus the AWD will certainly decrease gas mileage and we're seeing that.  <br><br>
