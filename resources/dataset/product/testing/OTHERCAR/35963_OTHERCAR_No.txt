            I bought my first ever Honda Civic in May 1999. I researched thoroughly before buying. I was looking for good gas economy, reliability and good resale value. I anticipated that I was getting the best. 

What I do like:
- Easy to drive.
- An excellent heater.
- Smooth engine.
- Quiet.

What I do not like and I am very disappointed in:
- Suspension noises (one shock has already been replaced)and still every couple of days or so I get a terrible coil spring boing noise.
- Poor gas mileage. 90% of my mileage is highway, yet I only get 32 MPG even at constant speeds of no more than 100 KPH.
- Windshield wipers that always streaked and had to be replaced in a rainstorm.
- Lack of options when I purchased. Despite Honda being Japanese, and the Japanese being so progressive, a CD player was not an option I could have installed at purchase.
- Poor tires. The steering is shimmering as I drive.
- Uncomfortable seating. I find more than two hours a strain.
- Poor traction on braking on rough surfaces. I have found the car skips if braking at a rough intersection and could end up travelling into the intersection.
- Cupholders cannot handle a long drink bottle due to overhead restrictions.

Who should buy:
- This is a good small family car.
- Not good for long distance driving, especially with adults in the back.
