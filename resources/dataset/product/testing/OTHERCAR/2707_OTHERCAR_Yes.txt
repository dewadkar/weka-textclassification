            The Toyota T100 is the best truck Toyota has ever come out with!!  My new T100 is intimidating on the road.  Its not as big as a full size, but not as small as a Tacoma.  Its the best truck I have ever owned and I should know, I have been through 5 trucks now.  I have been on two major trips with this truck and I just love it.  I had absolutely no problem taking this with me anywhere I went.  Toyota knew what they were doing when they made this truck.  Its my vehicular dream come true!  I promise you that if you are to purchase a T100, you will be totally satisfied, and completely swept away by the courtesy of the Toyota dealers.  There prices are right and there trucks are awesome.  You'll be sorry to invest in anything else.<br><br>
