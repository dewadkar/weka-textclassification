            Two years ago we decided it was time for a new family vehicle.  At the time I was still a stay at home Mom and my husband worked nights.  We only needed one vehicle. For us it was an economical decision.  

I know the last thing my husband wanted to be seen driving was a &quot;Mom-mobile.&quot; However &quot;family&quot; cars are simply not family sized anymore.  With three growing boys we needed a vehicle large enough for fifteen bags of groceries and three or four gallons of milk.  We needed something that had room for sports gear and folding chairs.  Roomy luggage area and seats for transporting friends on trips to the museum or park with us.  Something with some headroom for boys who are growing rapidly (as we expect this would turn into a second vehicle for us and be around for some time).  

We have found that vehicle in our 1993 (used) Dodge Grand Caravan.  We tried out several on the lot and I opted for the extended length Caravan.  Although the salesman claimed the foot room in the third row was the same in all vehicles, we found that was not so when we put all the boys in the van.

To date we have found our Caravan to be a very reliable vehicle only having the oil changed.  Presently we will be installing new brake pads (actually that &quot;we&quot; is actually my husband  ::smile::).  We also plan in looking into the belt. There is one that somehow runs various parts under the hood (I have a good idea what things may need to be done but please, don't make me go into to many details. I believe it's something to do with the water pump, alternator and radiator).  We believe this is normal maintenance that you would do to a vehicle (especially one that is over 100,000 miles).

We discovered this vehicle was exactly what we needed for road trips when we drove from Connecticut to Nova Scotia Canada two summers ago. It was a pleasant change to have room to pack everything &quot;and&quot; room to give those boys to move around! We were also able to put a large cooler in the middle for cold drinks and snacks (although the child in the middle did get out by walking through the front two seats and out the front door -- small price to pay, believe me).

It is fair to say that my husband has grown to like our Caravan. While I am sure he would much rather a sportier vehicle, the usefulness the van has been has made it worth it.  Did I mention the second and third rows of seats pop out?  Great for trips to Home Depot!  

Someday in the future I look forward to having a classier car all of my own.  I am sure my husband would love something sportier. For now though, we are a family with young children at home still and this is the vehicle for us.
