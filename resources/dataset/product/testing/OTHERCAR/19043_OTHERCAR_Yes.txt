            For a long time I had wanted to get a digital camera so that I could keep my personal webpage fresh and up-to-date. I initially looked at getting the C-2000 when they first came out but found the price prohibitive. Just recently, I saw the price on the C-2020z drop down to $699. That's when I picked it up. WOW! The pictures this camera takes are INCREDIBLE. They are sharp and saturated with color. Besides color pictures, you can also take b/w shots and sepia shots as well. There are also modes that let you photograph blackboards and whiteboard (for all you meeting attendees) so that they are very readable. You have multiple choices of resolutions and formats with which to save your photos. They run from compressed jpg all the way to uncompressed TIFF depending on your needs.Which brings me to another point... the 8mb SmartMedia card that is included with the camera is too small. You can only save 16 1600x1200 jpg's or 1 TIFF image in this space. I immediately ordered 2 32mb cards for it. Another thing is that you do not have a USB connection on the camera, only serial. Serial takes FOREVER. I went ahead and bought a USB reader for my PC which works like a champ. What used to take a LONG time via serial is over in a few seconds with the USB reader. FWIW, the SmartMedia cards and USB reader were all from SanDisk. 

You can use this camera right out of the box. To REALLY use it though requires some reading of the owner's manual. 

After doing some reading on the web about this camera, I picked up some other accessories as well. I got a lens tube adapter and some step-up rings to protect the lens assembly and facilitate the use of filters and other stuff. Don't buy the accessory kit from Olympus. Pick and choose your accessories and buy them separately. You'll come out cheaper that way. If you buy the accessory kit, you'll end up with a few items you can't/won't use.
