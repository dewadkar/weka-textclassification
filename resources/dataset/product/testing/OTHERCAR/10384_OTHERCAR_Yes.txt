    There are a few things you should know before buying a Kia Sephia.
its a lot of car for the money. I bought one for my wife after her Geo Metro was totaled. Shes a tiny woman and likes a small car. Boy! was I surprised when we got the Kia home. It was much bigger and roomier than I thought. This particular vehicle had real get up and go that would initially leave my Chevy lumina in the dust. Really has great pickup. Mileage is about average 32 mpg on highway/ 28 mpg city.It has a very comfortable ride and is quite quiet.       
      Now the con side The car doesn't come with hub caps, wheels look ugly without them. Not all the seats are adjustable up and down (driver) even though they have the slot for it.The windows are not tinted and this is a big problem because the sun visor is very short and small and leaves a lot to be desired. We went out and had the windows tinted.
Getting a spare key can be a challenge.
It can only be serviced by Kia dealerships.
In general we are very happy with it.
