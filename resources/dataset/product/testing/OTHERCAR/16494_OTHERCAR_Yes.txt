            I think Honda has done again with America's best selling small car.  After owning a 1998 Civic EX and a 1998 Cr-V LX, Honda remains at the top of my list for dependable and predictable quality.  

I am coming to the 2003 Civic from a 2003 Eclipse.  I enjoyed driving the Eclipse, but there was just something that wasn't there.  Don't get me wrong, Mitsubishi has improved and refined the Eclipse by leaps and bounds, but it still has very cheap looking interior plastic, carpeting and seats.  I think most of the cost of the Eclipse goes into its subtle, but nice engine and aggressive styling.  

The Civic offers efficiency, comfort and style in a neatly wrapped package.  This Civic offers a much smoother ride and engine than its predecessor.  Even the shifting of the manual transmission is smoother.  It does have an annoying "grinding" sound when downshifting to "1" while the car is rolling.  You have to downshift with the cars rhythm and allow the transmission to accept the gear, but everything else is smooth sailing.  

Changing the headlight bulbs can be a bit troublesome.  There is not a whole lot of space available to get your hand behind the headlight assembly.  Honda offers an alternative which is to access the bulb from the wheel-well.  Also, there is no door lock switch on the passenger door and no trunk release on the keyless entry as there is on the Accord.  

It is spacious for a car in its class, but is nowhere near the most roomy car you can buy.  Although the coupe provides ample room for tall adults in the front, there is not a whole lot of room in the back.  I am 5'10" and I can sit happily without adjusting the front seats, but six-footers may bump their heads on the ceiling.  The moonroof reduces the headroom a bit.  A 2dr Civic, I think, is more of a one or two person car, or for families with small children.  At least, small children who do not need a car seat.  Carseats with the restraining arm that flips "up" will not have enough clearance to insert the child. It can be done, but it is a nuisance.  It is probably most ideal for people between the age of 16 and 30.  Thirty may be optimistic, unless you are just a Civic lover like me.  

The Civic has the ability to look mature since its styling partially mirrors the former Accord coupe.  It is also very similar in interior dimensions.  All of the controls, except the moonroof and the parking brake, are to me, well placed.  The parking brake is slightly awkward; it has been placed on the passenger side of the center console.  Honda has long placed the moonroof control on the dashboard, to the left of the steering wheel.  I think it would work better on the ceiling.  

The Civic also provides excellent visibility. There are very small,if any blind spots. All an all, if you like compact coupes or were a fan of the Accord in the early 90s, this little 'coupon' on wheels will do nicely by you.  Of course, you must keep in mind that it is not going to get you from 0 to 60 in five seconds. However, you won't feel like you are on a riding lawnmower either.  Sure, there are faster cars out there, but Civic doesn't feel like a punishment, unless you been in something a lot faster.  Civic EX has only 127hp, which isn't anything great compared to others, but it isn't far off for the others in its class.  

And, for those of you that like customizing your car for just your own look, there is a plethora of after market accessories available to you.  

I am excited at the next few years I will spend driving my Civic and depending on the changes Honda makes, I may buy the next generation Civic.  Either way, my next car will be another Honda.
