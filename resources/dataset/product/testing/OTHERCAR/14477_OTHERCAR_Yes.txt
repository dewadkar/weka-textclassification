            I bought my Disco slightly used...it had 12K miles on it. So far I've put about 10,000 miles on it myself. It's been fun as heck to drive, though I must admit the most treacherous driving it's ever seen has been the mall parking lot at Christmastime. It's been back to the dealership twice for scheduled service/oil changes. In those visits they have:
1. replaced a seal because of a (small) oil leak
2. tightened a loose driver's seat
3. tightened a rattling back seat (which STILL rattles)
4. fixed a defect (recall) with the ABS system
5. replaced the passenger side seat adjustment knob, which broke
6. replaced the rear brake pads ($200!)
7. cleaned carbon buildup on the exhaust valves
8. changed the oil
Now these things were all covered under warranty (except the oil changes/brake pads) so I can't fret too much. And the customer service has been SUPERB. And they always give me a pretty cool loaner car. But I'm worried about when this car goes off warranty. Like REALLY worried. It's bad enough that I spend $30 a week to keep gas in the thing. I'll be very upset when these little things go wrong and I actually have to pay (a premium) to fix them. So I'm looking into extended warranties at this point. That's how much I love this car. My Atlanta driveway is very steep...yet the Disco breezes up it like it's nothing. And when we get our one snow/ice storm this year, I'll be ready! But seriously, I do love the Disco's 4x4 power and its looks. And I like the sense of odd fascination it draws from other car owners. But if you do a lot of driving (it's a gas guzzler and can get very uncomfortable on road trips), or don't have the time/patience to run it to the dealership every 5k miles for tweaking, this probably isn't the car for you.
