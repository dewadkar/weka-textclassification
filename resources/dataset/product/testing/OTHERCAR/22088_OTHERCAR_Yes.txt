            This camera was purchased in the past few days (April 2000) as a longer term investment.  I'm familiar with digital cameras, having used about four different cameras with my work at an Internet company.  I wanted a camera that would provide sufficient features for several years of home pictures that I would share on the web with my family and friends around the world.  Expecting a baby later this year was also a factor in this decision!

In making the decision for this camera, I was essentially looking for the lowest price entry level camera for web photos at a professional standard.  I compared the DC215 with around four additional digital cameras at lower prices.  In comparison with the cheaper models, the DC215 had certain advantages that would help me achieve what I wanted to achieve (professional standard web photos):

- wide range of settings such as photo quality, picture resolution, exposure
- zoom x2, Close-Up feature
- LCD review/preview screen also allowing for picture modification while still in the camera
- Camera memory card (CompactFlash) which is readily available

Although my computer currently does not have a USB connection, the USB capacity of the DC215 was attractive as its likely to be useful in the near future.

When making the purchase I realised that certain accessories were essential for me and likely to be useful for most users.  The camera I purchased only had alkaline batteries, a 4 MB memory card, and no bag - all of which will restrict my use of this camera.

- an additional memory card (I purchased an additional 32 MB card which was the highest capacity available in the shop),
- AC adaptor to avoid draining batteries,
- 8 NiMH (nickel metal hydrate ... I think!) batteries, four to go in the camera, four in the recharger,
- NiMH battery charger for four batteries,
- camera bag with space for batteries, charger and adaptor.

I've ordered the AC adaptor, batteries and battery charger from the Kodak distributors, and am still to select a bag.

Currently (April 2000) in Australia stocks of this model are being sold as soon as they arrive.  I was able to find it in only two stores in Melbourne - the distributors were out of stock.

So far the family has had fun playing with the camera, especially gazing at the LCD while walking around.  People at work, pets, and local wildlife have all been captured by our camera so far.  This certainly drains the alkaline batteries pretty quickly.  The 32 MB card has a capacity for 500 web photos (good quality, standard resolution).  The camera will probably go into full action once all the accessories arrive.<br><br>
