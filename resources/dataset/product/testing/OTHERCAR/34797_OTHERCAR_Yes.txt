            I have to say that I love my Montero Sport. I live in central Michigan, and even today there is a bias towards domestic vehicles here - there are tons of Olds Bravados and Ford Explorers, but I have one of the only Montero Sports around. Maybe that is one of the reasons I picked this vehicle. My previous truck was a Ford, and before that I had a Pontiac automobile. Personally, I would never choose one of those again. In fact, I want my next automobile to be a Montero Sport!

On the fun side, the Montero puts the &quot;Sport&quot; in Sport Utility. I am more of an urban driver than an off-road driver, so the pick-up and acceleration of the Montero Sport is a real plus to me. This truck can move! The Montero Sport accelerates faster than most cars I have driven, although it does handle a little more roughly. Plus the Montero Sport is simply a good looking truck! It is a lot of fun to drive, and the on-demand 4wd works like a charm when it is needed. 

The interior is comfortable and practical. For the driver, the instruments are not crowded and easy to read. The cruise control, wipers, mirror controls, seat adjustment controls, and CD / radio controls are all within easy reach. The A/C gets very cold, and the heater heats up quickly. In the rear, the split-fold down seats have proved to be very convenient, and there are handy storage compartments in the rear that are quite useful.

On the downside, I get about 20 miles per gallon of gas, which isn't that great. Also, if you are thinking about a Montero Sport, you should really consider crash test results that show the Sport is somewhat vulnerable. When you weigh the results of the crash tests, though, remember that they compare the Sport to larger SUV's such as Land Rovers. Also, I'm reviewing a 2000 Montero Sport, and I understand that older models have some &quot;road rattle&quot; sounds that I haven't experienced. The Sport is more of a mid-size SUV, and if you want a huge, big vehicle to transport a family of 10, it may not be the right SUV for you. But if you want Sport and Utility (meaning fun, and well, work too) in your SUV, then the Montero Sport is a great choice!<br><br>
