            I still have this vehicle; I liked it enough that I put a new engine it in when the other one went.  Now am up to over 180,000 miles. I bought this in 1993 with 1700 miles on it. From the beginning, I was impressed. The visability while driving was amazing. The way this held the road was great and the pick-up was great. I had had smalled cars prior to this, and am very short, so felt like I "owned the road!"  The Mazda people said that the vehicle is actually based on the frame of a smaller car, just higher, making maneuvering into parking spots not a big deal. 

There were some oddities. About 5 years into owning it, the lights would come on while I was at work. The guys in the Engineering Department would tease me about leaving the lights on, but honestly, they were coming on by themselves.
(The vehicle makes a noise if you leave the lights on or if you leave the key in it, etc.)  I can't remember what part Mazda said this was, but it was $150 and I even called Mazda about it because my warrenty had expired 6 months before and they would not do anything about it. They seemed to be aware of the problem though. 

The breaks were replaced on this numerous times, always, at a cost of about $700. That part seems to be the biggest weakness.

When I went looking for a van, I checked into American ones, and Toyota. The Toyota van came with all sorts of bells and whistles had a very large feel to it. I knew I would not be comfortable, especially, when I heard the price. It turned out to have payments about double what the Mazda was. This Mazda cost me about $14,000, and I bought it over the phone, from a dealership in New Hampshire.
