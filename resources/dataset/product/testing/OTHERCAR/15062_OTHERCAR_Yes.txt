            We have found this camera to be very easy to use and convenient. Parents are always asking for pictures of our new baby and now they can see them minutes after they are taken. We bought this camera online and were able to save money as well. This camera is for people who enjoy sending email pictures to family and friends. It works very well for us who know a little bit about technology but aren't the absolute experts. The pictures come out very well on some color printers. We love the camera because it isn't too small or too large. Our 5 year old nephew was taking pictures on Halloween after about a 5 minute lesson. It has also been helpful to sell our house. We were able to give the realtor a disk of pictures to put on her website. <br><br>
