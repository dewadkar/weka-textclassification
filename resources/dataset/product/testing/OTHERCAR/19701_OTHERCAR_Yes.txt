            I have driven my Galant 11,000 miles over the year that I've owned it. The Galant is an incredibly solid car that does everything so well that I rarely have to think about it.  Nothing frustrates me about this car, nothing has broken and it has no glaring shortcomings.  Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.

Walkaround

1998 was the last year for the 3rd generation Galant.  The model series began production as a 1994 model and the front and rear were restyled for 1997.  The overall styling is classic looking.  Not as sporty as the Accord but not as thick as the Camry.  The profile of the car is very smooth while the front and rear look aggressive.  The front bumper has wide, deep air intakes and the front grille slants inward and looks as if its frowning.  The rear of the car is nicely shaped and the whole design works well together.  

Fit and finish of the exterior is excellent.  My particular car has an extremely smooth and even paint job.  The body panels fit well and nothing feels flimsy when I hand-wash the car.  The mid-level ES model includes body colored door handles and rub strips down the doors.  The windows are trimmed with chrome.

Standard on all but the top-of-the-line LS model are 14 inch steel wheels with covers.  This is pretty much standard fare on mid size sedans build in the 90's but I wish Mitsubishi would have chosen 15 inch or larger wheels.  They look somewhat dinky on a car this large.

Interior

The interior of the car is it's strongest point.  The plush seat cloth has been compared to a beige beach towel by my friends but I really like it.  It is thick and has an interesting pattern to it.  The dash panel itself follows the same aggressive theme as the exterior.  The center vents slant toward the driver and the center console houses rotary-style a/c controls and the stereo.  There is glossy wood trim down the center console that looks nice but is obviously plastic.  The shifter for the automatic transmission is a straight lever with the release button on top and an overdrive cancel switch on the side.  It is an interesting design that is not used by many other automakers.  Another interesting feature is the cruise control stalk that works like a turn-signal.  Move the lever up and the car accelerates; push it down and it decelerates; pull it toward you to cancel.  My well-equipped ES model does not have map lights for the front passengers.  Want to pick out a new CD?  You must turn on the big dome light.

The seats in this car are very comfortable overall.  The drivers seat has a knob to adjust height and tilt along with backrest and bottom cushion slide controls.  The passenger seat does not adjust for height.  The backrests are fine but lack adequate lumbar support.  After a few hours they can become a little uncomfortable but it really is a minor issue.  The rear seat, on the other hand, is outstanding.  It is big, plush and has a fold-down armrest.  It is the most comfortable seat in the car.  There is plenty of room back there for 2 guys over 6 feet tall.  

The trunk is adequate but not exceptionally large.  The floor of the trunk is higher than in most cars and creates a shallow area for your stuff.  Still, there is plenty of room for luggage or groceries.  The one-piece seatback folds down for loading longer items and the entire trunk is carpeted to keep stuff from getting scratched.

One minor problem with the Galant is the fit and finish of some interior parts.  The passenger air-bag cover fits poorly on my car and the dash panel has some small lumps in the center around the defroster vents.  The airbags have never deployed so I'm sure that it's a factory defect.

The factory stereo in the car is pretty weak.  A 6 speaker cassette player is standard on all models.  One upside is that it is already pre-wired for a mitsubishi cd-changer for the trunk.  The radio itself does not play stations clearly and does not have the power to produce rich sound.  I replaced my cassette player with a Sony CD/XM radio and left the factory speakers in the car.  The difference was astounding.  The speakers in the car really do have the potential to sound well.  While installing the radio, I had to remove a considerable amount of interior panels and found everything to be securely bolted down.  In many domestic cars I have worked on, the interior panels simply snapped on but in the Mitsubishi, everything seemed build to a higher standard. I was impressed at the careful design and assembly of the interior despite a couple of flaws.

Driving the Galant

In a word. . . Bland.  The Galant is not silent and plush like the Camry nor is it mildly sporty like the Accord.  Rather, the Galant strikes a balance between the two.  The steering is fingertip light at highway speed but still surprisingly accurate.  The car goes around corners well-enough but the tires squeal at modestly quick speeds.  Drive it fast on a mountain road as I do and the car will remain composed and controllable but it is hardly fun to drive.  For a driver's sedan look to the Ford Focus, Contour, VW Jetta and Honda Accord.

On the highway the car is just okay.  In overdrive, the engine turns about 3300 rpm's at 70.  The noise is noticeable but not intrusive to conversation.  The suspension does an adequate job of absorbing bumps but again, it's nothing outstanding.  There is a lack of wind noise though and, despite some shortcomings, we never hesitate to drive the car on longer trips.

The 4 cylinder powerplant found on all Galants is a strong point.  It produces 141 hp and 148 lb. ft. of torque, almost on par with some V6 sedans such as the Contour, base Taurus models and the Mazda 626 V6.  It has noticeably more power than the Toyota Camry, equipped with a 127 HP 2.2 engine.  If you keep the revs above 3,000 rpm's, the Galant will pull steep grades with surprising speed.  The downside to the Galant's large displacement 4 cylinder is its tendency to vibrate at idle.  In traffic, with the A/C on, the engine shakes hard enough to vibrate the dash and steering wheel.  This is not uncommon from front-drive 4 cylinder cars but Toyota's and Honda's do not do this.  The engine in the Galant is high on power but low on refinement.  My Galant averages 28 mpg on premium gas (it's safe to use regular) in mixed driving around the mountains of western NC.  I average 370 miles between fill-ups, better than average in my opinion.

The 4 speed automatic is, again, nothing great.  Shifts are never harsh but are noticeable.  Of interest is the Grade Logic system that was added to 97 and 98 Galants.  The transmission will hold 3rd gear on inclines to prevent unnecessary "hunting" and, if you touch the brakes on downhill stretches, the automatic downshifts into 3rd to provide some extra engine braking.  The system works well and is generally unobtrusive.

Worthy of special mention is this cars ability to go in the snow.  The mountains of NC were pounded with a severe winter this year and I used my Galant to drive to and from class (ASU never cancels classes).  Not once was I stranded.  The car simply plows through snow and slush under complete control.  It astounded me.  I literally zoomed by 4 wheel drive SUV's on my way to class.  Credit new tires and the car's dynamic stability in all conditions.

Reliability

Time for the good part.  Nothing mechanical on the car has failed.  The entire car feels tight and precise.  There is a small rattle at the front of the dash over the harshest bumps and that is it.  At 39,000 miles, a friend pulled the passenger seat belt out past its limit and I had to have the spool replaced.  The local Mitsubishi dealer replaced it under the 36k warranty (shhhh). It took a couple of days for the part to arrive and about an hour to install. Also, there is a very slight brake pulsation at high speeds that might need to be remedied in the future.  For now though, the car is near perfect.  

There has been only one recall for the 98 Galant, which concerned the front ball joints.  Mine had been repaired by the previous owner.

Value

I bought this car for around $8500 from the local Mitsubishi dealer.  It was a one owner car with 32,000 miles on it.  It had never been in an accident according to the CARFAX report(something that I highly recommend). The Galant is a relative bargain when comparing it to the Camry and Accord.  Expect similar mileage used Accords and Camry's to run at least $2,000 higher than the Galant.  

For me, it was the perfect deal.  The car will be going for many years and I doubt that I will part with it before it hits 150,000 miles.  It sure seems as if it will stand the test of time.

Final Thoughts

It took me a long time to decide whether or not I like this car.  It's handsome, unobtrusive, reliable and comfortable for just about anything.  Having said that, there are really no special things about this car.  It is an appliance that will serve me for many years yet it isn't that much fun to drive or to be seen in.  I would recommend this car to anyone who needs reliable transportation with a hint of style.  For those seeking a truly lovable car, I recommend the Accord.  It is more expensive, but, in the end, I believe that you get what you pay for.  The Accord offers more style, drives better and arguably is more reliable.  The icing on the cake is that the Accord has consistently better resale value.  The Toyota Camry is also remarkable in its smoothness.  It is not much of a performance car but it is like driving a budget priced Lexus.  These two benchmark sedans are worth serious consideration and are arguably worth the extra money.

The Galant is a good car that has lots of tough competition from other brands.  It will not disappoint, but be sure to check out the competition before you buy.  If you can swing the extra payments, the precision feel and resale value of an Accord or Camry may just make your time behind the wheel a little more enjoyable.
