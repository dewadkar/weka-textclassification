            This is the best, most portable digital camera available in the $500 range. My Minolta APS camera is now in the drawer next to my 35mm SLR, and this little gem is always in my pocket.

The feel is solid, even heavy, the LCD is bright and clear, and I now have the luxury of playing &quot;Pecker&quot; and shooting anything and everything I see. The small recharger cycles fully in about an hour.

How to make it perfect:  Get SanDisk's 192Mb CF card (about $350), and the S100 can shoot almost 350 1600x1200 images at 72 pixels/inch.  You can increase the resolution for those portraits, or click off 1141 640x480 images at a rate of 2 per second.  (This would be enough capacity to, say, do a complete household inventory.)

Major weakness: the battery which is necessarily small (and almost the same size as a CF card)will get eaten up by the flash and bright viewfinder.  To avoid any downtime, get an extra battery (about $70).

The software is decent, if geared toward the beginner (ZoomBrowser EX and Adobe Photodeluxe) but the driver works fine with PaintShop Pro and CorelDraw. USB only; download speed is about 2 1600x1200 images per second.

And the James Bond angle?  The optics are sharp enough you can set it into macro mode, click an image of a document, then run it through an OCR program and use the camera as a scanner.<br><br>
