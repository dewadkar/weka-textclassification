            I was one of the original owners of the &quot;new&quot; Saturn car when they were first made in 1992.  Driving the Saturn was like being part of a band of road rebels.  Everywhere I stopped for gas, people would ask &quot;What is that?&quot;  Other Saturn owners (rare though they may have been) would honk as they passed and wave, acknowledging the special bond shared by owners of this uniquely new road animal.

While that experience has changed, and Saturn no longer possesses the &quot;special feel&quot; it once had, the company has maintained a place for value, ease of purchase and superior service.  In fact, four years later, I was so pleased with my Saturn experience that I purchased another Saturn.

The Saturn buying experience is a dream.  Car salespeople who are there as a resource, to be helpful, not to sneak one by...imagine that!  Their &quot;no negotiating&quot; stance on pricing is real.  Believe me, I tried.  In the end, this way of offering a fair price up front, without the endless bickering with the sales rep and eventual, ridiculous involvement of the sales manager, truly makes the Saturn buying experience one I wouldn't mind repeating.

I wish I could go on and on about the Saturn driving experience.  The truth, however, is that Saturn makes a good, reliable car.  It drives well and rides well.  It is not outstanding, surpassing all of its peers.  But neither is it worse than any of the leaders in its class.  For someone seeking a good car that handles like a mid-size and rides comfortably, you found it here.

Perhaps my highest recommendation with Saturn is with their people.  Never, by any company selling ANY product, have I been treated so well.  A few years ago, I had to take my car in for service.  It was a routine trip.  When I got done, I wrote a check to the dealer for a few hundred dollars.  A few weeks later, I received a phone call from the dealer stating that, in a routine review, he discovered that I had paid for a service that should have been covered under the warranty.  He then wrote &quot;void&quot; on my check and mailed it back to me!  How many dealers would fess up like that and return money??  I would have never known the difference.

Overall, Saturn is a reliable, dependable car.  The company offers outstanding service and makes purchasing their product a pleasurable experience, rather than one to dread or fear.  I would highly recommend Saturn to anyone.<br><br>
