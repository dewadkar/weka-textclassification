            I purchased a brand new '02 GLE at the end of October 2001.  After driving the car for six months now, I am very pleased with my choice and would recommend the car to anyone.  Here are a few things I have noticed that are worth discussing:

Pros:

This car can outrun just about anything else on the road short of a Corvette or a Porsche.  Seriously.  And it will do it while carrying you, three friends, four golf bags, and four large Cokes to 200 watts of Bose audio in leather-trimmed comfort.

Everything this car does is just SMOOTH.  The doors close with a reassuringly solid "whump" when you get in, the four-speed automatic handles aggressive applications of power without even being noticed, the brakes are strong and linear, and changing lanes comes as easily as though the car was on rails.  One slight downside; even in the GLE, the ride is a bit harsh on rough roads, but the car never rattles or creaks...it feels very solid, but the ride is certainly not soft.  The SE is even worse in this regard, with its tighter suspension.  

The steering wheel-mounted controls are wonderful.  My only gripe is that I wish they were illuminated like all the other buttons.

The dash-mounted CD changer is fabulous.  Don't get the navigation system; you will have to get the trunk-mounted CD.

Interior finish is years ahead of the 2002 Altima.  I test-drove this car before buying the Maxima and found it to be much lower quality.  Years of refining the Maxima definitely shows up here vs. the completely-redesigned Alty.

Cons:

The turning radius of this car is horrible...I'm sure partly a function of it's tall tires and short ride height, but parallel parking or making a U-turn is kind of a pain.  I drove a Sentra for years before getting this car, though, so maybe this is just a characteristic of all large cars that I am not yet used to.

With this much torque going to the front end only, launching from a stop sign is an adventure in three dimensions with the traction control switched off.  The front tires hop up and down and the whole car slews left and right if you really hammer on it in first gear.  This motor would love an AWD configuration i.e. Audi Quattro or Subaru WRX.  Nissan, how about adding the QX4's drivetrain as a $2000 option?  As a New Englander, I would never need anything else in a car.

There are two buttons that are nearly impossible to see or reach from the driver's seat: the traction control on/off and the sideview mirror controls.  The former should be moved to the steering wheel and the latter to a different spot on the dash.

Last minor gripe is with the headlight controls.  The way the controls are set up now is "off", "auto", "parking lights", and then "headlights".  Fog lamps are on a separate switch and will only come on when the headlights are on.  I wish the auto and parking light selections were switched.  Having to go through "auto" to get to the "headlights" selection actually turns the headlights on, then back off as you go through "parking lights", then back on again.  This is annoying and, like a florescent bulb at home, not good for the bulbs to be switched off and on repeatedly. 

Overall Impression:

With the exception of the turning radius issue, all of my complaints about this car are very trivial.  As such, I have no reservations at all about recommending it.  This car is the epitome of the original "4DSC" (4-Door Sports Car) concept of the old-school Maximas.  It handles and performs like the best (and I do mean best...I recently rented a brand new Mustang, which didn't even come close) sports coupes, it has all the interior amenities of the best German sedans, and its reputation for quality and value (check out the resale prices for '97s and '98s sometime) is second only to Toyota in this class.  This car easily equals a GS Lexus, 5-Series Bimmer, or anything from Audi (without all the quirks) for over ten grand less.  Take the leftover money and buy yourself an old half-ton Ford...you'll have the perfect combination of vehicles.
