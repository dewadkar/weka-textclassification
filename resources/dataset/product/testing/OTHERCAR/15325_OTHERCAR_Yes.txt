            I endlessley compared digital camera before I bought this and have owned a old Mavica and use a new Nikon at Work.
Well although on it's best setting (wich makes the 32mb card store 8 pictures) the quaility is WAY better but who has $50 per card to spend on them - so you would use the lower setting to store 30 pictures and then the quality is the SAME as the Mavica - 
The BEST things about this camera vs the others is this - 

MPEG Movie - This feature is a BLAST!
The Rechargable Battery! - Many of them have regular AA Batteries and go through 1 set for about 50 pictures - (Unless your like me and like to see every picture you take in the LCD and then it's like 25 pictures - Even with rechargable what a pain!
The one that comes with the camera lasts about 1 1/2 hours at full use - Playing back all pictures and Movies taken!

Next the zoom - It's way better then the Nikon - 

The Floppy Disks are great! I took 7 disks full one day at Disney and unless you want to spend an extra 500 om Memory Cards you could never do this with others!

Finally  - Who wants to take their computer with them on Vacation - Well if your using Memory Cards you have to be able to download it - (Which by the way is even another 150 for a Firewire Card!)
I just took a bunch of disks - backed them up with the camera (It has a diskcopy option) and had two sets to bring home with no luggin of a computer!!!

Oh - by the way - with the Nikon's you also have to buy a AC Adaptor so that when your transfering to the computer it doens't wear out the batteries! 
And also a USB transfer thing or they transfer at a REALLY SLOW rate!
The Mavica - Stick the disk in ANYONES A Drive and your off!
Not to meniton this Camera could be used by a child! It's that easy!!


Can't say enought good things for a $500 digital camera! We use it to take pictures of everything - from the Family to the Car so when my husband takes it apart he can put it back together!
