            I just recently purchased a used '91 Chevy S-10, extended cab, 2 wheel drive. Althougb I was looking for a 4wd, I must say I'm very pleased with my purchase. The truck has been kept in good condition through two previous owners and runs great. With a one year old son, the extended cab did seem like the way to go, allowing me, my fiancee, and our son all to fit in the truck. However, the car seat must be in the front seat, so any other passengers must take the back. Not a problem, we thought. Well, it turned out the extended cab part of the truck is very, very small and not very roomy at all. Luckily we have another car that works nice, so if we need to go all together we can take the car. But, if we ever need to, we can all squeeze into the truck. As far as driving, it is a standard and shifts really smoothly and the ride is smooth as well. The tires are relatively quiet and the radio works good(always important). I would definatly reccomend this for anyone looking for a nice, dependable truck. Although, if you are looking for a roomy truck, better get a bigger model as even the extended cab of this one is still tight.<br><br>
