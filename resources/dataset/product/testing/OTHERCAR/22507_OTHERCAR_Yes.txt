             We purchased our XL-7 in 2001, and have been very satisfied with it. Problems have been minimal, and our local dealer has really taken care of us.
 The features of this car that are really great are the powertrain- the 175 horsepower engine speaks with authority- and gets between 20-24 mpg. The transmission shifts well, and the anti-lock brakes work well, even in 4wd. Recently, we had some bad weather here, and I had to go out in it in the car to pick up my daughter. this is the reason you buy a car like this- it was sure-footed, solid, and not a bit hard to drive. It shifted into 4wd well, and climbed the steep hill where my daughter was staying with ease. On the way down, it slid- I pushed the brakes and felt the surging that only anti-lock brakes make. the car stopped. It is worth repeating that the anti-lock brakes were not available on the base model- only on the touring and the limited. Spend the extra money. It is worth it. 
 For your money, you will get a car with front and rear heat and air, headlights that come on automatically, fog lights that pierce the night, a rear windshield washer/wiper, a really neat power sunroof- central locking doors, and that third row of seats. The fact is, those third row seats are strictly for kids. There is not enough legroom back there for anyone else. Cargo can fall between the seats and the rear- which is why there is a net supplied. You should also know that the seats are non removeable, more's the pity.
 Overall, I have to say, this car has been a joy to own and drive. I give it an a+.
 Problems? only two- there was a bent bracket which made a humming noise when the car was new- the dealer fixed it quickly- and twice in 18 months it has died while warming up- only to start right back up again. The dealer couldn't find that problem- and its only happened twice- go figure.
