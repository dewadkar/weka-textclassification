            I purchased this camera because it's price was reasonable, and because it contained software for both the Macintosh and PC platforms. I use one platform at home, the other at work. Although I am not an extremely technical person, I was able to use the camera successfully within 5 minutes of pulling it out of the box. The instructions for downloading the camera's pictures to your computer are very clear for both platforms. The software is easy to navigate and pictures are easily converted for jpeg files for use with email and internet browsers. 

This camera would be a good investment for the casual user--someone who wants to explore digital photography, build personal web pages, teenagers, new parents wanting to send baby photos, or to teach someone the basics of doing these things. Because the price is reasonable, and because it is easy to use, this camera would be useful in a school setting. My middle school students use it to record classroom activities and load them into our classroom web page.
