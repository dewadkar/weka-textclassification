            I was going broke paying for all the pictures I took of my three boys.  By the time I got done paying for the film and the developing my pictures, I was spending a small fortune.  To top it off, many times the picture wasn't what I wanted -- either it was out of focus, eyes were closed, etc.  

My grandmother knew I had been wanting a digital camera but being a single mother it wasn't in my budget.  However, while shopping we came across this camera and the price was right ($149.00 on sale) and it seemed to compare well to some of the more expensive models in terms of features.  

Because it seemed to fit all my needs, my grandmother decided to buy it for me as a gift for Christmas.  I have to tell you, it is truly one of the best gifts I have ever received.  It took me about 5 minutes to get it loaded (batteries) and read the initial instructions and I was off taking pictures. I love the ability to be able to see the photo as you take it.  If it's not a good shot, I simply delete it.  

I took some photos of our Christmas celebration and that night I was able to download them onto my computer (about 15 minutes for the entire process reading instructions and hooking things up) and send them off to relatives.  They were very impressed.

There are certainly more expensive camera with more features, but this one is more than adequate for the average family who just wants to be able to save a bit money and share their memories with family and friends.<br><br>
