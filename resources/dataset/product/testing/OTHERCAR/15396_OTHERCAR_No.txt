            I bought this camera to use professionally . I am an artist and needed a camera for quick portrait shoots to use for reference.  very dissapointed in the lack of sharpness. These pictures are fine for e-mail but not for enlarging more than 5X7". Also the pictures seem to depend on exact perfect circumstances to produce a 'good' photo that isn't grainy. I have had this camera for a year and just sold it last week for $300.00. I am going to do more research before buying the next one, especially now that I know what pixals are!However this is a good camera for snapshots that don't require excellence and is fun and easy to use, share and e-mail. Just don't be picky about quality if you buy this camera.
