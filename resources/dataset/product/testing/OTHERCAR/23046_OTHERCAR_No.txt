            The Polaroid PDC 640 is a decent, entry-level digital camera that is extremely easy to use, but has many pitfalls for the consumer.

First, the positive aspects of the camera. Thinking this would be a great way to document the growth of our new daughter, we began to snap away. The camera was beyond simple to acquaint ourselves with, the software was easy to learn and transferring pictures from the camera to the computer was simple.

The options on the accompanying software are easy to use but pretty basic. No frills. You can perform such functions as reduce red-eye, change sharpness, contrast, make the picture look like a sketch, rotate, zoom or crop, plus a few more features. The sketch feature is actually pretty neat-we made a picture into a sketch of our friend holding his newborn son that was very sweet.

The camera stores data on a card which can be removed to print pictures, and you can upgrade the 8mb card which comes with the camera to up to a 64mb card for more photo storage. The card is re-writable as often as you need, as is standard for digital camera cards.

The display screen is a bit fuzzy but a nice feature. It is still clearer to shoot your pictures through the viewfinder rather than while looking at the display, but it is nice to have to weed out pictures you aren't keeping.

Unfortunately, we quickly found that we were without our camera more often than with. First of all, it sucks the juice from batteries faster than a gameboy. We were constantly running out of power right when we needed it.

The camera first went back to Polaroid because the battery compartment door latch broke. They sent us a new camera amazingly enough, but a month later, we sent it back because the display became fuzzy and red, pictures were coming out dark despite the use of the flash, and the power would just cut off even right after putting in new batteries.

We are currently waiting for the camera to be repaired and returned.

Other drawbacks to this camera are the low pixel ratio, making it impossible to blow up a picture larger than 4X6, minimal zoom options so you can't take a really clear picture without being super close, and few menu options.

Really, if you want a camera you aren't constantly having to feed, or are worried about breaking, this is not the camera for you. If you want the option of emailing pictures to people and take infrequent pictures, you may be fine.
