            Even though many people relate to this car as an upscale Ford Taurus, due mainly to it's sharing many mechanical components, and similar interior design, this car is very different and much more than that of the Ford Taurus.  The hood, grill, and lights in the front of the vehicle are very similar to Lincoln division styling, more so than that of Mercury itself. Even the tail lights and the rear styling of the car suggest a Lincoln type appearance. The overall styling, interior/ exterior of the vehicle resembles that of an upscale european sports sedan when opted in select colors/ trim, and to the vehicle's credit, it lacks the high stance, and the "Overblown Look" of most American sports or family sedans from GM and others, but instead, is a very sleek looking sedan with clean/ crisp exterior lines, and has no cheap plastic type circus trim cladding as other brand of vehicles offer. The body is of high quality craftsmanship, all body parts fit properly, and when in operation, you'll hear no unwanted noises, the body is super tight, and the vehicle has a fairly silky smooth ride, handles bumps in the road very well, very little noise from wind can be heard inside the cabin when in motion, and at speeds exceeding 80 MPH.  Opted with the Duratec 3.0 24 Valve V-6 engine, this is all the power that you'll need in a sports sedan, as at 100 MPH, this vehicle just simply wanted to run away from me without breaking a sweat, and the needle on the tac was low, and the engine's power band is very broad in all sorts of driving situations. The Job #2 package that was ordered by dealer, along with standard leather seating, power moon roof, etc., not only looks great with the white instrument gages and wood grain floor console and center dash, but the quality of workmanship, ride comfort and overall looks by far, exceed vehicles such as Toyota Solara, Nissan Altima, and a few others that I had previously test drove prior to my choosing the 2003 Mercury Sable LS sedan, and my declaring it the winner, and the best of the rest.  Sable LS is a lot of "American Bang For The Buck". If you're in the market for a vehicle in this type of catagory, you owe it to yourself to discover what Mercury has to offer, considering 2004 will be the last year for production of the Mercury Sable.
