            I bought my first Toyota 4WD pickup in 1988.  Why?  well, 'cause Honda doesn't make trucks!  I still have that silver 6-cylinder, by the way -- with only 167,000 miles on it, I figure it's good for another 12 years!  Over the past twelve years, I've had to replace the starter, the EGR valve, and the clutch hydraulics -- well, tires and brakes, too, but that's expected, right?  Talk about trouble-free...

When it came time to get a new vehicle to haul around the dog (Nissan does not, CANNOT own the slogan &quot;Dogs love trucks&quot;!) there was never any question that the new truck would be another 4WD six-cylinder manual transmission Toyota.  Imagine my surprise when I found out that they cost twice as much as my '88 did!  But, by golly, it's been worth it!

To be honest, I looked at what the people at Consumer Reports had to say about the vehicle.  They don't think it's as good as a Ford Ranger.  Why?  'cause it doesn't ride like a Cadillac!  [I note below that eopinions.com believes, like CR, that a dead quiet ride is important -- I don't think that's important in a truck.  A limo, yes, but not a truck]  Ever driven a Ranger?  they don't have the power to get out of their own way, and one of those little dogs is lucky to make it to 100,000 miles, much less 200,000.  I drove a Nissan, looked briefly at a Mazda, and then turned right around and went back to the Toyota dealer.  It was all over but the shoutin'.  I opted for an extended cab this time, so Mr Dog can ride in the cab when the weather's too extreme to keep him in the bed (under a cap, of course).

Well, the truck's got just under 30,000 miles on it now, in about sixteen months.  It's sailing along, just like its older brother did twelve years ago, and I suspect that I won't be getting another Toyota truck again until this one has 150000+ on it.  Then my only question is gonna be, &quot;What am I going to do with three trucks?&quot;

What's the upside about my Toyota truck, you ask?  I can sum it up in one phrase: &quot;Quality of design.&quot; To me, that means Toyota puts more time and effort put into making that truck tough and durable than they put into making it pretty and comfortable. As far as I can tell, that's the opposite of the paradigm practiced by the big three American truck makers.  I am confident that when I take that truck out on the open road, into the mountains of Colorado or the Arizona desert that I'm going to get back out without having to get out and push.  Only visit to the shop so far?  The clutch pedal broke a spring -- it was still road-worthy, but every time I released the clutch I heard this ugly groan.  Got it fixed under warranty.

What's the downside of my Toyota truck, you ask?  Well, gee -- the cupholders aren't very convenient, and the jump seats aren't very comfortable.  I guess that goes to show you: I bought this truck to BE a truck, not because it's &quot;cool&quot; to own a truck.  Oh, and I bought it 'cause &quot;dogs love trucks!!!&quot;<br><br>
