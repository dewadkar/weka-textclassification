            I purchased my T100 2 years ago.  I bought it 3 years old and the previous owner had put a 4&quot; body and a 4&quot; suspension lift on, custom wheels and 36ï¿½ Dick Cepek Fun Country tires on.  One look at it on the lot and I was IN LOVE! I refused to leave the dealership without it.  It has a SnugTop, carpet kit in the bed and I installed my previous stereo which now the cab has 14 speakers and the bed has two mounted in the kit.  It has been the best truck I have ever driven and I love to meet other Toyota Lovers!  I paid a pretty penny so I am pretty much always broke between monthly payments and the terrible gas guzzling. (10 miles to the gallon-AHHH) I wouldn't trade it for anything! It goes anywhere and everywhere! LOVE IT!!!<br><br>
