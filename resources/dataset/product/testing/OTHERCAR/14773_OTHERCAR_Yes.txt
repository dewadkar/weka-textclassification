            I would love to have this kind of vehicle but the only problem is that I am real low on cash, and I have no credit behind me either.  But I did take a test drive the Mountaineer is great on the road.  The Mountaineer took the real bumpy road like it was an even road.  And the even roads, man it felt like you are driving on a cloud. The ride was so smooth I fell in love like I need that SUV.  And now the inside man, I could live in it.  Real roomy in the back and front.  You have so much room you don't have to worry if you are going to hit someone next to you.  But the only problem is that I was low on the money part.  I just hope I will be able to get that vehicle soon.  Like I said before is the only con I have with this is the bill.  Too rich for my blood. I would recommend this to any and every one who has the money for it. <br><br>
