            I have owned many cars over the years, from the small compact to the 

large luxury cars.  I have to say, my 1996 Chevrolet Beretta is the best 

this far.  I bought it nearly three years go, used, from a Chevrolet 

dealer.  At this time it had about 32000 miles on it.  I have since 

driven it from Texas to Wisconsin, back to Texas and then back to 

Wisconsin, From Wisconsin to California and back, and from Wisconsin to 

Michigan several times.  I have never had a bit of trouble with this car, 

unlike some I have owned in the past.  As far as repair work, I have 

replaced the tired and break pads once.  

My reason for voicing my opinion is that as I said I have owned several 

cars, and this one has been the most dependable yet.  I would not 

hesitate to get in the car and drive it anywhere.  It is considered a

smaller car, but It has enough room for two teenage boys and all their 

stuff, so it works out good for me.  Large trunk space, and a comfortable 

amount of space inside as well.  All the traveling I have done in this 

car has been with both my children.<br><br>
