            I just recently bought my 1996 Pontiac Grand AM SE.  I think the overall design of the car is nice.  The standard equipment is great for a car in its class.  I bought this Grand AM a little less than a month ago.  

This is my first car it was a gift to myself on my 18th birthday, 
and it has surely made me a more responsible person.  By that I mean that it has taught me to spend money on things I really need, and save the rest of my money for repairs.  

Since I have had my car, I have had the brake pads changed, the rotors resurfaced (in about another month or so they will need to be replaced), the serpantine belt changed, the oil sensor unit replaced, the fuel filter changed, oh, and the check engine light came on, and the ETS light would not go off.  I took it in to the dealer, and they told me that some kind of $1 dollar hose caused the check engine light to come on.  

Well that $1 dollar hose that made the check engine light come on cost me $81 dollars to have replaced.  One dollar for the hose and $80 dollars for the labor.  That is not the end.....today I started my car and drove to work as normal, and parked it in my normal spot, as usual, and about 2 hours later, a co-worker of mines told me that my car was leaking green fluid.  

Already I know what this is, now I want to get outside to see where the anti-freeze is leaking from.  I checked the car out, and it was leaking from the center (bottom) of the car, for in my mind I am thinking it is my water pump.  I check the over float box and I noticed that when I took it to the dealer they must have called themselves doing me a favor, and topping off everything, well they over filled the box, and I HOPE that is what caused the leaking.  

I moved my car to a new parking space, and left it there for the remainder of the day (six hours), and when it was time to go home, I noticed there was nothing leaking.  No new wet anti-freeze spots or anything.  The over float container was right at the full line, no more extras in there.  I drove the car for about 40 miles after I left work, hoping that IF it was really the water pump that the car would go ahead and over heat or start dripping again.  

Well nothing leaked.  So I am hoping that the over fill by the dealer was the reason for the leaking.  I can already tell that there are more problems to come with this car.  Every time I get in it I get a strange feeling that it is going to leave me stranded somewhere.  Keep in mind I am 18, no credit, and no cell phone because they want $500 deposit due to no credit.  So wherever the grand am leaves me, that is where I will be.  

With all the problems, I do think the grand am is a fairly nice car, just this one is a troubled one.  I am hoping that this is just the one bad apple in the entire bunch because as I write I am saving money for a new Grand AM GT Sedan, hoping this one will last another 30K miles without too much of a problem.  I would recommend a Grand AM to anyone buying it NEW, that way you know that has been no rough treatment or driving done to the car.  I think most of my problems come from the previous owner not taking good care of the car.  I have spent more than I planed on this car, already, but I am going to give GM/Pontiac another try....I am going to get another Grand AM...a new one!<br><br>
