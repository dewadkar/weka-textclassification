            My girlfriend is looking for a car to replace her aging 1991 Mercury Tracer. We have already seen the Chevrolet Impala, Chrysler Cirrus, Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. Last night we took a test drive of a 1998 Acura 2.5 TL sedan.

We were looking at a 1998 Nissan Maxima and then walked a few paces and saw a line of Acura sedans. A friend of mine once owned a 1988 Legend and another friend has a 1999 3.5 RL sedan. Acuras are rather attractive cars with a prestigious nameplate and 'legendary' reliability. I find Acura's new alpha-numeric nomenclatures rather confusing. I think the old Legend, Vigor and current Integra names are more pleasant.  

Anyway, the car we looked at was a 1998 Acura 2.5 TL sedan, the successor to the old Vigor. The 'TL' stands for 'Touring Luxury' and 2.5 refers to the unusual 2.5 litre in-line five cylinder sedan. I think the only other car I've seen with a five cylinder engine was a Volvo. The car had a teal or wedgewood blue finish with a dark blue leather interior. The car also had cast aluminum wheels and sunroof. The car had a lot of nice amenities such as access to the trunk via a back seat 'pass-through' for long, thin cargo and factory anti-theft system. it also had a combination CD/Cassette AM/FM stereo with Bose sound system.

It also featured an unusual &quot;gated automatic&quot; with gears designated as D4, D3, D2 - D4 used for normal driving conditions. One pushes down on the selector lever to change gears. I was pretty comfortable sitting in this car despite it being a quite bit smaller than my Cadillac Deville and myself being a bigger, taller person. The dashboard was pleasant to look at, although I was disappointed that the wood trim was only simulated. I liked thoughtful touches as the gearshift selector display on both the floor console and dashboard not to mention the twist knob to control the HVAC temperature. My Cadillac uses a switch that must be pressed each time to raise or lower the interior temperature by 1 degree. I felt the Acura's control was more convenient. 

Some things I didn't like was the confusing radio controls. I couldn't figure out how to change stations and wasn't able to locate the &quot;SEEK/SCAN&quot; buttons. The other buttons were also rather teeny and hard to see. The 2.5 engine had adequate power, but I felt as if I had to press down a little hard on the gas pedal to get any acceleration. I understand that Acura also offers a 3.2 litre V-6 for this sedan that offers better acceleration. 

All and all the Acura 2.5 TL is a very attractive, solidly built vehicle with a good reputation. My girlfriend seemed to like the car and it can be had used for a fairly moderate price. Our experience with the dealership was pleasant and the salesman was very accommodating. I understand a new 2000 model can be purchased for about $28,000.

To summarize the Acura TL sedan is a great near-luxury car with a modest price, but I'd opt for the more powerful 3.2 litre V-6
