            I purchased my Dodge 2500 with the Cummins Turbo Diesel nearly a year ago to meet the towing demands of my Roofing business.  It has more than lived up to my expectations.  
  To begin with, I would have never expected a 3/4 ton, 4x4, extended cab pickup with a full eight foot bed to get the fuel mileage that I get.  I average 17 in town, and 19-20 mpg on the highway.  I have always been used to 14-15mpg on a 1500 series 4x2 pickup, so this was a pleasant surprise.
  Secondly, the towing ability of this vehicle is phenomenal.  When going down the highway with a load, you literally cannot tell that there is anything behind you.
  Thirdly, the  comfort of the interior is second to none.  I have owned a new Ford and Chevy, and the comfort of the Dodge interior is far superior.  My family and I found it so comfortable that this summer we took it on our 2500 mile vacation trip to Yellowstone instead of driving our Explorer.
  The only drawback that I have seen to this vehicle is that it is so long that it is sometimes difficult to find a parking space, but in our area this is usually not too much of a problem.
  If you are looking for a tough, hard working towing machine, this truck is for you.<br><br>
