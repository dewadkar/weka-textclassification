            We owned an older Plymouth Voyager, but when we discovered we were expecting our third child we decided maybe that second sliding door would be a good thing.  We started looking at new minivans comparing prices, options and just seeing what was around.  We found that the best value would be to go for a &quot;leftover&quot; 1999.  

We discovered many other minivan with options that were nice, but nothing came close to the value for the money that this 1999 Plymouth Grand Voyager offered us.  We don't have lots of extras, but when you've got three little kids, who needs leather seats??  We do have airconditioning, tinted windows (which help with the glare), and a roof rack (which is a nice feature when you need to transport something large).  

The seats remove easily and the third (three passenger) seat can be put in the second slot to allow the van to carry 5 people while giving extra cargo space.  Having the two side doors makes it so much easier for me to get my three kids into their carseats without doing acrobatics.  

The controls on the console are all easily reachable for the driver or front passenger.  The one problem that I have is storage space for cassette tapes and such.  There is one small bin and a slot, but these fill quickly and things fall out often. We have owned this van for a year now and have had no mechanical problems at all.  It starts reliably (even on those cold winter mornings) and goes when I need it to.

This van allows our family of five (three in carseats) plenty of room and still hold the double stroller and groceries or shopping bags.  I would highly recommend a Plymouth Voyager to anyone in the market for a minivan.<br><br>
