            I have to say that this is one of the best cars that I have ever driven.  The ride is smooth and the handling is superb.  Honda definately has made a lot of improvements on this car and has refined it wonderfully.  Bear in mind I am not the owner of this car.  A close friend of mine lets me drive their car very often and each time it gets better and better.  There are two engine options, the 4 cylinder with 150 horsepower and the 6 cylinder which has 200 horsepower.  If you like power go with the V6 but bear in mind that its about two thousand dollars more for only 50 HP.  Even so, the 4 cylinder, even though it doesn't have a lot of HP it has fast pickup.  You find yourself at 40 MPH before you even know it.  

The seats could use a little more room for the legs but for a short person it would be sufficient.  They also could have been a little more soft but that is minor.  The breaking was very good and the gas mileage was decent.  I honestly do not have any complaints about this car.  It has not been to the shop yet except for normal maintenance like oil changes etc.  The instrument panel is rather boring and simple but at least their sound system is actually decent for a factory speaker.

With the exception of the seats not being comfortable for long road trips adn the fact that I really did not like the instrument panels appearance I would still say that this is an excellent car.  The price is a little high but the car is worth every penny spent on it.  It's an attractive, well built and refined, solid car and I think could last easily over one hundred thousand miles.  

My only real gripe with Honda is their option packages and that if I want a moonroof I have to get a fully loaded Accord just to have it.  I think that's ridiculous and not only will I have to pay too much money (of which I don't have) I end up getting things on the car that I don't want.  <br><br>
