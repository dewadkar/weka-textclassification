            I have a white 1992 Acura Integra GS-R.  I purchased this car new from Acura in '92 with 8 miles on the odometer.  This is the 1.8L 4-cylinder V-TEC engine that produced 150HP, but now has lost about 10 ponies or so.  Out of the 175,000 miles, I'd say about 130,000 are highway miles, which probably accounts for the clutch still being the ORIGINAL.  Yes, you read correct, I have never changed the clutch on this car and it's still running fine.  I'm not saying the Integra's clutch will never wear out or that it will last 100,000 without a change because a typical clutch should only last maybe 40,000 miles tops, but we're not talking about your typical car.

This car handles remarkably well around corners and is quite stable.  It shares the same underbody as a Civic (I have a 1995 Civic LX also) but handles easily twice as well.  The clutch throw is short so it makes for very quick shifts and a lot of excitement.  The clutch is heavier than the later Integras and current RSX, but they're still very light compared to comparible year German or American cars.

The tires are on 14" rims, which makes the car look not as aggressive.  I would have preferred 15" or 16", but the 14" have done their job well.  I current have Yokohama tires on and they run slightly better than the original Michelins.  Wear is a respectable 40,000 or so for both brands.

The only interior available was cloth, which I preferred anyway, because who wants to sit on dead cow skin all day.  The 1992 interior seemed to be made with higher quality material than the later year Integras, but that's only my Epinion.  You don't see the flash around edges on the hard plastic parts that you see on the third generation Integras.  Airbags were not available, only automatic belts, which leads to grip #1 later.  The radio was an AM/FM cassette, which I never upgraded in it's 10 years.  The radio and power antenna both still work.  The positioning of the radio is grip #2 later.

The brakes are excellent.  Because it's a manual, you use the brakes less than an automatic, so they last longer.  Most of the miles are highway, so my brakes are actually the originals also.  They fade slightly after about three successive hard stops (not that I've had to do that, I just tried it once on the highway at night when I was alone).  with regular driving, the brakes stop the car fast and straight. 

My maintenance record has been pretty much by the book.  I change the motor oil every 3,000 with Mobil 1 synthetic and I've always used Honda original filters.  The timing belt was changed at around 70,000, 130,000 and now recently.  I'm sure they both could have gone well beyond when I changed them, but I don't like playing around with timing belt wear.

All still originals on this car:

Engine (no work done, just gaskets recently)
Transmission (no work done, including clutch)
All four struts are original and still absorbing shock fine.
Muffler system
Major engine components (radiator, distributor, oil pumps, oxygen sensors, etc.)
Air conditioning (never serviced in 10 years)
All interior and exterior panels, buttons, etc.

Recently, it finally had a 'major' problem.  It blew an oil gasket and was leaving oil stains on my garage floor.  It could have survived by just adding oil as I go, but my gray garage floor would have been black in a month.  I brought the car to my local Acura/Honda Specialist Garage (not dealer) who has always serviced my car and believe me, he hasn't made much from me.  I've only been to him two or three times prior to this and it was mostly for timing belt changes only.  This guy use to work for an Acura dealer so he does maintenance pretty much according to dealers.

I had ALL gaskets on the engine changed, the timing belt (with pullies) and water pump (for preventive reasons) changed, along with oil/filter, and radiator fluid, for $900.  Figuring I've easily got another 50,000 to 100,000 left on this car, that's was a good investment for me.

Only two grips with the ergonomics and that's the electric belts and radio placement.  I always wear my seatbelts, but I would definitely have preferred airbags.  The sliding belts are just a PITA (pain in the as-).  The radio is much too low on the dashboard because you can't reach it without bending down a little.  Plus, the radio search lever is just below the volume control, so with the combination of leaning over and turning, you sometimes hit the lever by mistake and end up changing the station.

Underneath when I rate Quality and Craftsmanship, I put down a 4, but this should actually be broken by Epinion into two topics.  They're mixing craftsmanship of the vehicle with quality of ride comfort.  For the craftmanship of the vehicle, I'd have to say a 5 (10 of 10), but the ride is sort of hard with the sport suspension and it is sort of loud because of the road noise and engine revs.  Quiteness, definitely 4 (7 of 10).

If you read my 1995 Honda Civic LX review, you'll see that these Honda's just run and run and run forever.  You'll be sick and tired of owning one for over 10 years and getting a new one, before they break down causing you to have to buy a new one.  I haven't gotten sick of my babies yet because they're doing what they've always done, but if I do get sick of them one day, I'll just replace them with new ones.
