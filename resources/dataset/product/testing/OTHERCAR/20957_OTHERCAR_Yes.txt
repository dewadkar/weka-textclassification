            For this vehicle, I may have to break a few rules!
  
Rule # 1 - When a new vehicle comes out, I won't buy it the first year of production, giving them time to work out all of the 'kinks'.

Well, Rules were made to be broken!  This is one Retro-looking automobile, and at first glance, I had decided that I must have one.  On top of that, Chrysler keeps teasing us, allowing only brief glimpses of it, here and there.  This only serves to wet the appetite.  
(Smart move, Chrysler!)

After some searching, I came across the spec-sheet for this new dynamo.  It's only a 4-cylinder.  Also, It's not as big as it appears, on television.

The interior is very functional, and depending on which package you go with, you can have different configurations of options.  The rear seat folds down, to provide a cargo bay, of sorts.  One package provides a front passenger seat that folds down, also.  
(Necessary, in a vehicle that's roughly the same size as a Dodge Neon.)

All in all, it's still one sharp looking little, retro panel-truck, vaguely reminiscent of an old woody.  

It is front-wheel drive and is rumored to be all-wheel-drive, it's second year in production.  

Guess I won't be breaking my rules, anytime soon, unless there's an added option for a 6-cylinder.

Then again, a girl has a right to change her mind, doesn't she?!

With a projected sticker price starting in the $16,700.00 range and topping out in the $20,000.00 range (depending on which of the 3 packages you choose), maybe this little eye-catcher is worth a closer look.
