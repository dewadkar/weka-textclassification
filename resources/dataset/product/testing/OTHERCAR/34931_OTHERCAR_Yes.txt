            I just love my 1989 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. It is the most reliable car I ever bought.!! I have never been stranded! (my car has 148,529 miles on it!!!!!)This car has great gas mileage,does NOT burn oil. I check my oil once a week,and I have been good with oil for 2 months at a time!! Very true!! I purchased my car at an auto auction,and I definately would not give this car up for anything.The only bad point I have about this car is that the door handles broke off the outside of both doors...just snapped off!!!And the power doors ,the windows broke(the part that sends window up and down) Besides that,I would recommend anyone buying a new or used car to check out this car!! You will NEVER be disappointed!! I love my Olds!!!<br><br>
