            Three weeks ago, I bought a 2000 Acura 3.2TL. Though the 92-octane gas gets to be a little expensive, the mileage on this car is so great, that I hardly notice. I got the one with the GPS built in, and I never get lost. I crack up whenever I hear it say &quot;quick turn ahead&quot;, because the programming on the voice is such that it does not manage to say it perfectly.
	The car handles wonderfully. The acceleration is so smooth that I got to 80, and without looking at my speedometer, thought I was going too slow on the highway. The suspension is good enough that when the road surface gets rough, you can barely feel it. The anti-lock brakes are so good you can stop on a dime. The car is aerodynamic, and there is very little wind-noise when you drive. The sportshift, a &quot;Manual Override&quot; for the automatic transmission, is wonderfully smooth, and almost gives you the same feel that you have with manual transmission. However, you almost never use it because the normal automatic transmission is so smooth that it is hard to feel the difference.
	In short, this is a wonderful car, for anyone willing to spend the $30,000 dollars to buy it, and the only problem with it, is that you love it so much, if it gets dinged, you break into a crying fit, about the poor car, that with the purr of the engine, seems to be as alive as your family cat.
