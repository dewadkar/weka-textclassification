            Ok, so this about my mom's car (I just purchased a new Beetle). But we have been so satisfied with both that I think I can offer an objective opinion about the cabrio to anyone thinking about getting one.
   First, all the VW's are great. They all come with great features and the customer service is excellent.  The cabrio is very sporty and my mom (and I ) have been very happy with it. Everything in it is easy to use. The top goes down easily and, like all VW's, the extra features are great.
   The cabrio rides beautifully. It hugs the road despite it's small size and is great in the city. It is a lot roomier inside than I expected and with my mom and I being a little on the short side (we are both barely five feet tall) we had great visibility. The only thing about the visibility is that there is a little blind sopt because of the smaller rear window.
   However, my stepfather (who is over 6 feet tall) says that he can also comfortably drive the car. The seats adjust great for any size. The engine is also great. There is quite a bit of pick up to this little car and gas mileage has been sufficient so far. For a manual transmission, the ride is much smoother than I thought....in fact, this is the smoothest manual transmission I have ever driven and my mom concurs. 
    VW offers some great extended waranties and my mom was very happy that she got one. She has not had to use it, but for the price it is a great peace of mind. After she bought the car, we met someone who has had a cabrio since 1981. He says that he bought the car new and it still runs great with over 200,000 miles on it! I think there is a reason we are seeing so many VW's on the road....
