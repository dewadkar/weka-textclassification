            I am writing this opinion on the Silverado 1500 because my dad bought one about 3 months ago. This is a very nice truck, it's well equipped for the price. There is not enough weight in the  rear end though with a gust of wind the rear end likes to sway. When the rear sways it is hard to regain control if you are not very prepared for the situation. My sister has proven this point when she totaled the pick-up yesterday. But even though the swaying caused her to wreck the overall sturdiness is the reason her and her daughter came out with only a few cuts and bruises while the truck was totaled. In a crash situation the Silverado 1500 held up to keep the passengers of the  single vehicle accident safe. I would recommend this truck for light duty and personal use driving.<br><br>
