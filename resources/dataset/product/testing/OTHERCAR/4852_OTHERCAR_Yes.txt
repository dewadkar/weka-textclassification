            I have always fancied having a crack at using an SLR, but the costs and hassle factor involved in film and developing put me off, especially as I would no doubt be developing rubbish for ages before I started to understand what made a 'good' photos.

The DSLR is the perfect answer as I can now take half a dozen pics in no time, and review them all.  Already (I have had the camera for a couple of days) I have taught myself (with the help of several excellent tutorial website) what all the functions of the camera do, and how they affect the final images.  

I purchased a Sony DSC-V1 just before my first baby was born 5 months ago, and I used it like mad.  It is a great camera, but compared to my 300d it now feels really lacking.  The thing I notice most is the speed with which the camera is ready to take another shot.  With my Sony it takes maybe 5 seconds to be ready to take a second shot.  I assume the time is taken writing to the memory stick, but I am not sure.  

With the 300d I can take maybe 8 photos in 5 seconds.  I wouldn't have credited what a difference this makes, but it really is amazing.  Where before I would get one or two photos of one of my sons laughing fits, now I get a dozen, and then I can simply select the best shots.

When the camera arrives it does not come with a memory card which seems a little cheap of canon when supplying a �850 camera.  I had been advised to get the fastest card rather than the largest, and as such I got a 40x Compact flash which works very well.  It still takes a while to download them to my computer, so I would recommend the same to everyone.  Get a fast card;  When I was buying mine there were 4x and 12x cards available with greater capacity, but they will drive you mad when you download your pictures.

I would also advise at least a basic understanding of how an SLR works.  I had been reading up for a couple of months before I got my 300d, and I am glad of it now.  The camera has many 'Automatic' functions where the it decides all of the settings for you.  But given even my pretty limited knowledge I still managed to get much better photos in full manual mode.  It is a little confusing at first, but give it a while surfing the web and you will be adjusting your shutter speeds and aperture in no time!

The image quality is also quite fantastic.  With my Sony there was always a noticable darkening around the edges of prints, but there is none of that with the 300d, it is razer sharp across the whole frame.  

There has been much debate that I have read regarding the EF-S lens that accompanies the camera if you select the lens kit.  A lot of people knock it as being cheap and nasty with a "plastic mount" and "poor quality optics".  Whatever!?!  This is a great beginners lens IMHO.  If you look at the cost of Canon lenses, this one is a bit of a bargain at sub �100, and it gets you off the mark.  So far as poor quality optics go - I think the pictures I have got so far are excellent. 

I am no professional photographer, and have little intention to become one.  For me the 300d is simply the natural progression from the top of the range point and shoot cameras.  And WOW is it ever a progression!
