            I have this camera only for a few weeks now, but I can already say it is a great camera!  It makes very great pics!  I received the prints I ordered via the included AgfaNet Print Service (11x15cm and 15x20cm format) and they really look great!)  The camera itself is very easy to use.  You can change resolution, flash and selftimer with a touch of the button, and the advanced menu is very clear and user friendly.  The LCD screen is very handy to preview or review your pictures or video-clips.

The included software is very complete and user friendly.  When you connect the camera to your computer a program pops up showing thumbnails of all pictures you have taken.  You can save them on your disk, or open/edit them in other programs.

I also have tried using the camera as a webcam, and also this gave great results.

The only thing I recommend when you have this camera, is to get an optional CF-card.  The internal memory is rather limited... I use a 16MB CF-card and it can store 53 pictures in the highest resolution. (over 400 in low res.!)

So, all I can say is that I'm very happy with this Agfa camera... I would certainly recommend it to anyone!!  If you plan to buy an "affordable" and decent digital camera, you should certainly check this one out!
