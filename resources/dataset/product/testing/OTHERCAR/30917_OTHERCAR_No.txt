            I was living in Arizona at the time and driving a Jeep.  I absolutely loved the little topless toy, but I use my vehicle for business and the Jeep just wasn't cutting it.  I wanted a convertible that had some room inside, most are 2 seaters or have back seats that don't really count.  I found the Sebring and fell in love with it.  About 2 weeks later the reality set in.  

I owned my 1996 Sebring for just under 2 years, in that period of time I had received between 5 and 10 recall notices, laid out more than $5,000 for repairs not covered under warranty and only drove about 50,000.  The car spent an average of 2-4 days per month in the shop.  I endured things like the A/C going out after less than 1 year (sidebar here:  this may not sound like much to you, but if you ever lived through a 120 degree, Arizona summer....it means a lot.  driving to work without A/C in Arizona is equal to preheating your oven to 120 degrees and shoving your head in it for 45 minutes).  It took Chrysler several weeks to get the back ordered part and 3 days for labor.  I had sensors go out for no reason, the top decided to stay down one rainy day.  However, it wasn't all bad, I mean I made friends with the entire service department, they had some interesting nicknames for me I'm sure.

Bottom-line:  It was nice going topless, but unfortunately my wallet wasn't bottomless.
