            The new Jeep Cherokee is a great family car. It has tons of room, and is extremely comfertable. It is beautiful to look at, and isn't too fancy. For being only 15 years old, I am very in tune with cars.

If you want a SUV that is music to your ears, and soft to the touch, this is the one you want to get. Jeep makes their cars very reliable, and believe me you can't get more reliable then this. 

The stylish interior, and exterior makes you feel proud to be riding in it. And with enough room for the whole family and then some, the Jeep Cherokee makes road trips a breeze. 

Most people think SUV's are monsters, they are so big, and would be hard to handle. Unfortuantly they are WRONG, and have no clue what they are missing. The Cherokee isn't one of the biggest SUV's, and definately not one of the smallest. They are good in the rain as well as the snow. They drive very smooth, and don't feel any different from driving any other vehicle. It is great because your higher then most cars, and it is easer to drive when your up higher. 

I recommend this to anyone who wants a affordable, comfertable, and stylish SUV. GO OUT AND EXPERIENCE LIFE WITH THE JEEP CHEROKEE!

(NOTE TO ALL CONSUMERS: Some people feel when it is snowing heavy, or very icy out that just becuase they are in a SUV they can get through it, not slow down and be cautious like everyone else, well that is very un-true. Just because your driving a bigger car, that can handle different, tough terraines, doesn't mean your super hero! )<br><br>
