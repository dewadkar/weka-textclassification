            I bought this camera in August, a few weeks before my brother's wedding so that I could practice with it for the wedding. I also bought a 128Mb SD card since the 8Mb card that came with the camera was clearly not enough.  I also bought two set of rechargeable NiMH batteries since I knew that digital cameras required a lot of energy. Until now, I have taken over 500 pictures with the camera, in differant circumstances.

Although the camera has a lot of manual features, I just ignored them and started using the automatic modes right away.  I took me about 5 minutes to figure out how to use it. It's simply that easy. Downloading the photos onto my PC running on Windows XP was a cinch: plug in, turn the camera's download mode on, and the rest will follow. A small problem: the flexible plastic cap of the PC or TV cable slot tends to get in the way, but it's no big deal. 

The pictures taken were of excellent quality; however, under very sunny conditions the blue colour did not always turn out correctly. Nevertheless, compared to three other digital cameras that I have used, the pictures of the PDR were way better.  At the wedding, at night, the pictures turned out very nice and the depth of field was very clear.  But in very low light situations, when I pushed the shutter quickly, the pictures were blurred: I still have to get used to the fact that with digital cameras, the shutter should be pushed in two stages.  Every time when I pushed the shutter in two stages, the picture quality were very good or excellent. I compared my pictures of the wedding with those taken by a friend of mine with a more prestigious brand name 3.2 MP camera: my pictures won the race hands down, especially in the depth of the field. The red-eye reduction did not work in some circumstances and I had to correct the pictures using a photo software.  The ACD See software that came with the camera is very basic.  There are three quality modes for picture taking.  I have always taken pictures with the best or second best quality modes. 

I have not used the manual features and cannot comment about them. The video feature is nowhere comparable to my camcorder and there is no sound, but I did not buy this camera to take video. Another feature that I am still not used to is the lens cover: it has to be manually open after turning the camera on; something that I forgot from time to time and got reminded when looking at the viewfinder or the small screen in the back. By the way, the screen can be dimmed or turned off to save batteries.  I often turned it off since I worked quite well with the viewfinder.  The camera also came with a remote control, which is probably unique in this price range.

About the batteries, I started using the rechargeable right away and these last a long time between charges, but I cannot say whether it's the batteries or the camera.
 
My wife had always been sceptical about digital cameras but the pictures taken with the Toshiba have won her over.  My problem now is that she wants to print many of them out.  I just hope that she does not push for a photo printer.
