            I don't drive big cars, unless the rental agency upgrades me 'cause they don't have anything left in the size I reserved.  I feel like those behemoth tanks (take that, Suburban and Excursion drivers!) are a waste of resources, particularly when I know darn well that there will only be one person in there for the whole trip.

So, I reluctantly accepted the Buick LeSabre this time, mostly because my other choice was a Geo Metro or something like that.  Hey, there is such a thing as <i>too</i> small!  I mean the last time I drove a vehicle this big, it was painted orange and white and had &quot;U-Haul&quot; emblazoned on its side!  But after five days and five hundred miles in that LeSabre, I began to wonder if driving one of these big Buicks is a conditioned response triggered by reaching the age of fifty.  Since I passed that milestone myself three months ago, I started to think that maybe I was now ready for enshrinement in my own big ol' Buick tuna boat.  Luckily, when I dropped off the LeSabre, I shook off the feeling almost as soon as I climbed back in my battered 1988 Toyota pickup (168000 miles and going strong!) to drive home.

Imagine this from a devout small-car driver: I was impressed by the comfort and ride of the LeSabre!  Its smooth ride is offset by a feel of the road that compares favorably with many smaller cars.  In my experience, this often isn't the case: usually a smooth ride means that the car corners like the Queen Mary!  But the LeSabre held the road well, cornered responsively, and still managed to iron out the bumps with class.  And I still got an average of 25.4 mpg on the trip, very good for a car this size.

OK, now for my notes:  The LeSabre is, to put it gently, kind of ugly -- it's built along the styling of those police cruisers I call the Buick RoachMaster, with melted-looking fenders and a slightly beetle-shaped fuselage.  If I were in the market for a car this size, I'd be disinclined to buy the Buick because I think there are more attractive cars out there.  The trunk is roomy (again with the stupid compact spare!), although mine was perennially wet -- the rental agent thought there might be a bad weatherstripping job.  The driver's seat is comfortable and highly adjustable, although the lumbar support doesn't seem very assertive (us old fogies have bad backs, you know!).  I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out the codes on the climate control -- Houston had a cold snap and I didn't need the A/C, but I couldn't figure out how to get slightly warm air circulating at upper-body level.  I thought that the wood-grained plastic panel along the dashboard was way too phony-looking, and the pillars at the sides of the windshield are designed way too wide and too far forward for my tastes in visibility.

Boys being boys, I was fascinated by the array of push-buttons for controlling the instrument panel display.  I was probably every bit as dangerous as the average cell phon-atic as I tooled along punching back and forth among fuel economy, odometer, gage readings, and an English-Metric speedometer toggle!

I liked the car.  I won't buy one, because I'll never need that much room and I just (still) don't like big cars.  But if <b>you</b> prefer the big ones, I think you ought to take a look at the LeSabre.
