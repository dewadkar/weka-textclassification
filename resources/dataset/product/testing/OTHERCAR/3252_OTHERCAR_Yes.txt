            I have a 1995 Chevy Tahoe and I love it. It is very hard on the gas gauge but rides great handles very well and is extremely comfortable. I have 3 children ages 9, 8 and 3 and only have the 2 door model and there is still plenty of room for both older kids and the younger child's car seat. We have gone on long road trips and it was great. There is plenty of room in the back for everyone's belongings, tons of leg room, and plenty of head room. The only thing I could never figure out is why is there 8 cup holders when the truck only seats five people?
