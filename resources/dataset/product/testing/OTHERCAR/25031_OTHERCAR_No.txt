            I own a 1990 Voyager with the V-6 3.0 with A/C. I can tell you that it is a sound running van untill it hits about 120,000 miles.  At this point from what i have found out from my mechanic and others u can almost count on there beeing problems with the transmission. The only other problem that i have found with the van is that the cam seals also start to leak oil somewhere around the same time(i think that this may be a fluke though) The last problem that i have is with the window cranks.  after some time the PLASTIC gears inside the door seem to just let go.  This leaves you with no way to put your window up or down without bringing it in to have it fixed.  I was told it would cost me $50/door(ofcourse shortly after one of them broke in the up position the other did soon after.)   <br><br>
