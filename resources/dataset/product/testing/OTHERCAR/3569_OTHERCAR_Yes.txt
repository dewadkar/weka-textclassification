              While I could never be called a camera buff, new technologies fascinate me. I guess we are pretty typical in that we've always had one camera or another to record our families memories. I had seen various digital cameras at family reunions, weddings and other gatherings from time to time. Whenever a camera enthusiast would try to explain his or her latest wonder to me, the techno babble would sent me deep into MEGO*-land. However once a comment did manage to penetrate my blank stare. The Canon Powershot could be used as a regular camera, I was told. Then, when you are ready you can master the advanced features..

   <i> EUREKA. </i> Sure enough the camera was Grandpa friendly and I was able to use it successfully the first weekend we tried it out. A trip to the scenic Shenandoah Valley area of ol" Virginia served as my first experience with the <b> Powershot </b> . I was exited by the quality of the pictures I was taking. The colors were so deep and distinct. The beautiful foliage was done justice by this spectacular camera. 

  I was particularly impressed with the pictures we took from a scenic outlook. If you've been to that area you may know those beautiful vistas. From a vantage point high in the Blue Ridge Mountains a vast valley stretches out far into the horizon. The <b> Powershot </b> comes with a three point auto focus where you just put the person or object inside a frame and the camera focuses (foci ?) on that. For example, suppose you want to focus on your wife at the left corner of your picture frame with the Shenandoah Valley filling the picture. With this camera you can do just that. A caution when using the LCD the focus can take a few second to ...focus.

  The <b> Canon Powershot G2 </b> digital camera is a versatile and  smart looking entry into the digital camera field. The <b> Powershot </b> is packed with a hosts of features. All the buttons are placed in convenient locations for ease of use. You can use this camera conventionally as a plain vanilla point and shoot camera or you can delve into the more exotic features.

  LCD monitor can be tilted in or out, up and down in order to facilitate greater flexibility when using the <b> Powershot </b>. When you are not using the monitor it secures back into place against the camera body. It is easy to see the images via the LCD screen. Even in bright conditions the picture will not fade out.

  The picture quality is very clear. The CCD consists of 4.1 megapixel. At the highest resolution your image will be made up of a field of 2272 by 1704 pixels. This camera is also very solidly built. It has a good heavy and substantial feel about it.

   Good battery life.The lithium battery is long lasting. Whether I'm at the Little League field, camping or at a family reunion; I'm able to take 'reams' of pictures with no worries of a battery running down.

  The manual. The manual is clearly written. It explains all the capabilities of this advanced camera in simple and concise language. if you are more of a beginner, like me, you can slowly learn as many or as few of the application as you want. I doubt if I'll ever learn all there is to learn about the <b> Powershot </b> but still it's there whenever I need it.

  Price. I wasn't used to paying right at $800 for a camera. That was a hurdle to cross  but after seeing the picture quality and all the other things that the <b> Powershot </b> can do, I was able to justify the expense. It's so much more than an ordinary camera. I'm expect many years of happy memories recorded in vivid detail. In the past I've had too many pictures turn out to be disappointing in quality. That hasn't happened with the <b> Canon Powershot </b> and that alone makes it worth every penny I paid.
