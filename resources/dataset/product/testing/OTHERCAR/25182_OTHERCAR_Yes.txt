            Riding in this car is great fun. All the controls are where you want the to be, and there is room for extra stuff. This car also maintains a sport-car ambiance. I think I feel this way because the interior reminds me of the 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse. This helps the car blend between the compact 4-door and coupe styles. The seats are also very comfortable; they hold you and offer support.

The exterior styling is very conservative, but has a few areas which remind people of Ford's &quot;new edge&quot; design. The fenders are swelled; not the same way as the Ford Focus, but more so than other cars. The head lamps are similar, but maintain their individuality. This car design scheme is very similar to the MPV and the 2001 Mazda Tribute. The overall shape of the car is aggressive, but conservative.

This car was rated by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; as the best compact car. It beat out perennial favorites such as the Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic. The report combined statistics on safety, reliability, and independent tests by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;  <br><br>
