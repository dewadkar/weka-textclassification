            The <b> Chevy Cavalier </b> is a very reliable car, not so much responsive like an import of it's class like a Nissan Sentra or a Honda Civic, but great for commuters and 1st time new car buyers with a small budget.
I owned the car about 9 months with no complains at all. Hard to get the front wheels spinning because it's not a sports car and it lacks performance.
The car is a great looking vehicle with good shapes in and out, even with it's cheap interior finishes. The fabric in the seats are very rough but very hard to get dirty.
The only reason I have purchased this car was my small budget in 1998 and the shape of the car, was the most appealing car with the lower window sticker price.
The motor is something noisy but at highway speeds you loose the sensivity of your ears with the A/C on and the radio.
One of the best things of this car is the availability of aftermarket parts and accesories to customize it.
In resume the handling is good but not the best for a car of this size, but as a cheap domestic car the car do it's best to maintain the Chevy reputation high in the market.
Well, this is a car for somebody not looking for lot of performance but many accesories in the market for well customization.
