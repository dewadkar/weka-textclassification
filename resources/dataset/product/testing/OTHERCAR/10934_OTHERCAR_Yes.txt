            It's hard to start writing about a car that is so fantastic in many ways.  To start off, BMW's new design makes the car look much more sporty, yet still elegant with its more streamlined look.  Furthermore, the car sits closer to the ground due to the widening of the base of the car.  This thereby increases the stability of the car at higher speeds and during sharp turns.  I purchased the car last year during the summer from Germany.  I was on a wait list at the time for the year 2000 model, which is the same as the 1999, except with newer parts.  Nonetheless, with the Premium System which is standard with the 328i, I was living in heaven.  Furthermore, the new 328i has much more a a &quot;kick&quot; in comparison to its younger brother the 323i in terms of engine capabilities.  In the older series, the difference between the higher and lower three series were not as appreciable.  However, the 328i has an engine that is worth test driving.  This definately can be appreciated when driving a stick shift.  Ultimately, I would recommend this car for several reasons: sporty drive with luxury (leather seats available, lumbar support, moon roof, speed sensitive steering, etc.), great handling, new design looks spectacular, and finally, of course, it's a Beamer!!!  There is no true dislike to this car except for the price.  But then, you get what you pay for!<br><br>
