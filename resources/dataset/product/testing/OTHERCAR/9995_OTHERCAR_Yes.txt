                   Going Car shopping?  You might want to stop by the KIA dealer in your town.  It might even be worth the drive to find your nearest dealer!  If you want a small car with alot of room inside, this will be worth the look.  Yes, there are more sporty cars out there, but if you want comfort and &quot;some style&quot; for the price of a total economy, this Kia Sephia is a must have.
      Would I buy another one?  Sure.  With gas prices going up daily this is one of the smartest purchases I have made so far this year.  Okay,
it's not a Trans-Am or a Lexus, but let's face it, could you buy a 2000 model car with all the bells and whistles for under $12,000? This little
package stands up quite well to all of it's comparable competition.        
      Well... Like I said a Lexus it ain't.  The salesman will probably try to sell you the more pricey Sportage.  But, look and drive the Sephia.
You never know, your rich Uncle may leave you his fortune because your not spend thrifty.
      The Interior has all the room of a more pricier car, plenty of passenger room.  Everything is nicely placed and driver friendly.  The trunk is spacey and a shopper's delight.  Power windows for convenience
is another nice feature.  The Sephia rides smooth and comfortable and handles well in rainy situations.
      My overall opinion:  Yes, this is a very smart investment for a teenage family member or yourself or someone who wants to get a lot of 
bang for their bucks.
