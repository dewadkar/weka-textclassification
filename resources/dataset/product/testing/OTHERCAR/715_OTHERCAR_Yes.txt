            Lets start this out on the correct footing, this camera is NOT your mom's point and click. Nikon has aimed for the professional or serious recreational photographer with the 950 Coolpix. With a complete range from full automatic to full manual, this camera is the first digital camera that convinced me that it might be time to retire my trusty Cannon 35mm SLR from day to day use. Nikon has done their homework with this camera. Nikor glass, x2 digital zoom, bright LCD screen with optical viewer, virtually everything adjustable by the user this camera is a dream. There is a steep learning curve and some quirks of being a digital camera that one must learn. The shutter is not instant unlike an SLR. There is a split second pause before the picture is actually taken. On the plus side, you can use &quot;best of&quot; setting where a series of pictures are automatic and the best is picked. A very good feature is the ablility to program power usage and save on battery life. The body is metal and the handgrip is perfect to grab and places you fingers in the correct spot to use the controls. 

The LCD display is well laid out to convey the various settings but it's not backlit so in the dark, it's tough to use. ( if it is, I have not been able to find the switch) Which brings up a point about the controls. Well designed they are but it requires much practice to learn where and what they are. Like any complex piece of equipment, practice is the key with this camera both for taking the pictures and using the controls.

The camera comes with a 8meg memory card which can hold 8 FINE , 16 NORMAL ,32 BASIC, 19 XGA FINE, 39 XGA NORMAL &lt;my choice&gt;, 78 XGA BASIC, 50 VGA FINE, 100 VGA NORMAL,200 VGA BASIC  and you can mix and match on the fly. I have found that for most work I do, the standard 34 shots of XGA is just fine. You can always replace the card with a larger memory card if you want. Now comes the fun part. You have to download the pictures to your PC. Nikon includes a serial cable but when you download 34 pictures, you will see why I HIGHLY recommend a card reader and USB port interface. I shudder to think of using the serial cable to download 200 pictures.

The software included is functional if not exceptional. It works and does it;s job well which is to download pictures but that is all. I would highly recommend using a paint package along the lines of PaintShop Pro which will talk to the camera directly via TWAIN and the serial cable. 

Many people complain about battery life and with good cause. The only way I will use this camera is with 2 sets of the new Nickle Metal Hydride batteries. These batteries cost roughly the same as NiCads and last two to hree times as long. The point is I can shoot 80 pics with flash and download all of them and still have battery life left. Try that with a coppertop.. NOT. I bought the 8 batteries &lt;AA&gt; and charger for 45 dollars&lt;US&gt;  Worth every penny.

Do I have ANY complaints? Yep, for the pice of the camera, the battery cover is one of the cheesiest things around. The tripod mount when used blocks the batteries and memory card. And to add insult to injury, the tripod threads are PLASTIC.. thats a problem waiting to happen.The camera's automatic focus has real problems in dim conditions. The include documentation is VERY bad and not at all up to the Nikon standard. The included case has a fatal flaw to your camera, there is a short little hook that you instinctively grab. Wrong move, there is a snap on it that comes un-snapped and your camera takes a fall. The flash tends to impart a blueish tint unless you are careful with it's use.

Over all Nikon has a winner here without a doubt. I get all sorts of attention whenever I use it in public, the pictures are super and it's compact enough to travel anywhere with me.

Like many others, I shopped around for my best price. All the local stores were charging list and calling it a deal. I found a good deal online which saved me over 200 dollars. So shop around and since it's become so popular, be prepared to pay for it.
