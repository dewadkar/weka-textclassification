            The CRV is for the Al Gore voters of the vehicle world - for those of us used to accepting compromises, it's a solid middle ground between price, performance, and utility.

I've had my 1999 EX model for a year now and it is doing fine - the short wheelbase makes it easy to park in my small garage and cramped parking spaces, I am getting about 23 MPG, and the vehicle is comfy and roomy. It's biggest drawback has been noise - remmeber this is an SUV and at highway speeds above 70 mph and on rough pavements it is quite noisy inside (a lot of this seems to come from the truck tires it comes with, the rest comes form the engine which revs to about 3800 rpm at 75). This is not a high-mileage, go-fast, luxurious, or haul-anything vehicle but instead stands in a solid middle ground among all of those design choices - think a Civic pickup on stilts.<br><br>
