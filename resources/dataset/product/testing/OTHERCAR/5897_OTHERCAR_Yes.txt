            The Dodge Quad cab sport is the most useful durable and dependable vehicle I've ever owned.

The best feature is, of course the quad doors.  Children can easily help themselves in and out.  Shopping is a snap as well.  The seat folds up out of the way easily to carry larger items in out of all weather.

The seats, including the rear are extremely comfortable.  Adults can ride in the rear just as comfortably as children.

The ride and handling are remarkable as well. The short bed sport turns on a dime and rides like a car. (Yes 4 X 4 too.)  This truck is like owning a SUV with the extra advantage of a truck bed. Power is not a problem either.  I have never been afraid to pass another vehicle.

All temperature and radio controls are within easy reach and work well.
The stereo is very nice as well, with good quality speakers and easy to operate controls.

My only complaint, and a minor one at that would be fuel mileage.  That problem would be solved by buying a smaller engine, I have the 360ci.  I also had problems with the engine &quot;pinging&quot;, but this problem was solved by using higher octane fuel, ie 91-not gasohol.

All in all I am very pleased with this vehicle and would recommend it to anyone looking for room and dependability.<br><br>
