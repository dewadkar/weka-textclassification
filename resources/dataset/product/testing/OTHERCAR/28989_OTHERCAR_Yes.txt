            We shopped around for a replacement for our aging Ford Windstar minivan.  The only &quot;real&quot; requirements were that it be high like the van, but not as big.  We had owned a Chevrolet Blazer back in the early nineties and didn't like it all that much (too small, essentially) but I thought that those requirements would require another SUV.

I checked around online, and, with the limited options available in Grand Forks, North Dakota, decided to look at the Nissan Xterra, Honda Passport and the CR-V.  Fortunately, they were all located at the same dealer, which made things easier.  We ignored the Blazer, based on past experience, and the Explorer and Toyotas seemed a bit pricey for what you get.

It turned out that the dealer didn't have any automatic transmission Xterras (a base requirement), so that option went away.  We drove both the Passport and the CR-V, and while the Passport was more comfortable (with its leather interior), the CR-V drove much more smoothly and felt roomier because of the high head room and lack of &quot;stuff&quot; that tends to clog up the area between the two front seats in most cars (big console, cup holders, etc.)

We've had it for several months now, and have taken it on two fairly long trips.  It is very comfortable on long rides, and while it doesn't seem that it would have much storage room, we easily packed four suitcases and a couple of computer bags in the back of the vehicle without blocking the rear view.

The ride is very comfortable -- much more like a car than the other SUVs I've been in.  It feels very solid on the road and seems to have better stability than the Jeep Cherokee that I drive at work.  I've seen complaints about the power, and while it is indeed not much of a work horse, it seems to do just fine for in town and interstate highway driving.

The interior is a bit on the spartan side, but very functional.  We were rather disappointed that leather seats are NOT an option.  The window controls at the driver's seat are located in a very confusing location (on the dashboard) and the &quot;window power&quot; button, when turned off, prevents the use of ALL power windows, not just those in the back seat.

Our CR-V came with a CD player, which works fine, with fairly simple controls.  The sound is a bit shallow, though.  Air conditioning and heating systems seem pretty good, although the lowest fan setting is a bit too high for my tastes.

This is a fully decked out EX model, complete with roof rack, mud flaps on all four tires and &quot;running boards&quot; that seemed a wasteful expense, but the dealership declined to remove them for credit, so we kept them.  We added floor mats (why aren't these included as standard on a $21,000 car?), back area carpet mat, and an auto-starter.

<b>Update:</b>  Well, we're several months into winter in North Dakota, and I'm happy to report that this handles like a champ on both snow and ice packed streets.  You need to be wary of overdriving, however, as four wheel drive does <b>not</b> make braking any better!  The ABS works well, though, and I think I've only skidded into one or two intersections thus far (around here, that's far less than average.)  There's no visual indication that you're in FWD mode, which would be nice, but there's no comparison between the traction and stability exhibited by this vehicle and in my Saturn SL2, which slides all over the place.

If you have more than one kid, there's probably not going to be enough room in this vehicle for long trips.  For two or three people, though, I think this is a great vehicle for in-town and interstate highway driving.<br><br>
