            I bought this vehicle for one reason, the looks. It just looks really cool.  It has other things, too.  It goes fast, has four wheel drive, it is part convertible, and it is cheap.  It is a really good car, I have been very happy with it, even though I have only the bottom of the line.  I would definitely suggest buying a Suzuki again.

From the inside out, the Suzuki X-90 is a really fun car.  The small compact design makes it a must for small garages, the sporty looks, make it an attraction on and off the road.  The seats are really comfortable, which surprised me since most SUVs are not that comfortable.  Even the sound system surprised me.  All of the features in this car are easy to use and easily accessible.  

Most of all, I like the fact that it has four wheel drive and can easily go off road.  There is a couple bad things I have found out about this car, and that is that it cannot hold all of your camping gear, also the gas mileage is not that great.

The Suzuki has a surprisingly comfortable feel when driving, on all types of roads from back roads to the interstates.  The steering is slick and smooth and the radius is tight.  The top speed is just over 100 and the pedals are easy to reach and push.  The manual transmission is slick and easy to shift.  The suspension is also really nice.  Also, the acceleration is very fast, so you can pick up and go.

For two years this car has held up, and it only needs to have the regular checkups and oil change.  When off road, nothing seems to smash, break, or do anything of the sort.  This car is very durable, and can handle any conditions.

I would recommend this car to anyone who is fun or likes to be outside, speaking you can go anywhere and do anything in this car.
