            <i> This is an updated opinion. </i>

<b> Why I Bought This Vehicle </b>
I bought the Honda CR-V because I this is a great truck. I also bought this truck because the price was reasonable for its class, it has good fuel economy, Honda makes reliable vehicles, I like its cargo capacity and it looks good.  Further, Consumer Reports magazine rated this truck very highly.  Additionally, after the test drive the dealer was willing to work with me on the cost.

<b> So Far, So Good </b>
I have put over 5,000 miles on my CR-V in less than 120 days. Not one problem with the vehicle. I bought the 2000 LX auto model, it comes with lots of storage space, cup holders and room for all passengers. It also comes standard with a picnic table in the spot where the spare tire often is placed on cars below the trunk. Overall it is a relatively spacious vehicle and it is fun to drive.

<b> Test Drive </b> 
I liked the CR-V when I test drove it. I also test drove the Nissan Xterra, Jeep Wrangler, Chevy Blazer and Toyota Rav4. I liked the Xterra and CR-V. When I was shopping for a small SUV, the Nissan dealers here in Northern California wanted me to pay MSRP or above. The Honda dealer I went to, Menlo Honda in Redwood City, was much more reasonable about price. I paid $5,000 less for the CR-V than the Nissan dealers wanted for the Xterra.  

<b> Blind Spot and Acceleration </b> 
Unfortunately, I have noticed a large blind spot that I believe has to do with side mirror placement. The vehicle also lacks acceleration ability going uphill. (Don't paint racing stripes on this bad boy 4 cylinder.)  Neither of these issues has been a serious problem for me, but they should be kept in mind while driving for safety. 

<b> Cargo Space </b> 
If you need to haul your sports gear, luggage, bikes or small furniture, the CR-V can get the job done. I have put all of these and more in the trunk/cargo hold. The rear seats fold down and out of the way. I brought my dining room set home from IKEA myself, and saved on shipping.  

<b> Odds and Ends </b> 
You can park it in a compact car spot, which is nice.   I used to drive a chevy suburban, and you need two spots to park that puppy!  There is only a driver's side arm rest in the CR-V, with a passenger side option, which is a little odd. The engine is the Honda Civic engine. The truck handles well. It comfortably seats 4 with ample leg and head room for all. Roof rack is an optional feature, so are side rails (a/k/a step plates) automatic transmission, spare tire cover, steel alloy wheels and many other typical options. Perhaps best of all, the tires have not been recalled as they have been on the Ford Explorer.  I have a brush guard (a/k/a front grill guard) and tail light covers which I ordered from a non-Honda parts store.  They look great.<br><br>
