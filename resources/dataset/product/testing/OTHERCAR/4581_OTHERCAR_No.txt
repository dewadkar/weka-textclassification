            I bought a used 1997 Hyundai Elantra GLS in April of this year.  I was originally impressed with its sleek appearance and low gas mileage.  I felt that I received a good deal--$6500 from a dealer for a car still under manufacturers warranty.

It turned out that the Elantra wasn't right for me.  I have car seats for an infant and a toddler, and I was never comfortable with the way they fit into the back seat of the car.  The seat belt wasn't long enough to fit around the infant seat, making it nearly impossible to take in and out.  The seats in the back seemed to be shaped for comfort, but did not accommodate the child seats well.

I regularly had a problem with the check engine light coming on, but no one could seem to find anything wrong with the vehicle.  This made me a little nervous.  After I traded the vehicle, I found out there was a recall on the gas caps of this year and model.  Apparently, some were not fitted properly.

The Hyundai was great on gas mileage, even while running the A/C on a regular basis.  The GLS model came equipped with cruise control, and power locks and windows.  The insurance rates were affordable.

For a small car, the trunk had a decent amount of space.  There didn't seem to be much leg room in the back seat, but this was never an issue for us as my oldest child was 2.
