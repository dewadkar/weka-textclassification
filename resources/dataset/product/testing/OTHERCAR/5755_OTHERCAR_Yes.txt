             I'm only in my early 20's and I don't even feel un-cool in my dad's old station wagon. My dad bought this car, brand new, off the lot. He works in the medical field, just like me. His job involves a lot of home care, which means he has to drive to people's houses several times a week. He also needs to bring equipment such as oxygen tanks and ventilators. He wanted a car that had good gas mileage, good storage space, and reliability. After much searching, he settled on our Mercury Tracer Wagon. He also used the car for regular old family stuff like taking me to school, grocery shopping, and trips. He put <i> a lot </i> of miles on that car within two years, mainly due to home care. 

 For a little under $15,000 dollars, this four door station wagon came with air conditioning, a tape player, cruise control (which stretches your gas dollars even more), power windows and locks, rear defrosters, power mirrors, dual airbags and a few other goodies. Space isn't much of a problem, unless your a tall person in the back seat. My father is 6'2&quot; and he was never uncomfortable driving. 

 After I got my license, my dad never saw the car again. Just kidding. I love that car and drive it so often that my dad finally gave it to me. He now has another car. Like my dad, I'm involved in home care so I am driving back and forth between patient homes almost everyday. After four years, my car has over 80,000 miles on it. That's pretty uncommon for such a young car. But, my dad taught me how to take care of the car so that it will last longer. I make sure it gets it's oil change when that's due. I use the best gas (Ultra 94). I don't rough around with it. It has barely been in the shop for repairs. The timing belt had to be changed last year after 65,000 miles(which is recommended). That was the most major thing. We only had to replace one tire, because I hit a HUGE pothole when avoiding an accident (thanks to someone running a red light). The tire and rim were damaged. The other three tires are original and in great shape. 

 I haven't experienced many problems with this car. I drive back and forth to college nearly every day.  I also go out with my friends a lot and I'm usually the driver. The leg room in the back can be a problem but anyone sitting behind me is okay because I'm (ahem) vertically challenged and my seat is moved up far. It doesn't look like a dumpy old-folks station wagon. It's actually pretty sleek. It's easy to get a carseat fastened into the seats. I baby-sit my niece quite often so I'm always putting the carseat (recently it's been a booster seat since she's growing up so fast) in. The space in the very back (under the hatch) is great. I always have a coat, two sleeping bags, a blanket, a first aid kit, and some other items in the back part. With all of that, I still have room for groceries (I'm talking 15-20 bags here). When my niece was a little bit younger, I was always loading her playpen, stroller, and toys into that back part with no problem. My dog likes it, too. I'm always taking her to the park and she loves to lay all the way in the back, on top of the sleeping bags. My 95lb Golden Retriever/German Shepard mix doesn't seem to have a problem. 

 Driving is smooth and pleasant. The brakes are excellent, as is the steering. I can easily navigate tight turns. You should see this baby make U-turns. Tight. The car can be noisy. It appears that passengers in the back seat hear the most noise. It drives well on all road conditions. We recently had a blizzard in this area and I did great driving to and from work in all that snow. I never got stuck. This isn't the car for you if you want to drag race with your buddies. The pick up isn't too bad, but it's not as powerful as a sportscar. 

 All in all, the Mercury Tracer is a great car. It looks good, it feels good, and it drives good. We made an excellent choice! <br><br>
