            My wife and recently test drove a few different models of the outback, from the base 4 cylinder to the loaded LL. Bean. 
My wife fell in love. We both liked the styling and the features of this mini-S.U.V. She really likes the exterior size. 
Before I critique this vehicle you need to know what kind of vehicles we drive on a daily basis. My wife drives a 98 Acura 2.3CL, I drive a 00 Chevy Silverado. Both of these vehicles are loaded with all the available options. Our third vehicle is a 95 Dodge Neon.
We started out in the 4 cylinder model. I wasn't that impressed. The power was lacking and it didnt have the gadgets we are used too. The ride was pretty smooth. We liked the layout of the interior and location of the controls. It was fairly equipped for the base model, but I wouldnt buy it.
The LL Bean was like a different car. A 6 cyl. is standard on the LL Bean. Power felt double that of the 4 cyl. The 6 cyl. is so smooth I thought it had died when we stopped at a light. The ride was even smoother due to the tweaked suspension. The Leather was soft,the seats were nice and firm. It also had the features we are more accustomed too, like climate control, nice sound system and more power features.
My wife works in the city and has to park in a very tight garage, one thing we look at when researching a vehicle is the turning radius. The outback passed this one with flying colors.
I thought the brakes were a little mushy, but you cant judge stopping distance by pedal feel. The outback stops great, The four wheel disc hauls the car down to a stop in no time.
We have 2 kids and 2 dogs and a small business so the cargo space is very important. I liked the rear seats that fold down flat. And the roof rack adds even more versatility. We are also avid mountainbikers. The lower roof line of the outback would make it easier to remove our bikes from the roof.
The only drawback is the price of the top model, almost 31,000. I had serious sticker shock. We drove an 02 Acura TL
that is a gorgeous luxury sedan for the same sticker price.

We are going to buy an outback but not this year. We try to only buy vehicles when they are at the end of the model year. That we  get the best price and usaully get better financing. This year we waited to long and missed out on the loaded models. The 02 models are out but I dont want to spend over 30,000 When I can wait a year and get it at invoice. We will be driving an 02 next year.
