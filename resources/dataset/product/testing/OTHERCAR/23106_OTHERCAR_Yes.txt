            This is and excellent digital camera for the digital camera beginner.  This is my first digital camera, which I bought for work.  It enables me to take clear picture of Machine Parts that I need to order but have no part number.  I snap the shot, if I don't like the angle, I just delete the picture from the camera's memory and snap another.  Then I just hook the camera up to my work computer (all cables come with the camera, plus the easy to use Polroid software) copy it to my hard drive.  Then I just Email the picture as an attachment to the manufacture.

I checked out many digital cameras before buying the Polaroid, but by my comparison, this camera was the best for the price.  And simply put, it work great.<br><br>
