               In October of 1997 I bought my first new car- a 1997 Hyundai Accent G-2 Door Hatchback with a standard transmission.  My reasoning for buying this particular car were simple- I was a first time buyer, and I could only get financed at one dealership-I had the option between the Ford Aspire and the Hyundai Accent.  Upon discovering that the Accent had 97 horsepower as opposed to the Aspire's measly 60, the decision was rather simple, I would take the car that was &quot;one step up from a John Deere Tractor&quot;.  I was also impressed with the body style as opposed to the similarly priced Aspire.  I can honestly say that I never would have been a proud owner of a Hyundai, because of there previous bad reputation; but as far as I am concerned, it is an incredible car for the money- I have yet to have a major problem with my car, and I am not a very nice driver as far as cars are concerned- I tend to rev the engine too high constantly, neglect oil changes until about 5,000 miles, and generally play too hard with the car.  The only thing I have had to replace were the tires, after 10,000 miles- partially due to excessive &quot;peeling out&quot; but also, I can't say that the factory tires were anything to brag about- they (General, 13 inch) were at best cheap and tawdry- hardly something I felt comfortable riding on.
   As far as being a pleasure to drive, I can say that the pick-up on the standard transmission is above-average for this price range.  I am able to race my pick of other vehicles without too much selection, and compete well.  I do notice various rattling thoughout the vehicle, but none of it is consistant or too bothersome.  As far as ride goes, I find it to be slighly bumpy, but not too very uncomfortable. 
   I wouldn't recommend this vehicle to a large person, or to a family, although I have a 10 month old daughter I am able to put in and out of her car-seat rather easily; but I can see that I would prefer a 4 door model soon.
   I think that the most important negative aspect of this vehicle to realize is: This is not a car for someone who plans on trading the Accent in for a new vehicle before it is paid off.  My car depreciated $2,500 the moment I drove it off the lot, and after 2 1/5 years of payments, I still owe more than it is worth trade in-value.  This car has to be a long term &quot;keeper&quot; if you don't want to lose your shirt on it.  It is a very poor investment, but fine for basic transportation.  Fortunately, with the incredible warranty Hyundai is now offering, that makes it worth it to buyers who are looking for a car to keep until it finally dies for good.<br><br>
