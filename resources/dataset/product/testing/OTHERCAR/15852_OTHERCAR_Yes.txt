            My wife has pleaded to me for years to get a Suburban. Of course,I hesitated due to the cost of this vehicle, gee whiz! $35,000 to $40,000.(This was back in '98.) I finally caved in and purchased a GMC Suburban K1500 with 4-Wheel Drive and I am delighted to say that this was one of the smartest investments I have ever made. You can comfortably seat 8 adults and still have plenty of cargo storage space behind the third seat. The engine is powerful enough to get this big thing moving up mountains, passing vehicles and getting onto freeways with no problems. I did have concern about my wife being able to handle driving such a large vehicle but she tells me she loves driving it because sees everything around her due to being higher than the other vehicles on the road and has no problems parallel parking. For long trips the Suburban is the best vehicle on the market, due to the smooth and quiet ride, the comfortable seats, and the huge 44 gallon gas tank. 
The only drawbacks that I have with the Suburban is the gas mileage. It is not very efficient, about 12mpg (City), 16mpg (Highway). I also had to replace the brake pads at 30,000 miles, but what do you expect from such a large and heavy vehicle. I heard they improved the brakes on the newer Suburbans(The 2000 models are now called Yukon XL).  I highly recommend the Suburban to large and small families, it's the safest vehicle on the road! <br><br>
