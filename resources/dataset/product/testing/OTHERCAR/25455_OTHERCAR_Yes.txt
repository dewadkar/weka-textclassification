            Recently i purchased a 1998 Saturn SL2.  I concidered many different cars but Saturns had a reputation for being good, safe cars so i gave them a little more thought.  After visiting many different dealerships i went to the Saturn dealership and i was treated quite differently.  First of all, the car salesman actually talked to me and not the guy i was with.  Secondly when i said that i was only looking and i would let him know if i had any questions i was left alone.  I found that to be quite nice.  After a couple months of looking for a car that was nice and in my price range i came across my car.  When i test drove it i was surprised how smoothly it drove and how much power it had.  The car was comfortable enough, and i did notice a little vibration noise, but i wasn't botherd by it.  

About one month after i bought my new car some guy driving a big sport utility vehicle decided not to look before pulling out into an intersection.  He pulled out right in front of me and although i slammed on the brakes, i was going to fast and there just wasn't enough time to stop.  Neither my passenger or I was injured.  I thought having such a small car was dangerous, but I was supprised at what little damage was done to my car even though i was going about 40 MPH at the time of the impact.  My car was even still driveable.  

When i took the car to the dealership to have it fixed they were very nice and took care of my car quickly.  In all the fender, hood, and bumper had to be replaced but they did a full inspection of my car to make sure there were no other damages.  I was told that my car would never be the same after the accident, but i can't tell the difference, now that i have gotten my car back.  All in all i've been very happy with my Saturn and the treatment i got.  And i'm very happy with how safe my car really is.<br><br>
