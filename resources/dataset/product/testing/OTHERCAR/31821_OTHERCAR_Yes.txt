            When I moved to New Jersey for my new job, post graduation, I learned that I need a car to get ANYWHERE in New Jersey.  I didn't have my license, nor any idea as to how to drive a car, let along buying a car.
After getting my license, I did my research on what kind of car I wanted to get.  My choices were eventually narrow down to the Corolla, Civic, and the Saturan SL-2.  Being on a limited budget, these three cars all came with good reviews and cute GEN-X design.  After test driving my choices, I decided on the Civic LX.  I personally love the design of the car and how it handles my style of driving...  Not that I've been driving for a very long time.  Anyway, Civic is just the cutest thing around.
I've been driving all over the place since.  I've driven to Albany(3 hours away), Philadelphia(3-4 hours), New York City(an hour), all without a single groan from my little civic.  The interior is perfectly big for me and my friends, the CD player(extra) is a nice thing to have while driving on long trips.  The size of the car makes it easy to parallel park in NYC(A nightmare if you ask me).  I've had the car for almost a year now, and the only problem I've had with it is a flat tire.  There are only two things that I think would increase my love for this car.  One is that during the winter, it takes a bit for the heater to get warmed up.  I remember sitting in my car freezing for about 5 - 10 minutes before the heat would start getting warm.  The second thing is, if you like speed, Civic is a little awkward at picking up the paste.
The civic is a great car for a first time buyer, and certainly well worth the money considering how much value it has in the used car market.
I would recommend this car because it's a great buy and holds it's value like nothing else.

This is a review for the 2000 Civic..  See what I mean when I said that I have not the first clue about cars??  It doesn't really matter anyway because I think the 1999 model and the 2000 model are basically the same.
