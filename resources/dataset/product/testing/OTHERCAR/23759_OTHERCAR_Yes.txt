            On January 20, 2002 I purchased a used 2001 Isuzu Trooper 4WD S from CarMax in Rockville, MD for (including tax, tags, and processing fees) $19,455.  When I took delivery of the vehicle it had just under 6,000 miles on it.

I found the car through the CarMax web site (National Database Search) in Irving Texas, and had it shipped up here.  On the web site it was classified as an LS 4WD, so I was a bit surprised to find some of the LS features missing when it arrived.  It turns out that it is the S model, but CarMax had inaccurately listed it as an LS.

After discovering this, I went back to the CarMax web site, and just about every Trooper that was listed as an LS was an S model.  The easiest way to tell is to look for the fog lights.

This is my second Isuzu.  I also own a 1991 Rodeo 4WD LS with 170,000 miles on it.  I bought this one used in 1991 with 10,000 miles on it for $16,000.  Overall I have been very satisfied with my Rodeo, so I was comfortable buying the Trooper having never driven one.

We have put about 2,000 miles on it so far.  We drove it 450 miles from Maryland to Massachusetts for a ski trip last week through Pennsylvania.  Gas mileage leaves a lot to be desired as the best we did was probably about 16 MPG and that was on the highway.  The other review here by "pick2" says he got 21 MPG... I want to know how he did this!  I found out the reason it gets such poor mileage is because the Torque-On-Demand (TOD) feature keeps the transfer case engaged all the time.  That's why the 2WD version would be much more fuel efficient.

The Trooper is a little tall to store anything on the roof.  I found even skiis were a little tricky to get on and off, and I am just under 5' 10".  I have discovered it is easy to access the roof from the step on the rear bumper.

Other than that the only complaint I have is the Yakima factory ski rack is an inferior product.  Isuzu should have put a Thule rack on this vehicle.  The latching mechanism on the Yakima tends to misfeed causing the rack to become stuck shut.  Yakima customer service says this is a problem with all their racks...but I guess this is better saved for a separate review!
