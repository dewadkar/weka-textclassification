            In 2000, after I got totally disgusted with my '97 HONDA CIVIC with less than 30,000 miles, I dumped it, and tried to decide what would make safer, more reliable transportation for my family and me.  A consultation with a friend who also happened to be the used car manager at the local Toyota dealership led to a recommendation that I look at anything Volvo produced from the mid-80's through the mid-90's that featured the following:
     1.  Rear-wheel drive (only);
     2.  The SOHC 2.3 liter 4-cylinder Volvo engine;
     3.  NO turbo; NO intercooler

The models meeting the above criteria included:
     1.  240 series
     2.  740 series (not 16-valve)
     3.  940 series (not 16-valve)

Since, by 2000 Ford's influence on Volvo engineering had fully kicked in, no rear-drive models were available.  So my field of choices strictly terminated in 1994, the last year of the 940 series.

Initially, to test the waters, I found a local dealership who specializes in used Volvos and purchased an 87 740 Wagon with 190,000 miles for $2,500.00.  In the next year and half, between my son and me, over 50,000 miles were put on the car with total repairs running under $1,000.00 for the duration.  The car was re-sold for $2,200.00.

I replaced the 87 with a 90 740 Wagon with 180,000 miles for $3,000.00.  This was in 2001, and after putting about 35,000 miles on it, I gave it to my son, who is driving the car today.  It now has about 245,000 miles, and our repair costs to date are under $1,500.00.

When I gave the 90 740 to my son, I purchased a 94 940 Wagon with 160,000 miles for $5,000.00.  Today the car has over 180,000 and a total of less than $1,000.00 to date in maintenance and repairs.

When my daughter's Pontiac was breathing its last at 80,000 miles, I bought her a 94 940 sedan with 135,000 miles for $5,500.00.  Her comment during the test drive was that the car felt better put together than the brand new Nissan and VW models she had just test-driven!  After a year, she still feels that way.

What these Volvos all have in common are the following:

     1.  Handling.  With specially engineered front and rear suspensions, these cars are well suited to smooth freeway cruising, but handle curving canyon roads with precision and aplomb.

     2.  Long distance travel.  With the best seats in the business, you can stay comfortable and alert mile after mile in these cars.  Their engineering allows them to cruise effortlessly at 90 miles an hour, although none of us wants the tickets, so we keep to sub-80 mph speeds on the freeways.

     3.  Longevity.  The design of this last generation of really honest Volvos was impeccable.  The SOHC engines will run 400,000 to 500,000 miles if properly maintained.
Because of the expense involved in engineering a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission in-house, Volvo equipped the automatic models with the TOYOTA TRUCK transmission, the sturdiest automatic Toyota was capable of producing.  Toyota truck owners tell stories of powertrains going over the 400,000 mile mark with regularity.

     4.  Safety.  I don't know how they do it, but Volvo simply holds up better in a collision than most anything that's not an SUV or full-size truck.  As a direct example
what got me mad at my 97 Honda was the over-$4,000 repair bill I had to pay to fix the damage from an 8 MPH rear-end collision with a 94 Nissan Sentra.  In addition to the body-work, engine components were destroyed in a crash that did not even actuate the air-bags!!!!!

When my son had had the 87 740 for a month, he rear-ended another vehicle at approximately 8-10 MPH.  Not only was the Volvo drivable, but the total repair bill came to less than $500.00!!!

Do the math.  The economics of owning these vintage of Volvo's given the restrictions shown in the first paragraph above, speak for themselves.

A comment was made to which this paragraph is a direct response, that this review was about several Volvos, and not the '94 940 in particular.  First of all, these are for all intents and purposes the same model with the same engineering and design specifications.  The 1987 740 has a great deal in common with the '94 940, so my comments pertain equally to all of them.  Their driving, handling, comfort and accommodations are so much alike that they are like peas from the same pod.

Having said that the '94 940 if anything is ever so slightly better in each area, but this is really hair-splitting.  The 940 impresses me as being ever so slightly more refined, ever so slightly smoother, ever so slightly more powerful, (but it's the exact same powertrain as in the others).

My satisfaction level is ever so slightly greater with the 940, but there isn't a one of the aforementioned ones that I wouldn't take back and drive with pleasure.  They are fine cars plain and simple!

One comment about the negative of these cars, fuel economy.  In todays market 16-20 mpg is mediocre at best.  However, at $2.00/gallon, the $3,000.00 you just spent at 90,000 miles, rebuilding your Taurus automatic will drive my car 24,000 miles during which its automatic will be just fine thank you!

Most independent mechanics I've spoken to agree with me that these cars are about as bullet-proof as ANYTHING made in the last 20 years, including Lexus and Mercedes.

Just be careful.  No two cars of the same model line are going to be identical at 10 years old.  Don't buy anything without a thorough mechanical diagnostic inspection, or in my case, buying the cars from a reputable dealership that specializes in the brand, knows how to repair them, and sells with a warranty.
