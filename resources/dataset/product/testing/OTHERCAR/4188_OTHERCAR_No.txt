            Where do I begin? More than anyone, I wish this dream-ride of a van was more reliable. At first we discounted the petty problems because we loved the ride and safety features of the 1996 Dodge Caravan. 

Over time, the disadvantages have come to seriously outweigh the advantages. For instance: wipers with a mind of their own (relay replaced twice at our cost to no avail); rear lock dysfunction (cannot be opened with keyless entry--replaced once at our cost to no avail); paint on front bumper peeled off in places; CD player won't eject CD; FM receiver failed; overhead temperature gauge quit; replaced brakes twice in 100,000 miles; positive battery cable corroded through; water pump replaced; transmission slips and is doomed, according to other Dodge Caravan owner reports; defrost system inadequate for harsh Montana winters (despite claims of front window defrosters, which did not prevent front wipers from dangerous freeze up, and back window was constantly freezing up). 

And last but certainly not least, we have joined the group of other Dodge Caravan owners who have  had the misfortune of experiencing what is technically not vapor locking (fuel injection precludes the possibility) but results in the same symptoms and strands you (or your teenage daughter) in traffic or out in the middle of nowhere just the same in 100 degree heat. Dodge doesn't even have a technician who is willing to try to fix the vapor lock problem--except if I'm willing to try a wide variety of repairs, such as replace the fuel pump and similar parts, all at my own expense while they experiment. 

Maybe all cars these days aren't built like they used to be, but next time I'm sure going to try to find a manufacturer who is at least trying.<br><br>
