                 I also own a 2002 Accent, which I reviewed earlier to a standing ovation. Now I'm at it again, but please withhold any applause or affectionate whistling until the end of this offering.  Thank you.  

     Attention-getting prelude aside, the little Accent made a believer out of me.  When I decided to get a second car to relieve some of the beating on the smaller bloke, Hyundai seemed a viable option.  I came across a 1990 Sonata.  After a little negotiating, I took home a car - for $700 -- with a beautiful body, sound engine, a few minor problems, and a lousy reputation.  The latter is the best thing to happen to buyers: you can practically steal a good car for peanuts.  I put a muffler on her and had one rear window power module replaced. Oh, and the temperature gauge was shorted out, so I took care of that too.  She passed state inspection on the first go-round and has been a reliable soldier since.  

    What do I like about my Sonata?  I like the ice-cold air conditioning on recently brutal hot days, and when it cools down, I really enjoy the power moonroof, which I open up to see the stars.  I like the tilt-wheel, cruise control, and power everything.  And this thing is surprisingly spry.  It gets up to 50mph in a hurry, even with a 4-banger under the hood.  I was shocked, given the relatively huge car body (for a 4-cylinder).

     What do I dislike?  The car doesn't feel as taut or supple as a Honda or Toyota, in shifting or handling.  The car's pathetic mainstream status makes it harder to lure a taut or supple woman, too.  Just kidding.  I have a girlfriend, and she's warming up to Hyundais, thank God.  I had a few lonely nights on the couch when I first brought home the Accent. ("EWW. WHY DIDN'T YOU GET A USED HONDA FOR THAT KINDA MONEY?!") This time around, she was eager to hop in and go for a ride.  The moonroof was a major hook.  

     It appears as though my lady will take over the Accent, and this big waif will become my regular ride.  I have no problems with that.  I firmly believe this car can go 200,000+ miles.  I'll keep you posted!
