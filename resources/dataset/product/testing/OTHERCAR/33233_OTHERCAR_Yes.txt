            I previously owned a 1989 Honda Civic LX and the mileage began creeping up on me.  I decided that it was time to upgrade because I was able to afford a newer car, and I wanted a bigger vehicle.  The 1997 Honda Accord LX that I bought drives smoothly, and the ride is very comfortable.  It performs well on long trips and short distances.  

I have been driving it for about a year now, and I put approximately 13,000 miles on it.  So far I have not had to make any repairs to the vehicle, and it has been a reliable form of transportation for me back and forth to work.  There is plenty of room in the back for passengers.  

This vehicle is built for the driver who commutes to work daily and still wants to have room to transport family members and friends comfortably.  This car is for the budget conscious, as it gets about 30 miles/gallon on average.  I have also been able to carry lumber and supplies in the car without any problem, as the back seat folds down.  

I would not recommend this vehicle to someone who wants a lot of power.  It is speedy enough for me, but I could see that people who are used to driving trucks or SUVs may not be impressed with the power.  I really love the way the car rides, and it handles well in bad weather.  

The only thing that I do not like about the vehicle is the electric windows are slow going up and down.  <br><br>
