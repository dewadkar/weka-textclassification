            Looking for a car that would fit  in to our standard is pretty tough because of our financial constraints.We have a baby and needed a lot of room and space. A back seat that would fit a car seat without feeling cramped.We shopped around but was always turned off by the high prices until finally, flipping through the newspaper one day found this terrific wagon, it's compact, roomy, affordable...just right for us.We have been driving around for almost 2 weeks now and the tank is still half full and believe me we have been all over!!My husband couldn't believe his eyes every time he looks at the gas meter! This car is definitely more than we asked for, I would  recommend it for people who wants to get value for their money!
