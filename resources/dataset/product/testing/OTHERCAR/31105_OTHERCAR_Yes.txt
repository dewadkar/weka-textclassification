            A true throw back to the beginigs of 4wheel drives. With little changed, and little needed to be changed you can't ask for muc more. For the price there is little out ther to challange this amazing suv.

If off road ability is what your after, this jeep can go anywhere you want. Though many are critical about its road manners, which is a very harsh ride due to stiff suspension, that is one thing you just gotta deal with in order to still have that off road abiltiy. The 4.0L 6cylinder engine provides tons of power, though at the expense of gas milage. 

This is a very capable tower too, up to 5000lbs can be hauled behind you. If cargo space is what your after, the jeep is actually pretty little. Yet there is more then enough interior space when you fold the rear seat down. The seats are kinda uncomfy at first but will wear a little and become very comfy.

This jeep is also happy being a &quot;grocery getter&quot;. Its 4 wheel drive is very easy to use, and this suv can handle any conditions imaginable.<br><br>
