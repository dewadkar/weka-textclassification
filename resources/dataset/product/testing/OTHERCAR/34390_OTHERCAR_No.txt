            I have to say I had been spoiled.   The Infiniti J-30 I had leased for three years was close to the perfect car.  Looking back, I should have bought it outright.  But no, I had to have a new car after three years of fun, trouble-free driving.  And unfortunately, the J-30 was no longer in production, so I couldn't lease a new one.  I looked at a few vehicles in a comparable price range, and one day, on a whim (because after my 1973 American Motors Hornet nightmare I had sworn I would never set foot in an American car showroom again) I went into a Cadillac dealership and was pleasantly surprised by the Catera.  It was priced right, full of goodies, and best of all (I thought at the time) it was made in Germany.   I took the plunge.  I'm still sinking.

The car didn't work right from the day it was delivered.  (Actually, delivery was delayed because the dealer didn't have it ready in time.)  Well, the was o.k. for a few thousand miles, even though one day I discovered that the left rear quarter panel wasn't fully attached to the car, and  that the &quot;chrome&quot; wheels almost immediately got covered with graphite or carbon or some black, sticky stuff from the brake pads that had to practically be sand-blasted off.  And I kind of got used to the brakes squealing continuously.  Then came the first big boo-boo:  The serpentine belt (which runs practically everything) went at 13,000 miles.  This is a major headache, and they had to send to Germany to get a replacement.

Then at 23,000 miles, the engine seized.  Just like that.  They told me the timing belt broke.  Hey, have you ever heard of an engine going after just 23,000 miles?  I haven't.  Not on a &quot;luxury&quot; car, at least.  Even my Hornet's engine lasted longer than this one.  And to replace it they had to send to Germany again.

Well, I figured, it'll be smooth sailing from now on.  No such luck, bucko.  One morning, after I backed the car out of the garage (you probably thought I was going to say &quot;pushed it&quot;), I noticed a huge puddle of pink stuff on the floor.  Hmn...could it be...sure enough, the low coolant light came on.  At least that worked.  They had to replace some lines or pipes or something in the cooling system.  Oh, and to do this, they had to remove my brand new engine.  And did I mention that the dealer had to do this twice, because the car began leaking again the day I took it home?

And my troubles continue, to this day.   Where is my Catera?  Back in the shop, of course.  This time, the wipers have gone haywire.  They overlap each other like they're fighting to see who's stronger.  The bracket holding the car phone spins around like a top.  And the brakes pull severely to the right.  (Oops, I forgot to mention I had to have a major break job about 500 miles ago).  They'll probably tell me to steer to the left.

So, what do I love about this vehicle?  It gives me humorous stories to relate.  What do I hate?  It's out to kill me.  Who should buy this vehicle?  Maybe the criminally insane, but I wouldn't wish it on them, either.  And to think:  I still have two years left on the lease!     <br><br>
