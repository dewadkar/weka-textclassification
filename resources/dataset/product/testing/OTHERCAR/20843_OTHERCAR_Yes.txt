            I test drove a 2001 Toyota Prius at the local dealership.  It was different from the many other test drives I have been taking recently.  They only had one and the car was owned by Toyota, Inc.  I had to sign a form to drive it.  They told me that if I liked it and wanted one, I could put down a $1,000 deposit and order the car.  I would have it in about six months.  However, they are in such demand that if a buyer backs out, he could sell it the next day.  "So why doesn't the dealership order a half a dozen of them," I asked.  The response did not make much sense.  They just have a different marketing plan on this model.  

The chassis is the same as the Toyota Echo model.  The car was nice.  It drove well.  It is better than its competition in the Honda Insight in that it has four seats and a trunk.  The Insight has two seats and enough room to take your lunch with you.  Handling, braking, and acceleration were all acceptable.

I did not like the controls.  The display is way up front on the dash.  It was unsettling.  I think one would get used to that in a few days.  That is what my friend who owns an Echo tells me.  What really did bother me was the shift lever.  It sticks out of the dashboard at an odd angle and blocks the controls to the radio.  There was a monitor screen present but it did not work and the salesman did not explain it at all.  

The car I drove was very plain.  Few options are offered.  The 2002 model offers more than the 2001 model did: daytime running lights, cruise control, navigation system, driver and front passenger seat-mounted side-impact air bag Supplemental Restraint System.  Available accessories are: wheel locks, carpeted floor mats, Glass Breakage Sensor, cargo net, single-disc CD player or 6-disc in-dash CD changer.  That is all.  Don't ask me the difference between an "option" and an "accessory."  

The main selling feature of this car is its new technology.  Buy this car if you want the prestige of owning the first hybrid vehicle on your block.  Buy it if you care about the environment and want a low-emission vehicle.  Buy it if you are a technology freak who likes to have the latest stuff.  But don't buy it for its fuel economy.  You could buy a nice Toyota Echo for $13,000 or less that gets about 40 MPG.  You will be saving about $8,000 compared to the cost of the Prius.  That will buy you at least 4,000 gallons of gas!  Over 100,000 miles of driving, the Prius will only use about 500 gallons less fuel  than the Echo!
