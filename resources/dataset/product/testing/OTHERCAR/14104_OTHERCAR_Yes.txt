            This truck is probably the best vehicle around, it is not a small little truck, but it isn't a large truck either, its perfect.  The one that I owned had a 3.9 liter V-6 under the hood with a manual transmission.  It got great gas mileage both in the city, and on the highway (as long as I wasn't driving like a mad man).  The interior was nicely arranged, considering the fact it was a little boxy inside.  The seats were very comfortable, even on long rides.  I drove this truck to many states in the short time I owned it, and a lot of miles were put on it, and it still ran like new.  The body style was nice looking, it was a little boxy looking, but it was not as bad as some of the competition.  Overall, I would highly recommend this vehicle to someone buying a truck for the first time, or even for a new driver.  It is a very safe vehicle, the airbags work very well, I know this from personal experience.<br><br>
