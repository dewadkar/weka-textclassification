            After my 1998 Maxima GLE lease was up I decided to upgrade to an Infiniti. I purchased a brand new pearl white 2001 I30 with every opinion except for the navigation system. My initial feeling was that the I30 was basically a Maxima is a tux. With 5 more hp. But after only a day of owning the car I realized that the I30 is very different from a Maxima. My 98 Maxima was my fourth Maxima so I was very used to driving them. The I30 feels heavier, the steering is more solid then the Maxima, and the transmission shifts a lot smoother. The fit and finish on the I30 is superior to that of the Maxima�s. The exterior of the I30 is more elegant with classier taillights, and corning lights up front. The corning lights are a great feature, and real must have for any luxury car.  The I30's interior is very well appointed and the leather seats are much softer then the Maxima's. The LCD gauges are a nice addition to the cockpit and the radio and cruise controls on the steering wheel are well placed. The climate control system and radio are well placed and perfect in their operation. There is plenty of legroom for drivers over 6'0 and generous headroom as well. The traction control system works very smoothly and doesn't allow much slippage before it engages. 
Driving Experience: 
The I30 drives like a true luxury car should. It soaks up all the bumps and potholes in the road and always stays on track. The 227 horsepower engine is silky smooth and lets out a nice growl when pushed. The I30's handling is great but is more tune for a luxury ride then a sports car ride like the Maxima's. The I30's rear end begins to float a little when the car is pushed on twisty roads where as the Maxima stays planted to the road. The Maxima is a better car for driving fast along twisting roads and the I30 is a better highway cruiser. I30's engine delivers better response at 60 - 80mph then the Maxima does and the I30's rides better on straight-aways. But all this is exactly what Nissan wanted. The Maxima is the sportier car and the I30 is the Luxury car. And both are very true. Don't get me wrong, the I30 is very sporty is it's manners and is faster to 60mph then the Lexus ES300 by about half a second.  
The I30 is a great car and should be considered if you're in the market for an entry-level luxury car. And don�t fall into the common mistake that most do, in thinking that the I30 and the Maxima are identical. They are two completely different vehicles and each should be looked at carefully, either way you go, you can�t go wrong.
