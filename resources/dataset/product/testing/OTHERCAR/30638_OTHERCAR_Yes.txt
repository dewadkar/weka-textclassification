            After reading many reviews on this camera and intense comparison of other manufacturers, I bought the CL50 about six months ago.  Although the features are many, you need to spend ample time reading the manual and playing with the settings to become familiar with the operation.  Once accustomed, this digital gives clear images with many different pixel combinations, even black and white.  The software included for uploading to your P.C. is also very easy to use.  Four AA batteries are needed to operate the camera, and the camera pouch has a handy slot to store extra sets.  The auto shut off does preserve your battery life, but I do recommend getting the AC adapter just in case.  Overall, I believe that this is a quality digital, easy to use and well worth the price<br><br>
