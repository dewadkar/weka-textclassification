            I have taken 3000 pictures with this camera and haven't had a problem yet. all teh pictures come out clean and clear, the lcd display shows the picture immeadiatly after you take the picture and the playback feature is astoundingly fast,  definatly the fastest i have seen so far, the wait is so short i hardly notice it. Only one problem though, the transfer rates. I take a lot if pictures, so naturaly i wanted to get a better memory card than the one included with the camera(4 megs) i found a card that would hold 16 megs for about 30 bucks and i was pretty happy, so that night i went to a party and took around 600 pictures of friends and strangers doing all sorts of things.(it was a rave in sf. btw) i came home the next morning, and put fresh batteries into my camera and attempted to download the pictures into my computer, to my suprise it took so long that the new batteries ran out of juice! i didnt get a single picture, and had to start alll over again. it was terrible, i had to spend about 4 hours to transfer all the pictures, and ran through 2 sets of batteries. if you do get this camera enjoy, and make sure to get the ac adapter, you'll be glad you did.<br><br>
