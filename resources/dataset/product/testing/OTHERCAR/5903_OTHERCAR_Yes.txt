            Well I guess one of the reasons I am writing this, is not only because I love my dodge, but also because I have been reading alot about how people are not very happy with this truck. I have been reading alot about brake,fluids, load, cruise control problems. i dont know if some of you people got yourself a lemon or not, but I have not had any of these problems with mine, the only flaw it has, is it's a gas hog, but it's also an 8 cyclinder, so you can kind of expect that.Well as far as the tire traction, mine does the same thing on wet roads, but my treads are getting low also, I have discovered that some factory installed tires are really low quality because they buy them in such mass quanities to get them cheaper. This truck has been very dependable, it does'nt use fluids, I've had 2000 lb. loaded in mine and the only thing I noticed was the front end drifted allittle, but that can be expected with that much weight in it. The seats are very comfortable, it is very roomy, the heater and defrost work fast, and it feels very solid when driving down the road, and not to mention its a great looking truck. The factory instlled stereo system is awesome, mine came with a 6 disk CD changer under the middle seat and a 300 watt amp under the passenger seat, you can crank it and it wont distort a bit. So give this truck a chance. For all of you that have had so many problems with yours, I think you have a lemon, and if you dealer wont take care of the problems for you find another dealer, they can take care of warrentee work at any Dodge dealer you dont have to take it to where you bought it. If you bought it used, well it could be how it was treated by the previous owner. Great Truck I would recommend it to any one.
