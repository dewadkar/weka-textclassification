            Six Years ago I purchase a 1994 Green Dodge Shadow with 3 actual miles on it.  It is now the year 2001 and it has long since been paid for.  This Christmas season on returning home from my mothers house the car's mileage rolled over the 200,000 mark.  

This is the best car that I have ever owned.  I come from a long line of Dodge believers and you can not beat this car.  I have had no major trouble with this vehicle. It has trudged through snow, sleet, rain storms, and the hot humid summers of Iowa.  I can not impress upon you enough that this has been a grand vehicle... It just keeps on going.  It reminds me of the Energizer Bunny commercials. 

I drive about 100 miles a day round trip to and from work.  It has never left me stranded and being a non-mechanical person that is a trusting feeling to always make it home with all those miles on its moter.  

I must also confess to you that being a woman and not very mechanical, I have not always been as faithful with the oil changes and stuff like that so some of the things that I would like to share with you are that after 6 years and 200,000 miles it is still going strong with ALL of the original motor parts, belts, fuel system, etc.  The only mechanical things that have been replaced are a small round gasket in the valve cover gasket, the rear brake assembly and the rear view mirror.  Not too shabby as far as I am concerned. Of course the plugs, wires and stuff like that have been changed on a regular basis, but overall this is the best car on the market for the price.  

I know that it is not as pretty as it was on day one, but with 3 kids and places to go,kids to be picked up, back and forth to work, and all the grocery store runs this has been the best investment that could have been made for my family.  I would recommend this car to anyone.

It is a small, economical vehicle that is still sporty looking and has a good pick up and go on the highway.  This little green machine is even cool enough for my 16 year old daughter to cruise around town in.  If you are looking for a good car that will out last the others on the road, then the Shadow is the way to go.  

Happy Car Hunting and rememeber to check out the Dodge Shadow because you can not beat the reliability of this fabulous car!!
