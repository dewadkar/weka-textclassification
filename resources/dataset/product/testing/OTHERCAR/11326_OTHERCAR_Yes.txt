            This is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of Jaguar engineering.  It is just wonderful to look at, the sweet curves, Jaguar grill, and awesome interior.  If you have the money and pick a different car, you should be ASHAMED!!!

Typical Jaguar performance.  This car is very responsive, quick, and sporty.  The XK8 is a real head turner, and will draw attention wherever you go.  The car is filled with a V8 engine capable of going from 0-60 in a very impressive 6.7 seconds.  

Perhaps the best thing about all Jaguars are there grand interiors.  All Jags are filled with walnut trims, leather, and are just as luxurious as they are beautiful.  There is also adequate room for adults in the front, something some sports cars lack.  

If you have the money and want a relaxing, yet exciting ride to work, this car is for you.  When the roof is down, you'll be amazed at how happy this car will make you.  <br><br>
