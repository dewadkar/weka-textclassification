            I purchased my 2002 Trailblazer in July of 2001 in Vermont. Before winter hit the windshield wipers started to intermittently stop working before all together failing. I had the motor replaced and away I went. On the week before Thanksgiving 2002 the wipers failed again in a rainstorm in Plattsburgh, New York. Again back to the dealers which they replaced the motor again. A week after moving down to North Carolina I had the reverse problem with the wipers, after setting the control to low speed I could not slow or stop the windshield wipers without shutting of the engine. I called GM on their hotline which was located in the back of all the GM manuals, and asked them why and when this problem would be resolved.  They were trained right to say nothing but "We just want to help you solve the problem at hand". After arguing with them for 25 minutes, I conceded and Delivered it the the local GM dealership(Hendrix Chevrolet. It Was friday afternoon and I told them I needed it back for monday morning. Saturday afternoon I heard nothing so I called and they said they were working on the heat/cool problem that they could not seem to reproduce. After fighting with 2 managers to get a rental that they were to provide and I didn't get. I drove the vehicle home.

I decided to trade the Trailblazer in and after reading the reviews on this website. I bought a car (Infiniti G35 Sedan)and now I'm not worried about driving something that might leave my wife stranded.

Other Problems encountered in mine. Unbearable noise when just the rear windows are open. Bad gas mileage (Averaging 16 mpg), and poor cornering ability as all SUVs.The motor idle was high at cold starts, and it felt that the automatic transmisson would hold up through the years(The wife said before trading it in that the transmission was shifting funny). I received a bad trade in due to the incentives on new GM products available now.

I felt it important to write this since I bought my car through commits form others and reviews from auto magazines.

PS: A friend of mine also has a trailblazer and he complains about the feeling of the rear while driving.

I might of gotten  the lemon. Thats why I only gave it a below average review,  but at least their are some things to look out for while test driving a Trailblazer

Good luck in your vehicle purchase!!!
