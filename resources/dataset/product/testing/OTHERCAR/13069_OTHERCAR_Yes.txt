            To live with a 1988 Trooper is really about pros and cons. Which is why most of the time people either love it or hate it. With a Trooper you can get a reliable, inexpensive, and usable vehicle. But you will also get a slow, gas sucking, poor handling, and by todays and the day that it was built's standard, a primitive piece of machinery. The simplicity of the Trooper can work in your favor if you maintain your own car. It is very easy to repair, and because of its ground clearance you can often get away with not using jack stands. Many parts for the Trooper are available rebuilt or used. The interior is large and has few protrusions. It has a fairly simple, part-time four wheel drive system so not much can go wrong,though sometimes the automatic hubs die. Everything about this model year trooper is simple and cheap. The perfect example is the glove box hinge. It is a plastic flap that bends at a seam. You would think this wouldn't hold up at all, but its still working on my car. The structure of the car is a frame on chassis design which is strong but will flex and make noise. If you are looking for a utilitarian truck with personality the Trooper may be for you. If things like being the last car to leave the 
stop light, and not living in the Twentieth century when you are in your car really bug you then you may hate the Trooper.  <br><br>
