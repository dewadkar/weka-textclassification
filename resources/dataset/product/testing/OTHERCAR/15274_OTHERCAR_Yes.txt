            My husband and I purchased this camera as a Christmas gift for ourselves last year.  I don't think any digital camera can beat it.  Pictures are stored directly to a floppy disk so there is no need to purchase expensive cards and then having the hassle of transferring them to disk.  Pictures are wonderful.  We print ours out on the Hewlett Packard DeskJet 712C on premium photo paper and when framed you can't tell the difference between the digital pictures and that of a 35MM.

I have enjoyed using it to make my own copies of old heirloom photos.  The black and white ones turn out wonderful and then you don't have to worry about damaging the original during framing or scrapbooking.

Also, with a new baby in the family the digital camera has allowed us the opportunity to keep all of our relatives and friends supplied with updated photos!!

It is awesome for emailing pictures and best of all you don't have to wait a week for processing.  Although there is an online option for digital processing that I have yet to try!<br><br>
