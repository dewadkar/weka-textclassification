            BMW has finally added and addition to their line that really makes them look really good.  REALLY good.  The M5 brings power and luxury to a new level.

The M5 is a really nice car.  They have packed a 400 horsepower engine and a six-speed transmission into a car that brings luxury to a higher level.

The engine roars.  Actually, it would be closer to a purr.  For the size of the engine, and the actual speed the car goes, it is a very quiet engine.  The steering is superb.  It seems to react more to your thoughts than your actions.  With a six-speed manual transmission, the M5 can reach speeds you never thought possible, also the transimisson is very easy to handle without much groaning.

The inside is very good.  It raises the bar of luxury.  You can slip into the seat of the car and live there.  The leather of the seats seem to engulf you slowly as you sit there pondering how fast you can go without the cops catching you.  The Cd player and sound is very nice (it would have to be nice for the price you pay for the actual car.)  Amazingly enough, the backseat is fairly comfortable, but with three people slightly crowded.

This is a great car that is worth buying despite the really high price.
