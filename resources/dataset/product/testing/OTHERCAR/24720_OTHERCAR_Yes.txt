            Don't expect to get professional results with this camera but for its range of price, this product is simply amazing and not too far from being perfect. When reading this review, keep in mind I'm trying to be picky since I've been using it for a while and I'm a familiar with its use.

I bought the S70 about ten months ago and I've shot a lot of different types of pictures with it: its pretty light weight and compact size as well as its ease of use make the perfect digital camera for me. The camera has a Carl Zeiss lens and I was really impressed by the quality of its pictures (colors, shades, contrast...) although I've read a pretty bad review about it in a magazine. If you're concerned about the size of this camera compare to the Sony DSC-P1 that has the same price, keep in mind that the latter doesn't have this lens and it really makes a difference.

As many other digital cameras, there is a whole bunch of nice features such as crop/resize a picture (no matter what resolution was your picture, when you crop it, it goes down to 640x480), the ability to choose from 6 different resolutions (320x240... 2048x1536), zoom in a picture (to look for a specific detail for instance), USB connection to your PC (which is a lot faster), optical and digital zoom (even though I don't recommend using the digital one unless you don't move at all), several effects (sepia, black and white, solarize, negative and two or three others), a viewfinder with a focus ring (very convenient at night, believe me, you can't see anything using the LCD)... and 7 different exposure modes. The "night plus" one is really amazing: if you can stand still and use it at night, the results are really impressive. I've taken very nice pictures of San Francisco under the moon light for instance. People around me couldn't believe they were shot with a digital camera. That's just an example of an exposure mode, but that should give you a pretty good idea of its quality.

You can even shoot a movie with it! It's handy but can't replace a camcorder. In fact, you have to choose between three recording times: 5, 10 or 15 sec. Once it's chosen and you start recording, you can't stop it. But the really annoying thing is you can't use the zoom. However, I must say the High Quality mode is pretty nice. I guess you're not going to buy this digital camera for its movie function. So let's just say this feature may be useful.

So why only 4 stars? Well, first because it comes with an 8Mb memory stick (come on Sony! we can't do anything with 8Mb unless we use the 640x480 resolution!). To give you an example, you can only store a couple of pictures using the maximum resolution. Furthermore, there is no carrying case or something to protect it and the menu is not that intuitive... it can get pretty complicated to find what you're looking for when you don't know your camera. Once you're used to it, it's a little more user friendly. You also have to know that the driver is not compatible with Windows 2000. For those of you using this OS, you'll have to go to the Sony website to download it and I've heard a few complaints around me about the installation process. To be honest, I'm a Windows98 user and not too concerned about that but I thought you should know. One last thing: I was describing the quality of the exposure modes earlier, but I should also say a word about how slow it is to focus on a subject. Don't try to take pictures during a sport event for instance, unless maybe you really know how to deal with the shutter speed and aperture. Keep in mind that you can't really do anything to change the "manual" settings.

However, once again, the camera is extremely easy to use... turn it on, point and shoot... delete if you're not satisfied and try again! Want to have a look at your pictures? Turn a switch to "play mode" and use the arrows of a small d pad to navigate among them, either one by one or in an index mode that allows you to select more than one picture at a time. Then you just have to delete, resize... and just plug your USB connector to your PC and with the driver installed, a removable disk appears on your desktop, just like a zip drive or a hard drive! Drag and drop your pictures where you want. The InfoLithium rechargeable battery allows you to know exactly how much time you have left. I consider the battery life to be very good: around 150 minutes with the LCD display on. You can turn it off if you need extra battery life.

In short, I really think the S70 is worth the price you pay for it even if you'll have to buy another memory stick (around $140 for a 64Mb and I suggest you don't buy a smaller one - a 128Mb should be available on the market pretty soon). It has all the features of the other digital cameras of its range of prices plus others, the quality of the picture is commendable (and again I'm not talking about the 3.3 megapixels resolution which is obviously excellent but about the colors, contrast...) and it's easy to use, except for the menu at first. I've used it in trade shows, parties with friends, during weekends (sceneries...), I've even taken some pictures from a plane! I convinced a few of my friends to buy one when they saw the results. And if you use a good color printer (mine is an Epson) and the high resolution, the result is really stunning. Do not hesitate, buy it!
