            I owned the most wonderful, 2-door red Acura when my husband and I first married.  Never had a problem.  When my first son was born we felt we had to trade the Acura for a 4-door vehicle so that his car seat would fit in the back seat.

My husband surprised me with a used (6 months old, 18,000 miles) Chrysler Concorde.  It was beautiful.  Fully loaded, leather seats and all.  I loved the way it drove.  It was very comfortable.

A couple of months after we owned the car the emergency brake got stuck in permanent lock position.  We couldn't do anything to get it off.  We were stranded with out baby in a parking lot.   I WAS SOOO ANGRY, but these things sometimes happen.  The car was still under the manufacturer's warranty and we purchased an additional 100,000-mile warranty so were we certain it would be covered.  WRONG...  $350.00 to replace the whole unit on top of the cost of towing and renting a car for 2 days.  

Over the next 2 1/2 years multiple things went wrong until at 59,000 miles....  I was driving to Toys R Us with my 3 year old and my 6-month-old son. The steering went out COMPLETELY as I was about to enter the freeway.  We were graced that day that nothing happened to us.  We had the car towed to the dealership and they said it was the water pump that had gone out.  I thought, a water pump, how much could that cost.  Well, the water pump sprayed water all over the engine and now it needed a new engine.  I told some of my co-workers about this and found that two other people with the same year and model of car had THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  (My brother-in-law, who had the same car, also had the emergency brake problem).

I did love this car when it didn't have problems but it was a money pit and I'm Sooooooooo glad to be rid of it now.

I hope that if you're planning on buying a used Concorde you'll read this and be warned as no one warned me!!!!
