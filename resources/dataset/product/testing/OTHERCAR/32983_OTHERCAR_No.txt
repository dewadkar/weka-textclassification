            My My family recently purchased a Toyota Camry because for its outstanding reputation.  Its true, the Camry has one of the best reputations in the auto world today for value and reliability.  However, it has absolutely no reputation for comfort or performance.  When purchasing a Camry it is important to weigh performance vs. economy.

The Camry is one of the most economical cars on the market.  The gas mileage is superior.  The maintenance costs are minimal.  The Camry is the choice if youï¿½re looking for a low maintenance, reliable car.  

Unfortunately the Camry lacks the power of most other cars of its class on the market.  Sure it does fine for trips to the grocery store and down to the mall, but on open country roads the driver is left looking for a little more performance.  The handling is also lacking compared to the cars on the same market.  There is a lot of sway in the cornering which makes the Camry feel more like a Caddy than a light sub compact.  Also the stock tires are not built for performance and squeal at low g's.  Overall the performance is disappointing at best.

The ride is average for a car of this size.  The interior noise level is not bad, but could be improved.  The seats are comfortable, and supportive.  The back seats are comfortable for two adults, but can be cramped if the passenger and drivers seats are pushed back.  Also, the standard radio is weak at best.  Although the highs and lows are crisp, the mids are simply not there.  Overall I would say the interior of this car feels economical.

For the money, (approx. 22,000) the Camry is a good choice.  If you are looking for the reliability of Japanese Engineering, are not interested in performance, and not looking to spend a lot of money the Camry is a good car.  However, if you are looking for performance, (both in engine and ride) there are better cars on the market.
