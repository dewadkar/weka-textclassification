            My wife and I bought a Grand Prix GT about 2,000 miles ago. We were looking for a sporty family car that is fun to drive. We took the SE for a ride and we both liked it and were thinking about buying it. Then the salesman invited us to take the GT for a ride. We immediately loved it, this is a sharp car inside and out. It has powerful performance, handling, and styling plus it gets 30 MPG on the highway. What's not to like? 

This is how I rate this car on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the best)

Exterior: 8
This car doesn't stand out like a Viper but it is very sharp looking. I immediately noticed the 16 inch low profile tires on aluminum wheels, dual exhaust that's a little throaty, and clean lines.

Interior: 8.5
The interior is fairly roomy, quiet, and comfortable. I'm 6' tall and I need to adjust the seat so that my head doesn't hit the roof but the car is a sleek design and my shorter wife likes the seat higher. The dashboard has information on everything you need to know about and then some. The dash display is white lettering in the daylight but turns to red illuminated lettering at night. Even the power locks and window switches are red at night which makes them easy to find and doesn't bother your night vision. The shifter and steering wheel are covered in leather and there is nothing cheap about the interior.

Engine: 10
The GT comes with the 3.8 Liter V6. It's powerful and responsive and I think this engine has a reliable track record. The reason I give this a 10 is because with all it's power there is no way that it should be able to get 20 MPG city and 30 MPG highway.

Handling: 8
It handles like a sports car with a tight suspension. It definitely isn't a Cadillac ride, you feel the bumps in the road, but it corners beautifully. Although it's great on the highway, the real fun is when you get on curvey country roads. The variable power steering works flawlessly and makes you feel like you have total control of the car at all times. I haven't used them but the 4 wheel disk ABS and automatic traction control (both standard) should help in emergency situations. 

Features: 10
It comes with a lot of standard features; power, air, auto, etc. The car we chose also has a driving computer (MPG, miles left on the tank, gallons used, etc.), steering wheel radio controls, a compass and thermometer integrated into the auto dimming rear view mirror, power everything, and On*Star. My wife loves the safety of On*Star which is a built in cell phone and GPS system. Push a button and it dials an On*Star operator who you talk to hands-free (it uses the radios speakers and a microphone). If she locks her keys in the car she can call a toll-free number, provide information and a pin, and On*Star will send a signal that will unlock her doors. If she looses it in the mall parking lot they can even set off her alarm so that she can find it. She'll most likely never need this but it makes her feel safer.

Value: 9
With everything you get, I think low 20's is a reasonable price. I did a lot of shopping and research and when I weighed everything this is the car I felt was my best value. I saw comparisons of cars that outperform or do something better but at a cost of $10 K to 15 K more.
