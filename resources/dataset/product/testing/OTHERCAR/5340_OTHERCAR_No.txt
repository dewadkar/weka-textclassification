            We found ourselves in the used-car market following a rear-end collision.  Our 1994 Ford Aerostar was totaled and we could not replace it with a newer model as this vehicle had been discontinued.

After much conversation with auto mechanics and used-car buyers/owners we zeroed in on the Chrysler product line.  We chose a Chrysler product because we believed it would be a solidly built, long-lasting vehicle. We purchased it at a &quot;5 star&quot; dealership because we believed we would get a better vehicle at a better price and receive better service when we needed it.

1996 Grand Voyager SE Pros and Cons - The features that &quot;sold us&quot; on the vehicle were the dual sliding doors, rear captains chairs and the rear air conditioning.  The Infinity audio system w/CD is also a nice feature.  The vehicle drives more like a sedan than a truck which was, initially, also a plus.  However, it also &quot;feels&quot; more like a sedan.  It is not &quot;solid&quot; like the minivans built on a truck chassis.  Additionally, there are some features that drive me absolutely nuts - two in particular - the automatic door locks and the rear tailgate.  

The doors lock automatically once the vehicle reaches a consistent speed of 25+ mph.  When you then park the car at your destination and get out by simply pulling the handle, the driver door opens, but the automatic locks do not disengage - thus making it very easy to lock your keys in the vehicle!!!  Additionally, only the driver door allows you to pull the handle to get out without having to first unlock the door - trapping other passengers in the vehicle until the driver remembers to unlock the doors.  Finally, as a busy mom, I am forever frustrated when I forget this fact, jump out of the car, go around to the passenger side to get out my children, or to the tailgate to get my groceries, only to find that I have &quot;failed&quot; to unlock the doors making it necessary for me to go back to my door to start the process over.  I realize that some of this would be alleviated by reprogramming the driver (myself) to automatically unlock the doors when I come to a stop.

The tailgate swings very wide and high.  It also &quot;locks&quot; into the open position so well that it is hard/awkward to close.

However, even these negative features are not the reason I would never again purchase this vehicle or recommend it to friends.  No.  The reason I would never again purchase a Chrysler product is a direct result of the means by which our vehicle was delivered and finally as a direct result of the incredibly poor service we have received, from the dealership - AutoWest Chrylser/Dodge/Plymouth/Jeep in Roseville, CA - when required, since the time of purchase.

Why?  We have had our vehicle in for servicing twice (by the way - we bought the warranty)and both times our experience has been the same.  Getting through to the service department is difficult - you must endure a seemingly endless maze of automated telephone prompts before you get to a real person.  Once you reach the service department, getting through to someone other than the receptionist is another challenge.  When you do finally reach a service representative they are often rude and slow to respond.  Both times the service has taken twice as long as expected.  The last time we were there, our vehicle was held for one full day before there was even an attempt made to receive a warranty &quot;authorization to repair&quot;.  After two days, when I went to retrieve my &quot;repaired&quot; vehicle, I was given the keys and when I got in I discovered it had not been reassembled properly and I had to send it back to the shop before I could drive it home...though they seemed perfectly content to return it to me in obvious &quot;disrepair&quot;.  If this is &quot;5 star&quot; service...I shudder to think what kind of service you get for &quot;1 star&quot;!  In my book, they rate NO stars!!!<br><br>
