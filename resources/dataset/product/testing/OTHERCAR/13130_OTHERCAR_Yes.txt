            I bought this vehicle simply because I like big &quot;boat&quot; like cars which are comfortable.  I also had a sizeable GM card rebate due to me.  I bought my 99 Lumina for $13,200 after my rebate.

This car feels and drives big.  My father in law often calls it my &quot;boat&quot; even though he drives a Blazer.  The car is pretty basic transportation, but can get fancy with aded options.  It has a soft ride that wallows and makes me sea sick with continous bottoming out.  

A sports car this is not... Don't expect any special handling or slalom performances out of this one....  It's best use is a midnight trip to Wal-Mart to get your children some cough medicine, or a company outing to a lunch.

If you like comfortable bouncy rides and a overall soft gentle feel from a car, this is the one for you.<br><br>
