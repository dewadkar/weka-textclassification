            This is another car owned by my grandparents.  You didn�t expect them to drive their Cadillac every where do you? The Saturn SL2 was purchased to replace my 95 Buick because My grandmother did not think that car was �sporty enough� for her.  Great, I was driving a car that even My grandmother did not think was sporty...no wonder I could not get dates.  Luckily I do get the chance to drive the Saturn quite often.

Basically the Saturn is a small economy car and that role shows through with the interior. First the bad.  The back seat is only comfortable for two young children.  Don�t even think of putting a six-foot tall person back there unless you want a lawsuit for cruel and unusual punishment.  The bottom seat cushion is shaped so that pasengers will not "submarine" (sinking into the seat under the seat belt) in a collision.  The front seat is near ideal with outstanding seat comfort and driving position.  The driver�s side seat does get a manual height adjustment but I have found you need to be outside the car to raise the seat.  The seat fabrics themselves seem to hold up well but will not win any luxury awards.  The same goes for the use of hard plastic through out the interior.  Passengers and drivers may wish for more padded surfaces to lean against.  

Our SL2 has a black dash board which combines with the large front window to create quite a greenhouse effect in the summer.  Worse is that it is hard to find sunshades that will fit.  Needless to say that during the hot summers here in Texas the interior can get EXTREMELY HOT!  Thankfully the air conditioner does a great job at cooling things off.  One annoyance is that the A/C continually blows on the windshield no matter what the setting.  On numerous occasions this has caused the base of the windshield to fog and block sight lines.  

Mechanically the car performs adequately.  The engine, in SL2 form, provides strong acceleration for a small car and only sips regular gas.  While I drive the car often I have not had a chance to measure fuel economy.  I am guessing that mid to high 20�s is what we get in mostly city driving.  The ride of this car is smooth on the highway but gets a little choppy in the city.  The car does inpart a feeling of security without feeling small though.  It seems to me that the suspension/steering settings are not quite up to the sporty image of the car. When pushed the Saturn loses its composure.  

The reliability of the car has been exceptional so far.  Aside from one power window that failed early on it has not had a repair visit to he dealer.  I am not saying that no annoyances have crept up.  After three years and 30,000 miles this car has become quite �buzzy�.  The engine and dash are the two trouble spots.  The engine itself is quite course and the plastic in the dash area vibrates along with it.  If you are shopping for this car take a long test drive to be sure this is acceptable to you.  I have found it very tiring on long trips.   One last gripe is the wipers.  While they do a fair job at clearing the windshield, thy leave quite a bit of un-wiped area at the top.  It is sort of like wearing a ball cap too low.  

In review, the Saturn is a good car but then so is several other small cars in the same price range. For those who want to buy American it remains a solid choice.  When stacked up against competitors from Japan it feels out classed.  

UPDATE:

It happened to me yet again.  In August 2001 a truck ran a red light and pulled right oput in front of me.  Boom. When everything was done the 85 chevy truck was totaled and the Saturn had a dent on the hood and a broken head light.  The seat belts worked and the air bags did not deploy.  I think my speed at impact was slightly under air bag threshold.  I was very impressed.  The engine did not even die during the collision. I was even able to drive the car at highway speeds without any problems afterward.  Saturns ability ward off damage while protecting its occupants was demonstrated a week later as I drove home.  Seems that another SL2 sedan was sandwiched between a Honda Civic (in front) and a Izuzu truck (behind).  YThe Honda had noticable bumper damage and the Izuzu looked ready for the salvage yard. The only damage I saw on the Saturn was a slightly deformed rear Bumper cover.  Compared to other cars Saturns have won my loyalty with this performance.
