            We were looking for an economical car that is also affordable, and roomy for a friend of ours.  The 2003 Chicago Auto Show debut, and what a way to check out ALL the cars that may match his needs!  And so, we were off!

Hybrid cars are great on gas, but still pricy, even after the government incentives.  At $20k and up, there is no way my friend was going to pony up that much.  They are also relatively small for him, as he is a large guy.  Affordable, economical, and lots of room.  That's a hard bill to fit.  So we also looked at the traditional "gas" cars.

At first, compact cars were not on our minds.  We checked out the Subaru Outback wagon, and found it very room, though still pricy at $25k.  The Hyundai Santa Fe was room and comfy, but costed $21k.  Still expensive for him (though we thought that was a pretty good MSRP).  The gas mileage was awesome at 29 MPG HWY.  And keep in mind this was an SUV!

The car that fit the bill was the least likeliest, as we wandard around and ended up in Suzuki's display area.  We were looking for small, roomy, and economical SUVs from them.  Small SUVs should be economical, and the size of SUVs should be roomy enough.  But we still haven't found anything to replace the Hyundai Santa Fe.  But then, we stepped inside of the Aerio GS sedan on display.  There was also an Aerio SX wagon that looked sportier, but for some reason, my friend says it seems a little more cramped than the sedan.

As for the sedan, whoa, it fits like a glove!  Coming from my friend's mouth, that says alot!  We all decided to pile in the car with him in the driver's seat, and found that we all can fit inside comfortably for an hour or two (though, we would be stupid to do so during the show!).

We found out that the price was $12.5k for the S model, which has almost every standard feature you may want!  Not bad considering the price tag.  Power windows, locks, AC, and CD player usually never comes into play at this price tag, but the info guy assured us that it was in the Aerio S (which is the most basic Aerio trim they have).

<b>Exterior</b>

What an odd looking car.  It reminds me of the Toyota Prius, with the small looking tires, and a tall roof line.  But in reality, the rims are 15", and can be fitted with 17" without a problem (or so says the info guy).  Thanks to the tall roof line, the interior has lots of headroom (but more on that later).

It's a cute looking car - almost toy-like.  Even though this is Suzuki's only car in their auto line (they are all SUVs, jeeps, and the like), the styling is unmistakenably Suzuki.  This is more appearant in the rear, with the very Suzuki-looking tail lights.  Other than that, it looks very plain (actually more plain looking than the Prius).

<b>Interior</b>

This is the most important for all of us.  Hey, if we were going to sit in it, we better damn well enjoy it!  The tallness of the car allowed a lot of headroom.  This is one of a few cars that gave my friend a few inches of breathing room from the top of his head (and without a sun roof!).  Everyone benefits from this!  Even the rear passengers!  However, when the rear passengers sits back, your head may meet the roof slighty, as it angles towards the back.

The stereo is well placed in an area that you just can't miss!  It's a full din-sized appliance that is very accessable.  You literally just can't miss it because it just sits there and looks almost out of place.  On top of the AM/FM CD-Player with cassette is the clock, so everyone can see it.

The climate control is the only thing that was not positioned ergonimically.  It was placed so low, it may intefere with driving when you just need the right temperature to warm you up, or cool you off.  The dials are easy to operate, as there are large, and shows up in the usual "temp/fan" pair.

The futuristic digital gauges are cool too look at, but as with most digital gauges, seem to refresh slowly.  We are too used to constantly moving analog gauges.  It is still very easy to read, with an amber display and a large digital spedo.  The dash is symetrical, and was done so on purpose for easy conversion to different countries with different driving sides.  (Actually, that's us!  Because normally, this car is right hand drive in Japan).

Creature conforts are minimal.  The seats are softer than most (Subaru's hard grippy seats did not float his boat), and because of this, does not grip well.  This is fine for a daily driver, of course.  You don't want yor butt aching after a long drive.  There are very little cubbies.  Cup holders for the front holds two, but will block the HAV controls.  The rear only gets one cup holder located in the center, but that is more than some other cars we've experienced.

However, trying to operate all of these things, including power door locks and windows, you can feel the cheap lightness of plastic.  There is no weight to anything, and may have probably contributed to the sub 2000 lbs curb weight.  It's actually around 1800 lbs!

The rear seats provide very little extra confort, but still suitable.  With three passengers in the back, it gets cramped laterally, but as long as everyone keeps their hands to themselves, it's fine. :)

Trunk space is very spacious for such a small car!  It has much more room than our current Toyota Tercel.

Overall, the controls, the feel, and the conforts are a minimalistic's dream come true.

<b>Power</b>

The Aerio impressed us so much that we decided that we HAD to know how it felt on the road.  With 145 hp @ 5700 RPM, and 136 lb/ft of torque @ 3000 RPM, I would consider exessive for such a small, lightweight car.  My 2700 lb Sentra is considered peppy with a 145 hp engine, so I just can't imagine what the Aerio would be like with the same amount of power!

I didn't have to anymore, when wisked away from stop.  Flooring it gave the sensation that the tires were slipping, asking for more weight for more traction!  (And this is an automatic!).

Gas mileage was pretty good at 26 MPG city and 32 MPG highway.  It's the best we've seen in a petrol-only vehicle.  But it's simply amazing given the power it produces!

Just the same, handling in around town driving is simply amazing.  Thanks to it's petite size, it turns on a dime, and maintains sure footed.  However, high winds will cause this car to squirm.

As good as all of this is, this is not an auto crossing car.  There is lots of front-end dive during braking, and understeers during high speed corners.  The instant the rear drum brakes are enganged (for a split second), the tail end will start fishtailing, thanks to the lightweight.  Don't try this at home, kids!

But just because the body rolls, that doesn't mean the car isn't tossable!  This is more for fun and show than for true "must-wring-out-every-little-tenth-of-a-second" auto crossing vehicle.

Of course, the Aerio as is may lend itself well to aftermarket modifications and parts.  However, sadly, Suzuki Aerio's are not as popular as Civics, so don't hold your breath.

BUT, as a daily driver (as most of us are), this is a car that you should consider - especially if you are tall AND/or wide!
