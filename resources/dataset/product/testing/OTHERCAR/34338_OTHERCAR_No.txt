            A Ten year old buick century has its pitfalls but a new one is good for the business person. When a Buick Century reaches its ninth and tenth year it begins to lose the ability to travel over a speed of seventy five miles per hour without shaking. The under carriage of the car rusts easier and is less likely to last in a salty environment. Thus the recommendation to 'lose the car at ten years.' Please don't wait. If possible trade it in at five years and avoid purchasing a used one over five years old. However, if you are one to travel on business then this car would be perfect. It's performance for breaking well, anti-look breaks, and its small engine gives it a uniquely gratifying feel.

A 1981 Buick Century has its seatbelts in the doors, which is not a very safe feature, with comfortable seats. If purchasing this type of vehicle be sure that the seatbelts are either in the seat itself or in the door frame. This will help to increase safety, a 1995 or younger vehicle should do.    

If you want a good car that lasts a long time in salty or cold environments get an Eagle Premier. This car can last at least 10 to 15 years, used.  <br><br>
