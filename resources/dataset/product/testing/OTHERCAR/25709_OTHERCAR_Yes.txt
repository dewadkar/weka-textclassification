            I bought my 1995 Nissan Pathfinder SE 4x4 about a year ago.  It is completely loaded, with 31&quot; tires, the SE sport package, and power everything.  It is a wonderful vehicle off-road.  I have tried unsuccessfully to get it stuck in everything from mud to snow.  I have heard that the XE and LE pathfinders don't fare nearly as well as the SE off-road, which makes sense- the SE has the beefed-up suspension, adjustable shocks, and 31&quot; off-road tires.  I have had a couple of mechanical glitches in my year of ownership.  Pathfinders are apparently *notorious* for breaking the studs that hold the exhaust manifolds on the engine.  Not a major mechanical problem, but in order to get the broken studs out, they have to be drilled out of the motor.  The manifolds weren't cracked, but due to the labor involved, the repair cost me almost $800, and I've been told by other pathfinder owners that the fix is only good for about 60,000 miles, which is exactly the mileage mine had on it when I first noticed the problem.  Aside from that, my pathfinder has been dead solid reliable.  No pit stops at the dealer other than recommended maintenance (which can be a bit pricey on this model).  I am a short person, so it is more than adequately roomy for me and my family, and if I had to find something to complain about with it, I would have to say that I wished the V6 had either a) better gas mileage, or b) about 40 more horsepower.  The engine has 180 ft/lbs. of torque, which makes up for the lack of horsepower.  I have noticed that my automatic transmission has begun to shift into second gear a little less smoothly than it used to, but it is still quite smooth overall.  If I had to buy my SUV all over again, I'd purchase it without thinking twice about it.<br><br>
