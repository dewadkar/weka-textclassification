            We bought the Fuji Finepix 1400 last December as a family Christmas present.  Just before Christmas, selections were getting thin in the stores, a factor that worked to my advantage.  

I had just about settled on another brand at a higher price, but broadened my search to Fuji after reading opinions online.  Unable to find the camera locally, I located a best price online from Shop 4 Digital in New York.  The camera was $258.00 with a bundled charger and four rechargeable batteries.  Shipping was $19.95.  On the phone with the vendor, I agreed to add an expensive memory card, 16MB for $49.99.  That's where they made their money.  Memory can be had a lot cheaper.

The memory cards are easily removed for loading in my computer by means of a floppy adapter.  I subsequently added three extra memory cards, so I could keep different subjects on different cards.  The floppy adapter cost me an additional $50.   

The operator's manual is well written and complete, with good illustrations, as you'd expect.  Programming the camera is simple enough, and the controls are well-positioned and easy to manipulate.  As others have observed, the lens cover is not connected to the on-off switch.  A durable  Off/Review/On switch is located on top of the camera.  While I like this feature, I sometimes forget to open the lens cover.  

One unnerving feature of digital photography is the delay between pressing the shutter release and actual exposure.  Unlike a 35MM, it is necessary to hold the Fuji on target for a few seconds after pushing the shutter release.  For a moving object, you need to "follow through".   

The flash is not a pop-up, but is housed in the body of the camera, where it won't be knocked loose as we've observed on cameras with pop-up flash units.  

The camera's USB cable was one of the features that led me to buy.  But we had some difficulty using it.  In fact, we don't use it.  The software was easy enough to install in the computer, but previously installed webcam software wouldn't die--clicking on the Fuji Ikon caused the webcam software to boot.  I don't fault the Fuji product, but rather our (lack of) computer expertise.  

When loading to the computer, you have to be careful not to over-write earlier photos.  Unless you program the document numbers, the camera starts each memory card with the same file name.  I handle that by making a new sub-directory each time I upload to the computer.  

At 1.3 megapixels of resolution, this camera is not for fine portraits.  But its low cost and ease of use rate high with me.  It is thrifty on battery use and with extra memory cards I'm seldom "out of film".  When the batteries are removed for the one-hour charging, the camera reverts to factory settings.  I prefer a lower resolution setting for general use, with files at 43K or 88K, instead of the 330K size at the default setting.  A lower resolution is easier to email.        

The Fuji 1400 is great for family photos, cars, houses, items of interest, even small or close-up items.  It is difficult to hold a camera steady enough to photograph documents, though the optics are adequate for that use.  I've used the Fuji at work, in fact my boss was sufficiently impressed to buy a (more expensive) digital camera for the office.  Outside of work, I find the camera useful for my real estate investments.  

Digital photography is flexible, reproducable, immediate, and, after the initial investment, cheap.  I've learned a lot since I bought the Fuji FinePix 1400.  There are more sophisticated cameras available for more money.  There are simpler cameras available for less.  This one is a nice marriage of capabilities and reasonable cost.  I recommend it for anyone who doesn't require high resolution but wants convenience and ease of use at a reasonable price.
