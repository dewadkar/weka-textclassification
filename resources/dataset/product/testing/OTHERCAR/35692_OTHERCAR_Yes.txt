            While I didn't necessarily agree with my husband's purchase of the Pontiac Bonneville, it was going to primarily be HIS car, therefore I had little to do with his decision. I've been a Ford Taurus wagon owner and driver since purchasing a 1989 model when my son was born. When that one became more expensive to fix than a car payment (!) I decided to replace it with another Taurus wagon. I'm now wondering just how long I can hold out before replacing my plain old Taurus with a car as comfortable and affordably luxurious as this Bonneville!

&quot;Our&quot; Bonneville is a 1998 bonneville SE sedan. What really makes this car, are the options! I always said I hated leather seats in a car, for instance. Getting into the car on a hot day, wearing shorts can be painful! It's not to warm in the Winter either! I'll tell you though, the comfort more than makes up for the temporary discomfort you may experience in extreme temperatures!

The car also has an optional CD player. If you want to hear CD's in my Taurus, we've got to set up the CD car-kit which plugs into the cigarette lighter plug and the cassette player. What a pain! We've used that system on trips to Florida and Ohio, and it was very inconvenient. In the Taurus, we actually have to remove the panel holding the cigarette lighter, in order to access it while we're using the drink console! Not so with the Bonneville, which has the built in player. On our recent trip to Florida, I've only just realized what a convenience that is.I also realized just how comfortable those leather seats are on a long trip. The seats are fully adjustable, front to back and reclineable.

Today I enjoyed the use of the optional power sunroof. Another &quot;luxury&quot; I never felt was worth paying for. Here in NY the climate is quite unpredictable and variable. Wasn't quite warm enough today for the air conditioner, but who wants the windows open on the highway? The airflow through the sunroof is only half as noisy as the open windows, with much less blowing. Perfect for this Spring day!

The final option I feel obliged to mention, is the only one my husband and I still differ on. He thinks the keyless remote entry is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I really think it's dumb. I guess you can form your own opinion! The keyless remote allows you to lock and unlock your doors via a remote on your keychain. There is also a &quot;panic button&quot; on the remote that you can press if you're in trouble. It will start the car horn beeping. I can't tell you how many times that's been pressed accidentally.... The feature that gets under my skin is the little &quot;vanity beep&quot; (as I like to call it) when you lock the doors with the remote. Anyway, my husband loves it!

The main thing I like about this car is that it was extremely comfortable and reliable for our 24 hour drive to Florida, with a family of four. There was more than ample trunk space, with a pass through from the back seat to the trunk. That allowed my daughter to access a cooler that we kept in the trunk, from her seat. Viola! more space in the back seat for the kids! It's a comfortable, roomy sedan that can fit into many family's budgets. If you can pick this one up used, it's certainly worth a second look.
