            Little cars have come a long, long, long way. This is not your father's econocar. With the unforgiving seats, the poor radio, and an engine that made you think you might be able to push the car faster than it could go under its own power. No sir, today's compacts have bigger ego's than ever, and they do their best to fool you into thinking you're in a much more expensive car. The new for 1999 Chevrolet Prizm and its Toyota Corolla twin are among the best at it. 

My friend's car died so he's using his parents' 99 prizm, which I got to spend a little time with. The interior of this car is much improved from previous models. In my parents' 99 Corolla the passengers in the rear or in the front could be comfy but not both at the same time. In this car there was enough space that no one had any complaints, though not much more. Remember, this is still a small car so it's not cavernous inside. But no one was cramped. The front seats provided good lateral and leg support but could have been softer in the middle. All gauges and controls were clearly marked and easy to read. You get pretty much all the instruments you can expect in a car in this class: An engine temp gauge, a fuel gauge, and a speedo. Good enough, though I'd demand a tach if it was a manual.

All radio and climate controls are clearly marked and the buttons are nice and fat, but the radio is below the climate controls, which I don't like. I use the radio more often, so I'd prefer that it sat on top. That radio provided clear quality sound, though being the obnoxious teen that I am I usuaslly think most radios could use deeper, stronger bass and this is no exception.

The interior is very quiet. All you hear is minor engine hum. The sound quality of the engine is much better than previous models. Before at high speeds it became a kind of complaining drone. Here on hard acceleration the snarl is impressive, and then it levels out to a soothing hum.

And that acceleration was impressive. From a stand still it's only a little better than you'd expect, but where this car shines is highway merging and passing. Floor the gas and the first thought that comes into your mind when the 1.8 liter four snarls and the 4-speed automatic downshifts is &quot;did someone play a practical joke on me and put a V6 in my car without telling me?&quot; The 1.8 pulls fiercely at highway speeds and never protests the strain but instead seems to invite it with a goading snarl. We ummm... did not decline a challenge from a 4 cylendar Accord, and the Prizm acquitted itself well. I won't say anymore on that. My parents might be reading. We are talking about a Prizm right?

Ride is excellent, what I expect from much more expensive cars. We never felt the small bumps, we only hear muted 'thwumps' as the suspension absorbed them. The larger ones did affect the cabin, but even then they were never jarring. We'd hit a pothole, and the resultant body motions were taught and well controlled and yet never harsh. We'd go up, we'd go down, and the rebound was barely perceptible.

I think this model had the stabilizer bars at both ends so handling was controlled. Whereas other models I've tried usually understeer heavily, or in other words tuck their noses into the corners, this one was a bit more neutral, and that great suspension prevented mid corner bumps from upsetting its composure. The tail never misbehaved, which I've seen on previous models without the rear stabilizer bar.

Styling: Albeit subjective, but I like it. I live the new prism personally because it is attractive without trying to be 'cute', and I despise cute cars.

Overall, an excellent bargain. Toyota reliability, a comfortable quiet ride, and enough performance that on those days when you feel like a nut it is a willing accomplice. You could of course pay thousands more for a more luxurious vehicle, but in my opinion why bother when you can have so much of that luxury for much less with fewer maintenance headaches?<br><br>
