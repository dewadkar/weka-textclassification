            This is the ultimate luxury/sport sedan.  Without a doubt the BMW M5 is the top sedan in the world today and here's why (speaking as an owner).  The M5 has an eight cylinder engine with a top speed of 250 km/h and oh yes, the 0-100 (km/ph) is a slim 5.3 seconds, not to mention the 396 hp.  Indeed it is one powerful car but you won't hear a thing! 
The beauty does not end there.  The M5 has a spacious comfortable interior, with all the gadgets of a modern day control center for the driver and passenger.  Responsive heating and air conditioning due to excellent ventilation and fan placement add to the overall comfort of the car.
The design itself is worth noting.  Sleek and aerodynamic, the car soars effortlessly with very little wind resistance along the highway, and handles brilliantly in and out of turns through the most compact of urban environments.  Whether cruising or weaving, this machine performs as a masterpiece of automobile innovation.
As long as you've got the money for the purchase, $70 000, and money for gas, enjoy the best in the world of sedans.
