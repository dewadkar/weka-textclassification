            It was 1997 and my brother was moving to Australia.  He needed someone to take over his 1993 Altima payments.  There was one year left on it and I said why not?  He is my brother and I can afford to help him out even though I already have a Honda payment.  Well, five months later the repo man was hunting me down and I finally got tired of running and I handed over the keys to my car.  Yeah, that&#146s right I lost my Altima.  So I never got the full 90s Altima experience.

Well I made up for that when I started selling them.  The 2003 Altima is one of my favorite vehicles out there.  I used to sell a lot of them.  Why? Well when you feel passionate about anything you can sell it and that is how I felt about the Altima.  

Ironically, the 2003 Altima was designed by Nissan with the single male in mind in his 30s maybe early 40s making at least $50K a year.  Well I am in my late 20s, a female and not even close to that salary.  But back to the Altima, previously named for its best in its class and most wanted vehicle.  

<b>CHANGES</b>:
Let&#146s start with all the little and big changes that Nissan made to improve an already beautiful vehicle.  First of all before I even get on that roll, just so you know there are four models: 2.5, 2.5 S, 2.5 SL and 3.5 SE.  Okay now we can get going here.  All of the models now come with a padded arm rest either with cloth, but 2.5 SL has leather as standard.  The really important one is that passenger rear hook they added to hang your dry cleaning on.  Okay, okay, I will be serious now.  Nissan revised their packaging options making it a lot easier to step up as you go sort of sense.  The nicer the model, the more options for packages to come on them.  The 3.5 SE now has 245 horsepower with the 3.5 liter V6 engine.  For you standard transmission lovers out there, do not go with the 2.5 SL, because they all went automatic.  The 2.5 SL stepped up a bit with heated mirrors, heated seats, and wood-tone paneling (which actually doesn&#146t look that tacky at all) all as standard.  However for the 3.5 SE model they are only an option.  Lastly, there are two new colors: Sonoma Sunset and Crystal Blue.  I am sure you have seen both, they are loud colors, I think, on the road.   Nissan discontinued Nouveau Ruby and Opal Blue Metallic, perhaps they weren&#146t real big sellers the year before.  I don&#146t know because I wasn&#146t selling Nissans&#146 back then.

<b>ENGINE</b>:
2.5, 2.5 S and 2.5 SL all have a 2.5 liter DOHC 16 valve 4 cylinder engine.  The 3.5 SE is 3.5 liter V6 DOHC 24 valve engine.  The engine is constructed with aluminum alloy to reduce weight, improve the fuel economy and gain more power.  Another cool thing with all the models is that it doesn&#146t need a tune up until it hits the 105,000 mark.  The double platinum spark plugs allow for a maintenance free engine virtually until then.  There is also a timing chain rather than a belt that is guaranteed for the life of the engine.  If for some reason you found that the engine was having a problem, it will drop down into an ECCS (electronic concentrated control system) mode meaning that it will allow you enough time to get the car off the road.  For the ones out there like myself that don&#146t know much about finding things under the hood, the importance stuff is color coded and marked.  You won&#146t be pouring your power steering fluid into the water tank.  The Altima is a front wheel drive vehicle with the option to get Traction Control on the 3.5 SE model only.

<b>SUSPENSION</b>:
The front suspension has a strut design that uses fewer parts and reduces the weight improving the performance of the car.  The front wheels act separately and will react on their own while in the rear suspension the wheels and chassis are helping smooth out the ride.  The only sport tuned suspension out there is on the 3.5 SE.  

<b>BRAKES</b>:
The 4 wheel disc brakes are standard on all models.  The ABS is optional on 2.5 S and up. Enough said on that.

<b>TIRES</b>:
Tires are 16 x 6.5 on the 2.5 and 2.5 S.  17 x7.0 come standard on the 2.5 SL and 3.5 SE, you have the option on the 2.5 S.  All of them come with all season radial tires so you can go from warm Phoenix to snow up in Flagstaff.  

<b>EXTERIOR</b>:
A cool little thing to know about is Nissans&#146 Intelligent Body Assembly System.  Basically what this means is that you can go up to any Nissan, not just the Altima, and measure the space say between the door and the panel.  Take that same measurement and put it to any other space / seal on the car and it will match up perfectly.  Nissan&#146s got all these robots and machines putting the cars together so that they are all done the same way and correctly each time out.  The Altima has a sleek, aerodynamic body that allows less resistance on the road making for a better fuel economy.  Oh, I got another little story here.  The headlights and tail lights were actually designed by the same people from Harley Davidson.  Do you see the resemblance now?  Well the headlights are also polycarbonate crack resistant!  Go ahead punch it as hard as you can, it won&#146t break.  The only model that you can get a rear spoiler on is the 3.5 SE.

<b>INTERIOR</b>:
It is standard on all models that they come with those luxurious bucket seats.  I love buckets seats.  I was sitting in my mom&#146s Honda CRV the other day and just being in there for more than five minutes was unbearable.  Bucket seats are comfy.  There is power and manual 4 to 8 way on the seating plan as well.  What ever makes you comfy.  The seat belts in the front will adjust in case you are a shorty like me and don&#146t want then seat belt crossing the wrong way or area.  The back seats are 60/40 split so you can extend the trunk if needed.  A buddy of mine likes to jump into the trunk to show people how large it is and he is about 6ï¿½&#148 so the point is made.  Also he is able to get out with that handy glow in the dark switch in case of emergency.  I never locked myself in the trunk but I know I did it to my brother years ago.  Well now he would have a way out.  You can get a leather wrapped steering wheel if you want on 2.5 S and it is standard on up.  Oh and for other shorties like me out there the steering doesn&#146t just tilt it also telescopes.  Woo hoo!!!

<b>COMFORT</b>:
This car is made for comfort.  The control and switches, the whole dash, is designed for the driver&#146s ease and safety.  The center console has the 2 position padded arm rest with storage for cds and an outlet for a cell phone to hide in plus those cup holders that I know you all must have to have.  PLUS for all you clean freaks out there, the cup holders have a rubber coating that is washable in the dishwasher.  Another little cool thing is the VALET key.  If you go to Vegas let&#146s say and drive there in your new Altima since the drive would be so comfortable in your luscious bucket seats, you may valet your whole time there.  Well Nissan has a special key and it will not allow the trunk to open or the glove compartment, which is standard on all but the base 2.5 model.  You have your power windows, your keyless entry, your power door locks, cruise control, and all that usual stuff.  There is the handy sun visor extension that comes into play when you just can&#146t get that one little spot that keeps hitting your eyes, EXTEND and it will go away!  For your ladies out there, the mirrors also illuminate at night so you can still fix your lip stick.  The cargo nets come in handy for groceries, standard on 2.5 SL and up and optional on 2.5 S.  The fuel tank has a 20 gallon maximum.

<b>SAFETY</b>:
There are these side steel pipe beams that go diagonal  on inside of the door.  Most companies do them vertical. Well Nissan wants to make sure your injuries are also prevented from your shoulder to your feet not just your ribs.  There are dual airbags on all models and you can add chest protection airbags and roof mounted air bags for rear seaters.  For families there is the LATCH system with tether anchors and the safety rear door locks.  If you were to be hit from behind and pushed forward into another vehicle, have no fear (unless you don&#146t have car insurance) because the Altima has crumple zones left and right and all over the place.  The car will accordion right up for you and if necessary instead of the engine landing in your lap it will automatically fall to the ground and slip under the vehicle.

<b>RADIO/AUDIO</b>:
The AM/FM/CD, 6 speaker, 100 watt amp, speed sensitive volume, and steering wheel mounted controls are all available on the 2.5 S and 3.5 SE.  Standard on the 3.5 SE but you have to fork out additional for the speed volume and controls on the wheel for the 2.5 S.  The Bose audio system comes standard on the 2.5 SL and optional on 2.5 S and 3.5 SE.  This has the 150 watt, 8 speakers, in dash 6 disc CD player with digital clock.  

There are lots of different choices as far as packages:
The Convenience Package
The Convenience Plus Package
Premium Convenience Package
Sport Package
Sport Plus Package
Leather Package
Leather Sport Package
They can get very confusing and there isn&#146t enough room for me to list all the details here.  Make sure you ask to see exactly what is on what package and how much more you are paying for that package.

<b>WRAP UP/DRIVING EXPERIENCE</b>:
The Altima has a unique look for the individualist in you. The ride is smooth and the liquid filled engine mounts absorb most of the engine vibrations making for a quiet ride.  On the passenger's side the front and rear suspension help keeping out the vibrations as well.  I think no matter what model you choose, the pep to all models is very good.  In fact when I first started driving them to get a feel (you have to test drive all vehicles extensively before you sell them and you have to get certified in product knowledge in order to sell them), I was shocked as how much pick up/pep that the engine gives you.  Some other cars in this same class are much more sluggish I guess you could say compared to the Altima.  It is the way that the engine was put together whether 2.5 liter or 3.5 liter that allows the acceleration to be quick and smooth as well.  Even if you decide to do the manual shift, the acceleration will shift up smoothly and you don't have to quickly go from 1st to 2nd just to get the pep going.  The Altima handles well whether it is from the rack and pinion steering or the all season radial tires or the way it was built with all those robots I spoke about earlier.  Regardless of the reasons why, The Altima is very responsive to every way the steering wheel will turn, sensitive I think is the word I was looking for.  You could be flying down the highway or slowly moving through traffic and that response of the way you steer the car will remain the same.  If you were to take it through a sharp curve whether fast or slow, the outside of the car will not lean like other models in its class.  The Altima stays balanced.  The handling of the car is great and if you need to make that sudden movement to avoid an accident, the car will respond as quickly as you do just to get you out of harms way.  The only model that can come with the Traction Control System is the 3.5 SE which is designed to help the tires grip the pavement, but if it isn't an option on all the models, you can also see it also isn't forking out the extra buck for either.  The tires themselves that come on the vehicle itself will not squeal if you were sitting up at a light and realized you were holding up everyone at the green and had to take off quick.  You just glide out of there and let the embarrassment diminish.  Lastly, the Altima's brakes are not too overly sensitive when you touch the pedal.  The braking is solid and I recommend going with ABS as well.  If you stop suddenly you won't be thrown forward like I have been in my last Chevy Cavalier.  
The dash is set for the driver, not the passenger to touch and mess with the controls.  You could even mount the favorite radio stations onto the controls on the steering wheel should you choose to pick up that option.  If not, you don't have to worry about looking down to long just to turn up your a/c.  The average gas mileage is 23/29.  The trunk is spacious and can fit a nice shopping experience at the Price club for you.  In 2002 it was rated best new car in its class. Need I say more?

One last thing, be careful out there on the pricing.  Shop on a weekday, never a weekend.  Middle of the week usually the best.  Go in the evening but not too late.  Negotiate and don&#146t believe them all the time when they say they are firm.  There is always room  and even if they go below invoice (there is still a hidden $1-2K that most consumers don't know about that they will still get from Nissan, so going a few hundred dollars is not hurting them), believe me they are making it up in financing someway somehow.  So be careful out there and Enjoy The Ride!!!

Until the next Nissan Review,
