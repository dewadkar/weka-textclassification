            Oh Gosh, Not a MiniVan Please....

There comes a point in our 30's that many of us consider the word.... MiniVan....  Do we really need it, do we really want one, can we handle moving on to this stage of our lives?  Buying a minivan to me felt like giving up on my &quot;good years&quot;.  This is the logo for the soccer mom, was I ready for it?

In a word, NO, but I have had the pleasure of driving this van extensively because a family member happens to have one.  If I was going to own a minivan this would be the first one I would consider buying.

Here's what I love about the Astro Van by Chevy:
    
1) The interior looks like a mini-motor home.   The dash area is large and both driver and passenger have large captain's type chairs.   The 2 rear chairs are just as nice and comfortable, even on a long trip.  Behind the 4 chairs is a bench seat, which is capable of folding down into a bed.  All the side windows have cloth mini blinds for easy on your long road trips or even for everyday kid hauling use if  you live in a sunny  location like Houston, Texas.  There are lots of extra's like drink holders, places for magazines and storage compartments.

2)  My brother in law's version also came with a TV and VCR console that comes in oh so handy on long trips.  We take a yearly trek to Illinois for a family reunion.  The TV/VCR saved us last year, we took all 6 kids and put them in the minivan, each with a favorite movie, and they stayed very entertained the whole way.  Of course we fought over who's movie would be watched when, but at least it shut them up while they were watching!  For security reasons, it is especially nice that the unit is totally removable, so you won't find your van broken into because thieves saw the unit in your driveway.  

3)  The van handles very well.  It really has a lot of power.  Chevy put a 6 cylinder, 4.3 Liter, 190 Horsepower engine in this motel room on wheels.  The steering is tight and the van handles very well.    It also has a towing capacity of 5500 pounds, which comes in handy!

4)  The van is all wheel drive, has running boards to make entrance and exit easier, and is pretty much a great van to drive.

Here's what I don't particularly care for on this van:
1)   The gas mileage is pretty bad, 15-19 mpg.  So with fuel prices the way they are you don't get much for your money!

2)  You have to do a little more service on this van than other newer vehicles I've owned.  They have had the van in the shop over 4 times for various reasons during the last 9 months.  AC went out, locks stopped working, small stuff like that, but on a vehicle this new, you don't want to be fixing things right off that bat, even if they are covered under warranty.

Overall, I'd say this is a great family vehicle for every one, if you have 1 child or the whole team, it's comfy, seats a lot of people, and has all the extra's you could want.  All that's missing is the microwave to pop the popcorn during the movies!
