            This review is not about the 2000 model. It is about how you can get into a Lexus at an affordable price. 

A few years ago, I wanted a luxury car. I wanted a Lexus. At first, I didn't even plan to go to the Lexus dealership. $40,000+ was more than I could afford for a car. A friend convinced me to check it out anyway. I'm glad I did.

I found out about the Lexus Certified Pre-Owned program. I was able to buy a three year old Lexus, with a warranty, for around $20-25,000. Big difference. I owned that car for two years and I loved it. Smooth ride, standard leather, CD player, sun roof, the works. The air is temperature controlled so you are always comfortable. 

My only caution on the ES300 models in general is that they seem to &quot;fit&quot; women better. My husband hated driving mine. My mother and another friend  both have ES300's and their husbands also find them uncomfortable to drive.  So, if you ladies want a nice car that your husband won't ever beg to drive, this one will be all yours. :)
