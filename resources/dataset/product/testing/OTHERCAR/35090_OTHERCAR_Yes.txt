            I have the Accord LX Wagon, which I purchased approximately one year ago. I have to state from the start that I am amazed by the quality of this automobile.  Granted, mine appears to have been properly maintained for its life thus far.  At the time of purchase it had about 158,000 mile on the odometer.  Currently, it has 176,000 miles.  I paid $4900 for this car, and I believe its one of my best purchases ever.

One surprising aspect to me is that the engine does not leak or burn any oil!  In fact, I might only have to add oil once between oil changes.  And, I don't change the oil every 3000 miles, or that sort of thing.  The oil and filter are changed based upon the built-in maintenance meter on the vehicle's dashboard.  This engine is all original, has never been rebuilt, and is a true testament to the quality of Honda engines.

I recently noticed on the NHTSA (National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration) web site that this vehicle fared very well for both driver and passenger in their crash tests.  This is important for me to know in the interest of mine and my family's safety.

As far as maintenance issues are concerned, I recently had new tires placed on the car.  I also had to have a right front CV boot installed.  I believe that the transmission was replaced once on the car before I purchased it, but that has been the only major mechanical work performed.  The car has the original paint, and it is in very good condition, except for some minor rust which is appearing around the left rear fender area.  I have noticed this on several Accords of this vintage, and it appears to be a common problem, and should be noted.  The interior condition is beautiful, and everything works.

This vehicle has cruise control, stereo/cassette, A/C, power windows, power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, rear window defroster and wiper and cloth seats.  The cloth seats, by the way, have held up very well over the years and are in great condition, and they are very supportive and comfortable.  It also has a power moonroof, which is a very nice feature.  The brakes are excellent.

This vehicle handles very well.  It can zip around the corners effortlessly, and if someone is tailgating you its not hard at all to get away once you encounter a curvy road!  The brakes are excellent.  This car is also fairly quiet while cruising.  The engine, a 16 valve four, is fairly powerful, and moves the car briskly along.  In addition, the fuel mileage is very good.  I have seen 30 mpg on trips, averaging 60+ mph.  The worst mileage I have seen is 20 to 21, city driving.

Incidentally, I am not writing this positive review only because I am a Honda addict or anything.  I have owned several makes and models of cars.  I have owned Fords, a Saab, an MG, a Jeep, a Toyota, a Mazda, a Chevrolet, and a BMW.

In summary, if you can find a well maintained 1991 Honda Accord wagon you can't go wrong.  The quality is superb.
