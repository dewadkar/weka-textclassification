            Great camera that is easy to use.  Very high quality images, Anyone who wants to take part in digital photography as a beginner or a pro would like the quality of this camera and its ease of use.  The camera is light weight and uses smart media rather than using a 3.5 inch floppy, so you are not carrying a 3.5 inch floppy drive every where you go.  The price of this camera is much lower than the price of the cameras using 3.5 inch floppy drives, with the difference in price you can buy 64 meg of storage which is more than anyone will normally use.  One problem is that it is hard to find a spare battery and charger.  This camera seems to be new on the market and many stores do not have spare rechargeable batteries or chargers, but the camera doesn't uses the battery power very fast and recharges quickly, so I wouldn't let that stop anyone from buying this camera.
