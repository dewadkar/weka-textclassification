            I bought this car three months ago and I really like it.  It handles well, I like that it has traction control.  It can really pick up speed, which can be the down side....  No speeding tickets yet, but I have to be really careful.  It is a lot of fun to drive.

The front seats are very comfortable, the back leaves something to be desired. I bought this car to replace a Mazda 626.  The Mazda had a better back seat, but the Pontiac has better front seats.  I have the 6 cylinder engine, which I am told is very good.  It uses more gas than my old car (about 22 miles to the gallon in city driving), and I don't like that as well!  But it is a fun car to drive.  The transmission is excellent, this is my first automatic car, and I am much happier with it that I would expect.  

I feel very safe in this car.  One thing that I don't like is that I find it hard to see out the rear window, which is smaller than on my old car.  The mirrors are good, but the passenger one is one of those which makes objects look farther away, I am not used to that type of mirror.

I compared this car with Fords, the Volkswagon Jetta, and the Honda Accord, and found this to be a lot of car for the money.  I like that it does not require a lot of service and maintenance- I have always had Japanese cars and it was very expensive to maintain them.  This car doesn't need major maintenance until 100,000 miles.  I also purchased the extended warranty, to give me more peace of mind.<br><br>
