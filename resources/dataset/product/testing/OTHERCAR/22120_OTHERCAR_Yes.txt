            I got this camera in December of 1999 and it's still going strong. I absolutely love it! Working at a store that sells digital cameras, even though I drool over the newer, shinier, higher pixel models all the time, this camera still satisfies me!

This camera takes 1.3 megapixel pictures. While "experts" are now saying that anything below 2.0 megapixil is highly unsatisfactory, I say they are wrong. The pictures that come out of this camera are absolutly excellent, and come on, how often do you REALLY think that you're going to be making 11x14 copies of ANY picture? Don't be fooled into that hype.

The 2x zoom is nice also. Sure, it's not as fancy as the 3x and 6x that is out now, but unless you're looking to take way far off shots (such as deer across a field), the 2x zoom works GREAT for the average person's use.

In the deal that I got with my camera, it came with a 4 MB memory card and a 16 MB memory card. The 16 MB memory card holds around 60 pictures on it. I can take my camera on a 3 day vacation and not have to worry about running out of space ("film") or the batteries dying. Keeping the LCD screen off and aiming the camera like you would a 35 mm camera saves on batteries incredibly. It also helps that I have a compact flash card reader, so when I get home, I don't have to waste time and batteries plugging the camera into the computer, but just pop the card out, stick it in the card reader, and away we go!

The one down-fall I had with this camera is that I accidently managed to break the itty-bitty tiny clasp that holds the batter tray in the camera. This happened shortly after the cameras 1 year warranty expired, so I was out of luck with that. It would have been $35 just to get a QUOTE from Kodak about the cost of fixing it, so some tape will do me fine.

Other than that, it seems like a pretty durable camera. I spent a year and a half photographing animals at the local animal shelter (for their website) and between all the playful kitties and jumping puppies and dogs, the camera survived it. One annoyance is the time between pictures, especially if you're photographing anything that can randomly move (such as small kids or pets). You take on picture and you're waiting 2-5 seconds before you can take the next. It doesn't sound like a lot of time, but that perfect shot where your subject was looking cute AND right at the camera can be ruined with just a turn of the head!


This camera is incredibly easy to use and comes with great software. My camera illiterate friends have great fun with it and my computer illiterate father is still able to print all his pictures off of the computer all by himself. It's an all around easy to use great model.
