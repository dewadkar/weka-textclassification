            I bought this car for the style, its beautiful. Its safe and comfortable. The handling is average. I wish I had opted for the &quot;s&quot; model. The power is OK but not up to par with the segment. I was quite disappointed in the estimate for repairing for my heated seats. The only way to repair them is to replace them. The coils (heating elements) are not replaceable. The two seats that need replacing were tremendously expensive. Add that to the key replacement that cost more than my weekly grocery bill and its disappointing for the top of the line product. <br><br>
