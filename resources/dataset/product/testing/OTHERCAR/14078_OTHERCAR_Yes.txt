            Used high-end BMWs are a fantastic bargain. There are lots of very clean, low mileage examples around and being sold for the price of a Volkswagon! Why so cheap? The people who buy 740s don't buy used cars - there is no market for them. But for those in the know - you can own the best for less than a third of what the first owner paid! I bought mine with only 14,000 miles for $US19,700!

Forget about numbers - they reveal nothing about this car. You can study such things as curb weight, overall length, power, gear ratios, and countless other specifications - but you would be no closer to understanding the BMW 740i. Many automobiles may claim superiority by-the-numbers to the 740 in selected specifications but few, if any, will measure up to the total package. And it is the whole that counts.

The essence of this car is the driving experience. It is like a wonderful drug that at once heightens perception and imparts an overall feeling that all is right with the world and life is great. It feels like being in command of the Enterprise - massive, but without mass - travelling at the speed of light while appearing stationary. Everything about this car is contradictory.

The 740i is a master of many environments. Although supremely comfortable, the driver is not isolated from the outside world with vague steering, total silence, and over suppressed suspension.  Precise steering and perfectly blended suspension gives the car handling that puts it much closer to the sports car section than the luxury sedan class.  The engine produces silky, linear power and sings an inspired song - just this side of Ferrari. The five-speed automatic is truly worthy of an enthusiast's car. The brakes are the stuff of dreams.

Cockpit layout is just the way I like it. With 14 power adjustments for the driver's seat and 4 for the steering wheel, this car will fit anyone like it was custom built for you. The classic white on black analog instrumentation, supplemented with a discrete on-demand digital information display provides everything required without any clutter.

The climate control works invisibly - just dial in your desired temperature and forget about it - summer or winter it'll take care of you.  The stereo system has a sophisticated sound and is reasonably intuitive to use. Overall power and bass response might not be adequate for the rapper set.

The structure of the car feels impenetrable. The doors are thick and heavy - things on the outside are going to stay there. The interior is nearly completely wrapped in the highest quality pebble-grain leather and the dash, and doors are trimmed in exotic wood accents. As with the metallic paint, the wood looks best in the bright light of direct sun.


Being a passenger is no hardship. The front passenger enjoys the same seat adjustments bestowed upon the driver and has his/her own climate controls.  Everyone gets individually controlled heated seats  - even the rear. The rear seat passengers also have limited climate control over their space.



 Despite its ample presence, the interior space is not excessive. Four full-size adults can ride in style, but a fifth would be cramped. The trunk volume is plentiful, but the shallow depth is limiting. The rear seat does not fold down to allow the flexibility of carrying occasional larger objects. Since this is a feature found on even the most rudimentary of vehicles, I guess BMW concluded that it was too plebian for such a high-end car. I disagree - it would be a welcome addition to the vehicle.

Auto up and down on all the windows and the sunroof is an appreciated feature. The doorlocks work well, but the electro-mechanical actuators are not as quiet and sophisticated as Audi's vacuum system. The interior lighting ambiance was well thought out - the combination indirect floor lighting and recessed roof lighting produce an unobtrusive, homogeneous interior illumination for entry and egress.

There are quality touches -too numerous to list - everywhere on the vehicle. But in keeping with the contradictory nature of the vehicle, completely incongruous parts and features occasionally will also confront you. For example; the accelerator pedal hinge is formed by a thinned section of plastic - the absolute cheapest means. Further, the interface between the pedal and the linkage is plastic on plastic - no bearings or precision sockets as you would expect. I'm sure you would not find anything like this on a Honda.

And take a look in the prominently featured tool kit affixed to the inside of the truck lid. Despite the large dimensions of the plastic tray, there are only a few common tools. And the tools that are enclosed are of the lowest quality - the kind that you would find in the "199 pieces for $1.99" sets advertised in the back sections of pulp magazines. For a car of this stature, I want to see Snap-On!

I guess itï¿½s a tribute to the BMW 740i that the criticisms are of such a petty nature. Its not about the tool kit - its about driving.
