            We recently purchased a 2000 Chrysler Concorde. We were lucky enough to get in on the great financing deal that they were offering: .9% for 3 years. How could I refuse a deal like that!

Anyway, we are very pleased with the vehicle. It is very roomy and comfortable. Roomy was very important, because we transport our grandkids (quantity 3), and 2 of them are in child seats. So with 3 kids in the back, room was very important. There is plenty of room in the front for my wife and I. We found the seats very comfortable, and very adjustable , so anyone should be able to make the seats fit their needs.

We purchased the LXi version, which pretty much came with everything. The only option we added was the sunroof. This was a change for us, as we never had a sunroof before. It is really nice to have the added ventilation, and it sure makes the car brighter inside.

We do not have the upgraded sound package (which included the 4 CD changer). We figured we can only listen to one CD at a time &lt;G&gt;, so we could stick to the single player. The sound is very good, and the radio reception is better than on other cars we have owned.

We chose the Cinnamon color, which, again, was a departure for us. We usually choose a lighter color, but wanted something different. When clean and polished, this car really gleams in the sunlight. I highly recommend checking into this color if you are in the market.

The ride is extremely quiet. I have to check the tachometer to determine whether the engine is running, because it is so smooth and quiet.

Mileage has been pretty good, though I realize it really isn't broken in yet, and that it will go up. I am getting about 17 mpg around town and 23 mpg on the highway. We will see how much better it gets.

I highly recommend this vehicle. Comfort, value, styling all come together to make this an excellent vehicle. You won't be sorry if you choose one.<br><br>
