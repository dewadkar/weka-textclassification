            I bought this camera for my boyfriend and reluctantly used it during our vacation to Europe. I was not disappointed. It took great, crisp pics and I was happily able to delete the pics I didn't want. 

The last time I went to Europe, I was a college kid, and was going for 6 weeks. I figured I'd need 50 rolls of film, which I bought. I took pictures of everything  and used up about 48 rolls. Spent hundreds of dollars on the film and developing, then on copies to give to friends/family who wanted something. What a commitment! 

With the digital camera, you can email pics, print them up, send them out, make post cards, greeting cards, etc, without having to pay another dime to do so. So, you use up more ink in your printer. This is the true reason for color printers! To enhance our lives. I've sent packets of wallet sized pics to friends and family so they can see what I did and where I was. 

The end of post cards. This trip marked the end of the post card for me. I spent about $1.25 for each card and stamp. I could have spent less than that by sending several small pics in a letter!

Anyway - I love the ability to zoom in and out, to take movies (soundless, 15 or 33 seconds at a time), to delete pics that you've changed your mind about or in which your friend's eyes are closed. Just take another two, three or four, and pick the one you like, delete the rest.

I don't like the fact that when you look through the view finder, you won't see the entire picture of what you're taking. Your view is cut off a bit, so you're actually including in your picture a little bit more than you're looking at. 

The batteries died maybe 1 week after my trip started. Thank goodness for the guy at J&R who told me to get batteries. I brought rechargeable batteries and they worked well.

I used a SanDisk SmartMedia card and another one, can't remember the name. The second one gives me a "Card Error" when I was ready to upload the pics onto my desktop. Not something I want to see after taking pictures of beautiful Italy. After a few prayers and attempts, it worked. Haven't touched it since. 

All in all, this was a great buy and a good investment. My friend's digital camera had a smaller screen, and it wasn't as clear. Couldn't see certain details and it was slower.
