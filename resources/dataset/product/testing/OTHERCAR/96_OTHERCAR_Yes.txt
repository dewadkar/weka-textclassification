            I bought our baby over a year ago off a used lot with approximately 25K on the clock.We have put nearly 4k on it this summer with no problems at all.It is absolutely a fun vehicle.While I would not recommend the car for long trips or high speed freeway driving with the top down,it is a winner on the back roads. The handling is tight and cornering is excellent.The soft top is relatively easy to raise and lower with the only problem being the plastic rear window is easily damaged.This has been corrected in the later models with a glass window.The 1.8 liter four cylinder has more than enough pep to pull you through the curves with the 5 speed gearbox.An automatic is available but rare and where's the fun in that.The only other quibble I have is the flip up headlights.While they are neat you do have the sensation of driving in a tunnel after night.There is an after market kit available to correct this.For the cost it is really hard to beat this vehicle.<br><br>
