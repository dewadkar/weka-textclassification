            Blaring horns. Staring people. Shouts of �Get that piece of #!$@ off the road!�

These are the sort of reactions that my 2002 Pontiac Aztek has inspired since I bought it a week ago.

But I don�t care�I love my Aztek! Yes, it took me a while to get past that ugly, squared-off rear end, but I, like so many other proud owners, have discovered its inner beauty. It wasn't even a vehicle that I was originally considering. It still amazes me that the car I heckled the first time I saw it on "Survivor" is now the one I own.

THE SEARCH FOR A ROOMY VEHICLE BEGINS
Originally, I wanted something that would hold more cargo than my 1997 four-door Plymouth Neon. I was tired of bothering my nephew, who drives a Durango, anytime I wanted to move something large, and I was sick of having to use an exterior bike rack to drive to the trails.

The first vehicle I looked at was the PT Cruiser, which I think is just as ugly as the Aztek. But I must admit that I was impressed when I saw that the seats are removable. Because we have had good luck with Chryslers in the past, it made my �short list.�

Since we were in no hurry because we weren�t in desperate need of a vehicle, hubby and I expanded our horizons and looked at a wide variety of small SUVs. We poked, prodded, and test drove everything from the Sportage to the CRV to Forrester to the Vibe.

At the Pontiac dealership, when I described all the attributes I was looking for to the salesman, he said, �You know, I think you should really try the Aztek.�

After I as done laughing uproariously and making disparaging comments about the �Survivor Car,� he said, �No, REALLY! A test drive is free. What will it hurt?�
That�s true, so I broke down and hopped into a nice little 2002 2WD Aztek with the Comfort and Security package. As we barreled down the road, I couldn�t help but thinking, �Hey, this is really nice!�

THE AZTEK WINS ME OVER
The ugly duckling vehicle moved even higher in my estimation when he showed me all the neat little bells and whistles, like a driver information center that will tell me what direction I�m going, how many miles I can travel before I run out of gas, the outside temperature, and even when it wants an oil change.

There were various other neat features such as separate temperature controls for driver and front passenger (a marriage saver�why do I always want it hot when he wants it cold and visa versa?), the famous pull-out cooler, removable storage bags in the doors, radio controls right on the steering wheel, and even an automatic system so that I�ll never have to remember to turn my headlights on or off. This car is so smart that it will chime if I forget to turn off the turn signal, and if I leave my keys in the ignition and lock the doors, it will automatically unlock the driver�s door (at least it stops short of calling me a moron).

I also liked the fact that it has standard side airbags. As a long-time driver of a small car in a world of SUVs, I had begun to fear for my life. Even though the Aztek is more in the SUV league, I feel better with an extra measure of protection.

ROOM TO SPARE
And all that is at the front end. The back really wowed me with its roominess and huge cargo capacity. The back seats fold down, and they can also be removed completely. Then, you can fold down the front passenger seat and haul something really long, like a kayak (my dream for this summer).

I also loved the sliding cargo tray, which is part of the comfort and security package. Instead of having to lean over and reach way in to put put in or take out items, you simply slide the tray right to you. It also has several handy built-in compartments. Removing it is a breeze, and it even has wheels so you don�t have to carry it when you take it out.

The tailgate is made for parties, complete with butt-shaped indentations for ease of sitting and molded cup holders.

IT'S NOT THAT I HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST THEM, BUT WOULD I REALLY WANT MY DAUGHTER TO MARRY ONE?
Okay, so I was overcoming my initial skepticism, and the idea of owning an Aztek was growing on me. But could I really do it? Would I take the plunge? I knew that if I did, I would be the subject of ridicule at work, where everyone was buying Escapes, Forresters, and CRVs, and I could just see me explaining myself to all my so-called friends before they signed the commitment paper.

But heck, I'm a rebel. Why not take the plunge? I've been anti-SUV for a long time, so now that I was finally giving in for reasons of cargo capacity (not to mention safety...in a car, I barely feel like I have a fighting change on the road with all those tanks surrounding me).

There was only one ground rule: No yellow or fire engine red. The dealership closest to my home, where I took the test drive, had four equipped with Comfort/Security, and two were acceptable colors (blue and champagne, both of which I really liked).

DISCOUNTS ARE GOOD
I had discovered that the company I work for is a GM supplier, which makes me eligible for a discount (4 percent over what GM employees pay, or about $100 under invoice). I mentioned that I wanted a 7 year extended warranty, too, as I doubt that Azteks will have much resale value so I figured I would have to keep it for the long haul. The dealer quoted me full price on the warranty and didn�t make any mention of any willingness to deal, so I didn�t make my purchase that day.

DO YOUR RESEARCH!
I used to the internet to locate other suitable vehicles at other nearby dealers (it should go without saying that at the beginning of my car search, I printed out at least two copies of the invoice prices of every vehicle I looked at from sources like stoneage.com, carpoint.com, kbb.com, edmunds.com, etc. and made sure I was aware of the holdbacks, any rebates and dealer cash, etc.).

Another dealership, a bit father away but still within reason, had a maroon Aztek, a color on which I was neutral. It had the package I wanted, but also a sunroof, which means that it didn�t have the usual Onstar. That�s okay with me, as I wouldn�t pay $16.95 for a glorified cell phone after the first free year anyway.

This dealership was willing to make me a deal on the warranty, and they let me take the vehicle home for the night so I could drive it under the conditions I would be using it in real life. The next morning, I was ready to seal the deal.

AND THEY LIVED (MOSTLY) HAPPILY EVER AFTER
I�ve had �Cayonero� (my affectionate name for it, stolen from the Simpsons) for a week now, and I love it more than ever. I still haven�t figured out all of the bells and whistles or how to customize its many features, but we have the next 7 years to get to know each other. I�ve already used it to haul furniture and groceries, both of which it handled easily. It�s so roomy that I�ve surprised I don�t hear an echo.

While the ride is smooth, I find the brakes to be just a bit mushy. Also, the split rear window takes some getting used to. After being heckled by strangers, I joined an online Aztek �support group,� and one of their suggestions was getting a clip-on rear view mirror to expand your view. I haven�t tried that yet, but I think it will be a big improvement.

The rear top gate is also hard to close. Half the time I think it as latched, then find out that it hasn�t when I get in the car and see the idiot light.

But those faults are small, and I should be used to them, as my Neon�s brakes and visibility were the pits. At least my Aztek has the size, space, and power to make up for it.
Am I happy with my choice? Absolutely!! But I�m also stymied by the weirdoes who shout obscenities at a total stranger. Is the vehicle I drive really all that important to them?

GM would have had a real winner if they had put a decent-looking body on this wonderful little vehicle. Sadly, they made it an ugly ducking with a gorgeous swan hidden inside. I�m just glad that I�m in on the secret. Even if you totally can�t stand its looks, be open minded enough to take it for a test drive. When I saw it on Survivor, I swore I would never own one�now I�m eating my words and happy to do it!
