              After perusing the epinion articles on Suburbans, I just had to get my two cents worth of an epinion in on them too!  I am a 37 y.o. mother of four  and my hubby moved us up from a Ford Explorer to a 'Burb this past summer.Hence, I feel we have driven it long  enough to voice an epinion on it.
  First, I'd like to say that all the articles are pro-Suburban (unless this has changed since I read thru them).  I have to agree with all the pro-comments (i.e. mechanically sound, large gas tank that is convenient when traveling, extremely roomy and rides smoother than most cars!) however, I'd like to be the first naysayer about this vehicle.  Now, yes, I do re-commend the vehicle highly for all the pro reasons above.  But, being the practical, common-sense type, I base my selections on my lifestyle needs.  And based on this, most would say a 'Burb should meet the needs of a family our size (which is what we thought when we purchased it).Well, I say I'd rather have a Town &amp; Country Minivan!
  I could go into a long, drawn out, point by point explanation/comparison to the minivan, but I will spare you and get right to the major points/
differences.  My children's ages range from two months to eleven years old.  I spend a minimum of 3-5 minutes holding the darn second seat up so
the older ones (and maybe a friend or two) can pass thru into the back third seat.  Then, using it as a family vehicle in our small rural town,
I find it difficult to maneuver on some side streets and parking lots related to the size.  I had test driven a Town &amp; Country prior to getting
the 'Burb and not only did it seem to fit all the pro characteristics the
'Burb possesses BUT it is also easier for children to get in and out of
independently (as far as the third seat is concerned) AND is easier to 
maneuver in tight areas AND MOST importantly, is a heck of a lot less
money!
  So, yes, I recommend the 'Burb to those it might meet their lifestyle needs and those who don't mind the inconveniences I listed above.  It is
also great for those who need the extra room for transporting large objects like furniture maybe.  It is also better for people who will be using it on the open road, highways versus in town because of its' size.  It's wonderful for sports buffs to use to haul equipment and trailers.I am sure farmers love it!  Some people like it just because it seems to
have become trendy and status quo for those who like to &quot;be in the vogue&quot;.  For me, personally though, I say to those people &quot;Enjoy your 'Burb!  Just let me have my Town &amp; Country though!&quot;
