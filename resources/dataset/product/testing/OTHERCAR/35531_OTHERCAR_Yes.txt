            The Kodak 3900 is the first digital camera I have owned.  Over all, it is a good camera.  I received this as a gift, so I had no input into the purchase of the camera.  However, for my use - quick and simple shots - it serves well.  It is small, easy to use, and takes good pictures.  However, the battery life is poor, and it does not have a manual focus.

Picture Quality
I cannot get over the clarity of the picture quality.  I have stumped many when I show off my prints from this camera.  They cannot believe it comes from a digital camera.  I have experimented with the various settings as to pixels, but have a habit of going all out with the 3.1 Mega Pixel.

Lense
I am slightly disappointed with the fact that the lense does not provide a manual focus option.  The camera does a great job of auto focusing, but those pictures of lights and a like at night do not turn out too well.

Unit
This is a great unit to carry with you.  It is small, light weight.  I usually just turn it on and start taking pictures.  It is sturdy - I have dropped once or twice with no damage.  Overall, it is a great unit to have with you for those quick shots you want to take.

Software
Initially, I used the Picture Perfect software that shipped with the unit, however, I have gone away with it now.  The software has some nice features, however, to load and to read pictures off of the camera.  I have now switched to Windows XP to transfer pictures from my camera to my PC, and Adobe Photoshop for photo editing.  This camera works great with XP.  I can plug it in via USB, XP will ask me if I want to copy the pictures to my computer, where I want to save them, the naming format for the files, and whether to delete them from the camera when done.  I once moved 75 pictures from the 3900 to my PC through Windows XP and deleted them off of my camera in about 90 seconds!

Battery
I do not have the Easy Dock unit, so I have the battery issue.  The unit will take 2 AA batteries, however it uses them pretty poorly; more so if you use the LCD screen when taking pictures.  I highly recommend investing in the Easy Dock Station, rechargeable AA batteries, or a lot of spare AA batteries if you do not want to run out.

Memory
I have a 128 MB stick in my 3900 and have yet to fill it.  I have had in access of 90 pictures, at 3.1 Mega Pixels quality, stored in memory, with room for many more.

Overall
I find this camera to be a great little unit.  It is not too sophisticated, has ample features, and works great on auto.  There is room for more features, such as manual focus, and better battery consumption, but all in all it is a great value for the price!
