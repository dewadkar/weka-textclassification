            I have owned a S2000 since January 2000.  I have driven it across country from Boston to Austin, as well as around town and around the Austin hill country.

When driven at normal city speeds, the car is similar to many other cars with adequate power.  Its &quot;cruising&quot; score is high, because of the cars good looks and rarity.  At lease at the present time, I think its &quot;prestige&quot; factor is near the Porsche boxster, although some will not recognize it.  Where I live, the boxster is a very common car, so the S2000's limited availability is a nice luxury.  I think is also superior to the Z3 because there are also common.  (Don't compare this car to the Miata, since the S2000 will blown its brains out.)

Of course, the real difference in this car is the engine.  The 9000 rpm redline is a blast, and I engine the engine's sound as I blast past other cars.  It really has all the power you need, although it would be nicer if it started at a lower rpm with additional torque.  However, this would mean a larger engine, more weight and diminished handling prowess.

The S2000 does not pretend to be an exotic, instead it is a street version of a true sports car, which have traditionally been smaller displacement powerplants.  Honda's other engineering feats in this car and the firm, yet supple, suspension, the rigid frame and taut steering.  This car could make an excellent race car for its own series.

The cost of the car precludes common ownership, which I see as a good thing.  The cost is justified by the performance, fit and finish of the car, which is excellent.

Everyone knows the negatives: poor stereo, limited space and storage.  The storage is sufficient for most uses, and the size is perfect for me at 6 foot tall.  A large or very tall person will not fit in this car.  The stereo is an embarrassment for this price of car and future S2000 may get a better one.  But no one buys a car for the stereo, and Honda was correct in thinking it would have no effect on demand.  

The positives:  handling, acceleration, technical achievement, prestige, fun, fast.  It is amazing that in many ways seems as good as it can be.  You cannot say that about many cars.  And its a Honda - dependability is virtually guaranteed.<br><br>
