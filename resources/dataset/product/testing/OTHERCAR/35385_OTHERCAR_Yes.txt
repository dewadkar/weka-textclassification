            I own a 560 SL Mercedes Benz, 1988.  I have had it for six years.  I bought it because I do not make much money and could not afford to buy a car, new or old,  every year.  When I went into the Collection to buy it, the mulato sales man put a frown on his handsome  face and laughed that superior salesman's  laugh ( It was important to mention his race because I am a black woman and did not want the world or my limited readership, to think that I was being discriminated against  by some race other than my own.)  He said, &quot;You really don't want this car do you?&quot;  I said that I did. He said it belonged to the owner.  I said that was O.K.; he said later he did not think I could afford the car.  I told him that I could not afford to be without it.    I took it for a test drive.  I liked it.  I knew that it would last me a good long time.  It was just  what a divorced mom with three children needed to survive.  Well, to make a long story short, I finally talked them into selling it to me at a reasonable cost, with the boss's recently purchased backseat in the rear. Til this day I believe, they (the salesman and his crowd) believe they took me.  But, no.  That car was a find.   It has not given me a minute's trouble in seven  years.  Just this year I will have to have an oil leak fixed and remove a dent I put into the driver's  door through inattention.

Want a good car?  Buy a used Benz.  They last!  Well worth the investment.  You might not want to visit the Collection though.<br><br>
