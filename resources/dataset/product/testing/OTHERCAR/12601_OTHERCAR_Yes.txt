            The company I work for decided to treat us all to Canon PowerShot S10's for Christmas in 2000 - luckily, I was told in advance to return the Kodak DC240 my fiance had bought me so I could have this one instead.

At first, I was a little hesitant, because not only had I received a great gift from her, I really liked the usability and feel of the DC240.

I converted.  And I don't feel guilty about that.  

(The point of this first part, mainly, is to illustrate that both cameras are really rather nice - and that I didn't pay for mine, hence I can't really list "price paid" in this review.  You'd have to look elsewhere for pricing.)

The first thing I noticed about the camera is the look and feel of it.  It's got a little bit of heft to it for such a small camera, which I like.  The lighter cameras always feel to me like there's not much to them, as if they're shoddily built.

The menu system to the camera (which shows on the LCD display on the back) takes a little getting used to, but after taking a few pictures and deleting them, you start to get a feel for how it operates.  There's a quasi-toggle button (I'm not sure how to describe it) which allows you to call up the menu if pressed in one direction; pressing it the other way "sets" your choice (or confirms it).  This is used mainly for confirming the preferences you set.

The zoom button looks like the D-pad on an old-school Nintendo controller, but smaller.  This is used for the zoom feature when taking pictures, and when you're in "playback mode", it's used for scrolling up and down menus.  

The interface, overall, isn't something you can seamlessly jump into, but it takes time, like all high-end electronic devices.  Be patient.  It'll come to you.

I will say, however, that the other few buttons for lighting have been a little confusing.  I had to consult the manual, but after a couple of practice runs, I figured out how to change the lighting and how to use the auto-timer.  

The camera came with a non-rechargeable battery.  Save yourself the trouble now - <b>buy the rechargeable battery kit</b>.  I found one (the code is DK110 if you look online) at BJ's Wholesale for $79.99.  That's the cheapest I've seen it.  

The main reason you'd want rechargeable batteries is due to the display.  It sucks up energy like nothing else with this camera - and you'll want to use it, because after you take a shot, it's nice to look at the outcome and decide if you want to keep it or not.

The camera comes with an 8MB CompactFlash card.  Were you to take shots with this on the highest resolution available, you'd be allowed 12 pictures.  Reducing it down to 800 x 600 pixels, you can take 34 pictures with the card, which convinced me to never ever buy film again.

Software and cables are supplied to connect your camera to your computer for image download.  I found the software (Canon ZoomBrowser) to be very user-friendly, and quite quick.  However, the image download is powered by the juice in your camera, so again you'll want to heavily consider getting rechargeable batteries.

Overall, I'm thrilled with this camera.  I've taken some great pictures, and I plan on taking a lot more.

As a sidenote, I read other reviews of this camera, and I noticed the one where the gentleman said his broke after two weeks.  I don't know quite what happened, but I'd guess it was either a defect, or it was handled poorly.  I keep mine in a camera bag I purchased <i>all the time when I'm not using it</i>.  It's not the sort of thing I want to leave lying around, especially after having invested an extra $120 in accessories.
