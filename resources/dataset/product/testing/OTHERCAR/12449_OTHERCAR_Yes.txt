            OK, I'm not an expert on the technical things about the camera, so don't expect that. But I'll do my best.

First off, I got this camera about a week ago for my 18th birthday (thanks Dad!). Not knowing that there were a pair of batteries included, my dad bought me some to put in there. By the end of the night, the ones he bought me were almost gone.

BATTERIES
I haven't had any other digital camera, but from what I've heard, all of them use up batteries like crazy. If you keep using this camera with the live view all the time, it WILL frustrate you how fast your batteries are used up. But if you just take the pictures and then either turn it off, or turn it off the live view, the batteries will last a LOT longer.

PICTURE QUALITY
I personally think the quality of the pictures are great. With the "Better" image quality (you can choose between Good-159 pics, Better-17 pics, and Best-7 pics) the pictures come out perfectly clear and not grainy at all. The Good pictures do come out a bit grainy, but then you can also take more than 150 pictures with that setting. I always have it on the Better option and then once I upload the pictures to my computer, and resize them (the size at that quality is 2048 px by 1536 px (6.82 in X 5.12 in), the pictures look perfect to me.

OTHER OPTIONS
There are different options for the flash: Auto Flash, Red Eye, Flash On/Off, and Night. There also a 10 second self timer, and Action option and Normal option. I think the flash is great. I took pictures of my friends in almost complete darkness (in the LCD screen, you couldn't see anything) and the pictures came out fine. 

All in all I think this is a great camera. The menu is easy to use, the design is great, and it's easy to turn on and off. Maybe professionals wouldn't want the camera because it doesn't have tons of features, but for the casual photographer, it's a sure bet.
