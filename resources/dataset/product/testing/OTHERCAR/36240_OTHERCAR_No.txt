            The Chevrolet Corsica was certainly a dreadful car. I remember several years ago when my father was looking for a car to replace my mother's 1987 Dodge Omni, which despite being a rather homely car with a bad reputation, served my parents quite well. My mother asked, &quot;What about a Chevy Corsica?&quot; My Dad replied, &quot;Hell no! The only kind of people who drive those cars are guys with buck teeth, pocket pen packs and their glasses taped together!&quot; He actually considered an Acura Legend, but since he was still putting my sister through college, he settled for a more sensible Mercury Mystique.

Let's be brutally honest, the Corsica is obviously not a car enthusiast's vehicle. Its nerdy styling is very uninspired and its obvious market is those people looking for basic no-frills transportation, fleet, and rental car companies. But even on that level you could do much better with a Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, or even a Plymouth Acclaim.  

What's even worse is the car's indifferent build quality and ultra-cheap materials. A friend of mine actually had one of these cars for a short time for use as a work car. His 1980 Chevrolet Citation had just given up the ghost after 12 years and an amazing 195,000 miles! His other car was a brand-new Corvette. Talk about one extreme to the other! Anyway, you could tell that this car was cheap by just looking at the interior materials. The dashboard was made of flimsy plastic reminiscent of the toys I used to get from gumball machines for 25 cents as a kid. Even the dashboard nameplate's &quot;Corsica&quot; foil lettering was stamped off center. The air conditioning vents were thin and fragile. The seats were thin and the cloth upholstery was already showing wear. The doors were wafer-thin with the crappiest looking hardware. Compared to the Corsica, his Citation was a Lexus!

Outside of it's bland styling, the exterior showed many flaws. First of all it was painted this yucky teal-silver-blue sort of color I've noticed that all manufacturers use on their economy models. It wasn't long before this paint was fading and flaking off all over the car. Unfortunately Chevy's paint problems weren't confined to awful cars like the Corsica. I had a black 1987 Chevrolet Caprice Classic, an excellent car outside of the paint finish. The top surfaces, (hood, roof, deck) cracked with an &quot;alligatoring&quot; effect. A co-worker still has his two-tone maroon 1987 Caprice that also shows this effect.

The Corsica's most glaring flaw was where the C-pillar sail panel connected to the roof panel. The gap was filled in by a piece of flimsy metal that later bent and stuck above the roofline. Just awful.

About the only good things I could say about this car is that it's engine held up well and that it was dirt-cheap to purchase. 

I'm glad Chevrolet finally got it's act together and started building better cars. The new Malibu, Monte Carlo and Impala testify to this.
My girlfriend is seriously considering the new Impala and it's a quantum leap over the Lumina and galaxies away from the Corsica. Let's just hope Chevy has tackled it's paint problems as well.<br><br>
