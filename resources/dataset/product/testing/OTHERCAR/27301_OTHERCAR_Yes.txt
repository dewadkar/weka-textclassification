            I believe &quot;Durango&quot; is a slavic word for &quot;drives like TANK with poor gas mileage.&quot;  My wife and I made the plunge into a three year lease on a 2000 Durango SLT 4X4 2 months ago and our feeling are mixed at this point.  We were in need of a vehicle with more interior space to lug our never ending cache of car seats, strollers, diaper bags, etc.  Safety standards were also a huge concern of ours in our choice of vehicles.  And no... Dodge does not put Firestones on the Durango!

We chose the 4X4 model SLT as it sits just a hair higher than the comparable 2 wheel drive.  Better visibility was a plus for my wife.  OK, no worries there.  We have the newer 4.7 liter V8 which pumps out 235 horsepower... or so it says.  The engine has felt sluggish to me on many occasions.  235 HP and sluggish?  I formerly drove a Honda Civic with maybe 115 HP and it never felt sluggish.  OK, the weight of the Durango beast is a factor but this engine may still have bugs to be worked out.  Of the choices of engines... the 4.7 V8 seemed the most logical... some people that have fantasies about towing houses, boats, or the entire city block may choose the 5.9 liter V8.  The 5.9 will suck the life out of your wallet with its constant need for fuel.  Everyday city driving will net you about 8 mpg with the 5.9.  The 4.7 gives us about 13.5 for city driving and I am actually pleased with that.  I cried for a few weeks but now realize that it is a gift to make it to 13.5 in town with this tank.  There is also a 5.2 liter engine offered in the 2wd mode for those going that route.

No leather in our SLT.  Living in Arizona, having leather in your vehicle just means you have not been in AZ that long and you think you are still in the Jersey suburbs.  Tan cloth interior with the 3rd seat.  And there it is... the 3rd seat... awesome.  Fold flat when not needed, easy operation, and fitting for adults if needed.  Niiiiiiice.  Other SUV's we looked at failed miserably in there attempt to have a practical 3rd seat.  Tahoe=fail, Expedition=fail, Montero=FAIL.  Seriously, the practical use of folding the seat flat quickly changes the interior into the pig of many uses.  

Driving the Durango is the average part of the ownership experience.  A VERY solid ride, you get the feeling you are SAFE in this beast.  Heavy and stable powered by a thirsty V8... what more do we all need?  We have the upgraded tires (31.5) which make the ride a little more rough than a street radial tire would provide.  The larger tires give a more intimidating look to the Durango package and complete the &quot;look&quot;.  

Would I recommend the Durango to others?  Yes, after telling them that it is overpriced due to popularity, that it looks more fun than it drives, and that a lease may be a better option than buying because well... it is a Dodge and may have some reliability issues after 3 or 4 years.  

I enjoy the look of the Durango, the gutty sound of the V8, I hate the feeling that the attendant at my usual gas station knows me by first name, BUT... I KNOW my kids are safe while in the back and that is all it takes.        <br><br>
