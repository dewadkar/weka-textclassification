            I have owned a number of trucks over the years.  They covered the spectrum of Ford, Chevrolet, GMC and Dodge Ram.  All were 4x4's and most were 3/4 ton.  When I decided to get a compact truck for commuting to work, I was looking for better gas mileage and better durability than my previous vehicles.  I had experienced significant warranty problems with all my past trucks.  The last one, a 95 Ram V10, spent six weeks in the shop in the first year.

I have heard many stories of high mileage Nissans without any failures. So, I was presold before I went to the dealer and did not do much of a test drive.

I found that the Nissan 4x4 had a terrific ride.  I liked the style over the other small trucks.  I soon found that it is a bit uncomfortable to travel more than a couple hundred miles at a time.  The seat is very low to provide head room.

The brakes perform better than other pickup trucks.  The CD and sound system with a subwoofer is great.  The tilt wheel with its limited travel is worthless.  

All things considered it is a good truck.  But,  I think I could have done better if I had spent more time researching the purchase.  <br><br>
