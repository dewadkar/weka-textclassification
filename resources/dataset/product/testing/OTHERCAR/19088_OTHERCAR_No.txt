            This vehicle has been a headache from the very start. I've had it for 13 months, and it has spent a full 7 of those months in the shop for various issues.

We bought the car used with only 36,000 miles on it. Three days after I got it, it overheated while waiting at a stoplight. It was still under the dealer's 30-day warranty, so we took it back to find out what was going on. They had the car for a month and a half, replacing the radiator, power steering pump, muffler, and fixing the air bag and check engine lights, which never went off.

I got the car back at the beginning of February. It ran fine, minus a moderate antifreeze smell (but no overheating), until mid-May. I parked it at 9:00 pm, went into the library and worked until 5:00 am, and when I went out to start the car, the check engine light came on and stayed. The car was idling and running VERY roughly, so I took it to the shop. They replaced the spark plugs and I went to pick the car up. Halfway home, it started doing the same rough idling/running thing, so I turned around and brought it back to the shop. Long story short, they had it for a month and a half trying to diagnose and fix the problem. They replaced several parts, most notably the oxygen sensors and the fuel injectors. 

The fuel injectors did the trick from the beginning of July until the end of September, when the same rough idling/running started again. My family tried to drive the car two hours to our home, but only made it about half an hour before they had to be towed home. The car has been in the shop from September 28 until today, January 29, and it still isn't fixed. Virtually every part has been replaced, and the dealership that was working on it flat out told us that there is so much wrong with it that it can't be fixed. 

Aside from all the mechanical problems plaguing this car, it's been very comfortable and fun to drive. I regularly took road trips of about three hours in it, and never had a problem with seat comfort. One thing I would like to see is an armrest on the driver's right/passenger's left side. Leg room for passengers in the rear is adequate, although most of the friends who have ridden in the rear wouldn't recommend taller people (&gt;5'9" or so) spending a great deal of time in the back seat.

With the rear seats in the normal riding position, there isn't a huge amount of cargo space. It would be fine for everyday things like toting groceries, but for a trip with lots of luggage you'd need to fold the back seat up. That said, you can put a lot more than you'd think into the cargo area with the back seats out of the way. I loaded the back with the head and footboards from a twin bed, a 5' tall dresser, a 4'x4'x1' hutch, and the baseboard from the bed when I moved this summer. I wouldn't recommend driving long distances loaded down like that, as your rear view is significantly obstructed, but it was fine for driving across an apartment complex.

Controls are well-placed and easy to figure out. I like the variable speed feature on the intermittent windshield wiper setting. I can't think of anything I would change control-wise on the vehicle.

The ride was more truck-like than car-like; when going over rough or unpaved roads it could get quite bouncy. I've never taken it off-road, but I have used the 4x4 mode in ice, snow, and a muddy parking lot. It was wonderful in the snow; no slipping at all. There was moderate slipping in the ice and the mud, but I never got stuck, even when starting from a standstill. As far as turning goes, the vehicle has a great turning radius, and I never felt like I was going to tip over during a turn.

The brakes weren't "grabby" or slow to respond; they were at a happy medium between the two. I never had to slam the breaks to stop in an emergency, so I'm not sure how they'd do in that situation. I didn't notice any major difference in stopping time between this vehicle and the 1991 Grand Am I used to drive - except when it was loaded with cargo, of course.

Gas mileage when I got the car was about 19 mpg combination city/highway. After I had the fuel injectors replaced, it went up to about 22 mpg city/highway.
