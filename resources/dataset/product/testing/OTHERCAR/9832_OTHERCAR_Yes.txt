            After two years of research and countless test drives, I read about the European debut of this marvelous Korean car that had the high praises of nearly everyone who test drove it and had their opinion published. 
I test drove it and compared it against station wagons made by Ford, Kia, Subaru, and Volvo (which I have owned up until now).  What I found was a solid car with bountiful options and solid safety and quality features that could not be matched by any other station wagon priced within $8,000.00 of it US.
I love the full backed soft leather seats...and the way they extend the leather onto the side panels for a full luxurious look and feel.  I love the sound system with CD, Cassette and AM/FM radio which can be blasted at full volume to either 'lite up' a large outdoor party area or simply to warm your eardrums when your alone inside the car...speaking of which, even when it is turned up quite loud inside, the car next to you doesn't have to hear your music!
Turning radius out performs all other cars that I drove.  Ride smoothness and comfort, which includes an outstanding responsive yet sporty ride and a driver's seat with 8 comfort adjustments.  Every amenity found in the mid-range luxury cars for 10-15k more!  Quiet at highway speeds.  Absolutely perfect control under extreme stopping conditions with the 4 wheel ABS..(90mph-0mph without losing ability to steer easily while avoiding a hapless doe that leapt out into the highway).  Head-lights and standard fog lights that illuminate the whole outdoors! Room enough for 4 passengers, 2 large dogs and luggage for all! Extra compartments for your own tools and ? back by the full spare.  Rock solid rack on top for function as well as looks.  And dual front air bags just to name a few of the options that make this car spectacular for the price.
Quality oozes from the well fitted cracks of this car that has been already heartily tested and accepted as a peer on the toughest paved roads in the World...the autobahn.
There are a few things I would like them to change, thought.  The paint coating is a bit thin and susceptible to chips and scratches where only 'rubbing' should occur.  Dent resistant panels should be put over the vulnerable highly styles panels of the body.  Longer warrantee should be a must to compete with the other manufacturers (not that I think I will ever need it!) Better quality tires (36,000mi. warrantee tires were included) such as all weather 50k or better so that there is one less think to think about during the Warrantee period.
To drive this car is to experience a Champagne car on a beer budget!  Comfort, quiet and 'softness' for the same money that buys: rigid, noisy and bumpy in it's nearest competitor, the Kia.  More room than the Taurus or the the Subaru.  I've already put 5k on the car in all weather and on all kinds of roads and have been absolutely impressed with it's power to keep up in the mountain passes as well as to glide over rough road and stop at a moment's notice.  
Pay special attention to the unique transmission, the 'made for high speeds' suspension that corners like a deer and the aggressive engine that all work together to make this car a pleasure to drive.
Families that need room should check this out!  Sell the mini-van and move into a little luxury and economy.  Businessmen who haul displays and product from place to place and need the mileage and low upkeep should definitely check this out! (especially if you need to impress a client from time to time!)  Anyone who is looking for a station wagon and just can't believe the prices of all those 'affordable' options out there...should save $10k or more here!<br><br>
