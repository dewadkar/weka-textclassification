            The brand new Mitsubishi Eclypse is out there on the market finally.  With the highly anticipated new look for the year 2000.  Mitsubishi does an amazing job with making this car even look better.  With blending the 3000GT's muscle body with the smaller eclypse, Mitsubishi manages to keep this cars style appealing to all ages.  

And the best part is, the price is with in 20,000 dollars.  Most people often believe that just because a car looks good, and drives good, that the price must be ridiculious.  But I happen to believe that the Eclypse has proven that theory wrong.  Staying at a inexpensive price, and still keeping it's beauty.  

Just for some quick advice, if your looking to hook up your car's exterior, I wouldn't worry about the skirt of the model.  Because most people will agree that you would be crazy to even think about doing so... Also the car is a hatchback, so making your car pump bass will be a lot cheaper.  The bass manages to just ride up the glass, and avoid that horrible rattling noise.
