            That is what happened when I drove the Cadillac Escalade across three states. Absolutely one of the best choices for a SUV! This is the top of the line of course, primo all the way, in all of the so very fine features. This ride has class that will make you feel like you just never want to stop driving a Cadillac. The Escalade has a sleeping like quality, with a smooth ride and one of the very most quiet vehicles I have ever driven without a doubt! 
There is great durability and reliability over time with this Escalade I hear. You might want to go and at least test drive one of these. You will see the greatness of this quality Cadillac! I have not seen or driven anything that even compares with this one in awhile, but one is scheduled soon!  I am looking forward to having the wonderful opportunity to again slide across the scenery of this country with some smoke to match the quality of this one! <br><br>
