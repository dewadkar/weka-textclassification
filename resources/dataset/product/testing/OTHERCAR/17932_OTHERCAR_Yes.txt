            When my family was looking for a luxury car we started with BMW, Lexus, Acura, Audi, and Mercedes.   We had exhausted our possibilities and could not find one that suited our needs at the price we wanted.  Then while on the road we spotted a Toyota Avalon, it looked like a Lexus but was a Toyota.  When we went to the dealer and saw the price we knew it was the car we wanted.  Our former car had been a Pontiac Bonneville and we wanted something the next step up.  The Avalon satisfies every expectation.  
When driving in incliment weather the car handles nicely and doesn't fishtail.  I have been involved in an accident in the car and came out without a scratch.  The car is well equipped with leather, CD/Cassette, heated seats, power everything, and remote keyless entry.  If one is looking for something to bridge the gap between luxury and affordabilty in a car here is what you are looking for.
