            I now own my second Chevrolet Blazer. The first, a 1997 two door door LS, had transmission problems form the first day. In fact the company had to replace the transmission, which they did at no cost to me, but the replacement transmission had different gearing and the gas mileage suffered as a result. My second Blazer, a 4 door LS, 1998 model has over 43,000 miles on it. I drive it everywhere and often. I have had no problems with this car and it is fun to drive. The gas mileage is good ( my range is 16 to 20 miles per gallon) , it parks easily, and need be it moves very quickly.<br><br>
