            I bought my 99 Malibu about a month ago.  I was replacing my Mustang I had driven for about 2 years.  Needless to say I was a little worried about going from a sports car to a passenger car, but it was about time for a new ride (the wife was complaining.)

The first thing I noticed when I test drove the Malibu right off the lot was the acceleration.  Wow, what a spunky little monkey for only having four cylinders.  The engine is a little raspy sounding.  You know, kinda like the life long smoker voice (just not quite right),  but I've gotten used to it now.  

Gas mileage has been somewhat of a disappointment though.  I thought decreasing the size of engines from a 6 in the Mustang, to a 4 cylinder in the Malibu would help.  Actually, the Malibu is getting about 27mpg on average, while the Mustang got about 32.  Hmmm....don't ask me, but it's not cool with myself personally paying more for gas a month than food.  I'm serious, but I can live with 27.

Ok, I was driving a Mustang.  It's a pretty hot car!  Now I'm driving a Malibu.  My God a family car!!!  Yeah, that's what I thought, but when my 12 year old cousin told me my new car was &quot;phat!,&quot;  I wasn't so bothered about the prospects of actually owning a 4 door.

The interior is pretty nice.  The seats are hard, but besides that all the chevy knobs are big and easy to use.  The cup holders are out of the way and more than one I might add.  Plenty of leg room was quite a pleasant change.

Overall, I think the Chevy Malibu is a great car for the money.  I don't think I could have done any better for what I paid.  I am very pleased with the vehicle and its performance so far.  It's not a sports car,  but it might surprise you how much pep it actually has.  I would suggest this car to anyone looking for a moderately priced passenger car, looking for that extra punch in the city without sacrificing too much in gas mileage.<br><br>
