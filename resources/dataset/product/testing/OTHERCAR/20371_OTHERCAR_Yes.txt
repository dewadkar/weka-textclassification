            Mazda finally came up with an all new SUV that will most likely make their sales go up, the new Tribute is on the list of many potential buyers of SUVs and sport wagons.  I noticed the luxurious interior and a royal rounded shape of the headlights and the whole car body is aerodynamic and cool.  Handling and driving is superb just like any one would expect from a luxurious SUV.  With all the options and tinted windows you will end up spending over twenty thousand dollars which is kind of high for some of us but is relatively reaonable on the market of SUVs.  Mazda is similar in some way with Ford Explorer, a U.S. best-selling  SUV.  Remember Mazda SUV that was rare but looked exactly like ford Explorer at that time?
Controls and visibility are great for average sized person, seats are comfortable for short drives and long trips
You have to think if you really need this car, it's not the best buy for a big family, get a mini-van, more tageted to younger buyers, those who want zip and zoom.<br><br>
