            Nissan finally decides to get serious about the SUV market and releases the Xterra, a brand new addition to a tired automotive line.  I suppose that Nissan designers thought that since sales have been so low, they might as well build a car people will buy.  The Xterra is a big leap in that direction.

For your money, you get a great deal more than competing SUVs in that class.  Never mind the Explorer unless you want to do cartwheels down the freeway.  Have you had a chance to read the reviews of the Chevy Blazer (aka GMC Jimmy).. read reviews from past owners and you'll notice that they hate their cars because they fall apart.  Cars like the Passport, 4runner and Montero Sport have price ranges way out of Xterra's league.

So, frankly, for your money, there's no other option.  The Xterra is IT, and you're not settling for less if you elect to buy it.

<b>Exterior</b>
Let's face it, the exterior styling is <i>sexy</i>.  It breaks away from the boxy, soccer-mom, raised station-wagon look that is so prevalent in the lot of today's blah SUV lines.  You may not be a mountain-climber, you may never take this car off-road, but you will sure look like you did if you didn't wash it!  I would only change the front grille to be color coordinated with the rest of the car (instead of plastic-black).

<b>Interior</b>
For me, the interior styling was the big minus.  It was just like the Frontier, the Xterra's sister pickup truck in the Nissan line.  Utilitarian, simple and rugged, the interior lacks the refinement that most other SUVs have.  But frankly, as a Sport &quot;Utility&quot; Vehicle, the Xterra doesn't <i>have</i> to have the car-like amenities.  If you want a nicer interior (and are ready to pay for it), check out the Pathfinder (I reviewed that one too).

That said, I think that the neatest thing about the Xterra's interior is the stadium seating -- where the rear seats are elevated just a bit higher than the front.  It makes sitting in the backseat fun (for some reason, I can't quite pin it down).

<b>Engine</b>
Ok, here's the weird part: the Xterra comes with a v6-170hp engine.  It's &quot;just enough&quot; power.  Acceleration leaves much to be desired, especially on the freeway.  And there's no way that Nissan is going to put the 240hp Maxima/Pathfinder engine in the Xterra so this is quite the odd paradox.  There are rumors, though, that Nissan is going to have a supercharger as an option to the SE.

<b>Ride</b>
It rides just like a truck. Period.

<b>Other Considerations</b>
It seems that Nissan has changed the body style of the Frontier, the model the Xterra was styled after, and I wonder what effect that will have on the Xterra's future design.  If you're planning to purchase this car right away, you might want to check out the new Frontier and see if you'd like to wait for the new style change (if there is one).

I actually didn't buy the Xterra.  When we were coming back from the test-drive (the salesman took us off-roading - what a goofball), we wanted to try out the Pathfinder &quot;for fun.&quot; We loved it so much that we bought that instead.
