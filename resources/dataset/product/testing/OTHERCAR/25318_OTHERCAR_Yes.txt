            I have a 1990 Geo Metro.  The car runs great and is fun to drive.  It gets around 42 miles to the gallon, when driven at 75 miles per hour on long trips!  It has no problem doing 80 to 85 miles per hour (unlike what some people imply), though the handling does start to deteriorate at 85 (it steers very quickly w/oversteer).  Parts are cheap and the car is very easy to maintain (look at how much room there is in the engine compartment!).

I am 6'1&quot; and fit into the front and back comfortable with no problems.  That car is a hatchback and works well for moving small to moderate sized furniture (including dressers and desks).  Twin mattresses will fit...but only if you are a midget driver or if you have them tied-in with the hatch open.  

I recommend Geo Metros to most people as their primary car.  People who regularly (daily) need to transport more than 4 people at a time might need something bigger.  

I highly recommend 3 cylinder 5 speed Geo Metro Hatchbacks as the best value in mass produced cars in the United States.<br><br>
