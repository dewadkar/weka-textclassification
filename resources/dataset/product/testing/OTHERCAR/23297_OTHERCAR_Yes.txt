            The 1990 Cavalier that I owned was my first car.  That car had been through the ownership of three different people before my mother gave it to me in 1996.  It always worked.

My uncle first owned, when it was brand new.  He used it as a business car, in which he would make regular trips to Tennessee, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and Florida, from Central Illinois.  He took excellent care of the blue, two door Cavalier.  He is hooked on Cavaliers.  He buys a new cavalier every three years, and has yet to encounter any major problems with them.

My mother bought it from him, in 1993.  It then took a lot of wear and tear, but it never had any major breakdowns.  

In 1995 my aunt used it to cart around her four kids.  The only problem she encountered was a leaky radiator, at around the 200,000 mile mark on the odometer.

When I owned the car, it handled well, consumed very little gas, and never gave me any engine trouble.  The anti-lock brake system never failed me.  It ran until someone (not me) rolled it in a ditch on a state highway, going sixty miles per hour.  The driver survived with minimal injuries, but the car was determined to be totaled.  I think this says something positve for the safety of the car.

The front seats were pretty comfortable, but the back was not meant for tall individuals (6 feet and up).  This car is quite comparable to the 1993 Cavalier.  I recommend this vehicle for teenagers and small to medium sized families.
