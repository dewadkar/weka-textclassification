             I must first mention the Aerosmith music that made me watch the commercial for the Ram in the first place.  Catchy tune, catchy title ("Mayor of Truckville"), and good-looking truck!  
I have always wanted a pick up, but having two little boys, it was not practical.  The stories about the dangers of car seats in extended cab pick ups, the the tight spaces made it impossible.  That all changed when the Quad cabs, or Crew cabs, came along.
I looked at Ford F150's but they were a little higher in price, and at the time, offered no real interest incentives.  Dodge offered 0% for the life of the loan, 7 year/70,000 mile powertrain warranty, and a business owner rebate. 
The newly designed front grille really adds to this year's model.  The rear doors open much farther than those in the past.  They have exterior handles, meaning the front doors do not have to be opened in order to access the rear.  The seats are comfortable, all of the controls are easy to reach, the ride is smooth, and outside noise is kept to a minimum.  
For families, there is enough room for two car seats in the back, and an adult to sit comfortably next to them.  The center console is in the front middle seat when folded down.  If needed, this can be raised and a smaller youth (older than 12 per air-bag requirements) could sit in the middle but has very little leg room.  For the hunters, the rear floor provides enough room for a 30.06 in a case and a lot of hunting necessities.   There is plenty of room in the bed, as I have used it to haul plywood, 2x4's, deer corn, a small fireplace, and insulation.  There's also a rear storage compartment under the back seat.
