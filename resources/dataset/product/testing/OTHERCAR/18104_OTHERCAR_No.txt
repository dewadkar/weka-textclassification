            I originally purchased this vehicle (a Dodge Neon) because it was cheaper than its competition and offered higher gas mileage.

I loved the 40+ mpg that I would get out of the Neon at highway speeds and I cannot complain about the 30+ mpg in the city.  However, the outstanding gas mileage did not warrant the Neon to begin to fall apart after 70,000 in just 2 1/2 years.  First the A/C, then &quot;nothing was wrong with it&quot; per the dealer, but it would need a new battery ever 3 days and begin making odd sounds.  However, since mechanics just plug the car into a machine, instead of looking under the hood, nothing was &quot;wrong&quot; with it.

I sold this vehicle as soon as I had a couple of months were I spent 4 times as such a month in maintenance than I was on my car payments.  I am now extremely comfortable in a Honda Civic.

It was a ok car to drive, nothing special about it though.

In my e-pinion, no one should ever buy this vehicle.<br><br>
