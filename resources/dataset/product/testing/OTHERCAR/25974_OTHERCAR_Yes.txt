                    My daughter calls me at work one day and tells me her car is getting old and nothing works on it anymore! Her car at the time is a '90 Dodge Colt. I said lets go looking for a car, and I think it should be a new one because you get the warranty, and nobody else has owned it, she agreed. We looked at quite a few cars before going to Chevrolet, what took us to Chevrolet was a financing special that GMAC had going, they do this about once a year. The car that fell into her range was the 2000 Cavalier, and we took it for a drive. It was nice and with the rebates being offered she bought the car for $10,000, you could not buy the used '99 for this price. Now that she has been driving it for a while we find it is great in snow, it gets great fuel economy, and it has a good ride but not great a little stiff, the car is roomy in the front and back. This car is a 2-door coupe and the doors are very heavy and big difficult to open in tight areas, also if you have snow on top of the car you need to get it off before you open the door because some of the snow is going to be in the seat, because there is nothing to stop it. But overall it is a good economical car for a single or married couple with no children.<br><br>
