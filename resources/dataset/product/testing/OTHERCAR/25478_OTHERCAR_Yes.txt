            I purchased a new Saturn SL2 in 1998.  So far it has been the best new car I have ever purchased.  Two years and thirty thousand miles later I have only one complaint - the air conditioning.  While the car cools reasonably well the positioning of the vents is not the best.  Being from Texas this can be a bit of a problem.  As far as service goes Saturn is the best.  The techs and office workers are invariably helpful and I have not had the need to make any major repairs.  All in all I would recommend the Saturn SL2 to my friends and family - despite the problem with the AC.<br><br>
