            I bought my Saturn in 2000. It was a 1998 with 24k miles on it and it cost $10,000. That included a 50k mile bumper to bumper warranty.  Saturn dealers do not pressure you as much as other dealerships, and there are no pricing hassles. The sticker price is usually a fair price, so the salesman cannot take advantage of you.  

It gets great gas mileage (about 35 mpg in city, and 41 mpg freeway).  Saturns do not have timing belts (they have timing chains), so the timing belt will never break.  I have only experienced a few bad things. There is a rattle that they cannot seem to fix.  Also, the blinker is very hard to activate, you almost have to use your whole hand to use it.  It may not seem like a big deal, but when you use it often it does begin to bug you. The clutch much more difficult to use than most other cars I've driven.  Also, for being a small car, it has a large turning radius so dont expect to make sharp turns easily.

It is a compact car, so its not considerably roomy, but it seems to have a lot more space inside than other compact cars.
