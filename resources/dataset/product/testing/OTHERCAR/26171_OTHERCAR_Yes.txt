            I'm about to turn 18 now and I've owned 2 Lincoln Mark VII's, I am absolutely in love with my current 90' LSC Special Edition.  But be warned, this car takes alot of money to keep maintained, and alot of hard work.  But the feeling you get from owning one is unlike any other.  Beware of the following when your thinking about buying one.  These cars air-ride suspension are as delicate as fine china, be sure to get a chance to see the car BEFORE its started after it has been imobile for a few days, if one end is sagging or sinking, forget it, your asking for trouble.  Another thing is be sure to take it for a test drive and crank up the heat to 90, turn the fan to high, and set it to defrost your windsheild, this is a way to find out if the Heater Core is bad, (Ive had both heater cores go bad on my cars) I don't care if it's 90 out, you'll be able to smell the anti-freeze if you dont see it on the windshield and be ready to spend a good $500-$600 in repairs to fix it.  Other then that, if you find one under 100,000 for less then $5,000 thats in good condition, I say take it!<br><br>
