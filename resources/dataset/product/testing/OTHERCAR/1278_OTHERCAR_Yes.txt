            I bought this product to replace my older Nikon camera that decided to no longer accept film.  I wanted a camera that could come as close as possible to matching the resolution of 35mm film and the Nikon 990 does a good job.  However I DO have a few complaints.  The first one is that the camera is far too picky about the lighting conditions.  I believe this is due to the small lens and it's inability to collect enough light.  Another complaint I have is the relatively small optical zoom.  I was disappointed by the digital zoom feature and have landed up turning it off because it looses so much quality.  Finally the lack of a Type II compact flash slot makes expanding the camera's storage very expensive since you cannot use the 340mb IBM microdrive.  I would recommend this camera to studio photographers and avid amateur photographers since it offers manual control for both aperture and shutter speed.
