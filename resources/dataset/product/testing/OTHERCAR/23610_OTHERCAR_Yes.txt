            When I bought my Dodge Intrepid and decided that this will be the time of a one in a life -time change, I thought, how about a big nice looking car for a change? Well, this was the perfect one. I looked around for a long time before finding this one, my 1993 Intrepid.   for a reasonable price I bough it. It had 63,000 miles at the time of purchase, but I liked it. With the 3.3L V6, it was very fast, compared to the other card I had in the past, the only thing was that the mileage wasn�t as great as I expected, but it was still worth it. On the other hand, everything else compensated for the gas mileage. This car has easily the biggest space in back seats I've seen in any car, it also had a build in child sit a plus to me because we had our first child at the time of purchase. When I sat on the back of the car for the first time I didn�t mind because I felt like if I was in the front seat. To me it beats any other car rear seat space. And with four doors it couldn�t be any better, this is a good car for you. The trunk is enormous as well. The mileage gets better as you drive highway - cruising at 75 mph typically produced around 28-30 mpg. Compared to the newest models that have better engines and that gets better mileage per gallon with more horsepower. This one still stands out over a lot of them. As for reliability, like I said I bought it with 63,000 miles on it, but it never gave me any trouble at all, I drove it from California across the country to North Carolina and never gave me any trouble, if fact I still have my great 1993 Intrepid with 132,000 on it and the only mayor Maintenance I had to perform in it was change of transmission at 126,000 which it was expected, and change of a new starter about three weeks ago, oh now that I remember the car had a little leak in the cooling system but I fix a product which seals cooling systems leaks for the cost of $8.00 dollars I did it my self. By now I am expecting something else to go wrong with my car, but it has not yet, so my car it�s the only thing that has not let me down yet. I personal believe is car last as long as you take good care of them and this one have save so much money in my pocket that you won�t believe.
