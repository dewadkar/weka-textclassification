                I have had my 1999 Toyota Camry for about 18 months now and can say that it is, without question, the best automobile, for the money, that I have ever driven.
    Nothing seems to ever go wrong with this car.  Unlike some vehicles, which I have owned in the past, I haven't encountered even the smallest difficulty....no rattles, no leaks, no wind noise, etc.
    For a four cylinder, this car has amazing power and merges into interstate traffic with ease.  I keep very close track of my gas mileage and, in town, average approximately 20 MPG.  On the highway, I've enjoyed as much as 33 MPG with an average over 30.
    The folks at Toyota have done an excellent job in styling, as this car looks as much at home at the country club, as it does down on the farm.  It is only a few features short of its cousin, the Lexus ES300, with a price tag some $13,000 lower.  
    You just can go wrong with this car.<br><br>
