            I showed the salesman the ad for the 1999 Plymouth Voyager. It came from the leading Twin cities news paper. I asked him if 14,900 dollars was right. It was for a stripped machine. He didn't have any like that in stock. I told him that the one advertised was the one I wanted, no other. It took three days to find the one we wanted. They shipped it in from out of state. Funny thing, huh? Was this bait and switch?
   I joyfully watched my wife drive it off the showroom floor after being pressured to buy their extended warranty. In my opinion, if you buy new and take care of anything properly you don't need a warranty. But does anybody really do that? It lacks a few niceties like no tape deck, no tinted windows, no cruise. But what the heck with the price of new cars these days, we love it. We also own a 1989 Plymouth Voyager and it still runs. Granted , the 89' is known for having bad head valves. Just keep oil in it and don't go out of town. We had to keep it, they obviously didn't want it. The warranty they gave us on that used car was worthless. When I went to get the oil problem investigated, they weren't thorough enough and wouldn't accept the proof of the problem.
   The electrical on the old van is pathetic. Electric locks failed years ago just after the warranty expired. WE can't get a key that will work without replacing the entire system. I only hope that our new car doesn't have these problems in the long run.<br><br>
