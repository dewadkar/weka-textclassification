            I absolutly love this suv. I bought because I'm more of an outdoor person and I love trucks but I also have a wife and two kids. It works great with the kids the Mrs. loves to drive it and I love all the sporty extras. I hate the bumpy ride though. It is a little bumpy and the interior is a little sketchy but other than  that it handles ok. People who like trucks and suv's at the same time should buy this. People who shouldn't would be people who like a smooth ride and clean people shoudn't. I recomend this for any body who likes the great outdoors.<br><br>
