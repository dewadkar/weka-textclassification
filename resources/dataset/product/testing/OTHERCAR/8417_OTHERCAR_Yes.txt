            I compared this product to the Canon A50, S10, &amp; Nikon CoolPix 800. I researched various sites and found identical images posted in full format by the aforementioned products. I also went to various dealers for hands on experimentation, and even bought a CoolPix 800 and returned it in just a couple days (reasons to follow).
I stumbled into the camera at Sam's Club NEW for only $399. I've had it about 2 weeks and have taken all kinds of images with it, and compared the same to identical pictures with the CoolPix I bought. While the Nikon with ALOT of coaxing in software and such could make a nice image with a tiny bit better resolution, by and large it can't hold a candle to the overall color and sharpness of the Olympus. 
I got comments from casual users, to friends who are pros, and all favored the images from the Olympus 10-1 over the Nikon. Nikon was hard to use also, no TWAIN driver (have to cut and paste) real pain, VERY poor viewfinder on Nikon. Some of us wear bi-focals (WAKE UP NIKON), and trying to get shots focused/composed on the LCD screen is a pain at best! Very weak zoom on Nikon and Canons (only 2x). Canon way too small to use comfortably and making nose prints on LCD.  
As far as bad points on the Olympus, 1. Tech Support Why can't they put people on the help desks that speak English?! 2. The Camedia software loads OLD DLL files over the newer Win 98 ones essentially causing a real pain in the butt. Don't use it! If Win 95 probably OK. 3. Autofocus is not the greatest, sometimes locks on who knows what, or not at all. In fairness here the coditions that fool the Olympus gave the Nikon fits too. Just not as bad. 4. Olympus should upgrade the camera free for the newer cards not the $69.95. 5. DON'T use Alkaline batteries. It sucked down 2 sets of them to download 3 high res images. Found High output NIMH set of 4 with charger at Radio Shack for $19.95, and bought second set for $9.95. Best way to go they last a LONG time.
Otherwise the BEST unit I've seen for less than $800.<br><br>
