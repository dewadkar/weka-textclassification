            I have no experience with many other digital cameras, but I don't know where I'd be without this one. I am an architecture graduate student and purchased this camera almost two years ago. I had traveled abroad with this camera to Italy for said major for five months (and throughout the rest of Europe) and had taken well over 3000 pictures. Now, I travel back and forth to Cleveland, Ohio to take in part of that city. Recently, I had to blow buildings up to a scale all 30mm photographs would have looked sloppy as from a Xerox machine -- these looked great. 

The camera is small enough to carry everywhere but large enough to handle (for bigger persons). The flash doesn't work that well it seems (in fact I don't even use it at night) but the pictures are almost always top quality. Try not to move around too much, though, while taking a shot at darker periods of the day.

The battery life seems to be terrible (in fact, it uses about a half of the batteries and shuts off) so I recommend rechargeables and backups if you're planning to be out for the whole day. Two AA batteries will last around 3 hours, but in those three hours you can take as many pictures as needed.

The camera comes with a great, easy-to-use software program called "Photostitch" which basically stitches panoramic shots automatically. These pans can come out perfect (I've got Italy pics to prove it) if the photographer at least has a clue. 

I see no reason to buy a new camera, digital or standard, until this one breaks.
