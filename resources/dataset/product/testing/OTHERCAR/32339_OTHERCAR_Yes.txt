            I love Acura, and I love my SLX.  It has some glitches (after all, it really is a gussied up Isuzu).  For instance, it always feels as though the brakes are going out, or the spring in the drivers seat is going to pop through the leather at any time now.  Not to mention the damage my bumper showed by bumping into a sign post or the dent in my wallet every time I pull into the gas station.

Putting the above aside, I find my four-wheeler to be solid and comfortable.  The seats are great on a long trip, especially for tall people like myself.  The only gripe I have for the seats is that the armrest is too high which puts my elbow and shoulder out of balance with the steering wheel.  Other than that, there is plenty of room for five with lots of luggage.  The sound system is very easy to use (a little bit harder than my Legend, but still easy to use).  

This is a great vehicle for anyone wanting luxury at an affordable price.  I got mine on a lease which was heavily discounted by Honda.  With 1999 being the last year of production and the new model arriving in August 2000, Acura is sure to discount the rest of the stock.  If you can get the lease for under $400 per month, it is definitely the best value out there.

One last word, make sure you get a bug deflector included in the lease.  The flat front of the hood attracts bugs and nicks.  <br><br>
