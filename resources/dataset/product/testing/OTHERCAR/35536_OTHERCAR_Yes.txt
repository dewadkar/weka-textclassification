            Digitally speaking, I have had a Minola Dimage, a very bad camera, camera shots off a Sony Digital Video; good but only minimal resolution, and a Fuji 2700; excellent 2 megapixel quality but no zoom! I had used these cameras as company purchases and now it was time to buy my own! 

I went back to first principals and compared my needs against the Canon S300, the Sony PC1 ( I think thats the name), the Nikon CoolPix 995 and the Fuji 6800. Over many years of photography including video, regular and digital I have found convenience has overruled quality nearly everytime. My cameras sit on my kitchen shelf fully charged and ready to grab and shoot, anytime. No cases and paraphanalia. Size is important. If I can't stick it in my heavily laden pockets (cell phone, wallet, keys, occasional PDA) then it doesn't come with me. If I need high quality I have the Pentax SLR with all the lenses, so a digital has to be right now, right here, right convenient. 

So my criteria for a digital camera are simple:
size (pocketable), zoom ( at least 3x), quality image that is computer editable (at least 3 megs and Mac compatible), and intuitive (no endless menus and odd logic). 
Nice to have:
long life lithium battery, very high capacity memory card, strong flash, built in lens cover, video capability, other custom features like neat playback, in camera editting etc.

Cost is secondary as if the above isn't met, you won't use the camera no matter how cheap or expensive it is.

Comparators:
Nikon CoolPix 995 has a great 4X zoom. That is it's best feature. It is simply too large to pocket. It has a heap of customizable features, but who cares if you don't bring it anywhere.
Sony PC1: Pretty cool, small, does video. Apparently the memory sticks are still small. Technology is about 12 months old which is a lot in this business. But a very close contender, and cheaper than the Fuji. Fuji's images are better with color rendition better right off the mark.
Canon S300: Pretty cool too, slightly smaller than the Fuji but with only a 2 megapixel image. It was a very close call between the Canon, Sony and Fuji. Cheaper too.

I must admit my bias towards Fuji because I had taken a huge number of photos with the 2700 and was very impressed by the quality. The 128 meg Smart media card I bought offers 1300 pictures of computer resolution or 100 images of 8x10 high resolution or 15 minutes of video (Quicktime) or nearly 6 hours of audio recording. The one with the camera at 8 megs is ridiculously small. The holder that charges the camera also seamlessly links the camera to the computer for incredibly fast transfers, or live video recordings. It is really nice to use, especially compared to the outrageously slow pre-USB serial transfers. NEVER bother with those! It's like 5 minutes per picture versus 5 secs for this unit. 

The logic is simple and versatile on the camera. Once you know a couple of rules the remainder are intuitive and easily understood on the display panel. The 3x zoom at high res becomes a 10x zoom at lower resolutions, but the quality is still excellent. I am totally impressed by the quality under the low resolution, a good printer does a great job of these.

Disappointments?: Only 1. The video is slightly clunky to read off the computer. Sometimes my IMac sends me error messages to read the AVI files, and the video conference feature for internet camera use is strictly PC, no Mac compatibility (although this is never mentioned in the advertising). 

Although the Canon had the edge in size, the ability to edit a 3 megapixel versus 2 for the Canon beats it out for later image manipulation. The Sony's technology is first generation and the image transfer and video functions aren't as smooth as Fuji. Nikon is too big. I looked at Olympus and Kodak too, both were too big for similar cameras.

Although technology is always changing, I think 3 megapixels (this unit can do 6 through internal software tricks) is very satisfactory and doesn't overload your computer when it comes to editting or storing. The size may decrease, but too small leads to camera shake. Bottom line; this seems to be evrything I would want in a digital camera; if it were a few hundred bucks less and fully Mac compatible it would be perfect!
