                 With just a perfunctory glance, you might think that this is just another 3 series coupe/sedan but those who know, KNOW!  This car is nearly totally balanced in hp/torque and weight distribution and to drive it is a pleasure for four out of the five senses.  It may look like a &quot;grocery getter&quot; but it can easily out handle most anything on the road and the same goes for acceleration.  Many of the cars that are sold as &quot;sports cars&quot; I've left behind at many a stop light/sign.  
     On the first M3's with the 3.0 liter engine the low end torque was fairly lacking but since trading up to the '98 3.2 liter engine I get an immense thrill every time I put my foot into it.  The traction control (which is easily disabled with a flick of a switch for more aggressive driving) is another good reason to buy one of the newer models of the M series.  My '95 model was all over the road whenever it rained and especially in the snow but while my '98 still does slip some it is much more controlled in inclement weather.
     Now this car isn't perfect though.  I have had my complaints, but they are small in comparison to the performance the it offers.  I bought the upgraded Harmon/Kardon sound system and have been less than satisfied with its performance.  As to date, I have had to have the right front midrange woofer replaced four times because of being blown (and no, I don't listen to the stereo obnoxiously loud) and the tweeters have a real hard time reproducing violins and soprano voices without significant distortion.  For the price you pay for the upgrade you could probably get much better performance for just a little bit more money at a good high quality audio salon.  I have also had a lot of problems with annoying squeaks and rattles in the dash and at this price point that shouldn't be a problem.  I also can't get the brakes to stop squealing despite the dealer replacing the brakes.  Their explanation of these problems was that this is a high performance sports car and I should expect to have some quirks.  Although I don't like it, I will put up with the small idiosyncrasies, at least until they finally come out with the body style of M3 later this year.  
     While this car isn't perfect, it comes closer than any car that I have ever driven before and I don't see myself driving anything else other than M3's for quite some time to come.  <br><br>
