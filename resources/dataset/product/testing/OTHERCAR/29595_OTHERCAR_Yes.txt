            This vehicle is great for kids. This Van is a must have for all families with two or more kids who need space and love to travel by road. It comes with a 9 speaker sound system. The only problem with this mini van is that they do not offer it in 4 wheel drive. The two door feature helps when you have kids climbing in and out of the vehicle. The seats are on wheels so after you disengage their locking system they roll out easily. The seat are interchangeable so you can put the three person bench seat in the middle of the van and have a huge cargo space in the back with only giving up two seats. All of the back seats can be slid back and forth or can be taken out. The trunk on this van is great, it is spacious and can be adjusten easily space wise by sliding the seats forward. 
It has enough seat belts to fit seven people but the leg and cargo space are still huge. <br><br>
