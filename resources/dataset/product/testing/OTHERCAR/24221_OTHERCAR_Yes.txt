            I bought this truck new (336 miles, actually). Here are the problems I've had in 65,000 miles of driving. 
It has had since new a squeak that you can only hear with the windows down. 
I replaced the starter ($181.00) at 60,000 miles. I do lots of short driving in the summer so....
In temperatures below 10 degrees F, the tailgate will not latch. I believe there's a technical bulletin out on this.
A seam between the back of the cab and the reach-around side was improperly sealed at the factory causing a leak and ruining the carpet pad. I was able to fix this myself.
It seems impossible to keep the front end aligned. I've talked to other people who have experienced the same thing.
Now, the good news!
I love this truck. This is the best vehicle I've ever owned. The older it gets the better it runs. Very smooth and quiet on the hiway. It always starts, the brakes are still pretty good, the seats are very comfortable. It is relatively easy to change the oil (the filter is just a little inconvenient if you're on a creeper), check the various fluid levels, etc. Load height is good.  Original stainless steel exhaust looks new. Gas mileage 18/21 in warm weather. Heater is great, A/C is OK considering it's not freon. 4-speed auto transmission can't decide on a gear sometimes but it tows really well with O/D shut off. Great visibility, power mirrors work great. If I were to lose this truck I would not hesitate to buy another. This truck is everything I hoped it would be and more. I bought it because I'm a "Dodge guy" but also because I was too cheap to get FWD and the Ford and Chevy dealers I saw didn't want to order a 2WD. Besides, their best guess at what a 2WD Ranger or S10 would go for was about $3500 more than I paid for the Dakota! This is a truck for everyone.
