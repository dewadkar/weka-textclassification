            The new Toyota Celica is sporty and fun to drive.  I bought a loaded black Celica GT about 2 weeks ago and I love it!  The best part about this car is its reliability, considering that its a Toyota.  I bought this vehicle because it was so different looking than all the other cars on the road.  Also, because I know that Toyota makes good cars.  The only problems that I came across are that there is a limited rear view (which causes some problems while merging, but nothing drastic) and that there is a pinging sound in the dashboard when i hit a bump.  Overall this car runs great and the safety features are very nice.  The daytime running lights are especially helpful for those of us who tend to leave our lights on.  I haven't gotten the car over 70mph, because I'm still babying it for the first 1000 miles.  This sports car offers an extremely smooth ride and the cabin isn't noisy, but it does let you hear the revving of the engine (which I think is good).  I would recommend that anyone from 18-30 should buy this car, I think its too sporty and young for anyone over 30 (sorry).  Trust me, this car gets lots of attention when I go out.  I constantly have people asking me about it and wanting to know how it drives.  Anyone that is interested in a reliable and fun-to drive sports car, this is your car!<br><br>
