            When the new design Cougars came out in 1999, I knew I had to get one. However, it was in the hands of my parents as they are the ones carrying the brunt of the payment book.  I am glad that I waited until 2000, as a couple of &quot;major minor&quot; changes have taken place.

The Cougar looks deceivingly small in the back seat.  I love the bucket seats in the back as they are very comfortable, even for my 6'1&quot; frame.  I am able to sit without having to worry about leg room.  However, when I am in the back seat, I do have to watch my head to make sure it does not hit the roof.  The control panel on the dash board is very techy and gives the driver a great deal of information such as distance until empty, current outside temperature, and average speed.  Another aspect I really like is the high-beams. They are extremely bright and give a good peripheral aspect of what is out there.  A major change that has taken place in the 2000 Cougar is the cup holder.  In the 1999 model, the cup holder could easily be broken as it was an &quot;add-on&quot; that had to be pulled out to be used. In 2000, it is a part of the interior, so no such issues.

Driving the Cougar is amazingly awesome.  Going from home to school and from school to home takes me three hours.  In my &quot;old&quot; 1997 Taurus, the ride would be a bore and I would actually have back aches when I got home. However, in the Cougar I have had no such problems.  I can jet by slower traffic with my V6 automatic transmission and there is little hesitation by the car.

My parents agree (my father has worked with vehicles for over 25 years) that the Cougar is a lot of bang for the buck.  Imagine a V6 170-HP very sporty sleek looking car for under $20,000.  You get that with the Cougar<br><br>
