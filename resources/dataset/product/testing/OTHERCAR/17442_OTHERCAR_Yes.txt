            Perfect! The one word answer to describe my 1999 Honda Passport.
I was getting ready to graduate high school and I thought to myself, &quot;I think it is time that I start paying for my own things instead of mom and dad doing it for me.&quot; 
I told them that I wanted to buy myself a used car. I found out that my father had purchased the Passport for me to use during college. I was surprised, but I still offered to pay for it. He told me that I didn't have to. I said I wanted to. 
Now, I am starting to pay him back and I am still using the car. I love it. The Passport is very comfortable. It is a little bumpy, but not too bad. The best thing about it is that during winter most cars take a good 15-20 mins. to warm up all the way. The Passport take a maximum of 10 mins. I love that. The speakers are a major downfall if you like loud music. They sound distorted if you turn the volume up too loud. To take care of that problem, I installed two Rockford Fosgate 12 inch subwoofers.
It has 5 seats, so there is plenty of room for passengers. I would like to see the passport with a V-8 engine, but a V-6 will do.
Over all, I love this car and I think that anyone who bought it would love it also. The price is great. If you are looking for an affordable SUV, then the Honda Passport is the car for you!<br><br>
