            I have a 1999, teal green, Chevy Cavalier. This car has been the most faithful car that I have ever driven! I bought it fresh off the lot with less than 1000 miles on it last year. I have driven it from interstates to narrow, country roads. This car has lasted through many harsh conditions and I am thankful to be the proud owner of this quality car. Chevrolet is a very good brand has proven to have outstanding, well-manufactured cars. I intend on trading in the car I own now for another Chevy Cavalier that is up to date with the present year. I defnitley recommend this car to anyone who wants to have a dependable car for their family use along with their own personal enjoyment. The only regret I have is that I wish it had a cd player!! <br><br>
