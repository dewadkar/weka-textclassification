            Well, it is no surprise by my title how I feel about my Saturn. I have a 1997 SL2, with a few of the perks that this model offers...Initially we bought the car because it drove well, and ranked well in safety records etc,. for that class of vehicle. It gets good gas mileage, and is very comfortable to ride around in rush hour traffic. I am in my car a lot and these things were quite important. I didn't really think of my car as much more than comfortable transportation.

However, after the first 2 weeks of purchasing the car, and riding around town, I realized there was a whole other component to the Saturn transportation. I was pulling out of Kmart or something, and sitting at a light, and I look over at a woman next to me, in the same model and color Saturn as mine. She was gesturing wildly at me, and at first I was afraid. I mean, most people would be in a big city. But I quickly realized she was gesturing for me to roll down my window. So, I did, figuring that the light would change soon, and I could drive away fast...She surprised me by saying &quot;I like your Saturn.&quot; Well, I suppose she did, her's was exactly the same as mine. 

To make a long Epinion short, I have been experiencing the same sort of ebullience from other Saturn drivers, wherever I go. I have adopted the same friendliness, and would encourage others to do the same. I mean, in most big cities, noone really talks to one another, and it makes it so much more pleasant when you have a pleasurable commonality to share. So if you see me gesturing madly to you in your Saturn, don't be nervous, I am just being friendly :)<br><br>
