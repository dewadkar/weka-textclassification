            I first saw the Lexus SC 430 at a local dealer. I was intrigued by its body style, it looked like no other car out there. I was blown away when I asked to take it for a test drive and then found out that it was also a hard top convertible! I had no idea.

I went on the test drive and was immediately impressed with how solid and quiet the car drove with the top up. I had a BMW 740 iL before this and the SC 430 was just as quiet as the 740 on the highway at around 80 mph. 

The handling is very good. This car rides corners well, and you never feel out of control. The engine is very powerful and its much quicker than the 7 series was. Yet, this is not a light car. It weighs almost 4,000 pounds, yet does 0-60 in 5.9 seconds! Even more amazing is that this is one of the few cars on the market that is an ULEV (Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle). So you get all the power you want, and can still feel good about the environment. 

I liked the car so much on the test drive that I went out and bought one. I really enjoy being able to push a button and get the top down or up in about 20 seconds. It really is like having two different cars. The leg room and head room are excellent. I am over 6 feet tall and I fit very comfortably into this car with almost 2 inches of head room left over! 

The only negative I have found so far is that there really is absolutely no trunk space. Lexus claims you can fit a golf bag in the trunk, but don't believe it (unless its a very small bag). I have a walking bag and I still can't get it to fit in the trunk.

The run flat tires are an absolute necessity, as that frees you up from having to have a spare in the trunk taking up the last of the room available. 

I also highly recommend getting the navigation system. It is the best system I have ever had. It blows the 7 series system away in a couple of areas: 1) its DVD based instead of CD, so it has the whole US on one disk. It also has a lot more info on points of interest like restaurants and golf courses, including phone numbers which is very helpful. 2) It recalculates very fast, so that if you miss a turn, within 5 seconds it has a new route for you, and 3) the touch screen aspect is fantastic, and 4) being able to tilt the display option is really nice on sunny days. The two negatives I have on it are that 1) it doesn't seem to have movie theaters in its points of interest and 2) it doesn't let you enter a destination while you are moving. Lexus claims this is for safety reasons, but its a real pain if you are on the highway and someone calls you to meet them someplace you aren't familiar with.

This car is just an amazing value for the money. You really get two cars in one: a refined, quiet, solid luxury sedan with the top up, and road rocket convertible that turns heads with the top down.
