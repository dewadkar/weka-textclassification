            My husband and I purchased this 1993 Dodge Caravan as a family car.
It was to be used to transport the children to and from various sport
events they are involved in.  Large enough for their friends to join
us during fun outings.

Unfortunately, we were in a hurry, I needed a car immediately to    
get back and forth to work and get the kids where they had to go.  We
felt pretty safe with a 1993, as far as it needing any major repairs before the car loan was paid off.  If, only we had a crystal ball, we
would have never invested our hard earned dollars into this caravan.

The transmission went at 92,000 miles, we had purchased it at approximately 55,000.  We had no recourse but to take out a personal 
loan to cover the $1,932.00 expense.

The air conditioning never worked - could not afford to fix it.

The paint is peeling on the roof.

As far as a well known Corporation such a Chrysler in our eyes they
are a big disappointment.  They double talk their recalls for the
ABS system, always stating the recall does not pertain to your problem  

The vehicle does have pep on the road, accelerates quickly, when it's
with you and not at the mechanics or the Dealership.

I don't suggest any middle class families purchasing this vehicle as it
is too costly, $8,000.00 loan, plus rear brake repair of
$234.00 for a car the dealership states is not safe to drive.
If I could afford to replace the entire ABS System which is contaminated, it would cost me approximately $3,600.00 as quoted by dealership.   <br><br>
