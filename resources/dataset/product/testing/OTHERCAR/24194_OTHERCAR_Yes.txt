            I have always wanted a digital camera, but did not want to spend a ton of money for good quality and basic options.  I purchased the DSC-S30 at a local HH Gregg and was taking pictures (with AC Adapter) within 15 minutes of taking it our of the box.

I found that it was easy to use and the basic features were all very easy to find and use.  The quality of picture was extremely good too.

I used it the next day at a friends wedding and again the day after for Easter, and I was surprised at how easy it was to get great pictures.

That weekend I snapped about 150 pictures in the 640x480 resolution.  Almost all of them came out great, and with the quick and easy preview feature, I was able to delete any pictures that did not look nice.

During this time, I filled a 4 meg stick and most of an 8 meg stick.  At this resolution, you really do get a lot of pictures.  

I found this camera compact but very versatile.  Even though it has a flash, I would recommend making sure you have sufficient lighting to get the best quality.  But overall, I was very happy with it, and after seeing the many accessories you can get for it, it is really a great buy.

I also recommend getting the starter kit, which includes the 8 meg stick, a case and a second battery.  During this weekend, I did not even go through a single battery, so they do last for quite some time.  The starter kit only costs $99.

At the higher resolutions, you will most likely need a 32 or 64 meg stick in order to get plenty of snapshots.

Also, it was extremely easy to upload the pictures to my computer using the included USB cable.  I did have to download a windows 2000 usb driver from sony's website (it was not included on the CD), but that was painless and worked flawlessly.
