            If you don't read another opinion about the Millenia - READ THIS ONE!  This opinion is from an owner of a 1995 Mazda Millenia who recently test drove the new one.

I didn't think that they could improve upon this vehicle without jacking up the price.  My 1995 Millenia has over 100,000 miles on it and has NEVER let me down.  The NEW Millenia is as sleek as ever with all the amenities one could ask for.  This car could easily compete with the likes of BMW, Mercedes and Lexus... at 1000's of dollars cheaper.

The plush interior and smooth ride is enough to make most people believers.  But for the speed freaks, the Millenia S with the Miller Cycle engine will snap your head to back of your seat as you stomp on gas.  So there's something for everybody with this vehicle.

My advice is to rush out and AT LEAST test drive this machine if you're thinking about buying a luxury car.  It provides more BANG for your buck than many others in it's class.  If I don't talk myself into upgrading to a new model soon, chances are I'll drive my Millenia for another 100,000 miles!
