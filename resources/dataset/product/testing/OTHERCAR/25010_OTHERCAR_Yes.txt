Looking for a quick and stylish way to go over the river and through the woods?  Check out the Turbo New Beetle. By now everyone is certainly familiar with the re-invented yet ultra lovable VW New Beetle.  The shape of the NEW VW bug clearly harkens back to the days when the old Beetle (although never officially called �Beetle�) was an automotive oddity. Even so, today�s New Beetle is more popular than ever � the New Beetle is odd in a cool way, unlike the past when it was just odd in an odd way. Those that �get it� have one, those that don�t, don�t. VW Beetle�s of yesteryear had to make do with anemic air-cooled engines that were lucky to wheeze out 75 horsepower. The New Beetle delivers a slightly better 115 hp, but that�s not much by today�s standards, cars like the Kia Spectra are equipped with 127 hp engines and the previous Honda Civic Si cranked out an impressive 160 hp. In an effort  to remedy the low horsepower problem, Volkswagen has decided to put the super smooth and peppy 1.8 liter turbo engine from the GTI into the New Beetle. Volkswagen lovingly refers to this engine in its ads as a new addition to the periodic table in the form of  �Turbonium.�   Whatever you call it, no one can argue with the results.

On the road the turbo New Beetle feels much more powerful than the 150 hp figure might suggest.  This car is just plain fun to drive. A 5-speed manual  is the only way to truly enjoy the1.8T engine. The clutch is a nice balance between light and firm, and it engages in a smooth, linear fashion. There is a bit of turbo lag, and it�s especially noticeable when starting from a full stop. Once the turbo kicks in at just over 2000 rpm, the power comes on almost all at once with a quiet whoosh, and that power just keeps on coming.  With the turbocharger engaged, the little engine pulls hard in all gears, and shows no signs of running out of breath � it has all the raw power of a true performance coupe. Once into 5th gear, the power and torque of the turbo are still obvious, but somewhat muted. Sure 150 hp doesn�t sound like a lot, but I happened to be driving the Turbo New Beetle the same week of a press event in Los Angeles. The nature of the event is not important, what is worth mentioning is the fact that I drove about 20 high performance and high dollars cars over a two day period and I was still impressed with the Beetle�s power, refinement, and fun. It�s easy to be disappointed when driving a $20,000 right after driving a $45,000 performance car all out on a race track � not so with the Turbo Beetle. 

As with many smaller cars, the New Beetle has its share of road noise for the driver to contend with.  However, in all fairness the cabin is very quiet at all but highway speeds.

Handling is sporty and controlled, and the ride is a bit firm as a result. As an added value, all 2002 Turbo Beetles come with 16 inch wheels. Perhaps because of the tall roofline on the Beetle, the handling seems to have a bit of a twitchy feeling to it at higher speeds. Although never seeming unstable, the slight �dancing� feel does discourage spirited driving in windy conditions.  For added stability, the turbo version of the New Beetle has a small spoiler mounted at the rear of the roof which automatically raises at a certain speed.  

Inside the new Beetle is an enjoyable place to spend time, it�s obvious that the same attention to detail went into the interior as the exterior.  Too often a new car will look very edgy and bold on the outside, yet inside in might just as well be �97 Toyota Camry. In short the dash and interior bits of the New Beetle appear to be intentionally styled (the Audi TT is another example of interior style matching exterior style). The large, round speedometer is similar to the original VW Beetle in concept, the fuel gauge and tachometer are also housed in this same large area - it all looks very simple and stylish at the same time.  Seats are firm but still comfortable, and are in keeping with the sporty image of the turbo. First impressions are that the front seats are far too firm, but after a few days of driving time, one realizes that comfortable doesn�t always mean cushy.  Rear seat room is less than desirable, and not many adults will be able to fit with much comfort.  Since the New Beetle�s engine is up front, like a normal car, the rear is used as a hatchback type storage area.  There is not a lot of room, but certainly much more than what you�ll find in the trunk of an average compact.  Worth special mention is VW�s very clever sunroof switch.  It is in the shape of a dial, and the driver need only �dial in� how much he or she wants the sunroof to open. This feature is especially useful when wanting to change from the popped up vented position, to the full sun-in-your-face open position.  One simple twist of a roof mounted dial, and everything happens automatically. At just over $21,000 the turbo New Beetle offers a good deal of performance and comfort for the price. However, one would expect at least a single CD player at this price, the New Beetle offers only an AM/FM/cassette as standard equipment.

Overall, the New Beetle turbo is a surprisingly fun and fast car.  Early New Beetle�s seemed to have been plagued
with reliability problems, but he 1.8T version leaves owners with little to complain about.  The turbocharged version of the New Beetle offers stand-out styling, nostalgia, and German sports coupe performance with everyday practicality, at a moderate price.  Believe it or not, this is a  serious performance car, if you can live without a huge back seat, you won�t be disappointed by the New Beetle 1.8T � by the way, it looks really cool in dark blue.
