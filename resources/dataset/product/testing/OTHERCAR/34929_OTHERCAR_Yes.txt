            Yep, that's my car!
I love my '90 Acclaim, mainly because it's easier to handle than my truck.
I've had 2 Acclaims, and they all seem to have the same old problems. Slight fuel leak, squealing belts, etc. But, if there's one thing I know about these cars, it's that they'll run forever! I keep the oil changed and it now has new belts and just keeps going....
At 10 years old, my biggest complaint is that it has to warm up for awhile or it sputters at lights and stop signs until it gets warm. It has no power until then, but that's to be expected.
If you're looking for a dependable grocery getter, this car is it. There's plenty to be said for roominess too. It's not a huge car, but there's plenty of leg room on the inside. The trunk's rather large too. <br><br>
