            My wife bought her 1993 Chevrolet Cavalier in 1995, a year before we wed.  Since then it has been the main family car for us.  It's not a bad car, but I think people can do better for their money.

First, let me start with what's good about this car.  The air conditioning still works to this day (around 160,000 km's) without even so much as a recharge.  That must be some kind of a record.  The ride is very quiet for a small car.  The stereo sounds quite good.  The power is adequate for a car of this size.

Now for what's wrong.  Unfortunately, this list is longer.  My biggest beef is with rust problems.  Along the bottom of the door frame it is rusting out.  I've been trying to keep on top of it, but it's difficult.  I've never had this problem with any other car I've owned.  This looks like a common problem as I've seen Cavaliers around the same year as mine completely rotted out along the bottom of the door frame (not the door itself).  Another annoying problem is the rear window defroster and it's relationship with the power door locks.  If you leave the rear window defroster on, the power door locks sometimes will not work.

This car has cost us enough with repairs as well.  Early on, the head gasket blew (around 80,000 km's).  We discovered this when the distributorless igntions system failed.  When we took it in, the distributorless ignition system module was replaced under warranty, and the head gasket was also replaced because they had to pull the head to replace the module.  The second time around, at 160,000, we were not so lucky.  For around $1,200, we had the head gasket replaced.  $180 for that price is for the belt tensoner which was also failing.  We were not impressed.

Other things that went wrong and shouldn't have were the catalytic converter, alternator, brake rotors worn prematurely, heater core, water pump, and as I mentioned two head gaskets and a belt tensoner.  This is all before 160,000 km's.  I can't figure out the belt tensoner; every other car I've seen uses a bolt and a slider bracket on the alternator.  All these repairs were on top of regular maintenance, which include regular oil changes, regular brake work, transmission fluid replaced, coolant flushed and filled, and the other regular stuff (bulbs, tires, etc).

In summary I have to say that this hasn't been a terrible car.  It's just that there are better cars out there for this price.  If you're buying a new car, the Cavalier just isn't worth it when compared to the competition.  If you're buying used, this car can be a good value if you get it pretty cheap.  I give it a 3 out of 5 because I'd say it's average; not too terrible, but not that great.<br><br>
