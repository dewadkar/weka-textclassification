            I can't say enough good things about the Toyota Corolla! I have two of them a 1985 and a 1997. Both are reliable, maintanance free, and a pleasure to drive!
Believe it or not my 85 Corolla has nearly 300,000 miles on it!!!!! it still drives like the day I got it and it has berally cost me a dime in repairs.
Of course I love my 97 as well. It is a CE model 4 door. I can tell you this about the durablility of this vehicle...I got into an accident last spring on a 55 mile an hour highway...Details the truck ahead of me had a wheel come off..and slam into my drivers side door. Of course I had to slam on the brakes and I did suffer a little whiplash no fault of my car..but the amazing thing is I was told by the police I was VERY lucky I was not seriously injured! My car had to have the door replaced of course but other than that it was perfect..Thanks to my little durable Corolla..I was protected! I can tell you I would not have wanted to be in that same accident in any other car!!! I highly recommend this car to anyone...We have taken numerous long trips in this car...and it gets great gas mileage and is a very comfortable car to travel in. Like I said I can't say enough good things about both my Corollas! and by the way I SWEAR I DON'T WORK FOR TOYOTA!! LOL...I really mean it!!!!<br><br>
