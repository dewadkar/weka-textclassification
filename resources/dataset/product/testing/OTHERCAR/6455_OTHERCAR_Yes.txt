            Our '95 Toyota Camry is definitely a best buy type of thing. We bought it 6 yrs ago as a previous lease vehicle. It had all the bells and whistles on it like power everything, rosewood dash etc. BTW, that is a great way to buy a vehicle - you don't pay all the depreciation. Paid 18k-sticker in car was for 28k.
We have NEVER had a problem with it. Not even once. That is par for the course with Toyota products. We also own an ancient '91 Toyota Pickup (now called a Tacoma) with the extra cab. It has over 141K on it and though we thought we bought it just to haul antiques from auctions my hubby now is determined to use it everyday back and forth to work. His plan is to run it into the ground- he figures he has already gotten his money's worth many times over. Both of the vehicles we own from Toyota have run like a dream!!! 
The sedan is a wonderful family car- great pickup, large trunk space, and ample room for a family of four who travels. With our new addition coming have moved up to a van since any sedan would be difficult to squeeze in 2 car seats and a 13yr old in the back seat. No fault of Toyota's.
