            Personal Experiences

In the almost 3 year period that I have had this car, I have driven to Whistler, Kelowna, Kamloops, Seattle and throughout the U.S. countless amounts of time.  I have taken trips throughout Alberta, Canada  (rocky, icy, mountainous terrain) and it has NEVER failed me.  I count this car as being incredibly reliable.

Definitely Lived Up To My Expectations 

I recommend this car, newer or older to anyone who can live with a 4 cylinder engine (a little over 100hp).  This car is still whippy, handles wonderfully on the road in wet, icy or dry conditions and is cheap to run.
I currently only drive my car to and from work since moving, and gas generally only costs me $30CDN every two weeks.  

Why Did I Buy?

I bought this car for a number of different reasons.

1.	Honda has a great Japanese to back up it&#146s warranty and manufacturing
2.	The price is reasonably in-expensive.  Honda has a great buy-back program available (somewhat like a Lease/Finance deal &#150 except fewer limitations) which allows the owner to pay a reasonable amount of money per month to essentially own the car.
3.	Spacious &#150 great to drive friends/family around in.  Trunk has a tonne of room to take camping supplies etc.
4.	Comfortable
5.	Handles well
6.	Great if I decide to have a family any time soon
