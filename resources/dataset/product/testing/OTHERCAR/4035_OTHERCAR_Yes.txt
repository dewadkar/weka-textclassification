            In January 2000 I finally got my husband to buy me my dream truck!  A brand new Chevy Tahoe - fully loaded.  I bought the 2000 crossover model -Z71 package with 2 tone leather and 4 wheel drive.

This truck has been the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned.  It drives great.  I had a 97 Ford Expedition that I traded in to get this truck and boy was it worth it.  The Expedition had a very rough ride while my Tahoe drives more like a car.  I love the fact that it feels as though it sits wider than the Expedition which makes it feel safer turning corners.  

The gas mileage is okay, not great, but typical for a truck of this size and power.  I got a wonderful deal on my Tahoe at Henna Chevrolet in Austin, Texas and would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a new SUV.  The only thing that I did not like about this truck was the Chevy wheels. (Several people have told me they like them, however I think they are plain and simple)  I did purchase after market wheels for my Tahoe and I looks like the beauty that it is! 

My Tahoe is a dream to drive and I will buy a new one when my lease it up on this one, that's for sure!<br><br>
