            It is the most dependable car I've ever owned. Besides the fact that the brakes need to be replaced twice a year, I have had no problems with it.
I bought it in early 2000, with 36,000 miles. 6 months later, I've put on over 20,000 miles. It has never left me walking. I drive this car very rough, and it has stood up to that. Chevrolet should be proud of this car.
The 3.1 engine offers plenty of punch for a midsize sedan.

However, the seats are uncomfortable. They offer no support. Haul around a corner, and it feels like you're gonna go sliding across the car. The car had been hit bad on the rear passenger side before I bought it, so its got more than its share of squeaks and rattles.
And one minor annoyance... the A/C controls are mounted too far away from the driver to be reached comfortably while driving. And when the A/C is switched off, hot or cold air (depending on what its set on) still comes into the cabin.

I would recommend this car to anyone. The styling is sleek. Its reliable. Got plenty of power and room. Overall its a great car. I'd hate to loose it.<br><br>
