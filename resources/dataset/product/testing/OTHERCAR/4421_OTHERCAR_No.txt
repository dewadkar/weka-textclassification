            I've owned my Golf GLS for about eight months now so I can objectively assess it's pros and cons. My Golf came generously equipped with the usual; A/C, P/W, Cruise, CD, moon roof and a funky shifting auto transmission. 
I found the Golf to be an attractive car and very functional for my needs. I have two very large dogs that fit nicely into the back with the seats down. This is quite surprising by looking at the Golf, as it looks miniscule compared to the 3 ton behemoth SUV's and pickups that dominate the roadway. However it will comfortably transport 5 adults, or two adults and a couple of large dogs. 
The interior is nicely appointed and the seats are quite supportive. Everything is easily reached from the driver's position and visibility is excellent. 
The car performs nicely for a small 4 cylinder engine and I have no trouble passing when the need arises. However the transmission is very glitchy. I park my car on a slight incline and when I turn the  car around, it takes the transmission a few seconds to engage the car when I shift into drive. It's some kind of safety design, but I physically have to put one foot on the brake until it engages or the car rolls backward down my driveway. Some safety design huh? I thought something was wrong with it until I read the owner's manual. 
I have had two repair issues with the car since I have owned, one being the gas door cable came unhinged and the second is my nonfunctioning A/C. I called the dealer initially on the fuel door and explained the problem, took a half day vacation to bring the car in (I live about 60 miles away) and waited for 2 hours for them to tell me that "Yep, the fuel door isn't working properly and we will have to order some parts and you will have to bring it back again." Needless to say I wasn't happy and frankly they didn't give a hoot. 
In the meantime, I found that the A/C blows warm air so I'll be taking it back tomorrow and have them fix (HOPEFULLY) both problems at the same time. 
I still like the car and would consider another VW, but not the same dealer. I am however, disappointed that the vaunted German engineering doesn't exempt the car from quality issues like I expected it to. 

UPDATE: Since the writing of the original opinion I have encountered another service issue with car. The auto transmission when cold lurches hard when shifting into second gear. I thought maybe this was a temporary problem from driving during a torrential downpour, but this has persisted for some two weeks now and it looks like I may have to make another trip to their lousy service department. I am now changing the recommendation from a yes to no. Avoid this car. I've owned a ton of new cars over the past 25 years and never have encountered the problems like this one has.
