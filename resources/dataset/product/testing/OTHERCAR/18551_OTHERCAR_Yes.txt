            When looking for an automobile back in 1996, there were certain items that had to take priority for us to make a purchase decision. We wanted a new car but the prices were prohibitive for the comfort that we also required. We decided that a newer used car would be suitable providing it didn't have many miles and it had been taken care of. We drove the 1993 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and I was impressed. It was quiet and had terrific pickup speed. It had cruise control and power windows...nice comfortable car. I took a job a couple of years ago in which I had to do a lot of interstate driving - I racked up the miles in no time. She just turned 130,000 miles and we are going to keep this car one more year and our next purchase will surely be an Oldsmobile!<br><br>
