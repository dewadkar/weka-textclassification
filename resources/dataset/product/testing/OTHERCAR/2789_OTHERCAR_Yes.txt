            My Olympus Camedia D-340R, 1.3 megapixel camera was a gift, and I couldn't be more pleased with it.  This is my first venture into the digital camera world, and when I opened the box, I had not the slightest idea how to use it.  I am now, 2 months later, quite proficient with even the lesser used features, and I was using the camera on a basic point and shoot level the same day I got it.

The camera comes with a SmartMedia memory card (3.3 v), a battery recharger ( a must, this thing EATS batteries), a strap, software to download pics to your computer, cables to hook it up, and Adobe PhotoshopDeluxe.  There is an optional AC adapter, which I didn't get, but I do recommend.  

The camera takes pictures in 4 different modes; SQ (640x480 res., standard compression), HQ (1280x960 res., standard compression), SHQ (1280x960, minimal compression), and non-compression SHQ(1280x960).  The higher quality settings will take up more space, and you will get less pictures on a card at these settings.  I normally use SQ and have been quite pleased with the picture quality.  I can get  more than 100 pictures on a card at this setting.

The camera has lots of nifty features.  It has a self timer with a 12 second delay, great for getting the photographer in the picture.  It has a sequence mode that will take a maximum of 6-10 pictures at approximately 2 frames per second.  This is terrific to use taking pictures at sporting events.  There is a macro mode for extreme closeups (4&quot; to 20&quot;) of smaller stuff.  There's a panorama mode, which I haven't tried yet, but it only works with their standard SmartMedia cards, not the other brands.  

The LCD screen on the back can be used for viewing your pictures, so there's no wait to see if it came out right.  Additionally, you can use this screen as a viewfinder while taking pictures to be sure you've got just the shot you want, or to set up a timer shot you want to get in.  This uses lots of battery power, but it's a helpful tool.  You can erase individual pictures or the whole card, or you can protect them so they can't be accidentally erased.  You can hook the camera up to view pictures on your TV, or you can print pictures directly from your camera.  You can set up a slide show to view all your pictures with out having to keep hitting the next button.  Personally, I download my shots and edit them on my pc.  

The software for downloading your pictures is easy to use - a big plus for the computer illiterates in your family.  The manual that came with the camera explains things simply and clearly, you should have no problems getting this up and running.

I only have two complaints on this camera.  First, there's no zoom lens.  I want a zoom lens. They do have Digital TeleMode, which makes the subject photographed twice as large by cropping, but to me it's just not the same. Second, if you use the viewfinder to take pictures, you'll notice that the actual picture you get adds a good bit more background than you saw when you lined up the shot.  This is easily fixed by cropping out the extra when you download, but still, it's annoying.

That said, I highly recommend this camera as being easy to use, high quality equipment for those starting out in digital photography.  It's also not bad on price, we got ours for $288.<br><br>
