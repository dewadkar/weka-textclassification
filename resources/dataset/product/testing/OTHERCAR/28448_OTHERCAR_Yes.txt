            My son just rolled our new 2000 Avalon and we're crushed, as was our car!  It was totaled!  But I'm going back to the dealer and will seriously negotiate for another Avalon.  We only owned our car for two months, trading in a Mercedes Benz 1995 E320.  (The MB's ride was steadier and gas mileage better.)
We love the Avalon ride.  Steering is steady and straight.  Comfort is astounding, CD sounds great.  It has the most comfortable back seat I've ever sat in, much better than our MB, much more leg room and back support.  We like the the display panel and compass, would've considered a navigation package.  This is our 5th Toyota and, as with all the others, we drove it off the lot and never returned for ANY adjustments or repairs.  Toyota cars are remarkably built and reliable.
Our only criticism is gas mileage.  We only got about 20-21 MPG, considerably less than our MB (24 MPG).  But we'll gladly sacrifice a few bucks for the improved comfort, cheaper repairs and service, and reliability.<br><br>
