            I have been using old fashion cameras for a long time now. It was during summer 2000 when I spend a month in Japan that I decided to go for a digital camera.

First, I wanted something light that takes good quality pictures because I was doing my website during the trip. Being a student, I couldn't afford something expensive though.

After spending days and days, I could narrow down my choices to three-four products. I finally decided to get the Sony DSC-S50 because it wasn't too expensive and also because I have always been happy with Sony products!

How glad I was to be right! The Sony DSC-S50 was more than a good choice! It was a revelation! Not only the quality of the photos were beautiful, but also the interface was very easy and quick to learn. In short words, I didn't have to use the manual to understand how to use it!!!

Yes, the Sony DSC-S50 doesn't look as &quot;sexy&quot; as other brand BUT, the quality is here indeed! Moreover, the fact that it uses Sony's memory sticks allows you have the same memory technology if you have a Vaio computer or a Sony mp3 player!!!

Finally, I was impressed to see that not only you can take beautiful pictures, but you could also take short movies!!!!

But, enough BLABLABLA... check for yourself because I have used the Sony DSC-S50 for my website dedicated to my trip to Japan... Check it so that you can really see with your eyes!!!!!!<br><br>
