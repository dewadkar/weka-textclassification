            I have had my Buick Century Custom for almost a year and I just love it!  This car is smooth riding, has lots of room and with dual airbags, anti-lock brakes and child safety locks it is a safe family car.  The get up and go is terrific.  I don't have to sit an an intersection waiting for &quot;no cars in sight&quot;, if a have even a little clearance I can get out and catch up to the speed of traffic quickly.  No more honking because you pulled out in front of someone and they had to slow down for you.  In a busy city, this is a great advantage.  The safety features work well with my 5 year old.  The doors are automatically locked when I take it out of park and he can't unlock them until it goes back into park.  (No more worrying about those open door incidents.)  And for those of you with kids around that age, the doors aren't too heavy for a small child to open and close on their own.  My son loves the independence this allows him, he can get in and out on his own.  I would recommend this car to anyone on a modest budget for a car, who prefers mid-size vehicles, especially for families.  Some bonuses about this car are the great gas mileage and the oil change light, great for busy people like me who forget how long its been since the oil was changed!  <br><br>
