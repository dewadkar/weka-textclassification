            I never really looked at a Volvo,but I saw this one and it was pretty cheap,and I am glad I went with this.I simply love this car!For it's weight,and the small engine she's got alot of power.The Engine purrs like a kitten,rockets up to 40 MPH,and hugs curves like a Ferrari(I've driven a ferrari,I'm serious).
The sound system is great(I only have the factory speakers,I have a kenwood deck)The interior is well designed,roomy,comfortable,and functional(I love the little shelf thingy above the climate control),I don't know how the A/C works,mine needs a recharge.The heater will drive you out of the car in a matter of minutes.
The trunk is HUGE!for a car it's size and has a nice little raised area for boxes,storage or other things.The spare tire is kept rear,left in a trunk hold,and is covered with a carpeted cover,with the jack in the pocket on the side.The Tranny shifts smoothly(both Auto,and stick)No slippage what so ever.
the brakes are quick and respnsive like a Mercedes Benz.The seat heaters were a surprise for me and they work great!
Matinence is a snap also,contrary to popular belief,I had no problems finding parts and the engine access was incredible.

I really would buy another car from Volvo,I think that they make their cars better than most and at a fair price.I really would recommend this for a first time driver,for the light insurance load and the safety and reliability that most others cannot replicate.
