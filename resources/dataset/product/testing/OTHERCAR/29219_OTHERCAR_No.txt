            I was fortunate that I didn't buy this over priced tank; it was only a rental.  I am sure the handling of this vehicle would improve with more experience behind the wheel.  However it was the most uncomfortable I had ever driven or rode in.  My passengers complained that the ride wasn't what they expected in a luxury car.  As a matter of fact after driving it for over 200 hundred miles I was in pain from the ill fitting seats, that were very hard.  As for the toys that are available in it, who cares whether your going north or south.  It doesn't even provide enough leg room for taller people ...  as for the price tag; I really expected more from this car  ...  surround sound, dual temperate control, a smoother ride ( you could feel all the bumps in this car.)  I have driven quite a few rentals with a lower price tag that had better options and a more comfortable ride with great gas mileage, this just would not be my choice of cars.<br><br>
