            Let me start by saying we bought this truck for my husband to go Hunting, Fishing, etc in.  We needed another vehicle, so we decided to get one that would be sufficient for his hobbies also.

This <b>1992 Toyota 4x4</b> has been the best truck.  It is a simple truck.  It has three seatbelts, but a bench seat.  The rear sliding window, its a 5 speed with 4 wheel drive, 4 cylinder, Nothing electrical like automatic windows or any of that.  I am sure it comes that way, but we bought this used.  We have 31 inch Mud Terrain Tires on it and 10 1/2 inch rims.

We bought it with 80,000 miles on it and nothing was wrong with it. It has over 104,000 miles now, and is still ticking.  We had to replace the starter after 102,000 miles.  Naturally, we have to do the regular routine maintenance on it such as oil changes.   But other than that we haven't had any trouble with it.

The only really bad thing about this truck is the gas mileage.  It gets about 17 miles to the gallon.  My husband uses it to drive back and forth to work as well, and he has to fill up once a week.  

This truck is built for 4x4 driving!  What do I mean by that?  Well, its a <b>tough</b> truck!  We have taken it through water that was up to the bottom of the doors.  It went through it like a dream.  Well, your not impressed yet, huh?  We took it through a creek, mud over the wheels and we have never gotten stuck.  I think that it has a little to do with the driver. &lt;grin&gt;

For those of you that are considering a truck for sporting use.  This would be the one.  Its built like a big boy!!
