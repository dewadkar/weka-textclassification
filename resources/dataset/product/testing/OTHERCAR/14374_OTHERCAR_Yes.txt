            I fell in love with the cadillac deville a few years ago. My daughter was looking for a new luxury car and by chance we stopped at a cadillac dealer. He invited me to sit in a deville and i just fell instantly in love. I knew this was my dream car. The seats felt like you were sitting on a cloud. The interior of the car makes you feel as though you are wrapped in a warm safe blanket. A few weeks ago I was treated to a ride in a Deville and I came to the conclusion that I will own one of these cars in the near future. I love the way your speed is illuminated in big numbers so that you don't have to guess at your speed. The  heated seats are wonderful so that you can be comfortable and not interfere with anyone eles's comfort. This is the car of my dreams.
