            When I hear the words "German Efficiency" I think of three letters B! M! W!. I purchased a 2000 Red 323i BMW and ohhhh do I love driving it.  This car hugs the road like a Russian Bear.  I have never slid or spun out and that really show the effort that BMW puts into a fine automobile. The car accelerates like none other and the steptronic allows you to dextrously get around any bad situation on the road.  The car has 6 airbags and I feel safer inside the car than outside.  The buttons on the steering wheel alow easy access to Cruise control and the Radio making it extra safe.  The sound system is excellent, it has 2 10' subs for when you want to bump it and 10 interior speakers allow for maximum sound quality when you want to relax to Borodin's 2nd Symphony. You can feel the texture of the road because of the Sport suspention.  The Sport seats absorbs any bumps along the way and you can adjust it to any angle.  The A/C can immediately respond to temperature changes and the defroster can take care of any misty patch on the windows.  The back seat can fit people more comfortably than in other cars of its class and they have the safety of knowing its a BMW.  Overall my only gripe is the fuel economy, I can go about 250 miles per tank with automatic, and about 300 miles per tank with manual.  Overall, everyday I wake up with the pleasure of knowing that I get to drive my car.
