            I was happy with my Dodge but dreamed about the Honda and just never thought I could afford it.  My husband and I decided to start leasing our vehicles and that allowed us into the Honda world though the retail price is reasonable for the quality.  Major key in this lease deal.  The leasing company we usually work with could not get a good profit from this vehicle because the demand was too great so it turned out better and cheaper to lease from the dealers company.

The 2001 model comes in 2 packages, EX and LX.  They make it very simple, few options, if any.  Some may not like this but the standard features are all you would ever need, they just don't need options.  Gas mileage is 18/25 per their quotes but I have seen consistent low 20's and close to 30 on long highway trips.  Please see specifications at the Honda website: http://www.honda2001.com/models/odyssey/features.html

A list of things I love:
 - Honda quality
 - Drives so smoothly
 - Safety features (dual airbags, steel beam doors, 3 point harness seat belts even for middle person in back bench seat has a shoulder belt nestled in the roof)
 - Seat options are incredible - 2 captains in front, 2 captains in middle (1 can slide and connect to the other to form a smaller bench) and long bench in the rear which can fold up and hide in the deep trunk floor
 - Deep trunk floor - the spare tire is inside the floor in front of the middle seats, completely hidden so the trunk space is deeper than the door opening and makes storage so much easier
 - A lot of room - I consistently get comments about how much room is in this vehicle that looks compact on the outside and these comments are from the back seats!
 - Ease of use of controls, Stereo/CD player, A/C
 - Attractive dash with tons of room
 - Handy table between 2 front seats with cup holders and extending tray to middle seats with cup holders (can fold down easily to allow movement, can store things underneath table)
 - comfortable seating - very adjustable and easy to remove or change arrangement
 - 360 degree turns are extremely tight
 - can turn on and off interior lights with a simple button on dash, nice to have that control if kids are sleeping when we get home


Things I don't like:
 - Driver-side sliding door (in my case) sticks and makes it difficult at times to open (maybe power doors are better for this problem)
 - can't see cruise control button (turns it on and off)- the steering wheel is in the way of the sight of some of the dash controls - this could be better
 - would be nice to have a way to open back hatch with dash control or button
 - wanted a moon roof - they don't come with one

This vehicle is perfect for my family and I feel better knowing the quality is proven and I enjoy the family-friendly and driver-friendly little things that they have included in this mini-van.  I really love it!
