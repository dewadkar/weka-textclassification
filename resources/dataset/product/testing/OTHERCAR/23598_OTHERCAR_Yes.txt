               Ironically the Lexus was my last choice as far as a new car was concerned, I had driven the Camry, Accord and Acura Cl Type S and thought that I would never buy a Lexus.  However my first test drive of the Lexus proved to be decisive and I haven't look back since.
     The Lexus is a truly splendid and ,so much so that I was actually taken aback when another author commented that wind noise was a problem.  In my car at least once when your buckled in it's difficult to tell whether or not the engine is on because the passenger compart is so well sealed.  Ambient noise is hardly noticeable at 85 miles an hour.
      Regarding the interior, yes although it isn't fully appointed with leather it's quite comfortable nonetheless.  The rear passenger compartment offers acceptable dare I say good leg room.  One note worthy drawback to the Lexus however is a lack of headroom, this car is certainly a tightfit for anyone over 6'2 and even requires some modest seat adjustment for anyone over 5'9.
       As far as handling is concerned the Lexus relatively loose and quick steering can turn any drive in moderate traffic into an exciting video game much faster than Quake or Duke Nuke Em.  The car reacts quickly and accurately to driver input and is a godsend to quick drivers trying to work their way through the morning commute.  
       Not only is the car quick and responsive it is also has quite a bit of traction as well and makes quick work of long and winding curves.  In addition the car's excellent balance and stability makes it a very predictable vehicle to drive and it is unlikely to &quot;surprise&quot; the new owner at some inconvenient place such as a chicane or corner while he is driving at moderate or brisk pace.  
        Power delivery is excellent last minute passing decisions can be made and executed with the greatests confidence.  There are few real world instances where I found the IS-300's power to be inadequete or wanting.  In fact I can recall more than one occaision where I applied vigourous throttle while making a close pass and came out without a scratch on dent, much to my amazement.   
        The brakes on the Lexus are absolutely outstanding and the car can come to a quick and rather sudden stop with almost no regard for distance,a wonderful feature for the inattentive driver who often finds himself in traffic.
         However despite all of it's strengths the Lexus does have one rather annoying weakness:it has a monstrous appetite for gasoline.  I seem to be averaging 20 miles a gallon and find myself at the gas station more often than I would like.
         In conclusion I wholeheartedly recommend the Lexus to the motorist who needs a bit of speed and adventure in his driving experience.  The Lexus will take him to wherever his travels lead him with speed and style.                        <br><br>
