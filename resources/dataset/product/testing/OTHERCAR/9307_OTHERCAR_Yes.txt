            WOW!!! I'm in love with this piece of everything and anything. These makers know exactly what they are doing and talking about. &quot;The E55 AMG is Mercedes limited production sport sedan. The E55 features a high output 5.5-liter V8 engine, which generates 349 horsepower with 391-lb/ft of torque to move out of sticky situations. The E55 comes fully equipped with all the luxury features including automatic climate control, power leather seating with memory, and a power sunroof. Adhering to Mercedes' attention to safety, the E55 comes with a plethora of features. Safety features include: Electronic Stability Program (ESP), Automatic Slip Control (ASC), four-wheel anti-lock brakes and side airbags with the head curtain protection system.
