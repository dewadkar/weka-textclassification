            I have to say the Honda Accord is absolutely one of the best cars around. I absolutely love my car.  I bought a 1991 Accord years ago and put tons of miles on it and the car NEVER gave me any trouble whatsoever.

I just recently (3 months ago) traded it in for another Honda Accord and I love it just as much, if not more.  The Accords are very dependable, great on gas mileage, and very comfortable.  The drive is smooth. I KNOW when I am driving this car I will not have to worry about being stranded or anything, as I did years ago before I bought my first one.

They are very attractive cars as well.  The body style is very classy. I will continue to buy Honda Accords for as long as I buy cars. 

The ONLY thing I do not like is that they are mid sized cars and I wish they were just a little bit bigger, but it really is nothing I concern myself with.

If you are looking for a great, dependable, economical car....THIS IS IT!!!!! <br><br>
