            Overview

I originally bought this camera as a "portable" addition to my Nikon SLR camera.  Instead, I have purchased a complete replacement to the much bigger Nikon SLR.  I bought this camera from Amazon.com in 11/2001 for $399 with free shipping and a rebate that included a sling bag, a 16MB CF Card, and an extra battery in addition to the standard camera package.

Of course, the camera takes excellent pictures both indoor and outdoors.  But, the main feature of this camera is it's great SIZE.  This camera is so small that I take it EVERYWHERE!  And I don't look like a nerd doing so, I think that I actually look sort of cool?!  Since upgrading from my SLR, I've been able to capture so much more of my adventures on film.

The camera supports the main features that I was interested in: Black & White photos, Hi Resolution Color photos (2.1MPix is perfectly suitable for 8*10 prints), movies with sound, great software, etc.

CONNECTION TO THE COMPUTER

Before buying digital, I was concerned that the interface between my Canon and the computer would quickly become obsolete.  This, however is not the case.  Any computer, running any version of Windows with USB will be able to support this camera.  If USB becomes obsolete, then you'll merely have to purchase a Compact Flash card reader that connects to the computer via another interface like Firewire.  

SOFTWARE

The software bundled with this camera is pretty good.  Installation was easy.  Downloading photos and movies onto the computer is very, very easy.  Organizing the photos on my computer (keep in mind that you'll soon have hundreds or even thousands of pictures to manage) is easy.  They supply software that will allow you to digitally enhance your photos or movies.  They also supply an interesting piece of software called Photostitch.

I wish that the camera shipped with Adobe Photoshop, but that program alone probably costs $500-700.  

Photostitch software allows you to digitally combine multiple images to form one giant (panoramic, perhaps) image.  I took a series of about 9 beautiful pictures of this coastal town and digitally 'stitched' them together using this software.  The picture looks amazing.  The camera also supports panoramic shots through one of its shooting modes.  When used with Photostitch, the results are fantastic.

MEMORY

The camera ships with a wimpy 8MB CF card.  While this is suitable to get up and running with the camera, I'd recommend immediately buying the most memory that you can afford.  

The camera supports any size Type I Compact Flash card.  I recently bought a 256MB CF card and have had superior results.  I can store approximately 260 of the highest quality images, or literally thousands of lower quality images.

Keep in mind that a top quality 2.1 Mpixel image takes about 1MB worth of memory. If you use a higher Mpixel camera, you'll need more memory.  Luckily, memory prices are dropping FAST, so we'll all soon be able to take as many pictures as we want!

MOVIES

The movies have turned out to be a very, very fun addition to this camera.  Regardless of the size of the CF card, the S110 only allows you to take 5-7second (highest res), 15 sec (medium res) or 30 second (low resolution) movies.  It's really been a blast taking both black and white, and color movies.  Unlike some cameras, the movies DO have sound.  The sound is pretty good.  When viewed on the computer, the movies look great.  When viewed directly on the TV through the supplied video cable the movies look a little choppy, presumably because of their large size.

TV CONNECTION

Saying that, it's been fun hooking the S110 up to the TV.  Just plug the camera into the cable and you can have a slideshow on any TV.  This has been fun as I rent a ski house with a bunch of people.  At the end of the weekends we plug in the camera and run through the pictures.  

BATTERY LIFE

The battery comes with a rapid charger.  Use the battery for about 150-170 shots with the flash and it'll be totally depleted.  Note that these high quality batteries do not need to be fully drained before recharging them.  I got the rebate offer for a free battery - but I only sent in the form about 3 weeks ago so hopefully I'll see another battery soon!  

OTHER NICETIES

The camera will take pictures using a timer.  Press the trigger and wait for about 10 seconds before the picture is taken.  I also bought a nice, very inexpensive ($5) tripod that screws into the tripod holder.  The tripod has three flexible 5" legs.  The legs are flexible, and thus the camera can be mounted anywhere.  When you are done with the tripod simply straighten out the legs, unscrew the tripod, and put the tripod in your pocket.
