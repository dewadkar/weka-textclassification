            I purchased my 1998 Neon in 1999 as a rental return. I was graduating from high school and was planning on attending college, four hours away, in the fall. I didn't care for the idea of being stuck there on weekends and holidays so I decided to fork over all of my hard-earned summer wages as well as graduation money for my very own car.

Because a large chunk of my down payment belonged to my mother and she would be paying my insurance while I was in college, she went with me to the dealership. I had my heart set on a Chevy Cavalier convertible, red, complete with CD player. My mom had her heart set on a nice white Corsica or maybe even a station wagon. We had to compromise.

My shiny red Plymouth Neon Expresso, complete with a ... well, radio, was that compromise. A relative bargain at $8999, I was able to put down a hefty down payment which left me with highly manageable monthly payments. I liked it because it was red, it had a spoiler, and it just looked like what I, as a newly graduated high school senior and soon-to-be college coed, should be driving. My mom liked it because of the excellent gas mileage (24 city, 33 highway, according to the sticker) and the dual airbags. We both left the dealership feeling we had gotten what we wanted.

The car itself is very spacious and laid out well. I made many long drives alone in my Neon and didn't feel cramped. Because the Neon is a lower-priced car, it doesn't have some of the amenities of the more mid-range cars (like cruise control or automatic windows and locks) but it does have a very decent sound system, efficient heating and cooling systems, and a folding-back rear seat for extra trunk space.

It's been just over a year since I brought my Neon home. In that time, I've had only a couple small problems. A few months after I bought it, the &quot;Service Engine Soon&quot; light lit up on the display panel. Having no experience with cars whatsoever, I immediately brought it in to have it looked at. The helpful people at the Amoco down the street from my college told me that it was nothing, just a false alarm, and they turned it off. A few weeks later, while I was home for the weekend, it went off again, and I took it to the local dealership. They determined the problem was a spark plug and fixed it. Since then, the light has stayed off. On another occasion, the engine made some very disturbing choking sounds when I started the car and it wouldn't shift gears. Again, I took it in (better safe than sorry, I say) and they found nothing wrong; it never happened again.

I absolutely love my car. It was in my price range, it was cute, and it's served me well over many a four-hour drive home on the weekend. I'd recommend it for anyone on the market for a safe, attractive economy car. And, if you're seriously considering buying a Neon, check out the Expresso model - it has the cutest spoiler! (Just ask any teenager.) <br><br>
