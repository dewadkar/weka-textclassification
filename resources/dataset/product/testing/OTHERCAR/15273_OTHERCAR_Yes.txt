            It's amazing what comes out of SONY these days. Be it the new Memory Stick technology, or their extensive line of digital cameras. Sure you're saying, what's so special about digital cameras? They can be bought just about anywhere, from many different companies. Sony's Mavica series of cameras are unique, in that they store their photographs on floppy disks. This feature makes them more than worth their price. As a student often involved in many different school groups, clubs, extracurricular activities, I am not always near a computer. It's great to know that I can just carry around a bunch of floppy disks, swapping a full one for an empty one in a few seconds, and fit about 15 pictures on each disk. Even when I am near a computer, though, it is nice to be able to simply pop a disk in and copy the files, as opposed to playing with finicky hardware connections or installing software on every computer at which the camera may be needed. Overall, the Sony line of digital cameras are second to none in quality, speed and reliability. My 'MVC-FD81' is one of my favorite pieces of computer equipment to use, because using it doesn't require one to know a million hardware settings, or think about them on the road. Simply point, look at the bright LCD display and click -- you have captured a still shot or a few seconds of fluid video and sound. I highly reccommend it.<br><br>
