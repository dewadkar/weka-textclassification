            This van is wonderful.  I really didn't want the driver's side sliding door and refused to pay for it as an extra (now it is a standard feature).  But now I can't do without it.  My youngest is in a carseat and I can get him in and out easily.

When I need extra room, the seats come out easily.  I am a petite person of 5'1&quot; but can remove all the back seats by myself, including the back bench seat.  

It  has several cupholders where most of my children can get to their drinks and food easily on long trips.  They could be a little more convenient for the captain's chairs, but this is a small problem.

We make 1000 mile trips all the time to visit my parents, and this van is something that I would not want to be without.  It is comfortable, has getup and go, and drives easily.<br><br>
