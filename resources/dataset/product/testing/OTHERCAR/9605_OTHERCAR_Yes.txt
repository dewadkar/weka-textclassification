            The 2000 Toyota Celica GT is definitely  like nothing I've ever seen before.The styling of the car is amazing.  It looks so aggressive and futuristic.  The engine on the GT puts out 140 hp.  This is enough to get you around town.  The GT won't win many drag races, but it would win many car shows.  The interior is very comfortable.  The seats swallow you whole.  Controls are very easy to find and use.  I had no trouble getting anything to work.  The 5 speed transmission is unbelievable.  It is the best shifter I have ever felt.  The gears change so easily.  The shifter has a very &quot;tight&quot; feel to it.  The car gets incredible gas mileage.  It gets 28 city and 34 highway.  The rear end sits up too high.  I had trouble looking out of the back.  The car I drove was not equipped with spoiler.  I would imagine that a spoiler would make things worse.  I would suggest getting some TRD lowering springs to help with the visibility problem in the back.  The rear seats are very cramped.  I would not want to sit in them for any length of time.  I would also suggest getting the GT-S model.  The extra 40 horses and the 6 speed transmission bring the car to near perfection.<br><br>
