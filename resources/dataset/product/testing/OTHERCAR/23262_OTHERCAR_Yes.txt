            My original review of the Quest was posted for the 2000 model, not the 2001 ( oops ); this will be the correction.

My mom bought a Nissan Quest this year. Why a Quest? She needs something fairly large, and station wagons aren't built much these days, so she was pretty much stuck with buying a minivan.

She has an old station wagon that has too many miles on it and lots of undependability, but she hasn't used the Quest much; the vehicle probably has under 500 miles on it so far. Some people worry about the size of the Quest even though it doesn't 'drive' as large as it looks.

I believe this is the GXE model, base MSRP ( manufacturer's suggested retail price ) about $22,400.

The vehicle looks larger than a mid-size vehicle, but that's because it's a bit higher than a sedan. I've driven it a few times, and it's not as hard to move around as it looks. The Quest is between 16 and 16 1/2 feet long, between 6 and 6 1/2 feet width, between 5 1/2 and 6 feet high, and between 9 and 9 1/2 feet for wheelbase length.

The seats seem plush, but increase static ( minor annoyance ).

<B>Some bits of standard equipment</B>

The Quest has a six cylinder engine with fuel injection, an automatic transmission and cruise control
Estimated gas mileage is 17 city, 24 highway
Brakes are anti-lock type
Fuel tank has a 20 gallon capacity
There are two sliding passenger doors and a tailgate
There's an AM/FM radio ( no tape or CD player with ours ) There is also a keyless entry system ( click a button on the remote, unlock the doors )
The vehicle has powered windows
Steering wheel is tiltable
The vehicle has halogen headlights
Seven passenger seating

The model my mom has isn't filled with that many extras; no extra interior lighting, no video screen for VHS playing.

And now, info from the manual....

<B>Seats, restraints and supplemental air bag systems</B>

The Quest holds seven people. Two bucket seats in the front, a bench seat ( holds two ) OR two separate bucket seats in the second row, a bench seat ( holds three ) in the third row.

The front seats are separate from each other; they can be slid forward or backward, and reclined. Each seat has a headrest that can be moved up/down. These seats have the option of being powered ( not taken on the mom's ). There are also optional storage trays located under the seats.

If the second row has a bench seat, the seat has armrests; the armrests can be flipped up. The seats also have headrests, but they can't be adjusted. It can also be removed.

Bucket seats in the second row can be removed.

If the second row seat(s) is/are removed then the third row seat can moved to that spot.

The rear bench seat can also be slid ( forward/backward ) and reclined.

The second row bench seat and third row seat can be folded ( creating a decent amount of flat space and cupholders ) or put into a storage configuration, creating more storage room.

The seat belts are meant to be used while sitting completely back in a seat.

Children should not be held on your lap; they should have their own seat, secured with a child safety seat or a seat belt. The second row bench seat allows an integral child safety seat.

The driver and front passenger positions each have an air bag ( standard equipment ).

<B>Instruments & controls</B>

The console has the usual controls/buttons: horn, brightness for dials and controls, parking brake, gear shift, hazard warning flasher, vents for fan/air conditioning, cigarette lighter, etc.  There are also items found on many modern autos: cup holders, cruise control, etc.

There are the usual gauges: engine coolant temp, tachometer, speedometer, and fuel.

Warning/indicator lights and chimes are for the turn signal/hazard light, brake warning light, high beam indicator, seat belt reminder ( and chime ), engine oil pressure warning, charge warning, low fuel warning, cruise control on light, overdrive off light, malfunction indicator, air bag warning, and door open light ( optional ).

All the powered windows can be controlled from the driver's position; controls are on the arm of the door.  If the vehicle has powered vent windows ( manual vent windows will be in place if powered ones are not chosen ) the controls will also be at the driver's position.

A sunroof is optional for the Quest.

The driver's side, second, and third row seating positions have a personal reading light located in the overhead trim panel.

A pair of map lights are located within reach of people sitting in the front row.

The Homelink Universal Transceiver system is optional ( we don't have it ).

The manual says there is a cigarette lighter on the instrument panel and an accessory plug to 12v devices; in my model the 'lighter' is marked as the accessory plug, and there is no accessory plug ( or lighter ) at the place on the vehicle ( left side of 2nd row of seats ) where there should be the accessory plug.

<B>Notes on doors</B>

The driver side sliding door can't be opened if the fuel door is open.

Each sliding door has a child safety switch ( the door can be prevented from being opened by handle use ).

The remote has three buttons: a lock button, unlock button, and panic alarm. The lock button locks all doors ( provided they are closed ), the unlock button unlocks the driver's door or all doors ( push button twice ), the panic alarm causes the car's horn to blare repeatedly.

The tailgate ( aka rear door ) is unlocked by turning counterclockwise ( against instincts? ); pull the handle ( hidden above the license plate ) to open the tailgate.

<B>Heating & air conditioning</B>

A manual heater and air conditioner are standard; an automatic one is optional. There is also an optional air conditioner for the rear seat.

Available operations are defrosting/defoging, heating, heating & defrosting/defoging ( simultaneous ), and cooling.

<B>AM/FM radio and other audio</B>

The radio stores up to 6 frequencies of the AM band and 12 of the FM band. The radio can use the Radio Data System; you push a button then the radio seeks a station that has a certain type of programming ( such as talk, country, or rock ).

A cassette player ( built with the radio ) and CD player ( separate from the radio ) are optional.

<B>Driving</B>

The Quest is started by turning the ignition key; the gas pedal should not be depressed when starting the engine.

The Quest has a cruise control system ( standard equipment ); this allows you to travel at a constant speed without having to keep your foot on the gas pedal.

<B>Emergency situations</B>

The Quest has a temporary spare tire ( as current vehicles often have *bah! cheap companies* ); the temporary spare shouldn't be driven fast or for a very long distance.  The tire is stored under the vehicle; you have to turn a nut located on the floor of the vehicle to lower the tire, then reach under the Quest and pull the tire clear. Clumsy, hmmm?

In a serious accident the flow of fuel is automatically stopped by a fuel cutoff valve. You can get the fuel to flow again by turning the key to the on position for a few seconds, turn off, then attempt to start the vehicle.

If a Quest is towed, a "wheel lift" tow truck should be used; if the Quest is towed facing rearwards then dollies should be placed under the front wheels.

<B>Maintenance</B>

Some maintenance can be performed by an owner. Engine coolant, engine ( motor ) oil, transmission fluid, power steering fluid, brake fluid, window washer fluid, spark plugs, windshield wiper blades, fuses and lights ( headlights, interior lights, turn signal lights, etc. ) can be replaced at home; details are in the manual.

<B>Towing</B>

The Quest can tow a trailer; maximum total load is 3500 pounds. If the Quest is a cargo van type, a trailer should NOT be towed.

<B>Interior lighting</B>

The standard interior lighting has a dome light, two lights
in the passenger area ( located at calf level near the side frames ), and a light on the inside of the tailgate.  The lights turn on when a door is opened; when all doors are closed the lights remain on for a few seconds, then fade off.
