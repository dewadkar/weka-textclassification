            We bought our gorgeous blue CR-V three years ago and my wife loves it.  We've had zero problems with it - it is the most reliable car on the road according to Consumer's Report.

As soon as the pictures came out for the CR-V, especially in the blue, my wife wanted one.  I was concerned about the small engine in the first years, so we waited.  When we were ready, Honda upped the horses to 146 and I thought that would be great to address the concerns I'd read about it being underpowered.  I guess it helped to a certain extent, but don't be fooled - this is not a V6.  In fact, the gearing for the CR-V is borderline schizophrenic and quite often the tranny and engine don't sync well (especially on long ascents).

However, it is my wife's car, and still loves it in spite (or because of) it's obvious shortcomings.  I love the utility of the immense cargo area when buying big items.  And the roof rack comes in handy when the items are too big to go inside.

Gas mileage is still a big issue for me as it only averages about 23-25 on long trips and about 20 for mostly city driving.  This is the same engine that gets over 30 in the Civic!  So between the screwy gearing and the un-aerodynamic nature of the body you lose a good deal of efficiency.

The interior fit and finish is excellent and we've experienced no broken knobs or switches at all.  Still my major gripe is about the angle of the steering wheel.  I'm somewhat used to being able to customize the angle of the wheel to best benefit my style.  The CR-V allows none of that: you get either 18-wheel angles or 1979 Ford van angles.  Nothing even remotely approaches a comfortable angle for casual driving.  It forces you to sit straight up and even lean forward to reach the top of the steering wheel (and still remain far back enough to be safe from the exploding airbag).

Overall the car drives well for a high-profile SUV.  It is prone to wind gusts that can knock you sideways, but the steering is responsive and easily corrects for such instances.  When taking corners, you'll quickly learn to use the great brakes to shave off the mphs before you get there - otherwise you can get the uneasy feeling that you just might tip over because of your high center of gravity.  And as you ramp up the mphs again, you'll really notice the anti-radio noise creeping up.  Seems Honda has a problem keeping the wind noise out of these designs as the new CR-V suffers from it even now.

But these are issues for all SUVs, so as long as you're expecting them, it won't be a problem to anticipate and correct for them.
