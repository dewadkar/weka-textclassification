            I have purchased and driven my new CL Type-S for 2 weeks now. I feel like I can write a review about everything that I want to share about this one amazing car.

First of all, it took over 3 weeks and 2 dealerships to get my car delivered. Why? ---&gt; Reason # (1) In the heart of Silicon Valley in California, these has been a major shortage of new cars, especially luxury and sports cars, and CL Type-S is qualified as both luxury and sporty. There are just too many rich people with too much cash to burn here. A lot of them will not be bothered to pay MSRP or even a premium to get the newest and fanciest cars and be amongst the first few owners to own them. It boots up the ego of many dealerships of not feeling the need to discount from MSRP's any more. You buy at my MSRP or get out of my parking lot. Take it or leave it. That's the attitude easily found at many dealerships. In other cases, they just don't have any cars in stock, they are completely sold out. All they can do is put your name on their waiting list. They will search from other dealerships or wait for their next shipment from Acura headquarters. I was put on a wait list to be called. Reason # (2) I ran into one dealership, negotiated the price, with a secret, I got a great discount off MSRP, then made a faithful deposit. Yet the dealership changed the delivery date of my car once, twice, and eventually three times. It turned out they were either incompetent or simply had no good connection with other Acura dealerships to swap cars. I had to call around and talk to other local dealerships to find my favorite CL Type-S. Fortunately, the second dealership found the car within one day and had it physically delivered within 3 days. Great service!

So how has the car been performing?

There are just too many great positive things to talk about the car. &quot;Almost everything&quot; that is advertised and marketed in the car brochure and on Acura's web site (www.acura.com) is TRUE. I encourage you to check out Acura web site to get full product information.

Let me focus on the negative experiences, although just a handful. You should know about these to make sure they won't surprise you if you are going to buy the car:
(1) The car comes with a Bose stereo system. The disppointment is that it has NO BASS. Yes, it has no rich bass. The car has 6 speakers, and it should have 7 including a sub-woofer. Because of its lack of a sub-woofer, it cannot deliver rich bass. It does well in delivering mid-range and high-range sound, but I wish it would be capable of producing deep rich bass. I don't want heart-pounding bass, but I know Lexus and even a Camry does a much better job in stereo sound. One solution for the CL Type-S is to buy an addon subwoofer like Bazooka for about $300. 
(2) The spare tire is NOT a full-size tire. It's a compact tire on a skinny wheel, although it's still unusually bigger than other really tiny spare tires offered by other models. I'm sure the salemen can defend this well, but be warned that if you get a flat tire, you must put on this compact tire and don't go too fast and far with that. With such a large trunk, I can't understand why Acura doesn't offer a full-size spare tire? It just doesn't make sense. 
(3) Not enough color choices for CL Type-S model. You are very limited in selecting your exterior colors if you want to go with a CL Type-S as supposed to a CL. This is another disappointment that makes no sense to me. If you still find a color that you like on a Type-S, congrats and you are really lucky.
(4) The front end is quite boring. I like the rear end a lot. But I can't figure out why the front end is so old-fashioned, plain boring, old-styled, not gutsy.......Well, you will be sitting inside the car anyway, so you won't be able to see the front end for most of the time when you are with the car. But keep this in mind.
(5) The car key and remote control are big, actually too big to carry in your pocket. I understand Acura has built in a chip inside the key in order to start the engine ignition which is a smart design. But the draw back is that it makes the key much bigger. I can't understand why the keyless remote entry control has to be this big. Why can't Acura incorporate the car key into the remote control as one unit and even better, make the key turnable and hide it inside the remote control when it's not needed. Audi, Mercedes, and many other manufacturers have done this for a long time.

If you can live with the above small dispointments, I say you buy the car and you won't regret! It's well worth your money, especially compared with all German cars. I also encourage you to get the navigation system. It is so accurate that it actually blows me away! You want it even if you don't go out of town a lot. I use it within my town and still find it very useful. The horsepower coming out of this machine is just incredible, plus the double wishbone suspension, you could have a little race with the highway patrol buddies.
