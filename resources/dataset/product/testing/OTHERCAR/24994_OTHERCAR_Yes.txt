            I have been hunting and prowling for this camera for 2 years. I could never fin one I could afford.  Finally I hit paydirt !! $150 on ebay !!

I was NOT dissappointed.

First the camera itself.

As expected from sanyo the build quality is excellent.  It is heavy but in a good kind of way. IE it has substance. IT feels RIGID and that Coool temperature tells you what you will discover next.  METAL shell !! not cheap plastic.

All buttosn feel good.

Now there are some classic sanyo "bugs" that have always bugged me but the otherwise amazing features make you adjust to them.

I had the power switch up top.  I am always accidentally sliding it and activating the camear.

This is a problem because of the second bug.  Lousy battery life.  UNLESS you use High power nimhs.  this thing will suck a set of alkalines dry faster than you can buy and open another set of alkalines.  Almost literally.  This is why they INCLUDE 2 set of nimhs and a charger with the camera.  Being used I did not get this but I have many nimhs for my other gadgets.

If you keep 2 or 3 sets handy (it only takes 2 AA's) you will not need to really worry about running out of power if your are reasonably careful.

Nimhs are cheap nowadays.

It takes 1.5 megapixel images. This is not too bad even for taking family pictures.  It will print pretty respectable 4x6 inch prints and "ok moderate" 8x10's but you will know it digital.

As expected of sanyo it is insanely fast !! it will take pictures as fast as you can push that button.

it also has an incredible high speed mode.  640x480 images at 30 FRAMES PER SECOND !!!! for a hair over 3 seconds.  truly amazing what fun you can have with that capability.

the realy coolness of this cameara comes in its "video" modes all with sound.

It will do the sub QVA for something like 2/1 minutes at both 15 and 30 frames per second !!!! with sound !!

it will also take 320x240 at both 15 nd 30 frames per second (30 and 15 second each respectively)

And even cooler yet !! it will take 640x480 15fps video WITH sound for 15 seconds !! (not in front of me right now but I think it may 2 30 seconds at this res in low qualty mode) (there are 2 qualty settings for video Normal and Fine)

all these modes with sound.  It will also record just sound.

I use a 128mb flash card and have never filled it yet with still (over 200) but it can fill quickly with video so have larger or multiple cards handy.

Even my $1,000.00 pales in the video department.

the sanyo takes more higher quality faster than the coolpix 5000 AND only takes a few seconds to save compared to the coolpix's 73 seconds to save a 30 second video clip :-)

Obviously the coolpix whips it good in the still image arena so I carry both with me at all times.

the 1.5 mp is also MORE than adequate for ebay pics and around the house pics when you don't want or need to lug out the higher res camera.

IF you can manage to find one this Camera is a definate must buy for just about anyone.
