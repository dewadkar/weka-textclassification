 This digital is not bad I have it now for 1 and 1/2 years and I am still trying new things the first thing you will probably say is it only comes with a 16mb smart stick thats minor...Pictures are some of the best when you have the camera set correct. I will make this brief because they now have the f-717 out, not many changes but they did some color correction to the camera in either case any one of these two digitals will be a good choice. Take time and read your manual and you will have no problem using either one. If you don't like reading manuals then buy a $cheap camera because you don't have any reason to purchase this one. It has night shot, macro you name it. My advice go to your store where you are going to purchase it and mess with it, get a feel for it then make your decision. It is your investment, you be the final judge I love mine but you may not.I hope this helps a little, Thank you and God Bless.

Overview   top of page   
 


This cool digital has combining point-and-shoot convenience with a host of manual photographic controls, this camera is sure to inspire digital photographers to expand creativity and get better results. Armed with high-quality Carl Zeiss optics, ISO sensitivities of 100/200/400/800 and shutter speeds of up to 1/2000 second in auto mode which is fast, the DSC-F717 and DSC-F707 produce stellar results, even in the most demanding of shooting situations.But they do have some delay from when you push to take the picture, I still miss one or two photos when I'm trying to snap that quick picture. Sometimes I will just take several pictures in a session then edit them when I know I hit one I wanted. It is very easy to delete photos and keep shooting.
