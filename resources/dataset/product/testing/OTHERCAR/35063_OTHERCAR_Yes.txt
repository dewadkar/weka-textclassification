            When looking for an SUV replacement, I test drove every one available but the Land Rover, thinking it would be more than what we needed.  My son talked me into calling the dealership.  After 4 more test drives in different Land Rover vehicles, I was convinced.  The interior room is wonderful,handling is superb (especially on heavily snow-packed/muddy roads).  Comfort is premium, as is the sound system and climate control.  Extra seating is a plus.  Overall, a one of a kind vehicle.  The dealership was a real pleasure to do business with.  Definitely not a typical auto dealership.

Only complaint is the gas mileage, but that seems to go with SUV's.  The Disco mileage is about the same as my last SUV.

Driving my Disco has been a really outstanding experience this last year.  There have been some complaints about this engine being sluggish (slow acceleration).  I've found it to be great on the freeway and on the off-road areas I don't need fast acceleration anyway. Highway travel is very, very comfy.  Crosswinds have caused handling problems with my past vehicles, but not this one.  While driving this it's hard to tell if the wind is even blowing.  Nice!!!

Off-road performance again is a real treat.  Driven this one out of a culvert, with only two wheels touching and pulled out a AAA vehicle with the DiscoII.  One thing of note,the ACE cornering option comes with low profile tires, which are not the best on washboard roads.  There's always tradeoffs.

I would recommend this vehicle to everyone that likes off-roading and to those who just go around town (although that would be a waste). They  truly offer a very unique, pleasant driving experience.   <br><br>
