            I own a 1993 Camry station wagon V6 LE.  I am deaf and my aunt-in-law owns an auction in Alabama.  For the first time, I tried to bid on this beautiful Camry and everyone has my attention.  &quot;How can a deaf man with his interpreter (wife) do this auction and no one raise their hand after $3,500.00.  I won this car in an auction for $3,500.00.  There is nothing wrong with the car and it is in mint condition.  This car is a Blessing from God.  God knows what is the best and he gives the best.  Camry station wagon with a V6 is a rare automobile.  The mileage is now over 120,000 miles.  I bought this car because I trusted this car more than any makes.  This car has an outstanding reliability.  For a 7 year old car, I did not have any problems in three years.  Comparing to a Ford, I have to place my hand under the hood almost once a week. The car is so quiet and it rides smooth.  It gives me a confidence and security for me and my family. I owned four Toyotas since 1989.  I owned a 1981 Supra and it has over 400,000 miles on it.  Sold it in 1995.  The car was last seen in 1998 and it is still on the road.  I also owned 1993 Camry sedan before I bought the Station Wagon.  Right now, I own also own a 1993 Toyota Previa.<br><br>
