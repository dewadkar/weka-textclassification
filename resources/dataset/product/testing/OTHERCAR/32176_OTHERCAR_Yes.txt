            The Chevrolet Cavalier is one of the most affordable cars on the road. I feel the Cavalier is the best car for younger people. The price is extremely reasonable, mine was priced at $15,500 new (with some options). The car comes with standard ABS which is a must for me, living in Northern Ohio. Dual side airbags can make you feel safe while your child is out driving.(And they work! I had an accident and they both popped out...saved me from smacking my head into the steering wheel!) The interior is very cozy. It warms up or cools down fast making it very comfortable in any weather condition. And I love the power steering. This car can make the &quot;tightest&quot; turns and is so easy to parallel park and maneuver through traffic. And the car has a sporty look, which teenagers love! The dealership has been very wonderful, also. I was in an accident and they were very polite. I called almost every day to see if the car was fixed even though I knew it wasn't yet. They were very patient. Any questions or problems that arise are always welcomed and the dealership takes care of me right away. And they know who I am when I call! As many cars as they sell, I'm surprised at how well they know their customers. I am very satisfied with my car and the people who sold it to me. I would recommend them to anyone. When I bought my car, I was just happy to have been approved for the lease so, of course, I took it. I am glad to report, I have no regrets. Thank you for reading. :)	<br><br>
