            I recently purchased a Honda CR-V and I love it! This is my third Honda and my husband is on his second. My mother and sister drive them also. We all love their reliability and the fact that they retain their value so much better than other cars. 

With two children, I need the convenience of a 4-door car and I like the roominess and storage space of the CR-V. The removable table will come in handy during stops when we go on vacation. And the little extras like the fold-down drink holders and dual arm rests in the rear seat area makes it easy for everyone to be comfortable without affecting anyone else.

I will definitely recommend Honda to anyone looking for a new car...and the CR-V is a great SUV!<br><br>
