                 I test drove a Ford Ranger and an Isuzu Hombre before I chose my 2000 Dakota Quad Cab.  I found that their engines did not deliver as much  as power as the Dakota, and the ride was not as smooth.  The 3.9 Liter V6 gives you the right amount of power without making up for it in gas mileage.  Even though all the specs say the Dakota's V6 has 175 horsepower, it always seems like more.  I guess that's why they call it a MAGNUM V6.  
     The smooth ride in the 2000 Dakota really is great for trips.  You don't get bounced around like in most compareable trucks.  The four doors on the Quad Cab are also very nice for long trips.  The kids love to sit back there and sleep, read books, or listen to cd's.  The front seats also are very comfortable.  The rear seats also fold up for more storage space.  The stereo system is really great, I only wish I had gotten mine with a cd player.  
     The handling of the 2000 Dakota is the best I've seen in a truck that size.  It takes curves beautifully and can maneuver in rush-hour track very nimbly.  The Dakota Quad Cab is really like an suv with the added bonus of a truck bed.  If you don't like the size of the bed on the Dakota Quad Cab, you can get a bed-extender.
