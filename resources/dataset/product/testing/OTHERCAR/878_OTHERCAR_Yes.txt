            This is a high quality digital camera with great resolution and control abilities similar to real SLR. There are very detail function test results listed in these 2 web sites:

 http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/C33/C33A.HTM
(3000 is same as 3030 except the size of internal ram)

 some personal opinions here:

1. strange user interface: you just have to go thru all kinds of steps to set up for your preferences (sometimes I even found my setting disappear and everything turned to default) 

2. a little bit too small, no that easy to operate, usually we like our SLR easy to handle and held it steady, but 3000 is so small that is not easy to held.

beside these two complains, I like 3000 a lot. It generates great digital pictures, response time is very short, you have different choices to make it feel like a real SLR (ISO, A/S/M decision, 3x optical Zoom, ability to add-on lenses, 5 White Balance choices, great results even in low light situations) 

[plus, USB interface, remote control, ability to use AAA batteries, ability to use 64 mb smart media card....] 

However, too many choices may disturb some users, if you like SLR, this is your digital camera to buy. If you are 'point and shot' kind of person, this may drive you crazy sometimes.
