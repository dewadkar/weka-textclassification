                 I have always owned a Chrysler product.  From Plymouth, to a yellow convertible Barracuda, to 2 Daytona's (one at a time), and now to a bright Dodge Red Avenger.  And the Avenger is just the best.
     People stare and watch, probably because there are very few on the road, and also for the lines and color.  I feel young again in this good looking car.
     The front leather seats are wonderfully comfortable, but the back seats have never been used in the 15 months I've had her.  I judge that they are about big enough for midgets.
     I have no problem with acceleration, probably because little old ladies don't speed (ha ha), and have caught the car doing 85 with no effort on the back roads.  I don't speed, the car does! 
     I have everything extra that is offered, sun room, am/fm/cassette/cd,
leather seats, lumbar support, electric windows, even a garage door opener built in.  Bought it off the lot, brand new, with just 4 miles on it.
