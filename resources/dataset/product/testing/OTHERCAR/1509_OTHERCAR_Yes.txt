            I purchased a 1996 Saturn SL2 with 39k miles from my local dealer.
I love the car.  It get excellent gas mileage. The polymer panels are
a big plus except they are noisy espically in the cold winter.  The engine
is quite responsive for its size but it is rather noisy during exceleration.  I have the 4 speed electronic auto trans.  The trans shifts very smoothly. The main part of the car I do not like is the suspension.  The car is equipped with a very soft sport suspension. The ride is quite rough on smooth roads, but not unbearable.  Rough roads, and
it has a lot of bounce.  The car is very light which gives it good 0-60
exceleration but it is not that stable with high winds blowing around.
I do not have an power option to comment on.  Overall, I like my Saturn.
It was an excellent buy and is very dependable.  I would recommend it
to anyone with a tight budget wanting a sporty small car.<br><br>
