                 My family purchased a Toyota Avalon about two years ago.  We have a white fully loaded 1998 Avalon, that was purchased at Hoffman in Connecticut.  At first, my dad was looking at Consumer Reports articles comparing the Lexus and some other types and styles of cars.  For a midpriced car, the Avalons is just as much if not more &quot;bang for your buck&quot; than the lower end model made by Lexus.  
     Our 98' Avalon has got leather interior, heated seats, power windows, power seats both passenger and driver side, a sunroof, CD player, and one of the most comfortable and spacious back seats I have ever been in!  When we first got the car, and my father would get in to start the car, he would sometimes rev up the engine two or three times, because he wasn't used to the quiteness of it.  He actualy could not tell that the engine had started.  The heat in this car as in our other car, the Volvo, is great, as well as the air conditioning.  
     Most cars can take up to five minutes to warm up the engine, before you can really get some heat out of the blowers.  But in this car, the heat can get going in about 2 minutes at the most.  The heated seats also make the time go bye before you can get real heat, real fast.  The seats unlike the blowers in the car, can heat up instantly and get just warm enough to keep your fanny warm, but not too much to have to result in turning them off.  This car is also equipped with passenger, driver, and side air bags.  If you are looking for a great car for your dollar, and aren't willing to spend 35,000 for a cheap Lexus, then the Toyota Avalon is the way to go!<br><br>
