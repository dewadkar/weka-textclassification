            Although the 2nd generation Mistsubishi Eclipse GS-T is faster than many of its European and American rivals, the Eclipse doesn't seem to have made the same impact as its more illustrious competition, such as the Supra, Ford Mustang etc. This is a shame because the 2nd generation Eclipse is a blast to drive and deserves much credit for its quality, performance, and craftsmanship.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

    
At partial throttle, the 1997 Eclipse GS-T has the same street manners as the regular 140 horsepowered base model Eclipse GS. Push harder on the accelerator pedal and this sedate little package really wakes up! It's from 3,000 to 7,000 RPM where the 2.0 liter, DOHC, 16 valve turbocharged engine makes most of its power, thanks to the Garrett intercooled turbocharger. Strong brakes, sharp steering, good throttle response, and well-balanced handling round off the car's performance, making it a lot of fun on twisty roads, not to mention the fun of showing off a little tire burning at stop lights. 
Unlike the previous models (94 and earlier) the 1997 Gs-T seems much more solid, and acceleration comes much faster than the V6 powered 2000  models. The other turbo model is the GSX, which comes with everything the Gs-T has, but also comes with 'All wheel drive' which helps this car stay in line much better, remeber the powerful Gs-T is FWD so torque steer is ever so present, this is probably my only performance gripe. 

    <b>The Engine</b> only displaces 2.0 liters, but still manages to produce a whopping 210 horse power. (5 horse power shy of the 1997 V8 powered Mustang GT ). This explosive amount of power is mainly due to the Garett AirResearch intercooled turbocharger which has a maximum boost of 1.0 bar (14.5 psi). Like most current Japanese engine's, it has 4-valves per cylinder, operated by twin overhead camshafts, and multi point electronic fuel injection. Although is has undersquare cylinder deminsions, it can rev to 7,000 RPM with no fuss, with the turbo making full boost at 3,000 RPM.

    <b>Suspension:</b> The Monocoque shell of the Eclipse Gs-T convertible requires more stiffining than the hard-top version. The extensive structural enhancements include a rear deck and seat-panel, thicker sills, redesigned inner wheel arches, and a reinforced windshield frame. Wishbone suspension is used at the front,with a rear multilink system at the rear.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

 The <b>interior</b> of the 1997 Eclipse is much improved over its predecessor, and just as good as its successor ('2000  models). The convertibles come with a power top, and all the Gs-T's have standard leather trimmed seats, steering wheel, and gear knob. The sound system is excellent! My Test GS-T came with a boombing 8 speaker sound system with both a cassette, and single CD player. There is plenty of room up front, but like the older models the rear is tight. Ergonomics are near perfect and so is the drivers position which allows for good outward vision. The leather bucket seats are very comfortable and supportive even on long trips. The Gs-T comes well equipped with loads of standard amenities even with no options.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

 The <b>exterior</b> is relatively sedate, yet very sexy. Flush mounted headlamps, a curvaceous body, 16" 5-spoke alloys rims, and large Goodyear Eagle Rs-A tires can be found on the Gs-T. It's a shame this sexy design ended in the 1999 model year only present a much less desirable (for hardcore performance enthusiasts) looking sports coupe for the 2000 model year. 

  The <b>price</b> for these cars have come down quite a bit, a 1997 base model (without the turbo) can be had for around $10,000. But really, the non turbo models are all show and no go. 0-60 times with the non turbo are in the Honda civic range, while the turbo Models (GSX and GS-T) have a 0-60 time of less than 6.5 seconds ( according to specs). These tire burning models can be had for around $15,000. 

  <b>NOTE:</b> The early Models, as far as I'm concerned were lemons. After 70,000 miles most Eclipse's of the 1st generation had valve and piston wear so bad that an overhaul was necessary. So far the 2nd generations have been holding up much better. 

<i>Conclusion:</i>

The 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse represents an excellent value on the used car market. Despite some of the cheap plastics used in the interior, the Eclipse GS-T offers superior quality and performance for the price.
