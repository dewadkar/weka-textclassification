                 After weeks of researching which camera would be best for our family, we finally jumped in with both feet.  We are cutting our digital teeth on the <b>Olympus 460Z</b>, and owe a lot to <i>EPINIONS</i> for helping us to make this decision.  I have to thank kornel_911 for his fabulous tips on choosing a digital camera.  He not only introduced me to key terms, but also provided links as to where he himself learned about digital cameras.  His review can be found here (cut and paste)=&gt; <a href='/./elec-review-6D77-C797B9-38875570-bd1'>http://www.epinions.com/./elec-review-6D77-C797B9-38875570-bd1</a>  You should read betwixt's review as well.  Her review can be found here =&gt;<a href='/./elec-review-6D77-C797B9-38875570-bd1'>http://www.epinions.com/./elec-review-6D77-C797B9-38875570-bd1</a>  Between the two of these people, I learned a great deal of what to look for, and web sites to use to compare many different kinds of cameras. 

    Then I searched through <i>EPINIONS</i> to learn camera by camera, what people were saying.  This is truly eye opening.  Then, searched any buying option I could think of on the Internet, and out in town.  I went  and looked at cameras, held them in my hand, wrote down the model numbers and asking prices.  Then I went online again, and found my favorite camera, and compared prices.  (I really recommend hands down, Amazon.com.)

This being my first experience with a digital camera, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I did learn quite a bit about the market during my research time.  Here a few things that could help you pick a camera right for you, perhaps coming to the same conclusion I did, the <b>Olympus 460Z</b> provides the best quality for the best price.

		<b>1.  Be honest with yourself.  How much resolution do you really need?  </b>This is important because price is directly reflected in this decision.  The more mega pixels you have, the better quality the picture, and the more money it will cost.  The <b>Olympus 460Z</b> has 1.3 Megapixels.  This is probably mid-range for current models.  The latest ones have as many as 3.3, but really, do you need that?  The jury is still out on that one.   I selected this camera because the majority of usage will be to take snaps of my children to send to grand parents via the Internet.  I probably could have gone with a much cheaper model because computer monitors only require 640x480 for excellent resolution.  Having a bit more pixels as an option will enable me to print really good photos, or enlarge without losing quality.  It's an option that I may not use too often, but having it there is nice.

		<b>2.  Do you shoot a lot of pictures out doors?</b>  I probably will.  Therefore I needed an optical viewfinder in addition to an LCD screen.  An LCD screen can be very difficult to shoot from in bright light because you can't see.  BUT an LCD screen is important to have so that you can preview your pictures.  The <b>Olympus 460Z</b> has both.

		<b>3.  Do you need zoom?</b>  If you like to be able to zoom in on your subject, keep in mind the differences between optical zoom and digital zoom.  Many models offer both, lower priced models offer only digital.  The <b>Olympus 460Z</b> has not only a 2X digital zoom, but also a 3X optical zoom.  A digital zoom can be kind of nasty if it is all that you have to work with.  It digitally enlarges your subject, often distorting it by spreading it across the frame.  An optical zoom works similarly to one that you would have on a 35 mm camera.  A very nice feature.  <b>Olympus</b> is know for it's excellence in lens quality in all of its cameras.  

		<b>4.  Do you have room for tons of batteries?</b>  If battery life is important to you, you need to choose a camera that is battery friendly.  All digital cameras are battery hogs.  Some are worse than others.    For instance, the <i>Kodak 280</i>--the rival of <b>Olympus 460</b>, is very demanding on batteries.  The <b>Olympus 460</b> is not as bad, depending on how often you use your zoom features.  I suggest NiMH batteries, one for use, and another charging.  You may also want to purchase the A/C adapter, which is sold separately along with all the other goodies you will want to buy.

		<b>5.  Are you prepared to spend a great deal of money on your new hobby?</b>  BE HONEST.  This camera is currently selling at most retailers for $499.  I found it online for $399, a bargain.  Search, search, search!  You could possibly find it on auction!  BUT you won't be happy with your camera all by itself for very long.  This camera comes with an 8 Mb <i>smartmedia card.</i>  You will want to buy yourself 16 Mb, perhaps even 32 Mb.  Keep in mind that the higher resolution you select, the less pictures per card you will get.   Expect to pay about $40-$60 for a 16 Mb card searching for the best price, of course.  THEN you will want a cute little wallet to put those in so you won't lose or damage them.  I highly suggest a card reader to transfer your photos to your computer.  These are handy little things that make the whole transfer process quite fast and easy.  This tool will set you back about $70.  

     This <b>460Z</b> is quite cute, lightweight, and has a lens cover.  VERY handy.  I wanted this one over the others because it &quot;looks&quot; like a camera!  You may still want a case to put it in to keep your tools together.

     This was a very lengthy review, I know, but I am just so excited about our new camera!  We did so much research and I can't tell you enough about how important this is!  However, even after reading review after review, going to the store and holding it in real life was probably the best thing.  The controls and menu on the back are VERY easy to use and understand.  The one disappointing thing that I found with ALL of the <i>Olympus</i> models was that none of them include really fabulous software.  These models, all of them, come with <i>CAMMEDIA</i>.  This is adequate for transferring pictures and adjusting them, removing red eye, but it is nowhere near the caliber of software you will find bundled with <i>Kodak</i>.  

     ALL IN ALL though, I think that this is a better camera, offering huge options for its price when compared to other product lines in the same range.  This camera is a good first timer's camera because it has a lot to offer a beginner as well as many BIG features to grow into as you become more advanced.  I recommend this for any one who not only wants to send photos over the Internet, but may want to print pictures on a color printer at home as well.  The price is right, and as the market releases more high dollar, high megapixel cameras, it will come down even more.<br><br>
