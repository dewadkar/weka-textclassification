            I bought a new Mazda Protege about a year and a half ago.  I was replacing a ten year old VW Fox.  At first I loved the car.  The handling was fairly responsive, the interior roomy and comfortable.  I loved the fact that it came with a CD player as a standard feature.  My opinion of the car changed however, once summer arrived.  Once I turned on the Air Conditioning the car lost all pick up.  I had to turn off the A/C in order to go up hills or merge into traffic.  What looked like a great little car turned into a great disappointment.  About six months after getting the car I lost it in a flood.  I did not buy another, instead I went back to driving a ten year old VW.  <br><br>
