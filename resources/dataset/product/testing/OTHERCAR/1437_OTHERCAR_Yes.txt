            First I'd like to say that this is my 3rd Range Rover.  The first was a 93 long wheel base (LWB) and the 2nd was a 2000 4.6 HSE w/navigation.  I have loved and hated both of them.   

The 2003 model has SO much more room for driver, passengers and in the cargo area.  It's hard to believe just a few inches could make so much of a difference but it really does.  In the 2000 my knees were always hitting the dash when I rode in the passenger side and the rear seat was cramped, but both of those problems have been solved in the 2003.  I installed a third seat in the cargo area and in the 2000 there really wasn't room for much else, but in the 2003 the stroller fits fine and there is even a little extra room.

The navigation system was intimidating for about the first week, but basic things were easy to find such as inputting directions and using the radio.  One thing that is really neat on the 2003 is that the navigation monitor can be converted into a tv and linked to a dvd player or tv tuner.  This can't be done at the LR dealer for legal safety reasons, but I had mine done and it is really fun.  Along with tvs in the headrests and a dvd player installed the charge was about $4000.

The seat and steering wheel heater in my 2000 took a while to heat up and never really worked that well.  On the 2003, they heated up within 1 1/2 minutes and were so hot I had to turn them off after just a couple of minutes.

On the 2003 model you can program the car to ventilate itself at a specific time so the hot air is flushed out before you leave for work.  Necessary?  No, but fun just the same.

The ignition key on the 2000 was sort of like a switch blade, it popped out when you pushed a button.  The 2003 is just a plain looking key, though it does have a door lock/open button.

The car handles beautifully and isn't as growly as the 2000.  It also seems to have a quicker acceleration.  

So far I love it.

Ok, here is an update.  I have had the 2003 for 2 weeks now and got rear ended yesterday.  The Honda Odyssey that hit me was crunched all the way to the windshield.  I have a cracked bumper.  Granted my cracked bumper will probably cost every bit as much as the front end of the other car by the time I have to get  a replacement, get it painted and replace the backup sensor that was hit.

I am completely comfortable with the navigation system after only 1,000 miles of driving.  I like the truck more every day.  I was REALLY scared of what FORD was going to do, but its not so bad.  I still feel like its a FORD at times though and jump back into my 2000 for a quick fix.
