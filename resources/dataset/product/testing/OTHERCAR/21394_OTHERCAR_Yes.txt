            The new 99 Toyota Camry is the the best Camry ever, and it surely continues the line of great Camry models.  I think its greates advantage is the smooth ride.  It has the luxury car ride without a luxury car price.  It steering and braking are both well above average, and driving the Camry makes you feel good.  It also gets very good milage to the gallon. I feel safe driving in my Camry and would recomend to everbody to get one.  I use to have a 91 camry and that was also a very fine car.  It was still running well when I got the new one, and I would recomend to anybody who is looking  for a used car to buy the 91 camry.  In conclusion the camry model is still the best one out there and i would recomend to everone that they get one.<br><br>
