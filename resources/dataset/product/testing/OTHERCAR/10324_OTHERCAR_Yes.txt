            I purchased a 1990 Mitsubishi Eclipse used several years ago with 100,000 miles.  Today the car has 165,000 miles and is still running strong!  I have had to make very little repairs on this vehicle and I can hardly believe how well its stood up through years of road trips and short runs.

I admit, its not the most comfortable ride in the world.  Its a typical sports car and rides like one (as I get older I tend to notice this more).  The seats are low to the ground and the dash board is high making you feel like you're in a cockpit.  Also, visibility is less than ideal, particularly for short people.  

But wow, the reliability!  Outside normal maintenance, the only repair I've had to make to this car is to replace the clutch (mine is a manual transmission).  Its true, the cost of repairs and maintenance on foreign vehicles is higher than that of domestic vehicles, but I didn't find my costs to be very outrageous.  This car has endured many cold Minnesota winters and has started without fail everyday.

Ten years old, and this car still has no rust on it.  The cruise control, air conditioning, cassette player, power steering and power brakes all still work great.  Even the pop-up headlights still function properly.  Also, I love the style to this car.  Plus the gas mileage is unbelievable -between 30-35 miles per gallon!

One word of warning -there is one humorous glitch I should mention.  Perhaps by fluke and perhaps not, both handles to my car broke off within a week of each other last year.  These are the kind of handles you lift up on to open.  They were inexpensive to replace, but a bit of an inconvenience.  This is the only unusual repair I've had to make.<br><br>
