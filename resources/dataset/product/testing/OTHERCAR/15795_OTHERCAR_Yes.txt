            When I first heard the news that we were getting a new car I was excited. When I heard it was a minivan, the excitement quickly passed. When I thought of minivans, I would think of a junky little mom-mobile. However besides the minivan look, this minivan totally changed my expectations. 

First of all the thing that totally amazed me was the power of this vehicle. Not once while driving it did I ever feel that there wasn't enough power to get the car moving. Even on the freeway I could accelerate and pass other cars with ease. Also there were many times when I could out accelerate cars off a green light if needed.

The looks of this minivan is also a plus. One of the features that stands out the most are the alloy wheels. This gives the car a sporty luxury look despite being a minivan.

The best aspect about this car by far is the inside. There are countless amenities that are worth mentioning. First, there are the standard features that you would expect such as air conditioning, AM/FM radio, etc. However the features that set it apart from other minivans are things like leather, doors on each side, easily removable seats and wood inlays. When thinking about what totally blows the other minivans in this class is the audio system. The system reflects the quality of this car. The speakers aren't some poorly made stock speakers, they are made by infinity which has great quality. Also it has the integrated AM/FM CD cassette player. These luxury items should be enough for any family.

In conclusion, if you can afford the high price of this van, go for it...otherwise try a similar model like the grand voyager, either way you won't be disappointed.<br><br>
