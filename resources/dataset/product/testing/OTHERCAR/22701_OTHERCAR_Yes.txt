            When I was a senior in high school, I bought my first car. Months before I bought my car, I had already decided what I wanted. I wanted an emerald green Neon with tan interior. I searched until I found it. I bought my 1995 Plymouth Neon Highline in March of 1996. It was used with 39,000 miles on it, but it was exactly what I wanted. It was emerald green and it had tan interior. I didn't like the gray interior, I thought it made the car look too dark inside. I still have this car today. I think my car looks like a frog. It is green and the way the front of shaped gives it that look, so I named my car Froggie. I have babied this car. I change the oil every 3,000 miles, get tune ups, etc. My car now has 125,000 miles on it. Most of the miles are highway miles. I travel a lot and I take my car with me. I haven't had any major problems with my car at all, just minor things that all cars need. I have gotten a new fuel filter, had my fuel injection system cleaned out (due to trash in my gas tank), my sensors replaced, and I had to get an AC line fixed. I would have to say that my favorite feature about this car is the sun visor. On the drivers side there is a part that slides out and goes almost to the rear view mirror to blocks the bright sun on in the afternoons on the drive home from work or school.
This is a very dependable and affordable car. I have thought about buying a new car, but I just can't part with my Neon. I love it too much. <br><br>
