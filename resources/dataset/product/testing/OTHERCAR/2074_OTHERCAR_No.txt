            I was driving a Volvo 850 with all the trim.  It, however, was averaging only 28 miles to the gallon and I was putting almost 400 miles a week on the car.  We decide that a new diesel was better suited to my commuting needs than was my 20 valve overhead cam Volvo.  After a little Internet research we decided on the Volkswagen Jetta TDI (Passat was no longer being produced in a diesel).  We found that most dealers had at least one new Jetta TDI on the lot.  The GL package type had ugly interiors with multicolored patterned fabric seats.  Fortunately, we found one with a GLS package minus the sunroof and CD changer.  It was the same color as our Volvo with a navy blue exterior and tan interior.  The seats were an attractive "upgraded" solid color velour.  The sticker price was $19,500.  We picked it up for $18,000.  We felt pretty good about our purchase.

In the last 3 months I have put 4600 miles on it and the following list are issues that would cause me to rethink my decision if I had it to do again.

The interior is far too small.  My two year old son keeps his feet thrown over the top of the front seats while in his car seat.  Yes, he is tall, but not that tall!  Putting his car seat directly behind the driver seat is out of the question and to put him behind the passenger means making sure your passenger does not push the seat all the way back or you could injure the child�s legs.  So put him in the middle and let him throw his feet up! This might cause a problem should he decide to continue growing!!

The front seats are basically comfortable, however, they do not have enough adjustment features, especially if you have any back problems.  I find myself leaning heavily to the right to compensate for lack of comfortable positioning.

The driver�s side door does not always shut completely.  An alarm will sound, however, I have noticed that after a short amount of time the warning bell stops and if you forget to open and re shut the door, you will find yourself driving down the road with a door ajar.  This can happen when you are distracted by the necessities of  settling children in the car.

The exterior mirrors are electrically controlled which is a nice feature accept that the single control button is difficult to manipulate.

We had the upgraded "velour" seats treated ($299) for stain prevention at the dealership.  I hope it works because whatever they put on the seats does not keep liquids from seeping into the fabric quickly and discoloring it.  Nor does it keep every lint particle you wear from collecting on the seat.  I wear a lot of dark colors and you would swear that my tan velour seats were tan and black!

There are some things I actually do like about the car.  I love the 47 mpg.  It also has decent acceleration for a small car and the clutch is not temperamental.  It handles very solidly with great steering and braking.  Some of the nice features are the new style key with electric locks, alarms, cruise control, telescope steering wheel, intermittent windshield wipers, and the absolutely awesome blue dash lights are great features.

As I stated above, for commuters, it is a great car, for people who taxi kids or friends in the back seat, it simply does not make the mark!

As I have only had the car for three months, there is always the chance that it will grow on me, however, as I have discovered that size and comfort are as important to me as fuel economy, I doubt it!
