            This is my 4th Volvo, and by far the best yet. I test drove the S70 T5 and the standard S70 and found the GLT to be the best of the 3 models. The T5 has explosive power when the turbo kicks-in and the standard S70 doesn't have enough juice at all. The GLT's light pressure turbo gives it to you when you need it...with smooth delivery. The one I bought has all the options except leather seats. The TRACS front wheel drive system gets you though just about any snow and the ABS brakes are as &quot;natural&quot; feeling as they come. I was impressed with the CD stereo system and 8 thumping speakers. No after-market stereo needed here. The automatic climate control system works really well too. Impressive mileage, great power, luxury ride and that legendary Volvo safety. The transferrable 100K warranty is cool too. One drag is that the insurance company rates this as a full turbo category car (same as the T5). Another is the painted bumpers. They show every (tight) parallel parking experience you have.<br><br>
