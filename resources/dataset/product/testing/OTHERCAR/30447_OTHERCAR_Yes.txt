            As a rule, I don't feel respect for inanimate objects, but my '82 Corolla 4-door station wagon is an exceptional case. I can't help but remember it through a haze of awe and reverence. It was in our family for nearly 15 years, and survived five years of very punishing teenage &quot;F-16 fighter&quot; style driving - in San Francisco, no less. I used to 'catch air' in Louise, maybe 4 to 8 inches between the tires and the road, over the steep drop-offs at the tops of many San Franciscan streets. The wise engineers at Toyota must have forseen this and designed the Corolla's suspension and undercarriage accordingly - who'd have expected to find the skeleton of a sports-car in this little 120-horsepowered roof-rack'ed beastie? Or brakes that could, time and again, save the driver from sudden death at the end of a 250-yard &quot;free fall&quot; (turn off the motor, put 'er in neutral, and let 'er roll..) from the top of famously steep streets like Union and Hyde?

I played out my youthful death instinct in this cop-friendly speedster (what cop could believe his radar (95!?), glancing after a mild-mannered compact econo-station wagon like that) , routinely pushing the poor little 4-cyclinder 8-valve engine to what must have been (by the sound of it) the 5500-to-6500 rpm range, and never once did it have trouble. Regular tune-ups, change the oil every 3 to 5K miles - it was passed on to my brother, and eventually sold at the ripe old age of 220,000 miles - but I hear the life expectancy is near 300K, with proper geriatric care. 

If you come by one of these in good condition, with fewer than 200 grand on the odometer - snap it up. Quiet, stylish, spacious, plush - it's none of the above. In lieu of those superfluities, you'll get from Point A to Point B, forever.  <br><br>
