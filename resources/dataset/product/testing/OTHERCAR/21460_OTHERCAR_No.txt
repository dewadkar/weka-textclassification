            Mitsubishi has had a good reputation in the past for sports cars.  We once could buy a second generation Eclipse turbo all-wheel-drive car which was a tuner's dream for many and the predecessor to this third generation car.  We could also purchase the 3000GT, one of the most remembered Japanese sports cars in the US.

I test drove this car in search for something sporty be it a sports car or not.  In truth, I was really looking for a sports sedan but seeing enough of these on the road and having decent paper specs, I'd give it a fair chance and test drive it.  After some spirited drives, I can say that it's too bad Mitsubishi decided to send us this car as the its only entry in the sports car market.

If you subscribe to the stereotype "chick mobile", this is a good definition.  For those who don't know, it means a car that looks cute and sleek but offers not alot else.  The VW Cabrio is a perfect example.

The 2nd gen Eclipse with its tuner's dream of an engine and AWD was a favorite.  But then, they introduced this one: the 3rd generation.  It went downhill from there.

Lets start inside.

Step inside and the interior is well built but average in terms in quality, not on par with the best but reasonable.  There is a very nice amount of airbags and the dash is well layed out.  The stereo is easy and simple to operate and while not ear pounding a reasonable unit.  The materials, however, seem very cheap and plasticky.  It has the feel of a boy racer car which does fit the image but still fitting in higher quality materials would at least make the car feel the price.

On the outside, the car has a bold image.  Anyone wanting a sports car wants to make a bold statement.  Its a coupe, with a rounded C-pillar and wavey indentions in the doors.  This adds to the cars aggressive, young nature.

For me, this was a strike in the book.  It seemed to be brash and aggressive to the point of fault.  This is a purely subjective, of course, I prefer the understated, clean look.  Its not a mature sport look like say an Audi TT but thats not its intended audience.  Its competition is the Toyota Celica or the Mustang.

Once we head into the guts, this is where the machine fails to be inspiring.  The 3.0 is a single overhead cam borrowed from a galant.  The lack of dual cams let alone variable value timing means it fails to rev that high.  In this case, that means the engine redlines at 5500 RPM.  Yes, it generates 200lb/ft of torque but its rather peaky instead of flat.  The engine is dull and lifeless.  With peaky torque and a low red line, it doesn't deliver much push consistantly nor does it let you scream to a high RPM like a race car.  The 2.4 4-banger is even more forgetable.

Now the handling.  The taste of American sport car buyers tend to be skewed towards the speed and acceleration type.  And with that criteria, this car isn't half bad.  But if you go onto more interesting and important aspects, such as road feel, handling, and steering weight, the view changes.

As for the car, you would think something like this turns well but wait.  The engine is a large iron block that sits in front of the axel AND is a front wheel drive car.   Not only that, the front is a MacPherson strut design and doesn't employ the pricier double wishbones or derivative multilink designs for better camber control.  Already in my mind a warning bell starts to go off.

After driving a bit, my evaluation of the paper specs confirmed the worst: <i>this is a formula for disaster</i>.  I drove the car at a decently high speed in the corners and you could feel the weight slosh back and forth.  Not only that, the poor weight ratio and soft spring rates coupled with poor camber control made it understeer horribly at the limit.  As I rounded a tight corner at speed, the soft MacPherson struts can't cope with the power and the inside wheel started to lose traction.  Another consequence of this design is poor steering feedback.  It feels like any family sedan driving with no idea of what's going on near the tarmac.  That meant I couldn't tell that I was losing traction until I felt the body starting to twitch and plow.  This generation's lack of AWD (all wheel drive) also didn't help.

Conclusion:
We know Mitsubishi has done better with those past Eclipses and 3000GT's.  We also know that they know how to create a geniunely incredible car today as in the Lancer GSR Evolution VII.  Too bad we can't purchase this car here in the US as its the only real sports car Mitsubishi manufactures.

What car do you get instead then?

Here's a few recommendations:
#1 choice: Toyota MR2 - There aren't any inexpensive(relatively) mid-engined cars that are new.  Ask any in the know about handling and you will know hear that mid-engine cars's lower polar moment of inertia and near 50/50 weight distribution is the best way to get great handling.  Short of getting a Porsche, this is the only one.

Other choices:
Toyota Celica -  It is more reliable with a similiar styling but much better handling and a great modern engine Wow it has variable valve timing! Geee, what a concept that the 3.0 Eclipse doesn't even offer.  

Ford Mustang GT - A great bargain with a huge displacement small block V8.  No pretentions about great handling here with a live axel rear but the power is just incredible.  It comes standard with a relatively stiff suspension so its handling should supercede the Eclipse as well.

Acura RSX - Probably a little too mature for someone who wants an Eclipse, but nonetheless a great driving machine.  Honda makes the best non-turbo 4-bangers in the business and this is a great handling car as well.

Mercury Cougar - Based off the highly praised Ford Mondeo platform, also a great choice.

What did I end up with?  An Audi A4.  But that's another story.
