            I brought this camera along with me to Egypt for about forty days this year. I had already been using this camera for about a year. While in Egypt I used the camera extensively and was very impressed. Every time I took it out of the case it was subjected to powder-like sand in the breeze. I never had a problem with loading or picture quality. I think the best part was being able to walk to a laptop and send pictures of the pyramids home to my family within an hour of me seeing them. Picture quality isn't the best. But the camera is best used for the purpose of getting photos into a presentation fast. <br><br>
