            A year and almost 30,000 miles after the purchase of my Mitsubishi Mirage, I can honestly say that I'm happy with my decision.  It has fulfilled my need for an inexpensive, reliable, fuel-efficient vehicle.

At a cost of under $12,000 for a program car with a bit over 13,000 miles on the odometer, it suited my limited budget.  Since my business travels result in a high annual mileage, the 50,000 mile factory warranty was vital to my peace of mind.  The Mirage has gotten me safely to my destination and home again every day but one.  The battery died about 3 months after the purchase and left me stranded.  Scary and inconvenient?  You bet!  In all fairness, the dealership replaced the defective battery under the terms of the warranty and had me back on the road in less than 30 minutes.

Most of my travel is highway mileage and the Mirage has given me good fuel economy, averaging between 30-35 mpg depending on speed and road conditions.  It runs well using &quot;regular&quot; octane fuel.  I've never noticed any engine &quot;pings&quot;, it starts fine, and the engine runs smoothly.  Even adding in the cost of routine oil changes, it's been easy on the pocketbook.  I've had to replace one tire but since the other 3 are holding up well, I suspect the damage may have been the result of some type of road hazard.

As for comfort, my model has no &quot;bells and whistles&quot; but there is ample leg and head room and the seats are reasonably comfortable.  Levers for adjusting seat distance from the steering wheel and the position of the seat back are conveniently located and operate smoothly.  The seat height adjustment range could be improved a bit.  For a short person, the seat still feels too low at it's highest position.  Dash panel controls are functional and easily accessible from the driver's seat.  A pull-out beverage holder works well for containers with bottoms no larger than a standard soft drink can but has openings too small for the larger insulated mug I prefer to use.  Glove box and console storage compartments are roomy enough for owner's manual, registration papers, cassettes, etc.  There are two handy compartments on the lower front door panels which are perfect for maps.  Trunk space is surprisingly roomy for a compact car.  The air conditioner/heater regulates the temperature quickly and evenly.

While the braking system responds well on dry roads, stopping on a wet surface can be harrowing.  Braking time is a bit too long and the car skids more easily than other vehicles I have owned.  Power steering is responsive on straight roads, but don't even think about taking sharp curves or turns at more than a snail's pace.  You will literally slide through the entire turn with tires squealing if you go into it at speeds above 25-30 mph.  Another drawback is the lack of spunk when you need a little speed.  Although there is a decent passing gear when you floor it at highway speed, from a standstill even flooring it won't get you out of harm's way in a hurry.  All considered, I doubt you will ever see a Mirage in a Grand Prix race!

In spite of the drawbacks, the Mirage is definitely worth checking out if you're in the market for a low-priced, reliable workhorse.  You will find it economical and comfortable so long as you don't expect luxury and frills.  My sister was so pleased with her Mirage after 4 years that she decided to purchase a Gallant when the need arose for a larger car.  After another 100,000 miles or so, I have no doubt that I'll still be happy enough with mine to make the same decision.
