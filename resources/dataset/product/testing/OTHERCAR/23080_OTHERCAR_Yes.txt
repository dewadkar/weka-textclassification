            I have never owned a digital camera before.  I was a little afraid to start using my PDC640.  I've had it for about a month.  I look like a pro.  It's very easy to operate.  The program is easy too.  One of the best features is, being able to show the pictures to everyone immediately through the LCD display.  I can retake a picture if it didn't turn out right.  That's something you can't do with a regular camera.  So, I don't miss getting a good shot of a one-time special occasion.  I have been telling everyone I know about this camera.  It's great!
It works well with other programs too.  I have the Cosmo make-over program and my sister's love coming over and getting a picture taken, then instantly popping it into the Cosmo program.  I use it for email too.
I was at a family function and took a bunch of pictures, as soon as I got home I sent them to everyone.  They loved it.
The price was very reasonable too.  Polaroid is a name I trust. <br><br>
