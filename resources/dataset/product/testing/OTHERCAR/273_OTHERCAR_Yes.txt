            My last 35 mm point and shoot Yashica started scratching the films so I retired it. I was impressed with the digital photos I have seen, so I knew I wanted to try a digital camera. I had always liked Yashica but couldn't find a cheaper digital version of it so I researched other brands. The Olympus D510Z camedia 2.1, 64 mb 3x zoom is just the happy medium for me. I plan to keep it for 3-5 years before upgrading again.
When I got the Olympus D510 Z, it took me about an hour to figured it out how to use it, considering I am one of those type of customers that hates reading manuals. The first mistake was not to extend the lens cover completely (until it clicks). After taht, it was straight forward for taking pictures. The menus were a bit more complicated to figure it out. I am sure it is easy if you read the manual, I just play and find out. But, always make sure to read the short intro manual and safety part.
The compact size is very good, about the size of a pda and twice its weight. The color is dark grey. The lcd has a good resolution and actually shows the target very clearly even outdoors or under dim lights. However, the actual picture is much brighter than the one you see in the lcd when you shoot the photo.
This camera compensates very well, automatically, for dim lights. I took couples of pics in candle lights, and to my surprise they came out very nice, neither over nor under compensated, with that depht quality that you get in regular 35 mm. Also, this camera takes great pictures in a room, night or day, without proper lighting: the pictures come out as if there were taken under perfect lighting, incredibly clear. It takes fantastic outdoor photos. The quality is still great in 8x11 pictures if you shoot them HQ mode.
Downloading and viewing the pictures to my desktop computer was easy, almost foolproof. Just install the software then connect the camera to your desktop. Click and drop to your desktop to save them. No brainer. I download my pictures them often so I have plenty of space for more pics in the memory card, at High Quality mode, you can take 15 photos. I usually snap 30 photos before the battery sign comes up red. However, after resting for the night, the camera still works fine for more rounds of photos. I don't understand why this is.
The preview and delete features are very easy to use and learn.
A small cons would be the small viewfinder. I wear eyeglasses and in between my eyeglass frame and the viewfinder, tehre are 10 seconds lost in positioning it in the exact position, though I could learn to rely now on the ldc screen instead. 
So far, I used every feature except the video part because don't do much videotaping.
I bought it new/refurnished from ubid for 190$.
I thought I would need more memory space, but actually I don't since I download them as soon as I take photos to my computer.
I find myself using this camera more often now instead of my other new point and shoot Pentax. 

Update: since my first review, I have taken about 100 pictures with this camera. Some of them, taken inside a car while moving at 40 mph, came out blurry. Same blurry pictures when taken inside a darker room, with a timer. The colors were very good, just somewhat blurry overall.
The pictures under the sun (4PM) where the sun casted a shadow over the face, came out too dark. The scenery around were excellent---blue sky and verdant bushes, but the face and neck under the sun was too dark to see the expression. I took another photo in the exact position with the Pentax and it came out with much clearer and brighter picture of the face.
