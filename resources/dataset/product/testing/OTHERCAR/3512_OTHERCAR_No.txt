            I�m probably going to sound either incredibly inept or stupid trying to review this digital camera, but I�ll give it my best shot (pun, get it?). I have always been electronically-challenged and therefore not a photography enthusiast. Guys just want to take pictures of me and I simply don�t take them, but a couple months ago I bought this camera because my sweetie has been drooling for one and it sounded like a good buy at the time. Best Buy, though, has just come out with an even better camera in this HP Photosmart series for just as much.

<b>Why did I buy it?</b>
<i>
1.	It has 2.1 Megapixels.
2.	About $300.
3.	Connects to both Windows PC and Macintosh.
4.	Works with Windows 98, W Me, W 2000, W NT 4.0
5.	8 MB card, 2.5x digital zoom
6.	No better choice.</i>

<b>How does it work?</b>

Tim set the time and date first off, then took it with him to a murky bar where he would play darts. When he scanned the pictures, I noticed some lighting flaws and inconsistencies. The guys he took pictures of, including himself, had ruddy faces while the women were white as ghosts. Tim definitely isn�t ruddy-faced like that, so I wasn�t pleased. He also took a picture of our first snowfall and the snow was gray.

He then caught me on camera before my computer with a bright lamp on later that night, which you can see on the side of this page hopefully. I think the lighting is okay, but it lacks focus.

After taking more shots of friends in Halloween gear and relatives in his hometown another weekend, dark backgrounds looked fine, but light ones looked gray, especially if a bright lamp wasn�t available. You�re thinking we could have adjusted the image LCD brightness and adjusted the photo quality to a better setting since there are three (Basic, Fine and Superfine). You may be right.

It would seem that Tim wasn�t aware of the battery icon on the status LCD, either, because when he used the camera at Thanksgiving, none of the five pictures he took were very distinguishable. Magnifying two of them allowed us to recognize the people, but the rest just got worse until the last was black. The battery icon would have told him if it was full, partially charged or empty, although he probably is so used to driving on empty that he thought the battery worked the same way, hehe.

However I just checked the battery icon and it showed that the battery is partially-charged and my girlfriend even took four pictures with it just a few days ago and the lighting was fine. (Tim has just given me a physics lesson, saying that if you take more than three pictures at a time, the power degrades and the pictures lack quality.) 


<b>Could we fix his pictures?</b>

In a word, no. Tim finally told me to download �Gif Builder� at download.com because there is no way to adjust the lighting of the pictures when they�re scanned. Tim used the words, �no web conversion software�. We didn�t see a zoom feature, either, (although you can take pictures with a zoom feature, but quality is compromised) and he tried right-clicking which then let us shrink it only and the picture couldn�t be dragged. It stayed in a box and we had to move it around inside that to see what was in the picture.

Yeah, you're laughing now. Well, it wasn't very funny <i>for us</i>!

<b>My Novice's Recommendation</b>

Tim just reminded me of the User�s Guide on the desktop so I wouldn�t have to flip pages of the book. I�m sure it is more convenient and easy to read, so remember that if you get this. Maybe one needs to understand physics, too? I never read that in the User's Guide about taking more than three pictures.

Anyway, it uses four AA batteries of lithium or alkaline, but they won�t recharge with an AC adapter, only conserve the batteries. I�m not sure how long they last since the camera�s been used a little over a month for about fifty pictures. They can�t be adjusted, though, without downloading a program like GIF Builder, or so Tim concluded. If I�m wrong, blame him, the guy who just fixed my computer! 

I would only recommend this camera if you live where no other higher-quality cameras are available and/or you�re not willing to spend more. I wouldn't recommend taking more than a few shots at one time, either!

If you have any questions, comments or advice, please don�t hesitate. I�d love to hear from you! I promise I'll never attempt this kind of review again. :-)
