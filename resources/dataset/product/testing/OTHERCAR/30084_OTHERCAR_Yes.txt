            Digital cameras are here to stay. As much as I'd like to stay with my old SLR, it's time to move from film to disk. I've had the Kodak 280 for 3 months and I'll say that it was a good buy. The pictures are very good, it's easy to use - just point and click. As with any automatic camera, you don't have great control over exposure and lens settings, but for indoor and typical outdoor shots, its fine. The USB downloads fast compared to serial. The rechargeable batteries dye after about 30 downloaded pictures to your PC... get the optional AC cable (I think 39$). 

Everything digital is overpriced for what it is. My camera does sometimes act quirky; but I think it always has to do with low batteries. You'll have to get another set of the rechargeable nickel metal hybrid batteries if you go on the road with your camera. And the software is ok. 

The downloading should be easier when you don't want to touch up your photos.  I'll keep my 35 mm SLR for those vacation trips where I'll take 10 rolls of film and I want more camera control, but if you want instant, good quality pictures in an everyday, take it anywhere camera (as long as you don't need more than 35 pictures before downloading), this is the camera. Or you can take your laptop with you or buy more overpriced memory cards.
