            I purchased my Z34 in January, 1992. It has served my family well. It is dependable: the Dual Twin Cam motor and the 4T60E transmission are both reliable and strong. The thing I like most is the confidence it gives a driver: it can be "tossed" around and holds the road quite well for a mid-sized car. The engine has enough performance to get you down the road authoritatively to merge with traffic. The cloth seats have held up well in 10 years, and the car still receives its share of looks. I am purchasing a new vehicle, but the Z34 is staying in the family--my son will be the proud second owner.
