            Ready or not it's soccer mom time!  Right after the birth of our son we traded in my truck for this 1996 caravan.  Mentally not ready to be a &quot;soccer mom&quot; I reluctantly gave in and agreed to get it.  Other than the mental thing I loved it!  At first.  It ran great, had get up and go power, and was spacious enough for everything and everybody. Then we smelled gas.  Every time we filled it up it would reek of gas.  Upon looking under the van we saw the drip drip drip.  The van has an open recall to replace fuel tank O-ring seal.  It also has a recall to replace the fan relay.  The only other �bugs� I have found with this van are something is alive in the windshield wipers.  They turn on at their own will and sometimes I can�t get them to turn off.  If driving for long periods of time without stopping it will sometimes die when you slow down to turn or when you come to a complete stop.  And the breaks get hot easy and make a grinding sound.  Have taken it in to have them looked at and was told they are fine but that they get hot and make that sound.  It handles nice and is a smooth ride.  It has plenty of room for everything you may need.   The heater and A/C work really great!  Loved the amount of cup holders.  Seats are easy to remove but quite heavy once you get them out.  All and all this is a good vehicle for those that are ready to get a mini-van.  I never really want it, there for I never really liked it.  <br><br>
