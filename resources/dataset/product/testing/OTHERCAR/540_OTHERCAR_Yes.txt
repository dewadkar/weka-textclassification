            Granted, The 2000 Accent is not an exciting car, but not everyone wants (or can afford) an exciting car. The Accent's main draw is value.  Priced below many used cars, the Hyundai Accent offers new car ownership at a used car price.  If you've owned, driven, or even ridden in an older Hyundai - forget it !  In fact Hyundai hopes everyone will forget all  their cars of the past.

Inside the new Accent, materials are surprisingly high quality and have a very contemporary look.  Radio,  A/C and cup holders all have a brushed metallic look, one might even call it cool looking.  A digital clock  and rear widow defroster are an excellent value  in this price range.  Seats are somewhat small but surprisingly comfortable.  Many more expensive cars don't offer as many seat adjustments as in the Accent, and a driver side arm rest is great for trips.  Headroom is plentiful.  Rear seat room is adequate, not cramped, but certainly not roomy.  The rear hatch area offers plenty of cargo room.  Don't expect to haul any 2x4's, but sports equipment and a weeks worth of groceries will fit nicely with room to spare.  In the base Accent, windows and door locks are strictly manual, that's right you'll have to (gasp!) roll down your own windows.  Let's face it, you can't have everything  AND save money.  Many cars in this budget segment have underpowered A/C, offering cooling only on moderately hot days.  The Accent's A/C blows cold and easily cools off the entire cabin, even as the California sun pushed the temperature over 100.

On the road, the Accent has a softer ride than you'll find in most cars this size.  The soft suspension makes for un-sporty handling around town, but a very pleasant ride on the highway.  Speaking of the highway, the 2000 Accent has so little road noise, you'll swear you paid more than $9,000.  The 5-speed shifts with such ease, moving the lever almost seems unnecessary - it's switch like.   On the down side, the Hyundai 4-cylinder is underpowered.  If you shift later than usual, more power can be found, but 92 hp is simply not enough.  Compare to the KIA which gives you an almost sporty 125 hp (10 hp more than a New Beetle).   Although the engine is underpowered, it does offer smooth and quiet normally reserved for bigger more expensive cars.  Tires are too skinny and the wheel covers look cheap.

Overall the 2000 Hyundai Accent is a reasonably competent car.  For the price of many used cars, often with 50 or 60,000 miles, you can own a brand new car with a factory warranty.  There is plenty of usable space, and quality is much improved compared the lowly Excel of the 1980s.  You'll also get a surprisingly smooth and pleasant ride.  The Accent will not wow anyone, except maybe the owner who paid under $10,000 for a new car.
