            My friend bought him a 2000 Dodge Dakota a few weeks ago and i think it is awesome.  His is a v8.  He has all the bells and wistles and so forth.  He decided to go with a standard transmission.

The truck is the best looking truck on the market.  With the v8 engine, it is very powerful, and i have no doubt that it could pull a trailer easily.  The inside is roomy, if you are sitting in the front,  if there are more than 2 going we will take more than his truck though, the back seats are very uncomfortable.  

The tires that came with it are very good tires but with the 50-50 handling package that he got on it they are wearing out very very quick.  The gas mileage isnt to bad if you consider that he is driving a v8.  

The stock stereo isn't that bad, of coarse he got the infinity set though.  The only thing i don't really like is that the truck feels a little too much like a big truck.  Mine feels like a small truck, his feels like a full size, but it handles much better.

The dodge people thought of about everything, on the ceiling of the cab there is a place for your garage door opener, and a place to hold your sunglasses.  Its not something that would make your decision for you but its nice to know that they were thinking about everything.  

I also like the fact that they give you a spare tire with the same tire and rim on it as the rest of the truck.  The only unfortunate thing about getting the truck was the wait, they had to order it. Which took over a month.

I think the truck is a very dependable truck.  Its good for just a ride or if you really need it for something, like towing another car or a trailer.

go buy it you know you want.<br><br>
