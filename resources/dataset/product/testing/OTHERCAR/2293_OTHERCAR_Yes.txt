            When I told a friend about my new Kia, he thought I bought a new dog.  Apparently, not everyone has seen those commercials with a giant odometer on top of a Sephia yet.
Kia is second to Hyundai as the largest automobile manufacturer in Korea. Sales of their flagship car, the Sephia, surpassed a significant milestone in September as the company sold its 100,000-unit for 1999.  Sales skyrocketed 61 per cent over the year and they show no signs of slowing down, and for good reason.
The Sephia is quite simply one of the best cars in its class.  With a price tag of just over $12,000(Canadian), the price is hard to beat.  Standard equipment is excellent with only few options.
The front-engine, front-wheel drive Sephia comes only as a four-door sedan with one engine available.  The 1.8-liter, inline-4 produces a respectable 125 hp; more than the base Chevy Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire.  By no means, however, is the 16-valve engine going to push you back in your seat, but it is powerful enough to pass without fear.
The transmission, which is available as a four-speed auto or 5-speed manual, shifts smoothly, but it runs very loudly under hard acceleration.  Quite contrary to the sound level in the car during regular city driving.  I found myself on many occasions wondering if the car was even on.  
Despite the compact exterior the Sephia's interior is roomier than a mid-sized Ford Contour.  With almost 95 cu. ft. of passenger space, a five-person trip wouldn't pose any problem. The fabric is well crafted but the roof is made from plastic and is very cheap looking. A good example of how Kia kept the price down.  
Cargo space is equally impressive with 10.4 cu. ft. in the trunk. 
The Sephia is very ergonomically correct with easy access to the stereo and other controls.  Though the instrumentation is rather bare with only a speedometer, fuel gauge and temperature gauge.  A tachometer would have been nice and the other gauges are, unfortunately, in the form of dummy lights.
Bringing the 2,500 lb. Sephia is no problem with the very capable front disc, rear drum, ABS brakes.  If I didn't know about the braking set-up, I would have guessed that they were four-wheel discs.
Along with the ABS brakes, another safety feature is dual standard air bags.  Traction control, however, isn't available.
Standard equipment on the Sephia includes dual outside mirrors, rear defroster, tinted glass and adjustable cup holders.  Options include speed-sensitive power steering with tilt, folding rear seats, A/C, power locks and windows, cruise control, spoiler and a CD stereo.
Gas mileage is extremely impressive running at 24 mpg in the city and 31 on the highway.
With a wheel-base of only 100 inches the tiny Kia runs through the city with the greatest of ease.  Steering is a bit tight but it corners with minimal body roll.  The gas pedal is extremely sensitive; you can almost blow on it and it would accelerate. 
All Kia's come with a convincing three-year/ 36,000 mile bumper to bumper, roadside assistance warranty.
Competition for the Sephia includes the Toyota Corolla, Hyundai Accent and the Daewoo Lanos.  The Kia is priced lower than all of them but the quality on some features, such as the plastic roof and the plastic dash, lacks quite a bit of style. 
So if you're looking for a car that is fun to drive and your budget won't allow you to buy Porsche, then the Kia Sephia is just right for you.  Just don't expect a leather wrapped steering wheel or a tiptronic transmission.
