            This SUV competes with the Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4, Chevy Blazer, and GMC Jimmy. It is competitively prices and a head turner. 

The interior is roomy and comfortable. On long or short trips the front and rear seats are comfortable. The stadium seating in the back is appreciated by the young and the old- allowing them to see out the front windshield. 

The interior is simple and easy to use- just your basic dashboard. Climate controls and Radio controls are easy to reach, see, and use while driving. 

Enough cargo area and rear seats fold down giving you more room if needed. Our xterra came with bungee cords and hooks in the rear. 

The Xterra has been compared to the handling and ride to other SUV's in its class but you have to understand that the Xterra is built on the Frontier frame (a pickup TRUCK) while other SUV's are built on car frames. The X drives and handles comfortably but it is a TRUCK- if you want a "car ride" stick with the Honda or Toyota! 
Compared to other SUV's in it's class- you can take the Xterra off-roading. 

We've owned our X for 5 months now and have had a problem with the heat shield rattling but brought our X into service and it was fixed within 15 minutes! Service at Nissan is very friendly and quick! You can also check out www.xterraownersclub.com for other problems that people have had! 

People who are looking for a truck/suv should test drive the Xterra...many people have stated that it is underpowered- we found that it drives like a TRUCK- you will not win any races with this truck but it gets the job done and comfortably! The truck has no problem doing 75-80. The gas mileage is another concern- the truck averages about 16 mpg- it is a truck and not a car! 

If you don't mind the gas mileage I would recommend this truck! It is a comfortable ride, nice handling, off road capable, and roomy. 

Test drive before you buy! Nissan is also redesigning the 2002 models with a supercharged engine for some of the people who feel that the Xterra is underpower.
