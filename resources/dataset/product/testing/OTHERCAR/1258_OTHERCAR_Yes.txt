               The Nikon Coolpix 990 camera is one of the better cameras I've ever used.It has the 3x zoom nikkor lens with 38mm to 115mm coverage for very sharp images.It has the 4896 step multi area auto focus for quick compensation and 256 element matrix metering and white balance.
   I feel that this is one of the best digital cameras that you can buy for under $1000.The battery lasts over 300 exposures and it's very solid.
We use this camera for all family activities,plus my husband uses it while he's on the road driving.I love the photographs and the high quality of this camera.You will always get the highest quality images with this camera.
   This camera has so many wonderful features and is worth every penny.
With the 3x Optical Zoom you can size the picture without reducing the quality of the image.This is a great value for the money and I highly recommend this camera for terrific pictures.I know this camera will really come in handy through the holidays.
