            This review should be under 340R Digital Camera.  I made a mistake and put it under 360L.
Please go to the 340R Digital Camera Olympus site.

The digitals scared me.  Even though I am a computer geek the cameras just seemed too complicated.  And to a certain degree they are.  To this day I don't feel comfortable with the digital, having used it only three times in one year.  However, I expect that to change as I can see the value in immediate photos and sharing photos across the internet.

The instructions for the camera in my opinion were very complicated.  It will require that you sit down and read through one time and then go back to set up.  The instructions are divided in English and a foreign language.  I absolutely hate instruction manuals in foreign language.  
There is photoshop software that comes with it.  This enables you to edit the photo; however Adobe Photoshop is NOT an easy program to learn.  I took a Photoshop class and to this day cannot tell you how to maneuver through the program.

The little icons on the camera like the flash and delete buttons need deciphering.  Once I deleted a picture accidentally by pressing the wrong button.   It's not like a computer, where the screen asks you &quot;are you sure you want to delete this picture?&quot;  Once you press that button it is gone.

The best feature is the monitor playback.  Everybody loves to see themselves on screen in bright living color.  Another good feature is having a &quot;disk&quot; that will hold about 100 pictures.

The downside is that it eats batteries.  But I was told this is normal.

The Olympus' estimated retail price is about $399-499 but I understand that these type cameras are lowering their price.

I cannot really say I dislike the camera.  I am not a photo freak.  I think this is a good product for a family and/or someone who takes photos all the time.  You know, the shutterbug nut who has designs on being a video producer.

The camera is another little digital thingy that I have to use more to like.<br><br>
