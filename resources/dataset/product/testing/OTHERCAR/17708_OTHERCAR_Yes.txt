            I needed a practical car for a little amount of money.  I had heard about the saturns and decided to try them out.  Not only were the sales people great, friendly and not pushy, but the car was just what I was looking for.  It is the kind of car perfect for a first car owner.  The maintenance is incredible.  Just do the usual check ups and you will have no problems.  I have yet to have any problems.  I got a manual transmission and love it.  I actually enjoy driving it.  The interior is nice enough and the exterior with the plastic sidings are easy maintenance.  Getting dings are rare and the paint does not chip or fade.  I did end up putting in my own stereo system to get what I really wanted but who cares when you feel like you can afford it.  I had test driven a Ford Taurus and Geo Prism but decided that the sales people and the car were much more desirable at the saturn dealership.  Who wants to hassle with pushy sales people who are not always completely honest when you can deal with people who actually become your new found friend.  I have no debt because it was easy to pay off and I still have a great car.  It may not be a luxury car or a sports car but it gives you much more for the money.  I would recommend this car to anyone.  My car is a 94.  Imagine how much better the newer ones are!<br><br>
