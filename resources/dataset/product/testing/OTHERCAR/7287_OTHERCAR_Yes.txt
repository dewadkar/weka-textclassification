            The Olympus D460-Z provides automatic real camera features and goes a few steps beyond. If you want to just point and click; go for it. The Olympus�s auto-focus will provide you the best possible photo for any condition.  My first indication of this came when taking photos of horses at Saratoga Raceway in upstate NY.  I was amazed how using the default automatic settings gave me quality photos under different situation.

The Olympus looks like a real camera and has a nice feel to it.   You�re able to use either the viewfinder or the LCD screen to take your photo.  This is my 3rd  digital cameras and I�ve discovered the less time you use the LCD, the longer your batteries will last.

<b>Batteries</b>
It came with a set of new Olympus LB-O1 lithium batteries which seemed to last 3 times as long as the normal alkaline or rechargeable NiCd batteries. Naturally, they�re more expensive so I�m glad they were included. It was nice to have all the battery life while I learned all the features of the c

<b>Lens cap</b>
One of the best features of the camera was its sliding lens cap. This is actually, the on/off switch for the camera. When you slide it closed, the camera turns off. You can slide it open to frame your shots, and then when you�re ready, slide it just a little more and it activates the camera.  You can lose plenty of pixels with a dirty or scratched lens so this was a welcome feature.

<b>Memory</b>
This camera uses SmartMedia chips and only comes with 8MB.  I like SmartMedia even though it�s expensive. Transferring photos is done with a serial connection which is pretty slow and also sucks the batteries.  If you�re going to use the camera often,  find a SmartMedia reader that you can connect to your printer port or USB if available on your system

<b>Resolution</b>
 The Max resolution is only 1280x960 but you have a choice of three modes.  High Quality(jpg), Super HQ(jpg) and Super HQ(uncompressed TIFF) You�ll only fit 2 tiff photos on the 8MB card, but the HQ mode will give you 36. The HQ mode isn't bad quality and more than you need if you're going to put the photos on the internet. Also saves you disk space if you take a lot of photos. Use SuperHQ for portraits, if you want real detail, or you expect to edit the photos on the computer.

Olympus does offer some accessory packs that include a nice leather case, battery charger and a larger memory chip.  At HQ mode, I can take 76 photos with the 32MB card I bought but the D-460 supports up to 64MB cards.

<b>Menu</b>
The menu system was the biggest disappoint.  It required frequent trips to the manual because I had no idea what some of the initials meant and navigation wasn�t intuitive.  I had the camera siz months before I realized I had two additional quality modes that I didn�t know how to access.  Even though they were on the right side, and there is a Right button, I had to hold down the Up button for a few seconds to go to the Right. I only discovered this now while writing this review. :)

<b>Software</b>
The D-460 comes with Camedia Master software which didn�t impress me.  It lacks most of the features you�ll find on other programs.  One feature I was looking forward to allows you to switch together photo images together.  This didn�t work as well as I had hoped, Interestingly, the Olympus D-490 web site say they include version 2.0 even though the highest update available to me is 1.2.

<b>Flash</b>
The camera has all the requested flash modes, On, Off, Red-eye, Slow Sync, Auto but has one problem.  The flash has to be flipped up before you can use it.  It's ok to cover the lends but it makes no sense to protect the flash. I've wasted plenty of good potential photos because I forgot to flip up the flash.<br><br>
