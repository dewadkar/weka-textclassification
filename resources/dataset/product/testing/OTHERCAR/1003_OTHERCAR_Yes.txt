            My girlfriend and I looked and looked for that perfect car. It had to be around $20,000 and fun.  We drove the new Altimas, Maximas, Jettas, Corollas, we drove them all!!  We looked at the 2003 Civic Si as a runner up, however with 180 horsepower in XRS trim, and the Civic SI only having 160, it was a fairly easy decision. Once we drove the Matrix, which was an XR we knew then and there. The salesman was somewhat pushy, and seemed to rush us (were both teens around 20), I dont think he thought we were serious. We had to have the XRS, it had the body kit, loud exhaust, 4 wheel disc brakes and 50 more horsepower. Not to mention that 8300 redline with the cam switch that puts you in your seat at 6000. We needed it to be an auto since we do a lot of city driving in San Diego. Yet we still wanted the XRS. It was extremely hard to find. I called all dealerships within an hour and a half of here, and checked online. There were no XRS's that were auto. We were out of luck or so we thought. We went back to the dealer to try and drive the XRS since we had driven the XR the first time. What we found was awesome. It seemed that there was an elderly couple that had just traded in their 90's fullsize Buick for a 2003 Matrix XRS AUTO!! She had cutom ordered this car over 2 months ago, and had just driven it off the lot when she decided she didnt like it. She brought it back and with some begging and some extra money was put into a Solara. So now her WHITE, XRS, AUTO was up again for sale, and could not be sold as new, being already sold and driven almost 100 miles.  So we showed interest, and ended up getting it. It has the CD / AM FM/ CASSETTE, air, power windows, locks, mirrors, alarm, keyless entry, the 110v outlet the 17" alloy wheels, and side airbags. We got it for a great deal since it was considered used. They also threw in a 6 year 100,000 mile warranty, and a few other perks. The car is awesome, now has 1100 miles on it, and runs with the best of them. It handles great, seats 5 comfortably, and being the 4 cylinder, it will last forever, when properly taken care of. This isnt the fastest or nicest car out there, but it definitely makes the most sense. It can be used to haul stuff, seats 5, makes a great future family car, and yet still has the performance touch to it.  I must add that at 70 if you hold the accelerator to the floor it downshifts to second, power comes in strong at 6, shifts to third at redline, and keeps going climbing. A few last words, the car is great, despite what people say about them, you cant judge them fully until youve driven the XRS, and actually put it to the test. Oh and to the car salesman at the dealer of which we shopped, your being pushy left you out of a good commission. Even teenagers can buy new nice cars.
