            I must admit, I am a car-tart.  I move from vehicle to vehicl without a moment's thought.  One day, I just get tired of driving the same old thing, and *voila* !!!
The idea occurs to me to trade 'er in.

I was getting used to the comfort and space of coups and sedans.  I had a Dodge Avenger, which was pretty and kind of sporty.  I had my Dodge Neon, which was cute.  But then, I decided that I was getting tired of being low-to-the-ground, and also that 4-wheel drive in Montana is a neccessity.

So I moved onto the SUV.  I had a short-term monogomous relationship with one such vehicle.  I really loved my Durango, but then had an unfortunate accident with a horse.  (Don't ask.)

So...onto the pickup I moved.

This is the first time I have ever owned a pickup.  I am kind of a Dodge enthuiast.  (Not that I have any idea why, really.  I know nothing more about what's under the hood of a vehicle than I do about the Mars rover.)  They just seem to be quality vehciles, and asthetically pleasing to boot.

What I Love:
For the size of the vehcile, it gets good gas-mileage.  
It handles well, shifts smoothly, and the 4-wheel drive works great!  Living in Montana for the last ten years has given me a new appreciation for 4-wheel drive.  I've never been stuck in this truck, which is a bold statement to make when you live in a state that can snow 5 months out of the year!  Its mobility is great for summer too.  All the camping trips and hikes that require a more rugged vehcile are no problem at all with the Dakota.  
I also like that this truck is functional, but pretty too.  Its not boxy at all, and the blue paint on mine is just right.

What I Don't Like:
The seats in this truck seem to be made for someone at a very specific height.  I have trouble adjusting the seats and steering-wheel so that I'm comfortable driving.  The high backs to the seats also make a bad blind-spot for someone (such as myself) who is not tall enough to peek over.  The backseat is not very roomy.  If my 13 year old son is required to ride in the back seat, he is either complaining, or has his knees planted firmly in my back.

Overall, this is a very nice vehicle.  I would love if Dodge would make a few minor adjustments though.  (the seats and a litte more room.
