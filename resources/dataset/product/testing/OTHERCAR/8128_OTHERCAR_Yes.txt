            I've had my Stratus for 2 months now, and I love it.

I was in the market for a new vehicle, as my Neon is getting ready to retire, but I was in a dilemma--I want another Chrysler, but they don't make anything small and sporty (and under $30,000)--and I don't want another Neon.  What to do?!?

Well, I was wrong.  I knew from the first time I set my eyes on the Stratus R/T, it was the car for me.  Dodge red, sleek, and fast--at least it looks like it should be.  So I borrowed the keys from my dad (I first spotted this cool new car in his driveway) and took it for a spin...

Wow!!  The Mitsubishi-built engine and transmission are smooth as silk, and it takes off like a rocket (well, compared to a Neon, anyway).

I had some trouble at the dealerships getting exactly what I wanted--red, 5-speed manual, leather interior and a sunroof.  But I picked it up on Halloween, and I've loved it ever since.

As I said, the engine is great, and the transmission is forgiving--I shift gears because the rpm's tell me to--not because the engine's screaming and the car's jerking when I take my foot off the pedal.  It's almost like the car doesn't CARE what gear you're in--it's just happy to be going for a ride.  Either that, or it's due to the 205 foot-pounds of torque.

As long as we're talking numbers, it's got 200 hp, thanks to a 3-liter V6 (again, built by Mitsubishi).  Nice quiet engine that gets you where you need to be, and in a hurry.

The interior is nice, with comfortable seats (nice driver's side lumbar support).  The stereo has an in-dash 4 disc CD player, and the sound is great.  The trunk is huge, and has a cargo net, which is nice for groceries.  I used to put stuff in the back seat when I drove a 4-door, but now it's too tricky to get back there with a 2-door.

The only problem is that the doors have a tendency to close on you as you get out--not too convenient.

That's about it--although I just remembered another feature I really like.  When you unlock the doors with the key fob, or take the key out before you get out, the interior lights come on (and dim about 10 seconds later).  Probably a feature on a lot of cars nowadays, but one that I appreciate nonetheless.

Overall, a great car that I would recommend (especially to those with a lead foot and a tight budget!)<br><br>
