            Well, after two years researching digital cameras, and waiting for them to get to where I wanted, I bough the Nikon CoolPix 880 silver.

Digital Cameras seem to compete on what they don't have, rather than what they have.  This camera has good features, and skips some of the less important ones I think.  Some may complain about having no sound.  But why complain, don't buy this camera if you want sound.  Personally, sound is overrated in a still camera.  Buy a digital video camera if you plan on making movies.  These are not for that purpose, thus sound is unneeded I say.

First, the physical.  It's a fairly small camera, at 3mp.  The LCD is in a good place to view, and not to be in the way of your face when using the viewfinder.  Of course, this all assumes you are right handed.  There are few cameras that are well designed for lefties, or dualies.  But that's a minor issue.  The shutter release button is surrounded by the rotating on/off switch, that will not likely go on by itself.  If it does though, you will be warned because you probably have the lens cap still on.  A negative on physical is the need for an external lens cap, not a major problem, but it would be nice to see a built in one with a small camera such as this.  However, their design allows for screw-on lens adapters for wide angle, zoom, slide adapters etc.  A good feature for sure.  A good trade off.

Second, the images.  TIFF at 9mb a picture, 3.34megapix.  JPG runs below that at 1mb, 334k and 35k images approx at full size.  Like any camera, you can drop down to low res for the web or other.  Many image capture modes - single, multiple, continuous, 70/sec fast-frame, Quicktime movie.  In addition, there are many built-in custom setting for different situations: scenery, party, snow, beach, indoor, fireworks.  The flash runs in multiple modes also, on, off, redeye, auto and slow/delay.  This allows for many different settings to make the image you want in many situations.  ISO is auto-set (100-400), or like all settings, can be manually set.  The flash, unfortunately does not always activate when your scene is backlit - so you may need to force it on.

Third, image quality.  I think it's pretty good.  There have been reports of color bleeding when taking high-contrast shots such as the sky though a forest canopy.  However, I have not seen it yet.  At high quality JPG they are good enough to print out on letter size paper ( looked better than expected on a 600dpi color laser printer on plain paper) 

Finally, logistics.  The USB cable is fairly durable it seems.  The plug on the camera is behind a soft rubber door with extension-hinge like things (as is the power adapter plug)  Strangely, the video (for PAL/NTSC tv) is not covered by anything.  I don't think this camera will do so well in rain - so keep it dry.  The battery and CF are easily removed and replaced.  I purchased two batteries (rechargable) and the recharger kit.  Unfortunately, if comes with a Duracell - why bother non-rechargable unless you are far from a wall plug.  Add $100 for buying the battery and charger for this camera.

Summary.  A good overall camera with a great number of useful features.  I liked the fact it allows a 128mb CF card, and the 1gb IBM microdrives (however I don't know about power drain)  Also, the 40 second movie mode, and many other capture settings have been good to me.  Negatives are simply the long delay from pressing the button, and actually getting a photo.  I had a lot of feet thinking I took a picture when I first got it.  And trying to time a motion shot is nearly impossible with this one.  Why do most digital cameras take so long to take the picture?  Maybe soon they will have instant point-and-click cameras.  Until then, this is a good choice in my view, after looking at over a dozen alternatives.
