            I bought a used Nissan Maxima, and love it!  I have had the car for over 3 years, and have never had a major problem.  Beyond the occasional tune up, this wonderful car doesn�t require much work.  The Maxima that I own, has a V6 engine.  Needless to say, the acceleration is incredible.  You will never have problems pulling out on to a busy road.  When traveling on the highway, the car is easy to maneuver, and handles very well at high speeds.  I must say though, that the turning radius could be better.  The interior of the car is very comfortable.  The backseat passengers have plenty of legroom.  The only thing that I don�t like about the Maxima is the cruise control On/Off switch.  It is located to the left of the steering wheel, on the dashboard.  It causes the driver to take his eyes off the road, to turn on the cruise control.  Overall, this car is a dream come true.  I recommend this car to anyone.  If you are looking for a sporty car, the Maxima defiantly has the power.  Anyone would enjoy driving this car!<br><br>
