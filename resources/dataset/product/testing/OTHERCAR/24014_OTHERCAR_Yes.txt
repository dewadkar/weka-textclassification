            After I found out I was pregnant, my husband and I decided it was time to trade in our 2 door car for a more family oriented car.  We had always wanted a Lexus GS, but were afraid that we wouldn't be able to find a quality car at an affordable price.  The first dealership we went too, we found the Lexus GS300 we were destined to buy.  

I have to admit, I was very nervous about even looking at an older car with 90,000 miles on it.  As soon as I sat in the car, started it up and took it for a cruise, I was impressed with how solid and new it sounded! These cars, even with 90,000 miles on it drive like they are new! When you are sitting behind the wheel of these cars, you just feel so safe because the car is so big!  And the heated leather seats are wonderful in the winter time!  I was also pleased with the 6 disc cd changer as well!

The down side to this car was that 2 weeks after our purchase, our right caliper went out.  That cost us several hundred to fix.  And then a week later the left caliper went out, costing us another several hundred.  So, I definitely suggest looking into the records for the car and making sure the calipers have been replaced before you purchase the car!  

This vehicle is perfect for everyone from a business person all the way to a family person.  It seats 5 people comfortably, even if they are all adults!  So, if you want the look and feel of luxury, without the price tag to go along with it, I highly recommend this car!
