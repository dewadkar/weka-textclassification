            Bought our 1986 560 SEL about two years ago from a relative ... knew it's history and owner's service habits, etc.

It currently has over 250,000 miles on it and doesn't rattle or clunk, almost as good that way as most US cars on a new show room floor today.  It has had the heads and transmission rebuilt in the recent past but those are the only major repairs which have been done to my knowledge.

I get the feeling that MB has gone cheap on it's more recent offerings to stay competitive.  Too bad.  These older ones are built like battleships.

What do I like?:

It's like driving your favorite chair down the road.  The seats are wonderfully comfortable and the leather, now 14 years old, holds up well if cared for.

The ride is unbelievable, smooth and really quiet.  you can hear the radio easily at low volume levels.  

Handles really well considering the plush ride too.  I don't make a habit of jamming around curves but it does just fine.  Fairly small turn radius ... almost a u-turn in a residential street.

What a monster ... power plus.  I once worked up the nerve to find out where passing gear ends on a lonely stretch of desert highway (135 mph).  The car was perfectly stable and felt as if it was going half that speed but I will never do it again.  God only knows how fast it will go and He can keep that knowledge.  Suffice it to say that if you want to pass someone, you can do it easily.

The climate control is terrific.  The A/C and Heater click in and out and maintain the comfort level you set without further intervention from you.  You just don't notice it anymore which is about as good as it gets.

Fuel consumption is a very respectable 15 MPG or so unless you are in the mountains.  Pretty good for a 2 1/2 ton car with the power this one has.

Feels safe.  Really solid feeling car.  It has airbags in the front.  I think that it would be really difficult for anything on the outside to get at you.

It wears well.  This one has a quarter of a million miles on it and just recently (within the last 15-20,000 miles) had some engine and transmission work done.  The paint is original and, other than some jerk running a key down the side, is sound and cleans up really well.  I think maybe it has so much excess power that it just never breaks a sweat under ordinary (sane) use and thus lasts damned near forever.  For a 14 year old car, it spends a remarkably small amount of time in the shop.  Just don't let things go.

What don't I like?:

Not much.  Some parts are pretty expensive compared to domestic brands but then, they last.  Most of the stuff I've had to do to it is being done for the first time so a starter motor costs me $300 or so in parts &amp; labor, a little more than a Ford or Chevy but it'll probably be a long time before I have to do it again.  I think it evens out.

It's a bit larger than I'm used to but that probably contributes to the feeling of security I get inside it.  Again, it evens out.

All in all, as long as I can afford it, I'll never drive another car.  We liked it so well that I bought a 300 SE for my wife.  I don't know how that little 6 cylinder engine drags it down the road like it does but, although not as fast, it's almost as pleasant to drive.

Any car this age can be injured through mistreatment and/or neglect so, given the cost of repairs, a lot of care should be exercised in selecting one of these.  Especially look at the rear hydraulic suspension on the SELs as well as engine &amp; transmission.  If any of them go bad, you'll mortgage the house to fix it.  But, if you choose well, you'll love the car.
