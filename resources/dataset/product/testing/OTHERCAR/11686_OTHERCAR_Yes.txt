            My father bought this car in 1992 used. My mother had her eye on this model for a while, and we came across a maroon beauty. Our whole family fell in love with this car, and we've had it ever since.

We have put over 150,000 miles on it in the few years that we have had it, and it has never given us any problems other than the expected maintenance. My father treated this car like garbage; he never changed the oil regularly, never got tune ups, and once drove with bad shocks for months... and the car still drove like new. The paint is still immaculate even though, my dad working in a steel mill, it got covered in soot from blast furnaces almost every day. The car just seemed to ask for more.

It is an excellent family vehicle. The 2.5 liter four cylinder engine is very good on gas, and for a four cylinder has decent pick up. The interior is roomy and will seat five people comfortably, and the ride is amazingly smooth. The car is very reliable, with little or no requirement for repair other than maintenance. The engine compartment is probably my most favorite aspect of this car. Every piece of the engine is easy to get to. One can change the oil, do a tune up, and any other minor to moderate repair work with ease due to the way the engine is placed under the hood. This was the greatest relief compared to some of the other cars we've had, its saved us some money!

The only problem I have with this car is the fact that the valve cover gasket, as the car gets older, had a tendency to keep breaking. This isn't a big problem, since its easy to fix. It can be an annoyance, however.

Over all I think this is a great car for anyone to drive, especially for the student or the family. If you can lay your hands on one, buy it. It will last you hundreds of thousands of miles.
