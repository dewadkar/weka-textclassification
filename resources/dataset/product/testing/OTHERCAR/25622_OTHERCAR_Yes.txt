            My Saturn wagon came to me completely by accident. Three years ago I was out looking for a new car to replace my aging Toyota.  I was a die-hard fan of Toyota cars and had owned four in a row.  I went through Comsumer Reports with a fine tooth comb making a list of the safest and most dependable vehicles available to test drive. My list included some very high-quality vehicles and my heart was leaning toward a nice mini-van so I could cart my son and his hockey equipment around town.

I was looking around the lot at a Honda dealership and found myself wandering next door to the Saturn dealership.  Even though the Saturns were high on the safety list I have originally crossed them off because they didn't have mini-vans. The first vehicle that caught my eye was a beautiful gold wagon. It was large enough for hockey equipment, had enough headroom for my 6'2" son and felt very solid when I was behind the wheel.  Of course, I bought it!

Since then I have been amazed at how few problems I have had with my Saturn.  Just the average regular maintenance and repairs.  The car has 50,000 miles on it and will be going in for some of the major maintenance very soon just so that we can maintain the great record we have enjoyed so far.  

We moved from California to Minnesota and drove our Saturn 1800 miles to get to the new house.  Not a problem on the road.  The drive was comfortable and our Saturn handled well under many conditions, including mountain driving. The engine isn't big enough to fly up the mountain but, the car held its own on the way up.

One big advantage to owning a Saturn that I discovered after my purchase is that insurance companies charge the lowest rates for these dependable and safe vehicles. This is no small point for me since I have an 17 year old, new driver in my house.  The difference in insurance cost for him was almost $300 because he is driving a Saturn.

In the back of my mind, three years ago, I was anticipating the need for a second car before too long.  Part of my motive for purchasing the Saturn wagon was also that it would be a great car for my son to drive when he got his liscense.  Luckily, he loves the car and appreciates having all the room in the back for his friends and his junk.  Unluckily, he loves the car and it is time for me to buy myself a new car so that I don't have to walk.  First place that I am looking for my new vehicle this time is the Saturn dealership.  I already have my eye on the new SL.
