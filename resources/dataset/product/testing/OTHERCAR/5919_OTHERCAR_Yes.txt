            I own a 1996 Opel Frontera, which is the asian version of the Rodeo with a 2.2 liter 4 cylinder engine. I find it to be a rugged vehicle, but not as refined as I would like it to be. 

The design is very passenger oriented as the back passenger seats are among the roomiest in its class. The trunk compartment is also pretty spacious, since it doesn't have any flipdown seats. 

I think the suspension is very well designed for normal and highway driving. It is definately gives a firmer ride than a pajero or trooper, which makes it sportier as well.

Overall, I find it to be a tough car with no real weekness, however if you are looking for a quiet and refined vehicle, it may not be for you.<br><br>
