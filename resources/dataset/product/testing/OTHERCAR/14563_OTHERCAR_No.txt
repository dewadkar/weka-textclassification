            I ordered a this camera for a student publication I used to work with.  Although it is very versitile, if you're looking for picture quality this is not the camera you want.  At the publication, we found that this camera was very useful in taking black and white photos which don't demand alot of size, but when we wanted to use our digital camera to take color photos we found that after a professional printing process the Sony Digital Mavica MVC-FD51 didn't make the cut.  If this camera is for a person or orginization that needs to be able to take photos anywhere, this camera is useful.  Because this camera save its photos as jpegs you can use these photos on a mac or pc.  If you don't want to go through a downloading process, it disk feature will be a boon to you.  Before buying this camera, you should take a deep look at what you want your camera to do.<br><br>
