            I have recently purchased a 1994 Isuzu Rodeo with 60,000 miles on it. After the first test drive I could not imagine myself driving anything else. It was so roomy and comfortable as well as very powerful. The handling on and of the road is outstanding even without the 4*4 which I rarely use. It made me feel like the king of the road. I find it to be pretty economic on gas considering that it is an SUV. It's a great truck but I have to agree with many other people about one matter. Where is the cup holder? It's sort of difficult to control a stick shift in one hand and a steering wheel in the other as well as a cup somewhere in between. Well as long as everything else works great a cup holder is not a big deal. I would definitely recommend this truck for anyone that wants a great piece of machinery without having to spend a lot of mony for it.
