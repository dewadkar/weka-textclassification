            Back when I was in my treasured youth, I remember the Chevy Malibu as a big, ugly car with a gas hungry V8 under the hood.  Today, times have changed, and same with the style.  The Malibu has taken in some styling cues from the rest of the auto industry.  The styling isn't radical like a Ford Tarus, or as boring as a C/K series truck, but a nice combonation of round edges and twist and bends makes this car pleasing to the eye.  I currently own a 1999 Malibu LS, with 10,000 hard miles on it.  This car has done it all.  It's able to get into freeway rush hour traffic in California every day with the most of ease. It is also easy to park and has a massive list of standard features which you would pay thousands more in other cars in the same area.  The brakes in this car are decent enough, and has always stopped quickly and smoothly at sudden dangers in the road.  Handling is about par, being able to do most turns at about 35-40 mph with little tire squeal.  One note I didn't like is the length of the transmission shift knob.  It's a bit too high, and if someone is sitting in the front passenger seat and using the center consoul for a handrest, it makes it almost a fight to grab the high up shifter.  Otherwise, this car is fast, powerful, cheap, and able to break 110 mph with ease.<br><br>
