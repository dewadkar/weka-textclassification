            <b>First Impressions</b>

This epinion is not on the '93 model, but on the '88 instead.

I really love this car! I purchased my 1988 <b>Acura Integra RS</b> brand new on May 5th of '88. As I rolled out of the dealership I could not get over the odometer reading. Five miles! Since the Integra was still a fairly new model at the time (first introduced in 1986), I noticed it turned quite a few heads at stop lights. The performance was amazing to me. I'd driven many four cylinders before, but this was my first experience with a 16-valve, dual overhead cam engine. This was relatively new technology at the time. Man, this thing would scream! Red-line at 7000 rpm and revlimiter at around 7500, this engine was built to be driven hard. With a peak horsepower of 118, and peak torque at 103 ft/lbs, this was hardly a muscle car. But this vehicle only weighs 2300 lbs. So actually the horsepower to weight ratio is pretty respectable.

<b>Daily Driving</b>

This is a wonderful car for day to day city driving. The A/C and radio controls are quite ergonomical, with large push buttons that you can find easily without looking away from the road. The heat works extremely well, but I would have to take points off for the effectiveness of the A/C. It has never blown arctic air, and with this many windows it sometimes fails to cool the car sufficiently. The very large hatchback window has a defroster and a wiper blade with washer, which helps out tremendously. The standard five speed transmission works like a charm. You get a really good feel for the clutch since it is cable operated, not hydrolically operated as so many Japanese four-bangers are today. The seats are only so-so, and on trips longer than one or two hours you'll wish you took mom and dads Oldsmobile.

<b>Fun On The Track</b>

I began racing my Integra with the SCCA(Sports Car Club of America) in 1989 and learned that this car had potential! The type of racing is called Solo II and it is so much fun! You drive your car at the absolute limits through a difficult course formed with orange pylons. The times are recorded electronically down to the 1/1000th of a second! Today I am still racing 10 to 12 events per year and the car has around 700 to 1000 actual race miles on it (92,100 total miles). The engine is as strong if not stronger than the day I bought it. Since I have driven it so hard, many of the normal repairs you would expect have been necessary. Brakes, clutch, struts, timing belt, exhaust, tune ups, etc. but nothing really unexpected. It's been a great car that I would recommend to anyone who puts "fun to drive" at the top of their list.

<b>Update 4/20/02</b>

I've recently given up on the A/C since I had it repaired once, and it hasn't worked at all for 3 years. I removed the entire system from the car to save weight. All those components and hoses etc. weighed over 33 lbs.!
