            The sebring converible was my first new car, and it sure was worth the wait.  The car is very sporty and has almost every option that you can get.  The only problems that i have with the car is that i think that it could use a little more power, maybe a bigger engine or a turbo model, and it also has a small back seat.  Besides these things the car is a lot of fun in the sun.  The car handles very well in the snow and the rain, and the brakes are very good.  The top goes down with a flick of the switch and the road noise is not that loud, of course i always have the stereo on.  All in all it is a great car for the money.<br><br>
