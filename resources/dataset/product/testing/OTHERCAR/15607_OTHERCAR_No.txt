            I have been impressed with the Mavica digital cameras that I have used in the past. They have all been very easy to use with more features than you can shake a stick at. The storage medium of the 3.5 floppy is incredibly versatile, and a little easier to pallet for field use. The loss of a 3.5 disk is almost insignificant when compared to losing an 8 meg memory stick. This camera was touted as being ideal for field use. With my experience with the other models (FD-81, FD-83) I thought I would give this larger, longer range version of my tried and true previous models.
The features of this model however were not as easy to operate. Lighting, flash setup as well as light balance was a little overwhelming.
Within one month of owning the camera, the LCD display stopped functioning. This was a diferent type than the previous types in that it was not fixed but of a &quot;swinging hinged type&quot;. It is very fragile and you have to make sure it is clicked into place before being put into it's very own specially designed camera pouch (Not Included). The bulkiness of this camera was also a dettrement, for in most cases it required two hands to operate. 
All in all this was somewhat overpriced for the performance of the pictures you take. While it has the 60 second MPEG feature, it does not have a lot of the other readily available niceties like TV interface and easily accessible features such as Sepia, B+W, and others.
For field use, I recomend you go with some of Sony's lower priced but more reliable models.
