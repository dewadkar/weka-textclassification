            As most people in the market for an SUV may have found out by now is that everyone wants a Toyota 4Runner. In 1990 Toyota redesigned the 4Runner and no other SUV has compared since. I does'nt matter how old it is or how many miles it may have on it. The fact still remains is that the 4Runner is without a doubt the best SUV on the market. I have had the 90 and 91 SR5 model. Both were almost identical except for the color. 

I purchased them at different times and both were used when I got them and both had over a hundred thousand miles at the time. I never had any problems except for the starter going out around 150,000 miles. It was strange  that they both went bad about the same number of miles but other that that all I ever did was perform routine oil change's. If you're ever in the market for a used SUV spend the few extra dollars on a Toyota 4Runner. <br><br>
