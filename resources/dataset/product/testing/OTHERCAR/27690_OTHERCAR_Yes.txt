            I was specifically looking for a digital camera that also had the ability to create mpg files.  I coach little league baseball and grade school basketball and wanted the ability to 1) provide immediate feedback to kids on the form and mechanics and 2) easily (and easily is a key word here) move the jpg and mpg files from the camera to either my PC or my iMac so that I could create custom CDs for each kid on the team.  This product was a home run from that perspective!  The quality of the digital still shots is amazing, though I wish that the quality of the mpg was clearer (that might be a problem with the software that I am currently running on my PC, I'm going to try iMovie on my iMac to see if that makes it easier to view and edit mpgs).

Bottom-line: great product, though a bit pricey.<br><br>
