            We had a '85 (new),a '90(used under 1 year),Caravan Grand, and we love them. Then we decided to just try a Ford Windstar for a ride, mistake. Then we bought it for the ride and quietness big mistake.

AFTER 57,000 MILES, NO SHOP VISITS AND IT'S NOW 2002! ONE FOR maintenance but none other! The car runs PERFECTLY and I'm only on my second set of tires. NO UNUSUAL WEAR!
NO PROBLEMS with AWD--Great in Snow! I STILL LOVE IT!

With the Windstar, in three months, I lived in the shop and the car was in the shop two times each one of 7 days.!!

This Caravan is a Grand, with AWD and it is the best riding, the best driving and whether we are headed to Pittsburgh, Boston or N.Carolina, we arrive fresh and not worn out.

The car holds lots of cargo, my mother needs an electric cart, and my husband is a very handy man around the house, so we need the space.We can put a sheet of plywood, or yard sales bargains, or the cart in the car and still have room for more.

When we had two kids at home, I felt that our Caravan was part of our family,We couldn't have vacationed, or hauled all the luggage, toys, etc. without our Grand, Caravan.

We were hit twice in succession at one time by a trailer,truck in the back corner of the 90 G.Caravan, and did not suffer even a bruise!  We drove home 200 miles after the accident and there was $4000 damage. Shoulder/lap belts work!! and the G.Caravan saved us from injury.

We believe in Caravans!! We'll buy one again, when it comes time.

P.S. No one in my family works for Dodge.
