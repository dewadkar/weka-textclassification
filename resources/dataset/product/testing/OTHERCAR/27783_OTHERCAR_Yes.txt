            I have been pondering the digital camera purchase idea for almost a year now.  I sell on eBay and I have been getting my auction images by using my cheap 35mm camera, taking the film to the local drug store, waiting 3 days, picking it up and then scanning everything.  Needless to say I got tired of that routine.  I figured in time this little digital camera will pay for itself and save my sanity.

The reasons I finally decided on this camera are:

a) I was looking for something I could fit in my purse and take on vacations in my pocket.  Have seen many digital cameras in the store that seemed huge, this one is the perfect size for what I wanted.

b) wanted a brand that was well known and easy to find upgrades for.  This is Cannon which I know is easy to find.

c) Wanted the ability to have a zoom lens.  his camera came up a little short in this department but I can live with it.

d) wanted the easiest camera to computer transfer I could get my hands on.  This is really a plug and play situation with this unit.  All you do is plug the two togather, turn on the camera and it practically does the download without you!

The only short comings I have found are the high price and the wimpy zoom.  I have figured since owning it a few weeks that both are worth keeping the camera.  I read a lot of other people's reports about the lack of battery life, so far this has not been a problem for me.  Also I usually take most of my shots at low resolution so the 8 megs of storeage it comes with is fine.  Next time I take a long road trip and use this for vacation shots I may invest in a spare battery and some more memory.  Until then I am a satisfied Cannon customer!
