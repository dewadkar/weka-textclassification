            First, I'm not going to go through a litany of the features, since you can get that from Edmunds.  I'd like to talk about what it's like to live w/this vehicle.

I've now owned it for almost 2 years and figure by now if there were any defects they would have shaken loose.  I'm glad to say, nothing has shaken loose.

Second, I'm a GM fan.  We've owned many GM's and have no real complaints about any of them so we felt confident in purchasing another GM.

Third,  this car is loaded w/features at a price point well below a similarly equipped import.

Over the last couple of years, the things I appreciate about this car the most is the V6, the interior room, the trunk, and the power accessories.

The V6 has nice acceleration and isn't a gas hog either.  In fact, the mileage we get on the highway is about the same (28-33 mpg) as the 4 cylinder car that we replaced.  I suspect that this is due to the fact that the engine doesn't have to work as hard to maintain speed as the 4 cylinder.  This also translates to a quieter engine as well.  It's nice having the extra power of a V6 when trying to merge.  The engine is a fairly old GM design that's just been tweaked as much as it just about can for the most power and efficiency as possible.  This actually makes me more confident, as this means the power train is tried and true.  No fancy or new technologies with bugs to work out.  Overall, the V6 (and powertrain) delivers on it's job very well.

The interior is very comfortable, and has ample leg, head, and shoulder room.  This car is considered Mid-Sized by the EPA based on it's interior volume.  Consider that the 2002 Accord was considered a "compact".  My wife is afraid of hitting the ground (as she points out, the flying part is no problem)so we drive everywhere.  Making a 8-9 hr road trip in this car is very comfortable.

The trunk is HUGE for a car in this class.  I cannot believe how much stuff it can swallow.  I've seen full sized cars that have smaller trunks than the 'bu.  We've fit 2 full sized suitcases, a 18 qt cooler, stroller, 1 overnight suitcase, toiletry tote/bag, 2 pillows, camcorder bag, and had a little room (very little) to spare.

The power accessories have some really well thought out features.  The radio will get louder incrementally and softer incrementally based upon outside road and wind noise.  Very nice when your kid is asleep in the back seat and you pull off the highway.  No more scrambling to turn the radio down so it doesn't wake your kid up.  I also like the auto headlights.  I can't remember the last time I had to turn on the headlights (or more importantly the last time if forgot to turn them off).  The lights stay on for 20 seconds after you have taken the keys out of the ignition so you can see better as you leave to go inside (no fumbling for the front door keys in the dark).  These things are little, but when you live with a car you will be surprised at what a difference they make.

The price paid was OTD and we traded a POS 1997 Ply Neon.

Update:

I'd like to add some additional impressions about some features of the car that were not included in my original review.  Again, I will try to frame my comments in the context of living w/the car on a day to day basis.

The car has 4 wheel ABS, and even though we've never had a situation where we've needed to test the effectiveness of this feature, my impression of the brakes are that they are mediocre.  It seems that the car takes a longer lead time to come to a complete stop. I do wish to place a caveat on this comment, as my comparison of stopping distances has been shaped by the fact that we had only owned compact cars prior to the 'bu.  I'm not sure if we are just used to the shorter stopping distances inherent in smaller, lighter cars or if this has unusually long stopping distances for a car in this class.  I've heard that the front brakes are an issue w/this car (rapid wear of the pads, warping of the rotors), however I just had them checked last week by the dealer (28k miles on them) and they checked out ok. The fact that the car has front disks and rear drums would lead me to believe that you should not expect "stop on a dime" capability.

I've mentioned an Accord earlier, and that was what we test drove prior to the 'bu.  I bring this up because the handling of the 2 cars are very different, and I believe are tuned differently on purpose.  The 'bu is much softer in it's ride qualities.  It has more body roll going around hard corners, and the steering is less precise.  I find myself having to make more of an effort to keep the car centered in the lane.  I believe this is from the tuning to isolate more of the bumps and noise from the road, but this also cuts down the information being fed back to you via the steering wheel. The transmission does a good job overall as well.  My only notable observation is in hilly terrain with the cruise control on it lets too much speed bleed off then when it downshifts it accelerates pretty aggressively.  A performance sedan, this is not.  A comfortable American highway cruiser, absolutely. 

The exterior finish of the car has held up very well.  It is not garage kept (since we are sans garage).  I just washed and waxed it 2 weeks ago and it looked like the day we brought it home.  There are no rock chips on any of the leading edges of the body and we've put plenty of highway miles on the vehicle. I don't expect any paint problems from the vehicle either, as our experience w/GMs has demonstrated excellent paint quality. (our 3 1/2 yr old Neon was already showing typical Chrysler paint issues).  In fact, we've had no issues, cosmetic or mechanical, with the car at all.  However, we are dilligent about the recommended maint schedule.

Finally, I'd like to comment more on the interior ergonomics, and not just the interior space as I had earlier.  I'd like to point out a small detail one might miss, but demonstrates the kind of thinking that makes this car very nice to live with.  The transmission shifter may seem akwardly tall to look at, however when you rest your arm on the center armrest you'll find the "t-shifter" is at the same height to support your hand at the same level as the armrest. Nice attention to detail.  The ignition is on the dash, not the steering column.  This makes it easier to see when trying to insert your key.  The back seats are comfortable enough for 2 adults on long trips, but try getting 3 adults in the back and it had better be an around town trip.  I do wish the front driver seat had a lumbar support, but otherwise no complaints.  I also think the visibility is very good.  The car seems to have a taller "greenhouse" and thusly has greater outward visibility.  There is also a pair of cupholders in the rear (that are also shaped to accomodate drink boxes), as well as the obligatory pair up front.  What is different about the front cupholders is there is a single cupholder in the center console (for the passenger side) and a cupholder mounted to the left of the steering wheel that pulls out from the dash.  I like it, but a word of caution when entering or exiting the car with that cupholder extended.  Your knee could strike the cupholder itself, possibly causing damage, or upsetting the contents of the cupholder causing a spill.  Again, this car is not a high end vehicle, but for the target audience (and they know who their audience is after all they shaped the rear cupholders to be able to accomodate a drink box for goodness sake!) it's spot on.

I hope these additional details help you in your purchase decision. Thank you for taking the time to read my comments.
