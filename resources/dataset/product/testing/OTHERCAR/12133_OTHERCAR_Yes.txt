            When I went shopping for a new car, I was looking for something that said professional and classy, yet affordable.  Now that I have settled down into a decent job, I wanted a car that portrayed a mature image.  I looked at the Galants, Accords and Maximas, but they were so over-priced!!!  I could not afford to pay $25,000 and up for a mid-size car.  Then I looked at the 626, and the price was very affordable for what you get in the car.  The 2000 has a few new details, including silver chrome accents around the license plate, door handles and gear shift.  This gives the car a little bit more of that &quot;Lexus look.&quot;  I have been very satisfied with my car so far, and my parents have had 2 626's which ran perfectly for years.  They still have a '91 that is going strong.  The trunk is very large and there is ample room for 4 people to sit comfortably in the car.  I find that the new styling of the 2000 version is very sleek and a little bit different than most other midsize cars.  This car gives great bang for the buck.  I bought mine loaded for just under 20,000.  If you are looking for a new mid-size car, give this one a test drive and you will not be disappointed!<br><br>
