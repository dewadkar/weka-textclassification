                 Quiet, lush, fast, and did I mention QUIET is what the makers of the 2000 Jeep Cherokee must have been thinking when developing this vehicle.  The theory with the new and upcoming SUV's is that people want to go anywhere, any time, any conditions, and still look good and be comfortable doing it.  
     Well, if that is the theory then Jeep can look forward to alot of Grand Cherokees being sold.  Which is reality!!!  You see more Grand Cherokees on the road than any other vehicle.  This vehicle handles great in town as well as in harsh conditions, especially in the snow, and the best part aside from the price is a great looking vehicle.  
     The car-like frame adds alot of comfort driving in the city and its unique suspension is great on tuff terrain.  In the V6 model the acceleration is modest, but nothing to get excited about.  The V8 5.7 litre is strongly recommended if you like a little more zip.  My family owns a 2000 Jeep grand cherokee, a 1999 Land Rover Discovery, and a 1999 BMW 740iL so the diversity leads to a little different opinion.  Even though it does not handle as well as the Discovery off-road, it is considerable nicer to drive in city limits.  Making the Jeep Grand Cherokee much more compatible with someone who needs a SUV for space, safety, or height rather than extreme off-roading conditions.
     So unless your the avid mountain climber this SUV can handle every part of your need and more.  Great car and you get alot for the money.  
     Good luck and GO BUCS!<br><br>
