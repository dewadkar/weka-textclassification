                 I got my 1991 Prelude in 1995 used.  It had just a hair over 20K miles on it.  I have since put almost 50,000 miles on it in the past 5 years.  I'm into performance, so I have modified the car with a myriad of after-market performance parts.  It has an air intake and filter, An exhaust system, and performance headers.  If there is one complaint I have with the car, it's that it feels too heavy for the original 150hp that Honda gave it.  If it had closer to 250hp it would be the perfect sports car.  A point of accomplishment on these Preludes would be the handling.  I've owned, (and still own,) many different sports cars, and this little 'Lude can keep up with the best of 'em.  I upgraded the suspension, to the fullest extent possible, which has made a good handling car even greater.  I originally got the car for about $9,000, and have since put about $5,000 into it.  Not bad considering you can buy a Porsche for $80,000, or a Lotus for $100,000 and gain similar handling.  Next on my &quot;to-do&quot; list would be to swap out the engine for a newer Prelude VTEC, or maybe add a turbo.  I want to keep this car forever, and the way it runs, I can.  I live in Hawaii, with its fluctuating climate.  The car has held up perfectly, with regular up-keep being the only real cost.  The light switch broke once,  although this was probably my fault, but a new one was cheap and easy to replace.  The engine is a 2.1L which is one thing that separates the '90-'91 from the '88-'89.  The older 3rd generations, the '88-'89, had a 2.0L.  The '90-'91 also have a more polished trim on the body.  Although they share the same basic body the '90-'91 has cleaner bumpers and moldings, as well as sexy white and red tail lights.
     Driving the car is awesome.  It's like a true sports car feeling.  Everything is where it needs to be.  The throttle is crisp, if not deep (oohhh for more power...)and the brakes have good fade resistance,(initial bite could be improved, by putting braided lines)  DO NOT expect to put anything other than a SMALL bag in the back seat, it's laughably tiny, and even children would have a hard time sitting anyway but sideways.  But then, if you need a back seat, go buy one of those gas guzzling SUV's.  The trunk, however is large and easy to use.  My car is an Auto, with the sport-shift.  It is fluid and smooth in normal mode, but holds the rev's to redline in sport mode, and slams the shifts a little hard, perhaps this is a good thing.  I've driven the 5-speeds before, and would recommend that over the auto, just for the feel of driving the 5-speed gives.
     If your looking to buy a 3rd Generation Prelude, I have some suggestions:

* Look for a 1990 or 1991-for the bigger engine and body
* The 2 most sought-for options are anti-lock brakes and the 
  all-wheel-steering.  If you have never driven a AWS car, try it
  first, as it improves handling but some people say the car feels
  as if it's losing control.
* Get the 5-speed.  Not that there is anything wrong with the auto,
  but the 5-speed is sooooo sweet.
* Even base cars have decent features, but a fully loaded car
  has: AC, PL, PW, Leather(real hard to find), Tilt Wheel, 
  Power moon-roof, Foglights, Alloy wheels, AWS/ALB, 
  CD, and more.
* Check the AC. My AC has been struggling since about 50K.  But then I   
  live in Hawaii.
* Your first upgrade: Bigger wheels/grippier tires, lowering springs.
* Consider adding power to the anemic engine.
* Blue Book is currently around $8,000 for a excellent example-
  A real steal!!!
