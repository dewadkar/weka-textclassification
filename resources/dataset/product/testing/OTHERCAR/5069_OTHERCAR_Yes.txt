            I purchased this camera from Sears back in October of 2002.  Someone had taken it back to get a better camera and I'm the lucky one that found it for a low price of $230.

This is a fun camera to use and you'll be really impressed with the battery life.  It may not be the best and strongest around, but it suits me well.  I use my camera often and I can go about a week without putting the battery on the charger.

I do wish that I could fit a bit more pictures on a floppy, though. I leave the picture mode on "Fine" to get a little (and I do mean little) more picture quality.  You have to be careful when removing/inserting the battery into the bottom of the camera or you might break off the little door which I'm scared of doing.  It hasn't happened yet, but I suppose I should knock on wood.

The flash is great and performs well, but when there's a bright light in the room/area you're in when you're taking a picture, and you use the flash, it tends to distort the picture and makes it dark.

When using fine mode, be sure to take a bunch of floppy disks if you plan on taking a good bit of pictures.  I've often found myself running out of room, because you can only fit about 10 pictures on a disk when using Fine.
