            I bought my 1994 Nissan Maxima because I currently owned a 1987 Nissan Maxima and found these vehicles to be wonderfully reliable and with all the options I liked.  I decided to treat myself to a newer vehicle for my birthday.  

The car is blue which I didn't think I'd like at first but it grew on me.  The interior of the car is very roomy and it has a great amount of trunk storage space.  I had back surgery last year and this car was so comfortable and easy to get in and out of.  The V6 engine was a huge plus.  I loved the all power options and sunroof.  The vehicle handled really well and was very comfortable to ride in.

This is a great car for families and business people alike.

There are a few negatives to this car just like any other car.  In the 4 years I've owned the car, I've replaced 4 of the 4 window regulators for the power windows.  That's $200 each.  The other problem I've run into deals with the brakes.  They squeak and that's putting it mildly.  I've had them checked and rechecked and the company I went to said it's just a normal thing that happens to this model of car.  My brakes are fine, but what an embarrassment to drive and come to a stop and hear that squealing!  I finally purchased more expensive brake shoes on my own and it seems to have helped so far.

One of my favorite fluff features is the window defroster on the side-view mirrors.
