            For the money, you&#146re not going to get a better luxury/performance car. I was looking at used 300ms, 3 series BMWs and Lincoln LS'. For the money, this car had them all beat hands down. Again, I was looking for used vehicles.  That's what I prefer. Autos with under 20k mileage.  I bought my 02 GLE at the used car section of a Ford Dealership, go figure.  The car had 10k miles and still had that new car smell.  The person that owned it before me kept it in beautiful condition.

I love this car.  Once I test-drove it the search was over.  It was just a matter of coming to terms with the sales rep and his manager on $$. 

Like I said, I bought the GLE model and it has everything except the navigation system.  This model even came equipped with a DVD system for the rear seats.  Coming from the Ford dealership, they couldn&#146t tell me if this was an aftermarket feature. Nonetheless, it's nice to have.

The lines on the car are designed quite nicely for an entry-level luxury sedan. The front Xenon lights are a nice touch.  However, I think they could of worked more on the back end design.  

The ride is smooth and engine noise almost non-existent. This is not a soft ride at all. The suspension is tight, but works well with the performance of the car.  The major complaint I have is the turning radius.  Makes U turns challenging.  The minor complaint is the front wheel drive.  As in most front wheel drive cars it feels heavy and tad bulky.  But, seems to handle it ok.

The interior has just as many toys or more than cars that cost considerably more.  Driving in California, I don't necessarily need the heated seats or steering wheel.  However, the power memory seats are great addition and the in dash 6 disc CD player is a nice complement.  My wife drives a BMW 330I, which she prefers because of the smaller fit (she's 5'1").  She tells me that she drives this car with no problems at all and enjoys the ride almost as much as her BMW.  Again, for the money, I'll drive the Maxima.
