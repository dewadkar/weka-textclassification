            I think pictures give us the ability to capture an instance in time and preserve it in our reminiscent memories. I can't begin to add up all of the wonderful pictures my family and I have taken over the past few years, some remembered and likewise forgotten. 

In efforts to make a long story short I have one thing that I want to say. What is a picture if you can't clearly make out what is being viewed let alone being able to remember the event. That's why I feel high picture quality and resolution is a must when trying to preserve an fragment of time. If it is a birthday party, first tooth pulled or lost, waking up on a rainy day with hair strewn about your head, having a delightful family outing, a personal moment with your significant other or any other many special times that may come to mind, you want the ability to capture that event in all its pristine glory.

The RCA CDS1005 is not the best tool for high resolution pictures. Its low 0.3 megapixel resolution is further crippled by its fixed lens with no focusing capabilities. This is one of the most important features to look for in a camera digital or other wise. However, it does possess the ability to interface very easily with peripherals for transferring images.

It seems to be fairly durable also thanks to its high impact plastic casing and rigid construction. I also enjoy not having to load any film, what a hassle in some of the older 35mm cameras. RCA makes other great electronic products but this one falls a little short in overall picture quality. That is compensated a little with decent battery life, ease of use, excellent interfacing, and durable construction.

I really don't think the novice user will think to highly of this product but some beginners might want to give it a gander. Like I said before the resolution is not the best but what do you expect for around $80.
