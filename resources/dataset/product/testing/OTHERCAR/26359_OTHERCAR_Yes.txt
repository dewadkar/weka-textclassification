            When we added a 1999 GMC 2 Dr. Jimmy to our driving lineup, it marked the third Jimmy we have purchased.  This one differs from the other two in that it is a 2WD, whereas the other two were 4WD, but this decision was based more on the fact that we now live in town, on paved roads, rather than in the backwoods of Michigan!

As with our previous Jimmies (one of which we still own, with nearly 100,000 miles on it!) this one is a good, solid driving machine.  We opted for the more plush suspension on this version, which means that when you are inside the cab you have the feeling that you are riding in a car, rather than a truck.  This version also sports the cloth seats rather than the leather we had gotten before, in the Texas sun, we find the cloth much cooler. The cockpit is streamlined, everything in plain easy view, and nicely appointed with wood-colored trim. The seats are comfortable, although since this is the 2 DR version, getting into and out of the back seat is still a trick best left to those who are either very small, or double jointed.  They have added a split to the back seat which is a nice plus, it allows you to fold down just half of the seat, rather than the full seat, so that if you have 3 passengers and some cargo, no one has to ride double.

On average, we get between 20-25 MPG with this version, and high way driving is a pleasure.  In a recent &quot;fender bender&quot;, it proved out the bumper system when our car had a few scratches on the bumper, and the Ford Explorer in front of us had a major dent in the rear door ($1200+ worth of damage to the Explorer).

Over-all, we have been very happy with the car as with all our GMC products!  The only &quot;flaw&quot; that we have found in this version is that for some reason it has a longer turning radius than our past versions, which were made prior to the body style change.  Whereas our 1993 Jimmy can &quot;turn on a dime&quot;, this 1999 version needs much more room to make an arc.  I don't know if this is due to re-engineering the mechanics in the front end in some way, or if the front wheels are perhaps set back from the front more on one than the other.  Otherwise, it has the same power, get up and go and &quot;go anywhere&quot; ability that we have always found in this product, with the exception that it isn't 4WD so the deep mud is off limits with it!  

Just a small note here--we had two 1993 Jimmies--both 4WD--and still have the one...we would still have the other except that someone stole it from the parking lot of our son's apartment complex--a &quot;secure&quot; community with a parking lot full of Lexus, Mercedes, Corvettes, etc., which says something about the Jimmy, when they choose to steal a Michigan rusted, 1993 Jimmy over a modern, luxury car!  We never considered replacing it with another brand.

Only con--insurance on them is still high---<br><br>
