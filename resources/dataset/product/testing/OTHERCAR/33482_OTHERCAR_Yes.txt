            I got my 91 cavalier from my father junior year in high school.  It is a manual shift and nothing power.  However, it is still a great car.  Excellent for the college student who is looking for something cheap and affordable.  

My car is nearing 150,000 miles and is holding up well.  Considering how a high school male drives and living near the beltway, there is tremendous stress on the car, but it still holds up great.  I don't really have any problems with the car, if you are looking for something sporty the car doesn't handle real well, by I'm surprising still happy with the speed, maybe bc it's a manual.  

Driving the car is fine, no real problems, a little bit of noise other than the engine, a little rattle of the intererior or something, but nothing much...can't notice it if you have the radio on.  Also, upgrading is not a problem at all, my father put a recaro seat in it bc he has a bad back. 

 I put in a Kenwood stereo and new speakers all the way around from crutchfield, back six by nines provided decent bass, but distorted at high levels.  No real problems with it and my next future car will hopefully a new z24, if the college funds aren't too depressing.<br><br>
