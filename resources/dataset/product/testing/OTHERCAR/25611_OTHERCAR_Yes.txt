            Since the Spring of 1999, I have been a proud owner of the Saab 9-3 convertible.  This reliable, sporty, and good looking car is perfect for a fun car for a single man or woman or even for a fun car for the family.  The Saab 9-3 has great steering unlike some other models such as the Ford Mustang Convertible which has very shaky steering.  The pickup from 0-60 is not especially great, but when driving around 20 mph...the pickup to 60 or 70 is incredible.  Among the many convertibles on the market, the Saab 9-3 has a great convertible top that is easily stored and the mechanism that closes it is fast and efficient.  After owning this car for over a year now (6/12/00), I have nothing but good things tom talk about it.  If you are looking for a fun car that you can rely on, the Saab 9-3 is for you.<br><br>
