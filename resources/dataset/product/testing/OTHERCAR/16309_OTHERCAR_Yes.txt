            Recently my wife and I decided that we needed a digital camera.  We already have a decent Olympus Stylus for "real" shots, so we were not looking to replace our film camera and go totally digital.  We sell a lot of items on eBay, and we send a lot of scanned images via e-mail to stay in touch with our relatives in Europe.  Unfortunately, developing and then scanning pictures can be time consuming and costly.  

Our previous foray into the digital camera realm using an Agfa eSmile was a disaster, so this time we really did our homework.  We did not want to spend over $200 on a digital camera when we have a perfectly viable and portable Olympus Stylus at home.  Plus, neither my wife and I are super photographers.  After much deliberation (and a big sale at CompUSA) we gravitated towards the Hewlett Packard C200.  

I was lucky in that I snagged the last Hewlett Packard C200 that day at CompUSA on Thanksgiving weekend.  At first I was a bit dismayed by it's large size when compared to it's sleeker, more modern (and expensive) counterparts.  But at the price I paid ($145), for a 1-megapixel camera I was not complaining.

After loading up the 4-AA batteries that it requires I quickly got the hang of taking simple snapshots.  While the Hewlett Packard C200 does come with more advanced features that I will leave to others to explain - I am basically a point-and-shoot type of guy.  It does have a handy LCD screen on the back that is useful for checking your shots, but be warned - prolonged use will eat up your batteries.  Another nice feature is that you can select the image quality; obviously the higher quality, the more space the images take up on the CompactFlash memory card.  Speaking of which: the Hewlett Packard C200 ships with an 8MB CompactFlash memory card which is sufficient for the average user.  It is nice if you already have equipment that uses this media format, as the cards, regardless of size, will be compatible.  Another nice feature is that the lens has a sliding cover - protection is nice.  Overall, the Hewlett Packard C200 is solidly built.  

The images that the Hewlett Packard C200 produced were better than I expected.  The colours were vibrant and the details were clear.  The software that it shipped with was fairly easy to use, but for some reason it kept locking up on my wife's computer.  We printed out several snapshots onto HP photo paper (using an older HP 812C printer) and they came out great - you would be hard pressed to prove that they were not taken with regular film camera.

One of the things that I did not like about the Hewlett Packard C200 were that it did not come with a USB option.  The image transfer using the serial adapter is slooooow, and if you do not have rechargable batteries or an A/C adapter (an expensive add-on that did not come with the camera) you will be eating up batteries in no time at all.  My suggestion is to purchase a card reader.  That way you can just take the card from the Hewlett Packard C200, pop it into your computer and transfer the images much more quickly, without draining your batteries.

While the Hewlett Packard C200 is much to slow for take pictures at sporting events (I tried at a Pittsburgh Penguins game with terrible results), it is more than adequate for casual snapshots, and ideal for those that need to take pictures of their goods for online vending.
