            I bought this car this past fall for my wife as she wanted something &quot;different&quot;.While this is a fun car to drive and it really stands out in a crowd,It is not for everyone .The convertible top is way over complicated and somewhat quirky.The hi tech electronics are really something to behold but can be complicated to understand without a factory service manual and very expensive to repair.While I have heard reports of troublesome brake problems with the Allante,I have not experienced any to date. Parts are becoming hard to acquire and can become pretty expensive.Even with all that, it is a pleasure to drive with the top down on a warm fall day.These come factory equipped with about every luxury gadget you could want.The interior is quite comfortable for two adults and  has a more than adequate trunk for a rag top .Membership in a club or Appreciation group is recommended.  <br><br>
