            Before you think of purchasing this car, keep in mind, there is no power whatsoever, so if you are running late, you will be definitely not make it in time.  Do not get me wrong, it is a very nice, affordable car, and will last a life time, but it lacks in a few small areas.  

The Duster does receive excellent gas mileage, and will never break down, or at least after several years ours has not.  I have not had any problems or complaints towards the manufacturers at all.  The Duster runs fine on the highway and city, and has cruise control to make your driving that much easier.  There is also an enormous amount of space, and probably enough to fit at least five and maybe even six people comfortably with the large area of leg room in the back.  This car would be great for a larger than normal sized family, in people that is.  There is not much to say when speaking of the inside.  Yes, there is air conditioning and of course a glove box, but where are all of those unique options other cars have that make a car more appealing to the eye.  For example, there are no power windows, nor are there power locks.  As Plymouth lacks these few simple options, it becomes more of a pain to drive the car.  As far as the stereo goes, the quality is extremely poor.  The Walmart muzak can push more watts than the speakers of this car can even come close to handling.  The speakers on our car blew out about a year after we bought it.  

Aside from a few changes they should have made in the beginning, the car overall is almost perfect.  It has decent looks, runs at a cheap price, and most importantly, will not give you much, if any trouble.  The Duster would be a great first car for a teenager, and ideal for a family of four or five.  I would recommend you give this car a look if you are looking for a cheap, stable car.<br><br>
