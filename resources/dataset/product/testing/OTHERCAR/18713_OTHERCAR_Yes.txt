               <b>U</b>nashamedly based on the Dodge Dakota truck, the 2002 Dodge Durango SUV combines the best of 2 worlds; truck like strength and size, and car like comfort, ride, and relatively good handling.

     Although being based on the Dakota Truck, the Durango does everything many multi purpose-built SUV's do, and it does a few things even better. This year the Durango comes in 3 models, the Sport, the SLT, and the SLT Plus. There's feel and accuracy in the steering, plus balanced and a surprisingly comfortable ride. Add this to the optional 245 horsepower 5.9 SOHC V8 and you get excellent acceleration, which sees you hitting 60 mph in around 8.8 seconds (according to specs).


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 


With the 245 HP powered SOHC 5.9 liter V8 <b>acceleration</b> is very good, especially for the curb weight of this vehicle. On take-off one will appreciate the strong surge of power that does not quite. I might sound a little greedy here, but I personally feel this particular engine should have been left for the Dodge Dakota R/T, a more portent DOHC design would have been welcomed for more hill climbing power while on steep hills and further the Durango's exclusivity. Ground clearance is good, which makes the Durango very practical off road, however in 2WD form you might not want to get yourself too far in the rough. The appeal of the Durango is obvious, it's sexy, bold, and comes in a value priced package. All three models come with 4-speed automatic transmissions, and all engines are available for most models, although somewhat ironically the 'Sport' trim line does not come with the 5.9 liter option.  

       <b>The engine</b> of choice is the 5.9 liter. This is a very heavy vehicle, so all of its 335 lb-ft of torque is needed to move this 'Super sport UTE'. The 5.9 is a Magnum V8 used in the Dodge Ram as well as older versions of the Dodge Dakota. It has traditional cast-iron block and heads, plus the usual two valves per cylinder operated by single V- mounted camshafts, and hydraulic valves lifters. The other engine (base engine, is a SOHC 4.7 liter V8 engine that produces 235 horse power and 295lb-ft of torque(the 5.2 liter V8, and the 3.9 liter V6 options are gone for the 2002 model year). With the 5.9 liter engine the Durango can tow a trailer over 4,000lbs.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

   The <b>interior</b> of the 2002 SLT 2WD Durango is quite luxurious, especially for a vehicle that is advertised for utility vs luxury. A cold AC, power everything, power seats, CC, Single Cd player, and power mirrors are standard. The Dodge Durango has one of the largest interiors in its class, with seating for up to 8 adults! The interior is modern, yet not too modern; there are no chrome accents, or nifty onboard navigation systems; fine with me, titanium accents are not my cup of tea. Ergonomics are excellent, allowing the driver to easily reach the auto shifter and all the controls. There is plenty of room in the center console for CD's etc, and tons of storage room in the rear. The rear seats fold down to furthering stowage. The front seats are comfortable, and offer good lateral support. The drivers position is also good which allows for easy driving, and very good outward vision.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

   The <b>exterior</b> is one of the most striking SUV's in its class for this model year. Since introduction in 1997 the Durango has boasted one of the most bold looking exterior's, and has paved the way for other companies who don't want their SUVs to get lost in traffic with Mrs. Plain Jane looks. The Durango is equipped with a bold front grille fascia, flush mounted headlamps, sleek, yet muscular curves, fog lights, and roof rack. Some of the safety features include, driver and side airbags (standard), and side air bags which are optional. Daytime running lights are optional, and child safety locks are standard. Rear ABS is also standard. www.dodge.com has a complete list of optional and standard equipment. 

     The <b>Price</b> for the Durango 2 WD starts out at around $24,000, but fully loaded can set you back in the 30,000 dollar range. With the 4-wheel drive option on the SLT Plus can run you as high as $35,000. 


<i>Conclusion:</i>

If you are looking for an 'on-road' sport utility vehicle, but don't want to break the bank, the Dodge Durango offers an excellent value. The Durango not only offers SUV like characteristics, it offers excellent performance and luxury to boot.
