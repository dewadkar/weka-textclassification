            I traded in my 96 Dodge Dakota for a new 2001 Tacoma 4x4 extra cab SR5 when I decided I needed a smaller, but 4x4 PU truck. Researched allot and test drove a few brands. I liked the overall performance of the 2.7L 5 sd Tacoma best. Peppy, lots of ground clearence, stiff responsive handling yet still delivered 21 mpg. Kind of a cross between a sports car and a mini PU. ( It was the smallest of the mini PU's a well.) This performance and TOYOTAs reputation for quality sold me on the Tacoma despite the fact that it was going to cost thousands more than the Ranger, S10 or Dakota. Within days of purchase the truck developed it's first knock/rattle. 12-14 months latter, it had developed pronounced interior squeaks& creaks, popping moldings and a rattling drive train. 13 days at the dealer this summer alone (and intervention by the Toyota rep) has left most of the problems unresolved. Nothing critical but unaceptable on a new $22,000 truck!. Heck,The 6 year old Dodge I traded in was tighter! Other gripes: inadaquate heating /AC,access to the rear cab from the drivers side requires manual resetting of the seat each time, interior VERY small with a lack of storage space. It also breaks out from under you easily in just a little snow. ( Even with weight of the cap. Could be the junk factory 265 tires).No doubt the engine will last a lifetime but I'll unload this one as soon as I can afford to. That could be a while, despite meticulous care, it's already depreciated about $7.5K in trade in value over 20 months. That's as much as the Dakota dropped in 6 years.
