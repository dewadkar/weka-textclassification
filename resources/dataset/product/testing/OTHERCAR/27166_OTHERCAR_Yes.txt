            My sister owns this car, so I get to ride in her Passat now and again (yippee), so if you're considering this vehicle, let me tell you about the outsider's perspective.

I bring up Blaupunkt, because if you know anything of a German-make, you'd be familiar with and very impressed by the quality of the product.

The Passat is no exception.  We're talking:
Precision manufacturing.  This car is practically hand-made (I should really ask if it is!).  The fittings of the doors, the gears, each button, each switch, solid in design.  No gaps. 

Lush bucket seats.  Prime comfort.  Her interior was not leather, but it was a suede-look-a-like, and let me tell you, I was impressed.  Very luxurious and very sharp.

Smooth handling, quick pick-up.  What an engine.  I don't know the specifics, but this thing is as zippy as a sports car, but it handles like a luxury car.  Very smooth.  No wind noise.

Excellent sound system.  Veeerrry impressive.  Need I say more?

Wow paint job.  High gloss.  Hers is a light-aqua color (I can't think of the name right now) and it has this awesome sheen.  Very nice.  Doors that bump on hers?  *Their* paint comes off.  Not a scratch on hers.

Awesome driver's panel.  Stuff *glows* blue.  It's not just illuminated by a lamp.  Easy on the eyes.

And of course, the sound:  purrs like a kitten, and I just love the &quot;thump&quot; of the doors.  Very, very solid (my favorite word here).

And some notables:  My sister bought this car after doing extensive shopping.  The Passat came with the most features (specifically safety features) for her money.   

(Look into the air bags when you're considering this car.  I think they're on all four doors -- or the sides of the drivers and passengers seats.)
