            As an owner of a 2000 2-Door Chevy Blazer, I strongly recommend considering this vehicle.  Not only is it stylish, but it is heavy duty for the rugged side of all us guys.  It rides smooth, and so far I have had absolutely no problems with it.  The 2-door Blazers feature a powerful V-6 Vortec engine with quite a bit of towing capacity.  It comes standard with Driver's and passenger's side airbags.  Many smaller features such as CD player, automatic volume control, and automatic headlights are also included.  If you are looking for leg room, the Blazer has it.  Chevrolet has been in the business for a very long time, and you really can't beat the dependability.  Blazers have a 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty, with the option to buy an extended warranty good anytime before the standard warranty expires.  As for the price, you really can't beat it.  A 2-door Blazer is very reasonably priced at anywhere from $21-$24,000.  Go check it out and see for yourself.  I don't think you will be disappointed.   <br><br>
