            I had a Kia Sportage a few years ago and I absolutely loved it!  It would go where-ever I wanted or needed to go.  It was roomy enough for me to move around in and it had almost as much cargo space as it did passenger space.  The only problem that I found with it was that it had a problem with running as far and long as I would take it on some days.  It wasn't very fast but it handled very good on snow and ice.  I took it four wheeling a couple of times and didn't get stuck or anything.  It was a very comfortable car to drive, everything was within reach of the driver and easy to understand.  It was roomy enough that I didn't get all cramped up driving 600 miles or more, and didn't have to rent a trailer when I moved.  It is a fairly good all around type of vehicle, family(four door), or sporty(two-door).  <br><br>
