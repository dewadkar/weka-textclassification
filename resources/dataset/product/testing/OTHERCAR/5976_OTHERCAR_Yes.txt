            Volvo wasn't just another car in my family, I never drove a luxury car and even though 240 is not all that luxurious and it is a bread-and-butter car from Volvo, you have to drive it once to feel safe and confident.

Volvo cars are famous for safety and they are the safest cars in the world, just the idea that you provide yourself with the best protection you can get makes you feel safe.  In 240 you feel like you are in a tank, it's heavy, durable and capable of moving people.  

It is not a performance car, it wasn't built to be a performance car neither does it look as a performance car.  My 2.3L 114 hp engine could move 6 people or tow just about anything but I wouldn't race with Honda or VW in that Volvo.  

The interior is plush and not very comfy, my interior is dark blue and is kind of boring, shape of the body of the car is boxy and old, it originates as far back as 1966, with some minor changes Volvo kept making these boxes for almost 30 years now.

Resale value is surprisingly high, 1990 Volvo with 100,000 miles can be found for $10,000, what's the point?  Well, Volvos run longer than probable any Korean or American cars with about 250,000-300,000 miles until it drops.  They really run forever and that's another reason to buy Volvo, reliability is great!

Keep in mind that if you ever have to replace parts it always costs more, even more than Japanese makes.  Volvo parts are harder to get and are expensive, however they are easier to work on.<br><br>
