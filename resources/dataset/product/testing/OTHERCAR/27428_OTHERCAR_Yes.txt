            I bought this car used so I wasn't really expecting much the people wanted $2500 and I was able to talk them down to $1500 so when I left there yard with it I was doing pretty good. It was running really good for the first couple of weeks and then it just died. I had plenty of gas in it at the time so I could not figure out why the car came to a dead stop. I called my dad for his assistance we towed it back to my house in the country and started to trace out the problem we found that it was not getting gas so we had to trace the line because the owners manual does not tell you where the fuel filter is located. We traced the line all the way to the back of the car under a metal plate by the gas tank is where the fuel filter is so we got it off of there and changed it. It was what was causing my problem, the replacement part was thirty bucks. So it was worth it to have the car back up and running again. For the next few weeks the car was running great, I carelessly let the car get low on fuel one day and it died again, I thought at least a light would come on but nothing. So I pushed it to the side of the road and went and got gas for the car. I put some in and made it to the gas station and filled it up. After that the car started running really rough it was spurting and not getting any speed and now the engine light had come on and every day it got worse and worse. So once again I brought it to my dads attention he figured I had dirtied the filter again but then he went on the web to do a little studying about the car. He found out if you turn the key three times quickly the car will give you a code and tell you what's wrong with it. Well it was throwing a few  different codes at us so we were not quite sure what it was we started with the spark plugs they all seemed to be firing good but one of the was pretty beat so we changed that hoping it would be that nope. We ended up checking out the fuel injectors we found out that they were $150 dollars a piece and there is four of them and you need to replace all four and we are penny pinchers so this was going to be our last option. I tried a bottle of Gumout fuel injector cleaner. This didn't work either the situation was becoming a desperate one because I need this car to get back and forth to work. So my dad removed the fuel injectors and found that the fourth one where the spark plug was firing badly was filled with rust and junk so he cleaned them all up with WD-40 and wrapped them with teflon tape because there were no o-rings where they are supposed to be. We went to the Dodge dealership they told us ten bucks for two o-rings and you need four sets that's why we wrapped it with teflon. The car is running excellent now and the engine light went off it has a lot more pep, and if you go to Napa they have the same o-rings for about seventy cents a piece figures.
