            I bought a 1997 5.28 i and I find every excuse in the world to drive it.  It handles like a gem and has great pick-up.  Very quiet ride.  Many a time I have glanced down at the speedometer and been shocked at how fast I was going.  Very luxurious.  You can control everything but the A/C from the steering wheel.  Great sound system.  Good gas mileage.  Get about 400 miles to a tank on the freeway. Great A/C.  I live in Texas and it can get pretty hot down here.  The A/C kicks in automatically.  Has dual control and it really works.  The BMW service that I have received has been excellent.  My salesperson was great to work with.  He has been very accommodating.  
Plenty of trunk room.  Enough room to fit three bags of golf clubs.

My roommate has a Mercedes CLK and we both agree that my car is a much nicer car than his.  More room in mine and a little bit more luxurious.  Very good deal for the amount of miles on it (31,000 miles).  Still got a two year full warranty.   

I would recommend this car to anyone who is in search of a fun ride.  <br><br>
