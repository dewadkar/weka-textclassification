            I treat my '88 Sentra like garbage, and it treats me like gold.  That's why I love this car so much!  My '88 is a four speed, standard transmission with absolutely NO options (not even a cigarette lighter).  As bad as this may sound, I am still incredibly impressed with the vehicle.  First, let's start with the problems I've had with it:  Some surface rust, replaced 2 motor mounts, replaced clutch, replaced right lower control arm, replaced alternator.  Okay, so that sounds like quite a bit, but all the repairs were extremely affordable, and keep in mind the fact that this car is 12 years old with 175,000 miles on it and it is on its 3rd teenager.  Some of the things I like best about this car:  that as small as it is, it is extremely roomy inside for a car this size (even in the back seat), it has plenty of power for acceleration, gets GREAT mileage, it's reliable, and has never failed a VA emissions inspection.  Most of all, my favorite thing about this car has to be the engine.  I cannot believe how well this car runs after all I've put it through.  I now have a problem with the valve cover gasket which causes me to loose a quart of oil every tank of gas, and being the lazy guy that I am I have run the oil pan dry probably 10 or 15 times.  Regardless, the engine has NEVER given me any problems and continues to run like a champ!  If my old '88 Nissan Sentra has treated me this well, I'd absolutely love to see how the new ones run.<br><br>
