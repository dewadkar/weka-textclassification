            The Saab 9-3, virtually the same car as the old 900, remains as impressive, sporty, and luxurious as it always has been.  Even though the model is somewhat dated at this point, it remains a completely viable and thoroughly driveable car, one that competes favorably with the best in its class.

The interior is decked out very nicely, with typical Saab quirkiness.  The famous center console ignition is present.  The leather seats cradle you wonderfully, and the heated seats are certainly refreshing on cold winter nights.  The controls are completely intuitive and well-thought out, and include such friendly touches as steering wheel audio controls.  The interior is spacious, and extremely comfortable even on long trips.  The back seat is roomy enough for adults (I'm 6'6&quot; and I fit in the back), though three adults may be a bit of a stretch.

The car drives like a charm.  It would be wise to choose the manual transmission over the automatic, as the manual is easy to shift, very precise, and appreciably improves performance in the car.  The turbo helps this car very much.  The 185-hp engine is more than adequate, and it continues to be a wonder how Saab engineers continue to churn out 4-cylinder engines like this one without making the cars susceptible to massive bouts of torque steer.  The handling is truly impressive, and the braking is great, as to be expected.

The car competes favorably with the other (impressive) cars in its class: the BMW 3-series, the Audi A4, and the Volvo C70.  The performance of this car is great, the comfort is better, and the price is better than its competitors.  As more and more people discover that Saabs have much to offer, and the dealerships treat customers better than any other manufacturers' do, Saabs will become more frequently seen on American roads everywhere.  They truly are worthy consideration as Europe's best.<br><br>
