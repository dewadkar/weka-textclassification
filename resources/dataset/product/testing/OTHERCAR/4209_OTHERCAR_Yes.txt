            This vehicle is a must have for families on the go. It is a comfortable vehicle for traveling long distances. Ours has taken several trips from PA to Fl and now from FL to PA. It has a comfortable ride, quiet and takes to the road well. This is also my vehicle of choice for frequent craft shows that I do for a living. It is comfortable to sit in for the long trips. It also holds everything I need for the weekend from large displays to excess inventory. This minivans holds more than you can imagine.
What I do not recommend doing with this vehicle is towing. Do not tow anything with this van. We had more repair bills associated with hauling a uhaul trailer from PA to FL than I care to mention. We own a 96 Caravan, the bottom of the line, nothing fancy. It does not have any kind of get-up-and-go. We are just about to reach 100,000 miles on it and we have replaced the transmission, torque converter, a timing belt, etc... Several belts have been replaced and the leaky air conditioning repaired. Currently we have an oil leak. This has been a pricey vehicle to maintain in my opinion BUT I really do enjoy using it.
The vehicle has with stood time and definitely abuse.
I would purchase another Caravan because they have improved on many features. One of which being the dual sliding doors. I would never buy one without this. At first I thought it was dumb and a hazard to children getting out into traffic. Now I wish I had an extra door to complain about. I really wish I had one.
Now if only the dealership were closer to where I live.
