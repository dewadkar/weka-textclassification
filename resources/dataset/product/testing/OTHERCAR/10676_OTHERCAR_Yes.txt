            The Audi S4 is a truly impressive machine. It looks much like an average family sedan, and is priced similarly to far inferior automobiles. However, it's capable of keeping up with some of the faster cars on the road.

Here's my usual break-down of a car review

The Drive:
When you first see an Audi S4, it really does not look spectacularly fast. (I know, I can't say that enough.) Other than minor changes to the front grill and a slightly lowered stance with fat tires. Have a seat in the driver's seat, start up the car, shift into first give the engine a little gas you'll quickly see this is not your standard Audi A4. Although this is a turbo-charged car, very little turbo lag is felt at all. In fact, this car's peak torque is achieved at an incredibly low 1850 rpm while it's peak horsepower is achieved at 5800 rpm. You can basically keep this engine at any rpm you want and it'll be ready to perform at all times. (By the way, this car achieves 250 horsepower and 258 ft-lbs of torque.) This car handles as well, if not better than many sports cars. Audi's Quattro system allows for some driver error, especially when traveling over slick roads. The car doesn't feel quite as responsive and precise as an M3, but it's really close. From a personal perspective, I would prefer to have the security of having four-wheel drive traction over slightly more precise steering. Also impressive about this car is its breaks. I jarred the breaks on this car when going 70mph and it came to a very quick and smooth stop with very little fade. The six speed manual feels very smooth, however it does have a fairly heavy clutch. The 5 speed automatic is ok; it offers manual gear selection, however I personally do not enjoy automatics in cars that are designed to be fast.

Interior:
This drivers position is generally comfortable, although much like the A4, it seems cramped for some reason. The controls are easy to reach, and are slightly confusing to use at first, but once they're mastered, they're easy enough to use. The stereo produces sound of decent quality, and the heater and air conditioner warm and cool the car quickly. In general, I have no serious complaints as to the interior of this car. Few cars that are as fast and handle as well as this car have interiors that are as practical and as functional as this one.

Exterior:
The perfect sports stealth car. It shouldn't attract much attention from Officers of the Law, and doesn't scream sporty at everyone. However, car enthusiasts and those familiar with Audi will quickly realize this isn't your average family sedan. The basic exterior design is elegant, however it is very slowly becoming dated as it has been around for a while.
