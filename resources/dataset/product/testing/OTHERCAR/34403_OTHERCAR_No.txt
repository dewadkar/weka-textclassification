            I was loaned a hyundai coupe SX (that is how it is badged here in ozzie land) fpr a period of 10days...the engine is a 1800cc engine DOHC as comapred to the FX model which is a 2000cc engine.
when i first stepped into the car...the interior looked impressive...but the paint on the gearknob scratched off after a day..overall i give the interior 8/10....for effort..the model that i was provided with had no electric mirrors or antenna which was disappointing
the body styling was very similiar to the japanese veilside bodykits, though i felt that it was trying to combine too many styles into one. For example, it was rounded yet squarish, look at the headlights. I reminds one of FORD's styling. And the bottom driving lights remind you of Honda's Integra.
as for the engine, it pumps out 94kw on the flywheel and the 1192kg body gives it a slower then normal accleration timing. maybe it could be better for the 2000cc engine but the 1800cc engine was lacking. A 1992 Honda CRX 1600cc DOHC engine produces 98kw so i am sure hyundai could do better given a little more work on the cams and cylinders. I suspect the problem would be in the weight of the car seeing that the rally models do not have any such problems, but the rally models also use a turbocharged engine in them. A closer ratio gearbox will also help probably.
talking about the gearbox, a very long gear throw from 1st to 2nd and 3rd to 4th...something very typical on hyundais....i wonder why? considering a short shifter costs roughly A$60. 
I must commend Hyundai on the suspension system though, it sticks to the ground and does not skid even though i was taking a corner at 60km/h. With a little modifications to the suspension it should handle quite well.
The bucket seats were a welcome change from the previous coupe, but the colour was slightly off though. The sound system in the car is above average for its price but that will differ from country to country.
overall, the car would do well for a normal driver who is looking for exceptional body looks and a little power on the throttle. However, i will not be willing to spend my A$26,000 on a car who will give potential problems as compared to getting a slightly used 1999 Nissan Pulsar SSS for A$20,000. The extra A$6,000 can be spent on a Primera body kit ($3000), $2000 on an Apexi AVC/ITC fuel controller and $1000 on a full exhaust system.<br><br>
