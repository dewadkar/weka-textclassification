            Several times over the past few years, my wife has swooned over Jeep Libertys. I remember, back in September, when she saw one sitting in the parking lot of the bowling alley on league night: 

&#147I think those are REALLY cute.&#148

&#147You like &#145em, huh?&#148

&#147Yeah, don&#146t you?&#148

&#147I dunno, they seem a little stubby to me &#133&#148

&#147No, they are cute!&#148

Well, they may be cute, but they&#146re stubby, too, and that includes the one parked out front in our driveway. Here&#146s how it got there &#133

The search for the vehicle started when I stopped by our local, small-town, dealer to see what they had on the lot in the way of Libertys. They had two, but both were 2-wheel drive models. I have got no use for a crippled Jeep. Jeeps are 4X4s. It would take illegal drugs and a severe beating to get me to ever sign papers on a 2-wheel drive Jeep.

So I asked the sales clerk to search the inventory lists of other dealers to see if she could find a 4X4 with the equipment I wanted. A Patriot Blue model turned up, but it didn&#146t have the 6-CD changer I was looking for. I checked with them to see if we could do a dealer installed option, but it turned out that it would cost more than the MSRP ($200) to have them stick one in. So I sent the sales gal back to see if she could find another one. 

This is what she returned with:
2004 Liberty Limited (The Limited is the street-trim version of the vehicle, the Sport is the basic line and the Renegade is the fancy off-roader)
28G package (full power, leather, trip computer, full-time 4X4, numerous upgrades)
Off Road package (Limited slip rear axle, heavy duty cooling, skid plates)
Heated seats
4 wheel anti-lock brakes
Side airbags
And of course, a 6-CD in-dash changer.

As you can see, we are talking about a fairly tricked-out Jeep. About the only options missing are a sunroof and a towing package. The Jeep Liberty is too short to tow much of anything and my wife does not care one way or another about sunroofs:  It seemed that this might be the right truck for the right woman. 

By the way, if you are noticing a certain lack of the use of the pronoun &#147We&#148 in this review, you would be correct. I didn&#146t tell her one thing about this purchase. It was a total surprise &#133 and man was I nervous. I made the mistake of buying a car once without telling my wife about it first. That was 30 years ago, and boy was she ever hot! I never did it again. 

But things change and I decided to risk her &#147wrath&#148 by buying her a new car and surprising her with it as an early Christmas gift. With our adult daughters acting as confederates, we conspired to get her Honda out of her hands long enough to get it over to the dealer for a trade-in evaluation without her knowledge. To make a long story short, it all worked out great, and we ended up getting her on videotape as she walked outside to meet her new Liberty, Timberline Green and decked out in a fancy red Christmas bow, sitting there in our driveway, a complete and utter surprise! Man it was great, and I got a big smooch too. She loves her new Liberty and I did not get in trouble for buying it without telling her

So how about that review?

To my way of thinking, the Liberty is a bit too small for my 6&#1462&#148 frame. The short wheelbase, while proving handy for maneuverability, does not seem to leave enough room on the inside for me to fit, front to back. The seats do not go back far enough to suit me and the legroom in the rear is pretty scarce when the front seats have been adjusted all the way back. But the vehicle fits my wife perfectly. She is a full foot shorter than me, and the Liberty shines for her. The electrically powered seats adjust nicely for her and she doesn&#146t have to sit as close to the steering wheel as she does when driving my pickup. 

Visibility is great. The tall &#147greenhouse&#148 roof of the Jeep affords the driver an excellent 360ï¿½ view around the vehicle and the upright seating position provides shorter drivers with a better vantage point than they might otherwise have. The powered seats adjust nicely, up and down, to improve this even further. And headroom is simply not an issue even for me. 

This is our first vehicle with heated seats. Since it&#146s winter now, my wife has been enjoying them immensely. They start to get warm almost immediately, and within about 90 seconds you will really feel the heat on your nethermost regions. 

Driving impressions:
This is one nimble vehicle. The turning radius, as might be expected with the 104&#148 wheelbase comes in at 36&#146. This allows an easy u-turn on most any residential street, and getting into and out of parking spots is pure cake. At highway speeds, the Jeep is fine too. It cruises easily at 70mph and the rack and pinion steering is very responsive with good road feel. But it is no sportscar. An early example of the Liberty managed to rollover in testing conducted by Autoweek and despite the adjustments made to the suspension in response to the event, a tall, narrow-tracked vehicle such as the Liberty is simply not made for the chicanes. Keep this in mind when driving at road speeds.

We haven&#146t had a chance to fully wring out the 4-wheel drive system yet. The 28G option package includes the Jeep Selec-Trac setup which features both a part-time 4X4 setting in both low and high ranges and a full-time selection for use on dry pavement. The full-time setting engages a differential in the transfer case so that you do not experience driveline binding or &#147bucking&#148 in tight turns on dry pavement. Switching between 2-wheel and 4-wheel drive is accomplished by pulling up a selector lever positioned just to the left of the floor mounted gear selector. You can change settings at road speeds up to 55 mph unless you want to engage the 4WD low setting. To do that you must slow down to about 2 mph and creep along slowly until it &#147catches&#148.

One of the advantages of buying the &#147off-road&#148 package is that it includes a limited slip differential in the rear axle. The limited slip does a great job of distributing torque to both rear wheels and is far safer when hitting slippery patches of road.

The 3.7-liter V-6 provides ample power for the Liberty. It is not as peppy as my Dakota Pickup with the 4.7-liter V-8, but it gets off the line fairly well and feels plenty strong. We do not expect to get great mileage from it, but my wife&#146s commute is only a couple of miles so a tank should last quite awhile.

I did have a chance to try out the 4-wheel anti-lock brakes on Christmas day in a nearly deserted parking lot. It was raining so I decided to test them out to see how they behaved on a slick surface. I accelerated to 35mph and stomped the pedal hard enough to lock up the tires on a conventionally braked vehicle. You can just feel the pulses as the anti-lock system kicks in, and the Jeep tracked perfectly throughout the stop with full steering control. Most impressive.

Creature comforts at speed:
The Jeep Liberty is no Lexus. The interior trim and leather look great, but at rest they tend to belie the fact that this is still a Jeep. Wind noise is certainly noticeable at highway speed, as are both the engine and tire songs. If you are looking for a silent ride, the Liberty is not for you. I don&#146t want to paint too bad a picture here, but at heart, the Jeep Liberty is still a truck, first and foremost. A fancy one, but a truck, nonetheless. The ride quality is good, better than I expected, really. The vehicle handles road surface irregularities really well and the independent front suspension is a great improvement over the old solid axle front ends of the 4X4 days of yore. All is nice and tight in the coachwork, too. No rattles. 

Storage:
Access to the cargo area has been nicely designed to be a one-handed affair. The remote keyless entry system will automatically pop the back window open for you if you prefer, but reaching in through the window will not be easy for shorter persons. However, one easy pull on the cargo door handle electrically releases the swing-up window first, then opens the door in one easy sequence. This is a very nice touch and quite useful when you have a bag of groceries in one arm. The rear seats fold down easily for additional cargo space when required, but the tailgate only opens out, not down, so if you need to haul anything really long, strap it on the roof rack instead.

A vehicle you can tow:
One of the really nice features of the 4X4 Liberty is that it is one of the few automatic transmission-equipped vehicles that is towable without modification. The transfer case has a &#147neutral&#148 setting and when that is selected, you can tow the vehicle on all fours behind an RV without installing any form of auxiliary transmission fluid pumps or the like. Keep in mind that this only applies to the 4X4 version of the Liberty, not the 2WD variants. One more reason not to buy a crippled Jeep!

So, overall, I would rate the Jeep Liberty as a solid little truck for the under 6&#146 crowd. I think taller people might have issues with the limited legroom, but the only way to really tell is to sit in one and decide for yourself. It won&#146t be much of a problem around here, however. It&#146s my wife&#146s Jeep, and she will be doing the driving, not me.
