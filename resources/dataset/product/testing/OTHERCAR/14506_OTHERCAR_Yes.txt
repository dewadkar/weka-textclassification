            I always liked the idea of the Nissan Frontier Crew Cab...it was just a little blah looking to me.  But then came the 2001!  Wow what a stunner!  I was counting the days until the release of the new style.  So in August of last year I was one of the first ones in town to sport the new Crew Cab.  I have put about 9500 miles on it so far and have loved every minute of it.

I am only 5'7" so things like headroom and legroom mean little and are hard to judge, but it has plenty of both for me.  As for the interior finish, I opted for the SE with leather, sunroof, automatic, and 6 disc changer.  The leather is a little cheaper looking than our Honda Passport, but it's easier to clean than cloth.  Road noise is kept down to a minimum, which is nice, albeit unusual for a truck.  The sound system is sufficient however, the CD player sound is <b>a lot</b> better than the receiver.

When I bought mine, the SC was not available, however I don't think I would have bought it anyway.  The 170 hp is adequate but lower than most vehicles in it's class. My wife's Passport has 205 and it's a noticeable difference. It's fuel economy is worse than most as well, but only slightly. I get around 18-19 on trips which is right on target with the EPA estimate.

I am more than satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this truck to anyone considering it.  I don't think you can get more for your money.
