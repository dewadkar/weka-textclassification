            We drove a 1998 Dodge Stratus rental car for about a week while our car was having bodywork done, and I was pleasantly surprised by this capable car.

The model we drove had the 150-horsepower 4-cylinder engine mated to an automatic transmission.  Usually that's a prescription for slow, but in this case there was power to be had.  Occasionally I had to manually shift down to 3rd gear for the power, but the engine had surprising oomph, both from a standstill, and while driving at freeway speeds.  However, I'd still be much happier if Dodge offered a manual transmission in this car.

The handling of this &quot;Cloud&quot; car was another nice surprise.  While there was a lot of body roll, I could pitch the car into a turn and it would cling there, even if it did feel like the doorhandle was donating to the traction fund.  The steering was better than most American cars, in any case.

The interior drew no ire from me...the seats were comfortable, the major controls fell where I'd expect them to be, and everything was of an acceptable quality...not as nice as expensive European cars, but not as chintzy as a lot of car interiors today.

I've liked the styling since first seeing a Cirrus in 1994, and I think the Cloud cars still look competitive in today's market.<br><br>
