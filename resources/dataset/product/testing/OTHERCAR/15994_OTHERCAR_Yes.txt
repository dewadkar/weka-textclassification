            Well, being a youngster and all, I just got my license a while back and this is the lovely vehicle my parents decided to let me drive. All my friends tagged it the &quot;Shaggin' Wagon,&quot; because there's so much room in the back (shaking my head)(sigh) children now-a-days. Really it's a great ride and gets me where I need to go.

My parents bought this van about a year ago, it's of course a '92 model with sunroof and all. The family was really tired of driving for hours to visit family in small compact cars so we decided to purchase the van. 

The air condition is great, also adjustable for riders in the back, seeing we live in Florida, the air condition is a must. Power windows, locks, and an amazing cd/stereo system is also part of the package for this family van. I always turn the radio up when I drive by myself. I haven't hooked up any speakers and it's still bumpin' that bass.

The gas capacity is about 20 gallons and travels smoothly on the road, no noise, a very nice, quiet ride indeed. So it's not the most fashionable car, not the most expensive, and not the best known car out there, but it's affordable and if I can drive it you can drive it. I'm a short person who drives a pretty sizable vehicle and once I started using the van I forgot about all the small cars and all the beamers (hard to do). 

For any younger people out there, I'd recommend you drive this van, it's affordable for the family and can save you money, which is definitely a priority in our lives. I love this vehicle and I'm glad my parents made me drive it and it saves me from the lecturing they would have given if they would have bought a new car for me.

Sure I may not know much about cars now, but this is a bargain and best of all a great compromise between the anxious young drivers and apprehensive, cautious parents. And remember everyone, buckle up! It's the law :)<br><br>
