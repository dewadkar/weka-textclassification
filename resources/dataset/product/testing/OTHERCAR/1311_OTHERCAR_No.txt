Why did you buy this vehicle?

I am a tried-and-true Honda buyer, working my way through two Civics and one Accord before falling for the Passport. I intended to buy the CRV but the test drive was a real disappointment in terms of power. I leased the Passport because the test drive was great, I was able to negotiate a better deal than I could have on the CRV and because the lease terms from the dealer were favorable. That was about all I knew about the Passport when I brought it home. I was banking on the Honda reputation for reliability.

Describe what you love and hate about this vehicle.

It turns out I love this car, mostly. There is a major drawback that I'll get to in a bit, but first the positives. I've never had an SUV before, and I never realized I'd find the cargo capabilities so handy. My large dog can ride in the way back without getting his fur &amp; smell on the upholstery. (I added the rubber cargo mat as an option, which I highly recommend to dog owners.) I can tote plants and home improvement supplies easily in the cargo area - if I have long stuff, it's a piece of cake to lay down half of the back seat. If I have large stuff, like a sheet of plywood, the luggage rack is ideal. Minor drawback, cloth seats stain easily, even with scotchguard. But overall, I love the drive, improved visibility of sitting up high and the car has been extremely reliable, which I expected from Honda. There have been trips to the dealer for recall and warranty service, but nothing extraordinary. I've used the 4WD low, feature once on an extremely challenging trip to friends' unimproved land in the mountains. We kept up with our friends' Land Rover, no problem. (They were impressed too.) I've used 4WD high several times in the snow, and felt extremely secure.

Major drawback: Honda dealerships don't really know how to service the Passport. It's really an Isuzu. I had about 2 weeks of hassle surrounding my 30,000 mile service. I initially took it to the dealership, whose list price for a 30,000 mile Honda service is $325. They advised me that it might be slightly more expensive for a 4WD, then later called to tell me it would be $590. (This is not &quot;slightly&quot; more, in my book.) Why? All the fluid changes associated with the 4WD mechanism. I ditched the dealer and took it to another shop, not a dealership, but a very reputable local Honda specialist. They returned the car to me unserviced, because the Isuzu referral, the Honda referral and my owner's manual all conflicted about the fluids needed. I ended up having to pay the $590 at the dealer to keep the car in warranty, which I felt was essentially a hostage situation. It is this experience that has turned me off Honda, at least that dealership. Primarily, it has convinced me that if you want the real Honda experience, you have to buy a real Honda.

I would also say that now that I know how expensive it is to service 4WD vehicles, I wouldn't recommend one to anyone who doesn't really need that feature. In the future, chains will be fine for my annual visit to snow territory. Besides which, I could definitely use better gas mileage (I get 20 MPG max, more like 15 usually.) 

My lease is up this spring and I will turn the car in. I'm looking at other manufacturers for the first time in 13 years.

What is it like to drive this vehicle?

It's great to be &quot;above it all&quot; in an SUV, but with the stiff suspension, you really know when you hit a bump! The buttons and controls are logically positioned, except that the &quot;power&quot; and &quot;winter&quot; buttons (which I rarely use intentionally) are easy to accidentally hit with a drink as they are located on the center drink holder/console.

Who should buy this vehicle? 

People who really need cargo capacity AND 4WD capabilities often enough to justify it.

Who shouldn't?

People, like me, looking for the &quot;Honda&quot; experience.
