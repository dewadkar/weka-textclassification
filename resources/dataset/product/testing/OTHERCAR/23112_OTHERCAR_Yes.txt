            We recently went on vacation and our rental car was a 1998 Dodge Stratus Sedan.  We rent cars fairly often and had never received this particular model before, so we weren't sure what we were in for.  First I should say that we were driving a distance of 600 miles one way, so in all we put over 1500 miles on this car within two week.  We averaged about 36 miles per gallon, one of the best of all the cars we've rented in the past.

Since this was a rental car we didn't have all the extra perks, but we did have AM/FM, cassette, power steering, AC, power locks/windows.  The car was very room both in the front and the back.  The seatbelts for the front are great because they let you adjust the position at the point where the belt is attached to the door area, so it wasn't digging into our necks.  We had our one year old daughter with us on this trip, so having extra space was important to us.  We had no problems at all with the handling of this car or the gas mileage and the ride was fairly quiet and comfortable.

There are cup holders in the front as well a two holders in the console in the backseat.  The Stratus also has three seatbelts in the backseat, which some other models do not offer.  Also if you have children riding with you, right away you will notice that the rear windows only come down halfway.  As well as after you start the car and put it in drive the doors automatically lock.  I think both of those features are very important if you have child passengers.

The trunk is another great asset to this car because it is very roomy. We had it packed full of stuff and the rear end handling was still great.  We drove in the city with it and the mileage was still good, as well as we drove through the mountains of WV and had no problems at all.  This is a very efficient car for anyone.  We are actually considering purchasing a Stratus when we are ready to buy a car.  You can choose this car with only the basics and still come out ahead!<br><br>
