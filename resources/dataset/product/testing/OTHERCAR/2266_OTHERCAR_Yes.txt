            I bought a 1998 Isuzu Amigo 4x4 Soft top because I thought Amigos would never get an automatic transmission.  I later learned that the 1999 Amigos would have the option, so I sold the 1998 one and bought a 1999 Amigo with all the options.  I had to call about 8 dealerships in order to find a 4x4 with all the options I wanted, but it was worth the trouble.  I love this vehicle.  It has 205 horsepower and can take on all but the most expensive sports cars.  It can be troublesome getting to the back seats, but once you are seated, there is plenty of room.  It also handles corners very well.  I love the six cup holders - I use them all.  There are only two problems with the Amigo - an uncomfortable ride and unsupportive seats.  Eventually I am going to replace the seats and the shocks so that I can overcome these shortcomings.  Other than that, this is my favorite vehicle of all time.  I also like the fact that there are very few Amigos on the road.  I always hate it when the vehicle I'm driving is seen all over the place.  This vehicle allows me to feel unique.  Anyone who wants an inexpensive sports utility vehicle should buy this one - it has the most power for the least amount of money.  What other vehicle has dual sun roofs???<br><br>
