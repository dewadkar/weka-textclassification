            I have driven a wide variety of cars in my life but none have as much of a storied history as the Impala SS. Many baby boomers will remember the SSes of the '60s with big, honkin' motors (e.g. 409 cid) and the tire melting acceleration.

Well, let's fast forward to 1994, the year Chevrolet decided to bring the Impala SS out of hibernation.  When I first saw the concept vehicle at an Auto Show, I drooled.  Period.  Although this car shared a lot of with the Caprice 9C1 it was based on, tit had the aggressive appearance that I loved (didn't help it was in my favorite color - Black). 
The front end of the car could be summed up in one word - menacing.  The grille design lent a lot to the aggressive appearance as well as the taillight treatment and the subtle spoiler.  The 17" ROH ZR6 rims added a little panache to the vehicle.  

Driving one of these beasts will definitely take you back to the muscle car era.  The 260 hp LT-1 gives the car enough thrust to take out quite a few V-8 powered vehicles.  The transmission gives crisp, decisive shifts while handling the 330 ft/lbs of torque this car puts down.
In one test drive, I actually lit the tires up on a few main streets (accidentally).  Another advantage is that these motors have enough aftermarket support that you could easily turn one of these cars into a serious beast.

As for the interior, I found myself with enough room to be comfortable.  However, I liked the floor mounted shifter (versus tree mounted in 1994-95) and the analog gauges (versus digital in 1994-95).  Other than that, there was really nothing spectacular about the interior of the SS.

But with that much go under foot, who cares?

The steering on these cars will definitely not remind you of a BMW 7 series but it does track pretty well for a 4300+ pound boulevard basher.  However, the steering is pretty responsive (again due to its 9C1 influence) and the handling is pretty decent because of the 9C1 underpinnings and the meaty 255/50/17 tires.

However, the challenge with the cars now is trying to find one that is in good shape or hasn't been modded to oblivion.
Another issue with these cars, like the 2000-2003 Nissan Maxima, is trying to find the tires.  The size is not common among manufacturers and many owners have been forced to go to 275/40/17 or a more common size.

Despite that, the car is still enjoyable to drive around town and has enough cajones to win the stoplight grand prix.
