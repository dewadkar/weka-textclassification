            In August of 1999 I bought a Kia Sportage 4 dr, 4 wheel drive.  I really liked it.  It wasn't too big, looked good and, with the $2000 Rebate it was a great deal.  My wife REALLY loved it.  So much so that two weeks later she bought her own Kia Sportage.  She bought a 2 wheel drive model.  Now we have two 1999 Kia Sportages in our driveway.  We tell everyone how much we like these SUV's.  We haven't had any problems with them.  They drive well and are easy to handle.  You can put a lot of cargo iside and it loads and unloads easily.  The controls are well-placed and easy to find.  The Kias Sportage is a winner in our books!  There is more road noise than my last car, a Camry, but it is not annoying.  Also, it does not get very good gas mileage (22-23 mpg).  Overall, it is an excellent value for the money and we recommend it.<br><br>
