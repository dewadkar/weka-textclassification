  At first I loved the idea of getting the a minivan.I was right in doing that because this is probably the best car I have ever ridden in.If you get it fully loaded it comes with a sunroof,leather interior a built in T.V &amp; video player.Also a tape &amp; CD player.The only bad thing about the TV is it is on the roof. But you can listen to the TV on the radio or through the headphones.But you can only watch movies or play video games on a N64. All in all it's a great car.I love it so much that when I'm not in the car I want to be in it very badly. Those who read this should definitely buy it.<br><br>
