            We bought our 1996 Oldsmoblie Achieva used in 1998.  We were driving a compact car at the time and had an addition to our family, and needed a bigger car.  We shopped around for a while and fell in love with the Achieva.  I must say now that we made a wise choice.  We've had the car for almost 3 years now and it has 90,000+ miles on it, and we've never had the first problem with it.  The only work that my husband has done on it is changed a belt, new brakes, tires, and the usual oil changes.  We've only done the usual preventive maintenance that all cars require.

I've been on many trips in my Achieva, and it has done well every time.  Just recently I made a 600 mile trip alone with my kids and didn't have any problem.  Even with 90,000 miles on it!!!  The car is so dependable. I know that I can get in and start it up and it will get me where I'm going every time.

The mode we have (Achieva SL) came with daytime running lights for safety, power door locks, windows, anti-lock brakes, cruse control, rear defrost and window locks.  I absolutely love my Achieva and would recommend it to anybody.  Mine's been a very dependable car.<br><br>
