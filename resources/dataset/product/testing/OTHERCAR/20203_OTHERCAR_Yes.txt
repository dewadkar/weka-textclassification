            Back in '99 I got a new job which required me to drive all over the Miami/Ft. Lauderdale area.  I worked on telecom equipment, so I had to carry a lot of test equipment (large boxes) and hand tools with me.  The vehicle I bought also had to double as a family hauler, so a pickup was out.  Since I knew I'd be racking up a lot of miles, I didn't want to buy anything expensive.  Since I'm a fairly bulky person (6'1, 240 lbs) I needed the largest car I could afford.  I looked at the Dodge Cirrus, Ford Taurus, and some imports (though they were more expensive). SUVs were out due to their price &amp; their unquenchable thirst for gas.

Enter the Chevy Malibu.  To be honest, I picked it mostly because of what it wasn't.  It wasn't too expensive, too small, to delicate, or too expensive to maintain. There was nothing I loved about the car, it just did everything with a minimum of fuss, and the styling didn't shout &quot;break into me and take my stereo!&quot;.  I paid $15,500 for a bright white Malibu with tan cloth interior. The car is the base model, but came with a decent list of standard features: AC, auto, AM/FM, intermittent wipers, power mirrors, &amp; full instrumentation.  Pretty much a typical fleet/rental car..nothing fancy. 
 
I've had it a year, and put 30K on it.  That number is misleading, since I spent innumerable hours just sitting with the A/C on eating meals, or writing reports.  I mean, I spent 12 solid hours a day in this thing, in all kinds of very hot weather (including a hurricane)...so the engine probably has more like 35 or 40 K on it.
  
How did it hold up under this kind of abuse?  Very well actually.  

Good stuff:
After a year, it still drives pretty much like new.  The paint finish has held up very well. My car is white, and I've never waxed it.  There are no scratches, and it's still shiny.  I read another review that stated the paint had problems, but that's not the case with mine. The only maintenance I've done has been oil changes &amp; brake pads.  The headlights are also the best of any car or truck I've owned. They're not a $2000 HID system, but they have a bright &amp; uniform beam pattern. The trunk is large, has a low lift-over sill, and holds a lot of stuff.  The dash has full instrumentation, with large easy to read proper analog dials.  The A/C blows a torrent of frigid air even on the hottest Miami afternoon.  There are plenty of cup holders, and everything my kids spilled on the interior washed off easily. The seats are very comfortable, and I literally lived in the car some days.  I had plenty of room, and it was always a pleasant place to work.

The bad stuff:
The Malibu's tires are not the greatest.  They're loud, and not very sticky in the corners.  I've had to replace 2 of the originals due to punctures (I guess that's my fault, not the cars').  Annoying rattles emanate from both front door map pockets.  It only happens at a certain resonant frequency, so it comes &amp; goes with engine speed.  Still, it's a loud buzzing, and unacceptable in a brand new car.  I had to jam some maps (it IS a map pocket after all) in there to get it to stop.  The car had 2 mechanical failures; the battery and the blower fan control.  The positive battery terminal corroded &amp; broke off at around 20K.  It was replaced under warranty by the dealer, even though the car was out of warranty by then.  The fan switch positions 1 &amp; 2 went out around the same time (I haven't had that fixed yet).

My overall opinion of the '99 Malibu is that it's exactly what I expected.  I've beaten on the car pretty hard over the year, and nothing much broke off!  It sure isn't my dream car, but it was inexpensive for a new car of that size.  It's done everything I've asked it to, and it still looks &amp; drives like new.  For $15,500 I would say that I got good value for my money.<br><br>
