              The Toyota Sienna XLE a front runner when it comes to convenience. The Passenger door is motorized and is also ready when you have a bag full of groceries with Remote Push Button entry.  The other side has a manually opened spacious door.
  All the functions that you would expect the stock luxury line to have are accessible on the dash.  Such as the motorized rear pop out windows, the rear A/C unit, Dual plug in for the laptop or cell phone or R/detector.  The cassette/CD player is easily operated and fingertip accessible, on the steering wheel or dash.  The cruse control can be operated on the steering wheel also.  The Power sunroof is tinted and responds in two auto locations.  There is efficient lighting throughout the van.  Not only is it easy to drive and maintain with the Toyota Bumper to Bumper Warranty But night driving is a breeze with superb visibility.
  It has classy looks and comfortable interior.  The foot rails are sturdy enough to manage even the portliest of owners.  
  The Drivers seat is powered with arm rest and the front four are arm rested also.  The two in the middle are removable for cargo space.  theres not much to it, just fold, pull a handle and place where you want to.  The same goes for the two seats in the back.  In a nutshell all the options on the XLE are easily usable and each option is of good design!
