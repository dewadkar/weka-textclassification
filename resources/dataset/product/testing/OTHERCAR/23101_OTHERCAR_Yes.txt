            Received as a Christmas gift, I love my Polaroid digital camera.  I am not a serious photographer. I mainly wanted a digital camera to take photos to post on my website.

The Polaroid PDC 640 was an affordable model.  My particular camera was part of a special package that included photo software, a USB cord, and an AC adapter. The AC adapter was particularly helpful, since this camera consumes a lot of battery power.

The camera provides various options that help improve the quality of photos. Menu options include resolution and quality choices, as well as exposure settings that improve picture quality.  The preview option is also helpful, as it allows you to decide to keep a photo, before it saves.

In spite of all of the strengths of the camera, there are a few drawbacks, as well. As mentioned, it does consume a lot of battery power, which can become expensive. Therefore, I suggest using the AC adapter, whenever possible.  When the battery life is low, certain functions such as flash and preview are unavailable.  Also, the casing of the camera is not very durable, as mine is cracked, and I am not sure why.  This is just superficial damage, though, and does not affect the function of the camera.

I would recommend this camera for children, teenagers, and people who are seeking a digital camera for recreational use.  If you are seeking standard-quality photos, I would suggest a higher grade model.
