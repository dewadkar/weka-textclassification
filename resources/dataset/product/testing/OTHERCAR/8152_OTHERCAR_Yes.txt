            Mega-fun at a less than mega-pixal price...thats the Polaroid FunFlash camera.  Ok, it's not state of the art with a boat load of flashy features, the resolution is only 640x480, no memory sticks, cards or floppies and the software package doesn't retail for the price of a good used car.  With all that said, would I recommend this camera for the average shmuck...you bet!

First and foremost, this is an entry level camera at an entry level price ($128 at Walmart).  If your a professional photographer or a real gadget freak this is not the right product but for my needs of putting an occasional, good quality 640x480 resolution on the web with relative speed, ease and low cost, this camera is great.  At the highest resolution of (640x480) you can store 15 images.  Not enough for a 2 week vacation but plenty to email a picture of the kids to Grandma and Grandpa or put a picture on your web page.  It should be noted that the $128 also gets all the accessories including an AC power adapter to conserve you batteries when downloading images.  Battery conservation, like most digital cameras is an important issue but the FunFlash is relatively easy on the power unless you use the 1.8&quot; LCD continuously.

The LCD screen is a little blurry but more than adequate for preview and because the camera has a built in viewfinder, using the LCD for aiming is not required (a great battery saver).

Flash is provided by a built in flash and my experience has been good in low light conditions although the photographer must select the mode of flash (off, auto or forced) each time the camera is turned on.  It would be nice to be able to select &quot;auto&quot; as a default.

The software is easy to install and does a good basic job.  Don't expect miracles but for the features it does have are clear and easy to use.

If your digital photo needs are like mine where your photo volume is low, viewing will be mainly screen based and &quot;bang for the buck&quot; is important the Polaroid FunFlash will do a great job for you.<br><br>
