            As soon as I turned seventeen, and my driver's liscense became official, my parents handed over the keys to our 1996 Toyota Camry.  This was my first car, and I was extremely excited that not only did I now have the freedom to get from place top place, but I had a cute little compact to get me there.  The car I recieved was gold, and I highly recommmend that color to all possible consumers of this vehicle.  This car is dependable, barely skids on ice and rarely needs a tuneup.  My family has put over 100,000 miles on the car in the past five years, and it still holds up with relatively no problems. In a few years, when I have to think about buying a new car for myself, I will definately consider a Toyota Camry.<br><br>
