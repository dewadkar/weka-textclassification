            My husband is active duty in the US Army, therefore we travel a lot.  I wanted something that would fit a lot of things and our 2 children and us comfortably.  We also intend on having more children and have a lot of pets, so a car was just not going to work anymore.  The reason I picked a Chevrolet Astro Van was because I was told by a co-worker that his brother owned one, had been in a head on collision, and no one was injured.  Safety is something very important to me.  It is a 1991, and I bought it in 1996.  There really is nothing I hate about it.  There are things that have gone wrong, like the switches to the door locks and windows went out and I had to replace them.  The only other problems that I've had have been self inflicted wounds to it.  For example, the sliding door sticks because of how many times my girls have spilled drinks, I got a new engine because the place I took it to have the oil changed didn't put any new oil in it.  Otherwise, it has been very dependable, no problems.  The only thing I do notice, but it's old, and I don't take care of my tires like I should, is that when the tire pressure starts to drop, the van shakes a little as I slow down quickly.  For example from the interstate to the exit ramp.  I would recommend a Chevy anything to anyone, but the Astro Van that I own is exceptional!<br><br>
