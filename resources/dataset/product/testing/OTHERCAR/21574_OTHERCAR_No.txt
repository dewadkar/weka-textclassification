            I bought my 1995 Intrepid in 1998.  The price was right, the car handled and rode like a dream, was beautiful, had plenty of pick-up and in 2 short years, has cost me over $4,000 in repairs!  $2,500 of that came in a 3 week period!  Air conditioner repairs, air conditioner REPLACEMENT, transmission REPLACEMENT, tires, belts, turn signal wiring, are only a few of the repairs (plus towing of course).  The list is endless.  

I currently am watching the paint bubble up and flake off my car at a record rate. Good thing the primer color is silver like the outside color! Lucky me.  

I have averaged a trip to my local garage every 3 MONTHS.  They love me.  They tell me that they need to add an addition onto the garage and with my help, they'll be able to do it soon.  I have been there so often, the employees know where I live and work from transporting me. They don't ask me for directions, just where I want to be dropped off.  

As a single parent with a son in college, we share this car.  Unfortunately, I cannot afford another car at this point.  I can't afford another car because of what THIS car has cost me!  

To anyone who is thinking of buying one of these very attractive looking vehicles..don't do it.  It is a decision you will regret deep down in your wallet.  Seeing so many Intrepid's on the road, I thought they were good, reliable cars.  Now I know better...Intrepid's are on the road because owners have put so much money into repairs, they can't afford to trade them in.  

As my review title states, &quot;This Is NOT The Car of Your Dreams.&quot;  Maybe I should have added &quot;unless you like nightmares.&quot;   <br><br>
