            The 2001 Tundra is a pick-up truck that has come of age.  Its predecessor, the T-100, was not a deadbeat.  It certainly was a Toyota product in styling and reliability, but perhaps it didn't make the grade for the North American half-ton and up truck market.  The V-6 engine, which in itself is not a faux paus, meant the end of the line for the consumer bent on more power.  Toyota picked up the vibe, and for all the hype and subsequent failure associated with the T-100, the company came out swinging with the Tundra.  

The Tundra, like other Toyota products, is assembled in the United States.  The factory for the Tundra is in Indiana, regionally alligned with the Kentucky plant that pumps out the Camry and Avalon.  Much of its components, such as engine and transmission are manufactured in Japan.  Much of the sheet metal and downright assembly occurs on U.S. soil.  The Tundra is also a vehicle that is primarily manufactured for presentation to the U.S. market.  Its conformation attests to this fact, as it roughly equals in size its domestically badged competition.  When it comes to the competition, the Tundra does just that, it competes, and how.

<b>Engine:</b> The V-8 engined Tundra breaks new ground in engine refinement for pick-up trucks.  The 4.7 liter DOHC V-8 offers copious torque and smooth transitions.  Don't expect a wheel burner here, however.  It is the same block that Lexus utilizes in their LS400, but in a seriously detuned variation.  The Lexus V-8 creates in the neighborhood of 340 HP, the I-Force V-8 a notable 95 less.  The reason for the detuned status, I theorize torque and reliability, considering the purpose of the truck to bear loads and tow things.  Nonetheless, the V-8 powerplant in a Tundra is Nirvana for the person that desires Toyota quality in a vehicle that approximates the dimension and power of a domestically badged pick-up.  The V-8 Tundra has power to spare.

<b>Body and Bed:</b> The Tundra short bed, the most popular conformation to date, because that is all that is available in an extra-cab variant, passes the plywood sheet test, but only if you leave the tailgate down.  The sides of the Tundra's bed are shallow by comparison, but this has caused me little or no problem in hauling.  The truck bed has four hard points bolted in each corner with a decent mooring point for straps and bunjis.  Adding a popular tool box as an aftermarket option will interfere somewhat with the forward mooring points, but I've learned to deal with it such that they remain useful.  Honestly, if you put a tool box in the bed of a short-bed Tundra (which all extra-cab models are), you will find some shortcomings in bed space.

<b>Interior and Appointments:</b> The Tundra has a very adequate passenger compartment and comfortable seats for the front seat occupants.  The rear seat in the Tundra extra-cab is cramped, bottom line.  My Tundra SR5 features the four door option, which opens the space up to access from the outside, but the fact is that the Tundra rear seat is too small.  My four year old rides in a car seat mounted in the center rear position, and her feet can frequently be found on the center console fold down assembly.  The Tundra rear seat is small, and the back is bolt upright.  No one over three or four years old will survive a 100 mile journey back there.  I've inspected the competition, and here is where the competition takes the Tundra to the mat.  

As far as appointments, in the SR5 trim level, my Tundra has cloth seats which are very comfortable, the plastic that is used for the dash and instrument panel is acceptable, and the convenience level is pretty good.  The truck features full gauges, a pull out cupholder on the dash, a flip down center console bin with cupholders, map pockets in the doors and the two sub doors, back of passenger/driver seat map pockets, and under rear seat storage.  You can flip the seat bottom of the rear seat up, and access storage, I just never do, because we have a child seat installed, and it is a pain to move it.  The truck also features a sliding rear window, which is something I used as a kid, but now I never open it.

<b>Safety:</b> The Tundra does very well in insurance crash tests, it does better than any of its competition.  The truck features driver and passenger airbags, and reactive seat belts.  If you want anti-lock brakes, that is an option (an annoying thing, in my opinion), they should equip all pick-up trucks with at least rear anti-lock brakes.  The standard Tundra features front discs and rear drums.  The Tundra braking system is well designed and up to the task of stopping the Tundra without warping the rotors or other common maladies.  

<b>Extras:</b> If you buy the Tundra with the mid-level or higher stereo, you will be surprised at its fidelity, especially if you are a Toyota enthusiast, accustomed to the crappy Toyota stereos of lore.  The Tundra's middle of the road stereo features six speakers, in-dash CD and cassette deck, as well as an ample AM/FM tuner.  The antenna is fixed mount.  With even the mid-level stereo, the music lover will find some pause in running out and replacing the factory set-up.

<b>Tires and Wheels, other accessories:</b> My Tundra came with 16" steel wheels and Bridgestone radials which have been excellent.  My truck also came with a load leveling (frame) trailer hitch, which proved itself on a 1200 mile journey towing a ton and a half boat.  Many Tundras I see have fender treatments, but mine doesn't, and I'm glad.  My truck also features push-button, on-dash four wheel drive.  Just remember that 2001 models and earlier were not available with limited slip differentials.  If you really want one, you can buy one now on the 2002.  One other whacky, useful feature?  The tailgate shuts and has a key lock tumbler.  Great feature!  

<b>Road Manners:</b> This truck exhibits excellent road manners, with its rack and pinion steering, and it is supremely muted for a pick-up truck.  The Tundra really drives like a dream, and my V-8 SR5 FWD model features speed sensitive steering, which becomes evident when you go to drive something else that doesn't have that feature.  This is a quiet, smooth, powerful machine on the road.

<b>Paint, fit and finish:</b> I'd have to come out and say the Tundra is one of the best of the best.  Mine is white, and the paint is flawless.  The interior gray cloth, while not noteworthy for its appearance, is adequate, and seems like it will last a while.  The dash and other plastic might smack a bit of cheapness, but the full gauge panel and other things have me looking the other way.  Outward visibility is good, but rearward visibility deserves another look from the engineers.  

<b>Conclusion:</b>  If you never sample a Tundra, then you will be OK, you won't be compelled to buy one.  If you do drive one, look out, you'll want one.  They do come out to be a little more expensive up front, but if you extrapolate Toyota quality, they might even make up for their high up-front cost and cancel out any savings made on buying the cheaper pick-up.  The 4.7L DOHC V-8 is not a gas saver by any means, towing my boat at highway speeds it averaged 11 miles per gallon, by itself on the highway it gets about 16.

Seriously, though, if you have any inclination or interest in one of these Tundra trucks, the proof is in the driving.  If you can get by with the paltry rear space, it could be that a Tundra is in the cards for you.  

It was for me, and my family loves the truck just like I do.

Good luck in the choosing!
