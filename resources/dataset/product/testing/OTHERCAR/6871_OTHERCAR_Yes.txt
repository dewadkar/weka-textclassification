            Overall this is a great car. We researched all the cars in our price range and this was one of the best. Overall we saved $2500 in rebates and cash back which made a nice down payment. 

Not only is it one of the best overall, it also has a great warranty and is one of the cheapest. Hyundai has the best warranty out there, a 5 year 60,000 mile warranty on all parts and labor, a 10 year 100,000 mile power train and a 5 year unlimited roadside assistance. 

It's sporty but still roomy enough for 5 people. If you have a limited budget and want a compact car this is the car for you. Makes a great first car. 

We've put 20,000 miles on it so far and haven't had much trouble. We have replaced the clutch but it was completely covered by the warranty and we received a rental car free of charge. 

As in all new cars the value does decrease as soon as you drive it off the lot. Doesn't make a good car If you want to be able to trade it in every year for a new one.<br><br>
