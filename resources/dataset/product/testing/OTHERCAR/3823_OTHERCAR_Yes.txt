            I love the high seating, I am a big guy but found the seat very comfortable, although the armrest is useless. 

There is considerable road/tire noise on anything but the smoothest roads. I have a gut feeling that better tires would get rid of a lot of that noise. 

I hear everyone whine about the center rear headrest blocking rear visibility. HELLO!!!???!!! the thing pops right out, duh! the only people that will sit (or even fit) in the rear center seat are children to small to even need the headrest. Front and rear visibility are great, but side visibility is very bad for what it could/should be, particularly on the right, near the rear. 

I took my CR-V up I-90 E towards Snoqualmie pass, at about 75 mph I could still accelerate and pass with relative ease, I was pleasantly surprised at that. 

The first time I parallel parked my CR-V was in a fairly tight spot, but I aced it first try. For the size of this car, parking is a breeze. 

Handling is very nice, but I wouldn't say it is "car-like", it handles well for a vehicle it's size and shape, but not like a good handling car. 

Fit and finish are EXCELLANT, as you would expect from Honda. 

Driver controls are well laid-out and intuitive, but the windshield wipers ARE NOT INTERMITTANT as listed on several web sites, but work well anyway (Seattle area).

I am thrilled with my CR-V.
