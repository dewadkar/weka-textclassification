            Subaru Forester 2002

Forester the Savior!

For years Subaru was the un-contested champion of the all-wheel drive vehicle. I still clearly remember their earlier television ads with the US Ski Olympic Team, proudly saying that to get on top they drive a Subaru.

Then financial hard time hit the auto manufacturer
as it hits all the other. The one exception was that Subaru had put all their eggs in one basket.

Then the miracle, all the baby boomers decided that it was much cooler to be seen driving a 4 x 4 than a luxury sedan. 

For Subaru who had been manufacturing all-wheel drive vehicles for years this was a very simple adjustment so the
Forester was born.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

For 2002 in order to keep up with the stiff competition in the 4 x 4 category, Subaru gave the Forester a good overall. 

Most of the major changes were done to the body, giving the Forester a sleeker and younger appearance.

With a new chromed front grill, new rear light reflectors and alloyed wheels the 2002 Forester does look much better than its predecessor does. 

It certainly is a change for Subaru to show some concern over the look and style of their products. Until the 2001 Forester, I really never was to impress by that aspect.

Driving this vehicle on the highway is a charm; you do not feel as if you are in a SUV at all. It has an excellent suspension and the interior is very comfortable.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The Interior:

As in the past, the interior of the Forester is as comfortable as an interior of a luxury sedan. I noticed in the 2002 model that the seats are superiors in quality than they were in earlier models.

Sitting behind the steering wheel, the driver will have easy access to all the gauges and controls. 

The forester 2002 is very well equipped and the one I drove
had all the bells and whistles you may desire.

The all around vision is excellent, especially with the side and rear view mirrors. To me this always shows that the manufacturer does care for the safety of their clients.

While I am on the safety subject, in recent collision test done by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Forester scored better than all the other sport SUV�s that were tested with it.

I was a little disappointed with the quality of the sound system. But I was immediately reminded that the vehicle I drove was equipped with the basic system and that any new owners can up-grade to a better quality at the time of
purchase.

The exterior:

I have mix feelings about the exterior of the 2002. I do like the new front grill and the new silhouette of the Forester but I find the large gray two-tone coloring at the lower part of the body to be very ugly.

Most of the changes that Subaru did to the Forester for 2002 are on the exterior of the vehicle. They have given it a sleeker look that is much more appealing to the eyes.

This gives the Forester a more modern and also a more competitive look.

The cargo area is not excessively large, but it is spacey enough for anyone�s weekend equipment and tools.

THE ROAD TEST

As I mentioned earlier driving the 2002 Forester on the highway is a real treat, aside from the fact that it sways a little when hit by crosswinds I found nothing wrong with it.

Driving it within city limits is not as good. Although you have an excellent all around vision it is still a large vehicle and it needs room.

I found the brakes to be somewhat spongy. Again I was told that a simple adjustment would take care of this problem. My experience is, that when a vehicle has spongy brakes, there is very little that can be done to remedy this. The driver simply has to adapt.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Forester I drive was as follows:

Engine: A 4-cylinder, 2.5 liters motor developing 165 horsepower.
Transmission: A 4-speed automatic transmission.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

I had the opportunity to drive the 2002 Forester for a whole weekend. It was a pleasure to do so. Aside from the soft brake pedal and at times wishing it had a little more power than 165HP I find nothing wrong with this SUV.
