            Almost four years ago my wife and I bought a 1991 Cherokee Limited from our local dealership.  We traded in our two swinging singles machines much the same as we traded in our swinging singles lifestyles, and compromised with the one gold on red beauty.  I say compromised because she dreamed of two additional doors to access our newborn bundle of joy in the back seat, while I still needed to hold on to some semblance of masculinity, which I found in the ability to move all four wheels with the torque-heavy 4.0 liter motor.  This was however, not my first experience with the station wagon on steroids.
  
Currently I am a near-graduating college senior (May '00). Prior my return to the life of textbooks and lectures, I was a fish and wildlife enforcement officer.  The work involved patrolling mud bogs and swamps that you wouldn't want to drive a Hummer (you know those supercharged all-terrain military trucks) through, and yet my fellow officers and I pressed on everyday in our off the showroom floor, unmodified grocery-getters.  It was a regular occurrence to have all four wheels off of the ground, or in muck up to the door handles while pursuing some poacher, and yet after a fill-up and a wash they were ready to go the next day.  In all that time and with all of that abuse, we found only two immobilizing faults with the trucks.  

The first one I found after filling one too many grand canyon sized potholes with my tires, and seeing in my rear view mirror what appeared to be a rain-soaked thundercloud pursuing my vehicle.  It seems that the transmission cooler lines ran right above the passenger side a-arm, and one of the times that I bottomed out, the lines were pinched causing fluid to saturate the engine block and burn hence the storm cloud following me.  The second fault with the Cherokee was discovered by a fellow officer when he attempted to drive through a creek too fast, oh yeah, when the small river was at flood stage.  We found that the engine air intake was located directly behind the driver's side headlight, and that it opened downward.  As a result of this design water was quickly ingested by the motor, and not digested.    

Our mechanic easily corrected the first defect by re-routing the cooler lines; Jeep also adopted this re-engineering in later models.  The second can be corrected with the purchase of an air intake extension that runs up the driver's side pillar next to the windshield.  It is available through Jeep or from most aftermarket Jeep parts dealers.  

These &quot;problems&quot; aren't an issue for the average Joe or Joan wanting a vehicle to get them to work during the week and to the slopes or mountain bike trails on Saturday.  If what you want is a dependable and versatile vehicle, this is the one!  The original design debuted in 1984 with the XJ models, add an airbag here and round off the edges there, and you have today's Cherokee Classic.  If you are in the market for an SUV, I don't think that you will find a more lasting and adaptable vehicle, and did I mention my wife likes the four doors.
