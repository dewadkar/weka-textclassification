            There's no question about it: This camera will be a little bit of an investment. However, we're not photographers, and we're pleased as punch with this camera. Picture quality is far superior to my 35-mm, and the ease with which you can transfer pictures to the computer makes this a great choice. The only drawback is that, because it's so expensive, we don't want to take it along on trips where it might get stolen or broken.

I've taken pictures in the dark before, just hoping I was aiming in the right direction, and the pictures turned out great. The zoom is wonderful; we've taken pictures about an acre away, and the subject looks like it's right in front of the camera - with no degradation! 

Memory capacity is wonderful - just get a memory card with the capacity that you need. The flash works great in any light. Battery life is acceptable; we just buy rechargeable batteries so that we can have spares on hand.

The only problem that we've encountered is when we first got the camera. We took a bunch of pictures, deleted some that we didn't want, and then took some more. Later, when we transferred the pictures to the computer, we discovered that the later pictures, though they existed on the camera, couldn't be seen by the computer. Customer support was nonexistent (they didn't even call us back), but we discovered that it was because we didn't reinitialize the memory card before taking pictures. Now, whenever we delete any pictures, we reinitialize the memory card before doing anything else. This means that we need to transfer the existing photos onto the computer first, so if you're going to be taking a lot of pictures at one time, it would be best to have a lot of memory cards on hand. But since we discovered this, we haven't had any problems.
