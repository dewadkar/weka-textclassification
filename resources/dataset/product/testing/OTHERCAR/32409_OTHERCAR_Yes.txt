            An M3 for us cheap skates.

While the car isn't quite as quick as I'd hoped, the engine makes the coolest race car-like noise that leads me to wind it up whenever possible.  And, of course, winding it up, you get going pretty good.. Which, by the way, is why they should probably include a good spanking with every purchase.  But I digress..

It's really quite the fun car: agile, decently fast, with a typical Honda ergonomically sound interior design, good looking on the outside, and, I expect, reliable as all-get-out.

My one complaint: the headroom needs some work.  I'm 6 foot, and it's a little tight, in fact, I have to tilt the seat back to feel comfortable.

But, when all is said and done, I get behind the wheel and enjoy the heck out of every drive.  If you pass a guy driving an Electron Blue Pearl one with a big, dopey grin on his face, that's me.
