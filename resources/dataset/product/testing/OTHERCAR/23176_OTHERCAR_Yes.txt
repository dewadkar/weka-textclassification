            There is a big difference between a $12,000 car and a $22,000 car. That difference is well demonstrated by the Accord V-6.  Sporting the same engine as the Acura Legend, this car has more than enough power, and comfortably drives 90 MPH on the highway.
 
If you currently drive a 4-cylinder, you will be blown away by the difference in acceleration.  The V-6 Accord moves easily from 60 MPH to 90 MPH on the highway.  The accelerator is very responsive at any speed.
 
The car is also well engineered.  The seats are comfortable, instruments and electronic controls are conveniently placed, and there are plenty of places to store your junk: cup holders, change holders, map holders, etc.  The interior is spacious and there is plenty of room in the back seat for two adults.
 
In addition to great acceleration, you get state-of-the-art engineering, a spacious interior, excellent resale value, and Honda reliability as a bonus.  Without a doubt, the V-6 Accord is the best value in its class.

Note: I did finally have a visit to the shop.  Around 58,000 miles, the Check Engine light flashed. The Accord needed some sort of exhaust part, which the dealer said was on &quot;international back order&quot;.  They said the part would arrive in three weeks, and it was okay to drive it until then.  All costs of this repair are covered under the original warranty.<br><br>
