            We bought the vehicle basically because we wanted a larger vehicle for our vacations, and neither our 4-year old VW Gulf nor our 1999 Sonata was quite large enough.  I was initially reluctant to get rid of a cheap, working, small car (the VW), that was very fuel-efficient and that I drove to work, so my husband did a lot of research, on and off the web, to find the equivalent in a new car. We looked at SUVs and wagons, and ruled out the former because of gas mileage, so focussed on wagons. We really like our Sonata, so my husband researched the Elantra wagon, and it looked good. We decided to buy it when we found out that the dealer would pay off our 1996 VW Gulf without charging a hefty down-payment or large monthly payments. 
   I love the fact that it uses as little gas as the Gulf, yet I am in a bigger car, and don't have to dance on the clutch in traffic.  It costs so little that the monthly payments are only a little more than we were paying our credit union for the Gulf, although I admit that we are leasing the car, not buying it.  The only thing I'm not wild about is the cup holder, which you push out to use. I like BIG cups for my drinks, and it's tough to get them in and out without spilling. We've only had the car a week, but it's looking good.
   I recommend this to anyone that wants a roomy, comfy car, and hates to spend a lot of money.<br><br>
