            I bought my 3rd Acura Integra one month ago today and still wonder why I haven't kept one since the first one I had in 1993.  I also have a Lexus, but it has been a money pit lately (reviewed on here also) so a 2nd car was in order.  The Acura I have gets 30mpg around town and 37MPG on the highway is easy to do even at 80mph cruising speed.  When gas was around $2.00 a gallon for super unleaded (Lexus had to have that stuff) it was really an easy choice to make.  HAD THIS CAR A YEAR NOW AND STILL ECSTATIC I BOUGHT IT.  ALSO SEE THE LEXUS UPDATE I'LL DO.

The Integra I bought last month is a 1989 LS 2-door.  It had 151,000+ miles on it, but it was in amazing condition.  I've put 800 miles on it already and I'm still convinced I made a wise choice.  I look for similar problems that I had with my other two Integra's and found none.  NOW IT HAS 166,700 MILES ON IT AND I'VE ONLY REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR AND DONE A MAJOR SERVICE.

THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR:

-- PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS.  IF THE BATTERY LIGHT AND HEADLIGHT MOTOR LIGHT START TO FLASH, THE ALTERNATOR IS ON IT'S DEATHBED.  I REPLACED MINE IN FARGO, ND ON MY 18 STATE ROAD TRIP, BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY PROBLEM I ENCOUNTERED.

-- TUNE-UPS.  DURING MY TRIP I GOT ANYWHERE FROM 31 TO 38 MPG.  AFTER THE MAJOR SERVICE TUNE-UP I NOW GET 33CITY, 41HIGHWAY, A BIG IMPROVEMENT FROM 29CITY, 38HIGHWAY.  VERY IMPORTANT TO DO WITH GAS PRICES ON THE CLIMB AGAIN.

-- the rear view mirror in all early integra's are rotten and they need to be propped in place with cardboard/paper/glue or whatever.  Honda of North America would love to sell you a repair kit for $60, but I doubt many people buy that.

-- The power steering system can be problematic if you don't put in genuine Honda fluid in.  This will cause the seals to break down and leak until the reservoir is dry and the rack needs to be resealed for $360.  I had that done on the 1988 car and the 1989 car just had that done a few months ago.

-- The factory installed cassette deck has problems after a lot of use of the tape player.  The band stretches/gets worn out and will not eject tapes after 'eject' is pressed.  But a pair of tweezers to get the tape out fixes that every time.

-- Instead of getting a tune-up when the MPG goes down.  Run the fuel tank down to almost empty and buy about 2 gallons of 100 octane (if available in your area) and go out on the open road going as fast as you feel safe doing.  This cleans injectors, etc and helps me to put off a tune-up a little longer.

--  Keep an eye out for the timing belt.  If it breaks while it's running, that's a easy $600+ repair job, and I hear Honda/Acura's never run the same afterwards.  On the early model Integra's a 10mm socket wrench is all it takes to take off the cover and look at it.  Replacing it as maintenance is about $350 (includes a new water pump too).

--  {on hatchback} the air shocks that keep the hatch up are $120 to replace, but a broom handle works just as well.

--  The heat shield between the car and the muffler has gaps that let gravel/rocks in.  The rattling is annoying as sin, but is an easy cheap fix.  I have another rattle in the engine bay that sounds similar, but haven't gotten to the repair shop yet to get it fixed. FIXED NOW, NO PROBLEM

--  Power sunroof is pricey to fix.  $188 for the motor and 3 hours of labor.  I may or may not get that fixed.  Summer is here in the desert, so I'm not going to bother until at least October.  NEVER GOT AROUND TO IT, DON'T REALLY MISS IT.

--  Tires are pricey for a car of this size, but good tires are worth paying a little extra for.  Michelin MXV's are the best for handling, wet, and dry traction.  But expect about $350 for a set of 4.

Maintenance in general should be kept up.  Acura's with 200,000 + miles are no big surprise.  Oil changes, rotate tires, timing belt replacement, etc.
