            I did not set out purposefully to acquire the 2001 Daewoo Lanos for my weeklong ride on a recent business trip to Las Vegas. I did seek out the lowest-cost car rental, and at $90 per week &#151 not counting the outrageous taxes they charge in Las Vegas &#151 the Lanos fit the bill. Overall, it is a fine cheap Korean car. 

From the outside, the Lanos had an interesting look. It is a somewhat muscular looking hatchback, sort of like a Honda Civic hatchback on a light dose of steroids. The fenders all had slightly menacing bulges and the car appeared to slope toward the front, as though the Lanos was just waiting to spring into motion. The 14-inch alloy wheels were a nice touch but the 185/60-14 tires just looked a little too small under the sheet metal.

The Lanos I rented was a two-door and the doors seemed big regardless of where I parked. I was always able to squeeze in/out without dinging the car next to me but it was close sometimes. The window in the rear hatch was quite small and this limited the view out the rear. The very loose rear-view mirror that threatened to fall off the windshield at any moment also did not give me a lot of confidence about my rearward view. The rear window has a windshield wiper, which seems like a useless feature in Las Vegas.

The car was painted in an attractive dark blue, although there were many swirl marks in its finish. The doors were fully framed and seemed sturdy, something I can&#146t say about my 1995 Subaru. The rear windows do not open in the Lanos.

The Lanos was fit up pretty well inside, including some things that are standard and some that must have been options. My rental had power windows and locks, a tilt steering wheel and an AM-FM/cassette/CD player that took up a lot of space in the dash but seemed well integrated. The radio had a tiny blinking red LED that may have been for some sort of alarm &#151 the car&#146s manual referred to it as the &#147security warning light,&#148 although I couldn&#146t find an explanation of what it meant.

The sound quality from the four speakers &#151 all of which are pretty small &#151 is average at best. The radio's FM reception was surprisingly poor.

The seats had the usual fore-aft and recline adjustments, and I did find a comfortable position. The tilt steering wheel let me find a spot where I had a clear view of the minimal gauges. There was just a speedometer, odometer, gas gauge and temperature gauge, in addition to a smattering of idiot lights.

The heater controls were logical and easy to reach, and the car&#146s A/C worked fine. The four dashboard vents do not have levers to shut off the flow of air at each vent&#133 all my cars do have such levers and this seems a really cheap way to skimp on the part of the Daewoo Lanos.

The car&#146s front seats tilt way forward to actually give decent access to the rear seats. I did have a full load in the car for one brief trip &#151 a total of four adults &#151 and everybody fit reasonably well. Two fairly small (both less than 5&#146 5&#148) women were in the back and they had room to spare. But this is a two-door car and access to the rear seat is not its strong point. While sitting in the driver&#146s seat, I needed the arms of a gorilla to reach behind for the seat belt.

The front seat was very firm and covered with a thin cloth that I thought would wear quickly. The rental car had 21,000 miles on it and the seats were still in good shape, so maybe the cloth is more durable than I think. I also thought the seat hardware &#151 particularly the hinge that allowed the seat to tilt forward to access the back seat &#151 was flimsy. I think this car would get pretty uncomfortable on a long trip but I was in it for no more than 15 minutes at a time. I got a strong static shock each time I got out of the Lanos, but this could have been the dry Las Vegas air.

There are few places to store things in the Lanos; basically, there is the glove compartment and each door has a map pocket. (This is, after all, a small car.) There is a two-container cupholder that pops out of the dash that holds only the smallest drinks.

Otherwise, there is lots of plastic inside without any real attempt to give a quality look and feel. The switches and controls all felt okay but the wall-to-wall plastic just has a cheap look.

Under the hatch is a decent little trunk that is covered when the hatch is down. The four adults pretty much filled the trunk with our large computer cases and a couple of small bags. I do not recall if the rear seats fold down to make more room but it would surprise me if they didn&#146t.

My Lanos had the optional 1.6-liter dual overhead cam engine, which is rated at 105 horsepower and 106 foot-pounds of torque. This doesn&#146t seem like a lot but the car weighs only 2,450 pounds, so there&#146s not all that much to move. My rental also had a four-speed automatic with a switch for a &#147sport&#148 setting that lets the engine wind a little higher before it lurches into the next gear.

The car started easily but had a screamingly fast idle most of the time, which made shifting into &#147drive&#148 a jarring experience. I didn&#146t want to keep the car in gear when stopped at a light because it strained against the brakes with its fast idle. Therefore, I put it in neutral at stoplights and jarred my teeth each time I shifted it back into drive.

The car had a rubberband feel as I accelerated. Stepping on the gas made a lot of engine noise without a lot of movement but speed seemed to come on the longer I pressed on the go-pedal. Each shift of gears in the four-speed automatic transmission brought a lurch that was very educational from the standpoint of knowing exactly when the car shifted. Between the strained-sounding engine and the lurching transmission, the normal acceleration that I did while driving around town was not pleasant.

The brakes &#151 front disks and rear drums &#151 worked pretty well but the pedal was a little spongy feeling. It wasn&#146t too bad though and the car always stopped with no problem.

According to the manual for the 2001 Daewoo Lanos, the car has a turning radius of 16 feet! I checked this by doing a U-turn at a light and was able to do a 180-degree turn in three lanes.

The Lanos had a very firm ride that did feel a bit sporty. There was some lean in turns but I could drive in a sporty manner if I was willing to ignore the whining engine and lurching transmission. The power steering was not overly boosted and had decent road feel. The front end clunked a bit going over the many speed bumps in the casino parking garages in Las Vegas.

I drove the Lanos about 43 miles and topped up the gas tank with 3.5 gallons, which is some of the worst mileage I&#146ve ever had in a car. (That works out to about 12 mpg!) I don&#146t think that all that gas was used up by the fast idle &#151 I have to assume that the car was not as full as it should have been when I picked it up at the car rental place.

Looking under the hood, the air filter and oil dipstick are easy to reach. The fuel filter is also under the hood but it&#146s in a place that would be hard to reach. Most of the wires and mechanical thingies were hidden under a plastic cover on top of the engine.

I&#146m glad that I had a chance to rent the Daewoo Lanos. My feelings about it are mixed: Except for the fast idle speed, which is a problem that can probably be fixed, it was actually better than I expected. But there is no getting around that this is a cheap car with only the faintest pretensions at being sporty.

The Daewoo Lanos was noisy, jarring and was filled with uninspiring plastic. It had overly firm, cheap-feeling seats and offered few places to store the sorts of things that you need to keep near you as you drive.

But as a weeklong rental that I never used for more than 15 minutes at a time, the Lanos was everything I needed in a rental car&#133 with the possible exception of its lousy gas mileage. Maybe if it were a nicer ride, I would have spent more time in it. But it got me where I was going and let me get out before anything major broke.
