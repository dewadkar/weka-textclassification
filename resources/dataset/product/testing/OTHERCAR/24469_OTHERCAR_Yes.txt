            Very difficult to compare this vehicle with others as I do not know of any luxury pickup truck which you can load up with mulch bags in the lined bed and later valet park at a 5 star restaurant with all heads turning. That's the beauty of this beast. Add a 6.0 V8 with 345hp and the fun really begins. I average 12.5 mpg but with its "30 gallon" tank I fill it 2X per month. Not bad considering I had a 4.3liter V6 which got 17mpg but with just 200hp and a 26 gallon tank. The longer suburban wheelbase of this vehicle makes it very stabile and with the center of gravity lower this handled better than the std Denali or Escalade. The rear seat can hold four 6 yr olds so don't see the need for a 3rd row. Yes you can extend the bed by lowering the midgate 3 feet to make this an 8ft bed(longer than a std 6ft pickup) but doubt I will ever do so.
The bed is wonderful as the wheel wells do not protrude inwards. There are also 2 side cargo areas which can hold ice and beverages making this a wonderful vehicle to take to the beach. Dash is typical GM pickup but with leather and real wood trim vs Denali plastic. The Bulgari clock is a nice touch. Didn't see that in the $73,000 Range Rover or $62,000 Porsche Cayenne. Bose stereo and Navigation XM radio really smartens it up. Very little cloth to fade or get dirty so I expect with care that the interior can go the distance. The removable hard cover bed tonneau panels are very nice as they can be removed one at a time to allow for tall loads. The 4 door crew cab has a roof rack on top.  I think GM knows that White diamond pearl metallic is a winner as it is the only paint which is an option and I love it. Doesn't get dirty looking that easy. Also the Chrome rims are just awesome for orginal equipment. BMW can learn here about brake dust. These rims stay clean a long time.

My only negative is that this vehicle is typical GM which means the transmission and engine are great but you will probably have 3 fit and finish things you will have to go back to the dealer to fix. I would expect more from a Cadillac but once you get beyond this it is an outstanding truck which you will probably always have while you turnover your sedan every 4-5yrs.

As for the AWD system it is smooth. No low gear but never really used 4WD low in my pickup even in the worst of blizzards.
