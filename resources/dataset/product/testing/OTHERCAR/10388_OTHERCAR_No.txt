                 I can not say that I know a lot about this car we only kept it for about 6 months the repairs got to be out of hand .also  my husband does work on cars for a living his dealership was thinking about buying into part of kia but not after talking to  the line techs who told them of the problems they have and that they spend a lot of time in the back being worked on .They are a value as far as paying out of pocket right away but in the long run when you total up the money spent on keeping it together you might find that there was not much of a value after all.The kia does have one thing going for it it looks great and I do see a lot of them sitting in the shop stalls waiting to be worked on .<br><br>
