            We just picked up this little digital camera, and for the price (on sale for around $300) we are very very impressed... The quality of the images is excellent. We have been doing a lot of camera research for a while now, and after reading some other positive reviews here on epinions decided that this would be the one to buy! 

The camera has five settings to take pictures.small 640x480 pixels (normal 106 images with jpg compression or fine 61 images with jpg compression ) large 1280x960 pixels (normal 43 images with jpg compression  or fine 23 images with jpg compression ).

I have taken some pictures to send my brother by email; for these I used large/fine with jpg compression/1280x960 setting. He tells me at the other end that it downloaded quite quickly.

The best image quality would be CCD RAW (1280x960 pixels) with no compression but with the flashcard that came with the camera I could only take two pictures!!  The flashcard is only 8meg but you can buy cards that are 48meg..

The zoom can be set from wide angle, 4.3mm (35 mm film equivalent: 28mm), to telephoto, 10.8 mm (35 mm film equivalent: 70 mm).
It has a video plugin to set it up to a VCR or TV.  You can edit the pictures right on the camera, delete the Images you don't want, view a slideshow of the pics you have taken..

I'm still going over the features of the camera....  I just got the drivers working today!!  I had to download the twain software for the S10... <b> this is the camera you should get!! </b> 

It's the newest mid-range canon digital camera.
