            My mother bought this Cougar new in 1995.  She's one of those people who has the oil changed because the calendar says it is time.  I bought it from her in 1999 when it had about 27,000 miles on it.  The car had never been to the shop for anything other than routine maintenance.

Now the car is showing 85,000 miles.  I had it checked out today, and the only thing wrong with it is it needs new spark plug wires.

There are two things I don't like about the car.  The first is is the gas mileage, but that's a trade-off for the powerful V8 motor.  (Yeah, I've met about all the state troopers in my area at one time or another.)

The second thing I don't care for is the leg room in the back seat.  It's fine for small kids, but grown-ups over 5'4" almost have to sit across the seat.

I love the car so much.  It has a cloth split roof, leather seats, and super shiny cream color paint job.  It still looks new after all these years.  Most people are amazed to hear that it is as old as it is.

This Cougar will stay in our family for many more years.  It's like owning a sports car with a family car insurance premium.
