            I purchased this product right before Christmas so that I could save all our Christmas photo's on disk and give copies to our family members.  This Camera is so easy to use that you basically load batteries, open the lens cover and start taking pictures. It has an option to set your flash on either auto, no flash, flash, or the &quot;red eye&quot; flash so you can take pictures in a variety of places.  The 2 meg disk that comes with the camera holds as many pictures as a roll of film or more based on your choice of resolution.  Instead of using the program that came with the camera to upload the pictures, I chose an alternative, The LEXAR smartmedia Digital Film Reader.  It works as a parallel port and with a short disk install, it works just like an additional drive on your computer.  This made  uploading pictures quicker and easier..
This camera is a must buy for anyone who knows very little about computers and computer peripherals.  I would also recommend the Digital film reader in addition.  Thumbs up! <br><br>
