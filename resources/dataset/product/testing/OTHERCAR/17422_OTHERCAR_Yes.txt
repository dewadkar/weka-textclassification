            I just turned in my 4runner after a lenghty lease and it was a very sad parting but it allows me to do an honest review. 

COMFORT and ROOMINESS:
Being 5'10" This truck seems as though it was designed for me ... everything fit. The controls were logical, anything mechanical operated flawlessly and was clearly built to last.  The back seat was as spacious as a Montana ranch. The only space issue I had was that any passenger over five feet tall was cramped in the front passenseger seat and The drivers seat didn't seem to go back far enough.

POWER:
I spent many a minute in prayer hoping that I wouldn't light this car on fire just because of it's gutlessness. My sisters Le'car had about as much "get up and go". So I guess the trade off for comfort is no power. But on the flip side it is one torquee S.O.B., so if you're going to tow with it you have no worries.

Handling:
Top notch, I've had this baby in hard turns going very fast and never once did it threaten to roll.

Overall a great truck and now that a V-8(2003)is in it I may get another.
