            When I wrecked my piece of junk Ford Probe in March of 1998 (see my review of that horrible car for more info!), I needed to buy a car.  Since I had never financed a car before and did not want to go too far into debt, I set my price limit at $10,000 figuring that I should be able to find a decent car for that price.  Since I was looking for more of a Sports car at that point, this proved more difficult than I figured it would be.

After deciding that I could not afford the insurance on a Sports Car, I found the Saturn SC2 which was a pretty decent deal in my opinion.  It has a sun roof, which is the next best thing to a convertible in Florida, and power everything which I thought was great.  It was 6 years old and only had 28,000 miles on the engine, which was great since it belonged to a little old lady who only drove it when she was in Florida for the winter, so I figured I was set.

First of all, if you have never had power accessories in a car (namely the seatbelts and Windows), don't get pulled over until you remember that you have them, or the police officer will assume you are drunk as you try to figure out how to open the window with the car turned off and then you keep choking yourself with the seatbelt as you reach for your gun...umm...I mean registration!  Trust me on this one!

ANYWAYS, the car was great, ran great, I had no problems.  It only had a 4 cylinder but with the Twin cam engine, it wasn't too bad, even if it was an automatic.  That is until the fan belt broke and smashed my crank shaft.  That was good for about $400 including labor.  No problems, I paid it and figured that was not my fault.  Of course, due to circumstances not under my control I didn't get to check the car out when I picked it up, and the automatic tensioner for the fan belt was broken.  BAM, I got dinged for about another $190 for parts and labor.

Now we are in April the following year, and I realized that my insurance had dropped when I turned 21 the previous May, so I started looking for a convertible again, and traded my car in.

As far as the Saturn, I loved it, had not too many problems with it, and I would recommend it to my sister!<br><br>
