            My wife and I were looking for a mini-van that wasn't a mini-van. Spending a good amount of time at the Chicago Auto Show several years ago, we decided that the Honda Odyssey would fit the bill. Since the purchase of the vehicle, we have experienced very little in the way of problems and providing normal maintenance. Last week, my wife was on her way home, traveling at highway speed when she heard a pop, then a vacuum sound, another pop, then her Honda died. Driving in the left lane in late rush hour traffic, her previous experience as a race car driver paid off big time. She managed to get over to the right shoulder without incident and call AAA. The van was towed to McGrath Honda in Elgin, IL.

My mission over the past decade, is to upgrade through my consulting and public speaking, the level of(or lack of) good customer service. In my opinion, customer service, while slick advertising tells us we have it, I seldom find it when trading in the market place. McGrath and Honda corporate, after this experience, may stand at the very top of great service!

The engine was blown! One of the two balance shafts went. We were told that even though the van was well beyond warranty, that Honda may do &quot;good will repairs&quot; if the vehicle had under 75,000 miles. 75,127 showed on the odometer. Repairs were being tallied indicating a potential bill of $8 - $10,000. Honda has autorized repairs to replace the engine (basically everthing under the hood)and provide 75% coverage of the cost. While we are not pleased about spending the amount we have to, Honda stood up for their vehicle, provided a loaner car and communicated throughout the process. 

The Honda Odyssey has provided great &quot;driveability&quot;, performance, comfort and more. We were anticipating trading in the Odyssey this May, 2000. We were looking at a variety of other vehicles to purchase, including the Mercedes ML-320. I am not sure that many other manufacturers would provided this great back-up. The Odyssey stands as our first choice. <br><br>
