            When shopping around for new cars last spring, the new Oldsmobile Alero caught my eye.  After antagonizing over the fact that it was made by Oldsmobile, i finally decided to take it for a test drive.  The result was the purchase of my newly found love, the Alero.

Why did I love this car so much?
 
1)  Style -- In my opinion, the Alero possesses a sporty, and sleek style,  as well as a touch of class, that surpasses all other makes and models in it's price range.  There are a variety of colors to choose from, along with a variety of accessories that enhance its appearance.  I do, however suggest keeping the rear spoiler, and either the chrome or aluminum 6-sided star rims.

2)  Fun to drive -- When I first sat in the Alero, I was instantly impressed.  The interior was put together nicely, and didn't look cheap.  Everything was easily accessible, and the seats were comfortable.  The ride was smooth, and relatively quiet.  What I loved most was the way I was jerked back in my seat as I laid into the gas.  This car can move!  This especially comes in handy on the interstate!  The Alero handles better than other cars I had driven in that price range.  Traction control and anti-lock brakes made for a worry free drive in the winter.  

3)  Reliability -- I have had the car for a little over a year, and have put almost 20 thousand miles on it.  The engine has just as much zip now than it did the day i drove it off the lot.  Other than scheduled oil changes, my Alero has not seen the repair shop.  

This car is great for anybody hoping to find a car with a sports car feel, but not the sports car price.  The Alero is also a classy looking car that I feel good about driving to formal occasions.  If a great car at a great price is what you're looking for, the Alero is for you!<br><br>
