            In 1993 I purchased my first Toyota 4-Runner, a stick.  After 50,000 miles, my search for a new SUV began.  I test drove a Nissan and a Jeep, but they did not compare.  I sold my car for a high price (Toyota's hold their value quite well).  I leased my second 4-Runner SR5 (automatic)  in 1997 and in one month, my 3 year lease will end.  Once again, I have test driven a Land Rover Discovery, an Infinity SUV and a Jeep, and my final decision is to continue driving a Toyota 4-Runner.  The gas mileage is liveable as compared to other SUV's (approximately $18. to fill up and go roughly 200-225 miles) This is a &quot;cool&quot; looking vehicle, if that is important to you.  I enjoy driving long distances.  My only complaint is when you need to have the back seats fold down, it requires too much effort and time to remove the headrests and find a place for them.  

If you like feeling the road and an overall heavier feeling, this is the only vehicle to drive.  It is not a luxury car, yet very comfortable.  I am about to enter into a relationship with my 3rd 4-Runner.  Obviously I love my Toyota.<br><br>
