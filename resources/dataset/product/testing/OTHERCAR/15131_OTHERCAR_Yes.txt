            If you've read my epinion on the Mooshmobile, you know how hard it was for me to have to replace that car.  If you haven't read it, go directly to that epinion, do not pass go, do not collect $200 (okay, you can collect the money).

However, the writing was on the wall (I didn't do it, Mom!) that I had to move on and buy another car.  Since I'm self-employed, and write off my miles, I didn't feel it was a good idea to buy a new car.  Instead, it's better to have a car that will depreciate less, and take the standard mileage deduction.  That's why buying a new car didn't enter into the picture (oh, and because I'm cheap and have no money).

Ten years ago, I owned a 1986 Grand Am, which I promptly totaled within a year.  I really liked that Grand Am, and always thought of buying another one, so when my sister-in-law was selling her 1996 Grand Am, I decided to buy it.  I've had the car since late February.

<b>Car Features:</b> The Mooshmobile II is a 1996 Grand Am 4-door SE Sedan with 3.1 V6 engine, dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, front-wheel drive, power steering, daytime running lamps, power door locks, power windows, fog lamps, vanity mirrors, remote fuel and trunk releases, is anyone actually reading this list of features?, air conditioning, tilt steering, intermittent wipers, cruise control, rear window defogger, 4-speed automatic transmission, AM/FM cassette stereo with 4 speakers, remote keyless entry, and P195/65R15 tires.

<b>Driving Excitement:</b> The 155 HP 3.1 liter V6 engine delivers plenty of power.  It does 0-60 in 9 seconds, and has plenty of punch for quick passing maneuvers.  The steering has a right sports car feel.  The ride is a bit rough, however.  Driving over bumps, potholes, and squirrels causes the car to bounce and shake considerably.  With 65% of the car's weight on the front axle, the car bottoms out occasionally in driveways, and there is noticeable body roll on sharp turns.  The 4-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly.  I attempted to find the car's top speed on a deserted country highway (kids: don't try this at home), but was disappointed to discover that the car seems to have a governor, limiting the speed to 105 MPH.  Up until that speed, the car was increasing speed steadily, but at 105 it felt as if the fuel injection system shut off to limit the speed.  I tried this test again with the same result.  I'm glad I found that out before trying to race the Wisconsin Highway Patrol�

The car is equipped with an &quot;Enhanced Traction System&quot; (ETS) that limits wheel spin, which is useful for slippery road conditions.  When it senses that one or both of the tires are spinning or losing traction, it kicks in, reducing engine power, and upshifting if necessary.  It is a nice feature, but the stupid thing is that the button to turn ETS off is on the shifting lever, and it is constantly turned off by accident during shifting or adjusting the radio.  There is a dashboard light that tells when ETS is off, and I'm amazed how often that light is on, sometimes when I can't imagine having bumped it (maybe the Mooshmobile's demons jumped ship� err� car).

<b>In the Cockpit:</b> One complaint some people have is the low seat position, but I still find it quite comfortable.  Since buying the car, I've driven the car 7000 miles, including trips from the Milwaukee area to Memphis, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Cincinnati (coincidentally, cities the Springsteen tour hit), and it was very comfortable even for those long drives.  The gauges are easy to read, and the controls are well placed.  The car has a console shifter, which took awhile for me to get used to after being accustomed to having a stalk shifter (when I first got the car, I often turned on the windshield wipers trying to shift into gear).  The climate control system is so simple to use that even George W. could figure it out (it's a joke!).  Now the important things: there are cupholders for both the front and rear passengers, a center console that opens up for storage, and several crevices and compartments for storing all the non-essential junk every car owner feels they need to bring with them everywhere they go.  The car has illuminated entry and four interior lights.  The power window controls are backlit at night, and the power windows have the &quot;auto-down&quot; feature (am I the only idiot who can never get this feature to work when needed?).  As in most cars in this class, the back seat is fairly cramped for adults.

One of my favorite features is the remote keyless entry for the door locks and trunk.  To me, this is the best technological development since Al Gore invented the Internet.  I never had this feature on a car before, and now I can't imagine living without it.  It's very convenient to be able to just push a button and have the doors unlock.  I use my trunk a lot, so I especially like being able to pop the trunk with the press of a button on the key ring.  The trunk is moderately big, but the poorly designed opening is high and narrow, which doesn't make it very accessible.  

<b>More Than You Ever Wanted to Know About the Headlights:</b> The car has daytime running lights which automatically turn on when the engine is started, and go off when the engine is turned off.  Showing that the car's IQ is several points higher than mine, it knows <i>when</i> to turn on <i>which</i> headlights.  During the day, the smaller headlights are on, and at night, the car knows to switch to the bigger ones. I like the running headlight idea in general, but I don't like that there is no way to turn off the lights while you are driving.  What this means is that there is no way to properly flash cars, warning them of a cop (flashing brights doesn't work because then people think they have their brights on).  As a true humanitarian, I always like to flash cars that are going into a speed trap.  One surprising thing I didn't discover until I did the voluminous research for this epinion is that actually there is a light switch.  While it won't let you turn off the lights while driving, it allows you to turn on the lights when the car is off or to turn on the main headlights during the day.

<b>Gas Mileage:</b> Since I live in the middle of nowhere, I do mostly highway driving, but I haven't been overly impressed with my gas mileage.  I've gotten between 24 and 32 MPG, with 28-30 MPG being the most common.

<b>Reliability:</b> According to the April 2000 Consumer Reports Auto Issue, the 1996 Grand Am has been less reliable than average for other cars from 1996.  The biggest reliability problems have been with the brakes, electrical system, body integrity, and hardware.  Areas in which the '96 Grand Am has had good reliability are the exhaust and body rust.

<b>A Free Tip For All Car Owners:</b> There are many great tips in auto owners manuals.  Here is the very first one from my owner's manual: &quot;Caution: You can lose control of the vehicle if you try to adjust a manual driver's seat while the vehicle is moving.  The sudden movement could startle and confuse you, or make you push a pedal when you don't want to.&quot;  Great advice!  I can't count how many times I've adjusted my driver's seat and became startled and confused.
