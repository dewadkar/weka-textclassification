            Recently, I decided I had had enough of my 1992 Honda, with its constant trips to be repaired.  After not so careful consideration, I made the rash decision to buy a new sports utility.  I confess, this is not something I need for off-road activities or anything of that kind.  The power of sitting high up behind the wheel of a beast intrigued me.  This decision ended up being one of my most intelligent ones!

When I pulled up to the Toyota dealership, I immediately spotted my beautiful car.  The 2000 Millenium Silver seemed to be the appropriate color considering the timing.  After test-driving it, I was in love.  The Limited 4-Runners offer the features of a luxury car with the size I wanted.  It is incredibly roomy, and offers a smooth ride.  This is something I did have initial doubts about.  

After two weeks of owning this car, I am still in my blissful state.  I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone perusing this class of cars.  Once you have this sports utility, you won't ever want a sedan or coupe again!  This is worth every penny!<br><br>
