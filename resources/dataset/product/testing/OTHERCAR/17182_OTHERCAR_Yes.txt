            My wife and I bought a '97 Maxima GLE (used) in 1999 with 7k miles on it.  I've always been a fan of the Maxima (being technically/mechanically inclined; please read on ;^), and my wife now is a fan due to her driving experience with this car.

At first glance, the Maxima appeared to be more expensive than other imports (especially, the Hondas that she was used to).  However, when I tallied up the cost of an equivalent Accord with a V6, leather interior, premium sound, etc., the Accord ended up being more than a couple thousand more than the Maxima.  See, you get more *standard* with a Maxima which makes it look more expensive when compared to other "base" prices.

We've got around 50k miles on it now.  The performance has been rock-solid.  The steering is easier but more precise than many mid-size cars.  Fuel economy has maintained at 32MPG highway, 28-29 city.  Brakes (although they squeak a little when applied) are not even close to needing replacement.

<b>There have been a few minor problems, I'll list them all here:</b>
1. In the beginning the dashboard on the driver's side "rattled" slightly when we would hit a bump (when you test drive a car at a dealer they are known to reduce the air pressure in the tires so as to smooth out the ride and also reduce the number of rattles - so this rattle started after I inflated the tires to the correct pressure after we purchased the car).  A spray of expanding household polyurethane between the dashboard and firewall (below the windshield) took care of this.
2. The brakes started "squeaking" after 30K miles - but there is no real problem with them and they appear to be able to last 20k+ more miles past our current 50k miles.
3. The "Service Engine Soon" light started blinking around 40k miles.  This was the carbon emission control canister valve (back by the gas tank on the driver's side) that needed replacement.  I diagnosed and replaced it myself - the part cost $35 (approx $170 for a dealer to diagnose and install).

So - the only "real" problem has been the canister valve which is now a known issue with the mid-to-late-90's Maximas.  I am an extremely picky owner with high expectations and standards, and so that's why I mention the slight "rattling" and "squeaking" - even so those problems wouldn't be issues to many people.

<b>Positives:</b>
1. Gas mileage for an engine of this power and a car of this size is excellent.
2. Stainless steel exhaust.
3. Power.
4. Sound System.
5. Solid construction; rigid frame, even with sun/moon roof.
6. Very good climate control.
7. Unsurpassed engine engineering (built by Nissan's Infinity division.  Fewer moving parts than any other V6; fluid engine mounts, one coil-per-cylinder, etc.).
8. Power, power, power (did I mention power?).
9. The engine is said to be "free-revving", meaning power on reserve, on demand.

<b>Negatives:</b>
1. No cup holders in the back seat.
2. A 40/60 fold-down back seat for trunk access would have been better than the armrest fold-down access panel.
3. The engine is said to be "free-revving", but the Maxima also seems to downshift one gear too many when pressed at highway speeds (not a problem for people who aren't lead-foots).
4. No "official" place for holding coins.

Seriously, give the Maxima a test drive.  You'll notice that it is a car that was meant to be a driver's car in the form of a family sedan.  I really do recommend it, and our next family sedan will be a Maxima.
