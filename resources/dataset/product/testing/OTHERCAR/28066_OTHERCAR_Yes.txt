The Chevy Impala. When shopping for a new car last year my family and I were looking at cost, safety, reliability and ride, in that order. We looked at Honda's, Toyota's, Ford's and Oldsmobile's. Then we saw the Chevy Impala. 

This is a car that is great for the family, and even more fun for the driver. 

The interior comfortably seats 4 and a baby seat (or 6 w/o the baby seat). The car came equipped with leather seats, wide buckets, fold down center consoles in front and back, as well as seat warmers up front and automatic 6 way adjustments (with adjustable lumbar support). This car harkens back to the BIG family cars of the 70's. 

The Impala's trunk is very spacious with a large opening so you don't have to scrape the sides to put in wide or deep cargo. The only obstructions in the trunk are the speakers and amp. The wheel wells are out far enough that they don't impede you from filling the back of the trunk with 2 full sized suitcases on bottom, and there is no impediment to more on top of those. 

The ride of the Impala is smooth, quiet and responsive. The car is not set up for a tight ride, but has no problems with curves and maneuvering. The only down side, coming from a motocross driver, is that the brakes seem a little soft for such a big car. The engine on the Impala is quick and strong. Press on the accelerator and you will find you are at 80MPH before you know it. 

All of the controls are easily accessible to the driver and passenger alike. Good sized and clearly marked, the controls are safe to operate at speed. Dials and readouts are clear and unobstructed. 

After over 50,000 miles on my Impala, we have had no mechanical issues. We get 32-MPG Highway and 26-MPG City. 

So, the Impala is a large car that has lots of space and power... the big surprise? The exterior size is smaller than many other cars in its class.. and is able to fit in tight places that many who own similar cars would not dare park.

This is one great car!!!
