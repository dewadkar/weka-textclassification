            We were 1700 miles from home and we needed a car that would take us about 2500 miles in two weeks, economically.  We rented a car from National Car Rental.  My husband chose this car because it so closely resembled a Toyota and thought perhaps it was built by them.


<b>Doors / leg room</b>
The car was white, four door.  I guess the back doors were made for the kids as no adult male could fit back there for long.  The reason I say this, is because I carry a clutch type purse.  It is perhaps 5" thick by the time I get my wallet and assorted papers inside.  When I first tried to fit my purse onto the rear floorboard, I was made aware of how much leg room there was NOT.  My drivers seat was all the way back, the way I normally drive.  I could move my seat up to make more room for the back seat passenger, but by then I would be too close to the wheel for my own comfort. My 6'3" son did spend the better part of one afternoon in the back seat, but I think he stretched his legs across the length of the seats.  The interior was grey cloth, bucket seats.


<b>Steering / mileage / door releases </b>
I DID like the steering wheel.  Unlike my Ford F150 with the big bulky bar across the steering wheel, this steering wheel had openings at the edges of the air bag compartment, so a more petite hand could easily control the steering wheel.  My husband remarked that the steering was VERY responsive, reminding him of a Toyota we rented about 4 years ago. Rack and pinion?  The engine is 1.8 litre, 16 valve. Gas mileage is 31 city, 38 highway. It took us about five gallons of gasoline to make the trip from San Francisco to about 20 miles west of Lake Tahoe, California.
The gas door is made of plastic, and can only be opened/unlocked by a lever at the left hand base of the drivers seat.  There is also a latch along side it to release the trunk.  I guess that is good AND bad.  If you have anything in your trunk, you need to be aware that ANY one can steal it just by pushing that lever on your unlocked car.


<b>Locks / windows </b>
Speaking of locks, there is a master control on the drivers door to lock or unlock all the door locks.  There were power control buttons on the drivers side to control all the windows.  The first time I needed to roll down my window, I had a dickens of a time trying to figure out how to roll it up again.  I thought perhaps the button rocked back and forth.  Instead, you need to pull the button up with your fingertip.  I am sorry if I am telling you things you already know, I haven't had power windows in MANY years.  It is a frill you can really get used to.

<b>Comfort</b>
We spent quite a bit of time in this car, driving it from Spokane, to San Francisco, to Lake Tahoe, then back to Spokane, in about a week's time.  Unfortunately, I noticed my right knee, my gas control knee, aching after about two hours of driving. I've done quite a bit of driving in my day, and make a 500 trip at least once if not twice a year.  My knee has never ached while driving.  I was wondering if perhaps it was because of the way the seat  supported my leg. I discovered a day or so before we returned the car, that it was equipped with cruise control, that we didn't use. As well, my bum was sore after several hours of driving.  It was even sore for a couple of days after our lengthy driving ended.  I guess the seats could be a bit softer.  This shouldn't be a concern if all you do is city driving. The windshield wiper is three speeds, fast, slow and intermittent.

<b>Performance / gas gauge</b>
Speaking of city driving, we tended to put this car through its paces driving on the hills of San Francisco and the lengthy highway driving, including mountains. The car held its own getting up those steep San Francisco hills, although I truly felt sorry for it.  I suppose it could have had a bit more power, but at no point did I feel this car, with its automatic transmission, was going to fail in its mission to climb those hills.  I DID notice, that while climbing the hills the gas gauge tended to show a lower level of fuel.  This corrected itself when we were on level ground.  Speaking of the gas gauge, I noticed that it took a couple of minutes for the amount of fuel in the tank to register on the gauge.  It was unnerving to fill up a tank, drive away, and see your gauge very close to where it was when you stopped in for gas. There is a gas cap holder on the interior of the gas door. Both this door and the bumpers are made of plastic.

<b>Interior</b>
Starting at the dash, there are four air conditioning vents on the dash board.  Our car had a CD player as well as am/fm stereo. The sound was good for the radio, we didn't plan on the CD player so we didn't bring any CDS along.  I liked the LED clock which was the correct size and location for easy viewing. There is also a little coin holder on the dash for tolls and parking.

There was an automatic transmission and I realized I could not take my keys out of the ignition until I had put the car in Park.  Normally driving a stick, this took a little getting used to, but I learned quickly. Behind the automatic transmission, or closer to the back, was a pull - up parking brake.  Behind this, was a 3x5" (approx) compartment where we tended up hold our 20 ounce pop bottles. This area tended to be a little too far back to be ultimately convenient.  There was a cup holder for the rear seat passenger on the back of the transmission assembly.  There is a little hole by the parking brake, perhaps 1"x5"x3" deep where I tended up put my pop bottle tops. There was an additional coin holder here too.  The official cup holder was just below the radio and would have been in the way.

The car we rented had 14,000 miles on it when we returned it.  On the way to National Car Rental, we discovered the speedometer had stopped working.  The odometer still worked, just not the speedometer.  I am not sure if this may have been caused by us taking a dirt/rock road with 6" weeds tickling the underside of the car for 1/2 mile each day or not. Ordinary road noise was minimal, however those weeds sure made their presence known, loudly, on the bottom of our car.  

All in all, I am pleased with the car for the length of time we used it.  It had a great turning radius, making it easy to pull u-turns in the middle of the street, or eek into that tight parking spot.  I am disappointed by the comfort level when driving long distances. (The passenger side seemed to have plenty of leg room.) I also think that 14,000 miles is premature for the speedometer to quit working.  I am glad I didn't have to negotiate any tight mountain turns, unaware of my speed.  It would be equally scary going 90 mph on some of the straight aways and not even knowing it. 

Would I rent this car again?  Perhaps if I only had city driving to do. I wish you my best if you are vacation bound.
I didn't buy this car, but a price is required.  I put down what the car might sell for.

Thanks for reading.
