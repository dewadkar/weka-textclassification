            HIT or MISS....The dodge durango is my first SUV i have ever owned.  Like most buyers out there i shopped around other dealerships... got prices, test drove all makes and models and ended up buying the durango.It's been almost two years since we first drove off the lot with it.Each day we grow happier and happier with it. I have to admit there are some good points and bad points with the durango.As i drive down the road and look at other SUV's styles and the way the durango looks from the outside makes me glad i own it.Our SUV came with dual air and we live in North Carolina and the summers get very hot. Spend a few extra dollars like we did its well worth it.Next we got the third row seating so our SUV seats 7. We don't have 7 in our family but driving to Florida last summer with the whole family was more enjoyable with all the extra room we had. Our SUV came with the bigger tire package. It just looked better with the bigger tires and the rims looked nicer. The trade off with bigger tires is there is more road noise going down the highway. If you have never driven an SUV you'll notice how stiff it drives. It's more like a truck than a car. With gas prices as high as ever all i can say is you get what you pay for. I don't mind filling up the tank because driving it is such a pleasure.<br><br>
