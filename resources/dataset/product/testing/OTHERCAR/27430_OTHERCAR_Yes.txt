            I bought the 1995 dodge neon as a used car with 64,000 miles on it. In the past 2 years I have put over 70,000 miles on it myself. While this car is very reliable and has very good interior space; I should know I am a nanny and drive with 1 booster seat and one infant seat in the back. However, the car is very noisy, especially on the freeway! The car windows are not fully secured into the car when rolled up so wind does get in, making the car cold and even noisier. The car is very easy to handle and everything is close enough to the driver to be considered convienent. There are two main failures to this car: the headlights and the brakes. The headlights are more like fog lights which make it very difficult to see at night. The brakes are very weak and it takes alot to stop the car. The brakes also lock up very easily. I would recommended this car to anyone who needs a little more space in a compact car.<br><br>
