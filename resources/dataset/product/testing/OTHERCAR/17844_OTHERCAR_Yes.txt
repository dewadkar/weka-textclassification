            3 years ago I considered buying a GMC Jimmy ( a Blazer with a different grille).  So I rented one while my wife and I looked for a house.  At the end of the day both of us would feel slightly car-sick, as if we had been on a slow trip through winding mountain roads.  It was nice enough on the inside, but that truck ride...

The 2000 Blazer is a huge improvement over the old.  The ride is actually pleasant. Recently I had to drive on one of the nations busiest freeways, the San Bernardino (I-10). It was Friday.  It was 4:00pm, and it was the week before Christmas. Stop, go, stop, go. 30 minutes of this.  But no car sick feeling. 

Inside the Blazer is full of storage spaces and little cubby holes. There is always a place for your wallet, cell phone, drinks, change, and anything else you can think of. There are even drink holders built into the back doors, for the rear seat passengers.  The 60/40 split rear seat is very useful as is the 2-way rear hatch. Open just the glass for light stuff, or open the whole (heavier) door for the bigger items. The dash mounted hatch release is a thoughtful touch. Better than average stereo, at this price a multi CD changer would have been nice.

On the down side, the A/C and ventilation controls are rather confusing.  I still cannot figure out how to run fresh outside air through the dash vents, without running the A/C.  Maybe I should read the manual, but should I have to just to use the vents?  GM claims 190 hp from the 4.3L  
V-6, but it feels like less.  There is power there when you need it, but I feel as if I have to really stomp on the gas to get it.  

Clear useful gauges, nice smooth automatic transmission, comfy seats and plenty of cargo room. Why then the cheap plastic on some of the interior pieces?

 July, 2000 -- Chevy has just built a special edition Blazer called the &quot;TrailBlazer.&quot;  Essentially the TrailBlazer is just a Chevrolet Blazer with every option added.  TrailBlazer gives you:  On-Star, CD changer with Bose stereo, two tone leather seats, touring suspension, Home-Link, power front seats with memory, fog/driving lights, climate control, special logos inside, and gold trim outside (gold trim is icky).

The TrailBlazer is still a good car, as the Blazer it's based on is pretty good. The TrailBlazer rides and drives just like regular Blazer. The problem is that the TrailBlazer is $33,000.  And gold trim??  No way !
Stick with a regular Blazer, get the options you want, save some money.
