            Well after looking at others reviews, I can only say that they don't know what they are talking about.  Not to insult anyone, but this really is a nice camera.  For $85 this camera is great.  It takes nice quallity photos and doesn't cost anything to have them developed.  This camera has a variety of excelent features.  The flash timer on the camera.  The ability to hook up to the T.V. and display your images.  Personally I needed a camera to sell things on ebay.  With a quality picture this turned out Ive made a couple hundred $.  It has payed for itself 3 folds.  I really think this is a nice quallity camera for the money you spend. I can't really say much more.  Yes a $300 camera would do a higher quality picture.  But it petter or else why pay the extra $220.  If you want a quality camera for a fraction of the price then this camera is for you.

                                                              Go School<br><br>
