            I'm not even going to pretend to be anything but a rank amateur in photography. "Point and shoot" describes what I aspire to because sometimes I don't even get that right.
I got the Coolpix 2500 in May '02 (and boy, have prices plummeted) for the primary purpose of taking pictures of dark-faced dogs (Newfoundlands) in action, then uploading them to my computer, and wanted something small I could fit in my pocket that had relatively decent resolution.

It fits in my pocket just fine. The card that came with it, 16MB, lets me take the amount of pics I want to at a time,ie 16 at high resolution, which is all I ever used (who knows when you'll take that shot of a lifetime?). I've had it with me for 6 hrs and the battery never even got low, but mostly I had it set to automatically turn off after 20 sec. When I came home, I'd pop the battery in the adapter that came with it and was ready to go for the next time. 

Reading the instructions (which I prefer to avoid)about how to upload the pics to my computer gave me a headache and caused me distress. When I whined about it to the guy at the camera store, he was happy to sell me this little gizmo for $20 called a SanDisk, Compact PC Card Adapter, which made uploads a breeze. Highly recommended.

I couldn't care less about movie capability and a bunch of strange settings which I don't know what they are anyhow, so I never bothered with any of that. I did venture into night time settings because this thing does just middling in semi-darkness, but found they're real slow. If it's moving, you'll get blurs. It's also got a slow shutter speed, I guess that's what it's called, the time between when you push the "go" button and when it takes the picture, so it's a bit lacking when it comes to action shots. You'll get a nice, crisp pic but maybe not what you'd intended. The basic operations were fairly easy to master and use, as were the controls.

I was suprised at how much I missed having an optical viewfinder. The LCD screen is hard to see in daylight(a hood is available as an extra option) and I didn't like having to use it at the best of times. Seems unnatural to me somehow. It's fine for reviewing what you took, though, showing it to others and deleting the crummy ones.

Other reviewers have mentioned how fragile it seems but it never felt that way to me. However, I left it on the coffee table the other night and the cats got a hold of it. They took it apart, scattered the pieces throughout the house, broke some little thing-a-ma-jig and now it doesn't work anymore.

As far as red-eye goes...if that means the "I've been eating plutonium" laser eyeball glow, I got that also, with night shots.It's not the same real red eye bit as with my 35mm camera and I usually didn't get it if they weren't looking directly at the camera.

It does take nice pictures. I blew some up to 8 X 10 and they looked fine to my uncritical eye. I was real pleased with how I could take pics of old photos or book pages with the zoom real tight and have them turn out so well, and it allowed me to take distance shots with better results than I expected. I suspect that's common to most digital cameras, though.

It looks sleek and the swivel serves to protect the lens, or so they say. Although I managed to scrape it anyway, it hasn't seemed to affect the pictures, so maybe just a cosmetic defect. The swivel wasn't especially useful to me for angles; by the time I moved the swivel, whatever I was trying to aim at had moved too (dogs usually), so it was quicker to move me instead.

Overall, I'm not entirely happy with it. If I can get it fixed for a reasonable price, say $30, I'll stay with it. If not, I'm getting something else, maybe the Kodak LS420 that a friend has that takes better shots of black dog faces, even at night.
