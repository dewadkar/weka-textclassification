            I've owned my Saab 9000CSE for almost 4 years: bought it used in 1998.  There are some things that are great about this car.  First, the cargo area.  Since the car is a hatchback, you can fold the back seat down and get an amazing amount of stuff in the back hatch area.  Almost like a station wagon without the look of a station wagon.  The new Saab 9-5s are sedans, not hatchback, so you can't fit as much into them.

The turbocharged engine provides great acceleration up ramps and hills, and the heated seats are great in winter.  The controls are all very comfortable.  The cabin is plenty big, and even six foot tall people can sit comfortably in the back seat.

On the negative side, repair and maintenance is very expensive.  Any extended warranty is a definite plus.  Most of the things I had fixed were covered by the warranty, but not all.  Also, the direct ignition cassette reportedly fails frequently on this car, so see if that's been replaced.  Mine broke and I was unable to start the car.  The temperature gauge also gave me some problems.  Body parts are also expensive: I was in a wreck (not my fault!), and the headlight cost about $800 to fix, as there are little wipers on the headlights and expensive parts.

However, these cars aren't that expensive, and they give you a luxury car, and lots of space.
