            The Chevrolet Camaro is to large to compete with all the other sports cars in the $10,000 to $20,000 price range.  Due to this fact General Motors is going to stop production of the camaro and its counterpart the Pontiac Firebird.  You will more than likely see one last body change for the car, probably around late 2001.  More people prefer the small stylish looks of the Mustang.  I hate to say it but the Mustang will usually outrun the camaro as well.  The camaro is American made but that evidently doesn't affect the average buyer because sales are down for the Camaro and the Firebird.<br><br>
