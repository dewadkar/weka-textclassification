            The Geo Prizm is a great car. Although it's an American car, it's modelled just like a Japanese car, in particular the Toyota Camry or Corolla. You'll notice it shares many of the same features and also the same reliability of these cars. Buying a Geo, much like buying a Toyota, means never having to deal with bothersome repairs. It's inexpensive, well-built, comfortable, fun to drive, and a great all-around car. I bought a used Geo and in 16,000 miles I've had no problems. My brother's a Chevrolet mechanic and he describes the Prizm as &quot;flawless.&quot; And if you think a Toyota is &quot;cooler&quot; than a &quot;Geo&quot;, then take comfort in this: most people mistake my Prizm for a Camry, a much more expensive car. The Prizm is smooth to drive, but not too smooth-it doesn't give you that queezy floating-on-air feeling that some luxury cars do, but it's still a very comfy ride. Anyone should buy this car, even if you have the means to buy a much more expensive one. Why waste money on luxury, when you can get a comfortable, reliable, reliable, reliable car and use your  money in a wiser fashion? P.S. Go for the sun roof, you'll never go back.<br><br>
