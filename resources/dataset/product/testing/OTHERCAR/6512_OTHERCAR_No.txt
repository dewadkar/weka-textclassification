            We bought a 91 Mercury Sable for 5,000 in 1997 and I didn't expect it to be a perfect car but I expected to get what we paid for it out of it.  We had to replace the brakes shortly after having it which is no big deal but after doing that everything seemed to go wrong.  Next it started over heating and shutting off.  We then changed the thermostat and that didn't work.  Then is was found out to be the transmission.  We were able to drive it for a few miles before it refused to shift automatically and would have to pull over and let it cool.  We changed the tranny filter and it was full of metal.  We then alerted the dealer as we were upset cuz we only had it for 6 months.  They then told us that they had put a rebuilt transmission in it right before we bought it.  Needless to say we were very upset as we would have never bought it if we had known.  We were very lucky that the rebuilt transmission was under warranty so we didn't have to pay out of pocket but we were without a car for a whole month as the dealer had stopped giving loaners out.  We got it back and it was never right.  It wouldn't shut off when we wanted it too.  I was very nervous about this as we have three children.(we
bought a different car after that)  Then the whole power steering went and we had to pay for that.  The back brakes fell apart.  I mean we heard scraping really bad and come to find out it was because the springs from the brakes had come apart and nothing was holding the brakes together.  I will just say that this car was a huge disappointment to us.  I would recommend asking all you can about a this model and make.  I strongly recommend not even buying this kind at all no matter of the year.
