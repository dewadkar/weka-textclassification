            I purchased my VUE in November. I was looking at the Escape and Liberty but the dealer's were not giving any incentives or 0% financing so I went with the VUE. I got the basic model, manual transmission, no power etc. Its silver with the side running bars, front silver brush bumper and pin stripping. The exterior styling is really good looking and I'm going to purchase a nose bra and mud flaps which will add to that look. The handling around curves and at the mall is car like plus there's no stepping up to get into the SUV. I especially like the interior room and fold down rear seats. Fits a basic kitchen cabinet in it with no problem. That's the good. The bad, having trouble with the manual transmission already, 2100 miles so far. I commute 60 miles one way on the highway and the engine noise and wind noise is a little too much. Seating is good but I thought the fabric could be upgrade some. Too much interior plastic especially the center console. I had to take apart the top of the driving display and spray silicone on the plastic to stop some annoying rubbing noise.
