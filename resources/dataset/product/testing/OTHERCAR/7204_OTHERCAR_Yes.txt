            Late in the summer of 1998, my wife and I were walking through an auto tent sale at the local fairgrounds.  We rounded the corner of a tent, and sitting there was this riveting automobile.  All rounded yet sharp-edged, this was our first exposure to Ford Motor Co's &quot;New Edge&quot; styling:  The Mercury Cougar.

Fast-forward to early 1999.  We're shopping for a European sedan, but we've heard from several sources that the Ford Contour is &quot;A 3-Series BMW for under $20,000.&quot;  Immediately after test-driving a BMW 323i sedan, we drove to the Ford dealer to try a Contour for comparison.  Alas, we were ignored by all life-forms there.  However, since the Cougar shares the same platform as the Contour, we drove to the Mercury dealership and wrangled a test-drive in a V-6, 5-speed Cougar.

Upon climbing into the Cougar, you realize that you sit <i>low.</i>  This is no sedan, mind you...you're in a <i>sports car</i> -- at least that's what the seats tell you.  The interior is finished in decent-quality vinyls and plastics.  Not of the same quality as the Bimmer, but on the other hand, the BMW doesn't list for about $17,000 like the Cougar.  The seats were comfortable and supportive, though rather thin in the padding material.

Pulling out onto the road, the Cougar zips to speed easily.  The V-6 is Ford's 2.5-liter Duratech unit, and makes 170 horsepower -- the same number as the 323i's inline-six, coincidentally.  In the SVT Contour, this motor is massaged to produce 195 hp.  The motor pulls strongest at higher RPM's, with a noticeable surge of power as the tach needle passes 4,000 RPM.  An interesting experience is to put the Cougar in third gear at about 25 mph and stand on the gas.  The engine emits a stirring growl, and the speed builds to about 65 mph with a shrieking rush at the end.  The motor isn't silky smooth like the Beemer's turbine-like I-6, but rather seems to say, &quot;Hey, I'm a <i>sportscar!</i> Work me a little!&quot;

You'll know whether you like the Cougar's suspension within 15 seconds of hitting your first bump.  It's stiff.  Harsh, in fact, with a fair amount of &quot;jiggle.&quot;  It rides like...well, like a sportscar -- or at least what Ford Motor thinks a sportscar rides like.  There is no compliance to this car at all, and if your town's roads are at all rough, you might need a football mouthpiece.

Wait until your first stretch of open highway to make up your mind, however.  In fast sweepers like freeway onramps, this cat clings <i>hard</i> to the road, easily handling as well as the BMW 323i we tested.  As the speed climbs to 70 or so, the suspension comes into its own and soaks up the bumps and freeway joints.  The motor is noisy, but not intrusively so...rather almost joyously noisy at getting to run for a while.  Passing through 80 mph, the <i>oomph</i> has been replaced by mere acceleration and the engine starts to sound rather wheezy, where the BMW is still pouring it on, and doing it without complaint.

Unlike the BMW, though, the Cougar is fun to toss around in tight quarters such as parking lots and subdivisions.  It has a quick steering ratio and an easy-to-use clutch and gearbox, as opposed to the Bimmer's autobahn-tuned setup.  While the BMW's heavy racing-like clutch, solid shifter throws and slow-ratio steering feels stable and sure on the freeway, the same setup makes the car feel simply heavy and high-effort in town.  The Cougar, with its flyweight clutch pedal and responsive steering, is a joy to toss between lanes and around city corners...assuming that the aforementioned buffeting from potholes and manhole covers isn't a problem.

So in the final analysis, does the $17,000 Cougar handle and accelerate as well as the $27,000 323i?  Yes.  Is it <i>as good</i> as the more expensive car?  No, not even close.  Compared to the BMW, the Mercury lacks refinement, luxury, smoothness and a bit of quality.  What the Cougar IS, in my opinion, is a VERY good $17,000 sportscar, and possibly the best Mercury made in the last 15 years.<br><br>
