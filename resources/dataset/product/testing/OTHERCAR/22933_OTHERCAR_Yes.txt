            My purchase of a Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham (1989 edition) was the result of my previous car being stolen.  What luck!!!  Due to this turn of events, I became the proud owner of one of the FINEST works of automobile genius ever.  This car offers everything a person could possibly want, with the exception of fuel efficiency.  Hey, in a perfect world, every car would have all the features of the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham AND have great mileage, but it ain't a perfect world.  Anyways, this baby's got really nice leather seats, a cool horn, a motor that makes a lot of noise if the muffler falls off (mine did, but i put that sucker right back on), OPERA LIGHTS, and a trunk large enough to accommodate several whales/small cars.  If all of this doesn't seem like reason enough to cop this joint, remember that it comes with 4 lighters and a LEATHER OWNER'S MANUAL!!!!  I was sold the instant I saw this thing.  A definite buy in my book.
