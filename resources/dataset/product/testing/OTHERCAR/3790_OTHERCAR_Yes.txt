            The new E46 BMW looks darn nice!!! It was shown at the Frankfurt auto show this year and hopefully will be North America by 2001.  A promising 360 hp engine with a 6 speed manual has replaced the North American 240 hp engine.  Power Galore!  I would give this car a 10/10 for performance, but however, hopefully the price sticker won't be to large!  The new M3 takes its position like previous years as a &quot;modified&quot; 3 series with just about everything changed:  M engine, M drive train, M transmission; M design includes an M interior (seats, dash, etc.), M side mirrors, M body kit, M 18 inch alloy wheels, aluminum doors (reduced weight).  A true balance between performance and prestige!<br><br>
