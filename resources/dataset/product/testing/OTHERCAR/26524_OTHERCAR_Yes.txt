            In the latter part of 1999 I went to my local GM dealership with the intent of getting a 2000 model S-10 pickup.  Personally I am very particular about what I drive, and could not find a S-10 equipped the way I wanted it, so I ordered one.  About six weeks after ordering my truck i received a call from the dealer telling me &quot;come pick up your truck, it's here.&quot; From the time I set eyes on it I was in love.  I ordered a 2000 reg. cab sportside clad in space blue metallic, with the edition of the sport package and the H.O. 4.3.  It's been over a year now with no major problems.  Currently an A-arm bushing in the front end squeaks, the pump for the washer fluid doesn't work, at high speeds (85-97 mph) with the A/C on there is a chirping in the right vent on the center of the dash.  Other than that I have been VERY happy with the truck.  With the edition of the sport package (which lowers the whole vehicle 2&quot;, get a rear sway bar, larger front sway bar, anti-hop shock in the rear, stiffer shocks, and the way cool looking Iroc wheels of a 1992 camaro), and the V6/5spd the thing is a blast to drive.  Friends of mine that have Z28 camaro's are shocked at how I can keep up with them on windy country roads, and not fall too far back when drag racing.  Admittedly I am a bit fanatical about my vehicles.  Only using super unleaded, fully synthetic fluids, and washing it very regularly, but hey, if you love your vehicle as much as I do you understand.  On top of everything I get pretty much exactly what the window sticker rates on gas mileage, 17-23 so I'm not complaining     <br><br>
