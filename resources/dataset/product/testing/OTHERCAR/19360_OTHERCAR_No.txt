            This car was thrust upon me when my father in-law passed away. I found the exterior styling and fit and finish to be very good, but the interior styling didn't match my tastes at all. The eighties style speedometer and faux wood dash seemed out of place in such a comfortable and competent full sized sedan. The cloth power front seats were not very supportive, but comfortable, and my crew had more than enough room in the back seat to stretch and occasionally kick, smack and pinch one another. The remote fuel filler door and trunk release buttons hidden in the glove box was a nice touch. Although the car was extremely dependable during it's stay in my driveway, I never really looked forward to driving it. The suspension felt floaty over anything but perfectly flat pavement, and when applying the brakes the car had a tendency to want to stand on it's two front tires. Although it is a front wheel drive setup, wet weather handling was less than acceptable. This may be in part because of the bargain basement radial tires that were on the car at the time. I consider myself to be a car nut, but this particular vehicle was not able to push my buttons. I had heard nothing but good things about the drivetrain (3800 V6 and 4 speed auto) and I would have to admit that the engine and transmission were trouble-free for the time that this Buick was in my driveway. The V6 was up to the task of propelling the Buick with authority and was very smooth and quiet in the process. The first time raising the hood to check the engines vital fluids was interesting. The hood opens Corvette-style from the wiper blade area. The automatic climate control was kind of gimmiky, but it seemed to do an admiral job of keeping the temperature within the car at a reasonable level. And I could never get used to the auto load-leveling suspension compensating for the $200 worth of groceries that would be plucked from the trunk after an extended visit to the grocery store. Buick made the right choice in retiring the Electra name. They had basically the same car for sale in the Lesabre. The bottom line is this car should have been retired several years prior to this model year.
