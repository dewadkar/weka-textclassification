            The J30 luxury sedan provides performance, power, and luxury in a cheap package. The J30 produces 222 hp and uses the same engine as the '90-'96 non turbo 300Z's. If you have ever driven a Z you will know that it is extremely fast. Combine that power and put it into a four door luxury sedan and you get the J30. If you cannot comprehend this power a good number to know would be that it goes 0-60 mph in about 6.7 seconds. 

The J30 is for those who want a great looking luxury sedan that actually goes fast. The sleek design of the J30 makes it one of a kind. The rounded edges and corners of the provide a look of absolute speed and uniqueness. The J30 is for anyone who wants to get a used luxury sedan without paying a lot. The J30's range from 15k to 25k depending on which year you get. All the years it was made there were no changes made to the vehicle. Choosing your color would be the only thing left to do. The J30 is comparable to BMW's but actually has a better design if you compare to other BMW's in its value class. It also performs better than most luxury cars in its class including the BMW 323. The interior is roomy and is perfect for those who want an inexpensive family car or a car for themselves that comes in a sedan model.

The J30 is not recommended for big families. The interior is just perfect for a family of four, any more would make the space cramped in the back. The J30 also did not come in manual model for those out there who desire to shift through all the gears. <br><br>
