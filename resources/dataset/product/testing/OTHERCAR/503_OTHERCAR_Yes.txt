            I bought a 1994 Pontiac Bonneville in 1997.  My other car which was a 1987 Chevrolet Celebrity which was a very reliable car as I put 249,000 miles on it and it became history.  At that time I was very desperate to find a new car right away instead of renting one.  I went to various dealers and this Bonneville just attracted my eye.  Knowing myself, I am a very picky car buyer and a car freak.  I took this car for a test drive, as I love big cars and this really did satisfy my thirst for speed and handling. So I thought, I never would own a Pontaic.  

Since I bought the car, I ran into a serious engine overhaul repair which required a brand new engine replacement.  After the engine had been replaced, about 8 months later, I ran into exactly the same problem. This time they had to replace another brand new engine.  Luckily I had warranty on it at those times, still.  I was really tempted to trade in for newer car, but my budget wouldn't permit me.  However since they put in that last brand new engine, I was convinced that it was the best engine than the first and second.  I just somewhat decided to stick with it for a while since it handled much better like driving a brand new car.

It has so much room, that I even have lots of my friends ride in it with me and they always complimented on the handling and smoothness.  Even the interior really makes a big difference as it looks like I am driving an airplane. I have to admit that I have become very spoiled by the power features it has to offer from cruise control to radio control on the steering wheel.  

Not only that, my friend also bought a 1993 model too.  We compared notes and how much he liked it too.  The only thing we agree on is that the only negative impact it has are the gas mileage.  It really drinks up a lot of gas while driving in the city, especially Los Angeles.  However it really is good on long road trips and it even at times exceeded 400 miles one way per gas fill.

Another thing - the remote to lock/open the trunks and doors have worn out and it doesn't even work anymore.  My friend had even the same problem, from comparing our notes.

Now I am tempted to look and perhaps trading my car for the 2000 Pontiac Bonneville.  I haven't even test driven it yet, but from the look of it and reading the reviews - I think I won't be disappointed.  I would rather the 2000 Bonneville over the 2000 Impala since the Bonneville looks sexier, meanier and better looking! <br><br>
