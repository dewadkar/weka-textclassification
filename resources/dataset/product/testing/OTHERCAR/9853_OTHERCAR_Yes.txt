                 <b>T</b>he legendary Z28 moniker has stuck with the Chevrolet Camaro into its fourth generation and until its unfortunate demise in 2002. Since that magic three figure code "Z-2-8" first appeared in 1967, it has always meant the same thing to buyers; excellent performance at an excellent price.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

          <b>Once</b> you've settled yourself into the relatively plush interior of the Z28, you realize that you're in a car with a strong <b>performance</b> bias. Start the car up and the V8 engine signals its aggressive intentions through its burrbly exhaust note. The deep-chested 305 cubic inch engine hauls you rapidly towards your destination with little fuss, if any. Its <b>suspension</b> is tight around turns, thanks to improvements over the base Camaro model. With the 1Le package handling is upgraded even further.

       The Camaro's simple <b>suspension</b> consists of Macpherson struts at the front, and a simple but well located coil sprung live axle in the rear. Unlike its faster Chevrolet stable mate (the Corvette), the Camaro uses a unibody construction.

            As one would expect, the V8 engine fitted to this Camaro is the legendary small-block that can be traced back to 1955. It's a simple 305 CI OHV engine, that produces 235 hp and 300lb ft of torque. The fuel injection system (TPI) tuned port injection, helps reduce emissions while making the engine produce more power. The LT1 engine was supposed to be used in the 1992 Z28, but Chevrolet waited another year as I suggest you do too, meaning I feel you would be much more happy with a '93 or newer model.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>
 
     The <b>interior</b> in the Camaro is well thought out in terms of ergonomics, but the dash is very dated. Red was one of three interior colors that came with the heritage edition featured on the inset. The Camaro's bucket seats are very supportive and comfortable, not as supportive as the Mustang's, but more supportive than, say, a Dodge Daytona. The hatchback is huge, the luggage area of the Camaro is easily accessed through the lift up hatch, more luggage space is available when the rear seat is folded forward. My only major gripe about the 92 Z28's interior is rear passenger room. Chevrolet could have easily made this car much more comfortable for rear passengers without having to sacrifice the sporty looks.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>  
    

 The <b>exterior</b> is relatively dated, I have never been a big fan of the 3rd generation Camaro's design. I personally think it's an aggressive style, but it's not going to win any beauty contests. To celebrate the Camaro's 25th birthday in 1992 all models were finished with the heritage appearance package in red , white, or black. To keep the body looking as fresh as possible, Chevrolet designers used a bolt-on body kit of extra spoilers and side skirts.

<i>Pricing:</i>
         
The <b>Price</b> for these cars are 'right on', going for around $5,000 for a 1992 Z28 TPI. I've never owned this car so I can not comment of how reliable it is, but judging on how many I still see on the road, I would have to say this car is up there with the best of them.
