            ...at least I'm looking good and having fun getting there, right?  Some days driving the Capri is the highlight of my day!  Traffic seems less annoying and I'm generally more relaxed by the time I get home.

I have to admit though this really isn't my car.  My husband bought it the year before he met me.  Actually, the car is the reason he met me.  When my mom saw him get into this hot little car, she told me I could date an older guy as long as it was him.  I took her advice.:-)  Now my husband telecommutes, so I have my choice of cars.  Nine days out of ten, I choose the Capri.  Part of this is probably because I've just learned how to drive a manual transmission and I'm loving every minute.  The Capri was a great car to practice on!

I have many reasons for preferring the Capri.  A main one is the fact that I live in Wisconsin, a state with possibly the highest gas tax in the entire country.  I only need to fill the Capri up every seven or eight days and I'm driving it almost every day and it has a small tank - about 9 gallons.  When I drive our Jeep I go through a tank of gas in four or five days - it has a 19 gallon tank.  The Capri is also a very small car, so parallel parking and squeezing into tight spots is much easier.  And I really can't discount the fact that this is a good-looking car.  When I can put the top down it's a car that I'm proud to have people see me walk up to.  Granted, it's not a Jaguar or BMW, but I'm a teacher so my co-workers and students are suitably impressed.:)

Of course, I can't forget to mention the convertible top (which I did, so I'll fix now) which makes the car so fun.  It's pretty basic.  There is nothing automatic about the top.  The storage compartment opens with the trunk key and the top is fastened to the car with a latching device on the windows of both the driver's and passenger's side.  Putting it down is much easier than getting it up again.  The base of the bonnet needs to be fit very snuggly into the grooves above the trunk.  If it isn't secure enough, you won't get the latches re-fastened.  I had a bit of trouble with this at the beginning of spring, but I've gotten the hang of it again.  When the top is up it can get a little noisy with all of the overlap bits flapping, and the bonnet is starting to get a little ratty.  Some of the wear is just part of time, but we lived in a house without a garage for 2 years and that really sped up the aging process.  Overall, I usually hope for a slew of nice days so I don't have to worry about fussing with the top.  Fortunately the top is fairly waterproof in the average rain storm.  Even when there is a leak, usually from the car wash or a heavy down pour, the seats dry out very quickly.

This car does have a back seat, although most people have to sit sideways to fit on it.  There is no rear leg room.  Don't think that because people don't fit in the backseat that it's useless.  We did our weekly grocery shopping in the Capri for several years and never had an issue with getting all of our bulk groceries and paper products into the car.  In nice weather we've even been able to bring home pre-fab bookcases, tables, and even a lawn mower.  We just put the top down, wedged the box into the back and away we went.  Now that we have the Jeep things are a little less creative, but on occasion I have had to put our 70 lb. Labrador in the backseat for hour long round trips.  Needless to say, he prefers the top down.

A saving grace with the Capri is that the backseat folds down, so longer items can poke through the trunk.  We got my 160 cm skis into the car for a 4 1/2 hour car ride, plus all of our winter gear.  It wasn't terribly uncomfortable, either.

We have made several 4+ hour car rides in the Capri.  It certainly isn't a luxury vehicle, but it got us to where we needed to go.  The seats do get pretty uncomfortable 2 to 3 hours into the trip and one winter we had a problem with the heat not wanting come on while we were stuck in a Chicago traffic jam.  Otherwise we've had no problems with distance traveling.  Hopefully I'm not jinxing things by saying the Capri has been incredibly reliable.  We've never had a problem with it starting when it needs to or randomly dying.  The breaks squeal a bit and sometimes it won't go from neutral to reverse easily, but I think these things could be easily repaired if the mechanics at the dealership didn't keep reinforcing my opinion of their incompetence.  We have had no engine problems on the Capri and the only time it's in the garage is for the 3,000 mile oil change/check ups.

One thing we have had a problem with is the tires. The Capri is fit for high performance tires, which are more expensive.  I don't know if this is our bad luck or a flaw in the car, but we've had no less than 5 flat tires in 8 years.  One was obviously a problem with road debris and the other was due to incompetent dealership mechanics, but we've given a lot of our money to Pirelli Tires over the past few years.

On a side note about tires: snow tires on the Capri make it a very good all season car.  When the Capri was our sole car we had to drive in several Wisconsin snowstorms.  I feel safer in the 4 wheel drive Jeep, but we have had no problems in the Capri and the snow.

One last little gripe about the Capri is the trunk set-up.  The Honda Accord I used to drive has spoiled me.  There was a nice little trunk release right next to the driver's seat.  It was possible to lock the trunk with the main key (as opposed to the valet key) for added security, but it was still very convenient to get things out of the trunk during quick stops with the engine running. The Capri does not have this feature.  The trunk key is separate from the main key, but if you want to keep them on the same ring, you have to stop the car, take the keys out of the ignition, open the trunk and get back in.  I made no friends on my college campus when we had to do this little trick in the middle of traffic in front of my class.  I understand why the Capri is designed like this, but there's got to be a better way.

I highly recommend this little car.  The only other sports car/convertible that I've driven was a 1980something Ford Mustang.  It was ok, but really just a car, nothing I got too excited about (yes, I realize that there are hearts stopping all over America at this comment).  The ride was nice but there wasn't anything sporty about it.  My husband had his heart set on the Mazda Miata until he found out about the Capri.  If I understand correctly, at the time, these cars had an almost identical drive train and engine, but the Capri was $10,000 less new.  Plus, the Miata doesn't have a backseat and as I think I illustrated that even a small backseat does have a purpose.
