            Well, I have been putting off a review of this truck, because I wanted to put at least 50K on it and see if any problems arose during the trip. Well, a couple of weeks ago I passed 50,000 miles.

This is my view on this fine vehicle. The only real point that I would like to make is:

Find a dealer that you can trust. Ask around, and listen to what others have to say about the local service department.

With that said ... On with the review.

Looks:

The S-10 even in stock trim looks very appealing. The LS, and its body coloring is even better to look at. But, if you want the muscular look ... go Xtreme! This is the hottest looking truch I have ever seen. And I have been told this by many people.

Handling:

The Xtreme sits lower, and has a different suspension than that of the standard S-10, so I can not review the handling of any other truck other than the Xtreme... It stick to the road! Handling is a little rough on choppy uneven pavement ... but, the suspension quickly recovers, keeping you safe, even when pushing the truck hard.

Power: 

I drove a 2.2L S-10 ... buyer beware! they are dogs! Spend a little more (gas mileage difference between the two engines is minor) and get the extra power that the 4.3L V6 can offer.

Options:

I was amazed at the different ways that a S-10 pick up could be configured. Now you can even get a 4 door crew cab. Want 4 wheel drive ... not a problem. Just check off options as needed.

Interior:

In a word Spacious! The interior is very well marked out, leaving no piece of space unused. Plenty of leg room, I am 6'3" and leg room is important. Shoulder room, and head room for days. The only quirk, was an irritating little squeak coming from the dash, which was repaired free of charge at the service center.

Price:

I only paid 17,692, including destination charge. I would call this a great deal on a fine truck.

Warranty:

During the first 36,000 miles my truck was cared for under one of the best warranties I have ever used. My wifes car came with a 100,000 mile warranty ... but getting there service center to do anything is like pulling teeth. Any time I had a problem ... no matter how minor, no questions were asked. They just handed me the keys to a rental, and sent me on my way. Later a call would let me know that the work that I had requested was complete. You just have got to love that.

I bought the extended warranty just to make sure that I could enjoy this kind of service during the time that I keep my truck.

That was the good.
Now for the not so good.

Gas mileage:

May here have already stated that gas mileage was sub par. I am in agreement, but I have found a simple solution. A K&N filtercharger, and a jet performance chip. Those two working together picked me up another 5 miles per gallon. Enough to make the gas mileage livable. And the extra horse power generated doesn't hurt.

Paint:

After 35,000 miles, I noticed small paint chips in the hood. Once again this was repaired by the service center. The service center repainted the hood, but guess what. They are starting to show up again.
