                If you are considering acquisition of a new car, the Pontiac Bonneville is the car you want!  After recently being rear ended by another motorist, I was in the market for a new car.  After browsing numerous dealerships, I soon found my Bonneville.  
     After a brief test drive, I was hooked.  The suspension on this car is absolutely breathtaking.  Combined with the anti-lock breaking system, the wide wheel base provides maximum command of the road.  Also, the 6 cyl engine provides ample power to get you where you want to go.  The sun roof is a nice feature if you go for that sort of thing (I highly recommend it if availability and finances allow).  I have had my car for 7 years now, and the only work I have had to have done is basic maintenance.  With proper oil change, and basic tuneups, this car will last a considerably long time.  
  Negatives on this car are few, but some do exist.  Gas mileage (for the tightfisted people like me) is not as desirable as one might hope, especially as summertime gas prices skyrocket.  However, at app. 20-25 miles to the gallon, this car offers an expected amount of fuel consumption.  I am still waiting for a nice fuel efficient luxury car.  Leather seats are a bonus in most instances, however if your car is dark colored (mine is black), these seats can cause an excessive amount of heat on the posterior sections of the body in summer.  :-)   Yet, comfort-wise, these seats are heaven.  However ,the heat factor can quickly changed the heavenly atmosphere into a padded version of hell.  Get tinted windows or a windshield reflector screen if available!  
     Suspension on this car is great as I have already mentioned, and the calibrated coasting system offers a smooth and comfortable ride.  Little highway noise is heard when barreling down the roadway.  
    For the asking price, I think this car is fair.  Again, I am tightfisted, so anything in excess of $20,000 is going to be fair.  Ideal would fall more into the range of $10-15 grand.  But, overall the car is worth the asking price.  Recommended for those who like luxury with style, the Bonneville is the best I've seen in ages.  Great for the family minded, with spacious interior, or perfect for the retiree who is looking to blow some hard earned retirement money.  I give this car two thumbs (and a big toe)up.
