              The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-S70 is another neat and great camera that gives a quality resolution. The higher the pixel rate the better quality of pictures you get. The only drawback is , the higher the price of this camera and even other models.  It's an easy step by step setup to operate this camera and self explanitory menu to help you understand your machine. If your curious some features to control are image size/zoom/timer and others that you can see for yourself. In addition, you can fix up the pictures you have taken by adjusting some features(color, brightness, etc.) and search for pictures you want to delete and keep the best ones.
  I played around with this camera when I borrowed it from a friend and was a good quality digital camera. Fooling around with my pictures was neat. I had to give it back because she needed it fr class. It won't take all day to understand and use this camera maybe 20 minutes and a few glances to the users manual for those fine tunning features.
For the gadget people out there it uses a lithium battery(of course rechargable), up to three hours of use depending on the Lcd screen usage, 8 megs of memory(the memory stick) the more megs the more pictures. Usage of your computer to download your images and save them on your computer.
