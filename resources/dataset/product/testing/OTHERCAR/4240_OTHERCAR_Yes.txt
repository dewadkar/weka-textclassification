            When my wife and I first saw this car on a lot a couple years ago, we only went back at night to look at it so that nobody else would see us. We swore for the last 2 years we would not even be seen near one and that owners of the Azteks were complete fools.

But this year, as we are expecting a baby and are going through changes in life, we were in the market for a new vehicle with 4 doors.  Test drove a lot of different makes, models, prices, etc.  Nothing really grabbed us.  Options on most SUV's will cost an extra body part.  Then, curiosity led us to the Aztek.  They obviously look better now with painted plastic body molding and the 17" wheels.  (note:  we have the 16" wheels on ours)  For my wife, she had a hard time looking at it.  For me, it was love.  After the test drive, I couldn't stop thinking about it and my wife finally admitted it was the best thing we found for the price and options (so many options for so little extra...and it felt great on the road.

Yesterday, not only did we buy one,....we bought 2.  Since we'd be fighting over who got to drive it every day, we decided to have a "his and hers" set up.  We traded in an Explorer Sport and an F150 4X4 Off Road - both were less than 3 years old and had mechanical issues...it was worth every penny...and whatya know, we got $2000 rebate on each.  She got the Gold one and I got the Burgandy.  We live our lives to deviate from the norm.   Did I mention that the Pontiac Dealer we went to was the friendliest group of people I've ever met?  (of course,...just bought 2 cars from them at the end of the month).

We've never been this excited about vehicle ownership and look for reasons to go out for a drive.  Once you drive this lovely creature, you will be hooked!  The turning radius is tighter than most compact cars I've driven, the peppy accelleration is most impressive, and what can I say...that dashboard is the coolest!  I did notice that the negative reviews on certain sites came from non-owners...imagine that?  

UPDATE:  This week, in one trip I hauled 20 8' 2x4s, 3 sheets pressed wood, 4 commercial florescent light fixtures and 20 sheets of pegboard in one trip without rearend sag or burden to the engine.  Also, got around 25 mpg on a recent 600 mile road trip.

UPDATE #2:  After one month of driving our Azteks, there are no reported squeaks, flaws, etc.  Gas mileage is currently 22 City, 25 Highway.  We've long got over that blind spot in the rear where the spoiler comes across.  We still look for reasons to go for a drive!!!
