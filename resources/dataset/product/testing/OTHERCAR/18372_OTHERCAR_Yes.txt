            A year ago I bought a 1998 Hyundai Tiburon.  When I first saw the vehicle advertised in the newspaper I didn't care for it's appearance, but after seeing it on a dealer's lot I fell in love with it.  

One of the biggest factors in me deciding to buy the car was it's appearance.  It's sporty and reflects my personality, plus it's not very common to see a Tiburon where I live, which I love.  I'm not one to be on a bandwagon so the fact that Tiburons are rare where I live is a huge plus.  It makes me stand out.  The attention I get directed towards the car is amazing.  

There are many things that I love about my car.  One of the best things about it is the extended 100,000 mile ten year warranty.  What else could a student that does a lot of running back and forth between college and home ask for?  In the year that I've owned my car I've put 25000 miles on it and haven't had any real trouble with it.  The car is amazingly fun to drive and handles very well, even in bad weather (about as good as can be expected from a sports car that is).  

The only thing that I really don't like about my car is the fact that it is small.  I love small cars and I love my car, but at times, especially when travelling with friends, I wish the car were a little roomier, especially the back seat.  The trunk is amazing for the size car the Tiburon is.  The size factor is not significant enough to hinder me from buying another Tiburon in a few years because most of the time I am alone, very rarely do I wish it were roomier, but there are times that I do.  If you do not travel alone, this car is not for you.  If you are young and like to have fun and often travel alone, this car is ideal for you.<br><br>
