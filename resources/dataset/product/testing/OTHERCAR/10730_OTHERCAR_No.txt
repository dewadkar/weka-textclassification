            I bought a 1993 Buick Regal couple from a neighbor in 1995.  The car was 2 years old and was in excellant shape.  For the 9 years I've owned the car I have mixed feelings.
The car has run well and I've had no major problems with the engine.  The problems I've had are with the brakes which need to be replaced every two years (which includes replacing the calipers and rotors) which costs $500-$600 each time.  I've had them replaced 3 times already and I expect to replace them again soon since I have hearing that familar vibration which indicates the problem is happening again.   Obviously, (and I have been told) that there was a design flaw which causes the brakes to deteriorate (from rust).  There was a class action law suite which was settled.  I submitted my proof of repair (at that time my brakes were replaced twice) and the $1200 which I spent on the brakes.   I got a check for $23.50 back as my settlement.  Whoopee!  

In addition to the brakes, I had to replace the turn signal which started smoking from some wires, I replaced the driver's side door handle twice, the hood release and the parking brakes which locked up on me while I was taking my wife out to dinner on her birthday.   Also, the air-conditioning sucks.    Out of these problems, the brakes  irritate me the most since I have better things to do with my money than spend $600 every two years.
I not too into cars.  To me, cars are transportation and I will maintain and keep them for as long as its economically feasible (I would rather have the money in the bank).
My Regal's engine has been reliable and I've had no major work on it.

To summarize my review, I would be much more happy if I did not have to replace the brakes every 2 years.  The car has been reliable except for the brakes.
