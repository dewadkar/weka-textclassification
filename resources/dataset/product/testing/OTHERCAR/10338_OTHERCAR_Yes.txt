            I had plenty of options to choose from when purchasing my first car, but I when it finally came down to it I found that the 2001 Toyota Corolla LE is the most stylish, luxurious, and roomy car with great fuel economy for the money I had with which I could purchase my first car.

Let me begin with the exterior of the car.  When I first came in, the big difference I noticed between the 2000 compared to the 2001 was the new sleek lines and the stylish circle pattern in the headlights and rear lights.  Furthermore, I would have normally purchased aluminum alloy wheels because I usually hate the look of hub-caps, but not in the case of the 2001 Toyota Corolla LE.  They had a very sporty look to them which came to my liking.

I have friend who work on cars day-in and day-out as mechanics for Chevy.  When I let my friend look under the hood of my car the first word out of his mouth was, "sophisticated," which describes the mechanics of the Corolla exactly.  The 2001 Toyota Corolla LE comes equipped with a VVT-i 4 cylinder 125 horsepower engine with an automatic transmission.  VVT-i stands for Variable Valve Timing Intervals, which basically means that the car gets a lot of power out of a fuel efficient vehicle.  By the way, the statistics concerning fuel economy are 30 on city and 39 on the highway.  From my experience over the last two months of having my car, I've been averaging 32 on the city and 42 on the highway.  With high gas prices this is a real relief to my pockets.

Now, the interior is the whole reason why I bought the car in the first place.  I got an option package 2, which gave me power windows, door locks and mirrors, and air conditioning.  I also was given a Lo-Jack Remoteless Key Entry Security System, with the optional tracking chip.  If you're interested in sound systems, this one is ok.  It only comes with 4 speakers, but the sound is real clear.  I have a single disk in-dash CD, AM/FM radio, and a cassette player.  I had the option to upgrade to a 6-disk in-dash CD player and a sunroof, but I figured, I can only listen to one CD at a time so why have more disks.  An especially unique feature that also sold me on the Corolla was a separate 12V jack installed near the parking break (only available in cars with automatic transmission).  When I say separate, I mean that I also have a lighter near the ashtray, so technically I have to jacks.

Seats are very comfortable, and the back seat can fit 3 adults semi-comfortably.  I would have liked to have the option of front power adjustable seats, but it was never mentioned by the sales rep.  A couple of cool features concerning the back seats are that they fold down separately which gives even more room the already huge trunk in the Corolla.  In fact the truck has 12.1 cubic feet of luggage space...found on the Toyota Website. Another cool feature is a handle on the interior of the trunk, so if one of your kids ever locks themselves in the trunk they can get out, just like it was a regular door.  (Hell you could stick two adults in there if you wanted to illegally carry 7 people...hahaha...just kidding!).

So even though the new car smell of my first car is fading I still believe it is one of the wisests purchases I have ever made in my life.
