            I bought my 1998 Neon from a dealer in 2000. It was a rental return and had about 32,000 miles on it. I bought it for $8000. The first few months were problem free. But then...

1. When it is cold the car does not want to start. When it does finally start it lets out a loud screeching noise.

2. It leaks oil constantly. Keep in mind at this time it only has 36,000 miles. 

3. Some kind of gasket in the air conditioner melted, leaving me in the middle of an intersection with a car that was billowing smoke.

4. Everytime it is windy or a big truck drives past I have to fight to keep the car on the road.

5. The windows leak. When I go through the car wash I have to wear rain gear. 

6. It sucks trying to speed up enough to get on the freeway. Many people have given me the finger because of this. 

7. My horn doesn't work. Therefore I can't honk at the people giving me the finger. 

8. I am 6' tall and my knees are pressed up against the dashboard even with the seat all the way back. 

9. Majorly squeaky brakes. So squeaky that people squirt oil at me as I drive past. 

10. The car shakes and makes rumbling noises every chance it gets. A couple times I thought a huge truck was behind me making the terrible rumbling noises, but no, it was my lovely Neon.

At first I thought that I had so many problems because it was a rental return. But now that I have read the opinions on this GREAT site, I know that it is actually because I unknowingly bought a piece o' crap car.
