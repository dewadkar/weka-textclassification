            I received this camera for Christmas 2001.  I am an avid picture taker and was expecting my first child.  I own a SLR, 2 high quality point-and-shoot cameras, and this digital camera.  Since I purchased this digital camera, I haven't developed one roll of film!

I love this camera.  I would suggest sitting down with the camera for an hour to learn about all the features.  Then, it is really easy to use!  I love the LCD screen.  I can play back a picture I just took and if it's a little blurry or someone's eyes are closed, I can delete it and try again.

One thing that is tricky about this camera is that there is a time delay when you push the button (while the camera is focusing).  Before I learned the way around this, I missed several of my son's first smiles.  What you can do, is hold the button down half way, let it focus, then encourage that smile.  Then, click at just the right moment.  I do warn you though, this trick will eat up batteries even faster.  I purchased a couple sets of rechargeable batteries and a charger.  That way, I could just switch the batteries back and forth.  This has worked well.

I also have a nice Cannon printer that I have been using to print off the digital pictures I take.  It is just as cheap as getting film developed and you can crop or darken/lighten, etc. the pictures just the way you want to.
The quality of these prints is pretty good too...not photograph quality, but close.
