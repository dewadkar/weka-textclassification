            I was looking for a fuel efficient auto that was comfortable enough for long distances and all day driving. I found the Mazda Protege to be that car. I picked the five-speed standard transmission which is fun to drive. The CD player insures the time spent behind the wheel is surrounded with quality sounds. The car handles great, runs smooth and quiet. I love the way it reacts to me. Don't let the 4 cylinder fool you, this baby can move. The air conditioner is a blessing in the Texas heat. I'm not sure why but the drivers window is not tinted, but the rest of them are. The only thing I have a problem with, is my husband won't ride with me because it is too small. I would recommend a Mazda to anyone who likes to drive in comfort and is under 6 feet tall. The bucket seats recline fully to allow the passenger to snooze during a trip. While the back of the rear seats fold down to allow more trunk space.<br><br>
