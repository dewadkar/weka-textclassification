            That is what our then 10 month old called the car when we first looked at it (her Laa Laa).  Can you guess the color????  For the 20 months that we have had the car, we have only had one problem with it.  The problem is pretty much that the radio decided to eat the tape.....must not have enjoyed the music. VW did replace the radio free of charge.    We both fell in love with the car.....everything about it.   I have to say that the &quot;bug&quot; is a very fun car to drive, unlike any car I have ever driven.  I was amazed at the room that is in this car.  Lots of head room.  The trunk is VERY small...the only draw back to this car.   The gas mileage is about average (compared to my Accord).  Today is a sad day in our household, for we had to trade in the &quot;bug&quot;.  With 3 kids, we just could not &quot;reason&quot; the car anymore. The car will be greatly missed.  We plan on being a 'bug&quot; owner again in about 12 more years. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a fun driving and reliable car.  The cars DO hold their value, for we sold the car $600 more than what we paid for it.   So long Laa Laa......<br>
