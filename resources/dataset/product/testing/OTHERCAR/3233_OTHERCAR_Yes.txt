            I actually bought this particular camera because it was on sale (marked down from $99 to $59)
It has lots of great features, flash, LCD display, 640x480 and 320x240 resolution, great software that's easy to use, self-timer w/ blinking notification, automatic flash, & auto-light adjustments.
When I first used it I did not have to use batteries because of the a/c adapter that you can just plug in the wall and shoot away. This worked great for my first few pictures I experimented with. When it came time that I would use it away from an electrical outlet I added the 4 AA batteries (not included) and took as many pictures as I could. Most of these pictures came out great and others were pretty fuzzy and hard to make out. Well the 4 AA batteries only lasted in this camera for about a week. I had not planned on buying batteries weekly to use this camera. Well it turned out the $40 that was discounted from the camera when I purchase it were made up for when I had to keeping buying batteries. This camera completely drains the batteries out! That's also a great feature this camera has, the blinking light that comes on next to the on/off switch when the batteries get low! Bad thing is I saw this light blinking often.  
Thank goodness the pros out weigh the cons on this camera. There is also a wonderful picture erase feature that allows you take out the last picture one at a time after you realize you just had your finger in the middle of it or it came out a little fuzzy.  The pictures are recorded to the 4MB flash ROM of the camera. Unfortunately you are limited to about 27 pictures because of the resolution. The camera and software allows you to hook this camera up with a USB port on your PC to edit, publish and print your photos. The software has many album saving features and lots of editing capabilities that allow you to also use a fantasy photo form that you can turn that cute picture of the baby into a WANTED picture! Don't worry most of those pictures that seem bad on the LCD screen usually turn out pretty good when uploaded to the Polaroid Photo MAX software on your PC!  
I was impressed with the camera when it came to the software and editing. But when it comes to the battery life and resolution there are definitely a few cons! I would still recommend this camera if you could find it on sale somewhere. Mainly because there are features that come on this camera that some higher priced cameras probably dont have. Just be sure to do some comparison with the software that comes with your new digital camera. I have yet to see any camera that has better software that's easy to use, than this one.
