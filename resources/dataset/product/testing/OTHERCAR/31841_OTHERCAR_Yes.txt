            VW is making some great looking cars.  It started with the New Beetle and moved on throughout the entire Volkwagen line.   The Passat  is by far the biggest, baddest, best looking  VW you'd ever want to know,  add the all-wheel drive (4-motion in VW language) and you have a serious Autobahn stormer.

On the road the Passat feels very powerful.  The Passat's V-6 makes a mockery out of any turbo-charged 4 cylinder.  The V-6 puts out 190 hp, that is less than both Camry and Accord, but there is something about the Passat that makes it feel much more powerful than it is.  The five speed automatic certainly has something to do with the perceived power of this car.  While most cars in the Passat's class have a 4 speed automatic, the Passat's five speed gives you that extra bit of torque in each gear.  With the available Tiptronic transmission, you can maximize your fun.  While the Tiptronic is fun in that it lets you choose your own shift points (no manual trans. is available with the 4-motion feature), it is simply a luxury.  The Passat would be just as much fun without Tiptronic, and you can save $1,100 .

Speaking of options, the 4-motion is worth the extra $1,670.  In almost every road condition ( I did not drive in the snow), the car simply sticks like glue.  It won't spin out.  It won't understeer and it won't oversteer (believe me I tried).  Even gravel or wet roads can' t make the Passat 4-motion feel unstable, and on dry pavement, this Passat feels like a slot car.  It simply inspires confidence other cars cannot match.  It would virtually take gross negligence to get the Passat 4-motion to come un-stuck from the road.   All this performance and a nice quiet ride with the perfect balance of  comfort and sportiness. As if all this were not enough, shift the car into reverse and the right side mirror automatically tilts in, and down to show you what misplaced toy you are about to run over.  It's a very cool feature.

Inside, the Passat in GLX trim is very luxurious.  Seats are firm, supportive, and adjust to any position.  Three separate memory functions for the driver's seat make sharing the car a breeze.  Heated front seats are a nice bonus.  Interior is very spacious, headroom is muï¿½h more than adequate.  

The only advantage some of the Japanese cars may have over the Passat, is  rear seat room.  The Camry and Maxima seem to have a lot more room for the rear passengers. Also, the rear seats do not fold down, but instead have a pass-through opening.  Split folding seats are better, but it's a minor sacrifice.  Gauges are big and easy to read, at night they glow in blue neon, much like the Beetle.  Wood trim is limited and adds a touch of class to an already great car.  The Monsoon stereo is among the best stock stereo in any car, at any price.  The trunk is very spacious, and comes with very sturdy, fold away tie-downs.  As with almost all German cars the A/C and dash mounted controls are too close together and look too similar to each other.  Often, changing the A/C setting requires a look away from the road.  On the other hand, the dial type control for the sunroof works well and is especially easy to use without looking away from the road.

A fully loaded Passat with 4-motion can easily hit $30,000.  The good news is, knock off a few of the non-essentials and the price will be well into the $20's.  Let's face it, the Passat 4-motion is a thinly disguised Audi.  Like most Audi cars, the Passat is fast, smooth, nimble, solid and very fun to drive.  It's almost the perfect performance sedan.
