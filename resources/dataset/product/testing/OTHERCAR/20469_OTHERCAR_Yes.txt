            I own a 1996 Lumina.  Back in 1996, I was deciding between a Taurus and a Lumina for my next car for my family.  I decided to buy the Lumina because it was cheaper, more comfortable, and had better visibility.  I have not regretted the decision.  It is a quiet car, and is overall easy to drive. Knock wood, there have been no repairs needed so far.  The ride is smooth and everyone in my family loves it!  The only drawbacks are that it is not flashy at all, and that there is not an excellent color selection.  The color I chose, &quot;forest green,&quot; looks to be almost black.  It, however, does its job and is a good value! <br><br>
