            This car has been a tank!  It will go through anything and keep on running.  We recently had over a foot of snow, and my car had absolutely no problems plowing through where snow plows hadn't had a chance to get to yet.  The only problem I've really had with the car has been the number of times I've had to replace the brakes.  But it seems that GM is known for their brake problems, so it's not necessarily out of the ordinary.  After all, I replaced the brakes four times on an eleven year old car with 165,000 miles on it.  Considering that was the only major repair the car needed other than the routine maintenance, I would definitely say it's been a good car.  It rides nice and gets decent gas mileage for its size and age (especially on the highway - I get 28-30 mpg; city isn't so good 18-21 mpg).  Paint and body have held up well, too, but I did always sand down chips, prime them, and use touch up as they occurred.  Seats are a little on the large size, so they are not as comfortable for long road trips due to the lack of support.  But the roominess of the interior is a major plus.
