            When the time came for my husband to look for a new car, I came along with him as I wanted to make sure he would get a good and safe car.

We looked in several places and I was not satisfied with the safety of the car and nagged my husband about it.  Finally we ended up looking at the Saturn.

The salesperson was a very friendly guy who let us hit the doors with a hammer and then continued giving us information about the car.  I was impressed with the safety of the car and the interior.  The driver's seat and the passenger seat are very comfortable and with enough space for movement.  However, the back seats have less space and are a little more cramped.

My husband surprised me when he came home in the Saturn and I got in.  It has a great sunroof and is economical.  I decided this was a the car I was looking for.<br><br>
