            My previous digital camera was a refurbished Sony DSC-F1, which has served me very well for more than two years. I loved it for its small size and ease of use. However, its maximum resolution is 640x480...inadequate compared to today's standard. I needed a digital camera that can take megapixel photos and has tons of options. Choosing the Coolpix 990 wasn't a really hard decision.
I bought mine from Egghead.com for $831.00. It was backordered for more than a month, since this item is in very low supply. When I opened the box, I found the camera, instruction manuals, CD-ROMs, a CompactFlash memory card, USB cable, Video cable, 4 AA Alkaline batteries and a camera strap. I am disappointed that Nikon decided not to include the camera's carrying case, which only costs a mere $10...a tiny amount compared to the $999 MSRP price tag that comes with this unit.
The CompactFlash card is a Lexar 8x 16MB model. It is sufficient as long as you don't take pictures in maximum quality and resolution. I usually set mine for 1024x748 (XGA) resolution and FINE quality. Using this setting, I can take 40 pictures.
The user interface is very intuitive. You navigate through the options using the menu screen on the built-in LCD monitor, which you control by using the D-pad located to the right of the monitor. The vast array of options can be very confusing to the average user, but I like my camera to have too much options rather than too few. Most of the features that you can find in a Nikon SLR camera is included: Aperture size, Shutter speed, Film sensitivity (ISO), Exposure adjustment, just to name a few.
One thing that really satisfies me is the USB interface that this camera offers. I can download pictures from the camera at a rate of approximately 1MB per second...and that is really fast! That means you can download data from a full 64 MB card in just over a minute.
