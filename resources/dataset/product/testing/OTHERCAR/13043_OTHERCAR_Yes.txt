            When Pontiac says that you can drive the excitement, they aren't stepping around the truth.  I own a 1992 Pontiac Grand Prix SE GTP and owned a 1989 Pontiac Grand Prix SE before I bought my '92.  

I used to work in my dad's auto shop and he always checks out every car that I buy.  He liked the condition that both of the Grand Prixs were in so I bought them.  

I enjoy driving them.  The 1992 has great acceleration and handling.  It is fun to take the backroads on vacations because I get to ride the turns and carve the curves due to the car's exceptional handling. 

The cars have very few mechanical problems and are very reliable.  I always change the oil every 3,000 miles and tend to get at least 180,000 out of every car that I own.  

The interior is sufficient.  I wish that it was just a little more roomy, but nonetheless, it is still very comfortable. 

I think that I like the looks of the exterior the best.  I would recommend buying the GTP package. It really enhances the appearance of the car.  The ground effects transform an ordinary car into a sporty model.  It will also make your car a lot easier to sell.  

The car gets pretty good gas mileage, unless you drive like I do.  The tires are pretty expensive because they're wider and made for a sports car.  They make the car look nicer and handle better, but are a little more than twice as much as normal tires. 

One more thing, I strongly recommend that you change the oil every 3,000 to 4,000 miles.  My dad owns his own mechanic shop and I have seen vehicles in the shop with over 600,000 miles.  The one thing they had in common, regular oil changes.  My car has around 90,000 miles on it and is running excellent.  If you care about your car, go change your oil.

Overall, I have had great experiences with both of the Pontiac Grand Prix's that I have owned.  I am looking forward to buying another Grand Prix in the next year.  <br><br>
