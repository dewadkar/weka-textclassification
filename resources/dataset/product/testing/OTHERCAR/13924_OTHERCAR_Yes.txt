               A few months ago I traded my older 1998 SC2 (see older opinion) for a newer model.  It is a bright yellow, 5-speed, 3-door SC2 2001 Saturn Coupe.  I found that many changes have been made to the car, style and electronics inside the car.  The new design is very sleek, including the very limited bright yellow.  The back reverse lights have been moved to the bottom, the rear spoiler was made smaller and more inconspicuous.  The 3rd door technology was also added, making access to the back seats easier.  Fogs lights are no longer an option.  The stereo (CD/AM/FM/CASS) system sounds much better and has many more options than the 1998 coupe.  Handling on the road seems to be smoother.  The inside console was added between the passenger side and the driver side seats.  

   This is one of the safest and most dependable cars on the road.  And the price is fantastic for this car.  It was priced at $18,000, but the trade in made it $10,000.  If you have been looking for a safe, dependable car, or a car for your teen siblings who are still learning to drive...  This is a car you should definitely stop by and take a look at, and possibly a test drive.<br><br>
