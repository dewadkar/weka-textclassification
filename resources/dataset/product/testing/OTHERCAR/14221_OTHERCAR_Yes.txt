            I was truly seconds away from buying the highly-recommended Kodak DC-280 when I decided to give the Casio QV-2000UX one more look. And with all the best features (2.11 megapixels, 3x optical/2x digital zoom) and some features the Kodak doesn't even offer (record movies as ready-to-use .AVIs, assemble panoramas, smaller and lighter, a sexy interface and more) -- and a lower price (about $100 cheaper) to boot -- I took a leap of faith and got the Casio.

And I don't regret it one bit.

This is my fourth digital camera, and easily my favorite so far. Casio doesn't have much of a reputation for digital cameras, I know, but the new QV-2000UX just might be the sleeper hit of the industry. It looks and feels like a 35mm automatic, but it's a champion. It has a sharp menu system for beginners with macro, night and portrait presets, extensive manual setting capabilities (aperture, shutter speed, white balance, focus) for pros, quick memory (I'd wager the Casio takes a fraction of the time the Kodak does to save a high-resolution image), sharp, rich images, a variety of resolution and image-quality options, easy USB transfer... everything you want in a megapixel digicam.

But the little goodies -- like .AVI movies, panorama stitching, quick shutter (1.5 second) and continuous recording (0.5 seconds), cute black-and-white or sepia filters -- may be what win you over. I took a short video of my daughter stretching and yawning, and a minute later, it was on its way via e-mail to her grandparents.

It's also one of the first cameras to be compatible with IBM's Microdrive, which -- if you can afford one -- means 340MB of storage.

I agree with an earlier comment that the lens cover setup is a little bizarre, but more than forgivable and managable, and pretty much the only design flaw I can think of for this marvel. The lack of an AC adapter is also unfortunate, but a common oversight in the digicam world.

(Rechargable AAs have saved me a mint over the years!)

Some might find the included PhotoLoader download-and-browse software a little clunky, but I've grown to appreciate its intuitive date/folder hierarchy, thumbnailing, and use of the standard Windows/MSIE interface, which makes it scandalously easy to save an entire day's gallery of shots, linked from thumbnails, to the web.

I read all the glowing reviews of the Kodak DC280, but went with my instinct -- &quot;don't buy a digital camera from a company that makes its money selling regular film&quot; -- and couldn't be happier.

The QV-2000UX won't make PC Magazine's favorites list, but it's tops on mine.
