            I can usually tell if a car is good or bad within about ten to fifteen minutes of driving.  Within about five minutes, I hated this car.  Now, keep in mind that this <i>was</i> a fleet car, but the other fleet cars I've driven, had over 110,000 miles, this neon had only 52,000 miles.  

I spent the first ten miles of my trip adjusting, and readjusting the seat, and could not get it right.  I looked (and felt like) I was sitting in the electric chair, which was preferable to sitting in the reclining position.  After the first 150 miles, I think my right leg went to sleep.  At first I thought it was my wallet.  I took my wallet out, but that didn't seem to work, my leg still felt numb.  When I got to Baltimore, my back hurt, and so did my legs.  The other seating issue I noticed was that the head rest was not adjustable.  

I noted that the radio knobs had fallen off, the ashtray had broken, the brakes squeeked (I complained about this, and I was told that it was a defect with the Neon itself), and it stalled a few times on start up.  I felt like I was at the end of the movie <i>Gung Ho</i>.  The rear deck/rear window also made in difficult to back up (I personally prefer a large rear window with lots of visibility). 

The car not all bad, though.  I drove 253 miles, and used 7.737 gallons of gas (about 32.7 miles per gallon).  The ride was fairly quiet, and the car handled well at 65 mph.

Over the years, I have driven about 40,000 - 50,000 miles per year in a variety of cars, including Fords (Crown Victoria, F150), Chevys (Lumina, Caprice Classic), GM cars (Saturn), and some specialized vehicles(fire engines, etc).  In comparison, I would rather have driven a 17 ton fire engine 253 miles than deal with this car.  I can't speak for the new 2000/2001 models, but if you come across a used Neon for sale, walk the other way!<br><br>
