            I have had an accord for a couple of years now and I must say that it is one of the best cars that money can buy.  I have been thoroughly satisfied by the gas milage, safety, and other features that I have encountered while driving my car.  Since I purchased it back in 1996, I have found myself buying only one tank of gas every week and a half to two weeks, averaging about 350 to 400 miles per gallon.  This is not the only reason I love my car though.  It is roomy and spacious in the front seats and the back seats and it gives a smooth ride.  I would suggest anyone to buy this car wether they be a family man or a business man seeing as how it is so economical.  I highly recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
