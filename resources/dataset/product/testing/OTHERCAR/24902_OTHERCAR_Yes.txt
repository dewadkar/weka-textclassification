            I recall the whole Yugo story, from the time of introduction to the Clinton embargo which ended Yugoslavian exports. 

The entry-level Yugo GVs and the upscale GVLs, GVXs and Cabrios are based on the proven Fiat 128 design. Heavier-than-standard sheet metal is used, the same gauge as Mercedes-Benz and Volvo. 

The cars had a terrific price advantage, about half that of the other low-priced cars. But it was seen that this factor actually caused some buyers to adopt a 'disposable-car' mentality and neglect even minimal maintenance ... including basic oil changes, and the crucial timing-belt change every 40,000-50,000 miles ...  so check the car's records (any car's, actually) to assure that the owner wasn't to blame for neglecting normal upkeep (which includes use of 89-octane-minimum fuel and 20W40 oil in the high-compression engine.)

Yugos do very well in racing, due in part to transverse rear springing which helps lots in normal use. The front compartment has plenty of room, the rear much less so. If you're a lane-changer, the fast steering and tight ride make for nimble, sporty handling. In town, you'll appreciate the ease of slipping into parking spots unavailable to larger vehicles.

This is a subcompact car (I <b>like</b> small cars), with all the advantages and disadvantages inherent within. As such, Yugo is one of the best I've seen. Parts are readily available and owner support ( http://www.groups.yahoo.com/group/YugoGV ) is strong.   As expected, most people adopt easy theories and assumptions about products that are no longer available new, including Yugo, but in reality a Yugo could be perfect for anyone looking for that neat little car they've always wanted.
 
And now that the political situation seems to be resolved overseas, I hope that Yugo will again be exported to the Americas. Here are the new models: http://www.yugo.co.yu .
