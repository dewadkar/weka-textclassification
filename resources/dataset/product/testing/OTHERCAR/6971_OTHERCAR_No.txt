            This car looks like it drives and drives like it looks, bouncy and smooth.  It's like driving a hovercraft.  Bad news: other cars will resent your size and limited maneuverability. Also, live in the city?  Try parallel parking this- ok, if you're skilled driver that's one thing, but finding a space big enough for this boat is a long shot. I'll let you in on a little secret, all the Blazer owners I know can't seem to keep their precious vehicles out of the mechanics garage. All the models for the past few years seem to have this problem, but I chose to write about the '99 because I've spent the most time driving this one- and though it only had 16,000 miles on it it rattled like tractor on the highway. But the biggest deterrent as far as  investing in a Blazer would have to be it's reliability- you never know when it'll break down.  One of my friends has a Blazer(95) and it just died on her last summer, leaving her stranded. She was advised to junk it, it only had 3,600 miles on it.
