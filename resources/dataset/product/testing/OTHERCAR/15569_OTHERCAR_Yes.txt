            I purchased this van after the family started growing.  We now have 3 children under 3, so we need the space.  We felt relatively comfortable buying this van since it has been on the market for around 15 years with very few changes.  We liked the idea of the AWD and rear AC.  We thought many of the mini-van�s were just too small.
We used to take it to the shop when we heard �noises� etc, but have learned that most of the �noises� take care of themselves, I know, strange.  This platform still suffers from the once common van stresses and produces the body screeches and moans when driving into lots, etc.  But, I can live with that.  The other noises sounded much worse, even the mechanics heard it, front end popping noises, but they have mysteriously disappeared.  My father says, �Typical Chevrolet style�(who knows).  Most of the time it runs real well, sometimes it misses (less than 5% of the time), but that too goes away.  We hear the gas pump squeal some people complain about, but only when the windows are down.  There is some exhaust noise for the back seat passenger, but we can live with that.  We have had no quality problems, and no mechanical problems.  My son did put a few pennies in the cigarette lighter and blow the fuses, burn up the power window switch and destroy the rear lift gate switch, that cost us $200.  But it wasn�t Chevrolet�s fault.  The tires have worn evenly and we are on the second set with 45,000 miles on the van.  The seats are very heavy, so we just leave them where they are.
The greatest plus is its size, but make sure it will fit in your garage.  We have to fold in one mirror every time we pull in.  My sister has a Montana and she is always borrowing our van because it is bigger and will haul more people and stuff.
So, if you have one or two kids and don�t need AWD and don�t need a lot of space and don�t often have a lot of people traveling with you, look at a minivan.  This is not a minivan, I would prefer to call it a mid-size van.
