               After looking at SUVs, I decided to go with a Bimmer and am extrememly happy with the decision.  I mean why pay 30 a thousand for a lemon Grand Cherokee when I could have a so far reliable BMW? I recently bought a brand new 2001 325 Ci.  This car is amazing.  First of all the engine has remarkable power at a 6 liter, 184 horsepower.  I thought that it might be slow and not very powerful b/c the 330 is 220 horsepower however I feel that the 184 horsepower is more than enough compared to most sports cars.  Save your money on added options, the 325 is plenty adeqate instead of the 330.  The car handles great, the dynamic stability control is outstanding and the driver side air bags are a great standard feature.  Anyways on the inside I went with the leatherete since it is easier to take car of and cheaper than leather.  Another feature unique on BMWs is the steptronic transmission.  This is where you have the option to go with the standard automatic transmission or a sports mode or the sweet clucthless manual transmission.  I personally like shifting the gears myself and really enjoy that without having to worry about my foot on the clutch. 
   Starting at under 30 grand this car has amazing value and timeless style.  When I get into my car each morning I am excited and proud to own this amazing automobile.  The options packages are pretty cool also like the navagation system and parking sensors.      <br><br>
