            An Excellent Pickup

SONOMA S-10 Extended Cab, 2003

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Sonoma S-10 is a General Motor product manufactured and sold by the Chevrolet division of GM. This pickup truck as been manufactured since the early 80&#146s and was redesigned by Chevrolet in 1995.

Buyers have a choice of 2 different engines a 4 cylinders and a more powerful V-6 engines. You can also choose between 2 transmissions, a manual 5 speeds and an automatic. The Sonoma S-10 and the GMC Blazer S-15 are two of the most popular pickups sold in America. 

THE INSIDE & OUTSIDE

The interior:

The interior looks and feels good. On the dashboard you will find a complete selection of gauges and are well displayed for easy reading. The center console offers enough storage room and is easy to access.

The seats are fairly comfortable in the front of the cabin for rear it is a bit tight. I was surprised to notice that adjustable back support on the driver side of the seat is as good as for a luxury car.

The plastic trims of the interior did look a bit shabby; also I felt that Chevrolet could have done a little better with the finishing touch inside this truck.

The exterior:

The interior looks smart but again as for the interior it seems that there could have been a better job with the finish of the exterior. An example of what I am trying to say is with the bumpers, the color on them appears to be a few shades darker than the rest of the truck.

THE ROAD TEST

The model I drove was fun to drive and the V-6 engines offered enough power that anyone would need in a small pick up truck. The transmission shifted smoothly and the engine turns at less than 2,000 RPM at 60 miles per hours.

As for road handling the tires tended to easily slide on wet pavement and it was too hard to keep the rear from swinging back and forth. To compensate this, Chevrolet offers a factory installed differential that will give the driver better control.

Breaking on dry pavement is excellent but again on wet pavement and especially when you are hauling cargo in the back there can be a problem with controlling the vehicle.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The truck I drove was as follows:

Engine: V6, 4.3L
MPG: 20 miles/gallon 
Transmission: Automatic

Brakes: Front disc, rear drum. 
Tires: P205/75R15

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

I feel that this is a good truck. It is fairly comfortable if you are sitting on the front seat but it is tight and uncomfortable in the rear.

I like the power the V6 engine gives the driving comfort and the way the gauges are displayed on the dashboard.

I disliked the lack of control on wet pavement and the fact that for both the interior and exterior of the truck it seems that a better job could have been done
