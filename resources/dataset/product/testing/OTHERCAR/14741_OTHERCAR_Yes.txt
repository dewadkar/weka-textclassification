            It was early in my high school career and I had just accumulated my first $1,700 dollars. I was excited looking for a car to buy, as upcoming was the day I would get my license. I wanted a car that was fast, economical, good gas mileage, and reasonably good looking for $1,700 bucks. To my surprise the car of my dreams was around the corner my 1986 Honda Crx Hf. This was and still is the car of my dreams. If I had more money I am sure I would have gone with another car, though for this price my little &quot; White Lightning&quot; was the smartest buy of my life. And is still running strong to this day.

I love so many things about this car its hard to consume all the emotions in just this opinion. To begin, I love the way it looks, it is so sleak and speedy looking. The convenience of having only two seats is awesome at times, where I don't have to lug around the bulk of my friends. Though they plead to be put in the backseats and on occasion. Trying to park in cramped spaces is no problem at all for this little car. It slides in so gracefully with the 95 horses purring so quietly under its small body. With such little power one asks why this car, with a light body weight those 95 horses pick up in quite an instant. I love the interior with its convenient button locations, and reasonably sized glove compartment to old all my nits and pieces. 

The car could be improved in some ways. By making the carpet a little more sturdy. My carpet is coming out and I think I will get it custom redone to make the car look nice. I also don't like how the center console does not flow to the ground and behind the drivers seat.

With only paying $1,700 dollars for a car you cannot expect that much. Though after nearly 30,000 miles the car is holding up beautifully and I can't complain. If you live in California also and experience the tremendous rise in gas prices as I have you will also reap the benefits of this extremely gas efficient car. The car is a dream and to have one is to be devine. IF you have the extra cash and our looking for a compact car to get around town or to commute, any CRX is the right way to go.<br><br>
