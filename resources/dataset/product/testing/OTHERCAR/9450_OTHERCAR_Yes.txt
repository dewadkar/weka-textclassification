            The Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab is a great buy!  The four door roominess makes it easy to load my child's car seat, but it is also versatile enough to carry adults and their work equipment.  My wife loves the truck.  It is sometimes a little difficult for her to climb in, but once inside she loves to drive it and is as comfortable as she is in our minivan.  She was a little disappointed with the &quot;one interior fits all&quot; concept, but she has grown to accept the multicolored seats, and  she loves the exterior style and color.

The 5.9 liter V-8 is makes towing a breeze.  We bought this truck with family towing in mind, and the combination of power and interior roominess makes these trips effortless.  The safety features like &quot;second generation air bags&quot; with a passenger side on/off switch are wonderful.  The Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab is quiet, roomy, comfortable, and versatile enough to do anything, a great all around buy.<br><br>
