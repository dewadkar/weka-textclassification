            When I came out of the alley at about 4pm, there she sat with her shiny new Buick. I was angry. What I had read about this car suggested it had all the technological advantages of a car built in 1982. It was not recommended by any of the car magazines I had used to research. On top of all of that, the initial impression I got of the car was that it looked like something drawn out in a few minutes, and immediately put into production. This car just isn't pretty at all. I didn't like it from the start, but I wasn't going to completely hate it until I had driven it. Two days later a few of my buddies and I were driving to Atlanta. the back seat of my car is a little cramped, so I borrowed our new Buick Century. The first thing I noticed on the inside was how uncomfortable the seats were. I said, &quot;theres still a chance it drives well, heck the supercharged Regal is a dynamo, and these are very similar cars.&quot; I pushed the throttle down. Nothing. I tried it again. Still nothing. It took me a few moments to realize that you had to push the gas down, hold it, and wait for the car to do anything. Then I proceeded at a slow pace. Rather later(about 13 seconds at my guess)when I got the car up to highway speed I noticed that the car vibrates. <br><br>
