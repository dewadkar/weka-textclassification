            Jeeps the toughest vehicles around. The can go though water, mud, snow, and what ever else the environment can dish out.  I personally own two jeeps and will always own a jeep.  I  originally bought my first jeep because I live in south Florida and there is nothing like driving with the top down in the Florida sun.  My second jeep I bought as a fixer-upper; I've rebuilt it totally from scratch.  I love jeeps so much because they are cheap and easy to work on and for their versatility.  However, with all great things their are draw-backs.  For soft-top jeeps there is NO security for valuables, so you can't go to the store and leave you phone in the car.  Other than that driving a jeep is like driving other SUV's.  The new jeeps today offer so many options that it's like driving a luxury off road vehicle, but not at the luxury price.  I would recommend a jeep for someone who is looking to have a little fun and the sun.  My personal opinion &quot;there is nothing more attractive than a man or woman driving a jeep with the top down.<br><br>
