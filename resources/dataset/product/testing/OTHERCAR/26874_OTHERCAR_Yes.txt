            My friend is in the market for a new truck, so we went for a test-ride in a new Dodge Dakota Quad-Cab.  Now, I went into this experience just expecting this ride to be like any other test-drive, but I was pleasantly surprised at everything that this truck has to offer.  It turned out that this would be one of the best-made vehicles that I have ridden in up to this point in my life.  It looked nice, it felt nice, and it even smelled nice :)

Besides seating a capacity of 6, this truck affords the needed leg-room for anyone that is in the truck.  With the extended cab, it presents itself as almost being car-like.  One of the extras you can get with it is a canopy that makes it look even more like a car.  But, once inside, you know that you aren't in a car.  The horsepower behind this thing is immense, and although we didn't get a chance to find out how much torque this thing could take, the salesman told us that it can hold its own.  

When I first heard of the "Dakota's", I was under the impression that they were only SUV's, and that they really didn't have much to offer the "average person."  But I came to realize that they do offer a lot.  Now there is a truck that isn't huge, and can still haul a family around in it.  

In the truck, the back seats fold up, and more space can be made to store stuff.  Another one of the extras that can be ordered with the truck is a tool-set that packs under the back seats.  It is a very large one too, that allows for everything from a shovel to a tire-fixing kit.  The bed of the truck is 5 feet 3 inches long, and it is as long as they produce.  One of the things my friend likes to do in his old truck is go camping and just lay down in the back, which is near impossible with the bed of this truck, but I guess some sacrifices must be made to get that extra passenger room.

Afraid that if you buy a truck it will be too loud?  Fear not with this one, because it purrs like a kitten.  You can barely even hear the engine as you are driving, which caught me off guard.  I hadn't even heard my friend turn on the engine, before we were pulling out of the parking lot.

One thing not so good about the truck though, is that it isn't too cheap.  The one my friend was looking at was selling for 26 grand.  But, it had a lot of the "fixings" on it.  (The thing he liked the best was the CD/Tape deck... go figure). My favorite part was riding shotgun in a truck that has leg room!

If you are a truck lover who is expecting or has a family, then this is a vehicle to strongly consider.  The thing that I recommend the most about this truck, is that it is made for more than just two people like most trucks, rather it is built to support a full family.  That is why I will be looking for a truck like this when I finally start to settle down with my own family.
