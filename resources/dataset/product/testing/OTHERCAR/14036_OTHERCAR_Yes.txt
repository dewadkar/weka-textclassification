            The 2-door version of the Pontiac Sunfire is definitely NOT a family vehicle!  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved my 1998 Sunfire.  However, my husband did not.

I found this vehicle fun to drive, comfortable, and sporty.  It is great for a single gal, an average-sized gal!  I am 5'4&quot; tall and this car fit me perfectly.  But, it is not comfortable for taller people.  If you are 5'9&quot; or taller, there just is not enough room in the driver seat and there are additional blind spots.

We recently added a baby to our family and had to install a car safety seat.  With the infant seat placed behind the passenger seat, there is not enough room for anyone but a child to sit up front.  It is also very difficult to put you child in a rear-facing safety seat in this 2-door model.  I actually had to get into the back seat of the car to perform this task.  Not very convenient!

All in all, I loved this car!  I never experienced any problems with it outside of a few manufacturer recalls.  The gas mileage was great, I averaged about 25 miles per gallon.  It was reliable, easy to drive, and handled well.  I was pleased with my purchase of this vehicle, but had to trade it in for a family car.  <br><br>
