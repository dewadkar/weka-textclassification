            This is so far the best Maxima that has ever been produced. If you want (or need) a 4 door family car but also want something sporty without having to rob a bank, this is the car. There is no other car under 30K that can give you as much sportiness in a 4 door sedan than a Maxima. The Toyota Camry is reliable but not sporty and under powered. Same with the Honda Accord. Even with a restyle for this year the Accord is boring, and its 240 horsepower cant be seen ( I drove a couple and was unimpressed with the lack of power for a 6 cyl.). The Maxima ways seems to have plenty of power on tap and handles as well as some sports coupes I've driven. The next model Maxima may have some improvements but the body is to much like an Altima. Given the fact that some dealers will actually deal and sell the car for a reasonable price (I got a great deal on a loaded minus leather car) Ill stick with Nissan. They are a very reliable car maker (ive owned 3 other Nissans) and the car is rock solid. By the way--My Maxima was 2500 dollars cheaper than my brother in laws 2003 Accord with ALMOST as many options as my car. One final comment is on the problem of torque steer many other people complain about. As with almost all front wheel drive cars you tend to feel the torque steer on this car. But it is not worse than any other front driver, just more noticeable on this car by many because I think they tend to hit the gas harder and when you do that it does become more noticeable because of its power. Driven normaly it is hardly noticeable.
