            Whether it's white, black, blue or green, hard top, soft top, or no top this vehicle falls into a class of its own.  It is essentially a grown up's Lego set, in that almost every part of a Jeep not only comes off, but was DESIGNED to come off.

The carpeting snaps in and out so that you can preserve it if you're lugging some heavy, dirty, greasy materials around with you.  The doors come off as does the top, in case you really want to feel the air whiping around your body.  Perhaps you want to be a little more adventurous?  Well then, there are instructions in the owner's manual for removing the rollbars and folding the windshield down.  If it rains and you accidentally left a window open over night and step into a cute little lake that formed on your floor, no worry, just unsnap the rug, pull it out and dry it off in the sun for a little while.  This vehicle was designed to take abuse.  You can leave the top off through the worst weather and not only take the carpeting out as I mentioned, but pull the plug out of the floor and watch that water drain out in a few second.

When it comes to buying a Jeep many people ask themselves and a dealer if they should choose a soft top or a hard top.  There are advantages and dsadvantages to both.  I personally own a soft top, but there are times I wish it was a hard top.

With a hard top you get some added security to your personal belonging you might leave in your car.  You can get a wiper for the rear window, during winter you'll love this feature since, on mine, I can barely see out the rear window with the amount of salt that gets caked up on it.  The top is removable even though it's not soft, it just takes more time.

With a soft top you have the option of taking the roof off at any given time you feel like it and then storing the windows in the back seat if you like.  If it were a hard top you'd have to plan ahead to remove the roof so you would have a place to store it and would probably need some help lifting it off.  Although it's easier to break into a Jeep with a soft top, it's still difficult since all the windows require a latch to be unhooked from the inside, or a door of some type to be open to allow the section to come loose.  Since most thieves don't like to leave themselves prone when they're breaking into a car few will take the time to work a zipper open or a window off.  The obvious disadvantage is that it's easy to take a knife and slice a window open :( having a lockable glove compartment and storage space between the front seats allows for safe storage of small things though.

Once you get used to the &quot;how to's&quot; of taking the top off it only takes about 5-10 minutes to take off and about 10 to put on if it's a soft top.

Even if you aren't that familliar with cars it's relatively simple, when compared to other cars, to work on a Jeep.  Whether it's an oil change, tune-up, or tires, almost everything comes off readily.  It's height allows you plenty of room to manuver underneath as well, which makes for an easy oil change :)

I'd personally recommend a manual transmission just so you can get a good feel for the car.  Chances are, if you enjoy a 4x4 and like the appeal of a Jeep you'd probably choose a manual anyway.  A six cylinder seems to be recommended, from wht I've heard, the four cylinders often have problems and parts wear out faster on them then they would a six.

Tipping isn't as much of a problem as people seem to make it either.  It's amazing how people hear that &quot;Jeeps tip easily&quot; and suddenly anyone that drives a Jeep feels it's going to tip over around the first turn they take, I had the same problem when I first started to drive mine. You have to look at the entire vehicle though, it's a higher profile vehicle than any car is and it has incredible cornering capability; the center of it's weight though is on the base, not the top and it's cornering ability is beneficial more often that it causes problems.  True, if you're doing 60mph and turn the wheel sharpley and suddenly chances are you're going to be rolling down the highway for a good mile or so.  That's under the most extreme conditions though, for every day driving, you can take a turn at about 20mph and not really feel any tipping, besides, most people wouldn't take a turn at more than 20 in a car either.  I actually feel safter in my Jeep than I do in a convertable for one reason, the roll bars.  If a convertible were to tip I'd be about 1 foot shorter when the peeled me out of the car than I would have been when I got into the car, if my Jeep were to tip I'd be banged up but ALIVE afterwards.  Basically, if you're already a safe driver, you shouldn't have much to worry about if you're driving a Jeep.

The only thing some people worry about is the gas... I can't blame them either, about 16 miles/gallon on a 4 liter, 6 cylinder manual last I checked.<br><br>
