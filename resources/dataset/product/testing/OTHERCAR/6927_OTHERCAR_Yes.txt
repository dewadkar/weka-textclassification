            Why? Becuase its one of the most gas efficient car in the world,(60-70mpg) its made my Honda, long lasting, reliable, quality made car.  It looks like a futuristic CRX, very cool! It is going at a resonable price, starting at $18,000. It has a really cool looking interior, looks like a sports car especially with the two seats.   With gas prices the way they are it seems like the only way to go, they are only going to get higher, its not as bad on pollution. Very aerodynamic.  Reasons you shouldnt get one, its a new car, it may have some problems, there are no backseats, I dont mind much, cool for speakers.  Its not powerful. But it defenetly serves its purpose. It is made out of aluminum, I am not an engineer, but a car made out of my pepsi can doesnt sound too safe.<br><br>
