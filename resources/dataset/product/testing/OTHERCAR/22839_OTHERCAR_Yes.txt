            Before I get into the reasons why I love my car, you should stop reading if you fall into any of the following and you are thinking of buying an Integra.
- You are over 6'1&quot;
- You plan on having passengers in the back seat for more than 5 minutes
- You hate reliable cars

First of all, I own a 1996 Acura Integra GS-R.  I bought it straight out of college and have never regretted it.  Why I love my car...

<b>Value</b>
I managed to lease this car for less than $300/month.  I got a special deal from Acura and bought in December of '96 but regardless, it was a great deal.  Buying it will probably run you between $400 and $450/month.  If an integra is in your price range, you should definitely consider it.  You can save yourself some money by getting the LS but I couldn't live without the VTEC.

<b>Reliability</b>
I drive my car hard in the city and fast on long road trips.  Regardless, it keeps on going without missing a step.  Be smart and change the oil regularly and you should be able to drive this car forever.  I bought my car at the end of the lease because there wasn't a better car on the market, I was lucky and could afford to pay cash at the end of the lease, I knew that I could drive this car forever and not worry about sinking my paycheck into it.

<b>Performance</b>
One word - VTEC.  It doesn't sound as cool as a V-6 when you're coming off the line but you can't discount 170HP on a car this light.  I've always thought about lowering it an inch, upping the suspension a notch, and buying wider tires but have never done it.  It's a fun car out of the factory and there are endless modifications if that is your game.

<b>Size</b>
I love small cars even though I'm just over 6'0&quot; myself.  It seats me and my girlfriend comfortably and passengers can wedge themselves in the back seat if necesary.  You won't fit in this car if you are any taller than 6'1&quot;, my head hits the roof if I sit up perfectly straight.  

I've used this car to move 3 times and I'm still amazed at how much stuff I can pile into the back with the rear seats folded down.  For a small car, it uses its space wisely.
