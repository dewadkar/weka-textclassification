            During the month of April of 2001 I test drove a Concorde in a local delearship. The car handle very good, I sent my wife in the other car to follow us just so she can appreciate how the car will look on the street. She was having fun looking every time I make a turn and could see the front of the car hitting the ground. When I got to the delearship they took a look at the car. It was missing a big chunk of the lower body. Because of hitting the groung while driving. My 18 yrs old son said he notice the front and back wheels lean while driving. Further examination lead to the finding of uneven wear in the tire. The air conditioner feels like my mother hairblower was installed in every outlet. The radio could be better (I LIKED THE ONE ON THE 300M) The trunk is a big suitcase never to be fill. It reminds me to my dad's 59's Cadillac El Dorado. During some investigation in a website I found out that the suspension is inadequate for the weigh of the car. During long drivings the car wheel develop uneven wearing because of the tire leaning. In conclusion I will stick to foreing car for the moment. The Acura 3.5 TL Type S, is making its way to the winners position on my list. During one moment of the test drive the trip computer estimated 13MPG.
