              I bought my Suzuki X-90 because ever since selling my 1968 MGB I had wanted a 4-wheel drive sports car.  I subscribed to nearly all the car magazines so I could preview the new cars that were coming out and also the show cars.  I also attended each years auto show in Seattle.  This went on for several years.  Several 4X4 sporty show cars were developed, but non became production models.  Then finally Suzuki came out with a show car and had the guts to produce it as a 1996 model.  I bought mine the first time in December of 1995.  I loved it immediately
the first time I saw it.  I bought it in the Arctic Ice paint color, the prettiest (to me) of the colors offered.  When I got the insurance bill
it was WAY too high.  My wife wanted me to sell it immediately.  Well, in order to preserve my marriage, I sold it to another Suzuki dealer in Seattle.  The next month I received another insurance bill for only half
the amount of the first bill.  I called my agent and told him I had sold the car.  I then asked him why the rate had dropped.  He said the first bill was for the first and last month.  WOW...  I immediately called the dealer back and found out they hadn't sold it yet.  I bought it back for $100 more than I sold it (for advertising they said).  I have LOVED it ever since.  I'm glad I ignored all the bad write-ups the magazines said about it.  Other reasons I bought it is because it only has two seats, an enclosed trunk and four wheel ABS brakes.
  
  The car is just fun to drive.  It is also a great rubber-necker.  I am always being asked &quot;what is that?&quot;, &quot;it's cute&quot;, &quot;I've never seen one before&quot; or &quot;who makes them?&quot; etc.  It's the only SPORTY Sports Utility Vehicle in the world.  All the other SUV's emphasize Utility.  The X-90 emphasizes Sports.  And it is an all-year-round SUV unlike the others except possibly the Jeep Wrangler.  In summer the T-Tops come off for great open air driving.  In the winter, just put a ski rack on the trunk (or use the T-Top mounted one supplied by Suzuki for the X-90), mount your skies and head for your favorite ski slope.  If you run into snow, just switch to 4 wheel drive and go for it (no need for chains).  In spring and fall leave the T-Tops up and add the sun shades if the sun is too bright.  It also does great on logging roads. There is nothing I hate about the car.  I have made a few changes.  I relocated the spare tire from the trunk to behind the passenger seat.  I also store both T-Tops behind the driver's seat instead of in the trunk.  These two changes makes for a MUCH larger trunk capacity.  I also bought 4 of the Suzuki turbine wheels and permanently mounted 4 studded snow tires on them.  In
Washington State, a 4-wheel vehicle does not need to mount chains when the &quot;chains required&quot; sign is posted.  Just have &quot;approved traction tires&quot; and have both axles engaged.  I also replaced the auto-locking hubs with manual hubs so I could tow it behind my RV.  The only thing I don't like is that I would prefer that it be a Targa Top instead of a
T-Top.  In other words, a one piece removable top without the center bar connecting to the windshield.  But it is probably stronger with the T-Top 
and a lot lighter to remove and easier to store behind the seats.

  Driving the X-90 is great.  It is rather rough on wash-board and logging roads but it drives very smooth on normal highways.  The ABS brakes also 
make it a safe car in an emergency stop on snow and/or ice.  Just hit the brakes hard and maintain the pressure till you stop.  They also allow you to control your steering in an emergency stop on snow/and or ice.  I recommend you try the ABS first in a controlled area (empty parking lot) on snow and/or ice to get the feel of them first.

  I think anyone who wants an all-season Sporty SUV would enjoy it.  Of course they are no longer made. The production years were 96,97 &amp; 98.  However it is NOT a family car since it only has 2 seats, as mentioned before, one reason I bought it.  Also don't buy one if you want a  &quot;performance vehicle&quot; especially with an automatic.  Mine is a 4X4 manual 5 speed without air conditioning (that's what the T-Tops are for).  Although it's not a Porsche, it has plenty of power to go over our Cascade mountain passes in 5th OD or 4th gear.

 In conclusion, it is the ONLY production car (regardless of price) that has ever been produced that I would ENJOY owning or driving.  I do own a few other vehicles but they just fill the function they were bought to fill.<br><br>
