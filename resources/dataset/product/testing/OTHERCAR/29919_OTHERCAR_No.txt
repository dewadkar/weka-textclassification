            I purchased my Sunfire SE 2Dr coupe new in mid-1995, my first new car. I was (and still am) impressed by the styling inside and out, it is a fantastic-looking car. Unfortunately, the numerous mechanical breakdowns I've experienced have soured me on this model. After 5 years and 72,000 miles, I have had the muffler replaced, lost a fuel injector, had the head gasket replaced (under Pontiac service bulletin), and now just had to pay for a transmission overhaul. This all on top of the horrible squeaks and rattles, assorted broken interior pieces, the CD player works when it wants to, the AC and heater are lousy and the serpentine drive belt is noisy (already had it replaced too). I understand that new-model cars have their little problems, but major mechanical breakdowns should not be part of the experience. The car is just not old enough for that stuff to happen. I think Pontiac owes me and everyone else who has had these kinds of problems, I know you're out there. Can't recommend this one.<br><br>
