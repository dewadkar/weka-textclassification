            My parents bought this after our other truck finally died.  this one is the Tundra 4x4, 8ft bed with a V8 Engine.  This thing has power.  It is good in snow, ice, rain, and anything off terrain.  Living in Maine it has proven how good it is.  There is a lot of roominess.  The Toyota people finally realized that those over 5'5&quot; drove these trucks, so tall people should not have a problem.  The seats are large and roomy, good for long drives.  It is an automatic, but it has cruise control so, its good on the highway.  Its very easy to drive it has power steering so, anyone can drive this truck.  The only thing that isn't that great about this truck is the fact that the gas mileage isn't that great.  It is a little tough to park with because it is so long, but once you get the hang of it, its not a big deal.   I highly recommend this truck.  Its dependable and easy to drive.<br><br>
