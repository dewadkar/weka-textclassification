            The SUV craze is upon us and there are so many choices.  My choice was the Jeep Cherokee Sport (Manual,4dr, 4.0L engine).  The original.  The one that started it all.  But is it up to snuff?  

First off the exterior.  In my opinion the Jeep is a straightforward looking car, no extra frills which appealed to me.  The recent update that the Cherokee went through made the truck more modern without losing its old school feel.  The roof rack is a *must* so get it extra if you are buying the SE edition.  I didn't get the tow package on my truck and i haven't really needed it.  The only thing that i wish i did differently was to buy the tinted windows.

The interior is nice, but it has its problems.  First off the back seat has limited legroom and it is hard to get in and out of.  The front seats are comfortable enough, but definitely could be better.  The console in between the seats is extremely useful and large enough to hold a lot of junk.  The cup holders are in a good place as well and big enough to hold a large drink.  I have one big gripe though, and this may have been corrected by now, but the extra power outlet is right behind fifth gear making it USELESS.  It can't be used for much without hindering shifting.  The gauges are nice and big and easy to read.  When you put the seat down their is plenty of room in the back.  In fact I can haul more stuff than my mom can in her Land Rover!  

The drive?  Ahhh the drive.  Overall the car is bumpy.  The suspension allows for most bumps to be felt in the car.  Although this doesn't bother me too much(i like the feel of the road), it could be improved.  Sometimes when i make the drive into Washington DC the potholes get to be a little too much though.  The one GREAT thing is the acceleration that this car showcases.  I have never had any problems entering a highway or passing anyone, and it can beat sportier cars off the line.  The stick would definitely be my recommendation to get.  As far as i am concerned the car would be much less fun to drive without it.  The steering is relatively tight.  Like many SUVs the Cherokee is rear wheel drive so when it is slick out the car slips a bit.  Just throw it in four wheel drive and you will have no problem (it is part time in the Sport model).  

Overall I am very happy with my Cherokee.  For around $20,000 you get a great car, especially if you are young.  I am just out of college and haul a lot of stuff around.  Every time i need to move something i have to praise my decision to buy the jeep.  If you are more for luxury buy something more high end.  But if you are there for functionality, durability, and four wheelin' then this is the car for you.<br>
