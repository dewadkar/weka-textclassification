            The Dodge Dakota is a very tough truck. It takes a beating and still keeps on going. I have a 96 Dakota Sport that has been an excellent truck. Living on a dirt road, I would expect for a vehicle to give me many problems. This truck has not had any major problems for the time that I have had it. Not only is it durable but has a pretty good bit of power as well. I own a V6 magnum and you can feel the power as you are driving. Sure it is not as powerful as the more modern 99 and 2000 models but it can hold it's own. On top of being a smooth ride on the road, it is a smooth ride off the road as well. Driving down a bumpy dirt road is not a hassle like it is in some vehicles. Hunting in this truck is good too. It will get you where you need to go with out a problem. I would suggest this vehicle to anyone who likes the smaller size trucks with some power. If you are a taller person this truck may not be for you. I find it a little uncomfortable to drive in this vehicle for long periods of time. People who are looking for a tough dependable truck should buy this vehicle. Those looking for the more luxurious type should head in another direction. <br><br>
