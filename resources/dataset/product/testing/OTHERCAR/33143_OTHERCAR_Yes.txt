            I personaly do not have a new Malibu, but I do have a 1979 chevy Malibu, it's a great car.
I paid 250.00 dollars for it, I have never had any problems with it, and it gets me where I need to go.
I would trust mine over my Mom's new 2000 Malibu.
Granted the new ones might look better, but when it comes to durability, I guarantee, my Mom's would crunch, to where mine would say, hell let's do it again!
I thought about buying a new car a few months ago, but then I figured why have the car payment, mine is still going strong!
Mine still looks pretty good, and I'm not ashamed of driving it any where.
I would say if you have a oldie, keep it.....Oldies but Goodies!<br><br>
