            I just purchased a 2003 Subaru Baja about a week ago, and while it is probably just "new car euphoria," so far I am very happy with it. It is classified as a truck, but handles like a car. It is built on Subaru's "Legacy, Outback" chassis and handles just like them. It also has the same 2.5 liter, 4 cylinder, 165 hp engine as most Subaru's have. Some auto reviewers are not pleased with the lack of horsepower with the Baja, however, I personally have no complaints about it. I live in a hilly area, and have yet to find an instance where I needed extra power. I noticed the automatic transmission in my Baja shifts smoothly. I did not consider a manual transmission because of a disappointing experience with a Forester's stick shift. It just seemed a little "off." I have yet to find a manufacturing flaw with my Baja. It seems to be well put together inside and outside.

If you are considering the Baja as a typical pickup truck, like the S-10, Tacoma or Ranger, don't, it is completely different. The Baja's bed is not large enough to haul 4'x8' sheets of  plywood, and it can't haul heavy loads, with only 166 ft lbs of torque. My Baja has a bed-extender on it, which helps and hurts. Yes it does extend the length of the bed, however, if you want to put anything heavy in the back, you have to get it over the extender. I will say if you want to haul bicycles, a lawn-mower, mulch bags, something sloppy, or a love-seat, the Baja would have no problem with that. With the removable panel in the back of the passenger cabin, it could also handle 8' to 10' 2"x4s" to 2"x12s" with little problem. If you want to do some "heavy-duty off-roading," like traditional 4x4s can, forget it, the Baja is better kept on the road, it does not have the heavy suspension or ground clearance like traditional trucks. However, with all-wheel-drive, it will get around in bad weather and give you good handling in all road conditions. The interior of my Baja is lush with power features, a sunroof and leather seats, not very "truck-like," but very nice and well put together, like other Subaru models.

Car-like handling and feel, all-wheel-drive, and good gas mileage, (21 city, 26 hwy) are elements about the Baja that I consider superior to typical pickup trucks. The Baja is lower to the ground than traditional trucks, and turns on sharp curves easily, unlike taller trucks. It can seat four people, like some double-cab pickups, and has a sunroof, which I've never seen on a traditional pickup.

Overall, if you want a quality car/truck that handles well, and can handle some light pickup truck duties, the Baja may be for you. It is a Subaru, which is noted for reliability, and it has all-wheel-drive to get you around in less than ideal road conditions.
