            I lease a 1999 Avalon Special Edition.  I was looking for a luxury car I could afford that was just slightly sporty. This is the car of my dreams!
Plush leather seats, with seat warmers.  Beautifully appointed interior, silver exterior with sun/moon roof. The car drives like a dream. Great maneuverability, speed without feeling it, super traction, easy turning radius.  The combination of front wheel drive, anti-lock brakes, and a special traction control feature allow this car to perform very well in snow and ice.  It is very roomy in the rear seats, and the front drivers seat has lumbar back support and automatic seat settings for up to 2 drivers.  What I enjoy most about the Avalon is the sound system.  This car has an am/fm radio, cassette, and CD player.  There are a total of 7 speakers including a sub-woofer.  From Classical to Mariah Carey to Metallica to Kenny G, this system sounds fantastic...even when blasting! I highly recommend this car to anyone who wants an affordable luxury car that handles well.  Unlike some other Toyotas, this car is quiet and gives a very smooth ride. When my lease is up, I will definitely lease a new Avalon, unless Toyota comes out with something even better!!!  <br><br>
