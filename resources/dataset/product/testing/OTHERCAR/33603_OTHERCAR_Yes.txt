            I've owned Mercedes cars since 1986--the 280SE convertible. i've owned a 280SL and most recently a 300E.
The 1999 c230Kompressor is exciting to drive..it has a 185HP engine and because it is only 178 inches long it gets in and out  of tight garage spaces much easier than the 300E. The supercharger makes it fast at starts and there is even an extra drive gear to give you the the spurt when you want to get out fast.
The price with leather, sliding roof, special metallic color figures only about $34,000. The  only item not so great is the radio..it works fine, but is nothing to brag about.
Anyone who wants the luxury of Mercedes, but doesn't want to spend the big bucks should check out this new C230 Kompressor.
