            Whats New:

The 2001 protege', is AWSOME to say the least. For 2001, the car gets a new front end ( much nicer ), better looking interior and a optional 2.0 130hp engine.

Inside:

The interior is 2 toned ( LX/DX ). The buttons are well laid out. The leg room in this protege is more than enough and is actually better than the "All NEW SENTRA". The seats are also very well padded and are made of a high quality fabric. ( I had some ink stains that wiped right off!!! ). You can tell that MAZDA wanted quality. The stereo is also great and is better than any other factory radio I have looked at.

All the plastics are of good quality and should stand the test of time.


Outside:

The protege is built to last. The new styling is great and gives the car a little more class. The tail lights are big and easy to see. 

On the Road:

The protege PUUURRRS like a kitten. Wind noise is minimum and road view is great. The car also handels like a BMW (as the ads say). Steering is firm and good. Bumps and potholes are not bad. The 2.0 engine ( optional ) is a good investment. With 130hp, this car really will "zoom zoom".
Passing in the protege, is not task and in fact it is fun.

Overall:

The protege, is of the last family of cars that are 100% made in japan with 93% japan parts. Comparing that to the NEW toyota's, Honda's and Nissans, that contain more than 80% american parts and are actually not even built in japan,
my money is with the protege. I can not see paying for a new car that was bulit in Smyrna, TN. The protege has and will continue to be a better car than its competition. I hope that mazda keeps making this car in japan and will stay away from its ford partner. 

If you want a GREAT car at a GREAT price, get to your nearest mazda dealer and get this car while it is still made in japan. Once ford gets into it, it will change.
