            A few years ago, I owned a Chevrolet that drove like a dream.  I would not have traded it, until a young man broad-sided the car and totaled it.  I searched for a car I liked, and almost bought a 1998 Buick program car.  
My husband happened to see this Cadillac--and two more--on a lot.  He asked me to try it out.  The comfort cannot be beat, the reliability is wonderful, and although it is not a newer car, it uses no oil or fluids of any kind (a minor miracle since it has 142,000+ miles on it) and gets better gas mileage than the manufacturer promised.  
I have the original sales papers on the car, and they suggest that 16 mpg in town and 26 mpg on the highway is about maximum.  I get 24 mpg (avg) in town, and 30 mpg (avg) on the highway.  
This car, for a disabled person with a very bad back, is the ultimate in comfort.  When, and if, I decide to buy a new car, I will buy another Cadillac Fleetwood.  As old as my car is, it looks like new.  There is almost no wear anywhere on the entire car, and it is still mechanically sound.  
I have had few repairs, and those only the normal things, such as brakes, thermostat, filters, and the like.  Only one major repair has been done--I had to replace the water pump.  Well, after 9 years, is something like that not expected? 
My husband, who is 6'5&quot; tall, can ride comfortably in the back seat--even with his long legs.  I have delivered 5- and 6-tier wedding cakes in this car, and never had a lack of space.  Wonderful vehicle!<br><br>
