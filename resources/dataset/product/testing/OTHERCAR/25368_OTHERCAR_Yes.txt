            The Agfa CL30 is a wonderful mid-cost easy to use digital camera. The command dials are a breeze to use and understand. The large view screen allows for great picture composition and is close to wysiwyg. Downloading is effortless using the supplied software and the quality of the pictures is great. This camera is great for just about any amateur picture taking but using this camera to make pictures for use in online auctions is the perfect use. The built in flash works well. The camera is light in weight and will fit in your pocket. Now the downside. This camera eats batteries. You should really get the optional power supply. The memory chip is small and I only get about 10 pictures before I have to download or put in a different chip. But that's about it. A great camera for the price.<br><br>
