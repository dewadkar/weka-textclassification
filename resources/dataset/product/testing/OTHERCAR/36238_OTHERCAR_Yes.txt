            We have owned Mitsubishi Galants since 1976.  Right now, I drive a 91 model car and it's great.  With reference to styling the first one that our family had was a two door 1.6 liter engined vehicle.  Would you believe it  rides well?  

Our second one was a Galant Sigma Super Saloon 1978 model and the design really matured as compared to the 76 model.  It was powered by a 1.8 liter engine and has somewhat sturdy suspension.  

Let me jump to my fourth which is the 91 model.  One thing I love about this car is its speed especially in high gear.  I was able to swing the car to 170 kph would you believe. For a 9 year old car it still accelerates 0-100kph in 25 Seconds!!! The ride and traction is alright similar to a BMW.(I was able to drive my brother's 5 Series and compare.) 

However, what bothers me is the usual oil leak under the hood even when it was just fixed recently.  Example I have just replaced the power steering gaskets two weeks ago and its leaking again!  The thing is, the leak hits my alternator (car electricity generator), because the pump is above the power unit.  Furthermore,  a leak has sprung in the manual transmission unit and you have to pull down the transmission in order to replace it!  Gee, if the Mitsubishi guys just figured it out in an easier way to replace the gasket, life would have been much easier and simpler.

Overall, however I loved Galants ever since and this is our fourth and looking forward to get the new 2000 LS soon!  My Galant still works well for me and it still is a good looking sedan.  Especially when it parks under a direct light you can see the smooth aero design which is unmatched 
by the Honda Accord and Toyota Corona in the same year-model category.
