            I have owned my GS-R since the middle of 1999.  It has been used for daily driving in addition to numerous autocross and track events.  Through very hard (NOT abusive) driving, it has held up remarkably.  The availability of high quality after-market parts made this car an attractive purchase for the price.  This allows the owner the freedom to tailor the car to his or her needs.

Looking for excellent gas mileage and a peppy ride from point A to B? 
Leave the car in it's stock form and enjoy.

Looking to drag race? 
Consider a forced induction solution like a turbocharger or supercharger.

Want to be competitive at track events with the some of the best Germany, Japan, and (dare I say) the U.S. has to offer?
Look into going naturally aspirated with some better cams, lifters, heads, etc... While you are at it, look into purchasing a vacuum cleaner to suck the money out of your bank account faster than you can say, "Now that I'm done, I could have bought a BMW M-3!!!"

All of the options mentioned are only the first part of the equation.  Great benefits can be gained with intake, exhaust, and suspension upgrades, but I only have so much space to write before you get bored...

Let us not forget the last part of the equation that includes adding body kits, paint, decals, custom wheels, electronics, and interiors.  This is not my preference, but it does add some uniqueness to a very common car (the body style has remained the same on this generation Integra since 1994 and will be changing in 2002.)

The car is responsible for the most fun I have had driving.  The shifter is usually smooth and the car gives the driver positive feed back.  Part of that feedback is engine noise, so don't even consider this car if you like drive around devoid from sound.  The Honda suspension is a little soft for a sporty car (in my opinion,) but that can be easily remedied for less than $500.

To be fair, the interior does feel a little cheap (dash and climate controls) and I highly recommend using Lexol on any leather surfaces since Honda leather is prone to cracking.  The first change I made when I purchased the car was replacing the OEM Michelin tires with a better quality set of rubber.  The OEM tires are made with a very hard rubber and offer excellent all season treadware at the expense of poor traction in the rain. 

If you reached this part of the review, I thank you.  Now, go drive one and see if you like it as much as I do!
