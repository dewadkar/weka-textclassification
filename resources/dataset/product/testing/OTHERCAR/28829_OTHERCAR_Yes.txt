            I bought this camera because of Kodak's camera reputation.  I had been looking for a digital camera, but didn't realize the bargain that this camera brought.  It's pictures are very clear, and the camera, is almost self understood, meaning I didn't read the book until I needed to know how to shut off the flash.  The only drawback is the software included with the camera.  It takes too long to upload the pictures into the computer for viewing.  You can use up the 4AAA size batteries in no time flat.  This can be remedied by buying another software that supports this camera, which is not hard to find.  This camera was worth every penny, and I wouldn't have another. . . this is the camera for me.  This camera is easy to use, and as long as you have an eye for taking pictures, I highly recommend this camera.  It is with regret that this camera was discontinued, but don't all good things seem to come to an end?<br><br>
