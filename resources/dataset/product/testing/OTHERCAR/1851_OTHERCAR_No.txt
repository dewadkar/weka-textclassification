            I purchased my Pontiac GrandAm because I have owned Pontiacs in the past and was satisfied and had good service from the cars. HOWEVER I finally got a lemon.  Since I bought my 1997 Pontiac GrandAm (new) it has been a pain in the butt.  First -  the air conditioning stopped working and I had to have a new air compressor unit installed.  Second - While on a road trip 300 miles from home, in the middle of the night the car lights go dim and within 1/2 mile it dies on the side of the interstate.   Third and I hope finally the drivers side electric window has stopped working and I cannot get the window up or down. I have lost all confidence in Pontiac's reliability and am very concerned about taking this car on a trip away from home.  I CANNOT recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
