            I bought my '92 Chevy Caprice in 1995. Before I actually bought it, I spoke to people who depend upon their cars to do their jobs, taxi drivers, police & fire, as well as a few state troopers. (Have you ever gone LOOKING for a trooper?) All had great reviews of their Caprice(s). 

Mine was a consumer model. Chevrolet made three "levels" of this car. &#147Consumer&#148 is the lowest. &#147Service&#148 was aimed at taxicab companies and has some more durable parts. The &#147police&#148 package kicked it up a little more yet, especially on the suspension & brakes. I spoke to taxi drivers with over 450,000 miles on their Caprice with no major hassles. Cab drivers and police officers don't baby their cars at all. Lots of stop & go, harsh acceleration, infrequent (at times) service & maintenance. These cars were engineered to take it.  The consumer model was rather durable as well but the Des Moines Police Department had a Caprice in service around the DM International Airport (flights to Canada) and it ate brake pads.  My understanding was that it was a consumer model also that they replaced their brakes with cheap pads.

My wife was t-boned by a semi-truck that ran a stoplight at 45 mph; he was trying to get home early.  Needless to say, he didn&#146t. She walked away with a wrist injury. That is one reason you don't want to drive a tin can of a car. After the accident, our insurance company totaled the car. It was in 2001 with 250k miles on the odometer and they gave us over $3000. We kept title and sold the car (it was still drivable) to the son of a mechanic who fixed it and still drives it today.  Incidentally, we found out my wife was two months pregnant just after that accident.

We had the 5.0L V8 vs. the 5.7L. I really would have preferred the bigger engine. As it was we still had enough power compared to most of the 4-cylinder powered cars out there, but occasionally it felt a bit underpowered when pitted against a 6-cylinder tin can. At about 190,000 miles it started taking a bit of oil, about a quart per 3,000.  A state trooper I talked to didn&#146t know what a civilian version of a Caprice needed with a 5.7L or better yet the LT1.  

The transmission served us well for the 174,000 miles we drove it. Not even a small problem there. 

We did have the rear end replaced.  Sometimes I wish it were that easy for us as it is for a car.  That was the most expensive issue I had with the car. My mechanic found a rear end (yes, my mechanic can find a rear end) from a newer Caprice and used that. We had to grind the wheel well lips a bit as the newer models don't have the 3/4 well wells. It did take a couple of extra trips to the body shop to correct the occasional tire rub.  Not a big deal.  

On one occasion I towed a pick-up about 250 miles and must have ridden the brakes more than I thought as the rotors became warped from overheating. My mechanic installed cross-drilled rotors to alleviate that in any future tows. He also used premium brake pads. He says the extra life you'll get is better than the cheap pads made in China.  He is also a big Caprice fan and always recommended steps to keep the car running as long as possible.

When I first test-drove this car I owned an '86 Pontiac Grand Am. My driving style was a bit more aggressive than this larger car would comfortably handle. There was a great deal of pitch as we took it a bit faster than this car liked; the salesman hung on for dear life while we careened around corners. I'm certain the beefed-up suspension of the police package alleviates this, but it did slow my driving to a reasonable rate, at least at corners. 

The seats were comfortable enough. I was used to the bolsters of the Grand Am, tie that to the high speed cornering aspects of this car (above paragraph) and I did need to hang on. But in "normal" driving the seats had support enough for even long drives. 21 hours one-way was the longest drive. Several trips 12 hours one-way. (For those of you in Florida, the return trip was the same length.)  Between the seat and the suspension you're isolated enough that you don't feel every expansion joint of the Interstate. The seat was broad enough that you could set yourself in a new position before your muscles cramp up in one. The cloth kept a nice appearance but tended to un-tuck my dress shirts on these longer drives. I'd have preferred leather. 

The trunk was huge but our full-size spare tire cut trunk capacity. For those who like to gamble, you can lose the spare and have a huge cavern of a trunk or find a "doughnut" spare that will give more room. Even with the tire, we had more than enough room for three adults & a baby's essentials (plus a large stroller) for a long weekend. Very nice. 

At one point I tried chains on my car. I took a dry curve too quickly (do you notice a speed issue, too?) and snapped the chains on both wheels (I said my driving in CORNERS slowed down). I drove a short distance so I could remove the chains and they'd beat the paint off the body directly in front of the rear wheel wells. I kept on it with wax and never did have any rust anywhere on this car, not even where there wasn't any paint. 

Our fuel economy made most people sick. They were driving smaller cars for the economy. I matched their mpg and had a much better ride. The highest I ever recorded was 29 mpg. All highway. We got as low as 19 mpg (all city), which was rare. Normally it was right around 25 mpg in mixed bag driving. 

I replaced the cruise control chip for $5 at from a salvage yard and never had another problem with that.  The cruise control chip was much smaller in the 1994 Police Package Caprice I took it from, but it still worked fine.  Perhaps the police use it less?

The windshield wipers tend to lift off the window at speeds over 60 mph. From the same car I got the cruise control chip I got a wiper arm with a wing. Not the cheap, plastic ones you can buy anywhere, but a factory arm that works great.  I swapped the arm with the wiper arm of my Roadmaster before we sold the Caprice.

Watch the alternator and the water pump. We had to replace both. Neither required a tow and I was able to do both myself. That was something I liked about the Caprice. I was able to a great deal of work myself even with my limited automotive experience. After removing the shroud & cooling fan, I was able to stand between the bumper and the engine. Nice to have room to work, eh?. 

A small item, the clip on the driver's window broke. The $14 part was a bit more expensive to have installed, but made the window work much better. 

After I left the window open a crack during a rainfall, the driver's window switch corroded to the point that it just didn&#146t want to work. I traded out the switch for the rear passenger window and didn't have another issue there.  I guess I could have gone back and got a switch from that police cruiser.  I&#146ve have been interested in the engine as well, but someone had already done that.

We didn't have any options with this car. Power windows are standard as well as power locks, ABS & an airbag. Things worked as well at 250k as they did at 76k.  A good thing.

I really liked this car. It had class without drawing too much attention to itself. We'd planned on driving it until it died but took the opportunity to upgrade when my wife was hit. At last report, it still runs great today with over 350k miles.
