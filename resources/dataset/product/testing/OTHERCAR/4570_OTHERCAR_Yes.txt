            I own a 1996 Chevy 2500 4X4 with a 350 Vortec engine and overdrive transmission. It has the push button 4X4 and I must say I wasn't sure of that feature at first, but the salesman told me I would love it once I used it. He was right! I do love it and I love the truck.  It has plenty of power for towing, which I do alot in my business. 

So far the truck has proved reliable and dependable. It's not real easy on gas, but still gets in the neighborhood of 12mpg. Underneath the hood is not all cramped up for space either. Everything is easy to get to if you needed to make repairs. I think it's an all around good truck; the cab is roomy and comfortable. It has a nice ride to it and handles good.

The only problem I have with it...keeping my wife out of it!<br><br>
