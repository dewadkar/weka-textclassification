            I am so not a pick kind of guy, let's just lay that on the table now.  I am an executive who uses my vehicle for business.  I had been doing a lot of work on my house and hauling fun things like rock, dirt and shrubs so I decided to look at pick ups.  I needed something that could haul when I needed it to but still had passenger room and a smooth ride.  After looking around I stumbled upon the Toyota Tacoma Extended cab Pre-Runner.  It's basically a 4-Runner with the cargo space open.  

What a great idea!  It's a 2 wheel drive truck that is high like a 4x4.   It may not sound like much, but you get the clearance and safety without the low gas mileage and added insurance costs.  As for safety, I was at a dead stop when another vehicle hit me from behind doing more than 50 miles per hour.  The truck suffered almost $11,000 in damage but I didn't have a scratch and the Toyota dealer was able to put the vehicle back together perfectly.  You cannot tell that it was hit by looking at it or by driving it.  I have also been extremely impressed with the way Toyota and it's dealers stand behind their products.

In short, this is my 11th vehicle and I'll keep this one until it stops running and from what I've seen of Toyota's that will be a lot of years.<br><br>
