            My wife has a 1993 Mazda 323 (built in Japan) which still serves us well.  It's the most reliable car I've ever seen.  When we needed a minivan for our new baby, the Japanese-built MPV was the obvious choice.

We purchased a 2002 LX model as a demonstrator in November 2002.  We were lucky, it was the manager's demo at a Toronto dealer with 15,000kms and it was clean as new in their showroom.  Paid C$26300 with no freight and PDI; about $5K less than full list.

I consider myself to be a "car guy" and I own a restored 1968 Cadillac.  But I am not embarrassed to tell my car buddies I drive an MPV; it's the coolest looking van out there.

The MPV has handled everything from short errands to a Toronto-Florida trip with ease.  I could go on about the features, but the other reviewers already documented them well.

Some reviewers commented on low performance, but I think it takes off like a rocket if you floor it.  Faster than my 7.7L Cadillac, I might even say.  Fuel economy is fine.  I can get over 700km (420 miles) on the highway and about 550km (330 miles) on a tank in "family suburban driving".

I love the van, but I would like to report a few problems:

#1:  Temp gauge started acting up on a trip to Florida, then went back to normal.  When I got back home the dealer replaced some kind of pulley on the water pump.  Dealer said they hadn't seen the problem before, and that I was lucky I was not left stranded.  Good service though, instead of ordering the part he pulled one out of a van in the showroom and I was on my way!

#2:  Rear brake grinding noise started around 18000kms.  They wanted me to pay $150 for a service but I said maybe next time.  That's outrageous.

#3:  I find the cooling fan exceptionally loud.  Not sure if that's normal but I'll have it looked at next oil change.
