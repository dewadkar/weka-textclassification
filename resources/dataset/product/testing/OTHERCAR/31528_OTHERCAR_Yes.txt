            I have been an owner of a Nissan Sentra in the past of the 1987 model
year. I owned a 4-Door sedan....Automatic Transmission....XE Model.
This is a VERY Reliable Car.....and I had very few problems with it. 
Considering I had to sleep in this car....I had to KNOW that it is
dependable!! It had a VERY ROOMY trunk....with no leaks. There is
EVEN a light in the trunk. The upholstery is very comfortable in
this car.....especially the seats....One problem...the car had a little
trouble climbing hills due to less power because of the design
of the engine coupling to the Automatic Transmission.<br><br>
