            I bought the CDS1005 as a Christmas present for a friend who is a graphic artist. Price was only $99 from RCA website. After some testing, I've decided to give it to someone else, whose image-quality standards are not so high.

Scenery shots are weak and vague. The lens is not very good, so all shots are somewhat fuzzy -- barrel distortion is often apparent. Color runs to a heavy blue cast. The automatic flash is OK, but not helpful beyond a meter or two.

Its software is quite brilliant. Camera appears in Windows as a separate drive, which you can click on to retrieve pictures any way you like. USB connection is VERY fast. A couple of 'delete' clicks erase pictures from the camera when you've got them saved. CDS1005 is Mac compatible, but I never got to try it on the Mac. 

Handsome styling that looks like a camera. Camera size is small and handy, and the build quality seems OK. Controls are convenient and simple enough to understand quite quickly. Batteries have taken 100 pictures (many with flash) and are still showing high on the built-in gauge.

I'll rate it a bit low because of the barely-acceptable and weirdly variable image quality, but it's not a disaster. My non-artist daughter will get a lot of use out of it.<br><br>
