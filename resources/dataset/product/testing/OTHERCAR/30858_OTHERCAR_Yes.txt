            I've owned by 2000 Grand Vitara JLX for three years now.  This SUV is a great car and a great choice.  At the time I purchased, I read all the reviews of so-called "comparable" vehicles - The mazda Tribute, Toyota RAV, and Honda CRX(?)  These vehicles didn't compare for any number of reasons (options, engine V4 vs. V6, and price)!  The Grand Vitara could be had in a V6 with all the desirable options INCLUDED for less cost than any of the competitors, and with shift-on-demand 4-wheel drive which none of the others even offered.  I also liked the fact that the Grand Vitara was based on a truck frame rather than just an SUV shell on a standard car frame.  

Reliability and Interior.  After 3 years, and 30,000 miles, all my initial reactions and thoughts about this vehicle have been reinforced.  I have had just one minor problem in all this time.  The cloth interior has proofed to be very comfortable, even on longer drives, and more importantly, is holding up extremely well and still looks just about brand new.  Passenger cabin space is more than sufficient, and everyone remarks on the amount of headroom and legroom.  The car is comfortable for my elderly parents to get in and out off.  And all the power options are terrific which come standard included in the cost unlike the other models of 2000 which offered these features at an extra cost.  The one thing it could use and may have been redesigned by now is better placement of cup holders.  Otherwise all gauges are well placed and easy to read.

5-speed.  I own a 5-speed which I love.  The car is peppy enough to keep me happy (my other car is a sports-car).  Some of the reviewers have bought up and you can understand why their reviews are so favorable.  Prior to purchasing the car, I drove an RX7, a Saturn SL2, a Merkur XR4Ti Turbo - all in 5-speed.  One of the reasons I initially researched the Suzuki was because it was offered in a 5-speed.  I definitely made the right choice.  

Four-Wheel Drive.  The driveway at my house is unpaved and down a hill.  The four-wheel drive works well enough to get my car out of my driveway in most snow conditions.  It drives well on the road in hazardous weather conditions.

I really don't have any negative comments on this vehicle.  Recently, I've begun to consider upgrading to a luxury SUV - I've checked out BMW, VW Toureag.  I test drove the Subura Baja (cute and sporty), and the Infiniti FX35.  I love the FX35 and am still kicking around buying.  If only more SUVs were offered in a 5-speed for people who like the driving experience.  My other car is an Audi TT roadster.  Other than having a new SUV with luxury interior and all the toys, there's no reason to trade up as I like my Suzuki GV just fine.  Maybe that's why I still haven't made the move.  And that speaks volumes on my satisfaction with my present vehicle.

Just give me better cup holders and HEATED seats as an option!
