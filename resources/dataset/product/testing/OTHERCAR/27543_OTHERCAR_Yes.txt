            First of I have to say this is one tuff SUV.  I definately have not been nice to my Jeep here, but with over 160,000 miles on it, it's still running like a champ, and that 160 has not been easy.  I've taken this Jeep on trails that only people with suspension lifts, dif. lockers, and winches would feel comfortable.  It's has just as many city miles, as it has highway miles, and still when it gets a tune up and new rubber on the wheel it rides as good as new.

I guess I should go through the basics first.  Well this vehical was definately designed with the drive in mind.  Everything is very easy to get to and well laid out, from the power seats, and the cup holders in the center console, to the overhead display and the lighted mirrors in the sun visors.  I have the limited model which includes several extra features such as the climate control, radio controls in the steering wheel, computer diagnostic screen, lumbar support, opening rear window, most of which were options on the laredo, and standard on the later years.

The few problems I've had with it I would not qualify as major, but sometimes were pricey such as when the manifold cracked.  Apparently this is a common Jeep 4.0 engine problem, but it worked out well in a way becuase I got to upgrade to a nice Borla header.  Combined with a K&N air filter my gas milage increased by nearly 30%.  I hope to replace the exhaust system in the future to knock that number up some more, but even thats going strong.  I lost a fuel pump at about 125k, and I replaced the cv boots at 90k, other then that I have not had any other big problems. 

I always tell people it like driving a car, it hugs the road and is near impossible to flip, believe me I've tried.  Usually its not until I let people to drive it that they believe me, but there always impressed.  If the new jeeps coming out are as good as this one has been, I will never have a problem recommending one to friends or family.
