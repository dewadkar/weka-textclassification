            Dodge has really outdone themselves when they made the '99 Dodge Grand Caravan Sport.  I am the VERY busy mother of 5 children ages 2 through 5 and we are in the car a lot!  
Before buying a Dodge there was consideration for a Ford product.  The Windstar and the Grand Caravan were similar in many parts but the outer body styling of the Dodge couldn't be beat.  Everything you could ever want in a vehicle was included without having to &quot;piece-part&quot; it together.  Behind the third seat, which is removable, there is a line of plastic hooks that point toward the ceiling.  Looked like nothing when I first saw them but then the dealer told me they were for hanging your plastic sack groceries on so they don't tip over when you're driving.  I almost didn't believe him!  What a novel idea!!  
My minivan has 4 captain's chairs which I absolutely love.  With 5 kids, 3 needing in the very back seat, the lever to flip the seat forward is manageable enough for a 4 year old to use.  The seat doesn't pop up so fast it hits the front seat...it just eases up which is nice when the 3 year old didn't get out of the way fast enough.
The overhead console is great for long trips because it will give information on miles per gallon, ignition time, distance to empty and much more.  It's as close as it can get too...I pushed my luck on the highway once and let the distance to empty get down to 1 mile before I pulled over.  You can't get anymore accurate than that.
I would strongly recommend the Dodge Grand Caravan Sport for anyone who wants the convenience and comfort of a minivan while still looking sporty and full of life.  This vehicle drives like a dream!  <br><br>
