                 We recently decided to buy a new vehicle because our old car was too hard to lug our 2 large dogs around in.  We had always liked the looks of the Jeep Grand Cherokee (GC), but knew that we couldn't afford a new one.  We found this 1998 Program Car(which is a TSI model), but it met our specifications exactly.  With only 20,000 miles on it, you couldn't even tell it had been owned before.
     I like many of the features of our TSI GC.  The seats are very comfortable.  I have sat in the drivers, the passengers, and the back seat for extended amounts of time and been very comfortable.  The leather seats also do not seem to get sticky in the sun, which I was afraid that they would.  The electric seat functions also make it quick to change things such as lumbar that my husband and I tend to disagree on.
     Another feature that I enjoy is the onboard computer, and the weather, mileage control panel.  It tells you when you need your oil changed, along with what kind of gas mileage you are getting.
     Our Jeep also has the rear window that you can open, as opposed to other models where you have to open the whole door.  A minor feature, but we use it quite a bit.  The rear seats easily fold down to allow more room (which we use every time we take the dogs anywhere with us).  On a recent vacation we had enough rooms for the 2 large dogs, 2 suitcases, and much misc.  
     So far we have not had to do any repairs to it, other than the oil changes.  We have even been shown how to easily reset the computer, so we can change the oil at home.  (I know, but my husband really likes to do it!!)  I have been very happy with my Jeep, and would tell anyone who might need more room and the 4WD capabilities to go for it.  By the way, driving 40 minutes to work every day, the peace of mind that I have 4 wd in bad weather is terrific too!!
