            My Camry is 4 years old and it has never given me any problems. It's always been reliable and I just love it. This is a very low maintenance car. I get my oil change whenever since I drive a lot and have a busy schedule, and get checkups not as often as I should. But nonetheless, the car's been problem free. 
The handling of the car is great, it accelerates fast when I want it to. I have gone over 100 mph in this car many times and it's still a nice smooth ride. The radio and air controls are easily accessible. I like taking this car to long road trips because it's comfortable. Oh, and mileage tends to get better after you've taken it to a long road trip. I was barely getting 20 miles to a gallon of gas when I first got the car. After taking it to LA (400 miles from where I am), it's gone up to about 24-25 per gallon. 
It's a great car and I like it a lot. I wouldn't mind getting another Camry in the future.<br><br>
