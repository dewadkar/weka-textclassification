            Without question, this model of the Nissan Maxima is a great car.  The engine is unparalled in family sedans of the late 1990s, and this engine's power is especially great with a manual transmission.  This car also is extremely comfortable and easily fits my lanky 6'5" frame.  Also, the sound system absolutely rocks, especially compared with other stock systems.  Even better, newer models are equipped with more speakers and subwoofers.

With a manual transmission, this car serves the needs of many people.  It can act as a performance car (with a high 6-second 0-60 run), a long distance cruiser (easily handling 90+ mph for hundreds of miles), and an efficient commuter car (25-30 mpg in mixed driving).  The automatic performs well too, but the manual tranny truly brings out the best in this engine.

The sound system in this thing really rocks.  Although BOSE systems may not be the best bang-for-the-buck for home systems, they have done a great job in the car audio world.  They have worked with Nissan to design speakers that conform with the interior dimensions of the Maxima, and it shows.  Play Def Leopard's Phonograph at high volume, and you will see what I'm talking about.

My only hesitation with this car is the knock and oxygen sensors.  My car started experiencing problems with the knock sensor at 65K and I have since gone through 2 sensors at a whopping $900 per replacement.  The symptoms of this problem are hesitation and poor performance.  Make sure you get this checked out before buying.

If I can get past the knock sensor problem, this car will easily deliver high-performance past 150K (with regular maintenance).  And I assure you, it will be a great 150K.  Unfortunately, if another sensor goes, I will look elsewhere.
