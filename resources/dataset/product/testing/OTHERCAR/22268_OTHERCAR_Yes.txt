            This is a review on my sister&#146s red Toyota Tacoma double cab, which I have driven on numerous occasions.  The Tacoma has been around for a while, first introduced in 1995.  The Double cab went on sale in 2000 as a 2001 model.  In other parts of the world a 4 door Toyota PU is very common.  My mom who lives in the Philippines has an early eighties 4 door Toyota Hilux(similar truck, not sure on the exact model yr) that&#146s still running fine! 

Back to the truck, it is a 4x2 SR5 Prerunner with TRD suspensions.  Wow! Let me get a sip of water because that was a mouthful.   The other option for a DC is the Limited version.  I recommend getting just the SR5 which already has power everything.  The limited doesn&#146t really give you any options of major significance (fancier seats).     

Pros
Looks-to me the Tacoma is the best looking truck out there.  This is the main reason my sister bought it.  High ground clearance and big off road tires definitely give it that &#147I kick butt&#148 image.  Great move by the company to built a 2 wheel drive truck that looks like a 4x4.  For my family a 4 wheeler is strictly for bragging rights, and this truck has never touched dirt.  Besides I seriously doubt many Toyota owners want to risk damaging or scratching their 25-30 thousand dollar truck by roughing it up thru the back woods.

Transmission-is smooth which is good since the DC only comes as an automatic.  She has the V6 version (2.7 Liter V4 is available), and take my advice get the 6 cylinder or look elsewhere.  It is a 3.4 liter twin cam engine which was 1st available in the 95 Toyota truck line.  It&#146s a very nice 6 cylinder.  My 97 T100 has it and my Dad&#146s 02 4runner too.  I'm been very pleased with the minimal maintenance.  Horsepower is rated at 190 and all of it is needed to move the Tacoma.  Acceleration is pleasant but more ponies are always nice.  Fuel economy is just like any other truck.  It gets about 16mpg in nothing but city driving.  

Versatility-with 2 extra doors and more passenger space this rig can double as a family sedan/truck.  It can easily swallow a car seat in the back.  4 regular sized adults should be fine in the DC.  If your short the Tacoma might be tedious to climb in and out of, so running boards should be considered.

Cons
Price-same old sing song.  It&#146s a Toyota and they always cost more than other makes.

Ride-Remember coasting your bicycle down a flight of stairs it&#146s similar to that.  This is the main reason I would pass up the Tacoma and go to the Tundra (sweet v8, much nicer ride).  Long distance driving is tiring with the DC. 

Cramped interior-While the Tacoma gives you lots of leg room for both front and rear passengers the inside is uncomfortable narrow.  My sister could care less but she is 5 foot tall and slim.  My T100 is much wider.  The backseat is a little too upright, a shame since the leg room is decent.

Smaller bed-Even if you use your truck just like a sedan(she does) you&#146ll be surprised how many times your going to wish for more bed space.  It&#146s also pretty shallow all Toyota trucks are.  My 200 pound mastiff will never touch that bed!  He&#146s never been in the T100&#146s either.

Gas Tank-is too small.  Why not a 24 gallon tank like my T100?  My sister always complains about having to fill this bad boy up every 2 days! (Range is about 250 miles).
