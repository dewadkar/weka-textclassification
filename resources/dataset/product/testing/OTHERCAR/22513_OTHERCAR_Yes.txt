            With two kids, it was becoming readily apparent that we needed more room and our Pathfinder (See one of my prior reviews) was getting a little snug. The boys are both getting into hockey and once you load up the equipment, there wasn't much room, forget additional passengers. Not to mention that after only 40K miles I was told the Pathfinder needed new struts at a cost of $900, which I thought was totally unacceptable for an SUV that has never been off-road, but that's another review.

We figured if we were going to make the move we would only do so into a vehicle with a third row seat. My wife, who has been, and would continue to be the primary driver of the SUV demands four wheel drive to deal with the Chicago winters. We know minivans are more practical, but I believe only Chrysler and Chevy offer an all wheel drive version, but quite honestly after getting spoiled with the quality of the Asian products, we weren't willing to take the gamble. I've heard too many horror stories from former Chrysler minivan owners, I've owned a Chevy Blazer before and have driven the Astro as a rental, so let's just say I wasn't willing to go there.

Not too mention, my wife and I really weren't willing to buy a minivan, not that there is anything wrong with it, it just wasn't our preference.

So now that takes us to the SUVs. My wife has always wanted a "'Cruiser", but the list price for a new one is a little prohibitive (mid $50k), at least for me.

As for the compact SUVs, only the Explorer and Durango offer the third row, but again word of mouth and my distrust steered me away. The Suzuki Grand Vitara also has a third row, but it's too small. That left me considering the following:

Acura MDX - Awesome vehicle, but with options it pushes $40K and with a waiting list to buy, the dealers aren't budging on the price. 

Toyota Sequoia - A 4WD SR5 is $40K and that's without leather! Too expensive

Ford Expedition - When all is said and done, upper $30K, close to $40K, and my personal prejudice against Ford

Lincoln Navigator - Way too expensive, not to mention the Ford thing.

Chevy Tahoe/GMC Yukon - I've heard and read positive things about the Chevy/GMC twins, but again, pushing $40K.

Mitsubishi Montero - Equipped right, it could have worked, but my wife didn't like the styling, so that nixed that.

Land Rover Discovery - Again close to upper $30K with options, not to mention a less than stellar realiability record.

So that didn't leave much, until we drove by the local Toyota dealer on my wife's birthday, "just too look" at the cost of used Land Cruisers, if they had any. If anyone knows finding a used Land Cruiser without ridiculous mileage is rare. Anyway, they happened to have two '99s and two '98s. The '99s were close to $40k, so they were promptly ruled out. They were asking around $35K for the '98s, both had around 45K miles - not bad. They had just taken the one we liked in on a trade and they hadn't even done the pre-certification work on it yet, only washed it.

Bottom line we were able to get it for $32K. This was on a Saturday evening. They told us to take it home, but to bring it in on the following Tuesday so they could clean it up (not that it needed much).

When we took it in they did the following:
Replaced all fluids
Replaced the brakes
Performed the required maintenance
Completely detailed the car (awesome job I might add)
Fixed any paint chips
Fixed a couple of stubborn cup holders
Touched up a couple of blemishes on the leather seats
Replaced a couple of interior trim pieces that looked worn

When I picked up the vehicle it looked as good as a brand new car.

As for the vehicle itself, the interior is as quiet as my '01 Acura, if not more so. It handles remarkably well for such a large vehicle. Steering is tight and responsive (again for an SUV), and the V8 does a very good job of pulling this beast, but it's thirsty. I've only gotten around 13 mpg on premium fuel in a mix of city and highway driving. But if gas mileage is a main concern to you, you're not shopping the large SUVs anyway.

I had no concern at buying a used Land Cruiser as their reliability and longevity are legendary, and we plan on keeping this a while. As a matter of fact the dealer had a couple of previous generation models on the lot that had over 120K miles on them (normally they wholesale out high mileage vehicles).

Our 'Cruiser came with the optional third row seats which are primarily designed for small statured individuals (read: kids) but it will seat eight. It also came with the trailor hitch, luggage rack, running boards. The locking center and rear differential is also included, but unless you do some serious off-roading, it's overkill for most of us and will most likely rarely be used. 

Other features:
Power driver and passenger seat with power lumbar
One touch open/close Moonroof
Power windows with driver's express down/up
Power locks
Power heated mirrors
Automatic headlights
Auto climate control
AM/FM/Cassette/CD 7-speaker stereo
ABS
More cupholders than you'll ever use
Theft deterrent with immobilizer
Keyless entry
much more...

So in summary, the 'Cruiser looks to be an awesome vehicle where it's handling and ride make you forget how big this thing is. As someone else mentioned, the seats are extermely comfortable. We haven't driven it through a winter yet, but I'm sure it won't disappoint us.  Dealer service (Libertyville Toyota, Libertyville, IL) for both sales and service was outstanding.

Check with your insurance company also, my policy went up by $500 per year.

My advice? If you can find a good reasonably mileaged one, snatch it up. It's a decent value and they are known to to be able to reach the 200K mile range with rarely nothing more than regular maintenance.

I think you'll be pleased.... We are.
