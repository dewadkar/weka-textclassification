            If you want a car to haul all your junk around go buy and SUV - if you want a car that communicates with the driver at all times and is just plain great fun to drive then this is the car.

I live in an area that is &#145relatively affluent&#146 so I am surrounded by Porsches etc.  When I park this no one pays them any attention but they all want to know what this is.  Driving this is sort of like wearing a SpongBob tee shirt - it just brings a smile to the face of everyone around - especially the driver!

The 5-speed manual is slick with a very short lever throw and the brakes are outstanding and never fade.  The engine needs a few revs before it gets into its stride but since it is smooth this is not an issue and it is plenty fast enough in the first 3 gears.  Cabin noise is a little high but then what do you expect when the engine is right behind your head?

The seat is comfortable and very supportive &#150 useful with the sort of side loads this car can generate.  Frankly, you will be amazed how much room there is for the occupants in this car.  I am 6&#1462&#148 and have plenty of room even above my head - I guess that is where all the luggage space went.  The roof is easy to use and will open all the way without the need to get out of the seat on a warm day.  It can be closed without getting out too.

It is a rear wheel drive, mid-engine sports car so it is possible to push the back too far if you are not judicious with the throttle, but frankly that would only happen if you are not listening to what the car is telling you because it lets you know when you are nearing the limits.  In fact I love to drive this car in the rain because of that communication.  Snow?&#133better get some snow tires because the standard ones that come with it should be illegal once the white stuff is on the floor.

Could it have a little more luggage space or maybe a few more horsepower?  Sure, but I like the undiluted &#145light is right&#146 feel about it.  Best of all my kids can ride in the front because the air bag can be switched off - and they usually fight over who gets to ride in it.

If you want to really compare handling find out where an AutoX is running near you - chances are if there is an MR2 Spyder there it will be kicking the butt of cars costing a lot more.  Enough said!
