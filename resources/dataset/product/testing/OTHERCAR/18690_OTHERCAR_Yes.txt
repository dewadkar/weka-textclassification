            Just got my Olympus 2000 and have had about a month to get acquainted with it.

It has not been a disappointment.

I migrated to and earlier Olympus after owning a couple of other brands of digital cameras that did not match the Olympus picture quality.

I was eager to get my hands on something that had a zoom, memory cards, and more SLR type flexibility.

I was sold on the 2000 after reading reviews and seeing the specs, but the pictures of it led me to believe it was larger than it really is.  Before ordering mine, I went to a local retailer to look at it and I was surprised at how small and light it is.  It�s not a true �shirt pocket� camera, but for all its features, the small size is surprising.  

Some of the things I like...

...Picture quality.  Superb. 
...Potential quantity of pictures that can be taken is limited only by how many memory cards you have.  I have a 32 meg card that holds more than 400 pictures at the lowest resolution, more than 150 at the resolution I normally use, and more than 60 at the best resolution (JPEG).
...Love the little infrared remote control that can be used to either snap pictures or do a slide show with the camera connected to a TV.
...Software that almost miraculously �stitches� a sequence of pictures into a wide-angle panoramic shot.
...Fully automatic for point-and-shoot convenience, but you can also manually manipulate shutter, aperture, focus, and flash settings.  Also, you can choose either shutter or aperture dominant modes. 
...Both optical and LCD viewfinders and the optical viewfinder can be adjusted to your vision if you wear glasses.
...Both optical and digital zoom.  The optical zoom is excellent.  The digital zoom at full magnification can get grainy.
...You can choose to have the camera emulate ISO 100, 200, or 400 if you wish.  As with regular film, the 400 settings can get a little grainy, but it�s a realistic tradeoff between quality and speed.
...One of the things I like most is the ability to take numerous quick, sequential pictures in a row, sort of like a power-winder.   For some reason, from the publicity, I had thought the limit was five pictures, but you can do dozens of pictures at a time, depending on your memory.

There is a lot more, and that�s one of the benefits of this camera.  If you want automatic, point-and-shoot simplicity, it�s got it.  If you want a lot of options for taking innovative and quality pictures, you�ve got that too and, in fact, some features that have never been on any of the SLR�s that I�ve owned.

What don�t I like?   The lens cap, for one.  It isn�t very secure and when you turn the camera on, the lens electronically extends a couple of inches and always pops the lens cap off.  I�m going to get a lens cap connector or else I know I�ll lose it.   Also, the shoulder strap is configured in a way that it sometimes interferes with the location of the shutter, but that�s a minor issue.

Battery life is poor with regular alkalines, but with nickle metal hydride rechargeables, is excellent.  I have taken 200 to 300 pictures without losing battery power.

For all the stuff that counts, it's amazing.
