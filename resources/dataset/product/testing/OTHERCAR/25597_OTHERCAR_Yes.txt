            When my wife's 1987 Toyota Camry finally had to move onto a new home, we researched just about every car on the market and finally narrowed it down to a Volkswagen Passat or Saab 9-3.  After spending a few hours with both cars, we were definitely leaning towards the Saab.  Once we sat down and worked out the final price and lease details - it was a no brainer, the Saab won hands down, and its been a great car for us!

On the plus side, this is one of the most comfortable cars on the market.  We took several 4+ hour trips over the past summer, and could have easily gone another four each day.  The seats are very supportive and comfortable, and nothing is better in the winter than heated seats!
Visibility is outstanding, except to the rear - this car can be a bear to back into spaces.  

The car is loaded with options and features, the only one which is less than perfect is the stereo - I'd rate it as average, and unfortunately the odd and integrated unit makes upgrades or replacement stereo installation difficult.  My advice is to buy the high end stereo with the car if this matters to you.  Heating and cooling work great.

The powertrain is a bit quirky, but definitely does the job.  The engine is whisper quiet and we've never had an engine or powertrain problem in over 30K miles.  The car handles like a dream is a blast to drive down winding New England roads, braking is great.  

I've heard and read comments about some suspension problems, we haven't experienced these and have noted that the cars that have this problem are slightly different than ours.  To wit, our car as a cup holder in the dash and was assembled in Sweden.  The ones we've seen that have the problem don't have the cup holder and appear to have been assembled in the States (look for a GM sticker on the roof hand hold.)  Maybe something to watch for?

The car gets great gas mileage, we average around 25-26 on the highway, and the rear hatch in amazingly big and can carry a ton of stuff.  One downside is that rear seat legroom isn't the greatest.

As a final bonus, the Saab lease deals are amazing.  The 9-3 had a final price $5K over the price of the Passat, but the lease payments were $100/mth LESS than the Passat's because of the great rates Saab offers on their lease.  Gee, which one would you go for? :-)
