            Having owned a '92 323 (an early incarnation), I bought a '98 Protege after being the middle car in a 3-car collision.  The fact that the 323 held up extremely well in the crash, suffered only rear bumper and front bumper/hood damage with no injuries to passengers is the reason I bought another Protege.  The 323 had brake problems - caliper pins were replaced repeatedly, and while I haven't experienced exactly the same problems with the '98, I have noted a sponginess to the brakes and they do tend to lock when sudden hard pressure is applied.  During the time with the 323's brake issues, my Mazda dealer was extremely accommodating in trying to resolve them.  A couple of repairs were made under the warranty, AFTER the warranty had expired.  That's another thing, Mazda has a 36 month or 50,000 mile warranty that's hard to beat. 

Gas mileage is great, though and for the money, it is still a Great Little Car for a budget conscious consumer.  By buying at the end of the model year and utilizing some additional dealer and Mazda repeat-buyer discounts, I was able to purchase my '98 for under dealer cost and the car is loaded with power windows, door locks, CD player, trunk/gas cap latches, A/C, etc.
