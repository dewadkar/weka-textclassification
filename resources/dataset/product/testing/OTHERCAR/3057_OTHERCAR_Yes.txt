            My husband recently got a new vehicle for work.  It is new to him but the vehicle is four years old.  It is the Dodge Intrepid.  The model he got is the four door, 3.5 Litre model with an automatic transmission.  The Intrepid has a lot of nice things I like about it and a couple of things I do not like about it.  

So far it has been a very dependable vehicle.  When my husband got the Intrepid it had 60,000 miles on it.  For a vehicle with 60,000 miles on it and being four years old it has held together very well.  The vehicle is very sturdy and it does not have any &quot;play or sloppiness&quot; when you drive it.


<b>MY LIKES</b>

�<i>Power</i>-- The vehicle has a lot of power.  The 3.5 Litre Engine is more than big enough for the vehicle.  From a stop the vehicle can reach cruising speed in no time.  At freeway speed the vehicle cruises along very nicely and has more than enough power to pass someone when a little extra pep is needed.

�<i>Room For Comfort</i>-- The vehicle has a lot of passenger room.  The vehicle is wide and the seating is helped by this.  The leg room in the front seats is a lot.  In the back seats the leg room is adequate.  

�<i>Controls</i>-- The vehicle controls are very easy to see and use.  The Automatic Transmission shifter is located on the center console.  It is easy to use and is smooth.  The Radio/Cassette ---No CD )-:  is easy to program and the sound is very good.  The instrument panel is easy to read and at night is displayed very well in the dark.

The automatic windows and door locks operate with ease and are quick to use.  They seem very sturdy and well made.  


�<i>View</i>-- The vehicle is very easy to see out of.  The windshield seems very large and there are not a lot of obstructions.  I do not like how low the vehicle sits.


<b> DISLIKES</b>

�<i> Vision</i>-- The car is very low to the ground.  For me it is difficult to drive.  The driver sits very low.  The vehicle is easy to see out of but for me it is hard to see the ground close up to the vehicle.  I wish the seat was a little higher for better vision.

�<i>Vehicle Size</i>-- This vehicle is rather large.  We have difficulty fitting it in our garage.  The roominess of the vehicle is nice though; so I can't comment too negatively on the exterior size. 



Overall my husband is very pleased with the vehicle.  I like it but I am not as excited about it as he is.  I would like something a little smaller.  If you are looking for a mid-size vehicle with a lot of room and power I can recommend this one.  If you are looking for something that is not so big I would look at something else.
