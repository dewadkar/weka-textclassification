            I bought a 1995 Mercury Cougar in the summer of 1996.  I love my car!!!  It is a very dependable car that has a very smooth ride.  It is very comfortable to drive.  Mine has electric seats so you can adjust them just about any way you like.  There is only a couple of things I would change about my car though.  I would make the driver's seat adjust a little higher.  I am only 5'4 and sometimes I don't feel as though it goes high enough.  Also, I have a sunroof which I have had to had fixed about 4 times.  I has leaked quite a few times so I wouldn't recommend having one.  It has okay gas mileage but it is a V-8 so it is just a fact that they have big motors and have average gas mileage.  It costs about $16.00 to fill it up and lasts me about a week, maybe a week and a half.  I bought this car because when I test drove the Cougars, they were sooooo smooth to ride in.  Not bumpy at all.  I loved that about them.  I also like the way they look too.  I have a son and it is a great size for him to be comfortable and roomy in the backseat.  I had a Grand Am before and it is so much more spacious inside.  I have really enjoyed my Cougar and would highly recommend it to anyone.  <br><br>
