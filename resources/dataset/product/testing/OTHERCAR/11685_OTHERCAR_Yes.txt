            This car is very good. My dad got this for me a few years ago at a government surplus auction for $2,400! This is a great steal. The government got a ton of these cars for some kind of police use. It runs great, accelerates very fast for a used car (V6), and has a nice interior. My brother also has one of these and he has a slightly different interior even though it's the same year. 

However, both my brother and I have had problems with the transmission. Both of us have had to have costly (~$1800) transmission jobs on them last year. Maybe it's because they were put through a lot of abuse while the government was using them, but before you buy this you should get the transmission checked.

There's nothing that stands out a lot about this car, besides that it's still running very well and has the fastest acceleration and best handling of any used car I've used for an extended period of time. If you find this for a bargain, I recommend it.<br><br>
