            My husband and I bought this truck because he had quite a commute to work each day and we wanted something new.  We decided on this truck because we got the convenience of a truck for many things but it feels to us like we are in a car.  It is very comfortable to ride in and is quite roomy for just 2 people.  More than 2 would be crampy and not very comfortable. 

 The rear seats are just fold down seats so no one wants to ride in back for very long.  I love the 4 doors that open opposite than normal.  It is great for getting a wheelchair in the back.  I am disabled and this is the first truck we have found that we can both drive and I can get in myself with no help.  We have had no problems with the truck at all and the gas mileage isn't too bad, but we do mostly highway driving.  The price was high but not as high as some other trucks in its class.  

Overall we love our truck and would buy another one if we were given the choice!!!  It is also highly recommended for anyone in a wheelchair looking for an accessible truck.  But Mazda does not offer any rebates on conversions so you do have to pay for that part yourself.<br><br>
