            I have owned my Spec v for about a year now, and for what I wanted and still want I have not seen a better vehicle.  I needed a sedan but I wanted performance and looks along with amenities.
The Se-R's power is decent at 175hp but its best characteristic is its handling.  For a front wheel drive it handles great.  It will hold on tight at high speeds but is very predictable when pushed to the edge.  You would be hard pressed to find any car under 20k that will handle in the same class.
The interior is modern but stylish enough not to look cheesy or cheap. With plenty of room for a 3-4 person family and there belongings.  Comfort is good for medium road trips.  However, the bouncy,stiff suspension can become annoying after any long period of time.
Quality is terrific so far with no problems whatsoever minus a squirel making a nest in the ac fan.(promptly fixed by dealer)
Overall the Spec V is a great buy for the money and can not be beat at $16-18k.
