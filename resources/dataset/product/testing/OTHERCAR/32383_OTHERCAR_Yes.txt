            I rode with a friend on a 2-hour day trip in her brand,new Lincoln Navigator.  She had received it from her husband as a birthday present.  What a gift!Our children were with us, and they were duly impressed with all the buttons and gadgets.  They loved the CD player which actually came with a CD-changer.The leather interior was a gorgeous beige, and relatively clean when I rode in it.  We were on a turnpike, which is  a pretty, good road, but the ride was extremely smooth.  I've made the trip in my own vehicle several times, but not without hearing a lot more bumps &amp; grinds along the way.The only feature which apparently was not opted for on this car was the keyless entry.  One of the side seats folded down for easy loading, &amp; we had a ton of accessories with us (dance bags for each of the 4 children with us, a cooler, 2 large sacks of food, and a box of assorted games).  All the accessories were stored out of the way, in the back, but within easy reach when any of the kids wanted to get into the cooler.Of course, since this was a brand, new car, my friend didn't actually allow any of the children to drink a soda in the car.  Nevertheless, the drinks were within arm's length.If I lots of money or I can win my choice of car on the internet, I would not mind in the least driving a Lincoln Navigator.  Any benefactors out there?<br><br>
