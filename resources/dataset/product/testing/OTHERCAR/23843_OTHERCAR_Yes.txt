            Having been the owner of two Toyota Corollas over the years, decided to at least look at something else.  Tried a Neon which felt like a tin box, so went back to the Toyota dealership.

We test drove the 2000 Corolla and the Echo and were surprised to find that we preferred the Echo.  The engine is much quieter, the gas mileage is great and there is plenty of room throughout the car.  The back seat splits and flips down, making it easy to fit large items in through the trunk, which in itself is very large.

The speedometer, which at first felt a little strange, takes no time at all to get used to.  It is actually preferable to the traditional speedometer, which makes it necessary for the driver to look down from the window.  The speedometer being placed to the right makes it very easy to glance quickly at while never having the take your eyes off the road.

Kids love the ride - they are up much higher and can see everything.  The fact that the car is much higher actually makes it less likely that you will get stuck in snow, and you don't hit those cement bars in parking lots in case you get a little close to them.  You wheels will hit, rather than the bumper.  

There is also a convenient place hidden under the bumper where a tow can be attached if need be.

There are steel rods in the doors for added protection and dual air bags.

The Echo also comes with free Toyota Roadside Assistance.

The only drawback is the larger blind spot due the the bigger amount of "car" between the front and back doors.

It is a great practical little car.
