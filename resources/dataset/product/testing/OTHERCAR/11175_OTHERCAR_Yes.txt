<TEXT>
            i got a used 1983 buick skylark from a friend of my dad's. to this day it has a little over 104,000 miles(original). it is slowly breaking down. but i think over all that's pretty good for a car. it is a steel tank. just to prove that... i hit a cement pole once and it left a scratch on my front bumper. i never worry about if i will get hurt in an accident, i worry about the other person!
i have had the car for almost 2 years now. it's a piece of junk compared to most cars that people drive, but when it comes to passing another car on the highway i always get around them. it has served me well. it always got me where i wanted to go. i think i am going to sell it for a new car in the next few months. i think it would be a good car for beginning drivers. it was my first car, and i will always remember that.<br><br>
