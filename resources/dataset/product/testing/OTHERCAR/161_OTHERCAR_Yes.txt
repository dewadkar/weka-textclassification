            This is an excellent camera.  It provides very clear images.  I have taken it camping on many outdoor trips, and it has stood up to everything I have thrown at it.  Image quality is excellent.  I have used it in settings ranging from an indoor wedding reception to the back of a C-130 on a military operation.  It produces quality pictures no matter what.  Couple it with a smartmedia reader (necessary), and you are set for most anything.  Also, I would recommend some good editing software (it comes with a decent set), in order to edit your pictures.  The only downside is the lack of an optical zoom.<br><br>
