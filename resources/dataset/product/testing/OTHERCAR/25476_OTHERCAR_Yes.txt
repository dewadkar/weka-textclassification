            My family loves the Saturn SL2.  Me, my wife, and my children all enjoy taking a ride together no matter where, whether it be to visit grandparents, go to the mall, the Grand Canyon, or even to local supermarket.  I bought my car two years ago and have fallen in love with it since.

The car itself is dependable, and I have had very little problems with it.  It is a joy to ride in, and it works well on any road, whether there be rain, sleet, snow, or shine.  Everything about this car is modern, and it is very compatible, automatically adjusting to your driving style to make it easier for you to drive and feel more secure about it.

Apart from the car, I really enjoy the people at Saturn.  They are just like they say in their TV commercials.  They're nice, considerate, and always smiling.  They like to put the customer first and make you feel special.  At my local Saturn dealership, when you go in for a check-up you can get unlimited free cold soft drinks, popcorn, snacks, and while you wait, your kids can enjoy a game of Nintendo.

Saturn is not just a great car, but a great company as well.  Both them and the car are dependable and work great with you.  This is a car you will surely love!<br><br>
