            I got the Dimera 3500 from Onsale.com for about $75 with shipping. The camera arrived at my house within about 4 days.
The camera to computer interface was pretty easy, although I've seen much better. The software is quite lacking. If you want your pictures to come out very well, I suggest using a program like Adobe Photoshop in addition. Just to give it those few little needed tweaks.
All in all, especially for the price I paid, you can't complain. But before settling on this model, I'd definitely do some comparison shopping. With a little more cash, you can get a much better model.<br><br>
