            My husband and I love our 1999 Silverado Extended Cab Pickup.  We bought it in March of 1999, and it was a hard find to get one with an extended cab and a full 8 foot bed, but we finally found one.

We bought this truck so we could have something new and dependable.  We needed a pickup truck that would be big and strong enough for my husband to use for his masonry/construction work, and yet comfortable and easy enough so that I could use it with the children when needed.  

It handles with ease and doesn't have that rough ride as our older model pickup or Chevrolet Blazer had. The length of it with the extended cab and 8ft bed can be a challenge for me to park at times, but I'm hoping to master that soon. Controls are all at a good angle to view and reach, including the one touch 4WD button, doesn't get much easier than that. The sleek new body style is nice too, gone is the old square boxed look. 

As for the seats, we have the bucket seats with the armrest console middle.  The seats themselves are comfortable but I find if the kids are in the back and the front seat needs to be more forward and it can give you that boxed in feeling with not much leg room.  With no one riding in the back and the front seat can be positioned further back and gives more comfort to the rider. Of course, this is an extended cab, not a king cab or regular back seat, so I wouldn't expect the same roominess of that in a full sized back seat.  Actually for an extended cab the Chevrolet does have the roomiest one we've seen, and with the wide access third door, it makes access to it quite easy too.

Overall, I'd say it's a great buy.<br><br>
