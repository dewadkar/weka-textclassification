            There does not exist a parking spot that I cannot fit into!

I bought my '94 Miata about 2 years ago and it has turned out to be the best purchase I ever made.  It is the ideal car for this young, single, no kids woman on a student's budget.

Believe it or not but I found it on Hotbot.com's classifieds.  Mine is of the rare automatic transmission variety.

My baby is 6 years old and the only maintenance I have performed on it is the occasional oil/filter change and tire rotation/balance.  It is unbelievable!  All Miata owners I know say that I am just breaking her in and that I have many more happy years to look forward to.

I have a '90 hardtop on my '94 vehicle.  Though I cannot take advantage of rear window defrost due to the older model top, I highly recommend anyone buying a Miata to invest in the hardtop option.  It is practical in winter/rainy weather and transforms the convertible into an instant coupe!  I actually prefer the '90 hardtop design to the later models because the rear window is wrapped around the edges, eliminating the blind spot effect.

Indeed space is limited in the Miata.  I had to remove my spare tire from the trunk to fit a suitcase.  But, for now, I am content to configure my trunk like a game of Tetris - configuring and reconfiguring to make it all fit.  You can even get side window-mounted ski racks!

When friends drive my car, they find it hard to believe it is only a 4-cylinder.  I assume the car's power is a function of it's light weight and aerodynamic style rather than engine horsepower.  Nice surprise.

It will be tough to part with this car in the future - hmmm...I wonder how many kids the trunk could hold...<br><br>
