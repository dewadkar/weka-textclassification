            I'm a Realtor, so I'm shooting pictures of houses - <i>inside and out</i> - on a daily basis. I need a camera that's sturdy enough to withstand being wagged around all the time and simple enough to get every shot without pushing buttons, adjusting knobs, etc.

The USB connection is critical to transferring pictures onto the computer quickly since it's being done on precious battery life. I'll probably buy a USB card reader in the future.

Since I snap 10 or 15 pictures at a time and go back to the office to dump 'em in the computer, the smaller 8MB card hasn't been an issue yet. When we take it on vacation, we'll probably want an additional card.

Even though its purpose is business, having a simple-to-use yet quality camera for home use is also important to me.
