            I liked the Plymouth Voyager we had for 9 years ... I thought it was a good vehicle ... we sold it after 9 years for 5K it still looked good and ran good ... but ..
  Our MONTANA is a notch above even the new Chrysler I drove ... less noise on the highway and rides smoother ... The rear seats are more convenient and lighter to remove... and the power sliding door is one of those things you wonder why they didn't have them sooner they work so good and are so convenient.... and unlike Honda's I've heard about, who are having a lot of trouble with reliability, ours works great with not trouble ... the six way adjustable front seat is better than the electric seat we used to have ... its a lot faster to adjust.... the body is all galvanized and the exhaust is all stainless steel... I even noticed the supports for the exhaust are stainless!
 ... It gets an easy 26 mpg on the highway which is very good for a large vehicle with all the room it has ...
And I looked underneath and noticed that the Tranny is about twice as big as the Voyager's ... maybe that's why I'm told GM doesn't have the problems other Vans have with transmissions.
... So far our MONTANA is as reliable as any vehicle on the road and I think it is far more convenient and comfortable than most.... just all around solid.
