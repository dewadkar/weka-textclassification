            I have a 1994 Saturn SL2. I bought it new and have owned it since December of '93. In that time, I've have put over 105,000 miles on it during that time. The SL2 has been extremely durable and dependable over this period. I've done nothing but routine maintenance (changing the oil and filters regularly, brake pads once, tires once and a battery)...no major parts have been replaced, not even a clutch. The car still runs quietly and efficiently with good pick up for highway driving.

The only negatives are those endemic to virtually every small car I've ever driven. In stop and go traffic and traffic jams, the four cylinder engine tends to run hot - when riding the clutch, I've had to put the heat on, which in warmer weather isn't any fun, but in general driving, the engine runs smooth and cool, even with the AC running.

Its front wheel drive with ABS braking system makes it a dependable car even in the worst winter weather and it's easy and relatively inexpensive to maintain. I've had a '78 Toyota Corolla, an '84 Subaru and an '84 Cadillac Eldorado and the SL2 has been the most dependable car I've ever driven. The '78 Toyota was tinny, noisy and cramped, the Subaru was a damned good car (the hill holder clutch and the headlamps that turned off when you shut the car off were great features) but it's engine ran a bit louder and it rumbled or shuddered at high speeds. The '84 Eldorado had an engine with Aluminum heads that were prone to overheating. I'd recommend the Saturn SL2 to anyone without hesitation.<br><br>
