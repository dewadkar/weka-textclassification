            Ok, maybe this is a little bit of a contrarian&#146s review, but I thought it would be helpful.  We owned the C240 for around a year and traded it for an Acura MDX.  I know, very small car for an SUV?  Let me summarize the reasons:

It kept getting smaller every time I got it in!  I didn&#146t think I was growing that much but the car is very small and there is no backseat room.  We could not drive this car with adults in the backseat.  The trunk room was fine but everything else seemed cramped.  I guess being 6-2&#148 didn&#146t help but it was mainly my wife&#146s car.

The tire rims on the front tires are very soft.  My wife hit a small bump and it costs us around $500 to put a new rim on.  I thought this was weird that hitting a bump would bend the rim, but I did not know what my wife really hit.  Then, we spoke to some of our friends that also own the 240 and they also had to put new rims on.  One friend put two new rims on.  If you don&#146t replace the rim, you get weird noises when you drive.

The inside of the cabin felt a little cheap.  For around $35,000, I expected leather and we didn&#146t pay for it.  The seats and dash felt cheap (like vinyl).  Everything seemed liked it was plastic and even though it was a Mercedes, I felt like it was not a real Mercedes.

Ok, there were many positives:

Gas mileage was very good.
Fun to drive!  The handling and acceleration was great.
The service was the best service I have ever had (better than Lexus or Acura).
The car held its value.  When I traded, I was pleased with the value I got.

Summary

Although I never felt like it was Mercedes, it was.  To me, the car felt cheap but with Mercedes you get a lot of safety value built in that you cannot always put a price on.  If you are considering this car, make sure it is not too small for you and consider the extended warranties.  If I was single or had no kids, and I was short, this would have been a better car for me!
