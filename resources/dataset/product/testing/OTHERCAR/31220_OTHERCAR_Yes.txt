              This is my first SUV.  I have had it for 8 months now.  I tested many small SUV,s before making my choice.  Bottom line, it fits my needs.  The RAV 4 was too small.  I'm a big guy.  It has a comfortable front seat, easy to get in and out of, (just got rid of a Cavalier), great pick up and exceleration, and the Limited edition had the bells and whistles I wanted. It also seemed better built.  I felt uncomfortable in the Saturn, like it would fall apart. 
  But this SUV may not be for everyone.  I usually drive alone.  Back passenger seats are a bit small.  I don't drive highway.  The ride is a bit stiff and this car was not designed in a wind tunnel.  Gas mileage is also high for what I am use to.  I get 18 mpg as an average.  I don't use it for work.  The back storage area is small and unless there is a trick to it, the back seats do not fold flat and you have to push up the front seats so that they can come down.  I'm not an "OffRoad" type of guy but the part time 4 wheel drive certainly helps in the Chicago snow and even on wet pavement.
   I do enjoy the Limited package.  Also the heated mirrors and seats are a blessing on cold days.  And if you're like me, the sound system and back of the steering wheel controls make a lot of differance.  Gauges are easy to read.  It also has an overhead display for mileage, trip info, outside temp etc.....  Overall good use of front space.
