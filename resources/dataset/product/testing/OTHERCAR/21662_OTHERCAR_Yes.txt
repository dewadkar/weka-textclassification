            This car has a big surprise. This fine looking luxury car is very well appointed and is very pleasurable to drive. This car is so smooth and quiet that I have actually tried to start it when it was running. Unbelievably smooth and quiet. Do note that this is the &quot;S&quot; model, the one with the &quot;sleeper&quot; engine, that comes with the Miller Cycle engine. This is an very powerful engine that if you press the gas just a bit will move that car at a reasonable speed. If you press the gas pedal a bit more firmly this car will press you into the fine leather seat and hold you there until you relax your foot or are traveling well in excess of all know speed limits. And it will do all this with great elegance and comfort. The climate control whispers gently while you are comfortably seated in soft leather with firm support just where you want it. There is only a chrome &quot;S&quot; to identify this car as different than the plain vanilla Millenia which does run very nicely yet lacks this very potent Miller Cycle engine. The Millenia S handles very easily in normal driving conditions and with it's very low profile tires is also very good in more extreme situations. in fact you will find it hard to believe that such a large car can handle so well that it is a pleasure to traverse those mountain roads. Over all an excellent car at a very attractive price new and an irresistible one used. It does suffer a severe price drop used, making it a very very good used luxury car.

The only negative is the bland colors that these cars are painted yet there is a solution. A friend repainted her Millenia S as the original &quot;Sandstone&quot; color was a bit drab and the result is that people stop her on the street to ask her what kind of car this is, do note that she drove this car for a year before the change of color. It is really quite stunning in it's elegance. My advise is if you are considering a luxury sedan give the Millenia a try, you will like it. I suggest that you get an &quot;S&quot; model for the fun of it. Thank you Kris<br><br>
