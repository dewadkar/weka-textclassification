            I had a 1987 Chrysler Lebaron prior to this so its been a while since I had a "new" car.  My wife has a 2002 Explorer that we bought with 16k miles on it, and a close friend has a 2002 BMW 3 series, but aside from that my experience with "new" cars is very limited.  Hopefully this won't affect my review.

I bought this car for $19000 ($22600 out the door after Kalifornia charged me for everything).  Yes, I could have gotten it cheaper but I vehemently despise all things related to car sales and had a monthly payment already in mind when I walked through the door.  They made the payment fit and I bought it.  The simpler the better.  

I had been looking for a new car/truck/something for months and never really gave much consideration to the Matrix.  I knew I wanted a hatch back and looked at the Eclipse (bad track record for maintenence) and the new Civic SI (just way, way too small).  I looked at the Matrix over my lunch hour and was intrigued; went back that night to test drive one and bought one then and there.  

The car that I wanted (XR, all sports packages, black) was located about 200 miles south of here.  It took three days for them to deliver it, which was a little upsetting, and it didn't arrive on a truck, it was driven.  So my "new" car had 150 miles on it when I got it.  Bleah.  When they "detailed" it to make it look new they did a poor job; anyone who forgets to clear the door jams and hatch back jams is not doing a very good job.

I've had it less than 24 hours now so I will be updating my review as time goes on, but here is what I can say so far.  The interior is ugly as sin.  I'm sorry, I'm a Gen-X'er and even I hate that cheesy silver trim crap.  Its ugly and in 2 years it will rub off and reveal some yellow fiberglass undercoating or something.  Ugly, ugly, ugly.  The fake chrome trim around the instruments, on the door handles, etc has also got to go.  I am taking this thing to a body shop this week and telling them I want all chrome and silver accent pieces painted in the dark grey color of the dash.  After that is done I must say there is nothing about the look of the car, inside or out, that I won't like.  It is very stylish.  The wheels are a little small but that too can be fixed.  At first I thought a four-door wagon could not be sporty but after I saw this car up close and then drove it I knew I was wrong.

It drives quite well.  I have the automatic.  It shifts without me feeling it at all and is very smooth.  The ride is quiet.  I live in the worst county for road conditions in the entire state of California -- over railroad tracks and potholes and rough road this car is so quiet.  A thousand miles from now it will probably have developed a dozen rattles, but that's just the nature of today's cheap plastic interiors.  And with the 3 year 36,000 mile warranty I can take it back to Toyota at anytime and tell them to fix those rattles.

There is so much room inside this car its not even funny.  Lots of headroom.  Even with the front seats slid all the way back there is a lot of leg room in the back.  Of course you probably already know that all seats except the driver's seat fold down and you'd think this was a PT Cruiser on the inside -- I could probably fit a small desk in the back of this thing if I wanted to.

I anticipated a few things would be wrong and I'd have growing pains with the car -- there is a rattle up front when I accelerate, maybe a loose body panel or something.  I got it in black and there are a few scratches (one of them pretty large) that I will have the dealer take care of when I take it in to have the alarm installed.  I also noticed the dome light is not securely fastened; it is sort of falling out of the cheap cardboard and fabric headliner.  I'll have the dealer look at all of these things and report back how it goes in getting them fixed.

The radio has too many features and I don't want or care to learn them all; I am installing a custom stereo in its place with a play button and a volume knob because that's truly all I need.  I don't want to have to take a class or read a book to learn how to change channels on the radio (and I am an engineer for a telecom company so its not like this stuff is alien to me).  The CD changer is nice but makes funky noises sometimes and my brother had consistant problems with an in-dash Toyota (Alpine) changer in his Avalon so I am anxious to get rid of it.

The only major complaint I have is typical for Toyota -- you can't have just one option.  I wanted the body effects but didn't need the upgraded stereo, sunroof, etc., but had to take the options as a package instead one at a time.  That's not cool.  I think this is the way most manufactures are doing things these days anyway.  Oh well.  The only thing I really wish Toyota would do would be to offer an alternative dash trim (black) and WHERE ON EARTH IS THE LEATHER OPTION?  This car is so sporty its just begging for a quality upgraded interior.

Overall despite having only put 75 miles on this car I have to say I am terribly satisfied and will likely keep it for many years.  Its got plenty of power for me and will be a great commuter car based on estimated gas milege.  It drives like a little sporty Toyota but has interior room of an SUV.  

I could complain about the price but then again everyone will; everyone wants a killer car for $10,000 but the fact is its just not gonna happen.  I am satisfied with what I got for my money.  I bought from a large dealer where I felt like I was just another sale -- I used to live in a small town and my folks' experience with a small, family-owned Toyota dealership are about 180 degrees different from mine.  Buy from a small dealership if you can... It makes a difference.

I would certainly recommend this car to anyone who is afraid of minivans and station wagons (like me) but who still wants more room and sportiness than the little coupes and hatchbacks offer these days.  

I will update this review from time to time.

------ 4 September 2002 

Now at 800 miles I have a few things to comment on with regard to this car.  Any gas milege estimates Toyota might give you are almost certainly measured with the air conditioning off.  In fact, we had a few hot days here recently, and I noticed three things: the outside air temperature guage is wrong, the A/C does not work terribly well, and when you run the A/C you can actually watch the fuel guage physically move as your gasoline burns away.  No kidding.

I had a few problems with the car that I had the dealership take care of (paint chips and the like) and have now had two rental cars.  The first was a Lancer and the second was a Cavalier.  Both of these cars were the bottom of the barrel -- manual doors and windows, no power steering, radio only... Cheap rentals.  Both got better gas milege and put out vastly superior cold A/C than the Matrix.

They were also both superior at handling bumps and rough road.  Here in Sonoma County we have the worst roads in the entire United States.  The Matrix is horribly uncomfortable over these rough roads.

If I knew that my Matrix would not put out cold air, and that the little air I got out of it would come at the cost of my gas milege, I would not have bought the car.  I would still recommend this car, but only if you live in a climate where you won't need the air conditioning much.  Otherwise expect to get 15-18 MPG with the A/C running full time.  I might as well have bought a truck.
