            I just picked up a Vivicam 10 at the local Walmart for $45 on an impulse buy.  (Strange for me, because I rarely ever impulse buy anything -- but it just seemed like it was worth a try to get a name-brand digital camera for this cheap.)

I still need to tinker with it more, but my first impressions are as follows:

The lack of an LCD display screen on this camera is both good and bad.  On the plus side, it really helps conserve batteries.  On the downside, you lose the rather large advantage of being able to preview pictures you just took.  You have to wait until you get back to your computer to see if they came out.

The camera itself seems to be built reasonably well for the low price, but I wasn't real thrilled about the little excuse for a stand/tripod they came with.  The camera doesn't even sit on it centered when you screw it on to the base, and it's just a cheap plastic piece that will likely break in a few months of use.  Something a little nicer would have allowed the Vivicam to serve well as a "web cam" for your PC.

As others have commented, the instruction book is poor.  It runs through a list of what buttons do what, but it's only a starting point.  You really still have to mess with this camera for an hour or two to get used to the controls.  (EG.  To turn it off, you have to hold down the power button for a few seconds.  This is never explained in the manual.  They simply say pressing power turns the camera on and off.)

As long as you consider this camera as a digital equivalent of a disposable film camera or cheap "box camera", I think you'll be satisfied with it.  I've noticed it seems to take better pictures in bright, outdoor light than indoors.  As soon as it has to fire its flash, the photo ends up overexposed most of the time.  If you take an indoor picture without flash, it's usually way too dark.  Even on Vivitar's web site where they let you view sample photos taken with all their cameras, the Vivicam 10 photos shown are ALL outdoor photos.
