            I did a lot of research before my purchase. I wasn't sure if I wanted an s.u.v. or a pickup, but I wanted japanese. And most of all, I wanted to get rid of my crappy '99 Chevy Tahoe LT which cost 50 grand canadian and had 7 trips to the shop in 8 months.

I test drove the Infiniti QX4, and it's cheaper twin the Nissan Pathfinder. They're incredibly well built and luxurious, but the interior is a little small, and it only runs on premium gas. I also drove the Toyota 4Runner. It doesn't have enough power, but if I were to choose an s.u.v. in that class, I'd take a 4Runner over the infiniti/nissan.

I eventually arrived with the tundra. I immediately noticed the mildly conservative, yet in-your-face enough styling.
The interior is one of the strong points in this vehicle. I bought a silver limited with the 6 cd in dash changer and all the goodies. The seats are very comfortable, except in the back. But I don't really care since I only put my briefcase and a few rubbermaid baskets in there anyways. I'd like the seats more if they had heat like the nissans and my old tahoe, but it's not an essential feature.

If anyone's been to the toyota site, you'll notice the comparison with the Tundra and a mercedes E320 sedan for interior noise. The toyota was 4 or 5 decibells quieter. The ride in this vehicle is so quiet and smooth, it feels like you're driving a lexus. That's the other interesting thing: the tundra engine is the same one found in the Toyota Land Cruiser, and the $90,000 cdn Lexus LX470. A slightly modified version is present in the new Sequoia as well.

When I was in the break-in period on my truck I drove it like an old woman, because I plan on having this truck for a few years yet. When you step on the gas, this thing moves. You have 250 horses at your control, with more torque to boot. My friend who drove it up a steep grade commented on how it felt as though he were driving his harley up the hill, with all the power and whatnot.

I've heard people complain about the Tundra's styling, but I like it. The more I look at it, the more I like it. It shares a few design cues with the Ford F-series (shudder), but it has a higher stance and the front end looks much more together and high-end.

I'm also a big car audio buff. I have a '92 civic si I just drive in the summer, with a panasonic deck and a few mtx subs, an alpine amp and sony speakers. The sound system in the tundra is incredible, especially for stock.
