            I have been reading these reviews, and I have checked three times to make sure it is the same camera!!!  I have owned this camera since September, and I have NOT had the same experience as these other fine people.

1.  Image quality:  This camera was an upgrade for me.  I am not a professional photographer, so my upgrades are never to the newest technology available, but I like my pictures to be quality and shareable.  I have gone from a camera that was not worth printing the pictures ever, to one where you could print a snapshot, but it was pixelated, to this one.  I have printed 8x10 pictures, and they are beautiful; the image is crisp and the colors are bright.  One person even mistook one of my "portraits" for a professional one.  

2.  Battery life:  The batteries that came with the camera were already half dead.  I had the same experience, trying to figure out how the camera worked (without reading the user manual) and after just a few pictures the batteries were dead.  I put in my rechargeables that I had on hand from the last camera.  I have not times how long they last, or how many pictures I can take, but it has never been an issue, and I always take pictures with the LCD screen on.  I take the camera to work sometimes, and my daughter takes it to her Girl Scout meetings and outings.  Neither of us have had a problem with the batteries dying and leaving us without the ability to take a picture.

The only thing I see so far as a negative is outdoor pictures in overcast conditions.  All the pictures I have taken under these conditions appear overexposed.  It may be just a setting issue, but it is one that I haven't worked out yet.

I don't use the zoom feature.  It is digital zoom, so you can get the same effect by taking the full picture and cropping with your image editor.

I like the self timer.  It is so easy to use, my 7 year old daughter figured it out.
