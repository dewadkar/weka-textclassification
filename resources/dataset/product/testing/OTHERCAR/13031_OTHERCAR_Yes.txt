            Volvo has, without a doubt in my mind, the best value for a luxury vehicle.  My wife's car needed to be dropped into the Ohio river because of the three wrecks she has had. She was driving a '96 Toyota Camry, which was a great ride, before the wrecks, but we were looking to dump it and upgrade.  So we began our search.  Needless to say we test drove every vehicle known to man.  It was a 2 month search. We went from the BMW 3 series to the 5 series.  From the Audi A4 to the A6.  We even gave the new Volkswagon a spin.  We finally went to Volvo (safety was a priority for us considering her driving history).  My wife was concerned with the &quot;Mommy&quot; connotation that Volvo has.  We first drove the S70.  Not bad, but when we drove the S-80, we fell in love.  The car is big and roomy.  The seats are plush and comfortable.  The interior and front dash was well thought out and designed with every need taken into consideration. The radio is easier to reach than the S-70 and other features seem to have luxury in mind. Compare the 5 series BMW and the Volvo S-80 and you will agree that the Volvo presents a much stronger value at a better price.  My recommendation is that you test drive this car. It is a &quot;must&quot; if you are in the market for a luxury vehicle.  And as far as the &quot;mommy&quot; connotation, my wife said &quot;when you are this comfortable, who care what people think.&quot;   <br><br>
