            The ML430 is Mercedes V8 version of it's venerable ML320. This is the vehicle for those who aren't interested in mere &quot;functionality&quot;. While the ML320 may be fine for grocery-haulers and upperclass soccer moms, the ML430 adds the extra &quot;umph&quot;---in the form of heightened exterior styling, better options, and of course, the wonderful V8 engine. The first time I drove this vehicle it was hard to imagine that it was actually an SUV. THe ride is amazing, it corners more like a sedan than a SUV, and yet, the few times that I've taken it off road, it has performed superbly. And don't get me started on the engine. THe combination of traction control and such a hauler of an engine is a bad combination for us boy-racers! I highly recommend this automobile.<br><br>
