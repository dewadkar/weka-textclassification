               I bought this car in the fall of 1996 when it had 36,000 miles on it. It now has 153,000 on the odometer. I can't complain one bit. This car has been extremely reliable. Along the way I've had to replace the top a couple of times; once because the canvas started to go and the second time due to vandals who slashed it to break in :-( Unfortunately, the top does leak a little. Of course, it just happens to be at the front end of the driver-side door so it drips right on my seat (doh!). I had it painted not long ago because Dodge screwed up with the clear-coat at the factory (OK by me because now it's Prowler silver). I upgraded the wheels/tires because the old ones dented from hitting potholes. I've got 205/55 16's on it now. They're an inch larger in diameter and about an inch and a half wider. This car handled well before but now it's a dream with the larger tires. Being a convertible, it's fairly heavy (almost 4,000 lbs) which adds to the good handling, especially at higher speeds on the highway (wind doesn't blow you all over the road) which is good considering that the optimum cruise speed of this engine is between 75 and 90 MPH. The only down side is that I had to replace all four shocks because of the car's weight (I upgraded to Monroe Sensatracs). The turbo four cylinder kicks butt as far as torque and top-end horsepower. In fact, I raced my friend's 3.0L V-6 Shadow convertible in a 1/4 mile and won by about 2-3 car lengths. Not to mention that at 153,000 miles the engine runs as strong as the day I bought it. Dodge was smart to use an engine with a cast iron (instead of aluminum) block. This thing's engine is practically bulletproof. The 3-speed automatic has served me well also. It just started slipping at about 150,000 miles. The turbo still works too, believe it or not. With this many miles, that must be a record.
