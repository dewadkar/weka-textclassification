            I've owned a '01 Diamante LS for one month now. I compared it to the Audi A4 Quattro and the BMW 325i. Although the Diamante name does not carry the prestige of the German cars, the Diamante is MORE car for the money. In order to get a comparably equipped Audi or BMW, I found that I would have to pay about $7k more. The build quality is excellent, the interior layout is more stylish and modern than either aforementioned German sedans, the factory CD 8 speaker stereo is better sounding, and the interior and trunk room is much greater. Acceleration is instant and brisk. Once the transmission learns your driving habits, upshifts and downshifts are right where you expect them. I drive with a heavy foot, and the transmission accomodates my driving style quite well.
The only drawbacks that I have found to date (I have put 1000 miles on the car) are the lack of a rear seat pass through, and extended sun visors (the A4 & 325 don't have them either.) Another drawback is the door design - there are no window frames on the doors. While it creates a more streamlined look, I'm afraid the windows may become loose after a while (I am remembering back to problems with mid-'70's GM cars with the same design. However, they were GM cars.) I think if the windows are not use to close the door, then it may not be a problem.
Finally, a close relative has owned an LS since 1997 (the first year of the current body style - it may have been 1998). She has 150,000 daily commuter miles on the car and has never had a mechanical problem. She has also told me that she plans on purchasing another one to replace the current one. (Her door windows have not become loose either.)
I think negative opinions have come from individuals that have not spent enough time with the car. I am not a Mitsubishi fanatic, and was really in the market for an Audi A4. My wife asked me to give the Diamante a serious look, and I'm glad she did.
