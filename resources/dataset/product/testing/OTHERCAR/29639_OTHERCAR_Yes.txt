Canon EOS D30

Well Iï¿½ve done just up-graded my digital camera again, not that I was un-happy with my Epson and my Kodak DC. I simply wanted to try the Canon EOS D30.  

A friend of mine owns one and he never stop bragging of how good it is. I saw some of the shot he took with it and I must say that I was impressed with the results.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Canon EOS D30 is the first digital camera that captures images using a CMOS chips instead of a CCD. I feel that for the quality of this camera it is a very good deal at the price it is selling on the market, the reason I say this is
because the EOS D30 comes with a slew of high-end features that are mostly found on much more expensive apparatus.

The EOS D30 is fully compatible with all Canon EF lenses which ads 1.6X magnification. The camera will store images in JPEG or RAW format on CF Type I or II cards.

The body is made of a lightweight compact polycarbonate with a stainless steel chassis. This makes the Canon EOS D30 a very sturdy camera.

I still kept my Kodak PC 500, for the rough stuff excursion in the jungles of Asia of the forest of North America but my Canon EOS D30 is the camera I use for the regular camera
