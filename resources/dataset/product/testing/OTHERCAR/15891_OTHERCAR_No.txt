            Everyone who owns a Saab has a sob story.  Over a year ago i was looking for a vehicle to replace my old pickup.  I was looking for something sporty, but before i could find anything my dad gave me a call telling me about some incredible deal.  One of his friends knew someone selling a Saab 9000 really cheap.  Since i didn't like Saab's it took alot of convincing to make me even look at the car.  It was a fairly nice car.  It was clean looking, and had every gadget you could think of. All these bells and whistles made me consider the car, but the price was what sold me.  
     The guy selling it was moving to Alaska that night, he had about 5 hours to sell the car before he was suppose to fly out.  I picked up for 2,500.  That's right $2,500 for a 91 saab 9000 with fairly low miles.  I thought i was getting the deal of a life time. The first few weeks were very happy for me and my new car.  Soon things went south, very south. Not only did i have to take it to a Saab certified mechanic if i wanted the vehicle to get the proper service, but things started to break.  The first thing that broke was a motor mount.  Two of the three bolts holding it on fell out, the third one ripped clean through.  Me and my father made a make shift repair, but soon the remaining two bolts that we replaced ripped out also.  We had that replaced for a few hundred dollars.  Then the coils went out.  Saab's don't have one coil like most cars, they have one for each cylinder.  To get them replaced was a few hundred more dollars.  Then another motor mount broke.  This time they it was on the bottom of the engine, and it would be about 800 to fix because they would have to hold the engine up on a lift to replace it.  I also had the muffler go out.  To replace with saab parts would be nearly 500.  I had it done at a muffler shop with non saab parts for a little over a hundred. These were just the mechanical problems.  There were several electric problems.  The sunroof switch broke.  So the sunroof would open sometimes but not others.  Or it would open and not close.  Then a digital display on the dash went out.  It wasn't a necessary gage, but it was sure nice to have and very expensive to fix.  At one point or another i had to fix or jimmy rig nearly everything on the car.  I keep my cars well maintained but with this car it didn't seem to matter.  Everything just broke on it. This is why i have a sob story.  While it was nice to own an expensive sedan, it wasn't nice to keep it running.  I would never recommend a saab to anyone.  The flash isn't worth the cash you spend on it.  <br><br>
