            My Golf 1.8T GTi is the best car I've ever had. 2 years on and 50,000 miles I enjoy driving it now as much as when I first had it new. It's a company car. Having test driven a Passat, Mondeo, Vectra, Volvo S40, Audi A3, I chose the 5-door Golf. Easy to drive in town, fast, good handling, good looks, pleasant on long journeys. The reason I most like it is it's easy to live with, it's not the fastest car on the road, it's not got the best sports handling, it's probably not the quietest, but as an overall car I've not found one to match it.

It's acceleration is good, especially at the low end of the revs, in other words, I don't have to work the engine up the rev counter to accelerate. Think about this when reading reviews in car magazines. Some cars will have a better 0-60 acceleration but often this isn't used in day to day driving, we don&#146t all want to push the revs up to the red line. Similarly, the car doesn't have a particularly firm sports set up on the handling. This means you don&#146t bump along in day to day driving, but there&#146s enough there to handle most situations and the steering isn&#146t heavy.

In terms of cost of ownership or value for money, being a company car I can&#146t speak authoritatively on that. Keep a watch on the tyres, they seem to wear out sooner than other cars I've had. Reliability has been good, with just standard services at 10,000 miles. The air-conditioning unit needed replacing at 35,000 miles.

Very good gearbox with knife through butter gear changes, second gear is sometimes a bit sticky when the engine is cold. Lots of small design pleasures. The blue fascia, spring mounted grab handles, lit mirrors, variable intermittent wipe speed, foot rest for either feet in the foot well (very useful with cruise control), 

Only a few things I&#146d question. Firstly, because the handling isn&#146t too firm and gives an excellent ride in general the car does wallow a bit on long curved slip roads, though the Recaro seats hold you in well. Secondly, a minor point, you can&#146t put the fog lights on the rear without putting the fog lights on in the front. Legroom in the rear for tall people is a bit restricted.

Then again how many times do you go on a long curve bend, carry tall people in the back and have your rear fog lights on.
