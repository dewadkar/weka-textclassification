            The new 2000 elantra is a wonderful little car for around town.  It has a comfortable 140 HP similar to many other cars in its class and a nice feel in the steering.  The ride is fairly smooth, and the interior is spacious for its overall size.  The best part about this car is the five year/ 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.  When my wife and I started looking for a new car we decided that the biggest selling feature on this vehicle was the fact that, while we would have to pay over a period of time (as most individuals do) the car would be covered for the entire time that we were paying for it.  In addition to the five year warranty there is also a ten year/ 100,000 mile warranty on the drive train.
     There were a few problems with the car.  The most notable was the engine noise.  This car has a 2.0 four cylinder engine, very similar to the one on my '89 Nissan Stanza, and makes as much noise as my Stanza which has a small exhaust leak.  This, however, is still a very small annoyance when compared to the over all price and the warranty that comes with it.  I highly recommend this vehicle if your are in the market for a compact.
