            I've been leasing Toyotas for about 10 years now. My family has also owned several. I am thinking of buying the 1998 Corolla I am presently leasing which is unusual because I generally get tired of a car. When the lease is up... I think I'll keep it. My husband purchased a Toyota Truck last year. When he went to pick it up... we drove in with our 1978 Corolla Wagon!!!!!! All the sales people were pressed up against the windows and I have to tell you... they really were PROUD!!! My daughter took the wagon for her first car... It finally bit the dust... rest her soul... but I neverknew a car could last THAT LONG!!! Hurray for Toyota! So wonderful to have a car that NEVER gives ANY PROBLEMS!!!!! I couldn't imagine driving anything else.<br><br><br>
