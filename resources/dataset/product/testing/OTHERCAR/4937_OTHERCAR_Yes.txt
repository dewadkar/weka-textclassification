            I had a dream this afternoon, that all of god's people would join hands, and do something about faulty auto parts, bad workmanship, and high auto prices. 

I wanted to write about my experience with my 1997 Chevrolet K1500. If you are looking for details, I will be happy to give you a few. 

This truck has a 8 cylinder V8 Vortec motor. If you are looking to buy a used truck please test drive a 96 without the vortec, and then drive a truck with the vortec. You will buy the truck with the vortec motor. The vortec improved horsepower by 60.

"Vortec," these potent powerplants put up the following big numbers: Vortec 5700 V8 -- 250 horsepower, an increase of 50 horses, Vortec 7400 -- 290 horsepower, up 60. The numbers after the word Vortec indicated the engine size in cubic centimeters, which is easy to convert to liters; for example, the Vortec 5700 V8 displaced 5,700 cubic centimeters or 5.7 liters."

Another improvement is the passenger side airbag. I do not believe they had one in the 1996. Hopefully you will never need it. 

My particular truck is a short bed, king cab, and would not recommend anything else, where would you put you stuff? If you have kids or plan to have actual people back there, it is not recommended by me. 

I have no problem climbing in and out of the front seats though, and this truck is one of the most comfortable rides around. I cannot comment on the stock seats though. I have improved the seating with Flexisteel seats, and love them. 

As far as any problems navigating the interior, I have no complaints. Sometimes the gear shifter gets in the way, or maybe it is because I rest my hand on it when I fiddle with the radio. Very annoying when it shifts..

Speaking of shifting, my truck has a four speed automatic transmission with overdrive. I have not had a problem with the actual mechanical transmission but have had problems with the computer (or whatever) or little gnome that controls the transmission.

It is definatly a truck, takes awhile to stop it. The brakes are great, but it is a heavy vehicle compared to smaller trucks and cars. 

I feel awfully safe driving, someone said to me, do you feel more of a man because you got a "bigger SUV" than my neighbor? My reply was this, no, just safer, have you seen how they drive?

My truck gets about 12 miles a gallon. If you want to save gas, do not buy this truck. Simple as that. I have made some improvements to my truck that have lessened my gas mileage. 

Now, if anyone is still reading this, I want to get to my point before I completely lose you.

Ever heard of a <b>Steering Sensor?</b> Chevrolet had a bright idea, stiffen the steering at high speeds, makes sense right? You dont want a little jerk of the wheel to make you fly off the road do you? Then, on the other hand loosen the steering or, give the steering more power when you are sitting still or going slow, so you can turn your tires at a complete stop.

Chevy put in a steering sensor or stabilizer on the steering column. Mine has gone out three times. If any of you reading this are experiancing a tight steering wheel, then a loose wheel on turns, mostly right turns, this is probibly your problem. For some reason it fluxuates between tight and loose on right turns at about 45-55 miles an hour. It is very dangerious. If this is happening to you <b> PLEASE CALL THIS NUMBER

Inside the U.S.:
1-800-222-1020

Please call chevy and make a complaint. This steering sensor was made a "technical bulletin" and all that means is it is a problem and chevrolet made a better part for it. Now, after 3 new parts, I have another one going out. I know I am not the only one with this problem. Also, it took me hours of research to find out the problem originally, I would have loved to have read this when I was searching for a solution.

As far as repairing the steering sensor, I was told I could not do it because I could set off the air bag. This is why I am saying you should not do it. Needless to say, I do not think you will set off the air bag if you disconnect the battery first. 

On the steering column itself is this little steering sensor, after you have the column loose you need not worry about anything else, except getting the "ring" off the column and the new one hooked back up. If I can do it, you can too. But, don't do it (disclaimer if you set off your air bag)
If everyone calls chevrolet, I would hope they will have to do something. It is dangerous and they should be held accountable. 

I also have another problem. If there is anyone out there with a solution please let me know. When I run it in cruiz control for about 30 minutes, then slow, the transmission clunks and acts terrible. If I stop and shut off the truck, and start again, it is fine. This ONLY happens in overdrive. It is a sensor of some sort I am sure. 

There, now you have a my little Chevrolet K1500 story. I love my truck and would buy another one. I have had plenty of problems though, just like any car, at about 85 thousand miles, I lost my fuel pump and alternator. 

To any advisors out there, if you dont like this review fine. I have a few points to make, and I know there is a million little boring stats to list off, ( 19.4 gallon gas tank) but there are other places for that information. I want to try and make a difference with Chevy, and if I only help <b> one person </b> who is searching for their steering problem than I am happy.

I am in no way an expert in automobiles.
