            I would never have considered a Volvo.  Safety is well down my list of priorities, not having had a real accident in 18 years.  Performance matters a lot to me, and the Volvos I had ridden in and driven would be an insult to the word &quot;sluggish.&quot;  And a box on wheels is not my idea of automotive design.  I can only assume that others felt the same, and that this explains why Volvo made the C70.

I bought a new 1998 C70 two years ago.  I have the hardtop with a manual transmission (which I had to special order).  This is a wonderful vehicle, the best in its (admittedly small) niche.  It is very quick.  (I strongly disagree with an earlier reviewer's criticism of its acceleration.  Perhaps the standard transmission makes a big difference, but the auto magazines' reviews also uniformly praise the car's quickness.)  It cruises comfortably at more than 100 mph.  The interior is much better appointed and more luxurious than the more expensive BMW competitors.  Handling is solid.  Steering is almost neutral (slight understeer), and the suspension and (expensive) tires really keep the car stuck to the road.  Fit and finish is in a class with Infiniti and Acura.  Engine noise is minimal; road noise about average for this class of vehicle (noisier than the Lexus.)  I find the understated style appealing, though certainly not up to the art-in-sheet-metal standards of Jaguar.  Mileage is fair; about 24 mpg average over the two years, with a mixture of city and freeway travel.  My only real criticism is rear visibility in parking lots.  If you turn around (as I always have), the high headrests create blind spots.  You have to keep your eyes forward and back up using the mirrors.  This habit takes months to acquire.  I also needed a scuffed rear bumper to reinforce the habit.


This is a niche car.  Although the back seat is comfortable, ingress and egress are clumsy.  Trunk space is limited.  I therefore would not recommend this car to someone with children.  This is a car for one or two adults to appreciate.<br><br>
