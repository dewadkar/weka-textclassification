            When my husband first said he found a 1996 Lincoln Continental for me, I thought of the old granny cars.  But when I went to look at it, I fell in
love with it!! The interior got my attention first. All the little do-dads
to play with. And you can't resist those soft comfy seats.  I have a little girl, so it's easier getting her in and out of her carseat.  
 The thing that worries us the most is the air suspension. I hope it doesn't go out before I get to trade it in for a newer one.  Sometimes when it's cold it makes a lot of noise to level itself, but otherwise it's 
fairly quiet.  I have 72K miles on it, so far it's been a great car(knock
on wood). 
When I'm driving my vehicle, I feel great!! Some people that I work with says why didn't you buy a sports car?  I say &quot;been there done that&quot; I don't think I'd ever go back to those bumpy, rattling, small cars.  
We have to drive to Wisconsin for vacation this year, and I can't wait for
the comfy ride!!!
 I think anyone that would enjoy a great car would love the Continental.<br><br>
