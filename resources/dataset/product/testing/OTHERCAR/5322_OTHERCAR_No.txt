              MY sister has had a 4 door honda accord since 1998. Bought new off the lot, my parents felt it would be a perfect car for a girl who just turned 16.  They were correct on their assumption.  

  This vehicle is very safe, equipped with driver and passenger side air bags.  The insurance rate is very affordable and the vehicle gets very good gas money.  The interior is relitivley roomy, and pretty comfortable.

  The only downside i can find is that the 4 cylinder model does not pick up speed very rapidly.  However, depending on how you drive this might be a good quality.
