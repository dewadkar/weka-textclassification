            I'm very sorry that I got this camera for $200 last year... I feel I was ripped off big time.  I needed a digital camera and I wasn't going for professional quality at the time, so I paid the price.

It is hardly user-friendly, which it claims to be and after a month of using this camera, I had errors coming out the wazoo.  I only took about 20 pictures, trying to delete every picture when I was done with it.  Even with this amount, I continually got error messages about the memory.

Even saving 20 pictures on the camera would be okay, if you could store them at higher resolutions.  The poor resolution results in a small size of the picture files, yet this camera still had memory problems after only 20 pictures.  Also, when transporting these pics to a PC they looked even worse than they did on camera!

Taking pictures on a nice day usually gets a nice greenish tint on your photos due to the sun's rays being introduced into the cameras low quality lens. Taking pictures at night is also impossible due to the lack of a flash.

Digital camera with floppy disks, in my opinion, are much better than any of Casio's stored memory.  At least with floppies, you can take more than one along with you in the case that you want to take a lot of pictures.

In the end (after a couple of months), this camera got completely stuck in error every time I tried to power it on.  I've tried to get it fixed, but I can't even get off the error screen.  I can't wait until I get a new camera. As a beginner I figured I wouldn't need a higher quality camera for an extra couple hundred bucks. I was definitely wrong. While you may think that the higher quality cameras are only for the pros, you're mistaken.  One look at the quality of my photos and you know my camera's a piece of trash! (whether you're a professional or have never even seen pictures in your life)
