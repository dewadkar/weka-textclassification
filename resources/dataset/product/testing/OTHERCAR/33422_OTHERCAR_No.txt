            I got my 1999.5 VW New Jetta in tornado red in May of '99, and I still have it (today being 16 October 03).  I've taken the car on many roadtrips, and it's been a little champ on the highways--the 4-banger is peppy enough without getting me into too much trouble, and the seats are firm and supportive without that Mercedes-stiff-benchiness.  There are some positives, I think--styling is great without being flavor-of-the-month ostentatious.  I think it looks as good today as it did the day I bought it, and I still get many compliments about it.  The interior is well-designed and laid out, and the sound system works well.  Backseat room is tight and not recommended for long hauls with adults back there--you'll really feel their knees if you're the driver.  Headroom isn't affected negatively by the sunroof--a problem in many other vehicles.  I'm 6'5" and tend to notice these things.  With the multi-adjustable driver's seat, headroom's no problem.  Additionally, the car is mechanically excellent, and I have never had a single problem with anything under the hood.

The same cannot be said, however, for the electrical system.  I have never had a new car that needed as much back-to-the-dealer electrical attention as this car.  Many things were covered under warranty (but it's still a hassle to keep going back for repairs when you've got a NEW car).  I had to have the car's entire computer system replaced as well as the oxygen sensor, airbag sensor, and passenger's window system replaced in the first year.  Since then, I've had to have the passenger's window system replaced again (the window comes out of its track and then the entire computer system has to be replaced; it's expensive)--the dealer said to me, "We see this all the time on these cars."  Ugh.  If this is true I don't know why the company hasn't issued a recall like they did with the darned oxygen sensors.  I had to have the oxygen sensor system replaced again, and they (VW America) initially made ME pay for this until I wrote them a letter mentioning how another dealer said the oxygen sensors "always give out on Jettas."  Then I got a check from VW America.  And then VW issued a recall for the oxygen sensors anyway.  I've had some real problems just dealing with VW dealers in various cities (Spokane, Eugene, Tucson, Bozeman--Spokane being the worst of the lot, and I bought my car there!): in most cases the mechanics are the folks to deal with, as very few of them have ever not been forthcoming with me.  But the dealer folks, in my experience, have been uniformly rotten, prevaricating, nimrods.  Just bad people.

So, I still have my car because I love driving it, and as long as it doesn't cost me an arm and a leg to keep running I imagine I'll keep it for some time.  But this is not a joyride free of headaches, and if you're considering the New Jetta, go into the arrangement knowing it will not be the same sort of experience you might have owning a Honda or a Toyota.  But then those cars offer very different driving experiences than VWs do.  Therein lies the tossup.  I love my Jetta warts and all, but I will not buy another VW.

<b>Update [16 Oct 03]:</b> The day before I was to go to the dealer to have my front struts and serpentine belt replaced as well as some switch mechanism controlling the courtesy light on my door, my front passenger's window crashed into the sill AGAIN!  I called the dealer to add this repair to my LIST of needed repairs.  The next day, my car would not even start.  I had to call the dealer to arrange for a new service appointment and had to bike to work (again).  I had to arrange for a tow truck to take my car to the dealer (and I had to take off of work to deal with all this).  The Bozeman service people were all very nice about this stuff (I guess they ought to be), and they had my car ready the next day, which was a nice surprise, but the switch issue went unfixed, and the service guy said he didn't know what I was talking about because they had no record of such a repair being necessary (even though I had dealt with them in person and on the phone about that very repair).  Now, I drive my car to work and nowhere else.  I can't really afford more problems with it and am getting rid of it in January, at which time I plan to buy a Nissan.

Update [26 July 03]: The paint on my car is not what I'd call long-lasting, and minor parking lot dings become humongous body shop expenses (no other car I've owned has been like this).  After driving through high winds outside of Los Angeles, I had so many nicks to my front bumper and hood that I had to spend over 500 dollars for a hood repaint.  Too, the clear-lens headlights have become so scuffed from regular driving that they will need to be replaced.  Worst of all: I just got back from a roadtrip to Eugene, OR and Moses Lake, WA (I live in Bozeman, MT).  Before leaving, I had the Bozeman dealer check the car over; my work order even says "owner going on long road trip."  The Bozeman dealer said everything was fine, even when I specifically remarked on worries about wobbly-feeling driving in the front end (this I had them check out on two separate occasions--both times they said it was nothing beyond maybe a slight need for wheel alignment or tire inflation).  As I drove to Eugene my "check engine" light came on.  Great.  Luckily, the Eugene dealer squeezed me in that next day and said I needed a new air filter and some related parts--250 bucks, sheesh.  THEN, the Eugene folks told me my front struts were nearly shot, and I needed a new serpentine belt.  I asked if the strut wear might have contributed to that wobbly feeling I was noticing, and they said absolutely.  They said I could drive home okay, though.  Then I headed to Moses Lake, WA to help a friend move in.  As I parked my car and cracked my driver's side window for some air, it crashed into the door frame (any Jetta owner knows what this means).  Yes, in the middle of nowhere, the window apparatus broke.  VW STILL has not recalled this crap (however, right after I first posted this review, VW America sent me a letter saying they'd cover future window-crashings up to 70K miles).  With no dealer around, I reluctantly called Spokane, where I bought the car.  They said the service bay was busy and would have to call me back, which they did not do (of course).  I called them back and was told I couldn't get in for a fix until 8 days later.  The guy on the phone added, "I know it sucks to have an open window for that long.  Just hope it doesn't rain."  Direct quote.  I called the Bozeman dealer . . . and was told exactly the same thing: I had to wait 8 days.  I said okay.  So I drove 8 hours home to Bozeman with the darned window all the way down--in 100-degree heat and through forest fires!--(I'm deaf from the wind noise) and have taped a garbage bag over my window (lovely) and thrown my car cover over the whole miserable affair just waiting to get to the Bozeman dealer Tuesday morning. 
 
Do I sound bitter?  

My entire family is telling me to unload this car, and I think I must finally concede that, no matter how good I think it looks nor how fun it is to drive, this new car has been worse than ANY used one I've ever had.  When I see other Jetta drivers I want to give them hugs or at least sympathetic nods in acknowledgment of how we are similarly afflicted.

And this makes me really upset with VW as a company because I think they could really have some great cars to sell if they would just resolve their electrical problems and dealer social skills.  But from everything I've heard, these problems have been VW hallmarks for years, and they don't seem at all interested in changing.

I so wanted this car.  And I had a lot of fun with it sometimes.  I thought the Jetta would be sensible!  Boy, am I a sucker.  It's a pinata full of headaches, and the dealers are rotten (except for Eugene--they always told me like it was; good people there).
Rats.
