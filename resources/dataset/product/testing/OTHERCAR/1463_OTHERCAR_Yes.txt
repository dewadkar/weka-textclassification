            Having bought this car new in 1996, I've had it now for 6 years and 90,000 miles.  I would imagine most people reading these reviews are looking to purchase one of these cars used, so this review will be focused towards used car issues.  While I can't speak for all of the Saturns, this particular one has been extremely reliable when I lived in rural (all highway driving) and urban (mostly city driving).  Aside from wear items (like brakes - and be sure to ask your mechanic if you need new brake pads when you have the tires rotated, I have never heard my brakes squeal which usually tells me to replace them) the only repair on the vehicle has been $150 to replace the cam cover gasket (done about 60,000 miles).  My car also uses oil, like the reviewer before me, though I can't tell where it's going - there are no leaks and no "smoky" exhaust which usually tells of a car burning oil.  Anyway, the oil consumption is about 1 quart every 3,000 miles, which Saturn says is typical, so I leave it alone.

The biggest drawback to the car is it's small backseat.  If you've seen it you can tell no adult can fit back there.  Perhaps kids can sit back there, I've never tried.  I just push my seats all the way back and use the backseat as more cargo room.

All in all, the car has been a great performer and probably will perform well for most people.  I plan on keeping this car until the cost of repairs equal the cost of a car payment (car has long since been paid off) and expect I'll have it a long time.  It is also the second Saturn I've owned, the first  a 4dr 1992 SL2, is being driven by my step-brother, now with 120,000 miles and one $400 repair to the air conditioning.
