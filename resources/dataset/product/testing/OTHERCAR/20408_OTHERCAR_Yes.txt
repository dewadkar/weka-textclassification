            Ok, I've wanted one of these for years. I was about to buy one back in 1998, but then I heard of the new model, and since 1998 was becoming a bad year for jettas, I waited. 

I picked up a 2000 GLX a couple months ago. If I was able to rate the dealership as well as the car, i would give the dealership 1/2 star. at the most. They lie, they are rude, and they don't care. The jetta is such a hot car right now that the dealerships are hiring the worst of them. So, prepare for that if you plan on buying one...Even worse for the buying experience is that I insisted on a black jetta GLX with black leather. Since they knew that, they were able to work me even more, since they can be hard to get around here (sillycon valley).

Now for the car: I love it! The acceleration is amazing. I wanted a 5-speed, and got one. The GLX's interior is something else. Much different than my first car--a '78 rabbit. It's more like an Audi.

The car drives very smoothly. Funny thing, this car is so fast that on my first day of ownership, i took it for a nice mountain drive. A guy at the rest stop asked me if I want to purchase a component that disengages the 130mph speed limiter. Think I'll wait to see if i ever need to go faster than 130mph first...

I recommend the VR6 or the new turbo4 when choosing an engine. The base engine is pretty weak, and I learned from my last car that the saved money up front leads to more expensive repairs later on from an overworked engine. 

The GLX has some bells and whistles that have spoiled me. Heated seats are great on the back-- can't wait to try them during snowboarding season. Climate control is excellent, I don't have to continually screw with the heat control. 

An incredible amount of thought went into the design of this car. After 2 months, i am still noticing little features that I would have never thought of, but now cannot live without. For instance, when I put the car in reverse, the passenger-side mirror tilts down and out so i have a better view. The oh-shit handles have a very smooth, ergonomic action (you have to pull one down to understand what i mean). The rear-view mirror automatically tints when someone's headlights are shining right into it. However, I opted for the extended warranty due to the fact that this all means that more things are likely to break over the years.

Now, on to those damn rear seats that we keep reading and hearing about:

It's true, there's no room back there. none at all. Why they installed a third headrest and seatbelt...must have been some cheezy marketing tactic. If you have a family or you drive people around all the time, go with a passat.
                          ~HOWEVER~
There is MORE room up front than most cars of it's size. I am 6' 7&quot; so I know that for a fact. A big reason why I wanted the jetta is because I fit in the jetta. Accords, camrys, etc-- those guys made the new cars huge but didn't allow for those front seats to go back any further. The jetta is the only car of it's size where my legs fit _under_ the steering wheel. so there.

So far, the only things i wish for is a firmer suspension when cornering, and an enhancement to the rain-sensing windshield wipers.. It holds the road well, but sways a little too much. For the engine power, they should have made it a little firmer. This ain't no cadillac... 

The wipers don't work too well during a light drizzle. They sense when rain hits the windshield. But it appears the rain has to hit on special areas, otherwise they won't turn on. It would be nice if they programmed the wipers to go every 15-20 seconds anyway when in intermittent mode.

Oh yeah, the sunroof is a little noisy when shut.

This not your father's jetta. Or even your older sibling's. This thing's brand new, and in a class of it's own. Not all are into the euro-style, with the firm seats, clean lines, well-laid out instrumentation and timeless design, but for those who are, and you can't quite afford that Audi A6 quattro, this one's perfect.  



******** 4 months later *********

ok, i'm back on here to tell you how the car is running with 8000 miles. The dealership took a month to get me in for service. That was a kind of a pain in the ass. A few things broke, just little things: the rear cupholder, and i blew out a woofer. rockin out too hard, i guess. They fixed them no problem. Other than that, it's running great.
