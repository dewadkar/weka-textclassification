            I researched digital cameras on line extensively.  I found that this little camera does a great job and it is so easy to use.  The actual software is a little hard to get used to but since I have it is smooth sailing.  The only thing about digital cameras that I did not know was how long it takes for them to take a picture.  I am used to a 35mm and they are very quick, this takes some time and you have to stay steady while you are doing it.<br><br>
