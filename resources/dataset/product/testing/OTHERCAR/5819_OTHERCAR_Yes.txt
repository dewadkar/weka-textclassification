            This is written for the Olympus D-510 here due to the fact that there is no place yet to write about this camera.  If you are considering buying a D-490 (as I was) you now have something else to think about.  Olympus has listened to the complaints that were given on the 490 and fixed them.  

I have been looking for a digital camera for a long time and was sure I was going to buy the D-490.  It had most everything I wanted but it was still lacking a few items which caused me to wait.  Here's what I thought and many others (if you read their reviews) thought lacked in the 490.  1. NO USB 2. The flash didn't pop up by itself 3. Battery life.

Those problems have all been addressed.  The 510 has USB support and it works great.  THe flash now pops up on its own (although you have to put it down manually).  Battery life, well that is always the sticking point with some people.  I went out and got NIHM batteries because I knew I would need them so I got 8 (4 for spares). While I waited for the first 4 to charge (I got the cheap charger because I have the time not the money), I popped in the 4 included AA.  These are the cheap I don't expect them to last kind of AA bateries.  Well, I have been shooting in HQ (medium quality) mode for two days well over 50 pictures and they are still going strong.  The NIHM will last even longer.  For a point of reference most people using standard AA run out of power after 20-30 shots. Nihm will last depending on the quality of shot 300 pictures.  

The USB rocks.  I can download a 32 mb disk in less than 10 seconds probably less than 5 but I don't really look at the watch to see how long it takes, But its fast.

Why did I get this camera as opposed to others.  Well I wanted a 2.1 mp camera with an Optical zoom (forget Digital your computer can do that for you).  Second, I wanted smart media.  I know CF has more storage but being in the military I travel alot and I want to be able to use the floppy adapter (sold sep.) in any computer I come across.  What good it the photo if you can't get it out of the camera?  If it weren't for that sure CF would do great I don't use the adapter at my house anyway...Why  USB!  I wanted a USB and the 490 didn't have it and so I waited for the new version ans yes it has it. 
 
I also wanted a video out.  This really isn't that important to some but when I go to the grandparents who don't have a computer I can just plug it into the tv and show them the pics that way.  Also you can attach it to your own VCR add music and make your own video copy without having to have a super computer (or the brains to figure it out).
How easy is this camera to use? In a word, easy.  I did read the manual (which I will admit to only because I haven't used alot of digital cameras and they all are a little different).  Anyway back to ease of use.  I went to an air show today and got the opportunity to sit in a B-25 (the planes Dolittle and his men flew).  One of the owners of the plane asked if I wanted my picture taken so I handed him the camera and I heard, "this is one of those digital cameras".  I thought, great these picture might not be coming out.  I told him press half way to focus then all the way to take the shot.  Result, a perfect shot.

I can't be happier with this product.  Although I still have a few suggestions if you are thinking about buying one. You must get rechargable batteries.  You also need to get a larger memory card.  8 mb is far to small.  Read the manual.  Guys, just go in another room so no one sees you doing this.  Other than that your mom could take great pictures with this camera.  I bought mine at Circuit City for $399.  Again I'm sorry this isn't in the correct category I will move it as soon as they get one for this camera.
