            I have come a long way with this camera, and once you learn about it, it really is a great little piece of equipment. 

I had been using a largan digital camera, which has no LCD screen, talk about taking a guess in the dark while taking pictures. Naturally when I saw this one for $95 I jumped on it. The store was including an extra 16mb chip with every purchase.  

I was able to figure out (for the most part) how to use this camera without reading the manual (which I like!), and the manual was easy enough to navigate what I needed to find very quickly!

I used my camera for the 1st time at a party & the Nickel metal hydride battery it came with died almost instantly. I used to rechargables it came with, and they died within a few hours also. I just figured I didn't charge them long enough. 

When I got home I could not figure out for the life of me how to work their software so I could get the pictures off my camera. I spent hours searching the net & found nothing. Finally I came across a site & basically what you need to do is hook up the camera & your PC will see it as a removable drive. So really, I'm not sure what the software is for!

When I looked at my pictures I laughed so hard, the quality is very good & they print out quite nicely, but I learned quickly that the red-eye flash NEEDS to be used. All the people I took pictures of had either very red eyes, or no eye balls, just white holes in their heads! I spent about 2 hours putting dark circles where their eyeballs should have been! It was hysterical. 

The flash is very bright & travels a long distance, you can take a picture pretty far & be able to see your object! The down side of the bright flash is that I noticed when I use the flash it actually reflects off any dust particles that are airborne. At first I thought my lens was dirty, but started taking pictures by holding the camera way up high, I could see the flash reflect off the dust.

Overall, this camera is a great buy, I have come to love it after learning about it & I wouldn't trade it for anything. . . At least not right now!
