            We purchased this car with 61K on it from the original owner (a business owner in his seventies, no hot-rodder type).  We did not mind that some trim was a bit loose since that is easy enough to fix.

The problems began after a couple of months.  The radiator has begun to leak on the right end tank (no evidence of damage or stop-leak used), the rear driver side ashtray popped up and cannot be latched back down (non-smoker car), the exhaust self-disconnected where the air pump supplies air to the cats,  a front A/C air vent housing fell out and cracked up as if it had been in the sun for a century or so, the MAP sensor has failed and the fuel pressure regulator fails to operate properly, rendering a decrease in fuel mileage from 18 in the city to about 13.  Lastly, the passenger A/C controls have failed as well.

In all fairness the car does have a relatively smooth ride and decent braking.  The roominess of the interior stands out.  If nothing else the trunk provides ample room for the repair parts that the car requires on what is swiftly becoming a regular basis.

I bought this car for my Mom with the intention of it being her best one ever, since it is probably the last one she will have.  As it stands now I may change that outcome to reflect a trade up to a more reliable, and therefore more safe, car.  Time to give Lincoln a try....
