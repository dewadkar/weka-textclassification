            If you are looking for a dependable, well built for the money, off-road machine, YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE A WRANGLER.  I bought my jeep wrangler in November of '98.  I had it specially ordered with air and a hard top.  I wanted a four-wheel drive that was inexpensive and I wanted a convertible. 
Although the hard top isn't all that practical for the person who doesn't want to fool with getting a little wet when on the road, it is a great investment.  After I got my jeep I bought a soft top with the full soft doors.  They aren't all that great for noise resistance and you can't lock them but they are very durable and are a reminder of what people had to go thru in the early days of the jeep.  

I have always wanted a jeep and I guess that is why I give it such great vibes.  I don't want you to take my word for it though, I would like for you to test it out.  I am telling you from experience.  I have been living in the mountains for 21 years.  I have been off roading for approx. 10 years.  I have been driving four wheel drives for about 6 years.  I can tell you that there is nothing like a jeep for the money to impress someone.  I have never been so happy over a vehicle.  I am usually the type of person who gets something, and later wishes having something else.  I am totally not like that with my jeep.<br><br>
