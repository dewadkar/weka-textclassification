            I got my 1995 Geo Prizm as a senior in college.  It was (and still is) my first car.  It has been an excellent choice.  It gets good gas mileage, fits five good friends in it (or four with luggage and creative packing), has low maintenance costs and few problems, didn�t cost too much, and is safer than a sub-compact.  I intend to drive my car right into the ground (we�re shooting for well over a hundred thousand miles together).

<b>A bit of info on the Prizm</b>

The Geo Prizm (now the Chevy Prizm) is actually the same car as the Toyota Corolla � same frame and engine and everything.  They two cars differ only on minor details like taillight design.  The Corolla is a great car, and with the Prizm you can basically get the Corolla for about $2,000 less!


Here is what I think of my car, on different points (in no particular order):

<b>Maintenance</b>

I have had no serious problems with my Prizm in its 40,000 miles.  The routine maintenance costs very little � about $25 for each 3,000-mile service.  Even the routine services are less than the Corolla at the same dealer!

I�ve had a few minor problems with the car:

*  In very hot weather the plastic gearshift cover rotates on the gearshift pole, which can be startling when you grab it for the first time!
*  The foam weather stripping on the back windows sometimes sticks to the glass.
*  The security system we got for the car failed after a couple years (it failed the day after I paid off the car, actually).  I was able to start the car by popping the clutch and driving it to a mechanic who removed the whole system for $30, and informed me that the system was a piece of cr*p anyway and he could have fooled it with a paper clip.  Note that this isn�t Geo�s fault!  The dealer put that system in.

<b>Gas Mileage</b>

Under the best conditions � freeway driving, windows closed, no AC � I get about 34 miles per gallon.  Under less good conditions � city driving, AC, loaded car � I get about 32 miles per gallon.  This is pretty good and I�m happy with it.  

Honestly, I need the car to move me and a little luggage around on lots of freeways.  I don�t need a big gas-guzzling SUV to haul me, a big cage of pet rats, some laundry, and a suitcase around.

<b>Safety</b>

The Prizm has dual airbags.  By nature, it is a small sedan and therefore safer than the sub-compacts out there like the Metro and the Honda Civic.  The backseats have shoulder straps.

<b>Power</b>

Okay, this car isn�t gifted with a lot of power, but it gets me where I need to go.  I need to switch down into fourth gear to get up some hills (okay, third gear for steep hills).

A funny story � one summer I had a job that took me through some steep mountain roads.  My car would really struggle over this one really steep hill (queue 'Indiana Jones Theme').  When I was forced to shift into fourth gear one of my passengers would shout, 'Ah, Prizms!  Go, little hamsters, go!'

That pretty much sums up the power of this car :)

<b>Cost</b>

The cost is quite reasonable.  I paid about $10,000 for mine.  A tip � I bought the car new, in 1996.  It was a 1995 model and had been sitting in the lot for a year.  The new 1996 models had come in and the dealer was desperate to get rid of this old model.  Good position to be in!  He didn�t haggle much.

<b>Ride</b>

Good � a little noisy, though.  I�ve taken this car on all sorts of roads under all sorts of conditions (except for snow and ice) and it has done quite well.  I�ve taken it on twisty mountain roads, steep San Francisco city driving (in a standard transmission, no less!  White knuckles, anyone?), dirt backroads with deep ruts and rocks hitting the undercarriage, regular city driving, and lots of freeway driving.  It has gone on some pretty bad roads and has held up well.  It�s no SUV, but honestly, how many SUV drivers take their precious babies on back roads, anyway?

<b>Space</b>

The Prizm has a surprising amount of space for such a small car.  The back seat does not fold forward (alas!  I�ve had to resort to driving around with large poles sticking out of the front passenger window when necessary), but there is good trunk space if you are creative.

The best I�ve done is to pack four people and four sets of weekend camping gear into my car.  We were tight in the end � the freshly painted T-shirts were on the back dash, the pinecones under the passenger seat � but we all made it home safely.

<b>Looks</b>

The Prizm is a pretty standard 4-door sedan, not particularly remarkable.  Inside is nice, but not as nice as a Honda Accord (no fuzzy plush seats, nor the &quot;thwoomp&quot; of a hermetic seal as you slam the door).

<b>Accessories</b>

I almost have the strip model: no power windows, no power locks, and no trunk-popping button.  Always gives my nieces a thrill when I tell them to <i>manually</i> lock their doors and close their windows.  I do have AC and a radio, but no tape deck.  The AC works pretty well.  If you get into the car on a hot summer day and its 120 degrees inside the car, it takes about five minutes to cool it down.  The tape deck is unremarkable, which may be the best option considering theft.  I do lust after a five CD changer in the trunk, though :)

My only gripe: I have a standard transmission and I have no tachometer!  Argh!  I see the tachometer on more expensive cars with automatic transmission and I seethe.  I need one!


<b>CONCLUSION</b>

The Prizm is a good, plucky little car.  It is not sporty or sexy, and it is unremarkable to look at.  But, it gets me where I need to go, gets good gas mileage, has a decent amount of space, has a great maintenance record, and didn�t cost that much.  I feel I got a great deal.  So, if you are looking for a little car to get you places with no fuss, at low cost, look into the Prizm!
