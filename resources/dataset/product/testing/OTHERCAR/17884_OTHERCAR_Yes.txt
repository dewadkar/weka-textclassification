            We own two Blazers, a 1989 two door two wheel drive Tahoe, with the 4.3 V6, and a 1997 four door, two wheel drive. Both were purchased new, and we love every bit of Chevy parts on each one. The older one, has been if not the best car we ever had, maybe the second best. It never had to be taken to the shop, other than scheduled maintenance visits, what a great vehicle. I love it, it sure has some minor problems that really shouldn't be called problems, but there they are, things like poor mileage and a rough ride. Well, these are not perfect cars, other than that, nothing to lose your sleep. 
 Now, the '97, a deep red four door two wheel drive, besides being a little less reliable than the older one, it's very strong, and, not so comfortable as a Cadillac, but it is very good indeed. This one spends a lot of gas, and has had some visits to the dealer, regarding battery failure, and one time the rear sway bar fell off from one side, due to a broken bushing, also, the air conditioning unit, has given us some headaches. But, even though these, which I call minor defects, won't make us change our minds, about these trucks in general.
 We bought the '97  after having such a great experience with the first one.  We still own both of them, and are not planning to get rid of neither one. As a matter of fact, I am in the process of rebuilding the '89 completely. When the time comes, we might get a third Blazer, if possible, who knows?  Like I said before, I love them.<br><br>
