             Hey everyone!
I have to stop in and let you know what it's like to own the new Monte Carlo 2000!

  We have had ours for roughly 2 weeks now and I have to say that I am impressed.  I know many may read this and feel that we haven't had it long enough to really know it, but I'm here to share what I do know for anyone who has been thinking of purchasing one.

  I have to admit that when we were discussing the purchase of a new car, a Monte Carlo was not on the top of my list.  I personally did not care for alot of the &quot; past styles &quot; of the vehicle itself.  My other half and I were on the hunt for a vehicle that was felt solid, looked good, and handled well.  This car never came to mind with me.  The only time I had seen it was briefly during the commercial featuring my close buddy, &quot;TAZ&quot;.
I paid more attention to Taz than the car. hehe

  I turned over the decision to my other half, ( because I had to work ) and when he came to pick me up, low and behold, I saw this brand new, sleek, black car shining bright!  I had to take 3 looks before I realized it was him and our new Monte Carlo.  When I sat down in it, I still had to ask him what it was because I truly did not recognize it.

  The ride in the vehicle is very smooth and very quiet.  The downside is that if you don't pay attention to the speedometer, you may catch yourself speeding on the freeway without even knowing it. You could be doing 75 and it feels like 50.

  This car has all the toys and comfort that we love in a vehicle.  We chose fabric seats, (due to the fact of sticking to leather in the summer)
hehe.  

  Our Monte Carlo happens to be black with the all black interior.  Living where we live, there is alot of change in the weather. Yes the car is very hot on hot days, but I have to tell you the A/C system is great and cools the car down fast.  The same goes for the heat on cold days.  

  Leg room is a big part of the Monte Carlo as well.  I do not like to have my knees anywhere near a dash and this one gives you plenty of space in both the front and rear.

  The stereo comes with a cd player and tapedeck, which is really nice to have instead of plugging in a portable. One of my favorite features of the 2000 is the fact that if you opt to, you do not have to take your eyes off the road in order to adjust your volume control for the stereo and no, the volume control is not on the steering wheel.  It has an auto adjust that will adjust your volume to the speed you are travelling. If you have it set to a certain hearing level, and you are driving in the city and get onto a highway, well we know once you kick the windows down a little, it gets hard to hear. The 2000 has taken that problem away and leaves you more time to keep your eyes on the rd.  It will also bring the volume down as you bring your speed down.

  The 2000 drives very smooth and very quiet and feels like a solid car. I love that. I need to feel safe and solid in a vehicle.  The 2000 has definitely changed my mind about the look and feel of a Monte!

  The only drawback for us is that our warranty only covers it up to 15000 miles, and let's just say, we drive alot!  :-)

  Personally, we are, so far, very satisfied with this vehicle.  Now of course, if anything goes wrong, I will definitely be back to update you on that, but as for now, in my opinion only,  I am very happy with it.

  If you can't buy it, make a salesman happy and take it for a test drive. 
It is worth it.  

  Enjoy everyone!!!!!!<br><br>
