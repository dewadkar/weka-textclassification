               I was lucky enough to recieve a hefty chunk of change as a signing bonus from my new job, and decided to treat myself to something I've always wanted- a convertible. I didn't want just any car with the top lopped off, however; I wanted something that would fit in amid the BMWs, Mercedes' and Jags parked at the firm's garage. That so, I tested every convertible in the $30-$50K price range. With my heart set on the Covette (too expensive for a 24-year old to insure!), my eyes fixed on the Z3 (I can't deal with a plastic rear window in the Midatlantic- I'd hate the car by mid-November), and my penchant for status steering me towards the Mercedes SLK-320 (a two-seater for the next three years...would I still want that by NEXT year?), the Saab never really figured into my plans.
   Then I saw one of these on the road. My head turned as this elegant, "old-money" house frau sped by me, leaving me in her dust. "What was that?" I remarked to my passenger. "The Saab 9-3" he answered. The next day I tested the Saab.  By this point, I was less awed by the lush leather interior, beautiful wood appointments and easy operation of the power top. I was, however, impressed by the intelligent array of features on the car (an in-dash panel that calculates your estimated arrival time based on your imput of miles to your destination; a warning signal if you go above a speed pre-set by you, external themometer, a fuel guage that tells you the distance you can travel until empty, your average fuel consumption, and your average speed). 
    To all of this, add one free year of On-Star, where you are cheefully greeted by name and helped with things as mundane as directions (you don't need to know where you are, or even exactly where you are going- they know) or as sublime as restaurant reservations and movie times. Moreover, as a young woman, it gives me peace of mind to know that no matter where I am, or when, I never need to exit my car to summon assistance or get information. This is invaluable.
    While I am not a car-expert, I do love to drive, and the Saab provides plenty of power. I ultimately purchased the SE, with 205-HP ( I would have gone with the Viggen, but do not like manual transmission driving, given the frequency with which I am stuck in traffic). The car accelerates smoothly and quickly, and in the "Sport" mode (activated by the push of a button on the gear box) has blown away Porsches and 'Vettes alike thus far. The only danger is that one should not drive so fast when the steering is so sensitive. A sneeze nearly sent me into a highway divider, and the car is almost "too" responsive. Thankfully, the brakes are even more responsive.
    The only "problem" I've had thus far is that the wheel shakes excessively on anything other than perfectly smooth, freshly paved road. I took my car back to the dealership to have this remedied, and the service manager tried to convince me that this was normal for a convertible. It was only after much insistance that the problem was ultimately fixed (I still don't know what the problem was- his answer was evasive, but so long as it was OK, I didn't much care). The wheel does still vibrate some, probably more than ought to be acceptible in a car of this price, but it has not yet proven to be a nuisance, as it is now limited to speeds over 75MPH (a speed at which I rarely have opportunity to travel).
    I chose this car over the German RWD alternatives largely for that reason- I am confident the Saab will be able to handle the inevitable snow, and it also is great fun when the skies are clear and the air warm. It is also a superior choice for an "every day" car because there is trunk space and seating for 4 (unless your rear passengers are over 5'6" or so). Also, only Volvo and Saab pride themselves on the safety of their convertibles (BMW glossed over the subject at 3 dealerships!), which ought to be of concern to everyone- after all, who cares how good your car looks, if your face and body are mangled? Saabs feature a whip-lash protective head rest and a wealth of other features to protect the passenger at the expense of the vehicle.
    Audiophiles take note: the stock stereo is really quite good, and pleased both my inexpert ears and those of a musician friend who is critical of anything that makes noise. Also, the radio and CD controls are right on the wheel, making it easy to change trancks while changing lanes. Moreover, the car senses increases in speed and increases volume on its own to compete with road noise. It lowers the vloume as the car slows down.
    As for noise, I have found the Saab to be noisier than the Mercedes (as a part-time hardtop), but otherwise pleasantly quiet inside the cabin. The air conditioner is a little noisy, but, in its defense, it was had to work hard the last few days to keep the cabin at 72 degrees (it has automatic climate control- so set your favorite temperature, and let the car figure out how to get it there).
    The seats are incredibly comfortable- a little like a firm mattress that conforms and molds to the shape of your body while supporting your back and legs. The 8-ways automatic seats make finding the perfect position a snap, and the memory seats for 3 drivers is a pleasant addition for those who have to share the car- not that you'd want to.
    I love this car, and feel it was a good choice for me. It was something of a "compromise" for me, in that is was not my first love, but the car offers so much, that it is really hard to resist.
