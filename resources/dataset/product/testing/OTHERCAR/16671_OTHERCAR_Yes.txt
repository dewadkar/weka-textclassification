            To be truthful, I didn't want to buy a new car this year, but after 4 months and $1,000 in repairs on my old one, and it STILL didn't run right, it was time to move on.  I had decided I wanted an all wheel drive car, because of the snow and ice in the winter.  It really handles well in the snow - nothing will let you zip along at 55 when the roads are bad, but it's nice to be able to travel at 30-40 mph and not feel like you're taking your life in your hands.  It holds the road well - much better than my old vehicle.  I love all the room in the back (It's the station wagon) - it holds more than my old van.  The split back seat is nice if you need more room but still need to seat three people.  There a 5 people in my family, which means we can all fit into the car, but I don't know how that would be if we were on a long trip.  Anybody who wants a nice driving car should consider the 2001 Subaru Legacy L station wagon.  <br><br>
