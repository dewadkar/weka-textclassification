            <b>The Sentra GXE:</b> That other sedan
We bought our 1998 Nissan Sentra brand spanking new with only 32 miles on it when we drove home. Although the Nissan is on the lower side of high quality compact cars, the Sentra seems to be totally redesigned. With sleek lines, nice curves (the car not me) and lots of room inside, you can�t go wrong with a Sentra.

<b>The Price:</b>
 Well brand new it was about $13,000 but then we added options and financing. 

<b>The Exterior:</b>
 With a sleek wide body you cam imagine taking turns at a high speed in this car will be no problem. Small tires give the Sentra a very low ground clearance. Rear spoiler is optional but can add immensely to the look overall. A wide back end (once again the car not me) helps keeps the Sentra look proportioned. Plastic bumpers seem to be the rage now, and the Sentra offers a huge plastic bumper.

<b>The Interior:</b>
 Large comfortable seats make long rides almost bearable in the Sentra. Two airbags offer extra safety to this little sedan. Large dash fixtures make it easy for the (occasional) speedometer reading. Large spacious back seats easily sit 3 adults or 3 car seats.  Optional power windows/locks make the back windows safe for children. (Easily locked from the driver door.) 
 The Sentra make look small from the outside but it has tons of space inside to keep up to 5 adults seated comfortably. 

<b>What I would change:</b>
 The low ground clearance. Personally I prefer a car higher off the ground. And I would get more lumbar controls for the driver and passenger seats. 

<b>What I would not change:</b>
 The price is great for a sporty little sedan. The room inside the Sentra is quite amazing. And the overall look to the Sentra GXE is very classic. I wouldn�t change much that is for sure.

<b>The Ride:</b>
 You won�t notice most small bumps in the road. Easily stuck in soft sand due to the ground clearance. Long trips are not a problem for your bottom or back. 

I would <i>definitely</i> recommend the Sentra to a friend looking for a 2nd car. Or even a car for a first time driver. With all the safety features in the Sentra, you will have peace of mind with your loved ones riding inside.

Happy Driving!
