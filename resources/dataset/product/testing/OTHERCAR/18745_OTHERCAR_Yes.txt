            I love my acura legend it is very very scary fast. My legend
handles corners like a champ with no body roll. The Bose system 
has absolutely the best sound,quality and comfort because of it,s
steering wheel volume control keep your eyes on the road it has
so many other features. The Acura 8 seat position controls are tops. accented with butter soft leather seats,heated mirrors,heated seats,
A.B.S breaking.speaking on the cons about the car the only thing i dislike about the car is ABS breaking system it sucks not just on my car but all cars thats just this mans opinion... <br><br>
