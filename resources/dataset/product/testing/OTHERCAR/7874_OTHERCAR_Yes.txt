            My parents bought a used 1997 Toyota Avalon XL during the summer of 2000, and I've driven it a lot in the last three months. We were drawn to this car because of its large back seats (my friends and I are pretty tall and it's convenient to have the comfortable transportation for 5 people. We've also owned other Toyotas and they have always been rock solid in reliability. I'll break down the rest of the points into categories:
(out of 5 points)

Styling: Some people have mistook the car as a Lexus at first sight, but to be blunt it's a rather boring looking car. Nothing offensive though so I'll give it 4 points.

Engine: A little slow at start (this might be different for people at sea level though, I live at 7000 feet), but once the car gets going it is quite powerful (200 horsepower). It has plenty of passing power for the highway, and feels reasonable secure at high speeds. The engine also gets 4 points for its slightly sluggish low end acceleration.

Comfort: I wanted leather seating, but the only suitable used Avalon we could find was cloth. The seating is not very firm, but still comfortable for medium length trips. The cabin is usually very quiet, but I hear a bit of wind noise at speed. However, this may be a result of the aftermarket sunroof that the previous owners installed. The front seats are quite spacious, and the rear seats are huge compared to the other cars we considered (Camry, Accord etc.) The stereo system is ok, nothing to rock the block with but enough to listen to music at a medium volume without distortion. The comfort score is 4 points because of the wind noise.

Reliability: While we've only had the car for about three months, we recently had to replace the power steering gears for an unknown reason. The dealership was very pleasant though, and as the car was still under warranty I have no huge gripes about it. The mechanic said this was a fairly uncommon problem, so you probably wouldn't have to worry about it. again the car scores 4 points, as other than this breakdown it has performed flawlessly.

Summary: The Avalon is a extremely competent car, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a value oriented medium/large car with lots of back seat room and a pretty nice engine. The car also does not elicit the snide comments that some of my friends more expensive cars do even though it is about as comfortable. If interior space is your main criteria then I definitely recommend that you take a look at this fine automobile.
