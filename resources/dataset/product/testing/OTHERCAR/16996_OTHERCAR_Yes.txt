            Ever since the SUV craze hit in the early 90�s there has been a constant move toward the upscale market.  Today we have seen the emergence of four major players in the $40K pseudo-SUV market, they are vehicles from traditional luxury marques and all posses 3 main traits. All-Wheel-Drive, peppy 6-cylinder engines in base form, and all the goodies offered on the luxury sedans that share their brand name.  These vehicles are the Acura MDX, the Mercedes M-class, the BMW X5, and the Lexus RX300.

The Lexus is really spotted below the others in size and carries a much more minivan feel to it compared to the others.  The MDX is brand-spanking-new from Acura and is only the second all-Honda SUV (CR-V was first).  The Acura has entered a very competitive market at a time that SUV sales are declining and gas prices are soaring, and has a difficult field ahead of it.  However I believe that it will succeed for a few simple reasons.  Utility, Aesthetics, and Price.

The first thing that the MDX does for its driver is offer a variety of tasks that can be easily carried out and that do not tax the vehicles abilities.  It has more power than most other 6-cylinder models, and is much more capable off-road than either a Mercedes ML320 or a BMW X5 3.0i, due mostly to a difference in ground clearance and available suspension travel.  From a cargo standpoint, it offers a generous interior volume beyond that of either the BMW or the Mercedes, although the official figures do not reflect this due to the third row seat of the MDX.  On the road the MDX offers a highly refined ride and handling that is very pleasant with no �truck-like� motions to throw you off balance.  Those road manners are not as prodigious as those of the X5, but the 7-passenger seating and the more gutsy off-road abilities offset this difference handily.  The M-class possesses similar on-road characteristics, but does so with the burden of body-on-frame construction that greatly limits its performance compared with the unibody construction of its peers.  In retrospect the MDX can be described as the spiritual opposite of the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The Jeep possesses capabilities well beyond any of its competitors, and adds refinement and luxury until the desired package result is achieved; meanwhile the MDX has taken luxury and refinement, and added greater utility and ruggedness.

With regards to the aesthetic, the MDX is a Home Run.  Its interior embraces the painful ease-of-use we have come to expect from anything wearing an A or H on the hood. (Hence the brilliance of Hyundai�name sounds like �Honda,� badge looks like Honda�but I won�t get started on that).  Typical Acura luxury (it�s not �traditional luxury� like the M-B and BMW because 1986 wasn�t long enough ago to allow the use of �traditional�) abounds inside as well with a very nice 7-speaker stereo standard and a host of other little brilliances typical of the maker�s products.  From a styling viewpoint, the MDX succeeds both inside and out offering tame but �new� looks that please the eye but will not become eyesores in the future.

The last piece to the puzzle is value.  The MDX outpaced its competitors in many areas, mostly the available equipment, and the price of it, you cannot pay more than $40K for one of these, where a loaded up BMW or M-B is easily into the $40Ks.  The only thing that the MDX gives up to the others is a V-8 option.  Something we may see corrected with the advent of the 3.5RL�s replacement.  It also should not go unsaid that the MDX gets better fuel economy than either of the Germans, although they all drink premium.  Acuras are also much easier on the checkbook to get replacement parts for.

In the end, the Acura will out-sell its competition because it does more things better for less money and does not sacrifice any luxury to its price-peers.  And with a slowing economy, the price difference may be the difference.

Regarding the Acura DVD based navigation system....it rules.  It is easy to use, very intuitive and very quick.  It also exists in a very pleasing dash display.
