            We have had our 1999 Nissan Quest SE for 15 months now, and this is by far the BEST Vehicle we have ever owned! We LOVE the TV/VCR combo package for our boys, the dual sliding doors, the CD player, the dual AC controls...We have the sun/moon roof and the 2 rows of captains chairs-going on a vacation in this Van is awesome, I almost feel like I'm cheating because we're so comfortable! This Van handles like a sedan, and it has the oomf it needs if you have to accelerate quickly. We researched every Mini-Van on the market-and the Quest was the *NICEST* Van in the bunch! If you have kids-then this Van is for you!!<br><br>
