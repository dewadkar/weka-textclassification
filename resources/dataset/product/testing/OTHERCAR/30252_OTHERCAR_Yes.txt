            First things first... if you're looking for a digital camera to replace your traditional 35 mm, this is not the camera for you.  However, if you're looking for a simple camera to quickly capture an image or two to attach to an email or use in an online auction, this may do the trick.

While the image quality isn't particularly good and transferring pictures to your PC can be a bit quirky, the camera does work decently.  It's also one of the few cameras in it's class with a flash, so inside photography is also supported.

While the MSRP is around $80, the camera can be often be had at many online stores (w/shipping, coupons, etc.) for under $40.  At this price it provides decent functionality without forcing you into a multi-hundred dollar outlay.<br><br>
