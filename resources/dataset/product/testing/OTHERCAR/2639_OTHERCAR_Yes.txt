            Buying a 1997 Mitsubishi 3000GT was a tough decision. The car has major pluses and minuses. 
On the plus side, it is one of the most beautiful cars ever made. A lot of guys won't admit that the way a car looks is as important to them as its acceleration, handling, etc, but it is. Also, this car drives and handles very well. It corners like crazy and it's steering is as tight as anything I've ever driven.
Negative comments on this car mainly center around two areas. The first is performance. Make no mistake; unless you own the VR-4, the 3000GT is no rocket. No, it won't outrun a V8 Camaro, Firebird or Mustang in a drag race. That's not what this car is about. But if your racing includes turning the steering wheel, this car is fast and fun.
The second negative is about the interior. I agree with every complaint I've heard. It's almost as if Mitsubishi did everything they could to make this car uncomfortable to drive. It is without a doubt the most difficult car to get in and out of I have ever driven. The seats, legroom and headroom were not designed for adult male Americans. After a couple of hours of driving, you're ready for the chiropractor.
After all is said, I still love this car, but it takes someone who truly appreciates it for what it is to put up with all the negatives.<br><br>
