            I have to say that I love my Passat. 

While in business school I interned for a German competitor and learned a thing or two about the car industry. I fully expected to be working in the industry, but things worked out differently. I add this only to qualify my opinions.

As other have noted there are some goofy things about the Passat (window levers for one), but as far as bang for buck goes, it can not be beaten. 

I have a V6, 5 speed with a sport package (sun roof and wood veneer). The V6 packs a 190 hp and is the same engine found in other performance vehicles in the Volkswagen family- most notably the the Audi A6.

In fact if you buy a Passat you are nearly buying the Audi. VW's problems with platform engineering have become your friend. For about $5,000 less you can get almost everything the A4 has to offer except for the steering and the Passat is even bigger. In fact, the Passat is about the same size as the A6 but 15,00o less.

When you buy the Passat you are buying a wolf in sheep's clothing. This car will perform and the inside options are fantastic. It holds up in rough winters (I live in Denver) and the sunroof adds just the right touch for those warmer days.

Do yourself a favor and test drive one.<br><br>
