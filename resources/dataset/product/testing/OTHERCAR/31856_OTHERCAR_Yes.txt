            I recently picked up my wintergreen Outback sedan and I am very happy.  The horizontal 6 puts out more than enough power to move the car and pass at highway speeds and the awd keeps the car flying smoothly through turns.  The upgraded factory speakers (not mcintosh)and subwoofer are more than sufficient for all but the pickiest of audiophiles.  The leather and wood trimmed interior is gorgeous.  My only complaints so far are that the trunk release is manual so there is no button on the remote control and there seems to be a rattling coming from the rear left of the car which I will be having the dealer look at this week.  I am a 19 year old college student and I drive between school (Madison, Wisconsin) and home (Queens, New York) and I am in love with this car.  I would strongly reccomend it to anyone in my situation or as long as they aren't going to be putting four sets of gold clubs in the trunk and won't be hauling 4 adults on a regular basis.
