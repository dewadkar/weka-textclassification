            As a certified GMC Mechanic and years of previous ownership I have found that Dodge makes the most reliable vehicles on the road. They are safe as well as presenting far less mechanical issues than any other vehicle.

I purchase a new Dodge approximately every ten years and am now on my 5 truck. They have a high resale value in the event that regular maintenance records are available and miles are within reason.

I will always be a Dodge owner and have tried alternative products as a second choice of vehicle for my family and ultimately always return to Dodge.

If one had to relate to the astrological signs as a determining factor then I must say that as a Taurus I am strong and reliable so I would have to rate Dodge in a like manner as the Ram is also strong and dependable.
