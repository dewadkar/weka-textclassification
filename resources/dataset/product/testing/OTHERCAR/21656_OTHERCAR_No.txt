            When we bought our house four years ago, in the mountains, the next thing out of hubby�s mouth was I need a 4 X 4. He would be trading in his Chevy Cavalier so I told him to get what he wanted. I would make the final decision being the financial guru in our home. (Meaning I carry the checkbook!) First he did his search, going from dealer to dealer. Once he decided on his two wants, I did some research on the Internet. We both agreed that the <b>1997 Dodge Ram 1500 4 X 4 Club Cab</b> was our best choice. Now off to purchase.

After about a month of haggling and problems with the first dealership we dealt with, we brought home our new truck. There were a few things that hubby was not happy with from the start. These are minor issues that we had to settle for because we were purchasing at the end of 1997 when they were bringing in the 1998�s.

There were things I was unhappy with from the start also. The price was a big issue for me. OK this was a problem with any truck we looked at. I couldn�t fathom paying 1/3 of what I paid for my home on a vehicle. This boggled my mind. My home, hopefully, will last me forever- how long will this truck last me for $28,000? Obviously, I got over it and we got the truck but it makes me sick in my stomach to make a car payment for the same amount as my mortgage is every month.

Back to the <b>Dodge Ram</b>. Our 1997 truck was and still is a beautiful truck. Hubby keeps his vehicles in great shape. I get compliments all the time when I drive it. I man I work with was shocked when I told him it was a 1997, he thought it was a 2000. The truck is flame red with a flame red visor. Hubby has added some extras since we have purchased it also. It looks great, is very comfy, handles well and rides beautifully.

Here are the specs on our <b>1997 Dodge Ram</b> (these are being given to me by hubby because none of this stuff means much to me). It has an 8 cylinder, 5.2 liter, 220 horsepower engine with an automatic transmission (hubby wanted a manual transmission). It is suppose to get 13/18 miles to the gallon (I will elaborate later on the �suppose to�). It has a wheelbase of 138.7� and measures 224� overall and weighs in at a whooping 6400 pounds. Our <b>Dodge Ram</b> seats 6 comfortably and will tow up to 4300 pounds. 

When we first brought this baby home, I was impressed. For a truck, it was a very smooth and comfortable ride. There was plenty of room for the three of us (my youngest wasn�t born yet). My son loves the back seat. It was roomy and comfortable. He liked being able to stretch out and sleep on long trips. The back seat is also roomy enough now that we have another little one. There is enough room for my oldest, a car seat and plenty of toys. The back seat also folds up nicely for when hubby goes on his hunting trips. Everything fits nicely in the back compartment. He just got back from hunting in Canada and two men were able to put all their belongings for a week in the back compartment without any problems.

Another added bonus for my son is HE has cup holders in the back seat. Something we never had before! He also liked the back window slid open and he could tilt either of his side windows open. This actually became a problem; he could open the side windows but could not push them back in. We had to do it from the outside. The back and side windows all have locks.

Our interior is gray with gray carpeting. It has the 60/40 split seats in front with plenty of support and legroom. The seats can be adjusted back or front and can also recline. There is a flip down center console that is a good size. Hubby stores his papers, tapes (this was one thing we had to settle for- we didn�t get a CD player), change and some other odds and ends. The console can be used as an armrest or folded up to make room for three people in the front seat (or just more room for two). There are also power locks and power windows.

The driver controls are in good positions. The cruise control and horn is located on the steering wheel. We had problems with the horn sticking. This has been into the shop twice for this problem. It has two cigarette lighters and an ashtray. There is also a cupholder in the front.

Hubby says it is easy to load and also drives better with a load on the back. He says you don�t even realize you have any weight on the back. 

We haven�t had much snow since we purchased our truck but have had a few occasions that we needed to through her into 4 wheel drive. Once you get it into 4-wheel drive (it can be a stinker to get it in though) is drives well in snow.

The tires that came with the truck were horrible. The first inch of snow we got, we were unable to make it up the mountain without our truck sliding all over the place. So a new set of tires were immediately purchased. Which is another $600.00 expense on top of the $28,000 we already spent for the truck! I was not too pleased!

The gas mileage on this truck is suppose to be 13/18. We average about 8 in town and 11 on the highway. This is not good in my book. It is definitely a gas hog. Hubby gives me the truck in the winter months because I work further from home but I hate it. I let it go down to about a quarter of a tank and it costs me over $30.00 to fill it. I spend anywhere from $60.00 to $100.00 a week on gas. (I own a Beretta and driving the same amount, I put in about $40.00 a week into that)

The passenger side has �handles� for help in getting into the vehicle. There is one on the front and one on the ceiling. This makes it easier for my children and me to get in. There are no handles on the driver�s side, which I do not like. I have to pull myself into the truck by pulling on the steering wheel, which can�t be good for it. We have since purchased steps because when I was pregnant there was no pulling this big �ole butt up.

We have a motorcycle trailer but we have not had to tow it since we got the truck (we can�t afford to go anywhere!) Hubby has pulled many a person out of a ditch in the winter. He even towed a young kid up our mountain after a Ford truck couldn�t make it.

For a new truck, it has been in the shop more times then I think it should. When we first purchased it we had problems with the horn sticking, the air conditioning, and getting it into 4 wheel drive. It was then taken in because it was blowing blue smoke out the exhaust, a gasket needed replaced. It was then taken in for the back-up mirrors both breaking and flopping in the wind. Then again for the 4-wheel drive and once again for blue smoke coming out the tail pipe (the same gasket needed replaced in about a years time). So all in all our truck has been in for service 4 times for major repairs since we purchased it. Again this is a lot in my book and so thankful I bought the extended warranty.

My biggest problem with my <b>1997 Dodge Ram</b> is the dealers. Hopefully this is just in my area but I have been to two different dealers in our area and always seem to get the run around. They take the truck in and say it will be ready in a day, two weeks later, we get it back. We have also had a problem with another Dodge dealer accepting our extended warranty. I own a Dodge truck and it�s a Dodge extended warranty- shouldn�t ANY Dodge dealer take my warranty- according to Dodge NO. This is a long story and I will not get into it here.

So my final thoughts on our <b>1997 Dodge Ram 1500 4 X 4 Club Cab</b>. My hubby likes his truck but is ready to trade her in. Me, I am very disappointed not only in the truck but also in the dealerships. It�s a shame because our truck is a great looking, comfortable vehicle. It was great at first. But as much money as you spent for this truck, I do not think we should have the problems we do.

So you�re thinking- you just got a bad one. I know of three different people who own Dodge�s. The first gentleman is the man we bought our house from. He owned a Dodge and after two years of owning it, he had a bunch of transmission problems. He got another Dodge, saw him about two months ago, he is now driving a Chevy. Another gentlemen I know owns a Dodge truck. Spoke to him New Year�s Eve, he told me �Never again will I buy a Dodge�. Another gentlemen I work with bought a 1999 Dodge Dakota, it has already been into the shop twice and he has only had it for five months.

So would we purchase another Dodge? Are you nuts- how could you even ask a question like that. Sorry Dodge but I can not recommend this vehicle or your company to anyone.<br><br>
