            I own a '95 4Runner.  It was bought with 60K miles.  It was bought from a dealership, a rather large one.  At the time they only had three to choose from.  We had originally went to purchase a Rav4.  However at that time, 3 years ago, it was impossible to find one on the lot.  That's what happened.  There was none on the lot and we looked at the used 4Runners.  They are a lot larger.  More space all around.  When pulled aside a Cherokee, Blazer, etc., they are shorter and lower.  The 4 wheel drive option is what really drew us to the 4Runner rather than the Rav4.  We live in Northeast PA, the Poconos, and with the hills and snow it's essential to have a dependable winter vehicle.  The options to use 4 wheel drive on the fly is great for when you go in and out of trouble spots.  It also has a 4 wheel low, which has been great for those really slippery, high grade hills.  The bottom clearance is remarkable.  Hate to admit it but those curbs, they came from nowhere, seem like speed bumps.  One engine problem we had was a leaking head gasket.  Fortunately, we were able to have this corrected, without cost due to the 100K warranty on the vehicle.  This has been the only unforeseen maintenance.  At 100K we had a major overhaul.  Fluids flushed, muffler replaced, tune-up, etc... The cost of the 100K check-up/overhaul came out to $2K.  It's hard to say exactly if it was worth it.  The original cost was high, a minus.  Maintenance is normal: oil change, tire rotation, etc, is a plus.  The enjoyment of a large vehicle, that can go in the woods, is a plus.  At 100K, time is taking it's toll, the electric components for the back window rusted out and had to be replaced a minus.  The fact that the tail gate goes down rather than out is a large plus as well as the window going into the door rather than out.  The major complaint i have is that it is slow going up hills.  I would even say that it loses power going up a hill.  Over all i do plan to keep this vehicle until 200K, at which time i figure it should be laid out to pasture.  Until then i do not see any major difficulties with it.  Maybe new tires.<br><br>
