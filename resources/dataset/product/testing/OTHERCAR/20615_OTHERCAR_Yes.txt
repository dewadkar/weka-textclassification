            The Audi a4 w/ quattro...well, I own this car, and its been great to me ever since I started driving it.  Basically I have no complaints, or any negative comments...I have had no problems.  I have driven 5,000+ miles...getting great gas milage (which is plus) on my stick shift transmission, which if you are looking to buy this car, or one like it, I would deffinatly say get a stick...not only do you get more control and better gas milage (as much as 258 in a tank that holds 13 or so gallons.

Another advantage to this car is that its 4-wheel drive gives you an added edge when you it snows (which it just did, and gave me a chance to see if it really works in the snow).  Also, the car really grip the road, the handling is amazing....

The stereo is another great plus...even though i didn't get the standard (i got the 6 CD changer) for not a great amount of money i got an incredible stereo with a sweet sound.  There isn't really anything i can't say about the car

Another plus is its massive trunk for added space when you travel....I could go on.I would just recommend you test drive this baby and see for yourself....
