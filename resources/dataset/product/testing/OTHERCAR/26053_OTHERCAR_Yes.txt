            I recently bought this car and I am so happy with my choice.  I never owned a Mazda before and for some reason never thought about test driving one even though it was in my price range.  I had been driving a Nissan Sentra and my lease was up and one of my friends told me that they were so happy with the Mazda and that I should give it a try so off to the dealer I went.  

I am a tall so I was concerned about leg room on the drivers side.  I was surprised that I did not have to push the seat all the way back.  They have made it for someone who is taller then 6 feet and you even have head room so you don't feel all cramped in.  That gave them 10 points even before starting the engine!  

I tested the E.S. model that comes with a little larger engine and it felt very solid while driving it.  It felt like it hugged the ground in a good way.  The brakes are firm and stopped very well.  I fold the steering a little stiff but it did not bother me at all.  I thought is was an EXCELLENT ride!  

The body of the car looks sharp and the interior though is fair.  I choose the package which comes with a power moon roof and power door locks and windows and anti lock brakes.  It also has the remote keyless entry as a standard feature!

The car lists for about $16,000 and in my opinion is well worth it.  It gets about 25 miles per gallon for gas for city drivers which I think is pretty good.  

I think for the price and the quality this is an excellent choice for a car in this class!<br><br>
