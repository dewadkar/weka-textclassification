            Previous to this, the only camera I ever owned was a Canon Sure-Shot, purchased in 1982. It still works flawlessly.

With that having been said, I decided to make the jump to digital. Based on previous experience, I knew Canon would be a safe bet, but to be sure, I researched on the internet like a fiend (for months). My primary requirements were size, size, size, basic ease of use (I'm no Ancel Adams or Jim Brandenberg), and capabilities.

By reading the title of this review, you have no doubt figured out what I ended up choosing. I have been extremely pleased with my choice.

PROS:

The S230 is extremely easy to use and very intuitive. Within a couple of days I was using a majority of it's more complex features without any problems.

The size of this camera is one of it's best features. It literally fits in the palm of your hand, and easily slips into any pocket. And because it's exterior is durable metal and it has its own built-in lens cover, you don't have to worry about it getting messed-up while in your pocket.

Even though I've used the camera in numerous situations/lighting conditions, I haven't experienced a single instance of red eye. I'm baffled. After reading numerous reviews, I fully expected it to happen. But I've followed the instruction booklet's suggestions to a "T", and I just haven't had any problems. So, I'd have to say that the flash is more than adequate.

Battery life is great. I can fill up a 256mb card on one charge. I did by an extra NB-1LH battery to have as a spare, but I have never had to use it during a photo outing. I usually have to swap out the battery after it bonks out due to a long session of viewing movies/photos on the LCD screen.

The LCD screen is great. It's very sharp, and although it's small, one of the coolest features is that after you have taken a photo, you can zoom in on any portion of the photo that you'd like. This makes it very easy to see if the photo you just took is a keeper or not.

The movie feature is great. If you have a large enough memory card, you can take numerous 3-minutes movie clips that are adequate in terms of quality. You can even edit the clip in the camera!

The S230 has a 2x optical zoom. This equates to a 35mm - 70mm zoom, which is great for a point-and-shoot. Most people would list this as a negative, but hey, I knew it had a 2x optical zoom when I bought it. If I wanted a 3x optical zoom (or thought it was necessary), I would have bought the S400! The problem is that the S400 is bigger, and it costs a lot more.

The black and white, sepia, vivid, neutral, low sharpening and histogram features are all really fun features to play around with. One of the coolest features is the Photo-Stitch
mode, which enables you to take a series of photos across the horizon, and then digitally stitch them together to form one, long panoramic image. You can even take a 360 degree photo! And whether you take a photo horizontally or vertically, the camera knows, and always displays the image on the LCD screen in an upright, viewable fashion (in other words, you don't have to tip the camera on it's side to see the vertical photos you took).

CONS:

About the only thing that I think is worth mentioning in the "CON" category is the fact that this little dynamo is smooth and slippery! I dropped it once (the thing just squirted out of my hands), nearly bonking my 4-month-old son on the head. I heeded the advice of another reviewer, and threaded the wrist strap on to the camera, and I haven't had any problems since (although it has squirted out of my hands two more times, but thankfully it merely dangled from the strap instead of falling to the ground).
