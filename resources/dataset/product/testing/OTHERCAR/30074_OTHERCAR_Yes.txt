            I bought this camera based on several features.  First, the Kodak DC 280 has a high final image resolution (e.g., 1760 X 1168).  If you want to print out 8 X 10 pictures this image resolution will capture the sharpness and clarity of your pictures.  Secondly, it has auto focus and 2X digital zoom which allows you to capture close-up shots of your subject.  

In addition, the fixed focus ranges from 20 inches to infinity and the focus range is from 10 inches to 20 inches.  Another feature this camera has is the ability to take close-up shots of flowers.  

My experience with using this camera has been great.  I read the manual in a day and the next day I was taking pictures like a &quot;professional&quot;.  I had no difficulties installing the software and uploading my pictures on my c computer.  It is very &quot;user friendly&quot;.  For example, the manual walks you through the same menu choices that are on your camera.  

For each picture you take you can set the specification you want for that particular shot (e.g., High, better, or good resolution, borders, no borders, contrast, and etc.)  The person who should buy this camera is an individual who does not want to spend weeks figuring how to use the camera and who wants to print out their pictures in addition to e-mailing them.  <br><br>
