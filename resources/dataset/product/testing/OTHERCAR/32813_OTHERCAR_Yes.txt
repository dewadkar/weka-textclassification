            When I moved to Georgia from Texas I had a used Nissan Sentra that I bought from a friend for $3000.  It was a stick-shift but ran okay for the most part.  In the process of getting new plates I had to get an inspection and boy was that an eye opener.  Long story made short, the car didn't pass and fixing it would have cost more than I'd paid for the car in the first place.  This was the first car I'd ever owned new.


While working for Enterprise Rent-A-Car some years back I'd had the chance to drive the smaller 2-door version but my preferences run toward the 4-door version.  It's more spacious than the 2-door.  The seats are real comfortable and I love the way it corners, so easy and so smooth.  It has real decent back seat room for a mid-size car.  The trunk is huge for this size of car and can hold several suitcases.  It also has a cargo net which is nice for grocery shopping.  The gas mileage is decent around town and really good on the interstate.  The only thing I don't like is the default car stereo it comes with.  It's fairly cheap and has eaten several tapes, and doesn't come with CD player.  I imagine you can get that as an option though.


It can be used a a family car as long as the kids are small or if you only have one child.  If you like to take drives in the country it's a nice little sporty car for that as well.  If you have a long commute the seats are comfortable enough and the time will just fly by, unless you are caught in the morning rush hour traffic on I75; nothing can save you then.

After 5 years I still have it and it's in great condition.  The most work I've had done to it was the result of an accident.  You still have regular maintenance, changing the tires, changing wiper blades, 30000 mile service, and so on.

If you need a dependable car with good gas mileage then you should definitely check out the Cavalier.  The newer models look even better.<br><br>
