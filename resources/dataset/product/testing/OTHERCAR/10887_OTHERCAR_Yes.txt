            I was looking for an easy-to-use digital camera (with lots for features for my rare &quot;techie&quot; moments)at a reasonable price.  My objective was to use this camera for work and company publications.  A search of Ebay gave me a sense of what I'd have to pay - $400+.  My bid was accepted on this camera at under $250 including shipping.  

My experience has been positive, though I agree with other reviewers that this camera really uses up batteries at an alarming rate and does seem to have a long delay in capturing a picture.  I really like, however, features such as the dual compact flash cards where I currently have an 8 meg card in one slot and a 32 meg card in the other - no chance of running out of memory during a photo shoot.  Just need to have plenty of batteries.  The pictures are clear and crisp and the Adobe software allows me to lighten as needed for print media.  Using Microsoft &quot;Picture It&quot; enables me to enhance photos even more - all done quickly and without having to read the directions.  I have had other inexperienced people in the workplace use this camera - also with excellent end results.

On the negative side, I find handling this camera to be awkward when just carrying it around looking for a picture to snap.  Without a lens capping feature, my fingers are often on the lens - or the LCD screen or the visual readout on the top of the camera.  I always seem to be cleaning something.  Also picture transfer from the camera to the computer can be slow and a bit cumbersome compared to using a &quot;Smartmedia card&quot; in a 3.5&quot; floppy adapter.  (My wife really prefers this approach.)

Would I recommend this camera? Absolutely - at the right price.  For around $250 this truly is a quality feature-packed product.  At $500 and above the competition closes in and overtakes this camera.  

This can be a superb introductory digital camera that will not generally disappoint the novice to experienced photographer.<br><br>
