            I have a Sony Mavica. Its the MVC-FD73 model, and I love it and I am here to tell you why. First and foremost, I have already almost made up for the cost of the camera in what I have saved in prints. 
The price is rather high, that would be the downside. It runs between $450 and $550, if you are in the market for a camera though, it is well worth the price because you will make up for it. 
This camera does not take the expensive memory cards like other digital cameras. It uses basic 3.5 floppies. Talk about savings! I can throw a bunch of disks in my bag and off I go for an entire day or trip, without ever being afraid I will run out of medium on which to take pictures.
The quality of the prints is beautiful, defiantly as good as the prints I receive from my advantix. I was hesitant about this, because I had heard some bad things. I do however have a high end photo printer, which may make the difference.
The ease of use is incredible. I brought the camera home, charged the battery, and started taking pictures. Of course, I forgot to take the lens cap off on the first picture, but that's ok!!! You can delete pictures right from the camera. Another nice feature with the disks is that I can copy an entire disk, or part of a disk right inside my camera. This isn't limited to just pictures either. I actually copied a word document for my brothers girlfriend when she mentioned her computer had died. We were out to dinner at the time.
I love the way I can point and shoot and have beautiful pictures. I would strongly recommend this camera to anyone that is in the market for a camera. The only time I have noticed less of a quality of prints is when it is too dark, that can easily be remedied by purchasing a torch. They run about $30 but if you spent this much on a camera, you will be willing to spend the extra on the torch.
I recommend buying an extra battery as the life is about 2 hours, and I always shoot for longer than that.
