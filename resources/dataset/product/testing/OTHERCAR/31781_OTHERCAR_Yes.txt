            Since the tender age of 8, I have photographed the beauty that I see only to be sadly disappointed by what actually comes out of the camera.  Artistically, there's too much negative space (space in the picture that is empty.)  Technically, I could never achieve critical focus. Poor depth of field or a failure to have adequate light given the speed of the film, kept a small, inconsequential portion of the picture crystal clear while the object of the photo was blurred. (In case I forgot to mention it, this is just a hobby of mine.)

The average photographer does not need critical focus or great depth of field.  They just want to make sure they don't cut off Aunt Bessie's head when they snap her picture at the family picnic.  Still the Olympus Camedia D-550 Digital Camera takes care of all these problems.  

The camera gives you consistent critical focus whether your using the infinity lens, tele-lens or macro setting.  However, the macro lens does tend to distort the image giving you that "looking through the bottom of the glass" effect.  This is not the camera to take passport photos with.

No matter how badly you have messed up depth of field in the past, this camera will get you sharp pictures automatically in whatever kind of light you're shooting in.  Artistically however, the depth of field is such that there is no difference between the object of your photo and the surroundings.  The effect is a flattening of the photo and a lack of depth.  If this is just a family photo, that is not a problem at all. Someone looking for a technically correct photo or something more artistic should probably stick with film.

The best feature of this camera is the viewing window on the back:  no more pictures with 50% negative space.  You see exactly what will be printed before you click.  Also, no more wasted film.  You can review the picture you took and delete what doesn't pass muster.

You save a small fortune in processing if you have a decent printer and invest in some photopaper.The camera needs an USB port and comes with the software to work with the pictures on your PC.  If you have Windows, some functions of the software will never be activated because they would cause terminal conflicts.  You should be able to get the software to do what you need it to, which is, to load the images in a usable format (you'll have several to choose from.)

This camera eats batteries like nobodies' business.  During a recent vacation to Mazatlan, I had to change batteries daily.

Also, when you purchase the camera, you definitely want to purchase a Smart Card.  The native memory on this will hold two, three pictures tops.  One 16MB Smart Card will buy you 50 pictures and is definitely worth the $16.
