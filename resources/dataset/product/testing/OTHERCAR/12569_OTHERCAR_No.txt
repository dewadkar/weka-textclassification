            I've had two G4 (generation 4) Acura Integra coupes. (I also had a 1993 G3 four-door sedan which I &quot;lost&quot; in a divorce settlement...good riddance to both of 'em!) The first coupe I had was a 1996 GSR, which I traded on a 1997 Type R which I currently drive daily and race in Solo 1 events.

At the time I bought the 1996 GSR, I was looking for a high performance Japanese or European coupe that offered both high levels of scoot and reliability. Compared to the base RS or GS, the GSR is a different car. The combination of a 170hp VTEC engine and larger stock wheels and tires elevates it from sporty economy car to true sports coupe, capable of holding its own with anything in its price range. My experience with other Acuras and Hondas had been they are completely reliable and generally well-engineered, so I expected the same from the GSR.

Sounds good in theory. In reality, I hated the car and traded it on the Type R after owning it less than a year. In attempting to provide a high level of comfort and convenience, Acura ruined the car. I wanted pure performance...what I got was a reasonably capable car unnecessarily weighted down with useless (to me) gadgets such as air (I live in Western Canada where air is not really required), a terribly squeaky sunroof, cruise control and power windows and door locks. I also had some issues with the build quality of the car...in addition to the sunroof creaking and squeaking no matter what we did to try and fix it, there are well-documented problems with the rear hatch banging and the windows rattling in the door frames when partially rolled down. When driven hard (really hard, as in on the track), the lack of a limited slip differential reared its head, giving nasty doses of torque steer and preventing me from getting all the 170hp to the ground. I've never had a problem with a transmission in any of my cars, but after only 20k kilometres the 1-2 syncro started to go, and shifting into 1st at a stop was sometimes impossible.

There's a ton of aftermarket parts available for the G4 Integras to address some of the shortcomings of the car, but I decided it just wasn't worth spending the money. In my view, it's a car that was seriously compromised in order to reach a broader market...and the reality is that most buyers of Integras, and the GSR in particular are more interested in style and comfort than true unadulterated performance.

So I dumped that puppy and got one of the first 1997 Type Rs in Canada. I then proceeded to remove the rear seats, install a roll cage and 4pt racing harnesses, a Momo steering wheel and about $5k worth of Mugen aftermarket parts. The R is everything the GSR pretended to be, and stock it costs just about the same as a loaded GSR. For 1999, the U.S. didn't get any Rs, but they'll be back in MY 2000. 

My advice? If you REALLY want performance, don't even think about the base Integras, and think for a moment about the GSR and then forget it. Go directly to the R.

I'll post a review of the R in the next few days for those that are interested. Guess what? It's not perfect either (pretty close, though).<br><br>
