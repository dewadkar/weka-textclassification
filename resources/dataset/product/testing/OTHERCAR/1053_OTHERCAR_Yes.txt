            The 98 Jeep Grand Cherokee is the nicest sport utility vehical there is.   It has the nice roomy feeling a sedan and the big rugedness of a jeep.   You can use it for long trips and short goes.   This car will never fails you.  It is as safe as they come too.  My mother got into an accident in it which almost totalled the car, she was hit from behind by a bus and in front from a car at the same time.   We thought she was goner but came out the wreck just fine.   So if you want safety and affordability then the Jeep Grand Cherokee is the car for you.   You will look like a winner with this one, there isn't a better choice.<br><br>
