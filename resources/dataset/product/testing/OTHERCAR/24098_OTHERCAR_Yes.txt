            We have owned three Buicks prior to purchasing the 2000 Buick LeSabre Limited. We have virtually had no problems with any of the previous Buicks, so this plus the fact that we have enjoyed the other cars, was a big factor in buying another Buick. 

Since we purchased the car used, the car has more bells and whistles on it than we would have ordered on a new car. However, I must admit, I rather like most of the extras that came with it, such as the heated leather seats.

Some of the standard features just to name a few are: Driver and Passenger Air Bags Front and Side Impact; 4 Wheel Disc Antilock Brakes; Daytime Running Lamps; Power Door Locks/Security Lock-Rear Door for Child Security; Theft-Deterrent PassKey; Tilt, Power-Steering, Cruise; Suspension-Auto Level Control; Air Condition with Dual Control; Air Filtration; Gauges with Tach and Driver Information; Heated Outside Powered Mirrors; Keyless Entry -Remote; Lumbar Adjustment; and Delayed Entry and Exit Lights. 

One of the personal choice features that both myself and my husband appreciates is the Memory Seat and Mirrors. The controls for the memory seat and mirrors are located on the driver's door panel and can be programed to recall previous settings that have been stored. Memory can be set for drivers 1 and 2. This is a great feature for us since my husband is 6'4" and I am only 5'4". You can also store an exit position for each driver.

Being rather short, I have found that the Safety Belts are comfortable for me. I have had trouble with seat belts catching me across the throat, but with the choice of so many seat positions with the 10 Way Power Seats, I have been able to overcome this problem.

Our car came equipped with the Remote Keyless Entry system, but it also has the master key that works in all the locks (doors, trunk, ignition and glove box). There is also a Valet key which only operates the doors and the ignition.

One of the things I can appreciate is the fact that you cannot lock the car doors while the key is in the ignition. Speaking from experience, having locked the car with the car running, I really like this little extra.

The windshield washers do a much better job since the washer fluid comes out of the middle of the wiper blade rather than from a tube at the bottom of the windshield. 

The vehicle has a Passenger Compartment Air Filter. This is a plus for anyone with allergies. The filter removes certain particles from the air, including pollen and dust particles. The filter is located in an easy to change location under the hood at the base of the windshield on the passenger's side. 

This vehicle comes with an automatic fuel injection 3.8 Liter V6 engine. It has a 4 speed electronic transmission catalyst, feedback fuel system. We have found the car has all the "get-up and go" for our needs.  We have taken the car on a couple out-of-state trips and have gotten just under 27 miles per gallon. 

We have owned the car a little over two months and so far have found it to our liking. The ride has been very comfortable, the mileage is good, and we are enjoying some of the extra features. 

I haven't covered all the features, I'm sure, but this is a very nice family car and with our past experiences with Buick's, I would highly recommend it.
