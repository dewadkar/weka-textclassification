            I own a cutlass and I love it, I bought it because it looked good and the price was great, it's a little older but in really good condition. I have had my cutlass for over a year now and all I had to do is change my oil and that's all. I have not had one problem with my cutlass. The drive is great and very comfortable, now it's was used but i love it, it's blue, the inside and outside looks great. If anyone go's to look for a car, test drive a cutlass, they ride great, and glide over bumps. This is my second car I ever had and i am going to stick with my cutlass, I wouldn't give it up for anything.<br><br>
