            This is a counterpoint to a review that did not recommend the Intrigue.  I own a 1998 Intrigue and have been very pleased with my 1 1/2 year experience.  With the exception of a problem with the steering rack that has been a common problem for many Intrigues, I have found this to be a reliable, well-made car that is pleasant to drive.  In response to the complaints of other reviewer here is what my experience has been in the categories of headroom, temperature controls, and the radio controls:

Headroom - I am six feet tall and have had no issues with headroom being a problem.  I don't sit bolt upright but I probably sit as upright, if not more, than the average driver and I still have room to wear a baseball hat.  And this is in an Intrigue equipped with a sunroof that supposedly has less headroom than one without.

Radio Controls - I have found the radio controls to be adequate and provide much more control over the sound than the controls in many other cars.  The concept of small knobs that depress into the radio when not needed and pop out when an adjustment is required is not new and has been used on many radios in domestic and imports alike.  I haven't experienced a lack of durability but, yes, they are small plastic knobs so I can see where they might get broken - but how often do you really adjust the bass, treble, balance, and fade?

Temperature - No problems here either.  My car has the automatic temperature controls but I never use them.  I manually set it to the temperature I want.  My only complaint is that I wish there was a bit more air flow directly to the feet when the heater setting is on.

Overall I am very happy with the Intrigue.  Price-wise it is very competitive with cars in the same class.  It rides well but doesn't have the suspension to handle like a sports sedan as Oldsmobile would like to consider it.  There's plenty of room in the car, comfortable seats, and it has a good sized trunk.  If Oldsmobile continues to build cars like this they'll be able to shake that US car company stigma and will be considered right there with the imports - as this car should be.<br><br>
