            I purchased this car in 1997 with 48k miles on it from Stamford Volvo in CT, under the Volvo Select Pre-owned program.  I've had some mechanical problems since then but overall, I've been very happy with the car, and plan on driving it until it won't go any further.

The interior is well designed, with solid bucket seats.  I've driven 500 miles with one fifteen minute stop for gas and felt great afterwards.  Also, I'm 6'4&quot; and the power seats and tilting/telescoping steering wheel fit me in a number of different positions.  The dash is designed with a nice, uniform aesthetic, and controls are well placed, except for the sunroof control, which is hidden behind the steering wheel (where it's difficult to reach with your left hand while you're putting up the windows with your right).  The trunk is absolutely huge, and there's a ski pass-through and 60/40 fold down rear seats and a fold down passenger front seat, which means I've never been unable to get my stuff home from the hardware store or IKEA (I think they must design their packages to fit in Swedish cars).  Little features like tie-down points in the trunk and a well laid-out engine compartment make you think that maybe the Swedes know something we don't.

The car drives great.  The front wheel drive is great on snow and ice (the only time I've gotten stuck is when I stupidly tried to turn around on a country road and buried the front end in a snowy ditch), as are the ABS disc brakes on all four wheels.  The car handles very precisely, with nice stiff steering.  The transmission is a weak spot, however...  the automatic tends to shift roughly into 2nd on quick accelerations, and I currently have a problem with it reporting an error everytime the weather goes from hot to cold quickly.  I've also had problems with the ignition coil burning out, one of the headlight wipers malfunctioning, the side trim comming loose, and a window not opening smoothly.<br><br>
