            I do a lot of off road driving as I am an avid fly fisherman and spend a lot of time in the bush and on a lot of backroads . I was previously a CHEV man and decided to buy the DAKOTA CLUB CAB 4X4 mostly for it's looks but after driving it for the last 6 months and putting on almost 9,000 miles of mostly gravel and bush trail roads I have found it to be one of the most reliable and sturdy trucks I have ever owned . I am also more than pleased with the fuel milage as it is a 3.9 l V-6 with a 5 speed std trans getting almost 26 mpg Can. 23 mpg U.S. driving in average conditions . As far as things going wrong with it ,to date it has had regular oil changes and grease jobs and that's been it. To sum it up I think it is the best small truck on the market today    <br><br>
