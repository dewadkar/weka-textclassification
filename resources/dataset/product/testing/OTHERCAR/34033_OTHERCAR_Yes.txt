            I have just received this camera this week. It takes amazing pictures! I just took a picture of a small cactus plant and printed it at 8"x10". I could not tell the difference between that picture and another 8"x10" that I have from a film camera!

Ergonomics: The camera is actually well designed. The size shape and buttons are great! I do wish for the camera to be thinner, but that would probably result in a softer pictures and more lens distortion.

Features: This has almost all the features in my Rebel 2000 SLR film camera. Including Exposure Lock, Aperature Priority, Shutter Priority, and Full manual. It also has 3 AutoFocus and Exposure Zones that can be set as Auto or Manual. The only thing that I found bad was the manual focus, but what do you expect from such a small camera. I really like the high speed continuous shoot mode which takes pictures at ~ 2 fps.

Image Quality: So far so good. No artifacts. Color is rich but not oversaturated. One thing I really liked about the camera is the low lag time (the time between autofocus and the picture actually being shot). It also has very low shot to shot time due to an excellent memory buffer. I state this because of the slowness of most digital cameras.

Build Quality: The body seems pretty solid, except for the screen and lens cover. The lens cover keeps slipping off in the case and the screen is exposed to the elements. I definately recommend a case for the camera. The Canon leather or nylon case is excellent and cheap.

Conclusion: Get this camera! Unless you need more megapixels (get the S40 which is the same camera but has a 4 MP CCD) or interchangeable lens (get a digital SLR). This camera is fast, compact, great features, and takes excellent pictures .
