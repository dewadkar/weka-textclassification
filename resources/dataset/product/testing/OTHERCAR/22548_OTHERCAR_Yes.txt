            For the past three years now, I have been sliding around Wisconsin's streets and roads in my rear-wheel drive Volvo.  Granted, I am originally from Oklahoma(and therefore I don't really know how to do any real winter driving)where there really isn't all that much snow/ice to deal with. Since I will be switching jobs (law enforcement)in January, I needed something that would get me to work no matter what the conditions, as well as carry a lot of gear, groceries, and the occasional piece of furniture.  For six months I researched different makes and models and finally decided on the 2001 Tahoe LT.  

Exterior:  A subtle evolution from the previous generation Silverado/Tahoe/Suburban.  Everything looks and feels rather durable, the body panels a well attached (there are no exterior fit/finish problems as noted in some of the reviews found at Edmunds.com).  The doors shut with a solid thunk-no rattling is evident.  Only complaint:  the plastic housing for the mirrors look and feel a little cheap.

Interior: Sumptuous heated leather seats,with great lumbar support. Easy to read gauges, simple radio controls (although the gear selector is sometimes in the way when in Drive).  Comfortable second row seating(I am 6'2&quot;, and I have several taller friends who haven't complained a bit about being cramped in the second row).  The rear seat HVAC controls are a plus, so cold blooded folks can get enough heat moving through the cabin.  The 3rd row wouldn't be too comfortable for adults on trips longer than 30-45 minutes.  It also limits cargo space-but the seats are easily removable-just as advertised.

Engine: Being used to 4 cylinder 160HP turbo, the 285 HP Vortec 5300 (V8) has a lot more torque, although upper end acceleration for passing isn't quite the same as my 89 760.  It does however, get off the line quickly-especially since I don't find the rear end of the vehicle fishtailing if the drive wheels are in any water/slush/snow/ice.  The Vortec is also dead quiet, and the fuel economy (oxymoron)is the best in its class (14-17 mpg).

Ride: The optional Autoride is smooth with its computer controlled damping and self-leveling (great for heavy duty trailering).  Much less bumpy a ride than the Ford Explorers and Expeditions I have driven in the past.

Handling: Having driven Volvos for years (I love their turning radius), the Tahoe feels rather numb.  Control is quick, and fairly accurate, with the suspension, I don't really feel the road at all.  Don't get me wrong, for something as behemoth as a Tahoe, it is rather nimble, but one won't be confusing it with a Honda Civic in a crowded parking lot.

Reliability: Seeing as how I just took delivery of the vehicle yesterday, I luckily haven't had any trouble with it!  Talking to people about service/reliability, I received a rather mixed bag of opinions (although most of the negative responses come from owners of the previous generation (thru 1999).  I will update this section as the vehicle ages.

Value:  I got a super deal through Jon Lancaster in Madison, WI.  I would recommend speaking with them if you are seriously in the market for a Chevy, Nissan or Toyato SUV.   Despite a few cheap pieces of plastic (the exterior mirrors, and inside, the rear plastic subwoofer/jack housing), the built quality is great.  I have also been told that these trucks hold pretty good resale value-though I plan on keeping mine for quite a while.  The options can be very expensive, but I feel they are worth every penny.

Verdict: A solid handling, large SUV, capable of plowing through mud covered trails, as well as running errands around town.  No problems yet with either service personnel, build quality or equipment failure.  I just wish my garage door was wider so I didn't have to fold the mirrors in every time I park.
