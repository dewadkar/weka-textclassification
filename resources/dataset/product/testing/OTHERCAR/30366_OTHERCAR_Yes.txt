My first impression was that it looked cool, and then I thought it was a little ugly and then it wasn�t so bad, but I guess it is sort of ugly and now I think I like it again.  The first time I heard about the Aztec was during the Survivor commercials.  The commercial never gave you a chance to get a good look at the car so I was forced to check it out on the internet.  That was when I had my first good look at the car.  Along with everybody else I�d have to say I thought it was ugly.  While I waited for a local dealer to get one I spent many hours doing research on the vehicle and slowly warmed up to it.  Finally after weeks of waiting  I was able to see one in person.  Once again I drifted to the ugly opinion.  I drove by several times and actually stopped and looked at it a few more and I grew to like it again.  It�s definitely different and I think that�s why people perceive it as ugly.

I searched in and out of this vehicle knowing that I was going to write a review on it.  First off, there are a lot of nice features in this car.  The six disc in dash cd player, power outlets all over the car, stereo controls on both the steering wheel and in the back.  There�s a cooler in the center console that is removable.  You can also use it as a cd holder or any number of things.  The back seats fold up extremely easily.  I didn�t take them out though so I don�t know how easy that is.  In most cases you�d probably never need to take them out considering how well they fold up.  The tailgate is a very nice feature to have in this car.  It has molded seats and cup holders in it.  I�ll quit telling you all the information you probably know and continue with the test drive.

I sat in the back first and noticed the seats were a little stiff.  I don�t know if they�re always going to be like that or if it�s just because it�s new.  The front seats were pretty comfortable.  They have all of the normal adjustments so you can adjust it to your liking.  In the center on the ceiling they had compartments for sunglasses and a garage door opener.  I have to say I was not impressed with these at all.  Not the feature itself, they just seemed really cheaply made.  I definitely think they would break within the first year.  With that exception, everything else in the car seemed really sturdy and strong.  There are plenty of handles all over the place for those wild drivers.  Including one on the dash to the left of the passenger.  There are also several drink holders throughout the car.  

The drive.  I�ll admit to you right now, I am not a car person.  These opinions are only based on how the car felt to drive.  This is where I think I was most impressed with the car.  Very comfortable to drive.  There are two huge side mirrors and the hatch allows you to see out the back.  There seemed to me plenty of viewing room for the driver.  The car also handled really smoothly.  I believe there was more than sufficient power for your typical road driving.  As far as off road goes, it may be a little under powered.  They don�t make any claim to be an off road vehicle.  It will get you where you have to go.

Will I buy one?  Not yet, there is still the fact that it is made by Pontiac.  No reliability there.  I think they have a great idea.  I also think the car will do really well with the younger crowd.  There is just so many nice features that you wouldn�t expect that makes this car a treasure.  If it turns out to be reliable I think this car has a huge future.  If it doesn�t I�m sure there are many other car manufacturers that are just waiting to duplicate it and improve it.  I�m sort of counting on all of the car manufacturers to jump in the race for this type of vehicle.  If they do most likely you�ll see me in line to buy one.
