            I bought the  Fujifilm mx 600zoom camera on the internet. I bought if for the price point of under 500.00 and  figured I could play with it for 3 weeks or so and return it if I did not like the camera. 

While I have some  knowledge of cameras I found the 600 to be a delight to
to use. Its small compact size makes it easy to carry. The quality of the images is outstanding and is capable of making big enlargements.The floppy disc adapter makes it easy to download images directly into other programs and is faster then using Fuji's program. 

The only drawbacks I find is the 4 meg smart media card did not hold a lot of memory about 12 to 15 images. I purchased 2 additional 8 meg cards and to date I have not run out of space. The lens cap which is attached to a string seems to always get in my way. 

Anyone interested in getting started in the Digital Picture field will find the camera to be  a piece of cake to use. This camera is a real beauty....Buy it, you'll love it.
