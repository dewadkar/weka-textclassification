            I bought my mavica cd1000 about 3 weeks ago to replace my older mavica fd81. Boy what a difference in picture quality! Its 1600x1200 resolution compared to the fd81's 1024x768 is far more superior. The pictures are very crisp and clear! I've had a great time using it, I've taken it to an auto racing event and with its fully programmable shutter speed,20x digital zoom (which is 400mm),and steady shot feature you can make the cars stop dead and with that resolution those pics were great! Another feature that i like is it uses an 3in 156mb mini-cd. that allows you to record up to 160 1600x1200 pics and about 350 at 1024x768. And with the cameras 2.1 mega pixels your smaller 1024x768 are very clear. Plus the mini-cd's are not very expensive. the only downfall of the having the cd is that it uses cdr's which are only recordable so once you take a pic its on the disc and if you delete a pic you don't gain and disc space. Also the the cd has to be finalized by the camera before put in your cd drive and if you initialize it again you lose disc space. But you can use the usb connection to view pics and you can hook it up to your tv to view them also. I also like that the camera has a regular viewfinder as well as an lcd screen, it makes it easier for some pics. The camera even can record video and with the 156 mb cd you can record a pretty neat little video.
I would definitely recommend this camera even with is 1299$ price! The initial cost is a little high but to use it its cheap and if you have a good printer you can print very high quality 8x10 pic on photo paper.
I don't have a regular 35mm camera but I wouldn't need one with the cd1000. I could have my photo albums on my pc or stored on a cd. Well I hope I have given everyone who reads this a good idea of what the camera is like!<br><br>
