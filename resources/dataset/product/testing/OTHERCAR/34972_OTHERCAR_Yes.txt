            We decided on the Grand Prix because it had all the options that we wanted at an affordable price.
It is a sporty and attractive car and handles great!
There is plenty of space in rear seat for kids or adults.
The steering is excellent as is the sound system.
The only drawback we have found is lack of headroom in front seats.  A person that is very tall may not enjoy driving this car. My husband and I are not very tall, so it really doesn't bother us too much.
Anyone that wants a nice car, that handles well and has lots of get up and go would love this car!<br><br>
