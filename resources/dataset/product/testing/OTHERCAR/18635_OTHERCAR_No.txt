            Great car to drive, not so much fun to own if you have a problematic one. Of course, my Olds dealer closed his doors 3 months after I bought (no wonder I got such a deal...), and the Cadillac dealer who inherited the franchise has trained monkeys (hey, at least I THINK they're trained) for service technicians. As usual, GM service after the sale sucks. Now that GM has given Oldsmobile the kiss of death, my already low resale value has plummeted even lower. If you could mate the powerful engine and charisma to a Honda Accord, THAT would be the car to buy. Again, this car is fun to drive, nice to look at, and has competitive pricing, especially now with the "Please buy from Olds before we go away entirely!" incentives, but the headaches aren't worth it for me.

I've had interior water leaks, interior dash surface bubbles, intermittent, unfixable power window failures, wierd speedo behavior (it will peg itself while idling!), terrible brake rotor problems, crappy interior trim quality, a scary, cracked steering wheel shaft, tires that can't be balanced, and worst of all, typical GM service that requires multiple visits for EVERY problem, and NOT just for ordering parts. I've had a GM service manager SWEAR that the reason they kept the car for two weeks is so that he PERSONALLY could guarantee the repair was performed correctly this time. A few minutes later, I couldn't drive the car more than 10 feet because the steering wheel was improperly attached. The service manager failed to remark as I escorted him back into my vehicle. I did my best not to do something that would have me going to jail. I left (once again) in my rental Mitsubishi provided by Oldsmobile. I don't even return the rentals when I go to pick up my car now. There's only a small chance it was actually fixed, so I save the rental guy paperwork this way.

If you buy this car you are SENSELESS. Don't fall victim to its charm! Don't do it! Yes, Hondas and Toyotas are bland vehicles without character and soul for the most part. But they work, they hold their resale, and they elevate their owner's blood pressure until they have a stroke! Ouch...my head is starting to hurt again...I'd better stop.
