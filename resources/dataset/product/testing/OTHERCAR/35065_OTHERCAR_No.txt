            Be Carefull!!  The high sticker price of this vehicle does NOT reflect on it's quality or reliability.
  There are several costly failures that are associated with this vehicle.  Starting from the most common, fluid leaks.  These vehicles leak fluids straight from the factory!  (As proven by an acquaintance that drives a car hauler, by the time the truckload of brand new Land Rovers was delivered to their destination, the trucks on the bottom of the trailer were dotted with oil, transmission and power steering fluid.)
    Leaks come from every component that holds fluid.  Common failures on the engine are the rear main seal, cross seals and cam plugs which require removal of the transmission (approx. $2000.00 parts and labor to repair), also the cylinder head gaskets, valve cover gaskets, intake manifold and front crankshaft seal.
    Rover did not build these vehicles for easy serviceability.  If you have one major engine leak, you may as well authorize the repair facility to remove the engine and reseal the entire thing (approx. $5000.00), because other leaks are sure to appear in the short term future.
    Other problem areas are the transfer case, power steering gear box, both differentials and any rubber hose or fluid transfer line.
    I recommend changing the coolant and thermostat twice as often as the manufacturer recommends.  If the engine even slightly overheats, the steel sleeves in the aluminum block will 'drop'(aluminum and steel expand and contract at different rates with the application of heat, the aluminum block expands faster, allowing the steel sleeve to slide down the inside of the block), turning the engine into a $12,000.00 boat anchor. 
    All of the 'high tech goodies' are generally not repairable and must be replaced upon failure.  You know that neat climate control system in the dash? How about $900.00 for the part (plus labor) if the a/c switch stops working. A.B.S. failures are common, and Rover does not give the service technician much ability to diagnose what part has actually failed, often times leading to a $3,500.00 repair while the tech replaces parts until the computer stops pulling failure codes.  I am convinced that no manufacturer can reliably produce an 'active' or 'adjustable' suspension system, and Rover is at the top of the list for system failures as well as cost for repairs.
     My bottom line is this.  When I was a youth, I rode motocross motorcycles.  When I first started riding, I was concerned with 'looking cool' while traversing the track, doing fancy stunts over the jumps and throwing roosts around the turns.  As I matured, I realized that I looked much better going fast at the front of the pack, than I did doing fancy tricks in the middle of the pack.  Most Land Rovers never see a dirt road, much less a four wheel drive trail.  DO NOT buy this vehicle unless you are prepared for ridiculous service expenses just to stand out in traffic!<br><br>
