            We bought the 1998 Lumina so we would have more room for our daughter in the back seat.  She had just turned 9 months old, and it was pretty difficult for us to get her in and out of the back seat of the small car we had at the time.  It was everything we needed.  It not only had the room we were wanting, but got decent gas mileage on top of that (usually 25 m.p.g.). It also has a V6 engine which gives plenty of power.

In the just over two years we have had this car, we have put almost 75,000 miles on it.  We keep the oil changed every 3000 miles and have had no trouble with it.  We have put on a new set of tires, but with that mileage piling up, that's to be expected.

If you are in the market for a modestly priced family car, check out the Chevrolet Lumina.  It will get you where you are going with comfort that will not hurt your pocketbook.<br><br>
