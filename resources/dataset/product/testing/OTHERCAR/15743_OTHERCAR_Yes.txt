            The Audi allroad quattro (notice the lowercase) is an incredible vehicle that combines the luxury, power, speed, and finesse of a fine German sports sedan with the usability of a street-smart SUV.

After having spent the past 5 years driving a Toyota Corolla I decided to spend a little cash and "upgrade" my vehicle. I needed a vehicle that was large enough to hold all the music equipment I lug around but also one that was zippy enough that I could have fun in while cruising the Florida landscape. I test drove various SUV's from the BMW X5 to the Acura MDX and while they were all nice, they didn't give me the sense of power and speed that I needed. Enter the audi allroad.

The 250HP 2.6 V6 delivers smooth power no matter which gear and RPM I am in. I've clocked 0-60 times on it at 6.5 seconds! This car really moves; it beats the other SUV's "hands-down" in terms of power and speed. 

I also love how useful the car is during city driving. The height-adjustable suspension allows me to lower the car during high-speed and city driving. This gives it a zippier and less truck-like feel. However, if I need to go over a median or tree limb or something similar, I raise it to highest level and in a few seconds I have SUV-towering height. 

I recommend this car for anyone looking for a high quality, sports sedan with the practicality of an SUV. The slightly high price gives you complete luxury inside (wood trim, leather, power everything) and Audi has not forgotten anything in their design. 


The gas mileage is my only complaint with this fine vehicle. With the Corolla I was getting 29 MPG/City and now I am averaging 17-18 (depending on how I drive). It's cleaner and more efficient than most SUV's but I would recommend you go with a smaller SUV (Like the Toyota RAV4) if you're worried about gas consumption.

I've had my allroad for almost two months with zero problems and extreme delight. For me, this vehicle is pure luxury-utility-speed. It's a perfect match for those looking for a fast, usable vehicle.
