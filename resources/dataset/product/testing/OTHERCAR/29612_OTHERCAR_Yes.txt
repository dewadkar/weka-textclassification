            What a super machine, a very very bad boy.  Dodge Has the right idea.  Raw Friggin Power with all the creature comforts.   I can't say enough about the good folks at Moss Motors where I purchased the vehicle is Very helpful  with super service. When I did encounter problems Moss Motors was an advocate for me and insured that everything was resolved to my satisfaction. The Hemi is here stay, If I were Ford, I'd be thinking real hard about some muscle.  Why pay more money for anything other than this beast. VAAAAAAROOOOOOOM.

So if you want something more than just a pickup, and want to learn to love to drive again this is the truck for you.
