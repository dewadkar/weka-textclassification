            I've had my 1993 Geo Storm for about 3 months now. I hated waiting around to use my parents car, so i decided that it was time to set out and buy a car. Before purchasing the car, i looked around a bit for one. After some time i came across one for 2500$ with 93,000 miles, and a manual transmission. It was a steal.

The car looks pretty sleek, especially with a supra style wing on it. It's very fun to drive and great on gas. The seats are comfortable to sit in, but you can forget about having people sit in the back. My friends wont come in my car, if they can't sit in the front seat. The trunk isnt to spacious, but it does the job. It'll fit a decent sized kicker in there. Installing speakers was a breeze, too bad they are only 4 inches in the back, but you can easily make modifications to fit any size you want. The storms have a bad reputation around here, its too bad i didnt get the GSI which has 130 HP (the base only has 95) i would be giving them some more respect on the streets.

Driving this car makes me love it more and more. I'm getting poor gas mileage about 20mpg, but that is probably due to the oxygen sensor. My friend who has bad mouth storms, admitted to having fun, when i let him test drive it.

This is a great first car, you can find them for an average range of $3,000. If you can go with the GSI, it'll be worth it.<br><br>
