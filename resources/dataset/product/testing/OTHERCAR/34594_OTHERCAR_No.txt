            If you�re Gay don't try to buy this car!

That's what I told myself after dealing with my local Saturn dealership.

My partner and I were interested in buying a fully loaded SC2. We didn't have enough money for a more expensive 2 door sports coupe, so we thought we would we would go ahead and splurge and get every option on the SC2. We had just seen Saturn's trendy new commercial for the 2001 SC2 and had taken a 1999 for a test drive a few months earlier and had made up our minds that this was the car we wanted.

I'll admit that we did receive good treatment from the sales rep, but once we were handed off to the finance department it became obvious that we weren't going to be attending the Saturn family picnic. Our calls were not returned, we were misinformed in our application and were told we had to put an extra $5000 down on top of the required $1500 on the lease. All this to lease a vehicle... with a combined salary of just under six figures. We later found out that Saturn is the only dealership that charges $600 for paperwork fees alone.

The last thing we were told was that they were too busy and that they would call us. They never did.

The next day we leased a 2000 Cavalier Z24. Not as fancy as the SC2, but with no money down, a $1000 recent grad rebate, a very flexible lease, a sportier engine, a monthly payment of $150 less and excellent customer service, we were happy.

If you�re Gay Saturn may not be the family for you.
