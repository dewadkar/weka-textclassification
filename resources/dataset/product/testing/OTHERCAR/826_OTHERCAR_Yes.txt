            After a couple of weeks spent researching-- here on Epinions and elsewhere-- I finally bought my first digital camera... the subject of this review.

This camera has been around for a little less than a year as I write this (it was first available around 10/2000; I'm writing this at the end of 7/2001), and it is now being sold at a considerable discount relative to its original retail price.

What was I looking for? Something in the neighborhood of 2 megapixels (this camera has 2.1 megapixels), USB connectivity, compact flash card memory, and I didn't want to pay more than $500. What did I get? Well, you can read about the specific features of the camera at Amazon, here at epinions

or elsewhere. I'm not going to bore you by reciting these tech specifications; if you're like me, you'll probably forget most of them before you get to the end of the review, anyway.

What do I like about the camera? Well, I bought it to help in my search for a home. So often I pull up in front of an interesting house only to find that the realtor has failed to stock the little bin with informational flyers. Or there are some flyers but no picture on them. So yes, I can take some notes, but later I find myself scratching my head and wondering "ok... this was the one with the roll-up garage door and the brick wall... or...???" I mean, if you look at a few houses in a day, they all sort of blur together in the ol' memory banks. I'm not going to sit there and sketch the houses in my notes, right? So, I thought to myself that it might be smart to get a good digital camera. I could snap pictures of the houses so that I could later have a record of what I saw.  Something to help my notes, help my recall, etc. I wouldn't have to bother with printing pictures from conventional 35mm film, which, as you can probably imagine, could be expensive and inconvenient for this kind of application.

One feature which makes me *really* like this camera is that it allows me to record a brief audio clip with each shot, if I want to-- up to 45 seconds, I think. So I look at a house, snap a few pictures, and I can record the address, the name of the agent handling the listing, and the contact phone number, and whatever else I need to record. I usually need no more than ten seconds to get all of that recorded. This is a great convenience, let me tell you. It saves me the hassle of having to record this information on my notes right away, a small favor which I appreciate tremendously. None of the reviews I read mentioned this feature, so far as I recall, but in my opinion it is one of the *best* features of the camera.

In addition to the above, the camera is easy to use... basically idiot-proof. I took it out of the box, popped in the batteries (regular AA batteries, nothing special), and was taking pictures within minutes. A few minutes after that, I had it cabled to my Mac, transferring the pictures to my hard drive. The pictures are great looking, with sharp color and plenty of detail. They look marvelous when displayed full-size on my 17" monitor... far better than the miniature black & white pictures commonly found on most real estate listing flyers.

With the default settings, I can store some 125 pictures in JPEG format on a 64MB CF card. At that rate I can look at houses for a whole week before I need to start deleting pictures.

I think this is a great camera. It works great for my house hunting and can even do good macro closeups for eBay auction-type shots. I can't imagine how some other camera could offer better value or more features for the same price. I'm quite happy with this camera. Check out some other reviews... over on Amazon, or elsewhere.

This camera is great. The only thing I don't like about it is the expensive AC adapter and the fact that it comes without a case.

I did search a large electronics store (FRY's) for an equivalent AC adapter which wouldn't cost $60 like the in-house HP-sold adapter. Unfortunately the HP adapter provides 1.3 Amps of current (1300 mA), whereas the most powerful aftermarket adapter I could find at FRY's was rated for 1000 mA (1 Amp).

Likewise, when I bought my first Olympus SLR camera, I paid considerably less than I paid for this HP, and I received a really nice case to go with the Olympus. In light of what I paid for the HP, the money, I don't think it would kill HP to throw in a case. Puhhh-lease!

Otherwise, this is a fine camera.
