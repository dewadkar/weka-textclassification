            I knew nothing about digital cameras when I bought this one!  For a novice user I found it simple and easy to use.  It's not the best camera on the market but for a moderately priced mid-range camera it's loaded with features.  We found the scroll and erase features particularly handy.  The size and streamlined shape of the camera meant I could slip it in my purse or my husband could hang it from his belt - very convenient.

We were a little disappointed in the software though.  I doesn't let you do a lot of editing and the instructions it comes with are a little confusing.  I also wish it had a built-in zoom feature.

I would highly recommend the belt pouch carrying case if you wear a belt regularly.  It's the easiest way to carry the camera!  I'd also recommend at least a 16 bit smart card if you are going on a vacation of any length.<br><br>
