            Graduating from college in '97, I needed a reliable car that would last my 5 long and arduous years at Grad School.  After some consideration, and reviewing my microscopic budget, I decided to purchase a used car. I wanted a sporty looking car that would never break-down (something that used cars are typically known for). After looking at used hondas, acuras, etc., I decided to go to the Saturn dealer. People and reputable magazines said that the Saturn SC1 was one of the most reliable on the road. After test driving a dark blue SC1 - I was sold. 
     After 3 years and 60,000 miles - I am still extremely satisfied. My total repairs over the past years are approximately $600 - front tie rod ends and front brakes. I have run this car into the ground and just like the energizer bunny it keeps going and going. 
     As with any purchase, it does have some drawbacks.  The engine is quite wimpy and unresponsive. &quot;It has no balls&quot; - as my little brother says. I often have Hyundai's outperforming me. But that's the price one pays for reliability. 
    The bottom line is I can sacrifice two years of a wimpy car - as long as I have no major repairs. After I graduate(soon I hope?), I can then buy a more powerful car and finally kick the **** out of those Hyundais!
