            Simply stated: this camera rocks.

For the price, you're not going to find a comparable prosumer camera.  Fuji upgrades their 6900 series with the S602Z, providing the prosumer with:

- 6X Optical Zoom with a fast f/2.8 lens
- 6 megapixel from a 3 megapixel SuperCCD Sensor (yes folks, software interpolation does not deliver what the SuperCCD does)
- ISO 160-1600 (1 megapixel in ISO800 and ISO1600)
- Shutter speeds from 1/10,000 to 15 seconds
- Aperture from f/2.8 to f/11 (which it hit f/16, but hey)
- Automatic/Manual Flash
- Controllable white balance
- Pop up flash (and external hot-shoe)
- 30 frame per second video at 640x480 resolution limited only by your media storage capacity
- Compact Flash and Smartmedia slots
- STANDARD AA BATTERIES

The AA batteries part is nice.  Ever been in the middle of nowhere, and the old battery warning indicator pops up?  It's nice to be able to hit up a gas station for batteries with this camera, as opposed to expensive and proprietary Lithium Ion batteries a lot of cameras are using now.  My recommendation: pick up some 1850  mAh rechargeables.  It costs a lot up front, but it will save you in the long term.

I've been shooting with the 602 since July 2002, and love it.  It's definitely not a "pocket" camera, so if you're looking for something you can take everywhere, this camera will need a companion.

Fuji has been known in the past for providing vivid colors, this camera is no different.  Skin tones sometimes need a little desaturation in post-processing, but for nature photography the vivid colors are amazing.  

The macro modes on this camera are simply amazing.  Fuji has outdone themselves with a "Super Macro" mode -- you can focus on objects as little as 1/4" from the front element of the lens.

Some people have complained about the shutter lag, but compared to other prosumer cameras, the 602 has extremely fast response times.

If you're looking to get away from the point and shoot world or moving to digital from a film SLR and can't yet afford a digital SLR (dSLR), I'd highly recommend this camera for you.
