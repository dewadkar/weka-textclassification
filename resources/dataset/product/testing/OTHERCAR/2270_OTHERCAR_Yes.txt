            <p>I had been driving Hondas and Acuras for years and was ready for a change. I wanted something rugged and sporty but I didn't want a pick-up or an SUV. A jeep seemed like an ideal choice. So I started researching and asking around.
<p>I discovered 2 things. 1)There were a ton of jeeps for sale and 2)The only people that had anything good to say about them were selling them!! Every review I read, including the ones from this website, had nothing but an endless stream of complaints about reliability, safety issues, nasty warranty claim disputes, and other nagging problems. I was disappointed about the jeep but one of the reviews suggested an Amigo as a good alternative.
<p>The Amigo reviews were mixed but at least people had some good things to say where the jeep had none. It was a challenge finding them but I managed to test drive several and, needless to say, decided to buy one... a silver 99' V-6 automatic with 25,000 miles. So on to the review...
<p>The biggest con I had in the beginning, which a lot of the reviews also stated, is the jittery ride. So much so that the whole hour and half ride back from the dealership I was thinking I may have made a huge mistake! I took it to my trusted mechanic and he suggested new tires. It had new tires but they were some crappy brand who's name I don't even remember. He suggested the Michellin Cross Terrain. They are a little more expensive than the average tire but what a huge difference! Very highly recommended and well worth the extra dough! Between getting the Cross Terrains and adjusting the PSI, I have all but eliminated the jittery ride. I still notice it sometimes on a long stretch of grated freeway but definitely not anything to write about here.
<p>The second big con for me is the deceptive storage area(rag-top). You have to take the back window out to hall pretty much anything. The roll bars block your vertical space and are also in the way if you take the top down to carry something big. I find that even though I have a truck/SUV, that my storage capacity seems just a little more than the trunk space of a regular mid-sized car.
<p>Lastly for the big cons is the gas mileage. I know its a V-6 but I expected more out of our modern engineers. I took a cross country trip and the best I got was 20mpg. This is my first V-6 so I may just be ignorant but I was expecting in the high-20's on the freeway. I guess I wasn't ready for that huge jump from my 40+mpg Honda!
<p>I should also mention the recall on the ABS system. I guess a lot of people ended up paying upwards of $500 to get it fixed. It would keep running after the car was shut off and in doing so would drain the battery. Mine did go out but, fortunately for me, the recall came out before I had decided to get it fixed. I had just pulled the fuse to keep it from running and wasn't in a hurry to spend $500.
<p>Almost all of the cons I have read about have turned out to be valid and I have added a few of my own but the bottom line is that my Amigo is a reliable, peppy, rugged, cool-looking, fun to drive car and I'm glad I got it! The convertible top is super cool...especially out here in Southern California where I have it down most of the time. Its much more rugged than the other jr. SUV's like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CRV. The Amigo makes them all look like mini-vans with go-cart motors but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a family due to the lack of 4 doors.
<p>Its also cool that they aren't very common. I get comments from people all the time on how cool my Amigo looks and they ask me how I like it.  If you have always wanted a jeep, save yourself the headaches and get the Amigo instead.
