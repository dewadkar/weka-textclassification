            Rental Car Adventures III: Chevy Metro Lsi
I have driven some bad cars, and some good cars in my days.  I&#146ve driven everything ranging from a $8000 Suzuki Swift to a $65,000 Lincoln Town Car decked out.  And I must tell you truthfully- the Chevy (Geo) Metro is above, in my opinion; only two or three cars in the world.  In other words- this car is almost worthless.  (Note- this review was written in January of 2002- sorry for the delay!)
The adventure begins in San Jose, CA- my &#147Mid-Size&#148 selections were between a Metro and a Mini-Van.  Hmm&#133  I decided that given my Big City adventure for the week, the Metro might be interesting.<br>
After almost taking the door off (if the entire door weighs more than 30lbs I&#146d be shocked) and lumbering inside my first obvious impression was that I was in for a treat.  Like a poo-poo platter treat.<br>
This model as diven:
<i>FEATURES</i> Auto Transmission and Power Locks.  That is it.  No Cassette, no CD, no Power windows, mirrors, rear defrost- nada; zip; zilch- NOTHING!  I didn&#146t dare pop the hood for fear of suddenly wanting to trade a kid his skateboard for the car.  Fortunately for me, there were no angry greasers chasing after me, so I made it out just fine.

Now on to the true part of the adventure- to drive up to San Francisco, haul some 85 lbs of computer equipment and tools down to San Jose on a 4 day journey.
The question is this- have you ever sat in the middle seat on a 737 next to two very large people?  The sensation is similar in the Metro- just take out any hope of feeling anything of the acceleration of a 737.
The cabin was cramped.  Now I&#146m not a small guy, but it seems to me that at 230 lbs I shouldn&#146t need to be getting out the Crisco to get into a car.  Sorry for the image, but yes, it was that bad.

After trying the 101 and nearly getting killed- I actually had to pull into the side lane to get enough acceleration to re-join traffic.  Northern California is not the place for this vehicle.  Actually, I&#146m not sure where the place for this vehicle is period.  Maybe downtown Omaha Nebraska.
My first destination was on the north side of San Francisco, and it was about noon.  In other words, I was totally hosed.

The handling in this car is, frankly, dangerous.  The steering is jumpy and unpredictable from the tiny tires (I forgot to look but I doubt they are more than 12 or 13 inch rims).  You know those bumper cars you drive around at the fair.  It was kind of like that.  So as you can imagine dealing with the curves of San Francisco was nothing short of a true &#147Rental Car Adventure&#148.
Winding thru traffic (well, they were winding around me more than the former) listening to talk radio I kept telling myself that maybe I was doing something good for the environment by driving such a fuel efficient car around.
I was forced to stop and start a forest fire out of rage.
I finally arrived and discovered very quickly that the Metro rides pretty low to the ground with a &#145scrraaaaape&#146 going into the parking lot of a certain major copy chain for which I was contractually bound to attend.
I&#146m kidding.  About the forest fire.  That was a joke.  Put down your placards.

Time came to leave to return to San Jose, and I decided to take the pacific highway scenic route (highway 1 if I recall correctly, forgive me if I&#146ve stumbled and offended some Californian out there).  It was pretty.  Trust me, I had plenty of time to &#145enjoy&#146 the scenery.  To my surprise, I was ï¿½ of the way there when I noticed I was starting to run low on gas.  My fuel-efficient Metro held only a few gallons of fuel.  In other words, run away screaming before you take a Metro on a road trip.  That is unless you enjoy the constant company of gas station attendants named &#145Buck&#146.
I don&#146t give a Buck- but stay away from this car.

Driving in downtown San Jose is much less of a chore than it&#146s neighbor to the north, so the Metro was okay there&#133 Either that or I&#146d become used to my misjudgment, which would explain why as minivans would drive by I&#146d make a little whining noise&#133  oh, wait- that was the transmission.

I&#146m done telling stories.
Buy this car if you want a jumpy, bumpy, slow deathtrap.  But you&#146re probably better off with a cardboard box with wheels painted in magic marker on the side.

I kid!  Remember that I actually have driven worse; but as far as it goes I cannot recommend this car for any practical reasons.  There are better ways to get the fuel economy that this car was designed to give.
