            Its only the right thing to do afterall.  We bought her at 5 years old and have had her for 5 years.  We really could have been a lot kinder to her.  Changed her oil more often, washed her and not let her live in a place where the salt on the roads causes so much rust that you concider a make over for your car.  She took us to many places and back, over 218,000 KM to be honest.  Back and forth across Canada and never costing us more than 200 dollars at the shop.  Her transmission went once and her brakes wore out a couple times but concidering the wear and tear she went through, she held up very well.  Most of our friends with smaller cars got about the same gas miliage as us.  My Lumina has been wonderful for us even if we havent been so great to her.  No major breakdowns at all, no complaints either.  I can tell you this, if we had been a bit more conciderate of her well being chances are she would be on the road for another 5 years instead of 5 months.  I am probably selling her short though, she has proved me wrong before.  Maybe I will get to spend some more time with her than I think.



The price was fantastic, we paid 8,000(Cdn) for her in 1995 and well she more than paid for herself after that I think.  She still is a smooth drive,and she still has guts!Not like those other cars on the road the vroom....she gives it to  ya right in the chest still.Oh and as a Mom with a  large Grocery order..that Trunk is just heavenly!!!  So much room.   Also I have a lot of tall friends that like that they can actually stretch out in her.


I think if you find a Lumina with lower miliage than mine and want a reliable car that is spacious and comfy, then this is her.  Sure 10 years old is a bit but if the price is right  I would say &quot;This is a good solid car&quot;.  We bought her at 5 years old because of all the great things we heard about them.


I really don't think there was a whole lot that I didnt like about his car.  That I still dont like about this car.  I plan on driving her into the ground as they say.  This is the sad part, I will miss her when she goes.
