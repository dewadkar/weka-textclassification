            The Camry CE is a very popular car, and its sales have rocketed up!

I personally love the camry because of its space and reliability. My family has another Toyota Camry (an 80's model) and it's still running. We barely had to take it to the auto shop...probably like 10 times in its 12 life span!

The Camry is luxurious and Toyota is one of the best car companies, because their cars are known for it's reliability. Front seat air bags makes the Camry more comfortable to be in.

I don't know why, but the Camry makes me feel really safe and warm...I guess it's probably cause its power windows and its comfy heater.

This is really a great car to own!<br><br>
