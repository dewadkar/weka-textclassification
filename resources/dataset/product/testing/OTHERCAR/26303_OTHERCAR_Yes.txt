            If your shopping for a car, you should take a look at one of these.  I've had mine for about 3 years, and I couldn't be happier.  I own the ex model in black, which comes standard with cd player and a sunroof. I also opted for the rear spoiler which gives it a sportier look.  It is a nice looking car as is, but you can easily enhance it's appearance with accessories if you choose to do so.  

This is a reasonably priced car.  I paid around 15,000 for mine brand new.  I am usually an impulsive buyer, but I shopped around before making this purchase.  I decided on the Honda Civic because of the price and the reliability. I also wanted something that looked nice, but I have two children so it was more important to have a dependable car.   I got the best of both worlds with this car.  
I haven't had any problems with my car so far, and I am pretty pleased about that.  It is very low maintenance, but of course you need to make sure you get the oil changed when it's due.  The better you take care of it - the more you'll get out of it. That goes for anything really.  You will also get better gas mileage when you change your oil regularly, for all you women who didn't know that ( I just learned that recently)!  Anyway, I get about 35 miles to the gallon on the HWY - which is pretty darn good.  You get a little better gas mileage from a standard than an automatic.  I have a standard just because that is what I prefer to drive.  
For those of you who have kids, the inside of this car is pretty kid-friendly.  The backseat could be a little further back from the driver's seat (maybe even in the trunk ;)  I have gray interior so it hides dirt pretty well.  Overall, it is easy to keep clean even with little ones.  The trunk is pretty spacious, and the backseat folds down for extra room.  The glove compartment is rather small, but how important is that anyway?  There is a center console for odds n ends, and also storage in both doors and in back of front seats.  I think that anyone who drives this car will be satisfied with it's performance.  I love mine, and so does everyone who rides in it.  I really trust the Honda name, and my next car will probably also be a Honda.
