            When I bought this car I was looking for a durable, reliable car to safely transport my three children and I around town.  I didn't think that I was asking too much of the Dodge Grand Caravan, I rarely even took it out on the highway...I rarely drover faster than 35 mph in it...I figured with this minimal amount of wear and tear that the van would last for 10-15 years...Well, I guess I set my sights to high and was expecting too much from this car because it has brought  nothing but problems since I bought it.  
First, the car broke down......three times!!  One new transmission, three re-alignments, one shock replacement and two mufflers later, the car is doing just fine.  I have spent close to 30,000 dollars buying this lemon and caring for it since I purchased it.  I could not be more displeased with the performance of this car and would strongly discourage anyone from even considering it when looking for a new car.<br><br>
