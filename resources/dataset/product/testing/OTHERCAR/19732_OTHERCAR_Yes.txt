            Want to drive in style?

I would recommend an older S-class sedan.  These cars are available on the market and good deals can be easily found.  The Mercedes I drove was silver blue with blue leather interior.  The sedan was loaded with every option available.  For a car that had over 100,000 miles, it still drove beautifully.  The stand still acceleration was not very impressive but the passing power was adequate. The existing owner said that at its best on the road it only ranged approximately 15 miles per gallon.  In town it was much lower and it has a thirst for premium fuel only.  The size of the car makes it extra difficult to maneuver and park.  Overall, the car is still impressive and very nice.  This car would best suite an owner that primarily used it for highway driving.  <br><br>
