            I have my new 2000 Toyota Tacoma for 3 weeks and absolutely love it.  The truck is everything I expected and more.  It has ample room in the extended cab model and more than enough power in the 2.7 liter 4 cylinder engine if you have to haul/tow or go off road.  I have used the truck to haul cut wood for my fireplace as well as tow a trailer.  I bought the truck because I do a lot of outdoor activities.  The truck has a high profile feel with good visibility with it's large side mirrors.  I have a cabin in the mountains and was able to drive to it for the first time with relative ease. The truck does have the off road package and the tires and frame help up well when it &quot;got a little bouncy&quot;.  I definitely recommend that you take a look at one if your serious about a tough work/pickup. Just can't wait for winter to see what that has in store !!
Unfortunately, I haven't owned the truck long enough to write anything negative. Sorry.  :-)<br><br>
