               It is difficult for me to not recommend a car that has been so reliable but simply put, it is not up to par with the Kia Rio(attractive but questionable build quality, based on Ford Aspire chassis) and the Toyota Echo.(so ugly it's almost cute but it is a Toyota, that almost guarantees good build quality)I have owned 3 Suzuki cars and have gone over 500,000 miles with them with only one major engine failure. That was my first, a Chevrolet Sprint Turbo (don't let the name fool you, it's a Suzuki) that was modified to allow more turbo boost. I am confident that without the modification it would have far exceeded the 140,000 miles I got out of it.
   All three cars had window regulator problems. This is easily fixed by applying Loc-tite to the mounting screws for the window regulator and lubricating the assembly wherever it moves. Strangely enough, it doesn't seem to be done at the Canadian factory where they are built. The interior door handle will break at or around 100,000 miles. I haven't figured out how to prevent that from happening. The part is cheaper at Chevrolet.(the Metro LSi is essentially the same car) The mufflers have all rusted out at or around 60,000 miles. Again, it is a cheap repair and will then usually outlast the car. While you are at it Loc-tite the door strikers in place. With the doors properly adjusted and tight the car is a lot quieter.
   The worst part is that Suzuki produces the parts to make this a fantastic commuter car. The Swift GT had a DOHC 16 valve with hydraulic lifters 100 hp engine, 4 wheel disc brakes, supportive seats that look like they came from a Nissan 240SX, and front and rear sway bars. Retune the engine for a little more low end torque and a little less top end horsepower (My GT easily overwhelms the front tires in the 1st two gears) Install the brakes and swaybars with some realistically sized tires and you have a car to compete with the upcoming Mini from BMW while maintaining some civility.
  Interior-wise, the front has a remarkable amount of leg room. I am 6'3" and while I do have to have the seat reclined slightly and all the way back it is still quite a bit roomier than the larger Paseo or SC2.
   Just an addition to my previous opinion. With gas prices here (Dallas/Ft.Worth) above $1.60 a gallon, I felt it necessary to add what kind of mileage I get. My Swift GT averages about 35mpg on each fill up. My old Swift GA sohc averaged over 40mpg with an all time high of 67mpg on a trip from Denver to Ft.Worth on US287. This was remarkable because of a strong northwest tail wind and cool spring temperatures that allowed me to drive with the windows up and the A/C off.
