            I bought my 240sx convertible new in 1993. Test drove the Celica, Mustang, Camaro as well as other comparatively priced convertibles, before deciding on the 240sx.

The "Limited Edition" convertible came with many options standard (the only manufacturing option was A/C). My understanding is that the convertible top was added after the factory, in California somewhere, but before it hit dealerships. (ASC-conversion). (Which is why it came as-is loaded with options)  Over it's lifetime only 20,000 or less were made, hence "Limited Edition". 

Standard features:
155 HP 2.4 L DOHC 16 valve engine
Independant multi-link rear suspension
Power 4 wheel disc brakes
4 speed automatic overdrive transmission
power rack-and-pinion steering
rear spoiler, allow wheels, power front and rear windows and door locks, cruise control, am/fm cassette.

Comparative convertibles rated only 94-140 horsepower.
Published benchmarks: 0-60 in 7.3seconds
Trunk space:  8.57 cu ft on coupe (less on convertible)

Autoweek and Motortrend magazines covered the specifics pretty well in the their 1992 and 1994 magazines.

Okay, enough specs, now for the commentary:

In almost ten years I have had to do hardly any repairs to the car. During the first month I had it, there was a problem with the driver side rear brake freezing up. The dealer repaired the problem. I had new brakes put on at 65,000 miles, and again there was a problem with the rear driver side brake freezing up. Small problem, but I do wonder if it's a manufacturing thing.

I had scheduled maintenances done during the five year warranty, with no problems. The heat shield undercarriage has come loose in several different spots, almost constantly. It usually costs about $35 a shot to remove the offending piece. (Apparently this is a common problem with the 240's, and the heat shield isn't necessary, so pieces can be removed without being replaced). A loose piece causes a rattling sound, especially at 4500 rpms. Nothing to worry about, I just keep getting the pieces removed to eliminate the rattle sound.

I have had a problem with electrical system in the last two years. For a while, one headlight would turn on by itself, if it wasn't driven for a few days. I have no idea why this would happen, but it would drain my battery. Then, mysteriously, this problem stopped and the Other headlight (low beam) stopped working. A new headlight was put on, but the low beam still didn't work, so it's something else wrong (not a fuse). My regular mechanic can't find the problem, so I will have to take it to Nissan and pay to have them figure it out.
(UPDATE: I had my local dealership look at the headlight problem. They replaced a "switch" (internal relay of some sort), cost:$180 (part was $74, 2 hours of labor). A little pricey, but the problem is fixed. I feel confident that it was worth paying the dealership labor prices rather than take a chance on a local mechanic who might have tried several routes to fix it, and probably would have ended up costing more.)

Otherwise, I have only replaced the brakes (as mentioned) and the battery (due to the headlight draining it so often) in the four years since the warranty expired. Both are pretty routine maintenance for 70,000 miles. Absolutely the cheapest repair record of any car I have seen.

The body is another subject. My top was vandalized about two years after I bought the car. I had it patched, which may have contributed to the lifting mechanism getting messed up. (Understandable.) Unfortunately no one at the dealerships knows much about fixing the mechanisms, and the one dealership actually messed it up further by removing some necessary nuts and bolts. The top is automatic, although you do have to lock it by hand (can be done from the driver's seat) once it is up. However, if you are looking at buying a used 240, inspect the mechanism very carefully. If there is anything wrong, it may not be easy to fix, and your local Nissan dealership probably will not be much help. All replacement pieces are ordered from the company in California that converted the cars into convertibles, they are not available from Nissan.

Additionally, there is no rubber molding on the doors, and they are bowed out to beckon every ding and scrape you can imagine. Both doors were well dinged up when I had it repainted in 96, and again are all dinged up from people opening their car doors onto mine. I cannot evaluate how the original paint held up against sun, because I did have it repainted.

When I lived in a snowy climate, I found the 240 to be treacherous driving in even an inch of snow, due to it's rear wheel drive and light weight. Not recommended if you will be driving it in snow. In rain the 240 hydroplaned a few times, but I replaced the tires with aqua-tread types, and haven't again had that problem (even though I now live in a rainy climate).

The interior has held up well. The backseat is unbelievably small. An infant car seat had to be rotated on it's side to get into the back area, though it did fit well once inside. An adult in the back seat requires that the front seat be moved forward to the point of real discomfort. If you plan on using the back seats more than occasionally, again, I would skip this car. The trunk is made smaller by the convertible top "hammock" area, where it folds down into. I can't fit a stroller in the trunk besides an umbrella type, forget about 2 large suitcases.

But despite the drawbacks, I love my 240sx convertible. I plan to keep it until it "goes", which I think is 50,000 or more miles away (I have 70,000 on it now). It's fast, handles like a slot car, is fun and sleek, and I love having a convertible. It's only used as the "family" car when my husband's car has to go to the shop (which seems like a lot, compared to my 240!) If it was needed as the "family" car, I would definitely have to get rid of it, it's just to cramped for more than 2 people.

Gas mileage is very good for a sports car, I average about 26 mpg, and about 400 miles or so on a tank of gas.
