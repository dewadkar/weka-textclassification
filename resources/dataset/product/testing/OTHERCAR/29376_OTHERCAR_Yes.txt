            My CR-V is a joy to drive.  It rides like a car and handles like a dream.  I bought the CR-V to replace a ten-year-old Honda CivicWagon.  I have been impressed with the way that Honda vehicles in general last forever.  The maintenance is minimal.  

The CR-V is large enough to carry several adults comfortably along with plenty of luggage room.  My typical week includes 500-700 miles of driving in both rural and heavy traffic areas.  I am very pleased with the performance of the CR-V.  It has the get-up and go to move with the heaviest rush hour traffic.

My favorite feature is the real-time 4WD.  I don't have to worry about the northern Ohio weather.  Last year, we had several ice-storms.  The CR-V didn't hesitate once.  <br><br>
