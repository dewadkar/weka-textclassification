            The Jeep Cherokee, and Jeep products are dependable vehicles for use in all sorts of weather and all sorts of driving conditions.  The ability to switch from 2-high into 4 wheel drive without turning hubs is an added plus.  The Jeep Cherokee can go through mud and snow without problems and will handle ice without much of a problem.  Sometimes it is necessary to switch into 4-high on ice.  Of great importance is the type of tire tread on your Jeep.  Typical Highway tread is not going to get you through the snow in the mountains.  The unfortunate thing about a Jeep is that Jeep has been owned by different companies over the years and incorporate their parts into the Jeep drive train.  This could mean the cost of repairs to an item such as the transmission could vary greatly depending on what year the Jeep was and who owned the company at the time.  I would recommend Jeep to anyone and I would buy another myself.<br><br>
