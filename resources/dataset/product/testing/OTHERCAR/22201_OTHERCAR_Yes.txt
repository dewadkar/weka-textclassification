            This was my first digital camera, very easy to use.

It was also easy to download the photos on to my computer and save them.  This is a 2.3 megapixel digital camera that takes photos as large as 1760 x 1168 and saves them in the JPEG format. 

This camera can be connected with a USB cable or serial cable. These connections are on the left side of the camera clearly marked. There is also a video output that is selectable between NTSC or PAL format. 

There is also a 3X digital zoom with this camera for even closer shots. 


You can if you wish take your photos using the LCD display instead of the viewfinder. 

The built-in flash has settings for Automatic, fill, and red-eye reduction. I have always used it in the automatic mode because it will only flash depending on the light in the circumstances. 

It is fairly small and light in weight. 

Four AA alkaline batteries come with it and you can use NiMH, NiCd or lithium type batteries.
