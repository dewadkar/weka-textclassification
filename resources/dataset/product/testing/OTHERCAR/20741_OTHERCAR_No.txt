            I drive a two door, 2wd (rear) S10 blazer for work.  It is okay if you want to look like you have an SUV, but don't expect to do any offroading with this model, I can't say about the others.  Also, it is nearly impossible to check blindspots in the two door model due to a stabilzer bar.  Because of how far back the rear window is, and the rear seat head rests, it is difficult to see out of the rear view mirror.  The handling is not the greatest, but it is ok if you don't try to hotrod in the rain or in gravel.  It has automatic headlights, and the radio stays on after you turn it off until the door has been opened.  The head and leg room is great for the front, but the seats are difficult to adjust.  I have never had anyone in the back.<br><br>
