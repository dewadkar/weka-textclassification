            We just leased the 2000 Chevy Venture. We have two small children and the extra room is just wonderful! We can now bring 2 - 3 other people with us when we go somewhere. The van drives extremely well - a very smooth ride with a very good turning radius. The only problem is that there isn't much cargo space if you've got all the passenger seats filled. There is an option for an extended base - but that adds to the price. The cargo nets are a nice feature, too. You can put things down on the floor (in the net) and they won't fly around the vehicle. There are lots of nooks and crannies to put your &quot;stuff&quot;, and plenty of drink holders. The seats fold down to tables which can be handy. We love the Venture and would recommend it to anyone!<br><br>
