            Man, that car looks good!
As I signed the paperwork I had the horrible feeling I was making a mistake. It's too expensive, I should wait until I can put more down, I can get another winter out of the Grand AM, it's only 8. But I signed anyway. 

<b>Systems</b>
What a car. This 240HP engine should be on the space shuttle, because it's  got so much power it scares me. The super-abundance of power is a wonderful thing as is the quick braking. This is the supercharged V6. It even has a little indicator on the dash to show if the supercharger engaged. I like that word. Supercharged. It certainly is. This car is so much fun to drive, with the moon roof open, the windows down and the stereo going, that I want to go drive it now. Just for the fun of it. Going as fast as you are comfortable going, and knowing the car has a huge power reserve available is a very happy feeling indeed. The ride itself is wonderful, very soft for the passengers, but with lots of feedback for the driver. 

Sometimes I pause in the parking lot as I'm walking up to it, just to take it in, because it looks so good. The silver finish glows in the moonlight. The styling is so <i>defined</i>. Each part of the car looks like it wants to go fast, even standing still. I'm always happy when I get home from a trip and -get- to drive home. No matter what rental I got, I always look forward to driving my car.  

As far as engine noise- it purrs. When I first got it I had to pay close attention to the RPM gauge to make sure the engine was running because I couldn't really hear it inside. If you can get the heads up display, there is nothing cooler. My friends say the dashboard, with all the controls for power everything, looks like something right out of Star Trek. There is plenty of space in all seats for my friends, the seat warmer feels oh-so-good in a cold New England weather. The leather seats are <b>very</b> comfortable and the seat controls are easy to use and put you precisely where you want to be. Even the rear seats offer plenty of room. There is a center mount fold down in the rear seat that provides cupholders, and an armrest for rear seat passengers and gives access to the trunk. The fold down can be used to carry long objects like skis. There is plenty of room in the deep trunk. I usually carry a couple of gym bags, my flight bag and a trip suitcase, and there is still plenty of space. The CD player and the sound system is wonderful, it never skips and all the controls you need are provided on the steering wheel. The six speaker system makes the music really come alive, especially when played loud with the sunroof open.... 

<b>Now the bad stuff.</b>

 Take my dealer- please! (sorry) Why is it that Pontiac can't arrange to get better dealers? Their customer service is downright pathetic, the moment that you sign the paperwork and take the keys they treat you like scum. Example; it took two weeks to get a sticker because &quot;the guy that does that isn't here&quot;, &quot;we don't do that after 5&quot;, &quot;the machine is down&quot; and on, and on. If it wasn't free, I would have just gone elsewhere. I can't get decent appointments to even get my oil changed. I have to take time off from work because it takes them 90 minutes to do basic service? Hire somebody from Jiffy Lube already! God forbid the car breaks, then these dealerships really treat you like dirt. If they didn't make such great cars, I wouldn't buy from Pontiac because their dealer community hasn't learned to treat the customer well. I was tempted to buy a Saturn because their dealers treat their customers great. I have to see if Saturn will work on a Pontiac. 

As for the car, other than a small piece of loose interior trim, it's perfect.  

**Update**
So it's 10 months since I got my Grand Prix and I'm happier now than ever. The summer driving in this car is even better than I expected. It gets an average of about 21 MPG and hasn't required any repairs. There is another piece of loose trim but the dealer is supposed to take care of that. I had to schedule service 10 days in advance. Things aren't supposed to make you happy, but when I get in this car, I'm happier.....<br><br>
