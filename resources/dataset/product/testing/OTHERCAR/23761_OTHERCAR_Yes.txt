            I bought my 1992 Saturn replace a car that was falling apart.  Both my parents have Saturns and I had friends who had Saturns.  It was sort of like their commercials... everyone I knew had one!  I was thrilled because the car was wonderful!  In the last 8 years, the car has helped me move a dozen times and still remained the most reliable car I've got, although my husband argues his truck is better (yeah, sure).

The car was with me through college when my money went towards 'other activities' instead of maintenance.  It's never broken down on me, although it does seem to run out of oil every 6-8 weeks.  Several times I've had the oil gasket replaced, but it hasn't helped.  

The car is very comfortable.  I'm not the kind of person who digs leather or fancy things in a car, though.  My requirements of a car:  Does it run reliably?  (yes)  Can I sit in it for long roadtrips?  (yes)  Does it have music?  (yes)  

I used to drive from Virginia Beach to Washington DC (about 250 miles) every week for a year.  And I made a lot of roadtrips to upstate New York.  Now that I've got two children, the space seems a little smaller.  The trunk is full with the double stroller and a couple of bags.  The back seat does give us enough room for both car seats without having the kids close enough to touch each other (big bonus!).  There isn't a lot of room for their legs in the back seats, though.  If we have one more child, we'll have to upgrade.

When I've had repairs or work done on it, I've always taken it to a Saturn dealer.  I lived in Virginia Beach and was very happy with the service I got from them.  I fell asleep at the wheel one night on my way home and had to have a front wheel replaced.  I was concerned about the way it felt when I got it back.  A service person drove around with me for 15 minutes talking about why it might feel funny.  He reran a test and showed me the results; the car was fine.  

I will say you can't trust all Saturn dealers.  We moved to Maryland and took the car to a dealer to get the state inspection done.  The car had *just* passed Virginia state inspection, so I didn't expect anything needed to be done.  They called with almost $3K in repairs!!  Then told me they hadn't taken it to another place to get the inspection, but that's what they estimated needed to be done.  I said I couldn't afford that and only wanted repaired what was necessary.  The state inspection came back with about $2K in repairs!  Two tires needed to be replaced.  When I had tires replaced in Virginia Beach, I always got the same tires as were on new cars.  The Silver Spring dealer gave me what looked like used tires; I had paid almost $90/each.  I asked about them and was given a you-don't-know-anything-about-tires.-these-are-fine story.  Two days later one of the tires popped.  I took the car to a nearby Merchant's and had both tires replaced.  I swore off Saturn forever.  I still loved my car, though.

My experience with that Saturn dealer led me to buy a Honda for my husband last year.  We wouldn't have ever gone back to Saturn, but the driver and passenger window both stopped working and Merchant's couldn't fix it.  I'm living in Virginia again, so I took the car to the Alexandria, VA Saturn dealer.  I've had just a few occasions to go there (to fix the windows and to get the car fixed after the car had been driven into a couple of times), but I feel like I've found a dealership with the same belief in quality and customer service as I had in Virginia Beach.  But my automatic trust of Saturn dealerships is gone.  

My car is getting on in years.  I still remember all the times it was on E... but didn't leave me stranded on a roadside.  I remember the cold mornings when I was hoping it'd not turn over, so I could go back to my warm bed.  And (this is the *only* time I'll confess this) I can't count the number of times I've told someone the car started rattling a little and they point out that I'm out of oil... When was the last time I had it changed?  Ummm... I'm sure it was recently!  So now that the overhead lights are broken and the shoulder seatbelts don't roll back and forth and the tape player doesn't like to play all my tapes, my husband is telling me to get a new car.  But I can't get rid of my Saturn.  As a college kid, I abused it and now in it's golden years it's still running fine.  My car gets me from here to there without guzzling gas and that's what's important to me. <br><br>
