            I've had my S10 now for nearly five years and it has been an excellent truck.  Except for standard preventive maintenance, the truck has not had any work done on it.  There were two recalls that were handled very quickly and professionally by the local dealer.

When I went looking for a new truck in '97, I looked at all the compact and mid-size trucks.  The imports were generally priced much higher and had less features than the domestics.  I drove the Ford and it had a typical truck ride, that is, very bouncy.  The Dodge scared me off with it's mileage figures, where it's highway mileage was the same as the Ford and Chevy's city mileage.

The Chevy had a much better ride than the Ford, bordering on carlike.  The 4.3L V6 that I chose accelerated quickly and got reasonable gas mileage.  In addition, in '97, Chevy was the only manufacturer offering a third door on their compact pickups, a definite plus.

Over the years, the truck has averaged 20 mpg in mixed driving.  It can tow nearly anything you put behind it (mine has the towing package with the upgraded suspension and lower ratio axle).  

I've been very satisfied with this truck and will probably buy another when this one bites the dust, which shouldn't happen for quite awhile.
