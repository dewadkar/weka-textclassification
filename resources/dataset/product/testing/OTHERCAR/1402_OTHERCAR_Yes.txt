            I had been looking for a automatic car to replace my 02 Hyundai Elantra, and after 3 weeks of looking I found what is now my 02 Mazda 626. Silver in color, and only 9,300 miles on it. I bought it for a price of $13,000, which to me was a steal! 

Getting right into it, here is what I like and don't like about the car. The car comes with great standard features, and for a 20K new it should, which includes power windows, locks, and mirrors. Tilt steering, and a adjustable driver's seat are also great standard features. My car goes above this and has keyless entry and what it neat about this is there is a button on the remote, so that you can open your trunk, which is helpful when you have a bunch of groceries in your hand.... :) Comfortable seats, and overall a neat a well-spaced out interior. Every dial is in reach, so makes for easy changes from everything to the climate controls, to changing the turn signal. And like the Mazda 626 back in 1989, they still have the oscillating vents. The tires that come with the car are great handling especially in the rain! Excellent views through all the windows make virtually no blind spot.

Now every car has its negative sides to it so here goes. Under the engine it has a small engine for such a large car. A standard 125 Horsepower 4 cylinder engine is good on gas, but not on power. Doors are a little hard to close, maybe just the design. I have now 13,000 miles on it, and have had no mechanical issues, except one. The transmission seems like it shifts harder then normal. I have been to two dealerships 2 different times. They both said it is fine, but it is a thing I am going to keep a eye on. Leg room for me being 6'2 is a little cramped in the drivers seat, which is the only thing I miss in my Elantra. 

Overall it is a great car, and I will be keeping it around for many years to come!
