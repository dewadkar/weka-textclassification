            I highly recommend this digital camera.  The main reason I purchased the Olympus D-340, was for taking pictures for the auctions I put on Ebay.  I do not print my pictures, I use them on the net.  I did not want to spend a lot of cash.  For $300 I believe I got a really high quality camera.  The 1.8&quot; LCD screen has proven to be very accurate.  There is a 2x zoom macro on this camera - very useful for showing the detail on auction items.  The included Adobe software is an added bonus.  This camera does include the cable to download the pictures onto the computer.  If I had to choose a bad feature on this camera, it would be download speed.  There are accessories available to speed up this process however.<br><br>
