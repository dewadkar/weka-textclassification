            8 month review:  Had &quot;Rudy&quot; since May of 1999.  A couple more days and 2000 hits.  Tracker still running great.  Weather is strange in Denver and the snow we've had so far, hasn't put a dent in traveling.  We've taken an 800 mile trip down south and being 6'3&quot; and 210lbs, the seating wasn't the greatest, but it was bearable.  I see a lot of Trackers here and they all seem to be in really great condition...no matter what year they are.  Chevy has a real winner on their hands here.  Warranties are much better than they used to be.  I think I'll pickup a Chevy or GMC truck next time to replace the Dodge Caravan.<br><br>
