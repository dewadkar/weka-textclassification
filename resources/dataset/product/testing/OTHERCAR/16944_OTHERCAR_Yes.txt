            I am on my second Outback wagon.  First my wife and I had a 1996, and now we just leased a 1999, and I cannot say enough good things about this car.

My wife wasn't thrilled about a wagon, but this time she had bought one before we could even discuss it.  We love this car, rugged, but comfy, lots of room, all-wheel drive, safe, and cool!

This is a great car for families (we had 1 kid and 1 dog), or just people who like a rugged cool looking car, that drives like a car.  Nice peppy engine and great handling.  And decent mileage as well.<br>
