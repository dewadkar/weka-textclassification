            I have had my 2000 LS for about 6 months with no problems at all.  I test drive just about every SUV on the market before buying.  Solid truck with the best looks of any SUV, in my opinion.  The engine is powerful, feels like a sports car off of the line.  Good handling and enough cargo room.  I am in Canada, so one problem is that there are not that many Isuzu dealer ships around.  There is some wind noise at highway speeds.  Some people complain about vibration, but mine is very smooth at any speed.  Anyone in the SUV market should check it out.<br><br>
