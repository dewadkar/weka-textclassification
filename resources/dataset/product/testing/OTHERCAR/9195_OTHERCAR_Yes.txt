            Leased a Lexus GS300 in 1995, before they changed body style to current style. I now have 140,000 miles on my car, and I have had absolutely no problems, outside of wear and tear. I'm on my third set of tires, and on the verge of having to do a brake job. Lexus' service is outstanding. Once, they failed to do what they promised, and as a result, my next service was done at no charge. I originally leased the car because I wanted a luxury car that I could maintain and keep for a long time. Only thing that I don't love about the car, which Lexus has addressed with current model, is power. I would describe the old GS as a Japanese ride, very soft, very comfortable, very much insulating the driver. Current GS is a hybrid of Japanese and German ride, with better steering, better power at low end, and a bit stiffer ride.

In summary, best things about driving Lexus GS: comfort, quality of workmanship, prestige, dealer service options (loaners, pick-up and delivery, shuttle service).

Worst thing about driving Lexus GS: cost of service if done at Lexus dealer. They are top quality, but you will pay for it. My regular oil change maintenance is usually a $90 service.
