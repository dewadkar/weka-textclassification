            I was so excited when for my birthday my best friend bought me a digital camera.  While I was very appreciative of such a great gift the Largan Lmini 350 was a huge disappointment.

I don't know where the wonderful quality pictures in their brochure came from that we looked at but they certainly were not taken with this camera!

Here are a few problems I ran up against with this camera:

*  When I took out the manual to read up on how the camera worked it spoke all about Photo Suite 9.1 which is the program used with the Largan.  Only problem was:  The Photo Suite Version I got was 8.1 and they were different enough to cause confusion.

** The flash!!!!! As stated in other epinions which I wish I would have read before allowing my friend to purchase this camera, when you use the flash it is so bright that all the pictures come out so light you can't see them.  No amount of color and brightness editing can save these photos.

This means that for my specific need which is photos for auctions where you need to get up close to the item get all washed out.  You need to stand across the room but then of course the subject is too small.

*** Try deleting pictures using the camera mode.  It gets stuck constantly and the easiest way is to do it with the program.

**** I find the download a pain in the neck to use. It is more complicated than it needs to be.  It also takes up a large amount of drive space and if you don't have it you need to close down other programs and download each picture separately.

Now while I always appreciate a gift and the gesture was very nice, I feel my friend got taken for this camera.
I recommend it to no one!
