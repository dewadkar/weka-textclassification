            Hello again! During the summer I went carshopping and spotted the most sleek and elegant looking car in the lot. It was the 99' Camry. So, I took it out for a test drive, and you could barely hear the engine when it started, and when I pulled out of the parking slot, it just glided on its wheels. The steering is magnificent and so is the sound system that it is equiped with. So far I have driven nearly 6,000 miles on it, and its still driving like a dream. I really recommend this car for somebody who loves to drive a good looking car, and that has a great engine!<br><br>
