                 I own two cars, a 92 Sentra and a 99 Maxima.  From that you can tell that I know the value of owning a Nissan.  I was not the one that purchased our 92 Sentra.  My wife is the guilty party.  She owned the car before I met her.  The car was already 5 years old when we met, but still it captivated me.  

     I love the horsepower, I love the control, I love the car period.  It runs super.  Even though I love my Maxima, I still perfer to drive her old 92 Sentra.   Why you ask... because it is the best made car that I have ever ridden in, and most likely ever will ride in.  It handles better than the sports cars that I have owned.  It has enough power to keep even the most accelerated individual happy.

     The only major down side to car is one that I am learning is a down side to most any Nissan model the paint job.   Nissan seems to have issues with the quality of paint that they use.  If you don't believe me go to your nearest Nissan dealer and check out their used Nissan lineup.  You will see a tad more scratches than you would think.

     But if you are like my wife and I, you buy a car to ride in and not stare at for it's beauty.  And that is were Nissan has excelled.  They make a great ride, place a easy to swallow price on it and present it well.
