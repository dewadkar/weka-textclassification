            I would not change my Jeep for anything!  I went from a sporty little '98 Mitsubishi to my Jeep and there is nothing like a 4WD Jeep Wrangler Sport!  I bought it because I knew it would handle much better in poor weather conditions unlike my previous car.  I also found it to be roomier and fun!  I love it's compact size yet roomy interior.  I love the whole package!  I have no regrets!  
Driving it is such a rush!  I feel like a &quot;Tough, bad chick&quot;!!  What a thrill!  I think this is the perfect vehicle for someone who likes to have fun and be outdoors.  If you're into luxury, smooth riding Cadillacs then a Jeep is not for you!  But if you're all about criusin' around with the top off and the music blasting, this is the vehicle for you!  You're sure to get JEEP THRILLS!<br><br>
