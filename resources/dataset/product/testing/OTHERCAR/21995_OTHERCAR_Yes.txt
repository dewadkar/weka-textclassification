            I received this camera as a birthday present back in February.  I have used it constantly since.  I have three kids, ages 4, 2 and 10 months.  So everyone is always wanting pictures.  

I chose this camera mainly because of the 4.2 MP, and the size of it.  I also liked it because it is an HP and so is our computer and printer.  

The picture quality is wonderful, even when the kids are moving.  (Which mine constantly are.)  The color is great, even in low light.  

The only thing I wasn't 100% happy about is the small disk it came with.  When we went to the fair I used up my 13 pictures within the first hour.  (it can vary from 11 to 14 pictures on the disk, depending on the memory each picture takes).  So I ended up having to borrow someone else's camera to take the rest of the pictures because I wasn't willing to delete any.  Now I am a picture-aholic, so some people may not have this problem, but I went and got another disk with a larger capacity.  

Some people complain about the batteries in this camera.  I have had it for almost six months and changed the batteries twice.  I average about 5-7 pictures a day, including the self timer and video feature which use more battery life.  So I'd say the batteries last quite awhile.  I use the Lithium batteries, and defiently recomend them.  They aren't that much more expensive in my opinion.  

I didn't get the docking port, because since we have an HP computer all I have to do is plug it in and it automatically uploads the pictures that I took.  

I also saw some complaints about delay, the only time I have had that problem is when I accidently had it on the timer feature.  Otherwise the pics snapped almost instantly. 

My son dropped this camera on the floor (which is industrial tile) from his level (about counter top height), and the only problem we had was a slight scuff spot on it.  All features still work with no damage.  

This is the best digital camera I have used so far.
