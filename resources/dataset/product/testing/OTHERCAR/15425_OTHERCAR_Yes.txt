            When I was a child, I had two German neighbors who lived across the street.  I had always admired them for their European charms and mannerisms.  Claudete was always elegantly dressed, and Dieter was quite a gentleman.  She owned an Audi 5000 and he had a 2.0 GTI.  The later was their car of choice and never sat still long enough to gather dust on its flawless black paint.  When I was 10, I watched Dieter pull rose bushes and elm stumps from his front yard using the GTI and a tow chain.  With a wild look in his eye and the redline of the engine...earth, roots, and tire smoke filled the air.  Now as I look back, this was the wrong thing to do to the car.  But as a kid, this was the coolest thing I had ever seen.  I fell in love with VW that day.

Now I am 30 with a blooming career and money to spend on a new car.  Still having a soft spot for the little VW, I purchased one in July of 1999.  I had special ordered a 1999 GTI GLS (ever tried to insure a V6 powered car in Jersey?) draped in Futura Yellow.  I loved the car immediately as they rolled it off of the truck.  With a little prep work, I was on the road in my little yellow car, nicknamed the &quot;Spleen&quot;.  It was a hit with me and my friends.  They loved the little novelties like the blue dash lights and the interesting color.  I was more impressed with the driving manners and outright performance of the suspension.  90 degree corners are almost a possibility at 60mph.  The car does like to spin sideways under enthusiastic driving, which will turn your mother's knuckles white as she grips the silicon dampened Oh-My-Go# handles in the ceiling.  I don't drive like this normally, but you have to once in a while.  Why else would you buy a GTI?  :)

Now the problems started at my first oil change at 3000 miles.  I scheduled a visit do the dealer and dropped the car off for service.  I picked it up later on that day and drove happily towards my destination of Philadelphia.  I only got about 10 miles down the road as the warning lights and sirens went off under carefully engineered timing with the killing of the engine.  As it turns out, the car had bled to death as I left a four-inch wide spray of oil from the dealership to the point of the car's passing.  Since the car was left on the side of the road in quite possibly the worst neighborhood imaginable (Camden, NJ), I was not going to leave the car for VW or anyone else to move.  I was able to limp the car home after refilling the oil pan three times and being solicited by the local prostitutes twice.  VW was more than happy to come out THE NEXT DAY and pick up my car, resulting in another lost day of work.  So, after sitting by the phone all day I became proactive and placed a call to the service center asking when I could have my car back.  The told me it was ready.  Ready?  They had simply filled the oil pan and replaced the plug.  They assured me that the engine and mechanicals are fine and undamaged.  If so, why did the car stop running?  I had argued with the best of them from the dealership up to the regional service manager without any compensation, extension of warrantee, or satisfaction on my part.  I had asked for a new engine, and they laughed at me.  I asked for an extension of the factory coverage, and they refused.  I asked for anything at all for my inconvenience and to restore my good faith in VW, and they bid me good-day.  This process took over three months without any resolution at all.

Now to add insult to injury.  When they had the car, they removed the splash guard that protects the engine compartment and never put the bolts back in it.  After the first major snowfall in Philadelphia, I was travelling down the Interstate as the splash guard caught a lip of ice and broke off of the car, causing damage to the undercarriage as I ran over it.  VW refused to pay for the repair, stating that it was snow damage.  That was a cool $250.00.  Then, six months later, the doors on my car began to droop so badly that they wouldn't close without lifting the door's weight by the handle and forcing the door shut.  Once again, the car was taken to a different shop to have the work done.   After two failed attempts at correcting this problem, they finally got it right.  I was presented a bill for $200.00 for the work.  VW does not cover this type of work with the car's general warrantee.  So, without stating that getting satisfactory service and having VW stand behind their cars would take intervention from God himself.  I have let the little things lie because I just don't have time to play with the dealerships.  Current problems on the car:

1.  ABS will not let go of the driver's rear wheel, causing burnt brakes and horrible odor.  The car is not safe to drive at this point.  I only have 18000 miles and the car is less than 17 months old.

2.  The alarm system behaves in a random order.  It doesn't arm at one point and then spontaneously arms itself, resulting in the near cardiac arrest of an unsuspecting parking lot attendant.  This problem has been serviced by VW twice now.  The car still continues to speak it's mind.

3.  The firewall insulation was never installed properly and keeps falling into the passenger compartment.  Although my car IS yellow, the insulation that falls on my passenger's feet doesn't match.  This was corrected by the dealer just stuffing it back into place.  On the second visit, it was screwed in place using freshly drilled holes my my dashboard.  It has not dropped since.

If it weren't for the fact that I really love this car, I would trade it in for a less problematic GM product (yes, that's a joke).  The car is really put together well, no rattles or bangs, and rides like a dream.  I use this car for commuting and a few spirited canyon runs whenever I get the chance.  I will recommend this car wholeheartedly to anyone looking for a small car with personality, that doesn't skimp on the fun factor.  If VW could turn their service around and make people happy instead of frustrated to the point of tears or physical violence.  It makes me proud to both drive and own this car.  After all, your peers just see the car, not the service nightmare behind it.
