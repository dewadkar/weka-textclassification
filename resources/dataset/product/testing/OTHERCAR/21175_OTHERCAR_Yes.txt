            You may well find one of these vehicles in your local used car lot, and in a dizzying array of configurations.  They were manufactured as regular cabs and extended cabs, short wheel base and long wheel base, flareside and step bed.  There were three engine variants available in the half ton, the 4.3L, the 5.0L and the 5.8L.  The &quot;K&quot; code is the four wheel drive variant of the Chevrolet pick-up.  You could get a fancy push button actuated transfer case, or the old fashioned shift lever on the floor.  Believe it or not, you could also get this truck with a manual gearbox.  

I was exposed to this truck by virtue of being neighbors with a guy who owns one.  His wife and daughter drove it to Tampa for the State Horse Show, where they experienced a mechanical failure.  The repairs were extensive enough to require stranding the vehicle in a Tampa auto shop and them having to get a ride back with friends.  I was in the area the next week, so I offered to pick up the repaired pick-up (no pun?).  I used it over the weekend and drove it the 450 miles back to Fort Walton Beach, FL.  I came away with some distinct impressions of the truck, and I felt this forum correct for revealing them.       

There is no shortage of these ubiquitous pick-ups, so if you're giving one a look, here are some things to consider:

<b>Features:</b>  If I were betting the farm, I would say the majority of these trucks manufactured in 1996 were the extended cab version.  I have seen a few in regular cab, short wheel base, but not too many.  By 1996 the marketers had figured out that most people were hauling more groceries than sawed logs in their K1500s.  The truck is still wholly a truck, but with creature comforts that were non-existent 20 years ago.  20 years ago you were lucky to get an AM radio in a pick-up, much less captain's chairs and map lights.  They are even more cush now, offering leather upholstery, heated seats and GPS navigation.  I digress.  The vehicle is a four wheel drive, ladder frame, rear wheel main drive, longitudinally mounted engined truck with myriad body styles, wheel bases and bed configurations.  The truck I drove was a short step bed extended cab five speed (that's right!) with the 5.8L V-8.  

<b>Interior:</b>  The interior was beige cloth with captain's chairs.  The fabric was of good quality, but not as rugged as it could be.  There is a capacious center console with lids and sub-lids that flip outwards, supposedly for writing on or other such nonsense.  There are multiple 12 volt outlets for plugging in various devices.  One annoyance is the tendency of a vacant passenger captain's chair to wiggle about seductively in the absence of a passenger's weight to hold it down.  The dash board and door panels are plastic, and cheap looking plastic at that.  The gauges are laid out in an easy to read array, the tachometer left, the speedometer center, and the Four Gauges of the Apocalypse (gas, coolant temp, oil pressure, voltmeter) stacked neatly on the right.  The back seat is a bench.  Picture a bench, that is the back seat.  Now, before you compel anyone to ride back there for any period of time more than 30 minutes, picture a bench.  The air conditioner in my sample truck would chill the cabin down to arctic temperatures.  This truck features the old shift handle four wheel drive lever, right there next to the transmission shift handle.  One item of note on the interior is that the door panel's map pockets are big enough to swallow a 12 oz. Coke can... amazing.  

<b>Mechanicals:</b>  The 5.8L V-8 is not a new design.  Its pushrod technology can be traced back to the 1960s.  This does not mean that it is not a good engine.  Paired with a modern, throttle body fuel injection induction system and state of the art electronic ignition and computer controlled fuel and spark modulation, this engine can run with the best of them.  It cranks out 255 HP, and you need it, considering the curb weight of this truck (in the vicinity of two and a half tons).  The four wheel drive system is of the old part time variety, only meant for use on slippery surfaces (unlike the Torque on Demand and full time systems we see so much nowadays on Sport Utes).  This four wheel drive system is for off road and snow/ice use only.  The five speed gearbox is a New Venture Gear 3500, a joint venture between Chrysler and GM (lawdy!), its shifting and gear points seemed very well matched to the 3.42 ratio differential and the 5.8L V-8.  The front differential is static mounted between the frame rails, driving axles through A-arms and coil spring front suspension.  No locking hubs or manual locking hubs are needed, the front end componentry is always spinning, apparently light enough not to effect fuel economy.  

<b>Perfomance:</b>  The 5.8 and the five speed gear box give you what you need to move a vehicle this size around in traffic.  The engine and driveline are set up very well for interstate travel.  The truck I drove liked doing 80 mph, and all the while only spinning 2400 rpm.  I'm certain this truck could be driven much faster, but I find no reason to exceed 80 mph (beer cans start flying out of the bed at 82 mph).  The clutch was smooth and predictable.  The brakes performed very well, but with a vehicle of this weight, I would inspect the brakes at each tire rotation.  Highway ride is good, with some bounding associated with the leaf spring suspended rear end.  Off road and four wheel drive traction are very good, but could be better with a more reasonable final drive ratio.  The truck is sold and marketed to people who will never use them off road, so the emphasis is on highway use.  The componentry, however, is plenty rugged for light to medium off roading.  The true limiting factor in off road performance is the wheel base and overhang.  This truck is huge by Toyota and Jeep standards, and when fording depressions, you have to be certain you're not going to hang a bumper fore or aft.  If you are running sandy trails or snow covered terrain, you're covered.  Just remember to use four low when things get tight.  

<b>Fuel Economy:</b>  Considering the weight and duty description of this truck, it does fairly well, around 13 city, 17 or 18 highway.  The truck features a 30 or so gallon fuel tank, and you'll need it!

<b>Reliability:</b>  If I said these were the most reliable trucks on the road, I would be like a politician.  The particular truck that I drove had problems with the in-tank fuel pump, the fuel pressure regulator and a couple of fuel injectors, all to the tune of about $800.  The interior of the vehicle had problems with the seat tracks, a particularly bothersome problem if you happen to be riding in one of these seats when it decides to slide from front detent to back each time the brake or accelerator is depressed.  Do it yourself work is possible, but not without a well equipped shop.  On Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) may limit your attempts at self maintenance.  

<b>Bottom Line:</b>  If you are dealing for one of these trucks, the market is on your side.  There is an abundance of them out there.  If you can't seem to strike a deal on the first one, look around a little for another one.  Above all, get a good price.  They are certainly a competent pick-up that is up to the task of your heaviest hauling and towing needs.  You may need to budget reliability into your finances, because you can be sure that it will cost you some money each year that you operate it for routine maintenance and repairs.  A good selling price can help mitigate some of the financial strain and get you into a really big, really tough pick-up that scores well on the looks and performance scales.                     <br><br>
