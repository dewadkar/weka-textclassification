            My overall experience with the Staurn SL has been a positive one after having driven it for one year and about 20,000 miles. 

I decided to go for a Saturn primarily because I wanted to avoid any car dealer hassles, and the Saturn dealership proved to be great. (Though the Hurrahs and the customary photo, once the deal was done, were slightly embarrassing).

Being a student the car had to meet certain criteria; it had to be cheap, have room in the back (since it would serve as my mobile home), be miserly with the gas and not leave me stranded in the snow in good old Rochester. The Saturn has been good on all counts and has never given me any trouble whatsoever. It has a smooth ride and is actually pretty well mannered in the snow, because of its front wheel drive configuration and narrow all weather tires. (Which by the way are Firestones!)

The interior is no frills. A simple dash with large readable Tach and Speedo, intuitive radio and temperature controls and well placed pedals with good leg room for small and medium sized drivers. My 5' 8'' height is ideal for the car but larger drivers will have a snug fit.   

Performance wise the car is no great shakes, but if you're looking for a fast machine, Saturn should be the last car company you should be thinking of. Having said that, the car has plenty of oomph for highway passing and on my numerous trips to Boston I can't thing of a single instance where the car left me wanting a few more horses to complete an overtaking maneuver. Oh! and I can certify that it goes upto a 109 mph before the speed governor kicks in and brings you back to sanity. 

Now for my dislikes. 
First and foremost is Saturn's manual transmission. Having driven stick shifts all my life, I've had experience with good and bad ones, this one would rank among my least favorites. Its clunky, the shift gates are not well defined and in general the transmission doesn't like to be hurried especially when its cold. I've driven far cheaper cars with silky smooth shifters so the price tag cannot be considered a valid excuse. 

The other problem, but not a major one, is the fit and finish of the car. My left rear door required a lot of effort to open from day 1 and Saturn despite their best intentions have not been able to fix the problem. Also on some less than ideal roads the dashboard makes various buzzing sounds, though these are audible on most roads.

To sum it up, if you're looking for cheap, reliable transportation, Saturn should be right up there on your list, just make sure its an automatic and not a manual.
