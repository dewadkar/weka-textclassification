            After owning a Ford &amp; a Toyota, I am now a real Chevrolet enthusiast.  I own the 1999 Chevrolet Venture.  It is my third Chevrolet vehicle.  These autos are made to last.  Previously, I had a Blazer &amp; would still have it had I not needed a bigger family car.  The van, and my husband's truck, never gave me a moments problem.  It answers everything I every wanted.  The Venture looks great, has a smooth ride, carries everybody, &amp; runs beautifully.

I now have 2 children, both of which, are in car seats.  The van takes them, their toys, stroller, &amp; other necessities without any effort.  In fact, it is so roomy that I can fit all this &amp; still have space for groceries and whatever else I need to carry.  

When you ride in this luxurious vehicle you would never know it was a van.  The extended wheel base &amp; super shocks make you feel that you are riding on air.  When my husband drives I am able to read and write without any difficulty.  

The Venture has a polished, neat exterior.  Its sleek design would make anyone feel that they are riding in &quot;style.&quot; This van also did very well on the government offset crash tests.  I would recommend the Chevrolet Venture to anyone.  <br><br>
