            As I approach your car from behind, you chuckle.  You look out at me in your mirror, and realize that getting away from me may not be as easy as you think (4 wheel drive, 6 V).  You rev your engine, and I rev mine ... and the light turns green.  As I pass your 2000 Corvette, you see I have a slight smirk on my face.

Am I dreaming, yes, but I do love my blazer.  Being my first, and current car, this 92 Blazer and I took driving classes, and got me through my test.  Needless to say we have developed a close bond.

<b>So, what does this BEAST of a car look like?</b>

As you pull up behind my Blaze (as I call it), you can't help but see the PHISH sticker starring at you from my back windshield.  My car looks like the picture above, but a maroon color.  After 8 years this cars paint job is still satisfactory.  The interior is black and maroon with black carpet and dash.

<b>How about the Features?</b>

My Blazer is relatively loaded with:

-Air
-Power-steering
-AM/FM Cassette (replaced with a Jensen CD player and subwoofer :)
-Power windows 
-Power locks
-Rear wiper and defrost

<b>It's old ... how's it holding up?</b>
At 120,000 miles, it still purrs like a kitten.  It starts the first time every time and runs perfect for the low grade gas I feed it.  It still gets up there in speed (had it up to 85 mph... don't tell my parents :) and handles less like a Blazer and more like a nice big car.  Even difficult maneuverability is made simple.

<b>Gas Miles</b>

I get about 17 mpg in the city and around 20 on the freeway.

<b>Over-all</b>

Having had this car for almost a year, aside from oil changes, NOTHING has had to be done.  A great car.
