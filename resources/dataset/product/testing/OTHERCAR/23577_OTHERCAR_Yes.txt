            I've had my Leuxs IS300 for about a year and a half and I've put about 30,000 miles on it already.  I've always been into cars and the first thing that caught my eye was the racing style of the car with the clear Euro backlights and 17-inch rims.  After doing some research on it, I traded in my Saturn 3door coupe for the IS300.  The asking price for the car was $34,000, and with the complete package it came to about $38,000.  I got $7,000 for my trade-in and managed to talk the car salesman to reduce the price another $2000 (it was NOT easy.)  So in total, my final price was around $29,000.  The people at the dealership were very professional and friendly.  I didn't feel pressured at all to buy anything.  The first time I went to just look and they were there to answer questions and offer their help.  Here is my opinion overall so far with the car.

<b>Interior</b>
The car isn't compact, but it doesn't have a lot of space to move around in.  There are two interior color options to choose from, beige and black.  The beige color didn't look so hot, so I chose black.  The bucket seats are leather trimmed with escanine cloth.  While comfortable at first, the seats tend to hurt my bottom after a couple of hours.  I don't think it would be very comfortable on a long trip.  They are easy to adjust though, with the power buttons located on the side, which is convienent.  The gauges are a chonograph racing style, which is hard to read at first.  The dashboard is a hard black plastic and for $30,000 car, seems out of place and cheap.  The cupholders are tiny and fit about two cans of soda, and are also made out of the same cheap plastic.  The shifter is a shiny chrome ball, which is nice.  The backseat does not fold down, and trunk space is average.  Overall, the interior of the car doesn't resemble anything you would expect from a Lexus.

<b>Exterior</b>
The exterior styling of the car is what catches most people's eye.  The car was made with a younger age group in mind.  The car comes in a variety of colors, some which are unique and you don't see on many cars.  The IS300 comes with 17 inch low-profile tires and clear backlights.  The car is aggressive looking with its sharp lines and angles.  You can tell at first glance that the car is small inside.  The design isn't very original though, you can find the same style in a Volkswagon model.

<b>Handling</b>
The IS300 handles very well around corners.  It turns sharp and you can feel it hugging the curves.  Even at higher speeds, the car still feels tight.  I would say that it starts to lose its tightness around 120-130.  (Don't worry I don't drive that fast all the time.)  The car seems to wobble a little at this speed and lose control.  Other than that, the handling is great.
The car comes with automatic and E-shift, where you use buttons on the steering wheel to shift up and down.  Handling in automatic is fine, I haven't used the E-shift so I can't tell you anything about that.  

<b>Acceleration & Power</b>
The IS300 is a v6 with 215 hp.  It goes 0-60 in about 7 seconds, which isn't bad.  I found when I first started driving that the car tended to jerk forward when I hit the gas pedal, but it stopped now.  The acceleration is smooth and quick, and the engine makes a nice throaty noise when the pedal is floored.  Even at higher speeds, the car is quick to pick up speed.  The car has more than enough power for everyday use and for my bad, aggressive driving.  I find that the power of this car has gotten me into a lot of trouble.  I've been pulled over 4 time already in this car.  With the car being so eye-catching, I find that cops spot it out easier.  I think cops are more suspicious of seeing a 21 year old girl driving a Lexus then they are of me speeding and testing the power of the car.  The power and quick acceleration of the car make it fun to drive, and it's definately one of the best things about the IS300.

<b>Traction & Brakes</b>
The traction on the car is good, and so are the brakes.  The tires seem to grip the road.  There is a traction control button in the car, which you can switch on and off.  There is also a traction option for when driving in snow, which I haven't used since it doesn't snow here in Florida.  With the traction control on though, if you begin to spin out, less power is given to the wheels so it remains in control.  This has been very useful for when I turn corners too quick.  The brakes are very sturdy and work great.  I've definately avoided crashing into some things because of these brakes.

<b>Ride</b>
The ride is considerably smooth, and it is dead silent in the car when driving at a slow or moderate speed.  Once you get on a highway though, you can start to hear the rush of wind and it can become quite noisy.  Overall, it is smooth but not as smooth as you would find in other luxury cars.  The car doesn't seem to fare too well over big bumps and potholes though, they seem to hit hard on the suspension.

<b>Safety</b>
The car feels solid and has done well in car crash tests, but I have some concern with the airbags.  I had a car accident where I crashed head on into a palm tree at around 50mph, and the airbag did not deploy.  Keep in mind, my car took out the whole entire palm tree out of the ground and also managed to move over the truck it was next to, but the airbag did not come out at all.  The car will definately hold up in an accident; even with my huge crash the front end was crushed in and that's all.  I doubt some people will be as lucky as I was in an accident, and the airbag is definately an area of concern.  The car is sturdy and strong though, it will hold up through a minor accident and some bangs.

<b>Gas Mileage</b>
I find that my car eats gas.  I don't take long trips, but I find myself filling the gas tank at least once a week, if not twice.  Even going to the grocery store and back, the gas meter will drop notches.  I have to say that this seemed to happen after I got into my accident, so it is probably linked with that.  The IS300 overall though does seem to take in more gas than other cars, and it requires you put in premium gas.

<b>Service Costs</b>
Taking the IS300 in for service is expensive.  They ask you to come in every 5,000 miles.  While taking my Saturn only cost me $60, I find myself paying around $200 each time I go to get my IS300 serviced.  After my accident, my check engine light has come on twice, which they fixed for free, but came on again a day later and has been on since then.  They do a close check of the car though, but the costs seem incredibly high.

<b>Overall</b>
The Lexus IS300 is a very good car overall, but not worth the $34,000 they are asking for it.  It is a gorgeous car and very eye catching, but the interior is lacking. It's fun to drive and handles great.  The airbag is also a safety concern.  Overall, even though it lacks some things, I would recommend this car.
