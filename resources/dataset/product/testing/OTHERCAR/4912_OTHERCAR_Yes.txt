                 THE CAMERA PRODUCES A VERY CLEAR PICTURE.. I HAVE HAD A 640X480 SONY MAVICA, A 1.3 MEGA PIXEL SONY MAVICA, AND NOW THIS.. I HAVE WALKED THROUGH THE EVOLUTION OF PIXELS AND THIS NOW IS VERY VERY CLEAR... I AM ABLE TO PRINT AN 8X10 YES FULL 8 X 10 PICTURE AND FRAME IT AND NO ONE CAN TELL....

     I HAVE BEEN PLAYING WITH MY P-1 FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS AND HAVE OUT PUT SOME WHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 1,000 PICTURES, AND IT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO. 

I FIND THAT THE NEW "AE" BUTTON IS USEFUL FOR GETTING DARK OR NIGHT TIME SHOTS BUT IS BEST WHEN YOU USE A TRIPOD AND SET THE TIMER SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH THE CAMERA TO TAKE THE PICTURE... 

MICRO WORKS WELL BUT YOU MUST NOT GET TOO CLOSE OR IT BLURS THE IMAGE SIZE IS SO LARGE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE MICRO IS NOT SO MICRO BUT IT TAKES VERY CLEAR MICRO PICTURES.

THE TRIGGER BUTTON SHOULDN'T BE TO HARD TO LEARN BUT IT'S NOT JUST POINT AND SHOOT.  IT MUST BE DEPRESSED SLIGHTLY TO FOCUS THEN IT TAKES.  IF IT DID NOT FOCUS IT WOULD BE POINT AND SHOOT, BUT WHO WANTS BLURED PICTURES.. IF YOU TAKE ALLOT OF ACTION SHOTS KEEP THE TRIGGER DEPRESSED FOR A FEW SECONDS BEFORE SHOOTING

     THE 8 MB MEMORY STICK IT COMES WITH IS LIKE A FREE SAMPLE IT ONLY HOLDS 6 PICTURES AT HIGH RES... I BOUGHT A 64MB STICK AND IT COMES OUT TO 48 PICTURES AT THE HIGHEST RES. OR ABOUT 114 PICTURES AT 1280 X 960

     THE BATTERY IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE IT LASTS 70+ MINUTES BUT A SECOND BATTERY IS NICE FOR AN ALL DAYER
