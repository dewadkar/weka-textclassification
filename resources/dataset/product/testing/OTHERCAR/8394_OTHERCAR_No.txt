            Cool lines, a sporty stance, fun to drive . . . when it drives.

In terms of out-of-the factory suspension, the Chrysler Sebring is tough to beat.  The ride is smooth and the handling is tight; bumps seem insubstantial and body roll is minimal.  Acceleration with the V6 is grin-prompting and, damn, the car looks good.  Especially the sexy convertible.

The seats are comfortable, the sound system is good, and I like the interior appearance, although some do not.  The front-seat passengers have adequate legroom, though the back seat is cramped -- but then, the car is a coupe.  You're not gonna buy it to haul around Junior.

But then there's the reliability issue.  The car typifies what has become Classic Chrysler -- it breaks A LOT.

The alternator blows up.  The alignment won't stay aligned.  The automatic transmission slips out of gear.  The engine knocks at high RPMs.  Something keeps fouling the spark plugs.  Granted, I drive a lot,  but all of these problems before 25,000 miles is ridiculous.

Anyone want to buy a car?  Going cheap!
