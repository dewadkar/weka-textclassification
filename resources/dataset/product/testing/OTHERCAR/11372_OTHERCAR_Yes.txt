            I have enjoyed owning my Grand Caravan for over a year. It is a great family car, with plenty of room for long or short trips. I drive the vehicle about 40 miles a day and think it handles great in all kinds of weather. I priced the vehicle with other Mini Vans and found this one to be the most value for the money. I love it. It has been a very good family investment for a safe and enjoyable ride. A friend of ours has one too. We use them both on weekends to transport our soccer team to the match. The parent's follow later at their leisure. The kids love their team buses!<br><br>
