            I purchased my '90 Mazda MX-6 GT Turbo from a family member and have been pleased with the car on the whole. It came with all options except for the four wheel steering and anti lock brakes. I am pleased with the overall ride of the car.  I am especially happy about the ride on the hiway.  it runs smooth and handles very well. on the down side it soes not make for a good car driving around town. the turbo makes for not very smooth accelerations.  many of the in town speed limits are right inbetween gears which means you are either underpowered or over powered. as far as accereation goes the turbo is great and the car will get you uup to speed very well.  The car has much space for its size and with the adjustable suspension does not squat even when loaded down.  If you were looking for a car to drive around town thisis not the one.  If you are looking for a great hiway car this is definately it.  It loves to go. it is hard to keep it under 80 mph it loves it at about 90 or 100 and still has alot left after that!<br><br>
