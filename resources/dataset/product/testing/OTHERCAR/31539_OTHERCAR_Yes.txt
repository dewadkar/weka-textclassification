            I like this camera.  The menu commands are a little bit tricky if you don't read the manual but I think that all digital cameras are.  I like that I can adjust the image resolution before I take the pictures.  I like the 3x optical zoom, but what I really like is the fact that I never have to buy AA batteries, and no separate charger is required.  The camera itself recharges the batteries.

I also found the print quality acceptable.  And that's saying a lot for a digital.  Even the best digicam I have seen doesn't compare to my old 35mm camera for picture quality.  But as digis go, this one's pretty good.<br><br>
