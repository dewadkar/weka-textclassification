            When shopping for a new car to replace my 1995 Pathfinder, I decided to look at used Q45s and Audi A4s.  I hadn't even seen the S80s yet, but the Volvo dealer was just up the street from the Audi dealer.  When we couldn't get anyone to even talk to us at the Audi dealership we thought we'd check out Volvo.  I fell in love when I saw the S80.  

I love the unique look of the car both outside and inside.  I love all of the features also.  I did have a few issues when I first bought the car, which I hear happen a lot with the first year of a new model.  I did have to take it in twice to fix a loud crunching noise when I turned left (which by the way took about 3 months to get fixed because it was a defective part and the tool required to fix it was on back order with Volvo), and the lock for the glove compartment just fell out.  After the first 6 months though I haven't had any problems.  

The only thing I hate is when I take it in to the dealer they give me the T6 to drive for the day.  Next time I want the T6!  There is a big hesitation with power but once you get it going the ride is nice and smooth.

I've had many comments on my car on the looks and how comfortable it is to ride in.  I feel there is plenty of room even in the back seat.
