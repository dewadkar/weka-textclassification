            This camera is the best electronic I have ever bought.
The second I received the package from the mail I haven�t put it down. Yea it take smiley 2 hours for the first charge but after that each charge goes by in what seems like 5 minutes but really less then 30. Speaking of buying this camera. I got this camera for just under 1000 dollars. No I m not connected to the mob. It is called ebay. If you are reading this review, you have enough sense to check ebay. So I got the camera in perfect condition never opened with the warranty brand new for 975 including shipping. 

Now about the actual camera. I would like to consider my self a good not professional photographer. I do indeed work for a professional photographer but I m not one myself. This camera is so easy to use. My father, a 55 year old who can just barely send an email can use this camera with ease. It is tricky at first but after that it really gets easy. The little keypad for directional use on the LCD screen is a pain in the u knows where. But you get the hang of it. It does take time. Almost 1000 pictures for me. Speaking of 1000 pictures that is the capacity for just one disk. Think about that for a second. You can buy a disk for 5 dollars.... that is all it cost for 1000 pictures. Add up the price for a regular 35mm camera. 5 for a roll of film and 10 for developing and printing. But there you only get 30 pictures. Well if u does your math correctly it would take a lot of money to take 1000 pictures and get them developed the old way!

What I have told you u should be enough but if you are still shaky don�t be. The camera has something called steady shot. When you take a picture the camera can move a little bit. This is a problem. But the Sony mavica takes away the blurriness of this problem and fixes it automatically! This is a great feature. Another great feature on this camera is the zoom lenses. You can�t really appreciate it unless you are actually holding the camera in your hands. And when I say holding it in your hands I do mean with a plural s! This camera is huge. It is definitely not for the tourist. If you r a tourist buys the Nikon cool pix 990 an excellent camera. But that camera doesn�t have the zoom the mavica has. 

The mavica cd-1000 burns directly to a cd. Hence the cd part of the name. When you burn to a cd u don�t compromise and pixels or definition of the picture. With a flash card or a floppy disk you can really loose resolution. If you are just dad taking picture of your kids then who cares this inst for you. But what ever floats your boat. 

One of my favorite things I can do with this camera is take it on trials and when I get home I can show it to everyone. As soon as I get home I plug the camera right into the VCR and play back a slide show that is built into the camera right onto my TV! This saves me a lot of trouble. Now I can drink hot chocolate instead of answer everyone�s questions about what I saw and how much fun my snow shoeing expedition was!!!

Well I have tog o but read other peoples opinions. This is a big investment make the right decision. If I were you go to a store and look at it before u buy!!!
