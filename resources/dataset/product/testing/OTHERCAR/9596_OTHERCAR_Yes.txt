            I purchased my Celica in October 99 and it's one of the best purchases I've made.  The car drives like a dream and is an eye catcher.  My recommendation to buyers: Don't get black! I leased a black Celica and it's impossible to keep clean and if you get a scratch-well let's just say you can see it from across a parking lot. Let's not even think about dents.....
I test drove both the GT and the GTS version.  I opted for a fully loaded GT for three reasons: First the GTS has a really loud engine. You have no problem feeling the automatic transmission shift.  The 7000 RPM kick is awesome to feel but I couldn't get past the noise factor. Second, and I'm not sure why, but the GTS model feels alot heavier then the GT.  Both versions have the same engine, except the GTS has been tweaked to perform with 40 more horsepower.  The third and final reason was price.  I couldn't see paying about $4000 more for 40 more horsepower, leather seats, racing pedals(what's the point?), leather wrapped steering wheel(which I thought was ugly) and a few more buttons on the radio. I like my Celica GT.  It's awesome to drive and I recommend it to anyone. <br><br>
