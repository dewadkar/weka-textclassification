            We bought our 98 Camry LE just about a month ago, it was used and we needed a second car.  We also have a 2000 Neon, which I will compare the Camry to.  The Camry is like heaven to me.  I can recline my seat with the carseat behind me, stretch out my legs and enjoy the smooth ride.  I would highly recommend this as a family car, with plenty of room in both the front and back seats, plus an extremely roomy trunk.  In my Neon I have to jam the carseat in, and ease the stroller into the trunk.  In the Camry it's so much easier.  It's just a toss and a slide.  The baby falls to sleep immediately to the smooth ride.  Plus, with the certification of your used Toyota you get a warranty which covers 100,000 miles, which I need due to many road trips.  It is a beautiful vehicle.  I would buy a second one.  We cant' wait to trade in our Neon for another Toyota and we decided that we will never buy anything but Toyota again.
