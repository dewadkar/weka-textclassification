            I bought this car in 1991 and it's still running!  It hasn't been taken it to the shop yet (knock on wood) and it's still running like a dream!  It could be that it was my first car (I gave it to my parents) and we took good care of it, like not screeching the brakes, etc.  I don't know.  

It's a great little car that can hold a lot of stuff with the back seats folded down.  I am sometimes amazed at how much stuff I can hold in that car!  I could go to Home Depot and get lumber, and other bulky stuff and still am able to take them home no problem.  Of course, I have to carefully figure out how to optimze my space and still be able to drive but it's great!  I found that there was plenty of leg room for the back seat passengers (compared to other small cars, especially the Volkswagon Rabbit or the new Beetle).  I'm quite a short person and I found that my legs were crammed when I sat in the backseat of the new Beetle and the Rabbit!  

The car can hold 5 people (including the driver).  I find that five people can fit quite comfortably in it without much problem.  I got mine with automatic transmission and power steering and brakes. Mine was a two door hatchback and unfortunately in Canada, it's no longer available.  I was told that they were discontinued in 1995.  I guess I'll have to go down south to get it then.

I got just the basic, bare bones edition new.  I had to make a deal with the dealer to have a right side mirror because it didn't come with it.  The car is a two door hatchback.  I'm not sure if it comes in 4 doors.  The bare bones edition did not include a car clock, AM/FM radio with cassette, hanging hooks, and others.  I couldn't justify paying a lot of money for some of these.  I paid extra for the AM/FM radio with cassette and specified the one to be installed.  I wanted what I wanted rather than getting a crappy stereo that most times is installed on cars and regretting it.  The car has a rear wiper that can spray washer fluid, which is very nice feature to have, and found in most hatchback cars.  It also has a rear defog/defrost lines to clear off the rear window.  Like most cars, it comes with a glove compartment, and a small area under the stereo for storage of small objects.  And, being bare bones, there is no cup holders.  Darn.  The driver and passenger seats are bucket seats and all seats are made of plastic with an almost zig zag cut pattern all along the seat to allow the seat to conform and stretch to the pressure of its passenger.  The back seats can easily be flapped down for storage of bulky items and snapped back into place without much difficulty.  There are buttons on the both sides of the car that will lock or unlock the backseats for folding.

My only problem with the car was that it didn't have that much power.  Uphill driving shows the lack of power in the 323 but I usually release the Overdrive button located on the transmission to get an extra kick.  That drops the gear back one and I get a lot more power to reach the speed I wanted.  But then, it's just a little economy car, so I really can't complain.<br><br>
