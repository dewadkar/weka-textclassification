            The Exilim is incredibly small and cute. The LCD is very sharp and people will marvel at its size where ever you go. Taking pictures is the simplest I've seen of all digital cameras. The camera powers on in less than 1 second, compared to 4-5 seconds on my HP 315 camera. To review pictures, slide a control from "REC" to "PLAY" and your pictures appear instantaneously. My HP 315 again takes 5-6 seconds to show pictures stored on the camera. 

The camera's serious weakness is the picture quality. In short, the camera takes horrible pictures. The colors the camera captures are not accurate. Pictures often turn out tinted blue or yellow. Also the flash is so weak that the background is too dark and filled with noise. By noise I mean the background is speckled green and red. The worst is in taking pictures outside. Pictures were always too bright. I tried taking a picture of someone outside, and their face just appeared as flash of light. On every shot, the exilim took far worse pictures than my 3 year old HP 315. I bought it online and returned it within a week. 

Don't trust websites that show "pictures taken with the Exilim." They are often taken under ideal lighting conditions. Even after taking a picture, the picture looks great on the LCD. Once you see it on a computer, then you'll notice all the defects.
