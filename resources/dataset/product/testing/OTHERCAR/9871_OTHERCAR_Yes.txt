            After testing driving 4 times I decided to buy an SR5 with the options I want.  This is a first SUV that I've owned, though I've test driven many other SUVs.  I picked this truck because of the cargo/passenger capacity, towing capacity that suits my need to tow a sail boat, ride quality, safety features, such as side airbags and stability control, and for Toyota's reliability.  

I've not been disappointed much except for the performance of the AC system and a couple of small things.  If there is any improvement to be made, I'd like to see better interior lighting, less steering sensitivity, heated seats for leather seating option in an SR5.

As for the AC, mine seems to have a problem of underperformance compared to at least another Sequoia.  The dealer insists that my AC is working normally but comments that the AC system in the Sequoia is inadequate for the size of the vehicle.

Another annoyance that my Sequoia has is the tapping noise when the outside temperature is cold, i.e. below 64 degrees F.  The engine would sound like a diesel engine until it is fully warmed up.  Many people have reported the same problem but so far there is no fix from Toyota.

If you wish to read other owners' comments on their Sequoia, visite Edmunds.com's SUV forum, and look for the Sequoia.  Or visit tundrasolutions.com and look for sequoia solutions under the forum menu.

By the way, the best gas mileage I can get so far is about 15 mpg.  My driving is a mix of city and some highway driving.  My Sequoia is 4 months old and only has about 1,800 miles on it.  Maybe the gas mileage will improve as the engine is fully broken in.

UPDATE:

After owning the Sequoia for a year and a half, we've put on only a little over 11K miles.  In general, we still love it.  Gas mileage for highway with  passengers, dogs, luggage, and a rooftop box ranges between 17-19 in 4x4 mode.  It has gotten 20 mpg hwy driving with a much lighter load.  Around town, it gets 12-14 mpg. Thanks goodness that it only needs regular gas.

Having been with the truck for a while, I find that the driver seat does not give adequate back support for long trips, even with the lumbar support in its firmest setting.  I have to put a map book behind my lumbar area to firm up the lower back support.  The Volvos we've owned have much better driver seat support.

Over all, the truck has been performing mostly flawlessly.  There is an occasional squeaking noise in the dash area and in the rear gate when going over bumps.  The squeaky noise in the rear gate was fixed by the dealer by applying a lubricant to the right places.

Happily, the AC problem is now a thing of the past.  Thanks to some smart Sequoia owners on Edmund's Sequoia forum who showed me how to adjust a valve in the heating/AC system.  The dealer had no clue on how to fix it.  Their response was that the AC system is working fine.

Some owners mention about the poor visibility in the rear, etc.  It's true. The blind spot on the right side seems disconcerting at first.  In my opinion, it just takes time  to get used to for a truck that size.  I'm fine with it now.

In spite of all the drawbacks that we've pointed out above, my wife and I still think that it's a great truck.

UPDATE:  This truck handles very well in deep snow (12-15 inches).  Northern VA was blessed with lots of snow last winter.  The Sequoia performed very well in 4x4.  Traction control, ABS, and stability control worked overtime to compensate for my inexperience with driving a truck.
