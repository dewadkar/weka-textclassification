            Recently my wife and I retired.  An inventory of our vehicles confirmed we had too much money tied up in motor vehicles.  We sold everything including our '98 Volvo S70. We got a low mileage 4x4 Ranger to get around in any kind of leather.  We also needed a smaller, reasonably priced vehicle that had excellent handling and good repair record. As we have had excellent success with Ford vehicles we drove several including the new 2000 Sable.  But we weren't sold on anything until we drove a new 2000 Mystique.  It embodied all of the attributes we needed.  The dealer was good enough to allow us to take it home and look it over carefully.  We were sold but it didn't have ABS and the dealer couldn't obtain one so we turned it back in.  We also had learned the Mystique would be discontinued and we were concerned about accelerated depreciation.

But we began to realize we wouldn't really be satisfied unless we got one, so we queried a number of dealers to see what was available.  We happened to find a fully equipped 1999 model with 17K, checked it out and bought it.  Got a terrific deal that removed the depreciation concern.

My wife loves this car.  It looks sharp and that spoiler sets it off.  The comfort and responsiveness are first rate and the engine will run rings around my Volvo.  In fact it seems to have as much power as my Saab Turbo without the crankiness.  On a recent trip the seats proved exceptionally comfortable even for someone like myself as I am 6'6&quot;.  The power and responsiveness are much appreciated in traffic and climbing steep hills. The three hour trip on a crowded interstate was effortless. We feel very comfortable taking this car on a long road vacation. Also, the trunk is huge; much larger than our Volvo.

One thing we are going to have to have repaired is the dash. For some reason there are bubbles in the vinyl and will require replacement of the dash.  We hope to get it back without any added squeaks but at least it shouldn't cost us anything since it is under warranty.

We have been informed that Ford decided to drop the Mystique/Contour because it doesn't make them any money.  It actually costs more to manufacture and sell than they get back in profits.  We have also been told that it has the best repair record of any vehicle in Ford's stable.  All-in-all, we are very pleased with this vehicle and highly recommend it especially if you can find a nearly new one as we did and save on that first year's depreciation.  We fully expect to have this car for many years.

5/9/00  This is an update of my previous review.  We have just turned 24,000 miles and have come off of a 3,200 mile trip.  The car was bullet proof throughout. It also feels &quot;substantial&quot; and is not some cheap econobox.  Was comfortable and I am 6'6&quot; and 240 pounds.  The V6 engine pulls like a freight train and the vehicle handles exceptionally well.  Very little to complain about except two squeaks in the dash.  As stated above, the dash had to be replaced under warranty and these squeaks were also left behind.  I will have to get that fixed.  

If I would change anything it would be to add automatic light turn offs and the unlocking by key would unlock all doors instead of the one door.  

Be sure to get the leather upholstery and the sun roof.  Well worth the expenditure.  Has tremendous trunk capacity and the fuel mileage was about 29-30 overall on the trip.  Quite acceptable.

All-in-all, we are quite pleased.  Although the Contique is being phased out, take advantage of the depreciation to save a barrel of money.  Drive it for 100K and see what is available then.  Don't believe you will be disappointed.<br><br>
