             Jan 2004 UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My car has about 108,000 miles and I had to replace a thermostat about two months ago.  No big deal.  While I was there though I noticed the radiator leaking from the top plastic tank to where it mounts to the metal tank.  It needs a new radiator.  They are almost $300 from Honda, not installed.  I will probably go to performance radiator and get a rebuilt one for around $130.

This is a little update to my review from a couple years 
ago.  It is now Feb 2003.  My Honda has 102,000 miles on it.  I have just replaced the timing belt and timing balancer belt about a month ago.  I did it myself so I didn't pay the $600 they wanted at the dealership.  The timing belts were supposed to be replaced at 90,000 miles but I got lazy.

Now to the important stuff.  I really haven't had any major problems with the car.  I haven't had it in to a repair place for anything.  I have done all the maintenance on the vehicle. 

 I had to replace the battery at about 71,000.  I haven't had any accidents, or anything break on the car.  It still purrs along. 

 I still use Mobil One Synthetic oil and Purolator oil filters.  I haven't been up on the maintenance like I should be but I am aware of when the car really needs things looked after.  

The only problems I have with the car is that the driver's side window motor is notorious for failing and the brake rotors love to warp.  It is first noticeable by a slowing down of the window when going up and down.  Mine is at a crawl.  I will need to replace it someday. The brake rotors have been replaced by me and the wheels were properly torqued but the rotors still warped. They are not designed for anything other than daily driving.  Even then I am not impressed.

Since I have been laid off from Boeing last summer I plan to keep this car for a while.  I still owe about what it's worth.

ORIGINAL POSTING BELOW ...................................


  I bought this 96 Accord Ex with the Vtec and auto transmission in April of 99 with 32,000 miles.

    Cars I purchased new were:  93 Ford Escort Wagon, Two 95 mustang GT convertibles,  98 Ford Ranger Supercab Xlt 4x4.

    Cars I purchased used:  70 VW beetle,  67 VW beetle, 73 Ford Torino, 73 Ford Ltd, 85 Nissan Sentra

   I traded my Ranger in for this vehicle based on the fact that I moved and my commute was longer.   The Accord got better gas mileage and the the insurance was cheaper.   

   I paid a little below high blue book when I bought this car.   The car is engineered very well.   Hondas have been among the top selling and top recommended cars for years.   American car manufacturers still haven't figured it out yet.

   If you go to the National Highway transportation safety board on the web and search for similar year Ford Tauruses you will find about ten or so technical service bulletins for the Honda and about  two hundred or so for the Taurus.  (www.nhtsa.gov)  TSB's are documents that the manufacturer comes out, with after making the vehicle,  that show defects that numerous people have encountered on that particular vehicle.   Honda has a very low count.  

   My first career choice was as an Auto Technician.    I have a  two year degree in the Automotive/diesel technology field, along with being an ASE certified Master Automobile Technician,  ASE Truck Technician, various electrical, oscilloscope certifications, some time as a service advisor,  selling parts and four years of Ford dealership experience as an automotive technician.   I can tell you based on this  that Honda is definitely at the top as far as quality, engineering, and functionality go with their cars. 

  This is where I am coming from when I write this Epinion.



  Even though the Accord is a  relatively quiet ride,  I  took out all the seats, carpet, trunk materials, door panels etc in order to add soundproofing to the car.   I got to see the attention to detail that Honda used when assembling their car as far as  grommets, seals,  rubber weather stripping, bolts etc.   This attention to detail is lacking compared to other cars in this class.  

  The fit and finish of the body panels is great.  The doors shut solid.  The car has decent power, and  gets decent mileage.   The car handles good at higher speeds.  I generally drive at 80 and above when I can.   I have had it at  122 (according to the speedo anyways) and the ride was still solid, quiet and smooth. I only recommend driving at this speed with speed rated tires.   The interior space is adequate.

  One thing I noticed about this car compared to other cars in this class is that on the rear light assemblies the turn signal lights are a separate amber color.   This is a much safer setup than having a red turn signal light.  Yellow is  color more easily noticed than red and is  not mistaken for  a brake light.     

  The front headlights also have  separate high and low beams for each side.   A total of four lights.    This is much better than having a single 9004 bulb on each side of the car.   The reason being is that you can have all four filaments on at the same time, during high beam,  giving great illumination of the road.  Vehicles with one bulb on each side can only have one filament on each side lit up at one time due to the excessive heat build up within the capsule.  

 Much thought went into the production of this car that.   This thought is lacking in many other cars and  that is why Honda still is on top after so many years of building cars.   They just don't get the repeat complaints and problems of other auto makers  production junk.

  Resale value holds very well with a very gradual decline in value over the years compared to other vehicles in this class that have more of a quicker and steeper drop off in value.  In addition it is easier to sell a well maintained Honda that it is to sell a well maintained  KIA,  Hyundai,  Taurus etc.

  My 96 now has about  70,000 miles on it.  All the systems work great.  I do my own maintenance using  Mobil one synthetic oil and Genuine Honda oil filters. 

 I have added a remote start, integrated into my alarm, which makes driving the vehicle more enjoyable.   No more cold car in the winter or hot car in the summer when I get in to drive.

  Also I have purchased the original  and complete Factory Service manual along with the  factory electrical troubleshooting manual.    If you are not familiar with these books they cost about  $103 from www.helminc.com and they are basically the blueprint for the entire vehicle.   They go into great detail with every single electrical schematic, troubleshooting flowcharts,  location of every single component, connector, wire location, with pictures,  and every spec you could imagine.   There is no need to take the car to the dealership when you have these books and a little know how.

  If you are going to buy a used car then consider a Honda.  I feel you will be much happier in the long run
