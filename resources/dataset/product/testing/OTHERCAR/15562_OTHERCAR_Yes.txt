            My husband is in the contracting business and purchased his Astro used (old phone co. van) when he sold it 5 yrs later, he had 115,000 miles and still ran great!  When I needed a much bigger vehicle due to expanding our family with twins, we headed out to look at the Astro passenger vans and purchased one.  

I do not call it a mini van, I call it a mid size van.  It is much roomier than most mini vans out there.  I love the 3 rear doors, great for putting a double stroller in and out.  The middle bench seat is much longer than the norm, so two car seats fit extremely well.  There are only two things that I dislike about this van.  One is that there is not an option for double sliding doors like most new mini vans but then again, this is one reason why the middle bench seats are much longer.  Second, there is a little storage compartment right above the drink holder so if you have a drink, you can not access that compartment (minute I know!)

As far as how this runs, we discovered it has a little shake to it once it hits over 70 mph on the high ways.  But in the city, it runs like a charm, smooth for such a big vehicle and not much noise at all.  I have heard that the Astro's tend to wear tires quicker due to it's body frame.

Who should buy it?  A big family should!  I have three kids, two in car seats, my husband and I and we have PLENTY of room!!!

I do want to add that we looked at many vans before we made this purchase since I really wanted the  double sliding doors.  We also looked at price and Astro's are definatly less in cost for sure!  I wanted something simple, roomy and not get us in debt up to our eyeballs!<br><br>
