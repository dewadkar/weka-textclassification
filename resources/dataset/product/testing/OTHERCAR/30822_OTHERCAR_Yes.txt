            My family is spread out from coast to coast so we e-mail a lot of pictures back and forth. I decided that I wanted to get a digital camera to be able to take pictures, retake if necessary (immediately), and be able to download the images to my PC.

Reading specs revealed that I wanted something over 1 Meg pixels but, being a relatively new technology, I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  The D-340-R met the requirements: known manufacturer of cameras, proper specs, small physical size and lightweight, and proper price range!

It is a great camera. It has several photo quality degrees from simple 30K JPEGs to 3.5M TIFFs. It comes with an 8 meg card, software, and interconnect cables for the PC.  I bought a 16 meg card and a power supply (downloading images will draw down the AA batteries pretty quick!)

It has met all my expectations and more! I don't think the 16 Meg card was necessary unless you're planning on doing the uncompressed SHQ (TIFF) imagery, but the power adapter is needed (even though the price of it is outrageous!)
