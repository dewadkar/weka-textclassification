                Well, I'm a single person, no kids. And I make a lot of small trips, going house-to-house in my capacity as a music teacher. I searched over a year for my next car, one that was affordable (under $12k) and would give good gas mileage. And as a larger person I was concerned about "fitting" in a new vehicle. Fortunately, the Toyota Echo's seats and belts are quite roomy. It has a tilt steering wheel! 

    After emailing for quotes from various dealers I went to the lowest bidder (Longo Toyota, in El Monte, CA) and picked up my Echo. Surprisingly, my experience there was the exact opposite of those at the other lots I had visited. Perhaps it was because I was dealing with the Internet Manager and they knew I was there to *BUY*. 

    The Internet manager at Longo (Kevin Holley) was very pleasant. I did have to wait about 45 minutes for his attentions since he was finishing with another customer; it was Saturday and the rather large dealership was busy. He had told me via email what paperwork to bring and he guided me through the various forms and departments, informing me about what was occurring along the way. I ended up paying a little over invoice, and had no trouble getting close to the kbb.com value for my trade-in.

    After he gave me the keys he took the time to answer questions and show the features of the vehicle. The whole process took about 3 hours and even my interview with the  Finance/Insurance guy wasn't that bad; he offered but did not excessively push the Lo-Jack and extended warranty.

    This dealership is about 45 miles from where I live. On the way home I began to appreciate the Echo's smooth, quiet ride. I have just the basic radio, but thanks to the surround-sound speakers the AM/FM sounded full and rich. Vents and A/C worked well, not too noisy. There are ample cupholders, a double glove compartment and lots of pockets; I even found a place to stash my Thomas Guide. Trunk space on the 2-door seems deep and adequate, thanks to the vehicle's high "tail". The dash controls are mounted in the middle rather than over the steering wheel, unique among any car I had seen. You have to decide for yourself whether this odd placement is a 'bug' or a 'feature'. It made me balk initially, but after a while I got used to it and grew relieved that the display was not half-hidden by the steering wheel. The speedometer and fuel gauge are black-on-white and glow green in the dark. In spite of the teesny tires (Firestones!) cornering is not so bad, rather like any car in its class. But watch out for driving in high winds!

     This is a "tall" compact, like the Focus, and one advantage is the easy access/egress. You don't have to "climb out" of this car. Overall the seating was pretty comfortable for my almost 1-hour trip, though I could see how one would want to stretch one's legs and rest one's bottom after an extended drive. The seat belt is adequate, but it keeps riding up toward my throat! I wish it had a height-adjustable seat  door anchor, so I could adjust it down toward my shoulder (I'm 5'5"). It's not available on the 2-dr model (4-dr only)

    Acceleration is smooth- if a little slow. No jackrabbit starts here! But it's a commuter, not a race car. The Echo has no engine temperature gauge or tachnometer, but by listening closely I could hear the gear changes. There are lots of idiot lights, though. There is an overdrive button on the shift lever, which I found a bit confusing- until it was explained to me that it wasn't for 5th but 3rd gear, useful for climbing hills and the like. 

     Overall, I think it's a good car. Not luxurious, but enough to get you where you want to go in comfort. Be warned, though...it could be mistaken for Toyota's more expensive gas-electric hybrid. Last night one of my students saw it and wondered if I had bought a new Prius!
