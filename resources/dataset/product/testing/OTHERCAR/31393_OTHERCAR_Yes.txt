            This is my first new car, so I spent quite a bit of time researching the market.  I originally was looking at the Saturn series or perhaps a Cavalier.  I wasn't overly impressed with either one, but wanted to stay with a GM car because I get a family discount.  My brother recommended that I look at the Alero and I'm sure glad that he did. 

Not only is the Alero a much better looking car, but it comes with a lot more features for the same price.  I especially love the &quot;reminder lights&quot; which tell you when you need to change the oil, when your tires are going low and when you're running out of windshield washer fluid (which really helps during Michigan winters). It handles really well and is a very smooth ride.  The ride is pretty quiet and the engine doesn't rev too loudly.   The sound system is not bad for a basic package.  

The insurance on the Alero was very reasonable. The only complaint that I have with the car is the way the trunk is constructed.  While very roomy, it tends to drip water or snow into the truck when opened.  Other than that, I have to say that I'm VERY satisfied with this car!!<br><br>
