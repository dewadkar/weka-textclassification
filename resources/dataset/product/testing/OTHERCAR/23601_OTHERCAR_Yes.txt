            This is my first Epinion submitted. I just thought I would look at anything written about my favorite car. I love my 1993 indy red Dodge Intrepid. I was very attracted to its overall looks and was able to buy it new as a company vehicle and later purchased it as my personal auto in 1996. I presently have about 98000 miles on it and find it to be the best car I have owned. I have owned a few in my life (approximately 5 used and 4 new). I am semiretired and used to drive a fair amount of city miles. I love the way it handles and the ride is comfortable. I used to have some back trouble in my previous company cars but not in the Intrepid. Best seat I can remember. The mileage is still great (about 22mpg overall) and I have only had two very concerning problems with this car. The transmission locked up on me in passing gear one time. I naturally made a fuss over it with the dealer and they did take care of it by rebuilding it. The air conditioner is not suited for this car, Thanks to all the government regulations regarding freon etc. Again Dodge took care of this problem they gave me a new compressor and covered it under warranty. All other service on this vehicle has been normal. Only have done a couple of brake jobs and two tune ups.<br><br>
