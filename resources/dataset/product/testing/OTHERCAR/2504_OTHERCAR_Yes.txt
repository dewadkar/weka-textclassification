            After several disappointments with new vehicles, and frustration over haggling with automobile salespersons, my husband and I decided several years into our marriage, never to purchase a new vehicle again. We have been able to find several dealers who sell used program cars or repossessed vehicles below market value. Four years ago, we found a <i> 1997 Jeep Cherokee Sport </i>  with @ 21,000 miles. We were able to purchase this vehicle for $15,000. Granted, this SUV is "no frills." It has standard features including the 4.0 liter 6 cylinder engine, automatic transmission, cloth seats, air conditioning, rear window defogger, power side mirrors, driver side air bag, and adjustable seats. I does not have power door locks,power windows, cruise control, keyless entry or 4 wheel drive. I am the primary driver of this vehicle. 

In dash features are easy to use with three dials for temperature control, and 2 buttons for defroster, and window defogger. There is a button on the left side of the steering column for the headlights. A power outlet and lighter are also in the console area. The blinkers and windshield wiper controls are conveniently mounted on eithers side of the steering column. The power side mirrors are operated by buttons on the driver side arm rest under the window. One nice feature, that I have not found on other vehicles is an audible warning when the gas gauge is at the 1/8 tank mark. Another nice feature is map pockets on the driver and passenger side doors. 

The console includes a stationary arm rest with storage area for CDs or tapes, the gear shift and two average size cup holders with an ashtray, that we use for additional storage. The glove box is of average size. The vehicle has two bucket seats, and a bench seat that converts into additional storage in the cargo area. It comfortably seats 5 average sized people. The cargo area is quite spacious when the back seat is converted. We are able to pack enough luggage for a weeks vacation, and two sets of golf clubs with no difficulty. There is also a luggage rack on the roof, that we have never used.

The instrument panel contains all of the standard features including a trip odometer and ABS light, which I find comforting. The radio/cassette player is high quality with automatic rewind and above an above average hidden speaker system.

One of the drawbacks of this vehicle is that the spare tire is mounted in the cargo area on the driver side, resulting in the risk of a blind spot in that area. The vehicle is also, not the most comfortable vehicle for a long trip since the seats are not ergonomically designed. I neglected once, to completely close the driver side door, and woke up the next morning to a dead battery, due to running the interior light overnight. The mileage is average at about 16-18 miles per gallon.

In the 4 years that we have owned this vehicle, we have replaced the break pads twice. However, we do a lot of driving over hilly terrain, which can stress even the best of breaking systems. Other than that, this vehicle has been extremely reliable. I especially like the powerful engine that allows me to pass slower drivers, even on the hilly inclines that I drive daily.

My Jeep now has @72,000 miles on it, and I plan to keep it at least until the 80,000 mile mark. I like some of the newer designs on <i> SUV's </i> and I am glad to see that even the newer model has kept the stately front grille work, that I find very attractive. I would not think twice about purchasing a second Jeep product due to the rugged reliability of the model I now own. My sister in law has well over 200,000 miles and counting on her Jeep Cherokee. Now that's reliability!
