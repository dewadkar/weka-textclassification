            Our family purchased a new 1994 Mazda 626 from the dealer in 1994.  The first day that we drove the car home from the car dealership, the brakes were not working. The car rode like you were riding with the emergency brake pulled up and it was hard to drive past 40 mph on the highway. We brought the car in for servicing at the Mazda dealership and when we got the new car back, they had put 500+ miles on the new car.  Since then, the brakes have had to be replaced twice and adjusted so many times, that it is hard to keep track.  The brakes needed constant adjustment since they were constantly making a ear-splitting, high-pitched squealing every time that the brakes were pressed.  The transmission has also been replaced once. This car is a family vehicle that only has 50,000 miles on it.  In my opinion, the Mazda 626 isn't worth the money when there are so many other good cars on the market.<br><br>
