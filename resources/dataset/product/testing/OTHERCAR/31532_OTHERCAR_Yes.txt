            Three months ago I bought the 2001 Nissan Sentra SE.  This was a great day for me!  This car is the most reliable car at a reasonable price.  If your looking to spend under $20,000, but drive a car that will last and give you few to no problems - the Nissan Sentra is your car!!  So far I have no complaints on my Sentra.  It's a comfortable ride, with roomy seats, great sound system and I love the look!  The front is very similar to the Nissan Maxima.  My past car was the Pontiac Grand Am, which I rate extremely poor compared to the Nissan Sentra, or any Nissan for that matter.  I'm definitely a Nissan driver forever!!<br><br>
