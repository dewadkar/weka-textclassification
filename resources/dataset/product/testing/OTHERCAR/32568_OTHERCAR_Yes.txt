            I bought a Saturn SL1 after my trusty 1986 Toyota Corolla died.  We initially went to Saturn because of their no haggle policy.  As first time car buyers shopping with an infant we didn't want to get taken for a ride. (my dad bought my other car, and boy does he bargain)  We had heard about these Saturns but didn't know any real specifics of the car.  Our salesman helped us pick out our car, figure out a lease that we could afford, bought us numerous sodas, and even took us out to lunch.  I was very impressed when the finance people stayed until way past 11pm one night to figure out what we could afford!
Even after we decided to upgrade our SL to the SL1 after two weeks using their trade-in policy, we were met with nothing but kindness.  I have owned this car for three years and have had no problems whatsoever.  My gas mileage is great, and I suggest you run, not walk to your local Saturn dealer!!!!<br><br>
