            Buy this car if you want a sports dream ride ... without the cost. And one other hint: Buy it in red. 

I have been driving a 1999 Pontiac Sunfire GT since July of 1999. While you are conscious that you haven't hit the six and eight-cylinder domain of such sportster rides as the Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro, it offers many of the perks. For example, my Sunfire GT came equipped with power windows and door locks as well as other amenities: power sunroof, CD player, wider tires and even steering wheel radio controls!

The best feature of the GT sunfire is the dual exhaust -- my friends know it's me on the road just by this sharp feature!

There are pros, however. The anti-lock brakes leave much to be desired, the radio controls are a little touchy sometimes, and the steering, while power, is still based on the rack and pinion approach for a stiffer ride. 

If you're lookin to win the Indy 500, stick your nose up at this car. But if you're window shopping for the best sports car under $16,000 ... skip the Sunfire's close seconds (Plymouth/Dodge Neon, Chevrolet Cavalier), and head right to your GM dealer.
