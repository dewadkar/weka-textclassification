            I needed a camera pronto.  I've been captivated by the ease of use and creative possibilities of digital cameras from the beginning, so that decision was an easy one.  I drove all over town comparison shopping and settled on this Sony model.  The reasons are many: 1.  Reasonable price ($400)  2. Lens ring is threaded to accept optional filters and lenses, which is very important if one is to maximize creativity,  3. Memory stick eliminates the piles of used floppies that would undoubtedly rise after purchasing a comparably priced Mavica (eco-friendly!),  4. The rechargeable (again, eco-friendly!) battery is quite powerful.  5. The construction feels solid, like it will last for years. 6. Features include a night-vision selection which allows photos to be taken in darkness. Acceptable photos in near-blackness are possible, and spectacular evening city shots easy to take! 

I have been enjoying my new camera very much!  I'm impressed with the crispness and clarity of the pictures.  I just ordered an accessory kit, and look forward to buying a few special lenses.  Of course there are digital cameras with more features, higher pixel resolution, movie-modes, and on and on.  But if you are looking for a camera that gives you what you need without having to take out a second mortgage, you won't go wrong with this little beauty!
