            Among drivers who spend at least part of their time in the backcountry, the Toyota 4Runner has long had a reputation as an agile and durable off-road performer. Since its introduction in 1984, the 4Runner has been built on the same tough platform as Toyota's compact pickup, now called the Tacoma. With the truck, though, it's also shared a reputation for a punishing ride on freeways and smooth city streets that is every bit as well deserved as its off-road capability.

All that's changed, however, in 2003: after an eighteen-year marriage, the Tacoma and the 4Runner have agreed upon a divorce. Wonder who's getting custody of the Matrix?


<b>More than a Facelift</b>

The 4Runner's new platform (which it shares with the new Lexus GX-470) has added both bulk and heft - it's almost six inches longer than the 2002 model, translating into about two inches more legroom for both front- and rear-seat passengers. The cabin's also been widened for extra shoulder and hip room. Driver and passenger alike get plenty of headroom in the new design, with comfortable if somewhat flat and firm seating. The entry-level trim SR-5 boasts an eight-way manually operated driver's seat; upgrading to the top-of-the-line Limited Edition raises the bar to eight-way powered and heated seats. Ahhh, the lap of luxury, eh? Overall, the cabin measures out at 103 cubic feet of space, with forty-one in the cargo area behind the rear seat.

The 2003's exterior shape is little changed from 2002, other than a some "pumping up" to increase its overall size. The amount of poly cladding has increased, following the recurring theme demonstrated by almost all current SUVs. The 4Runner's truck-based roots still show in its overall design, with a long hood and low roofline as dead giveaways to its lineage. As in 2002, the 4Runner still bears a horizontal-format grille as opposed to the Jeep-like set of teeth that appeared on the Tacoma in 2001.

It is underneath, however, that the 4Runner underwent the greatest metamorphosis. Gone is the base 4-cylinder engine, gone is the jittery suspension inherited from the Tacoma, gone is any hope of ever seeing a manual transmission again. Say hello to a beefy 4-liter standard V6 with an electronically-controlled 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission, and do a double take when you see the optional V8 - yes, a V8 - with a five-speed automatic. The suspension's undergone revision as well, improving the 4Runner's highway ride, although mud lovers are concerned about sacrificing off-road capability to build a larger SUV with a more car-like ride. More to the point, Toyota has tossed in some highly sophisticated electronics to boost the 4Runner's roadworthiness.


<b>The Guts</b>

For 2003, Toyota has introduced a new 4-liter V6 as the standard engine in the redesigned 4Runner, replacing the 3.4-liter model still used in the Tacoma (and perhaps hoping to stem the tide of complaints over "sludge" buildup in Toyota V6s). The V6's numbers? Matched to the 4-speed automatic transmission with gated shifter, the V6 generates 245 hp @5200 rpm / 283 lb-ft @ 3400 rpm, and has an estimated mileage of 18/21mpg for the 2WD or 17/20 for the 4WD (city/highway). The first-ever V8 for a 4Runner (a 4.7-liter plant borrowed from the full-sized Tundra pickup) puts out 235 hp @ 3400 rpm, but makes up for the diminished horsepower with increased torque (320 lb-ft @ 3400 rpm). The V8, which is matched to a 5-speed automatic transmission, is rated at 17/19 mpg in 2WD, 16/19 for the heavier 4WD. Both engines are certified LEV, by the way. All configurations of the 4Runner have a 5000-lb towing capacity, and a curb weight than ranges from just over 4000 lb to a tick under 4200 lbs.

The suspension, though, has undergone even more significant updating than the power train. Starting from the redesigned frame - still a ladder-style truck frame - Toyota has smoothed out the ride with coil spring/gas shock combinations on all wheels, and double-wishbone suspension on the front. The rear suspension is a four-link configuration with an optional adjustable air-suspension available on the Limited edition with a V8 engine. A diagonally-linked suspension system designed by Yamaha (the X-REAS system used on the Celica Supra) is standard on the middle trim line, the Sport Edition, and available on the Limited Edition This innovative system does for suspension what traction sensors do for wheel slippage, dynamically stiffening shocks on one side (or corner) of the vehicle while simultaneously "loosening" the ride on the opposing side. Toyota markets this as a "sport-enhanced suspension."

A new hill start assist system is standard in all configurations; it's designed to prevent any backward roll when starting on a steep hill. All models are also delivered with electronically based vehicle skid control. 4WD models come with a limited-slip center differential and Toyota's new downhill assist control. DAC is a computer-based braking system that keeps the vehicle's speed within a narrow range (2-4 mph) on steep descents. The system is designed to control the descent speed, thereby reducing the potential for a skid due to brakes locked by a panicky driver.


<b>The Drive</b>

I started looking for a new 4Runner to drive when I learned that the highway ride had been dramatically improved. I'd driven a <a href="/content_64632753796">2002 4Runner</a> several months ago and, though used to the vehicle's ride from years spent in Toyota pickups, felt that the model was definitely due for an overhaul - especially in the area of highway ride. Let me say right off the bat that I wasn't disappointed: Toyota must have heard me, and they listened! San Marcos Toyota gave me a V6 SR5-2WD model to drive, almost entirely standard equipment except for an upgrade to leather seats. 

At first blush, the new 4Runner doesn't <i>look</i> particularly different from previous models, that is, until you realize that the passenger compartment is noticeably wider and the back seat roomier. The seating position is classic 4Runner - after a long climb into the cab, the driver settles into a low bucket seat; a position that still affords clear sight lines in all directions. The instrument panel has undergone significant changes: the instruments are mounted in three circular wells with matte chrome rims. The instruments are white on black, with orange illumination at night. The dashboard, too, has been redesigned - most notably the controls for the climate control, which are now five-armed soft-touch toggles instead of twist knobs. Seating was comfortable without being too soft, and the controls and instruments were all within easy reach for my average-sized arms and legs.

Once out on the road, I learned that the 4Runner has <i>definitely</i> undergone a metamorphosis: the new suspension irons out road irregularities with aplomb, and handles larger lumps and bumps (railroad crossings, for instance) with far less jouncing than other mid-sized truck-based SUVs I've driven lately (including the <a href="/content_60937309828">Nissan Xterra</a> and <a href="/content_53938851460">Jeep Liberty</a>). Twisties and turnies are handled smoothly and without protest; even with a longer wheelbase, the 4Runner still feels sure-footed in the curves, and its 36-foot turning circle will come in handy in parking garages. I did not note body roll in low-speed maneuvers, and highway handling was deft at highway speeds. The larger V6 (I'm used to a 183-hp 3.4-liter) has plenty of acceleration for a vehicle this size; I'm not even certain a V8 would be needed unless an owner is considering towing on a regular basis. Braking felt perhaps a tad weak; though I didn't attempt anything in terms of a panic stop. There was no noticeable plow when braking. 

At street and freeway speeds alike the 4Runner proved quiet, with minimal road and wind noise intruding on the passenger compartment. The engine's low noise level is commendable; and that V8 engine is even quieter.

Above all, the most salient feature of the redesigned 4Runner is the tremendous improvement in ride. It's still not the cushy car-like ride of, say, a BMW X5, but it's suddenly worlds away from the trucky ride of an Xterra or even last year's 4Runner. Whether the softening of the ride will adversely affect off-road capability only time will tell, but Toyota has put some effort into living up to the 4Runner's off-road reputation.


<b>Amenities</b>

The list of standard features is, well, pretty much par for the course. Even on the base-level SR5 (I remember when the SR5 was the "fancy" trim, do you?) you'll find power windows and locks, power mirrors, a tilt and telescope steering column. Add to this standard AC, cruise control, and rear-seat climate control and you have... well, you have pretty much the standard package for all the competition. Toyota has also thrown in some extra goodies, including an information console displaying fuel consumption, time, and ambient temperature (among with other information); powered lumbar support adjustment, and integrated hitch receiver; not to mention the usual goodies like cup- and bottle-holders (four for the back seat in the rear doors), 12-volt power outlets, and both an oversized console between the seats and a ceiling console for sunglasses and garage-door opener.

The usual options are available: a leather package, roof rack, powered sunroof, 115-volt power outlet, auto-dimming rearview mirror, running boards, and an anti-theft system.

If you spring for the Limited edition, the anti-theft system is included, along with full-power seats (heated), the roof rack, fog lamps, dual-zone automatic climate-control, leather, lighted mirrors, automatic headlights, rear-seat audio controls and wireless headphones, and a Home-Link universal transceiver system.

Some of the niceties engineered into the 4Runner this time around are:
- the trip odometer reset button has been moved to the rim of the instrument cluster, so you don't need to fish around behind the steering wheel looking for it
- a pair of parabolic mirrors is mounted on the D pillars (just inside the rear window) to let you look sideways when backing out of a parking spot - just what you need in a parking lot full of Suburbans with opaque rear windows
- an optional folding two-level cargo compartment is available, its top shelf supports up to about 60 pounds.


<b>Safety</b>

All 4Runners come equipped with dual multi-stage front airbags, three-point harnesses and headrests at all seating positions, ABS with electronic brake-force distribution, vehicle skid and traction control, child safety locks, and Child Safety Seat anchors and tethers. The front seatbelts have pretensioners, and the driver's harness is equipped with an emergency locking retractor system

Daytime running lights are an option, as are front-seat side curtain airbags and front-and-read and overhead airbags.


<b>The Tale of the Notes</b>

The new suspension and engines have created a true mid-sized SUV that's more than competitive with the Trailblazer/Envoy and the Explorer. It's odd that Toyota now offers two mid-sized SUVs, though it's apparently the corporate belief that the Highlander will attract the crowd who wouldn't dare get the vehicle muddy while the 4Runner is still - ostensibly - aimed at the offroad crowd. Though by no means car-like, the ride in the 4Runner is vastly improved. And don't forget, if previous history holds true, the redesigned 4Runner will prove to be one of the most durable and dependable lines on the road. 

That being said, there are some downsides to the redesign: the increase in passenger room has necessarily increased size, which will surely bring a concomitant reduction in off-road handling. Then, too, the more powerful engines have but fair to moderate fuel economy, and to make matters worse, <b>Toyota recommends 91-octane premium gasoline</b> for both -- this is according to some published sources; owners have reported here that the manual doesn't contain such a recommendation. An oft-cited disadvantage of previous 4Runners still holds true, the lack of available rear seating locks this vehicle to a maximum of five passengers - a definite disadvantage when compared to its domestic competition. The price tag, too, is a bit daunting - a stripped SR5 bears a base price of $28K, with prices all the way up to $36K-plus for a fully tricked-out Limited 4WD with the optional V8 engine. 

Still and all, the 4Runner appears to have undergone a wholesale redesign and come out the other side with its most important virtues still intact. Kudos to Toyota for an excellent redesign job.
