            We bought a CRV about 6 months ago after looking at other SUV's like the Nissan Xterra, The Suzuki Vitara series, and others in the same price bracket.  I can't say whether it's the best of breed or not, but for the price, it is great.  

It drives very much like a sport car: has good pick up (no balls at higher speeds though), and turns like it's on rails.  Also, the fact that Honda has so much faith in their cars that you only have to change oil and get maintenance after every 12,000 kms (8000 miles?).  

The only thing I would say that i don't like about this vehicle is the looks.  It's kind of old lady looking.  Doesn't compare to the cool look of the Xterra, that's for sure, but the Xterra is a rough ride and heavy on the gas.  

And of course it's a Honda, so it's got to be good!  ;-)<br><br>
