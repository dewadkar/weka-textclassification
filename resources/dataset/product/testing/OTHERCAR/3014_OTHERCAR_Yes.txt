            I started looking at the (then) Geo Metro about 2 years before I bought my '94.  I rented one (an automatic) when our old car died the day of the family Christmas party 60 miles away.  I saw this as a perfect opportunity to try one of these little bugs on for size.  My family and I (two kids at that time, 10 and 7) got there and back with no problem even though that night it was freezing rain on the trip back.

I bought my '94 in 1995 with 17,700 on the clock from a dealer for $6,000.  I even had them put a cruise control into it.  Just made the last payment the first of this month.  I've been driving the car over 25,000 miles a year since then.  Mind you this IS a SMALL car (and I am 6'4&quot; and weigh 250 lbs) but I fit just fine.  The guys at work refuse to believe it when I get into the little bugger, let alone commute ~90 every day.  Add to this that I get 53+mpg, even the way I drive.

In short, &quot;I LOVE THIS CAR!&quot;

For one person the acceleration is snappy enough (provided you *know* how to use a clutch and stick shifter) for my highway commute every day.  Even with two adults it's still mighty respectable.  Put three in it and you'll still do OK but don't bet the pink slip on a race or anything.

Earlier this month I took my daughter to camp (~830 miles round trip.  Total seat time was about 15 hours.)  While not like driving a Caddie it was comfortable enough.

I've got almost 147,000 miles on my Geo now and have had to have a brake job done (along with a muffler or two).  I'm going to have to get some minor rusting fixed by Ye Olde Bondo wizards this summer but that should hold me for another 5 years.   A very minor oil leak (more of a seepage really) from my engine (it will leave about 2 or 3 DROPS of oil per month on my driveway) but that's just about it as far as problems with the car.

I've just placed my order for a 2000 Metro for said daughter to drive back and forth to school.  I had planned on waiting 'til next Summer but the bean counters at Chevy have decreed that 2000 is the last year the Metro will be available to mere mortals.  (From what the dealer told me only the rental car companies will be able to buy it???  Go figure.)

I'm so sold on the Metro that if I had the cash I'd buy 3 more and keep them as spares to use until I retire.

One final thing though, I bought this car realizing that if I ever get in an accident my *widow* won't have to buy me a coffin.  Shoot, just after I got the car I was showing the engine off to my father and brother-in-law.  I leaned on the quarter panel and DENTED IT WITH MY THIGH!!!

Like one of the other reviewers said, be sure you have enough life insurance.

I would absolutely recommend this car to someone who drives a lot of miles and is frugal (read CHEAP!) and is done being concerned about projecting a 'cool' image to their fellow road warriors.
