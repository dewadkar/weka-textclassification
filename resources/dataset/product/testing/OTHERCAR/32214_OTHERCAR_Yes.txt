            	Quite simply, the New Carrera is a perfect sports driving machine. With the Turbo S option, this car is so fast it's SCARY! Added to that, the advanced traction control system and easy sportomatic shifter make it a very manageable car to handle, but don't worry--it's still fun, especially for someone who really likes to DRIVE his or her car!

	Added to incredible performance, the Porsche is just beautifully designed and engineered, from the bodywork to the engine itself. While a little cramped on the inside, it is still extremely comfortable (and I'm 6'1, with long legs!) and very worthy of a drive down the coast from Oregon to Southern California. Take this thing up Big Sur, or any winding mountain road, and you will have an unbeatable driving experience. The only down side is that it IS a fairly small car, even for a sports car, which can be daunting at times in a world dominated by SUVs and trucks, but the speed and maneuverability of the Carrera more than make up for its lack in size. And with a plethora of safety features, you will never feel threatened in this car.

	So fill 'er up with some high octane fuel, put on your driving gloves, and have a thrilling drive!<br><br>
