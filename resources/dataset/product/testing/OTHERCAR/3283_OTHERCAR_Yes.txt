            History:
     In 1990, a company named Eagle produced, in cloberation with Diamond Star Motors and Chrysler, a new sports car called the Talon. The Talon came with three trim options: non-turbo, turbo, and turbo all-wheel-drive. The non-turbos were, in my opinion, extremely underpowered at approximately 95 horsepower. Unbelievably the turbo powered Talon came with 95 horsepower more, giving it an astonishing 190 ponies. In addition to that power, the option of all-wheel-drive gave the Talon the ability to make blistering acceleration off the line and fantastic handling during the rain or snow.
    In 1994, the talon was redesigned slightly with the raising automatic headlights deleted and the rear end tail lights reconfigured. The power of the base model was bumped up adequately to around 135 horsepower by means of an upgraded 2.0 liter DOHC engine. The turbo models kept the same power output.
    In 1995, the talon receive a total make over to look almost exactly like the same year mitsubishi eclipse cars. This was not surprising since the Talon has always had the same engine as the eclipse. The base models receive a 5 horsepower upgrade to 140 horsepower. The turbo powered models receive a 20 horsepower upgrade to 210 horsepower. Matched with an all-wheel-drive, this was enough power to destroy many V8's off the line. 

My Review:
    I own a 1995 Eagle Talon Tsi AWD and I've also owned a 1990 Eagle Talon Tsi (not AWD). The interior of the talon is certainly meant for a classy driver. The shifting is stiff and the front seats like pillows. The air-conditioning vents are strategically located for optimal usage - unlike many cars which simply put them anywhere. The leather wrap steering wheel and large gauges make for complete control over the vehicle. The rear seat is not meant for passengers, so don't bother. However, for two passengers, you could travel from California to Florida and still be ready for more. 
   As for the acceleration of the car, my all-wheel-drive makes the car feel like a rocket ship. The AWD keeps my car glued to the road and allows me to make turns on rails. 
   If you have the means to purchase one of these beauties, I highly recommend them, however, parents considering these for your young driving sons/daughters - beware! They can lead to a poor driving history that will haunt your young ones forever!
