            We purchased a Toyota Corolla in April of 1999.  We have heard so many good reviews on Toyotas we decided to go ahead an purchase on.  This car has not been a disappointment.  My husband uses this to drive to work everyday.  He has to travel 70 miles each way.  This car is really comfortable.  Plenty of leg room in the front and my kids have plenty of room in the back.  The car gets fairly good gas mileage, about 30 miles to the gallon.  We have had no problems other than routine maintenance.  This car offers a smooth, quiet ride.  My only complaint is that for a compact car I think it was a little pricey.  We did get the car loaded and payed about $17,000 for it.<br><br>
