             In my recent search for a new pickup truck I couldn't resist the chance afforded me to borrow my Father in laws new Chevy Silverado 1500 extended cab 2 wheel drive for a week.
The truck was a beautiful charcoal gray with dark gray interior, all the standard amenities, power locks, windows, tilt, cruise, CD and the 5.7 V8. 
 Sliding into the inviting interior, I attempted to adjust the seat to my likings to no avail. At first I figured as with any new vehicle it takes a while to get it just right, but after a week, it never happened. I found myself obsessed with trying to get comfortable. Poor lumbar support (even though it had the optional lumbar adjustment) No support under the legs, and oddly, it seemed as though the seat back was crooked. 
 The rear seat was adequate as expected for an extended cab truck, geared for short trips. The seat also folded down flat to haul those items that you don't want on the fabric, or in the bed. Unfortunately  a rear split bench  seat is not an offered as an option.

 The overall ride quality is good, a little rear axle hop over breaks in the pavement, quite except for wind noise around the drivers door. (which the dealer fixed later)

 Firing up the V8 was the highlight of this truck, being the power enthusiast that I am, I was very satisfied with. A very responsive engine, a lead foot will guarantee a speeding ticket. This thing ran so good at times I found myself reverting back to my teens, cruising around looking for unsuspecting victims to leave at the light. Caution is required on wet pavement, as you could easily melt the tires to the rims on dry pavement.
The transmission shifts nicely, but I did detect a slight rear axle noise at certain speeds.

 Other than the poor seats, the only other pet peeve I had was the annoying daytime running lights. The problem is that when it is dark, you have to think about turning on the headlights because the dash lights are on all the time, and the running lights are bright enough to fool you into thinking the headlights are on. Several times I found myself driving around with no tail lights, maybe safe in the daytime, but a hazard at night.

 Overall, the Chevy is a decent truck, a sort of a wolf in sheeps clothing, conservative looks, almost old fashion compared to the competition, and an engine that will not leave you asking for more power.
