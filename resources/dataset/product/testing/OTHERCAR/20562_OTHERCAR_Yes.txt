            I have had a chance to drive and ride in a 1999 Integra LS for a while now.  Although it has a smaller engine than most would like, it still has enough guts to beat people of the line.  With a few hundred dollars in modifications, it could be a real screamer.  Controls are well within reach.  Seats are comfortable for long periods of time.  My only gripe is the back seat.  Any person out side of a child will have trouble sitting back there.  It is ok for short trips around town, but not for any period of time.  All Integras come fully equipped with power everything, cd, moon roof, and great looking rims.  I would suggest the car to a 16 year old or a 66 year old.<br><br>
