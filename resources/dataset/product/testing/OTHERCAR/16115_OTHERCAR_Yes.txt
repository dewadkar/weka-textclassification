            I've enjoyed owning three Grand Cherokee ('93, '96, '00).  This is by far the best one in terms of engineering and (so far) freedom from factory defects.  With the 4.7 liter V8, the car has plenty of smooth power, although 12-15 mpg isn't great (but it's the first model to run well on el cheapo regular -- burning premium seems to cause no improvement in mileage).

Swapped out the factory Goodyear tires for Michelin All Terrains - the Goodyears howled at highway speeds.  With the Michelins, the car drives beautifully -- feels almost like a Lexus.

Good interior space, very comfortable leather seats even without the heated seat option -- don't seem to need it even with the cold Midwestern climate.  Rear passenger leg room just a bit tight, but better than earlier models.  Built-in 3-mode garage door/gate opener real nice.  

New door handles and grips allow for true one-finger opening.  Easy-to-read gauges and dashboard controls.

Only minuses -- although the heating/AC system is very good, the floor ducts seem to miss your feet.  AC is powerful enough for even the hottest days.  Dealer service is a big problem -- I've been to more than 6 different dealers (5 of which are "5-star" rated -- it's  a meaningless award), only one of these dealers is actually okay to work with, most of the time.  Real poor customer service attitude across the board.
