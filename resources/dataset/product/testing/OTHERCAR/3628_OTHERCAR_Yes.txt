            The 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix GT had a nice redesign and styling over the previous years, when it looked just plain ugly.  This model year is just plain nice.  A few minor bits, would include redesigning the spoiler as opposed to the current lip feel it has, and adding a stick shift option.

The pick up is nice, and a 0-60 that I tried is around 8 sec. and under a quarter mile.  The 200 horsepower V-6 engine purrs, but if you floor it, it roars.  The handling is nice, and the low center of gravity and wide base allows you to whip around turns.

One of the must options is 4-doors and leather seats.  Even though, I have a 2-door and it looks nice, getting in and out of the rear seats is a hassle, especially since two of the rear seats are semi-bucket.  Leather seats is a must for those long car rides, otherwise it would be comfortable for a few hours.

So far, it's been reliable, only the oil changes so far after 2 years.  It's fun to drive and more importantly, it can run on regular gas and get on average 18-20 miles to the gallon, especially since the price of gas has gone up dramatically in the past few months.<br><br>
