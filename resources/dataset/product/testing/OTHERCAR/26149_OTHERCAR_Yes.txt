            Yes, I will admit that I did not picture myself buying an SUV.  I was always used to a small car.  I drove a Honda Civic for 5 years, then my husband and I bought a house last year.  We were constantly borrowing a friend's truck to haul things back and forth from Home Depot.  So finally, we decided to get a larger, more practical vehicle.  We initally wanted the Acura MDX, but there was a 3 month waiting period!  So after researching and trekking around to various dealerships, we decided on the GMC Yukon.  And the dealer had some great interest rates and rebates.  

We bought it in February 2002, in garnet red.  We wanted maximum seating capacity, so we opted for the front bench seats rather than the bucket seats.  Unfortunately, this was only available on the SLE (lower model).  What the heck, we didn't mind cloth seats.  And we also got the removable 3rd row seats, so we are able to seat 9 people!  This car is definitely a big change from a little 2 door Civic.  But my husband and I LOVE it!  It really is a great car.  It's a V8, so it's got great power to be able to take on hills, as well as merge onto crazy freeway traffic.  I like being high up, and I noticed that it seems a little higher than some other SUV's, maybe it's just my imagination.  It handles turns and curves fairly well.  We also bought a small boat recently, and the engine doesn't even seem to feel the weight.  This is my first American car, and I'm pretty impressed.  

Even though it's only an SLE, which is the lower end, it still comes standard with most of the modern conveniences--alarm, automatic locks, 9-speaker stereo (not bad, but I'll still have to upgrade), a/c, anti-lock breaks, tinted windows (almost limo-tint), automatic daytime running lamps.  

Some minor features that I thought were nice--the windshield wiper fluid comes out of the wipers, not the hood, so it doesn't leave those annoying spots on the hood (maybe this is standard w/all SUV's, but since this is my first...); cup holders w/a REMOVABLE bottom, so you can just take it out and wash it in the sink, rather than having to maneuver your hands into those tight spots;  a power outlet in the back of the vehicle, a hood that stays propped up w/an included snakelight that comes in handy at night.

The ride is very smooth and I love the fact that I can seat 9 people, or fold down the seats and haul things.  My hubby and I even camped out once, and slept on a twin inflatable mattress in the car!  It's been over 6 months now, and I really am very happy with the Yukon.
