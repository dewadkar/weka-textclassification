            It can not be beat for cost and features! It has ample room to accomodate my tall wife with plenty of head room and leg room. It is very comfortable to ride in. Plenty of passing power. Fairly good gas milage 30-32 in town 34-37 on highway- at 12000 miles so far. It is smoother/ more quite than our previous experience with a 2001 Toyota Corrola. Handles the road like a much more expensive touring sedan. (I should know after owning Porsches, BMWs, Volvos.) I truly love the ride Kia offers with the Sephia. It is a pleasure to own- and Kia backs it up with a unbeatable warranty. Sales staff was not at all pushey! Plenty of features come stock with this car at a fraction of the cost of its rivals! Excellent A/C- cools the cab quickly in this Texas Summer heat. So far- so good!

The car is still on the road with no visits to the shop yet!  got 30000 miles on it- yes that is what I said, "30000 miles in less than a year"  No failures or any other problems for that matter. Looks, Sounds drives like new. Change the oil every 2500-3000 miles with Mobil1 Synthetic and drive on. Getting on average 30-32 miles per gallon.  Had the Windows tinted, and had an alarm installed. Had to have an automatic door popper installed to have auto-door lock with work with alarm- standard automatic locks need assistance with those type of alarms.
