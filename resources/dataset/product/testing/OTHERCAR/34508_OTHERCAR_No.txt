            This car left a great deal to be desired considering the Sticker price of $21,875.00.  It had to go back to the dealer to  have the hood realigned, the trunk realigned, and the doors rehung just to get the bodylines straightened out.  More work on the doors was required in order to get the windows to seat properly without howling when they were up.  To top it off, one of the remote keys had to be reprogrammed three times before a dealer just replaced it.  It became a 'hate relationship' when any other thing went wrong, due to problems experienced.

Other than the fact that is was a convertible and had a nice, responsive  2.4L engine with dual exhausts, the car was just so so.  The back seat had rather thin padding and could become uncomfortable quickly.

To put the value of the car in perspective, I traded it in with 11,000 miles in October 1999 and got a whopping $12,500 trade in on a new car.

This will probably be a good car to buy when it gets down to the $6-7,000 range and if it checks out mechanically sound.  One can put up with the normal inconveniences of convertible ownership for that kind of money.
