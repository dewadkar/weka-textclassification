            I cannot say much more about my CRV than I love it. I looked all around the market at different Compact Sport Utilities and every time I came back to the CRV. It's built off the Civic frame and many people say its not a true 4X4. I have to believe that these are the people that have never had a CRV in the Snow and Ice. I live in the Pacific NW and often I go over the pass area. On several occasions I encountered 4&quot; to 6&quot; of snow and compact ice. The CRV's four wheel drive kicked in and carried me away safe. It is absolutely incredible. The only negative I can find is that I wish it had more horepower. But if it did, I would not get the 27MPG that I get. Check this: What other Sport Utility gives you a removable picnic table and a cooler for storing cold beverages in the tailgate area? NONE-Just the CRV! One point of interest, Get leather interior. I did and like all vehicles, It increased my value and the look of my jet black Honda CRV. I paid $19,500 for my EX-Don't get the DX or the base model-They have less horse. Also the automatic has an awful overdrive button and its a total hassle!<br><br>
