            We bought this vehicle because we needed a minivan to fit our children in. I think it is a very nice looking vehicle on the inside and out. We have a 1995 3liter engine. We have found out that this year minivan has problems with its transmission. We started having trouble with it right after we bought it. We bought it used with 69,000 miles on it. When we got to 75,000 miles we had to take it to the shop because it was skipping gears. They said it only needed its bands tightened, which they did. That was fine till we got to 84,000 miles. Then they said it needed a new transmission. We then found out from other Dodge Caravan owners that they had trouble with their transmission too. This problem seems to also be in their cars with the same engine and transmission from 1995 and lower. I love the way the vehicle handles, but I think it is dangerous if you want this vehicle for a family vehicle. My transmission still doesn't feel right.<br><br>
