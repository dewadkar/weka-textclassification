            I have owned a Jeep Wrangler SE for two years now.  Before owning this SUV, I owned a sports car.  I can honestly say that I can not imagine owning a car again.  

A Jeep Wrangler is a wonderful vehicle for someone who does not need to transport many people or things.  While the back seat sits two people, it does not allow much leg room.  I have two children (10 and 16) who can ride in the back but it does not leave room for much else. 

The Jeep handles well in all types of weather.  I had some concerns about staying warm in cold weather with a soft top but I need not have worried as it heats up very well.

I do miss having power mirrors as the Jeep mirrors get bumped often in parking lots and moved out of position.  Also of some concern is the safety of belongings with a soft top.  I have to lock any items of value either in the &quot;add a trunk&quot; or the locking center console.  

For anyone who enjoys music, I would strongly recommend the optional sound bar.  This is great!!!!
