            Okay, okay.  The old Neon's had some problems.  Introduced in 1995, they were made as a cheap economy car.  That's what the public wanted, that's what the public got.  Things have changed, and people are not as focused on price anymore as they are quality.  Goodbye old Neon, hello new Neon!!

The new Neon does have a few problems left over from the old style.  Mainly, the one that comes to mind is it's laughable 3-Speed automatic transmission.  Still junk unfortunately, if you refuse to drive a 5-Speed, you better either lease or buy an extended warrenty!  They should seriously think about introducing a 4-Speed automatic, or at least re-gearing the 3-Speed.

Another problem I have with the new Neon is that it uses the old 2.0 Liter SOHC 4 cylinder engine.  Those engines had some severe problems with the head and the head gasket going very much prematurely.  They also dropped the powerhouse 2.0 Liter DOHC 4 cylinder engine (which pumped out 150 horsepower).  I miss the old Expresso style Neon and the Competition package (now that was a fast car...complete with adjustable suspension!)

So now that the bad stuff is out of the way, on to the good!  Driveability!  The old Neon's handled like a dream, and stuck to the road like glue.  It's hard to believe that Chrysler made that BETTER!  It's true!  A much nicer ride is added to the Chrysler Neon now.

I like the new style.  The back end, when I first saw it, looked like a mini-300M.  How cool is that?  It doesn't look like the wind-up happy car from 1995-1999.  Now it's something new and aggressive.

Thank you Chrysler for putting in a full frame door!  The old half doors on the Neon's made for some nasty road noise (and problems for quite a few people, too).  The new Neon is a much more quiet ride.  A very big improvement worthy your hard earned bucks.

More options available now, too.  Now you can buy a stock CD Player or nice alloy wheels for your Neon.  This is a big plus!  The old Neons had the potential to look classy, but it was through your own time and hard work through aftermarket products.

I love how they made the new Neon safer!  The old Neon was pretty well known for being a safe vehicle, especially for it's size.  They took something good and made it better.  Chrysler has always led the way in safety, and I'm glad to see the engineers are working hard.

Overall, the new Neon would be a heck of a good car, but the price has also gone up.  There IS a big window for pricing, but the options are what kills the MSRP.  A few adjustments of some quality issues would be nice, reintroduce the coupe model and the DOHC 4 cylinder, and put some optional power windows in the back seat and you have one GREAT compact car!  Be it your first car or last, this new Neon offers something for everybody!<br><br>
