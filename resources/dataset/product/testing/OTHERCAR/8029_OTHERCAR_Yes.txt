            With a limited budget, sweaty palms and prayers to the finance company, I started looking for a used car in 1997 to replace the one I'd driven to a state of being held together with rubber bands and paper clips. All I knew for sure was that I'd heard lots of good things about Saturns and, important to me, I wanted a car that was made in America. I looked in classifieds, watched the Saturday car ads and headed to the nearest Saturn dealer. Guess what had come onto the lot the night before? A 1992 Saturn SL1 with slightly more than 17,000 miles on it.

Buying this car was one of the smartest moves I've made in my long life. It performed wonderfully on a 3,820 mile move from south Florida to Idaho. It continues to give me what I want from a car - reliability, good looks, low maintenance and good mileage and it just turned over 50,000 miles. I know I can rely on having a good trade in when I replace it - with another Saturn product. And, I know that when I go to do it, the Saturn salespeople will treat me with respect, they'll answer my questions and the price won't change for some strange reason along the way.

I wish my '92 was a little higher off the ground, until I go around a corner and it feels like the center of gravity is about 5 feet below sea level. The car handles perfectly, and if you remember to change your gearshift setting if you're going to be driving more than 45-50 mph, you can punch it and move around, in front of, or out of the way of just about anything on the road. It turned a steady 75 mph on my cross-country trip even going up grades. And, something really important to me - my back didn't hurt after driving an 8 to 10 hour day.

I love my Saturn and it's fun when another Saturn owner of the same &quot;generation&quot; honks and says &quot;you've got a pretty good little car there.&quot;

I'm a believer!
