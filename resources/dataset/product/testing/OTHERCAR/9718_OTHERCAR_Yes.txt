            It's almost 2004 and this 1995 model still turns heads. Styling is eye-candy but the drooping curves make it impossible to know where the corners of the car are when parking or in tight spots. The dashboard wraps around the front seat and encapsulates the driver to give a feeling of security. I had all the extras and never did fully grasp all the nuances of the options within the seat adjustments, theft control, CD/radio/cassette, Passenger A/C control, etc. Consequently I found myself dependent on the manual when things started happening which I didn't quite comprehend..
The interior is luxurious with lots of room both upfront and back, although it is really only designed to handle 4 passengers. Basically the car was used to transport my wife and myself so there was no problem. However whenever we did have rear-seat passengers both entry and exit to the rear is awkward at best and quite challenging for older or "large" people. Also the huge doors (only comes in a 2-door model) can be a hazard. The trunk is also quite cavernous. The battery is located under the back seat which is a nice conversation piece but because of its unusual location it is the best (most expensive) battery made. I had to have mine replaced in 2002. There was a problem with the radio but it was covered by my platinum warranty. To replace a bulb in any of the rear lights one has to remove the entire rear assembly. There were other glitches but I am still driving this car today so clearly it's been very reliable. The engine is a work-horse and the supercharger really takes off when it's needed; a real safety feature in my books. I've driven only American cars (all of the 'Big 3') but I can truthfully say the 1995 Buick Riviera has been my favorite to date.
