            I love my suburban!  It is such a cool vehicle.  It is so roomy and comfortable, with a lot of options.  My personal suburban is a 94, and I still love it.  It does not have all of the same advantages of the new suburbans, like it only has a tape player instead of a cd player, but overall it is the same vehicle.  It has front and rear passenger ac control, cruise control, a tape player, airbags, power windows, power locks, keyless entry, and a lot of room.  Mine has 77,000 miles on it, and it still runs like a charm.  And it is a great car for a family of four and up.  I would highly recommend getting a suburban if you have a big family, and especially if you like going on long trips, this car is the cure to all of the arguments on the way.  Definitely go for a suburban, you won't regret it!<br><br>
