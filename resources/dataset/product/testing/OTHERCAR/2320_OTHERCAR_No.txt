            We bought this car in August 1999 during our last semester of college. We needed something with four wheels and an engine, and Kia seemed to fit the bill. So we bought a '99 Sephia. It was risky, but we had a 100,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty...or so we thought.
 
Within the first week, we were back at the dealership for a defective rear defrost switch. This was the first of many such problems. In the coming months, the car was back to the dealership repeatedly for minor, yet annoying, hiccups...two recalls for the fuel system, spontaneously exploding windows (micro-defects in the glass), batteries dying way before they're supposed to, new brake rotars at under 20K miles, alignment issues, door seals falling off, coolant leaks, etc. Almost all of these problems were covered under warranty, but when we passed 50K miles, we were told that the warranty was "pro-rated" and that we had to pay. That was news to us!

More warranty woes at 61K miles. This was the big one. The transmission failed, and to our dismay, it was NOT covered. The warranty on the transmission ended at 60K miles. At this point, we owed $7,000 on a car that with a working transmission, was worth about $3,000. Less the $1,700 for a new trans, we owed $7,000 on a car worth $1,300.

After the transmission debacle, it was all down hill. Things have been breaking left and right with no warranty in sight, including most recently, the catalytic converter. It is as if Kia designed the warranty to end right before all the major malfunctions were scheduled to start.

This was the worst car we ever owned. After having the car for about 2 1/2 years, we can honestly say it SUCKS. The car is a collection of mismatched parts (Ford transmission, Mazda engine...YUCK!) that some half-baked engineers stuck together with a whole mess of duct tape and bailing wire!! 

As a special bonus, the car is horendously uncomfortable and short on storage space. Don't even THINK about trying to fit groceries and a baby stroller in the trunk. The cupholders are so miniscule they can barely hold a soda can, and even that's snug. Forget going large. (This may sound minor, but think about the shape of the seat fabric from all those spilled Snapple bottles.) The sound system is substandard...we blew out two speakers at nominal volume in the first year. Not that you'd want to blast anything on that tin can of a stereo anyway. And what's with the weird smell?

Please don't buy this car. It's not worth the bother.
