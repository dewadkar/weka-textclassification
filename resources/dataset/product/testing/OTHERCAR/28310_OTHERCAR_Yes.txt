            Ok, get yourself a pair of Dockers geek pocket pants and this camera is going with you anywhere you please.  I personally love the lens cover on auto-close; I know this way, the lens is protected while in my pocket.  The new batteries are 840mah but if you search you can find 950mah for $33 bucks each as well as a AC/DC charger for 32 bucks.  The only disappointing thing missing was the AC adapter to power the unit and charge the internal "CMOS" type battery while you work with the unit on your desktop machine; this is an option, but I found one at Best Buy for 25bucks and it it WELL WORTH IT.  With the 512mb CF card on 1024x768 you get over 1500 photos.  I found the regular canon battery can handle 3 hours and about 200 pix before the low battery light comes on.  I recommend 3 batteries for this little gem.  This thing has so many features and shooting options, the possibilities are endless.  I know the hardcore digi's out there balk at a tiny camera, but I can drop this in my pocket, with 3 batteries and never have to worry about bags, lenses, adapters, etc.  As Ferris Bueler once said.."If you have the means, I highly recommend picking up one of these".  One last thing, Canon makes a cool leather belt case for this and another belt case which holds extra CF, the camera and batteries.  The camera is small as a pack of Marlboro red's in a box, to the bags aren&#146t that big.  I know this sounds crazy, but I'd buy myself another one if I needed it and if I have to buy Birthday presents this year for family or friends, I will not hesitate to get them one of these.
