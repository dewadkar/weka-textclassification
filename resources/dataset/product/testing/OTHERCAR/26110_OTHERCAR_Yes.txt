            After researching it, I decided that this was the cheapest camera with the features that I liked.  My favorite is the solar power option on the LCD.  You can make it brighter than by battery if you are in sunlight, and really save on batteries.  I have had some problems with the electronics timing out, and then not waking back up.  This only happens once in about a hundred time-outs, so it is not a serious problem.  I talked with Epson, and they assured me that it was covered by the warranty, but I haven't been able to part with it long enough to send it in yet.  <br><br>
