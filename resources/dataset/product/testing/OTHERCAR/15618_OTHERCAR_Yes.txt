            Last year a sculptor friend brought his new camera into my shop. After two or three test shots, I knew I had to have it. A few months later when my husband asked me what I wanted for my anniversary, I didn't hesitate.
My husband is an engineer though and very methodical, so he said before we get you that camera make sure it's the one you want. I was pretty certain this was the one, but just to humor him, I started doing my research.
I'd like to say first, that my husband and I are both serious photographers. He has an older Olympus system and a Nikon F90s system. I have a Canon EOS620 system, an Olympus and a Casio Q1100. Okay, don't laugh. The Casio was pretty high tech when I bought it and I certainly got my money's worth. I shot a lot of headshots for ads with that camera with great results.
I wrote over three hundred e-mails to people like you at sites like this. In one day I got back 200+ responses and samples. I made my decision. There were several things to consider when I chose this camera. We travel a lot and a laptop is not practical. Changing out a memory stick is also not practical. While carrying floppies is a little cumbersome, they're easy to pack and transport and if I run out, they're cheap. This feature was precisely what critics of this camera did not like- this and the price. 
You really have to be careful when you read a negative critique. Sometimes it's not a really a product defect but just a user preference and one man's poison is another woman's candy. A few people said it was heavy. At two pounds, with battery, it weighs a lot less than my 35mm with it's 200mm zoom and flash. The batteries for the Mavica are long lasting, light and recharge quickly. It has built in Macro capabilities. My 35 requires a separate lens.The 91 is not a mega pixel camera, but it does have Zeiss lenses. I will hold it up to any mega pixel camera out there. Some said it was hard to use. Well, it's only hard if you've never used anything but a point and shoot. I'm long past that. I found it very user friendly and fine for beginners.
I am saving tons of money and time. Most of my work is portraiture. I'd shoot, process, print,scan, edit, and print again (the images from the Casio were not good enough to print, so I worked with my Canon) or save to disk if the client needed a digitized photo. Most of my clients are now looking for headshots for their brochures and websites. How easy is this now?
 Now I shoot, edit and save. (No, I don't print). I take them to a photo store and they print. I still haven't found a home printer with the quality I'm looking for at a price I can afford, but at least I am down to a two or three part process now instead of six. Best of all, floppies are cheap. 100 3.5 disks cost about $25.00 wholesale. They can be reused. At the fine resolution they will hold an average of 8 images. That's means 800 good images for my next trip. There is none of the insecurity that you have with film. if you don't like it you delete it and reshoot on the spot. The LCD screen on the 91 is big enough that you can REALLY see what you shot. I can use my 52mm lens attachments and filters from my Canon. It has a 14x zoom that really kicks B__T!
The other thing about this camera is that the price includes everything you need. There no ports to add, no SCSI to worry about. No extra software needed in order to download your pics. They are saved in jpeg or BMP format. You choose. I looked at some of the other popular cameras of comparable quality that started out with a $500 price tag, seemingly a savings of $300 to $500, depending where you buy, but then everything had to be added, cables, memory sticks, batteries. By the time you're done, you're up to the same $800. We paid $850 online. (List is $1099)
Okay the real cons are: I'm still not used to the flash. I tend to get a little too close and wash things out. It will not replace my 35. It is not nearly fast enough recycling if 
I'm shooting anything other that stills. It does not do well in low light conditions. If you can't see it and (sometimes even if you can)- the camera can't see it either. My 35 will sit on a tripod with a wide aperture and I KNOW I will have an image on my negative. This is not the case with  the Mavica. 
It is  slow- not a problem when you are doing a formal (or informal)portrait but if you wanted to catch your kid crossing the finish line- forget it! This is slightly more difficult than the point and shoot varieties. You might have to (Yikes) read the directions. And last of all, if I want a printed image of quality, I still can't do it myself. I have to  go to a photo processing store. This isn't the camera's fault, though. The printers just haven't caught up yet. 
The fact that most businesses use the Mavicas for their digital photos speaks very highly of the product. I have happily added it to my camera bag. And most days, it's the only one.<br><br>
