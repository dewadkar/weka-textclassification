            I bought my Sony Mavica FD-73 is the spring of 2000 to try to sell some of my hobbies in the internet. As soon as the battery was first charged this little camera has become a wonderful tool and playmate. The ease of use and compatibility has made this 'new toy' a true gem. From everything to neighborhood events to beautiful sunsets I take it everywhere with me. 

At first I felt a little over-whelmed with the buttons and menus but after playing with it and reviewing the owners manual I soon felt like a pro. Being able to immediately view the photos gives the photographer an often needed 'second chance'. 

Taking photos in the widely accepted JPEG format right onto a disk also makes this camera easy to convert disk images to photos or computer pics to use in a multiple range of applications. Anyone that has some picture software can plug in the disk and use the imiages. 

I love the features the camera offers. Even taking a camera in the dark, the flash is sufficient to produce a perfect photo. One picture I took was after dark of my son and his girlfriend in front of a blossoming cherry tree on prom night. The photo was perfect, perfect light on the kids and tree blossoms, the outside edges of the photo gently fading into the background. 

The only thing I would change about the Sony Mavica FD-73 would be the sensitivity of the viewing screen to not be so sensitive to fingerprints.

&quot;Buy the best you can afford&quot;, although selling for around $500 the price is well worth the expense and if treated right should justify its cost with photos and images in a very short time.
