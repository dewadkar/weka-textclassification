            We bought this vehicle used approximately 1 month ago.  It only had 35,000 miles on it and that really should've been a clue as to why it was available.  Appearance wise, it's great.  Looks like new.  The leather seats are very comfy and the CD player is a nice touch.  We're planning a long road trip this fall and are looking forward to it.  Now for the problems:  The wipers quit working after they've heated up.  A local dealer says this isn't covered by any recalls, however it is a safety issue.  We searched the internet and found a TSB covering windshield wiper motor failure and we've contacted Oldsmobile for their ruling.  Then the oxygen sensor/throttle position sensor went out.  Again, there is a TSB, but we ended up paying $300 for the repairs.  Oh, and did I mention, it appears this Bravada was in an accident, but this wasn't disclosed to us at the time we made the deal?  All in all, this is a nice truck; it's a big step up from the '92 Explorer we traded.<br><br>
