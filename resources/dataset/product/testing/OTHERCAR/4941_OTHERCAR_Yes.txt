            I bought the Isuzu pickup new in 1989.  The biggest reason was for the gas mileage.  I was working for a nursing agency and a lot of the work was out of town.  I do not know a lot of technical language to use being a woman I just know what works and what doesn't

The Isuzu was ideal for the gas mileage.  30 miles per gallon on the open road and around 20 for in city driving.  It was not fancy just your standard 4 cylinder motor  with a 5 speed stick shift.  

The interior was adequate and being a small truck not that roomy.  It held two with no problem. Going  back and forth to Columbia to work was a 100 mile trip and I drove this 3 or 4 times a week.  

The gear shift always sounded like it hesitated to go into 5 gear.  I was told that this was common for the trucks so I got used to the sounds.  Taking the hills felt like it didn't have enough get up and go but it would finally make it to the top going down was no problem. 

The seat belts were uncomfortable to wear always riding up around the neck.  The truck did not have power steering and parking was always a major undertaking.  I said then that I would never again buy a vehicle without power steering. If the ashtray was in the out position it always bumped into the drivers knee.

When I remarried in 1991 my step son had cancer and had to go to Bethesda Maryland every three weeks.  This truck made every trip about a 12 hour drive.  It was not a comfortable drive the seats were not that padded and not made for any great comfort on long trips.

The only time the truck was repaired was when the O2 sensor light came on and had to be reset, and the water pump had to be replaced in 1996.The body of the truck was outstanding, no rust and remained in good condition until it was sold.

I drove the truck until 1999 when we got a another new vehicle. By this time it had 180.000 miles on it and was burning oil(needed seals)but it never failed to crank. 

We sold the truck outright for 1500 dollars and the man that bought it replaced the seals and resold it, the last I heard it was still going strong. 

I must say for a cheap little truck I never expected to get the service from  it that we did.  

I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for an inexpensive reliable truck. <br><br>
