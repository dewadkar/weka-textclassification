            So I asked for a digital camera for Christmas. On my Amazon.com wish list was the shiny new digital elph, the cute little pocket sized new entrant by Canon.  So on Christmas day, boy was I disappointed when I found the coolpix 800 instead. It's chunky appearnace, and flimsy plastic body did not inspire confidence. Early on I was dismissive, now I am thrilled.

The ugly body hides a powerful professional camera.  Nikon has long been the professional's choice for SLR cameras, and it has successfully carried that distinction into top of the line digitals. With the CoolPix 800, it tries to enter the consumer market with this low priced alternative. As far as I can tell, all they sacrificed is in the camera body.  Otherwise, the features are great, bringing all the benefits of their professional models to the amateur market.

With the ability to control all aspects of the picture (shutter speed, aperture, exposure length, even film speed), this gives the amateur photographer instant gratification when trying new techniques.

For those of the point and shoot persuasion, the camera is smart enough to set the settings for you, making anyone a pro.  This is especialyl nice for night shots, where if you turn the flash off, the camera can simulate high speed film, letting you take amazing night time shots previous unachievable by the amateur.

Easy access to controls makes usage a breeze.

Also, being compatible with the rest of the nikon line, lens attachments for future expansion are available.

All in all, once you get past the superficial physical deficiencies, the Nikon 800 is one of the best cameras you can get for the money.
