            I've owned my Trooper for almost 2 years and I've really been impressed with the engine and the Torque On Demand four wheel drive system.  In rain, sleet, and snow the Trooper feels very sure-footed.  I especially like that the TOD system allows the driver to keep the truck in 4WD regardless of road conditions which can be helpful in patchy ice conditions.    My last 4x4 had to be shifted into 2WD on dry pavement and for most of those in between conditions, it had to be left in 2WD.  Unfortunately, in 4WD mode, the Trooper goes from bad gas mileage to worse.

I've never had my Trooper off road unless you count my driveway last winter.  I was the only person on my block last winter that didn't shovel the foot of snow out of the driveway.  In low range, I thought the Trooper was unstoppable in snow.  It even tackled the mound in front of the driveway left by the city snow plow.

Most of the time, a Trooper will be on the roads, and I've always the thought my Trooper rode well on the highway.  It does have some pretty good body lean in corners, but it rides comfortably enough.  I like that it has plenty of room to carry several friends and still has plenty of room to haul luggage, equipment, gear, etc.
