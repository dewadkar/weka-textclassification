            The Golf/GTI is a utilitarian two-box hatchback at heart, with wheels placed toward the corners of the car, short overhangs, and a near-vertical rear hatch maximizing space utilization. But the little VW still has its own style. Thinner roof pillars give it a leaner look than the previous version, and a more-sloping hood line adds sporty rakishness. The front light treatment is the car's most interesting aspect. On each side, the headlights, foglamps, and turn signals are all placed behind a clear polycarbonate cover. Not only does this protect them from damage, it gives the GTI and Golf a unique, high-tech look. The standard Volkswagen &quot;trolley pole&quot; antenna adds a bit of whimsy, making the car look like a large radio-controlled model. 

You don't like hatchbacks? OK, then try to get a 17-inch computer monitor box into the trunk of a sedan. Oops.... And, although some fastback hatchback coupes may hold that heavy box, the liftover can be back-annoyingly high. No problem in the GTI, or any other Golf. A low liftover, large opening, and plenty of room inside are reminders of the good characteristics of the hatchback design. And the rear seat not only is split 60/40 to fold down, but its cushions flip up SUV-style for a flat cargo area. One reason that hatchbacks lost favor in the US is that many were low- budget, uncomfortable econoboxes. Not the Golf. Even the entry-level GL models are comfortably-appointed, quiet, and solidly-constructed. With its high equipment level, and leather and wood trim, the GTI GLX is closer to its upscale Audi cousins than to an old Beetle. Its supportive front bucket seats have height-adjustable cushions. The steering wheel is adjustable for both tilt and reach, so an optimum position is available to all drivers. Instruments and controls are placed well. Seemingly minor details improve life with the GTI - a visor above the rearview mirror can keep the sun out of the driver's eyes at critical times. The rear seat is roomy enough for medium-sized people for moderate distances, and, as mentioned, converts to cargo storage quickly and easily. Need comfort and versatility to go with fun? Look no further.
