            The 2003 Malibu from Chevy is a comfortable, pleasant all around basic transportation. If your looking for a car that has the roominess to transport 5 and a bunch of luggage for a modest price then the malibu certainly performs well. 

It has a clean exterior styling and an interior that is acceptable basic transportation. It comes well loaded with body panels of two-sided galvanized steel and intergrated body moldings that are body-color. 

It has the standard 5-mph front bumper and daytime running lights with automatic exterior turn on. There is a power door lockout protection feature built into the alarm system and dual power, body-color outside mirrors.

In terms of safety there are the side-door beams and steel safety cage construction  which we have all come to expect. 

It also comes standard with variable intermittent wipers.

I found the engine to be acceptable and the handling and breaking were ok as well. 

I think the build quality and fit and finish are obviously not the best in the world but from the point of view of a lower price family sedan, you had better not come to the dealer looking for a Rolls or something.

There are many cars to choose from in this segement but I think all of them are more expensive, this is the class leader in terms of price. You can spend 6000 more on an accord and get a better quality machine, but you have spent 6000 more. 

The malibu comes with the 3100 V6 engine which is a good solid performing engine, that goes and goes. no problems at all. It has four wheel independant suspension, which is comfortable soft, pleasant ride, not too firm , not too soft.

There is a redesign, coming in the near future for the malibu 2004, so the 2003 may become an even better bargain as the dealers need to unload. I think that you should not have too many problems with this GM car as it is built on one of GM's most stable platforms and engines. As with virtually all north american car products you will pay less upfront, but may end up with some repairs along the way.

For those of you worried about repairs, They have a road side assistance plan that includes 24-Hour Roadside assistance and courtesy transportation.

For mid size basic transportation at low prices the malibu can't be beat.
