            The Dodge Ram trucks, as remodeled in 1994, recreated an industry.  When the new Ram debuted, it once again became stylish to own and drive a truck.  The Dodge Ram is the quintessential truck. It carries, it pulls, it pushes, it goes over anything and through everything else.  The new Dodge Ram is untouchable.  I don't own one, my dad does, and I wish I did.  His truck is a 1500 SLT Quad Cab Short Box, with a 5.9L (360 cid) V-8, leather interior, Infinity Gold Sound System, and 4WD.

This truck is the best looking truck out there, and it is mechanically indestructible (believe me, you don't want to know what we've done to this truck).  The Dodge Ram is not the best at cornering or braking, the new for '99 Chevy/GMC has that crown, but the Dodge has a much nicer interior and has the wonderful advantage of an engine that has been around since the 60's.  Because of this, it makes good power, and is dirt-cheap to service (try that with the new all-aluminum GM motor, or the modular SOHC Fords).  The Dodge is for people who want to drive a truck and know that they are driving a truck.  I used to work at a Ford dealership, and of all the F-Series trucks I drove, none of them ever made me smile (OK, the SVT Lightning did, but those don't even have 4WD).  Every time I drive my dad's Dodge, I get a grin that stretches from one ear to the other, as I watch other drivers' eyes get big when they see the big-rig chrome grille in their mirrors.<br><br>
