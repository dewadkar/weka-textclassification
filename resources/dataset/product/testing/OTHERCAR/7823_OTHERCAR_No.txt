            This will be a short one, but, don't ever wreck this car.  I will never own another Saturn after my accident in this one.  I lost control of my Saturn on admittedly rather slick pavement, BUT, when I was hit (by another Saturn, same make and model) that's where it went down hill.  First of all, when I lost control I drove the driver's side front bumper into the concrete median, the airbag didn't deploy at 55 mph.  When I came to a stop, the Saturn that hit me, hit me HEAD ON to my passenger side front door and her airbag also didn't deploy, at 55 mph.  

Not only that but Saturn is always raving about their side impact door beams but in this collision, since the Saturn front end is so low, the impact caused the side impact door beam to stay intact but the rest of the passenger door UNDER the beam was pushed all the way into the passenger compartment inches away from my arm, while I was in the drivers seat. The police told me that had I had a passenger in my car at the time they surely would have been seriously injured if not killed.

I was perfectly happy with this car until the accident but that one night has scared me into never buying another Saturn again.
