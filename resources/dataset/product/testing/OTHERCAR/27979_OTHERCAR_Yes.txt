            I love my present 1991 Pickup, though it's well past time to move on to a new one.  After lots of research on options, I decided on the &quot;perfect&quot; truck for me-- and set out to order it.  Being able to order exactly what I wanted made the difference in the decision to buy another used truck or to go ahead and buy a new one.

However, it is very hard to order a new Toyota with a custom configuration.  According to the dealer, Toyota's factory in Fremont, CA only makes 25 customer-configured trucks per month.

Additionally, those trucks which are ordered but not built do not get queued for the next month-- the orders are cancelled.  This means that it's important to have your dealer re-check the status immediately after the month's production has been completed just in case you, like me, are one of the lucky ones whose orders are cancelled.

The short story is that it's been 70 days and I'm still waiting for my truck.

UPDATE

It finally arrived!  77 days of waiting, but it's here.  Alas, they got the interior color wrong-- but rather than waiting another 45 days for a resubmitted order and leaving the dealer with my bizarre configuration to unload I decided to just take it.

My guess is that the dealer mis-ordered it during one of the resubmissions.  Although the dealer was quite straightforward with me, his attention to detail left something to be desired.  Don't be afraid to see the actual order printout and verify each option-- you want the car you ordered and the dealer doesn't want to sell your wierded-out car so double-checking works well for everyone.

If anyone from Toyota is reading this-- GIVE THE DEALERS THE OPTION TO AUTOMATICALLY RESUBMIT AN ORDER AFTER EACH MONTH'S PRODUCTION.  Sorry to yell, it's just so stupid that this doesn't exist.  I signed a 90-day contract, do they think I'm going to give up my deposit and just go away?

It would also be nice to embrace the Internet and allow people to submit configurations they would like to buy online.  I suspect by giving people a first, second, and third choice and picking the most popular for production Toyota could learn a lot about the marketplace and give people cars they want rather than relying on the salespeople to sell what they decide to produce.  Ford seems to be going this way, and who knows in 10 years when my new Toyota is as beaten and bedraggled as my old one maybe this will be the case.

Hey, I can dream.<br><br>
