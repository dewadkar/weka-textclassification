            Not too long ago, a friend of mine was in some deep trouble at work. Her boss wanted a website, and he wanted it fast. Little did he know that Terry didn't know the first thing about building websites and she didn't have the time to learn it as fast as she needed to.

So I made it for her. Logo, formatting, buttons --- nothing special, but enough to make the boss happy, thereby making Terry very, very happy. &quot;I'm going to buy you something special,&quot; she kept promising me. Eh. I didn't want anything. She was in a bind and I was glad to help her out.

Little did I know how true  &quot;A friend in need is a friend indeed&quot; would turn out. After giving it a lot of thought, Terry (aka &quot;the friend in need&quot;) also proved herself to be a friend indeed. As a special thank you gift, she bought me a Sony Mavica FD91.

What a camera! I don't know much about photography, but just looking over the features the FD91 offers, I can see how much I have to learn. But as a beginner, I also have no problem in taking quality digital images. Here's the non-photographer's view of the Mavica FD-91 camera:

The Mavica FD-91 is big  - especially for a digital. While some digitals are small as a pack of cigarettes, the FD-91 is 5.5 inches in length and have a guesstimate weight of around 2 pounds. The body isn't the only part of the camera that's big: because the FD-91 offers automatic, zoom, and manual focus, the lens is especially prominent. It's a love-hate situation - I love playing with different kinds of shots, but dislike hefting this big boy around.

One of the most distinctive features of any Mavica digital camera is that it uses floppy disks to store images. This has some wonderful advantages: no need to run cables from computer to camera to download pictures; they're compatible with Macintosh and PC computers; and floppies can be convenient, inexpensive storage devices.

The negative side is that floppy disks have limited capacity (only 1.44 MB) and are good for only short-term use. Don't expect a floppy to provide long-term storage. They're way too delicate. Several times I was engrossed in shooting a group of pictures, only to be hit with the &quot;Disk Full&quot; warning in my LCD panel. At other times, I was unable to retrieve an image I really wanted because the data had become corrupt somehow. 

On the other hand,  floppies are cheap and easy to pack along with the other equipment.  If someone wants a copy of a shot I just took, it's a simple process to insert another floppy and make a copy right there. No need to hook the camera up to a computer and do a long song and dance with software.

In many ways, the Mavica FD-91 has all the features you would expect from any quality camera: an automatic flash, zoom and focus capabilities -- even a receptacle for your tripod. You can adjust the white balance and choose between aperature or shutter priority.

The rest is sheer computer magic. This camera records small mpeg movies with sound, has an LCD pad which displays a welter of programming options: clock set, beep on or off, disk formatting, flash level, image size and quality, and battery life and disk capacity. The LCD also displays immediate playback (and deletion) of images. Now my camera-shy friends let me take their pictures because they know they'll have complete control over which images stay and which get deleted.

I've used other digital cameras and find that the Mavica FD-91 has a lot more pluses than it does minuses. The images are as good as any amateur like myself can expect. Not only does the camera have auto-focus, it also has a &quot;steady hands&quot; feature, which eliminates unnecessary camera movements that could mess up a shot. This is especially useful if you're trying to capture a movie, or taking a long time in lining up a shot.

This camera has a range of options that I haven't mentioned, only because I don't know about them (yet.) I have a lot to learn about photography, and learning on something like a Mavica FD-91 is as good as I can get -- doubly so, since I don't worry about film expenses every time I take a shot.

Terry? she learned to make her own web pages, so it looks like I won't be getting any other high-end equipment for a while.<br><br>
