            We live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and my family has bought three Subarus to this date.  Our first was the 4WD Turbo GL-10 Wagon, second was the Legacy Wagon and now we only have the 4WD Legacy Turbo Sedan.  And let me tell you, this little sedan has been through battles.  It has 136,000km on it and I am sure it can last through many more kilometers.  My first Subaru, the GL-10 4WD Turbo Wagon finally gave in at 115,000km.  However, we drove that wagon around the United States three times.  From Death Valley, to the Rocky Mountains, to the Salt Lake Flats, to the Grand Canyon and many more.  We pushed that wagon to the max and it never gave in.  Subaru makes the most durable cars in the world.  My current Subaru Legacy Turbo sedan has brought me to my school at the University of South Dakota back and forth twice and back and forth to Memphis, Tennessee six times.  The long, harsh and bitter winters are no match for my Subaru.  However, one criticism about the Subaru is its poor electrical system and its poorly constructed. But I have read that these poor qualities only existed before the 1993 models.  I can always rely on my Subaru to get me to my destination safely.<br><br>
