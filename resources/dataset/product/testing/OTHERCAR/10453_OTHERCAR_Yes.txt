            It's the Honda thing - great quality, bland style, not offensive to anyone. Not a looker, a good performer if you like the high pitch sound of its V-Tech engine at ultra high RPM. Not the best performer, but for the price, nobody should complain. Love the turbo MR-2 far better than the GS-R. But MR-2 is only good for fun. I think my Miata got more space than MR-2! Basically GS-R is a Civic with better performance. I got it for 2 years with absolutely no quality problem. The stick shift isn't as precise as Celica, but it works well once you get used to it. But it got stolen. So I got a stick shift Maxima SE, similar deal like the GS-R, good all around with decent performance, but not the best. 

Tested 2002 Type-S (GS-R replacement). This is a solid upgrade from GSR, more sophisticated, quieter, far better performance, and far better stick shift too. Just better all around! Also tried "the ultimate driving machine" brand new 3 series. What a joke! They just suck! Type-S out performs all these slow and dumb 3 series (not the M3 I guess) hands down. But, beemer got the look. There's no question there. Like Volvo and Saab. Their "turbo" engine doesn't do anything at all. Just plain slow and boring. Go for the new type-S if you love GS-R.

So I now switch to motorcyle for performance instead :)
