            I'm now only six payments (out of 60) from 'owning' my Protege and I thought I'd update my review.  My Mazda is still going strong.  The car now has 98,000 miles on it and it's been extremely reliable and inexpensive to own.  Since my last update, the only problem above normal wear and tear is a cracked exhaust manifold.  I'm not sure what it would cost to fix at the dealer (probably around $500), but I can get the parts for $220 and do it myself.  Apparently, this model Protege is KNOWN for this manifold problem.  It happens between 70 and 90 thousand miles on average, so it's not a warranty item.  I'm at the stage of ownership with this vehicle where I'm going to give it a 100,000 mile makeover.  I'm still running on the original timing belt, as well as all original hoses and exterior belts.  I'm going to bite the bullet and replace all those belts and hoses soon to avoid any unanticipated highway failures.  I have run this car as hard as any I've ever owned and it has held up extremely well.

I love the gas mileage (average 33 mpg overall), remote fuel and trunk release, power accessories, cruise control, 60/40 seats.  In fact, there are precious few things I dislike about the car.  It wouldn't have killed Mazda to make the sheet metal a little thicker (dings easily).  I had the door locks replaced on both doors (under warranty) because they jammed.  First the driver's door (couldn't get the key into the lock), so I just unlocked from passenger's side until it too jammed.  The CD player never worked right, and stopped working completely within the first 10k miles.  Mazda replaced it free under warranty at about 40k (which is when I first complained about it) and it works fine.  The front brake pads have also been replaced (normal maintenance).  I just replaced the factory battery (out of warranty).  I put Mobil One oil in it at 500 miles and every few thousand thereafter.  The car uses no oil between changes.  

Like almost every other review you read about this car, I would have preferred the ES model (bigger engine), but the dealer didn't have any in stock at the time and it wasn't a huge deal to me.  I do push this puppy hard, am not afraid to run up the RPM's (my wife gets REAL nervous at 5000 rpm) which is often necessary to merge with traffic.  Runs great at 80 MPH, and I have 'tested' it up to nearly 100 (kids don't try this at home).
