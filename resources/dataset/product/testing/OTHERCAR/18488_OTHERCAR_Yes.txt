            What a fabulous piece of machinery.  The Saab 9000 is surely one of the safest, slickest and sweetest cars on the roads these days.  First of all, this vehicle is fully equipped with an ABS/TCS system for those snowy winter days.  It comes with front-wheel drive, which serves to be highly useful on sleet or ice.  A/C, child locks and a great sound system are also part of the package. I love this car! 

The Saab 9000's ride is one of quiet tranquility.  It is as if the world is streaming by outside the windows of this luxurious automobile. The driver and passenger both enjoy comfortable heated seats, sturdy cupholders and spacious leg room.  The backseat can comfortably fit four people across, making long family excursions safe and convenient. This car definitely is a bang for the buck. <br><br>
