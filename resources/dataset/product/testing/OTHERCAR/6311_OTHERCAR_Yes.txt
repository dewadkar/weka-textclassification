            I saw this car and fell in love!!A friend from work had just bought an Avenger and I knew this was the car for me. 

The look was sleek and sporty, yet it was not the tiny little car that made me feel like a sardine. I was still in college at the time and knew I couldn't afford it, but I knew that I HAD TO HAVE THIS CAR!!

I graduated college and it was time for a new car! My dad is friends with a dealer who had a car that his wife bought and wanted to sell, so I got the car from him at a really good price...one that could not be passed up!

I got a white 96 Avenger ES, fully loaded, 6 cylinder for in 1996 for only $14, 000. It had barely 10,000 miles in Nov when I bought her. I purchased the extended warranty and was off!

I have had very minor problems with my car in the 3.5 years I have had her! There was a recall on a part which was immediately taken care of when brought in and there was a short that had developed in the radio. I recently had my window get stuck, but have been unable to get there to have it checked out. The dealer pays my deductible according to my warranty, so these minor repairs do not cost me anything. 

The other things that have gone wrong with my car are due to other extenuating circumstances. The people who changed my oil sprayed my engine when changing it and I had to have my engine cleaned (at their expense). I am also hard on brakes and have taken 2 or 3 trips to MIDAS! Thank god they have lifetime warranties. I have hit a pothole and had my rim bent as well as other flats due to road conditions and poor maintainence I have on the car. White cars also get dirty VERY easily!!
