               I test drove a 98 C/K1500 with 4-wheel drive, V6, 5 speed manual, tape deck, extended cab, cloth seats, and 60/40 split bench with center armrest and power locks and windows. What surprised me first of all was that I was able to find a Chevy with all the creature comforts but with a minimalist drivetrain, something that's darn near impossible to locate nowadays. V6/5speed F150's are out there, but I guarentee most of them will have cheap looking vinyl seats without a built in armrest and most that I've seen come without even a tape deck. But as I mentioned this Chevy caught my eye because It had an economical drive train combined with a very well equipped interior, which seems rare in the pickup market nowadays.

Handling: Too tipsy for my taste. The F150 I've driven was a 4x4 with off-road package that sat even higher than this truck, but the F series felt way more secure and planted through the curves. The Chevy is not the truck I'd want to be in when I misjudge a fast curve and enter at too high a speed. However the Chevy did track very well in a straight line, seemingly a charecteristic of all GM full sized trucks. The steering had a little more weight to it than the F-series, which I liked.

Powertrain and acceleration: I've always liked Chevy's full sized truck manual transmissions. They seem to me to to have short and precise throws. Clutch travel though seemed way too long for even a truck. I had to nearly lift my whole leg up to let out the clutch every time I shifted.
The 200 horsepower V6, rated at 15 city and 19 highway,  was smooth and had a growl to it that suprised me. At first it sounded kinda like the 5.0. Low end torque is great, but don't let yourself get caught in the wrong gear. Too high and it gets very course and runs out of steam. Too low and it lugs. Keep it between 3 and 5000 rpm and it works well. But torque and power aren't exactly available all across the rev range. For that effortless, always available grunt you should think 350/

Interior/Comfort: I would have liked seat height adjustment. No matter how I positioned the seat I felt like I was sitting on the truck, not in it. I found I was unable to get very comfortable, in part because of that clutch.  If I sat close enough to reach everything easily I had to raise my leg uncomfortably high to let out the clutch. IF I sat far enough back so that I didn't need to do that I had trouble reaching the wheel. Everything is positioned high and clearly marked, and the transfer case is manual, not electronic, a more reliable setup but not exactly the untlra convenient set- it-and-forget-it type system that many who go for 4x4's simply for all weather capabilities prefer. I hear the electronic 4x4 system in the 99's works well. With all windows closed all you can hear is a little wind noise, no creaks and rattles.
 The headrests were extensions of the seat, not the adjustable type, and they were not nearly high enough to protect against whiplash in a rear end collisions. They either need to be made higher or Chevy needs to make them the adjustable type, but my 95 Ranger regular cab offers much better protection and goes higher than the top of my head.

The rear seat was a bit more comfy than the other models I've been in but not much.
The radio is fine if quality sound isn't a priority and you just want to play music and tapes. But sound isn't very deep or powerful. I would augment the sound system.
All in all a very good but not exceptional truck. If I can find a similarly equipped  F series that will be my first choice.<br><br>
