            This was my first vehicle that I bought Brand new.  I was looking for something that not only was comfortable, but looked nice too.  The design of the front end of it stands out, when someone sees it coming they know that they are looking at one powerful truck.  It may not be the fastest vehicle out there but when &quot;speedy&quot; gets stuck they look for a Dodge that won't get stuck and pull them out of almost anything.  
If you are someone looking for a truck to customize there is so much you can do to one of these.  If you are an off-roader you can lift this baby up, add a winch, a roll bar, fog lights and with that V8 Magnum and 4 wheel drive and you can go anywhere.  Or if you wish they also look good lowered, Drop it give it a good audio system and you'll turn a lot of heads.  This Bad boy fits any personality.  Even if you have a family, get yourself a Quad Cab and pull that camper anywhere you want.
