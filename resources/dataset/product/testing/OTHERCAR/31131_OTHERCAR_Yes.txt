            I considered several used Boxsters before buying a used 911 C2.  Honestly, I suspect most people who compare the two would select the Boxster.  I did not - here's why.

THE CARS AND PRICES:  1997 - 1998 Boxsters are selling at prices similar to 1990 - 1993 911's - $30,000 - $35,000.  There will be some higher and some lower - but that's about the average range.

The Boxster:  A two seat convertible, water-cooled, 201 HP engine mounted mid-ship, rear wheel drive.

The 911 C2:  A four seat (2+2) Coupe, Convertible, or Targa (removable semi-soft top), air cooled, 247 HP rear mounted engine, rear wheel and all wheel drive.

Both cars come with standard ABS, 5 speed transmission, 16 inch wheels, AC and the typical power operated accessories.  Both cars have similar available options including 17 or 18 inch wheels, tiptronic (automatic) transmission, and interior upgrades for stereo and seating surface materials.  The 911 offers the early version of Porsches all wheel drive system which has received mixed reviews as an option.

WHAT'S TO LIKE:

BOXSTER:  This is the easier car to own and drive.  It's current technology in that it is water cooled (the way of all new Porsches).  The mid engine configuration makes the car handle better for the spirited - but untrained driver.  The suspension will give a smoother, more comfortable ride.  The engine is quieter and smoother feeling than the 911.  So far - the Boxster has shown no major mechanical flaws and appears to be very reliable.  In addition - due to age difference - the Boxster should be easier to use as collateral for an auto loan.  Many banks will be reluctant to lend money on 10 year old cars (even though older 911's depreciate very slowly).  Finally - you're likely to find a gently driven Boxster that was owned by a mature owner.  Some may even be daily drivers that may have lower than average prices.

911 C2:  The early C2 (1990 - 1994 911 a/k/a 964) is almost none of the above.  Its the old air cooled engine mounted behind the rear wheels which makes it tricky to drive hard (and dangerous for the foolhardy).  It rides rougher, its louder, and the 1990 and 1991 C2s had some expensive repair histories.  SO WHY BUY IT?  It is really fun to drive.  It will appeal to many prior 911 owners who will prefer the excitement of the old breed Porsche.  I've driven both cars and its hard to specifically explain the 911 driving experience.  Its not a better car to drive - but it offers a kind of thrill that the early Boxsters just could not match.  Part is due to the more powerful engine (you'll have to buy a Boxster S to get similar power).  Part of its due to the fact that the 911 requires more driving input.  In other words - if you really love to drive - the 911 will provide more opportunity to do what you love.  The 911 is a harder car to tame.  If you get a thrill from a challenge - the thrill should last longer with a 911.  

One more point - the 911 will allow you to include your young (or small) family in the driving experience.  The back seats will accommodate children and petite women through about 5' 4".  That was a must for me because my wife still insist that our grade school age son ride in the back seat only (of any car).  The Boxster will require that any family larger than two will always exclude someone from the fun.  Finally, if you want a coupe, a Targa, or all wheel drive the Boxster is not an option (though they do have available hard tops).

Its easier to say that these two cars are different than it is to pick one as better.  If you are going to own only one car for all year driving where it snows - better find a early C4 (all wheel drive).  If you want a Sunday driver/fair weather date car - I'd pick the Boxster.  In this group - I'd have to say the Boxster is the best all around car (even though its not the one I personally prefer).  If you are an auto addict looking for a car that seems to thrill you like you're driving it for the first time every time you drive it - consider the 911 C2.  But be careful and have any Porsche checked by a trusted PORSCHE mechanic.  Porsches aren't cheap to fix and a Porsche specialist is most likely to know what to look for on any particular model. 

Though fairly expensive to buy - Porsches can be a bit of a bargain.  The older cars hold value amazingly well - so the largest expense for many cars (depreciation), can be reduced or - occasionally - eliminated.  You will see 20 year old Porsches selling for $10 - $15,000.  That creates a very solid floor for the value of cars half that age.  

A final hint.  If you live in the mid-west - don't go shopping for a Porsche in the sun belts.  There's no reason.  Many mid-west Porsches are fair weather drivers so cars driven 3 - 5000 miles per year are not uncommon.  Fair weather cars often have more use/abuse as daily drivers.  Also, since 1978 Porsches (at least 911s) have been made with galvanized body panels.  These cars have held up quite well (but always check for rust/damage).  Porsche prices are condition sensitive.  Rough cars may be cheap to buy - but won't be cheap to keep.
