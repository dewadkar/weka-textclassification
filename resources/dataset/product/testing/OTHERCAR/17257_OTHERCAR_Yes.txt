            I recently purchased 1999 Dodge Intrepid ES, after having my eye on it for about 3 months. This car had every option available and yes I use the majority of the high tech features. I over 6' tall and the car is very accommodating to my height, even when sitting for extended period during my long commute in DC traffic. The mileage for me is around 25 mpg, and that is about what I expected it to be. The sound system while a premium sound system could be improved, the sound problem could be due to the cab forward design, as I had a similar problem in my Chrysler Cirrus.The car has a very good trunk space and the rear seats due accommodate large adults, even when the two front seats are pushed back as far as they go. The cars handling is good, but not great. I would have expected more control when handling the curves at high speeds, aging this could be a problem with me, since I have always driven sub-compact cars and I have not gotten used to driving a full size car. The overall appearance of the vehicle is stylish and females dig it. The overall performance of the car is good, but I thought I would have more pickup power from a dead stop, though it is satisfactory, you will not be blowing by anybody at the stop lights. This is the perfect car for young family man or woman, he can not fathom the idea of a minivan and thinks Sport Utility Vehicles are over priced and over hyped.<br><br>
