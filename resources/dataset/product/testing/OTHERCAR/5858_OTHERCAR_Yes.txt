            I have had my eye on the TL for a few years. I finally got some money to buy it. This is a great looking car with a strong engine. It is very roomy inside with great seats. Here are the Pros for this car.

3.2 liter engine delivers POWER. You can cruise at 85 MPH without a problem. The body is solid with minimal noise from the wind or engine. Most cars are left behind you when the light turns green at a stoplight. It is easy to go fast�be careful.

The seats are excellent. They have a great fit to the body and high quality leather. 

It is roomy in the back even for taller people.

The car�s exterior style is great and with another $2K you can get a spoiler and ground effects package that makes it look even better.

100K miles no tune up. You still need to get the oil changed though.

There are no options for this car, everything is included. They only option is for the navigation system.

The inside of the car is also stylish with everything logically placed. There is a slight cheapness to some of the items inside but you are buying an entry-level luxury car, not a BMW.

Although I love this car there are a few things I would do to improve it.

Single disk CD player. The Honda has an in-dash six disk CD player for its Accord EX. I think Acura should at least keep-up with it�s lower end sister models.

The style is too close to the Honda Accord.

No memory for the power seats.

Manual steering adjustment that only adjusts up and down.

There is no cigarette lighter or ashtray. There are two power adaptors, which is great. If you smoke you may want another car.

My overall review for this car is a 9 out of 10. It is a great car for this price range. Acura has finally caught up with demand and you do not have to order the car. Also you can pay below the MSRP. I think the 2001 model is the last year for this style and they will soon unveil an updated model. I think they are going to introduce the 3.2 TL-s that increases the HP by about 25 horses. I am sure they will raise the price for the upgrades for the next model.
