            The Fuji FinePix 1300 takes great photos, even indoors! There are lots of cameras now that offer higher resolution photos, but very few that I've seen can match the image quality and ease of operation of this little gem! I use mine to take eBay photos all the time, and it works extremely well in all conditions, even very dim lighting.

I suggest buying several accessories: a 32MB or 64MB smart media card, a soft case, a Zio smart media reader, and some NiMH rechargeable batteries.

The only drawbacks of the camera are minor. A lens protector would have been nice and the LCD viewfinder could be a little easier to read in some conditions.

You might also consider the FinePix 1400, a very similar camera with a nice optical zoom lens (with protector, I think). I've seen the 1300 going for $130 recently and the 1400 for $160.

I highly recommend this camera if you don't need images larger than 1280 by 960.
