            Hi my name is Eric and I'm writing this to tell you why the Honda Civic Hatchback is one of the best car's on the market. First of all I purchased a 1999 Honda Civic Hatchback about 6 months ago.  I bought the car mainly on looks and also for the safety. I have added many things to it since such as rims and a competition winning sound system and I'm very very pleased with this car. This car has great handling, good gas mileage, Low Emission Vehicle, and a very good price. The way I can explain what it is like to drive this vehicle would be that it has pin point handling and with the right modifications very very good acceleration. This also brings me to another reason why I chose this car out of all of the others. This car was built to be modified and it is one of the biggest modification type cars out there today. You'll find all kinds of things to do to this car. One more thing I'd like to add. My Honda Civic Hatchback was totaled about a month ago. If this car wasn't equipped with the safety features it came with then I probably wouldn't be here today which is another reason why this is a good car. Thanks for your time!<br><br>
