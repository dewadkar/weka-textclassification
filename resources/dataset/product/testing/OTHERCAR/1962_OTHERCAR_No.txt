            This is an awesome car to drive; 222 horsepower that eat up the corners!  The ride is comfortable, but tends to &quot;bounce&quot; along the seams on some concrete highways. The acceleration and shifting are great along with the basic sound system.  We like the the keyless entry and built-in programmable home security features. A hot looking car! 

However...  I've had the car since the beginning of November and with the cold weather in Minnesota there are some transmission problems.  While the car starts readily in cold weather, unless it is warmed up (remember the 60's and 70's when that was a prerequisite?), it stalls when put into gear.  This has happened repeatedly even when in a garage.  Nissan has run many diagnostic tests and replaced several parts, but the problem continues.  As stated in the owner's manual we are using high octane (91+) gasoline which the Nissan &quot;team of experts&quot; recommended and said would solve the problem.  

We are now waiting for the regional service manager to arrive in the Mpls./St. Paul area to determine what the problem is.  We were told by the local service manager that we may be told that we need to use a particular brand of gasoline and that the fault lies with our local refinery!  Excuse me, shouldn't a car be built to handle many &quot;brands&quot; of gas?  And can one be assured that the recommended brand is always available in every city one goes to?  

We are very frustrated since we are making a lease payment for less than perfect new car! (It was in the shop for 7 days after the first 10 days we had it.) 

It's hard to know if I should recommend this car to a friend; other than the stalling problem, it's a really great car and I would be hard pressed to find a subsitute.
