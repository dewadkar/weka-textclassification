            After my old, old Accord finally succumbed to its 180,000 miles I set out to buy my first new car.  I was looking for a reasonably-priced, reliable, fuel-efficient 4-door sedan.  As an outdoorsmen, I took a good hard look at Subaru.  The sexy Outback Sport and Impreza models lured me in and wouldn&#146t let go with their All-Wheel-Drive and boxer-engine power.   I thought I was ready to suck it up and plunk down 20 large for a nice blue granola-wagon....but....but...then I came to my senses....19 MPG in the city?  Several Impreza wagon owners I spoke to said the same thing &#147fun to drive, love the AWD, but hate the gas mileage&#148.   Plus, while the AWD is great to have in the winter...let&#146s get real, even here in Upstate NY how much would I really use it?   Not enough to justify paying more for a Subaru.   

So now it was down to the standards in entry-level sedans &#150 Civic, Corolla, Sentra and Elantra.    I never really looked at the Sentra because I didn&#146t like its styling.  The new Corolla design is too thin.  I sat in one and felt cramped.  The Elantra is a good deal, but it was bland and only got average gas mileage.   I thought about the Prius or the Civic Hybrid but didn&#146t think their little hybrid engines would take to kindly to me placing a canoe on top.   That leaves the Civic &#150 &#147the&#148 small sedan industry standard.   I liked the styling, gas mileage (EPA 30, 39), and refined interior.  I&#146ve been driving my Civic EX for 3 months now and have no complaints.   The ride is smooth, but not too cushy.  The VTEC engine has some kick when you push it, but you don&#146t buy a Civic to speed around town.   The handling is standard; again, don&#146t look to be cruising around corners at 45 mph.   I would agree with several other reviews I&#146ve read commenting on the smoothness of the automatic transmission.   In the city, engine noise is noticeable, but not distracting.  I really like the new interior for 2003.  The gauges get the Volkswagen-treatment with fluorescent blue and red backlighting.  As I&#146ve stated before, the cockpit is surprisingly refined for an entry-level sedan.  The new seat fabric is also very posh &#150 the front seats are very comfortable and as a 6 foot 2 gentlemen I appreciate the height adjustment (I&#146ve got it on the lowest setting for maximum headroom).  Temperature controls are placed perfectly within reach.  The included CD Player sounds great and is easy to control.  I like the 60/40 fold-down back seats for transporting skis and other bulky or long items in the trunk.   

That&#146s about it.   In my opinion you can&#146t beat a Civic.  It&#146s a responsible car &#150 reliable and fuel efficient - with just enough frills (i.e. moon roof, snazzy interior, CD player, and moderately-peppy VTEC engine) to keep any first time car buyer entertained and feeling good about their purchase.
