            We bought our 1st Corsica at a auto auction it was 1989 and we bought it in 1993. We only paid 1,000 for it so we really expected we would have to put money into it. Well, this car ran and it ran and it was perfect! After a couple years as the miles piled up on it we did have to put in a new transmission....but the car had well over 100,000 miles on it. Just the regular routine things were all we ever had to do to this car. So a few years later we went back to the same auction and bought another somewhat newer Corsica, this one was a 1991 and we bought it in 1996. WE paid 1,100 for this one...it was loaded and once again we had to put no money into this car. It ran just like the 1st...perfectly. We eventially traded the older model in on a Taurus and we still have the &quot;91&quot; Corsica. It has almost 200,000 miles on it and runs wonderful! We have had great luck with both our Corsica's and I would recommend any one looking at buying one to go and do it! They really are great running cars and very reasonably priced.<br><br>
