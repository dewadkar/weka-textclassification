            The Volvo V70 Cross Country and the AWD wagon are among the nicest people movers around.  On paper, they seem to offer the owner the world in a well engineered, safe, if somewhat expensive package.  Among car guys, these are highly sought after as family grocery getters with pizazz.

<b>Great features:</b>
The list of features on either the Cross Country or AWD wagon are impressive.  These include power heated seats, CD changer, moonroof, dual zone climate control, richly appointed leather interior, wood accents, trip computer and real-time data, etc.  

<b>The driving experience:</b>
The V70 does not drive like a wagon.  It feels like a tuned sports sedan.  The 190 hp low-pressure turbo is adequate in most driving conditions.  The AWD does make the car feel heavier.  The Cross Country model which sits up about 1.5" higher than the AWD or standard V70 wagon gives the driver a little better view of the road.

<b>Safety:</b>
Volvo has been well known since the 40's as a leader in safety.  This car certainly exemplifies that.  With Child Safety Seat Anchors (3 years before it was mandatory), head curtain and side airbags (still not offered on most cars), and anti-lock brakes, this is a tank with safety and style.

<b>Common problems:</b>
There are some serious issues with the 1998 AWD and Cross Country models, according to a friend of mine who was a Volvo Service Manager.  Among the problems is a viscous coupler malfunction which is demonstrated by a clunking sound and vibration.  Part of the reason this occurs is due to owners not ensuring the same tread depth on all four tires.  Apparently, as the tires wear differently, the viscous coupler (I think this is the part that sends information to all 4 wheels regarding traction levels) senses differences in traction and applies more where it's needed.  The bottom line is that you should rotate your tires on any Volvo AWD car every 5K miles.  You <b>CANNOT</b> buy only 2 new tires and rotate out 2 old ones.  This is the primary reason for problems in the AWD system.  The brakes also need to be replaced more frequently than most cars.

<b>Summary:</b>
Overall, this is an expensive car to buy and maintain.  You'll have a difficult time trying to find a 98 which is still under warranty.  Make sure to check with the dealer about the exact in service date.  You have 3 years or 36K miles from <b>THAT</b> date to take advantage of warranty work.  Also, be sure to give the Volvo dealer the VIN - they can check for recall work which needs to be done and the service history.  Running a CARFAX is also a good idea to ensure that it's not a theft recovery, salvage, or flood title.  Best of luck!
