            This is a great car for kids who are just getting their DL, and have to pay insurance, and have parents who don't want a high car payment.  This car is reliable, affordable, fun, nice, comfortable, and a great run-around car.  This car could easily fit 4 people inside.  But if we all go back to being a teenager, and filling our cars with friends to the max...you could even fit 5.  We just bought a brand new one at Drew Ford in El Cajon, Ca for $7995...A brand new one, with everything except a CD player.  It has been great.  We get about 28 Miles/gal city driving, and 38-miles/gal freeway driving.  Our insurance is really cheap, and our payments our really low.  This has been a great investment for us.  Parents of teenagers...This is a great car idea for your driving or soon to be driving teen.  It's low payments, low insurance, and a great excuse to get your out to work and school on their own.  Give yourself a little more freedom, and give them a little more freedom.  It's great.  <br><br>
