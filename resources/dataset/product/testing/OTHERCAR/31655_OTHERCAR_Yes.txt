            I like every thing about this loyale. I bought it because of the price
(about $12,000). Another reason that at least a dozen people had told me they had got 200,000 miles on their sabaru's and loved them and had bought
more of them. I must concur that this little vehicle has given me my moneys worth and more. My teenage kids have learned to drive on her and i've carried mail through all kinds of weather and all kinds of roads.
    The power windows still work like new 7 yrs later and the air condition has never needed a recharge. its good on the interstate and not bad in severe wind.
    This car has poor take off power on a steep hill but I feel is trade off for gas mileage and cost and longevity.  <br><br>
