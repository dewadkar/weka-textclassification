            When I arrived home from my first year of college, I was sick of getting my film developed. Not only did the developing costs add up, but the inconvenience of taking the film to the store was a hassle. 
Consequently, I decided to purchase a digital camera with the remaining money I had from the year.(which was not very much) 
I had a price range in mind, and it was easy to stick to. Under $300 was what I was looking to spend. After many trips to my local best buy and circuit city, I finally made my decision to go with the Olympus D-460. Not only because I knew that I could rely on the olympus for durability and superb pictures, but the price was just right. 
After opening the camera, I was pleasantly surprised to find how simple the initial setup was. Within minutes, the battery was in the camera and i was shooting away. Connecting the camera to my computer could not have been easier. I put one cable into the serial port and inserted the cd into my computer and the rest was cake. 
I have been using my camera for almost two weeks now, and i have not found one problem with it. The batteries are still going strong and the picture quality is unparalled. 
However, I have not printed a picture on my printer that I have taken with the camera, but I imagine they will be high quality, photo-like images.
Another suggestion, is to take the memory card to a local photo shop to have them print professional pictures. I was suprised as to how cheap the prices were. (under $1 for a 5X7.) 
I highly recommend this camera as an entry level camera for the rookies of digital photography, or even someone with experience who isnt looking to spend a lot of money on a good camera.
