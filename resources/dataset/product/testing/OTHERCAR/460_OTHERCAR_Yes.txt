            I bough this camera right before Xmas simply for the price ($150 after coupons at Staples).  I also bought an additional 256MB SD card as the onboard memory is only 16MB and won't get you far.  

I was very impressed by the quality of the camera especially since I was very much tempted to spend nearly $400 for the Canon S400 instead.  The pictures are sharp, clean, and are very comparable to "Better" and higher priced cameras that I've tried.  A word of caution however...to truly evaluate the camera's pictures, try a couple of different places for printing.  I printed them at three different CVS and Walgreens and the CVS pics were truly amazing whereas the Walgreens prints were so lousy that you would swear it was the camera that stunk!  

As for the camera...very few manual features, although you do have modes for sports, nighttime, etc.  The movie mode was great to have since it comes in handy for situations such as filming my son's latest karate kata at the school so that we can later refer to it at home when practicing.  I did notice that on the movie mode, there is a slight fluttering sound that is captured.  I tried two different CX6330s and they both had that.  Also, slight light fluctuations can also be noted in dim or low lighting situations where the camera finds dark and light objects and seems to be compensating for them.  

As for the battery life...the lithium Kodak batteries that came with it yielded about 200 shots and six 1 minute videos for me.  That's not bad at all!  I am buying 2000Mah rechargeable batteries however and have already bought a four pack of the Kodak lithiums to keep as emergency backups in the camera case.

My only complaint of the camera is the flimsy door that covers the SD card slot and the cable jack for connection to the PC.  The door is flimsy and does not fully swing out of the way, making it a bit touchy to get the card out.  However, a bit of care and I can live with it.  

I really am happy to have spent more than 1/2 of what I was originally going to spend on a digital camera for what I consider to be comparable pictures to what I was hoping from "better" cameras!  Try this camera and you won't be disappointed!
