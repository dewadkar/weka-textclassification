            I bought this car for $2,700 in 1998 with 135,000 miles on it.  

Good:
The LT's 3.1L V6  provides enough power to get you where you're going and has been pretty reliable. At 6'1" I can fit pretty comfortably in this car. It may not seem that relevent but I have come to love the dashboard of this car. Everything is within reach, and the design is suprisingly stylish. I wish I could transfer this dash to my next car.  The car has proven to be pretty safe. It got into a head on collision at 15mph and it still runs so I can't complain. 

Bad:
This car hasn't been without its problems. The fuel gauge hasn't worked consistently since I got the car. Since I've gotten the car I've replaced just about everything involving the coolant system.  It may just be its age but its been a pain.  If the heater core on this car ever went bad again, I would probably roll it off a cliff. Everything else has been simple to work on.
