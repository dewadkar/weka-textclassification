            This is a nice truck!  It's the same truck as the Ford pickup. They're both built by ford.  The differences are in the body styling and interior features.
I have the extended cab version. Rear doors on both sides is an extremely handy feature. There are two fold-down seats in the rear, but only one adult can ride comfortably while seated there.
The TL package includes custom graphics by Troy Lee Designs, noted for there work in motocross and BMX.  The package looks great.  I'm always getting compliments on the look of the truck.
It's a tough dependable truck. It's carried me through 2 major snow storms in Buffalo, NY. While in four wheel drive mode I easily negotiated streets that were buried in 2 or more feet of snow.
Only 2 service related problems, both covered by warranty. The thermostat was replaced and the rear brakes needed new return springs.
