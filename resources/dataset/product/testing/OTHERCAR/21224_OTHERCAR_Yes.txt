            I've owned an '85 Toyota Corolla SR-5, a '95 Geo Prizm (Corolla look-alike), and now a 4-cylinder '00 Camry LE.  Most people can be divided into two categories: Honda fans and Toyota fans.  At the time I bought this car, I was firmly in the second camp.

When it was time to buy a new car this year, I studied the alternatives and test drove many of them.  I chose the Camry over others because I believe in Toyota's reputation for quality and safety.  I've been very pleased with the reliability of the vehicles I've owned, and Toyotas always score well in the government crash tests.  These were my primary reasons in choosing Camry over Accord.

I test drove the Camry twice, rode in Camry's with friends, and even had a Camry rental car for a few days.  As soon as I bought it and took it home, however, I felt the car was a little sluggish.  I think it has to do with the hilly area in which I live.  I strongly recommend anyone buying a Camry spring for the expensive V6 engine, which has a great reputation.  I thought I could get by with the 4-cyl, and while I can, it definitely lacks power.

Having owned the car a few months, now, I've found a number of other areas for improvement:

<b>Daytime Running Lamps</b> - The Camry comes with a daytime running lamp feature with a light sensor that automatically switches over to headlights when it senses that it's getting darker.  I wish I had a way to control this manually.  If a dark cloud passes overhead, or I drive down a street with overhanging trees, the headlights come on.  This is something I'd like to have some control over, but with the Camry, I don't.

<b>Map/Reading Lights</b> - The Camry LE doesn't have this convenient feature, which many of its competitors do.

<b>Overhead lamp control</b> - is on the ceiling, not conveniently on the dashboard.

<b>Trunk pass-through</b> - is too small!  Why have a trunk pass-through (an essential feature), but cut a small hole for it?  With my Geo (Corolla look-alike), I could fit my bicycle in the trunk/back seat by folding down the rear seats.  Surprisingly, though the Camry is a larger car, the pass-through hole is much smaller.  I had to buy a bike rack.


On the plus side, a CD/cassette/stereo is standard on the LE, and is a very nice system.  Cup holders are nice and sturdy, the ride is quiet, and the headlights are bright.  And, although I can't turn them off, I like the daytime running lamp feature.  I find that fewer people cut in front of me because the lamps make the car seem as if it's moving faster.

Toyota is losing its edge.  Perhaps since their introduction of the Avalon, the Camry has become today's Corolla.  I just feel that they've taken their eye off the ball.  The car may still turn out to be reliable, but I'm disappointed that they haven't taken care of the little things that would make the car truly outstanding.
