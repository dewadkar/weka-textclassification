            I bought my 97 Avenger ES new in early 1998.  At first, I loved it - I was only disappointed with the gas mileage, which was about 16 city 18 highway.  Even on long interstate trips it never got much over 20 mpg.

Over the last year, with about 40,000 miles, the car has started to completely fall apart.  In the last 10 months I've had the fuel pump, oxygen sensor, wheel bearing, transmission speed control sensor, and alternator replaced.  The trim above the window on both sides where the plastic meets the metal roof has curved out and separated and faded to gray.  And it's really starting to rattle.

It still handles great, though, and the braking is really impressive.

I'll never buy another Dodge and shouldn't have bought this one.  The dealership is a pain to deal with and they won't stand behind anything once the warranty is out.  The service manager said &quot;we see a lot of these&quot; when I brought the thing in to have a wheel bearing replaced - not what you want to hear on about a 2 year old, low mileage car.

One last thing - replacing the oxygen sensor did help the gas mileage a bit.  Anyone driving one of these with the 2.5L V6 who is getting terrible gas mileage should have this checked out.<br><br>
