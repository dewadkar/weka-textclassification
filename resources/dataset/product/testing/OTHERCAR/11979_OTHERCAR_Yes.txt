            After my experiences with my wife's POS Hyundai Elantra (see other review), this truck is a dream to own and drive.

I bought it with just over 65000 on the odometer last year and to this day, nothing has broken.  Nothing.  What a refreshing change from the Chariot of Satan (see other review).  

The rear fold down seats are pretty much akin to booster seats for little kids, so if you have much of a caboose, you won't fit on them.  They also sit almost on the floor of the cab, so the person sitting on them has to extend their legs out straight.  This doesn't hurt my feelings though, since this truck isn't made for hauling people and I don't like my wife driving it anyway.  She chose the Chariot (see other review), so she can live with it.

The transmission shifts cleanly, the 4.3L Vortec Engine gets right up and goes, and the 4 wheel drive system clicks in and out with a push of a button.  Nice.  It tends to drink the fuel though.  The seats are comfortable, the heating/cooling system is efficient and does what it is supposed to, the body is solid and the Emerald Green Metallic Clearcoat Paint is beautiful!  The stock soundsystem is pretty good for the year and type (AM/FM, Single CD), and the upholstry and carpet have held up well.  My only complaint about the interior is that the door panels are a bit flimsy and have some "give" to them when you roll the windows up and down.  Not a real biggie.

The turning radius is a bit much, so plan on leaving yourself plenty of room to swing into parking spaces.

All in all, this is the best vehicle I've ever owned.  Now watch, I'll go home and darn thing won't start.  Such is my luck.
