            I have owned my 91 Mercury Capri for about 3 1/2 years and what I've seen has been quite amazing!
Before I took her in.  She had been sitting outside under the S. Florida sun and salted rain for 2 years, never moved, turned on, covered, washed, nothing just sat there.  Personally I thought the car would never run in the condition it was put through, but when I cranked her up, damn she sounded good!  To my amazement the climate and never moving didn't affect the car at all!
Now, the only things I have done to my Capri was replace the air filter, all the belts, and all other preventative maintenance.  I also replaced the radiator with a metal one (there was nothing wrong with it I just personally don't believe in a plastic one!) and of course her normal tune up and oil change.  I have always believed in servicing my Capri in a timely manner.
I still have not had a problem with the light motors, window motors, engine, transmission, rag top, steering, nothing.  My reliable Capri stills runs smooth and yet aggressive.
