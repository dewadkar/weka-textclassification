            I was one of those people that really hesitated to buy a mini-van.  I didn't want to feel old and &quot;mom like&quot;.  I was SO wrong.  I cannot believe how much more comfortable it is to drive than a standard car.  Not to mention the room that the whole family has.  We used the van on a cross country camping trip with a two year old (I was also 5 months pregnant) and we were very happy with the space, milage and performance.  

The only negative is that sometimes the engine &quot;thunks&quot; when you don't come to a complete stop and then you hit the gas.  I have also heard they are discontinuing this model.  

Pregnant women:  it is so much easier to get in and out of this van.  Only negative for pregnant women: the radio is a little hard to reach once you have a belly.<br><br>
