            Got my 1998 "Superblack" Nissan Maxima SE from a private dealer for $18,900CDN (Roughly $13,800USD). I thought the price was a little steep but more and more the car keeps growing on me.

Basically, the 4th generation Maximas, specifically the 1997-98 models, are the best ones to look for. The 97-98's have revised cosmetics on the exterior body as well as some "extras" including digital odometer and 16" wheels (SE only). I've found that the 4th gens are probably the best ever looking Maximas out there, including the 2000-2003's and the new 2004's. I also think it has a step up from the Camry's and Accords.

The Maxima is fast, in part due to the weight; the Maxima weighs in at around 3,000lbs. Mostly though, it is because of the VQ engine in the Max which has made any owner familiar with that engine grinning. Now, although 190HP at the crank is nice, ANOTHER 20-45HP can be freed up just by swapping in a much less restrictive y-pipe, b-pipe, intake, and muffler, BUT, if money is tight, the y-pipe offers the most gain, easily 15HP freed. Now, continuing on with modifications, there are plenty for the Max, so it can look as distinguished as you want.

Basically what sold me on the 4th gen Maximas are the excellent price/benefit ratio. It really did seem like I got a lot of features for the money. Just SOME of the features my Maxima came with:

- Automatic climate control
- 16" 5 spoke alloy wheels (SE only)
- Heated and 8 way/4 way powered front leather seats
- Keyless entry w/ theft deterrent system
- All power options
- White faced guages
- Front and side airbags
- Moonroof
- AM/FM/Cass/CD (4 speakers w/ components)
- Smooth 3.0L VQ30DE V6 engine
- ABS
- 4 wheel disc brakes
- Homelink transmitter

and MUCH more..

The car does have it's flaws. The "sport" suspension (Available on the SE only) is very squishy. It rides rough and I doubt it would have any additional handling benefits. The factory Goodyear's, I highly recommend you to replace them. Already subpar on dry pavement, traction can be limited noticeably in wet pavement especially for a FWD car.

I've also found that the factory BOSE system to be subpar. Noticeable clipping from the speakers if you bring the volume up to a certain loudness (about 50%). Otherwise, the audio is decent.

The 4th gens are known to have noises coming from the cabin. Usually it's something loose in the dash, door panels or vents. I found that quite strange since I find the fit and finish to be excellent.

The factory paint has also been well documented. The paint simply doesn't stand up to everyday use. Mine came with a lot of chips on the front bumper and hood, and many other Maxima owners have had the same thing, regardless of driving style or whatever instances. If you plan on keeping your Max until it fails on you, I'd suggest you give it a respray, that's what I plan to do.

I also seem to be getting, what I think is awful mileage, even for an auto. I'm not sure if MPG in the low 20's is good for all city driving? Especially since I'm using 94 octane. My engine also seems to make metal-to-metal noises when I start up sometimes. Hopefully, they are nothing more than simple issues that can be fixed.

It seems like I have a lot of complaints for the Max, but otherwise the Maxima will probably run forever once I address the issues I have with it (Self perfectionist). It has relatively good performance, rather good looking aesthetics, lots of features, and a good range of aftermarket support (For those who are looking for it). Frankly speaking, when modified a bit in the styling and performance areas, the Maxima definitely ranks as one of the best all round performance sedans; not exactly M5 material, but admirable.

The PROS include:
- "VQ" equipped engine (3.0L V6) (Power & reliability)
- Quiet and roomy cabin
- Good looks
- Surprising performance
- Lightweight
- Excellent fit and finish
- Front and side airbags
- Fun to drive

The CONS include:
- Subpar fuel economy
- Lousy factory paint
- "Squishy" sport suspension
- Lousy factory BOSE sound system
