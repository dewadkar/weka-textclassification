            When my mom sold her 1990 Passat to me in '97, she bought a brand new, silver Passat GLX.  She was so happy with the (admittedly poor, but comfortable) 1st generation that she moved on to an upscale model, and in my and her opinion, it was a great choice.  I've had many oppurtunities to drive this car (mainly while the '90 was in the shop), and it is more than worth the market value of around $15,000.

The Passat GLX is the top of line model, with a 2.8 liter VR6 engine pushing out around 170 horsepower.  While this may seem a little low for a V6, the engine produces lots of low-end torque, making it great for daily driving (as opposed to some 200+hp V6's which don't get significant torque until near the redline), and the engine is whisper quiet.  This car comes with alloy wheels, power everything, and a power sunroof is optional, as well as leather interior and 6-disc CD changer.  We opted for the plush interior, as my mom has acute allergies, and it is comfortable and holds up very well.  As her allergies are a big issue for her, another reason she chose this car was the pollen filter and recirculating air vents/air conditioning.

On the road, this car handles itself perfectly in city, country, or highway driving.  A 4-speed automatic with full-range floor shifter and kickdown is optional on this car, and, as opposed to the 1990 version, this transmission is a joy.  Is it smooth, and the ranges are perfectly chosen for any type of driving.  With this transmission, the car averages about 23mpg in city driving, and 28 on the highway, which is excellent for an automatic 6-cylinder.  On winding country roads, the car doesn't show how heavy it really is, and digs into hilly curves with zest.  The torquey engine will push you against your seatback while you pull out of turns, making you think you're in a sports car rather than a midsize sedan.

Being a sedan, this car has plenty of room for anything.  With roomy rear seats and a spacious trunk, you can haul lots of groceries, clothes, sports eqipment (we once hauled sparring gear for 10 Tae Kwon Do Students, with gear for each being in a large dufflebag), or whatever else you need to carry.  The rear seats are also comfortable for even long rides, and we've often taken our full 5-person family on 3 or 4 hour trips with no complaints.  The front seats are even more roomy and comfortable, and the dash controls well-laid out and large enough so they don't interfere with driving.  The only interior complain are the cupholders... they were well-thought out, but poorly designed.  They flip down near the passenger's legs, and are actually very nice for holding one or two large drinks in safety.  However, the fact that they are on a hinge, and thier placement, makes it easy to drop something on them or accidentally kick and break them.  In this car, they have broken thee times, but our dealer fixed them for free each time.

The exterior styling is pleasant as well.  No aggresive lines or corners, but not too rounded, the exterior exudes an air of upscale comfort and performance.  It's not too agressive looking, but not staid either.

There have been no major mechanical problems in the time we've owned this car; no minor ones either.  The only problems have been a broken rear trunk lock and drivers side door handle, which, along with the cupholders, have all been fixed for free by the dealer.  The warranty and service for this car are excellent, and have given us yet another reason to buy another Volkswagen for our next car.

If you want to own a luxury vehicle just to have the Lexus, Mercedes, or Acura badge, don't go for this car.  However, if you want to own a luxury vehicle to enjoy all the benefits of a roomy and comfortable ride, quiet yet powerful engine, large cargo room, and convenient standard and optional equipment, all at a price that is decidedly unluxurylike, this is the car for you.<br><br>
