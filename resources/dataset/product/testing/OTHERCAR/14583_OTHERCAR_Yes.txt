                About 3 months ago, i decided to sell everything I own and move to Los Angeles....from Ohio nonetheless.   I was driving a new dodge avenger and chose to sell it to pay off my debt and buy a used car.  I came across a 1991 Honda Accord LX, with 190,000 miles on it.  I test drove it and it seemed to drive perfectly.  The body was beautiful and the tan interior was mint.  For $2,000 I drove it home.
    Now I'm in L.A.  Its been 3 months,  a 3,000mile drive from ohio and another 10,000 odd miles later and the car is still Perfect!!!  I did have the timing belt replaced before i left for california though.  They say you should have it changed every 100,000 miles at least.  If it should wear out and break while you're driving, it can cause major engine damage.   VERY IMPORTANT....when you have the timing belt changed, shop around!  some places charge up to $700.  I found a place to do it for $200 which wasn't bad at all.
    The car now has about 206,000 miles and still purrs like a kitten.  I'm ready and able to purchase a new car now, but I'm not sure if i want to.  I love this little accord and i'm quite curious to see how long it will last.  300k....500k miles?  The suspense kills me!   And such a little car with such high miles and drives so smooth!  How do they do it?   
     Lastly.....If you do need a used car,  check out a 91 honda accord lx... Mine is auto with power everything.  Its an insanely great car for a very low price.  Just do your homework and shop around, its not hard to find an older accord that runs this well with this many miles.  The Japanese sure can build a great car.
