            I have been driving our GM Safari for about two years now. I was originally very impressed with the many features available in the Safari and the eight person seating capacity. The body itself is boxy but more stylish than many other minivans I've seen. We added some extra features to our package, but the basics are the same in all the Safaris. Here is the general overview of the GM Safari van, in practical terms.

<b>Seats 8</b>
Yes the Safari can indeed seat eight people. It seems to be one of the few minivans available with a seating of eight and we thought it would be ideal for our crew of six (including one car seat). What I must add here is that you would be sadly mistaken to believe that eight adults can fit comfortably in the Safari. We've tried it. The problem is not with the seats themselves, but with the lack of space for a normal adult, or older kid, to squeeze through in order to get into the furthest back seat. It requires one to not only bend down but to fit through a mere foot of space. Otherwise, count on putting the kids in that back seat.

<b>Added features</b>
There are several nice features inherent in the Safari van that I have found useful. For grocery shopping, the back door opens three ways. The top window lifts up and the side doors below it open wide. There is a netted bag that will contain your grocery bags for the ride home that attatches to the sides. The top window/door needs to be handled with caution, however. Once it is given the push to shut, it goes somewhat slowly, but trust me here, it is enhanced by a pull that once knocked a friend in the head as she was reaching for a last minute item. It also needs to be watched around children when opening, as it lifts rather effortlessly.

Another feature I find useful is the amount of cupholders and caddys placed in all areas of the van. There are pockets on the back of the seats which are also handy. There is an open space between the two front seats for items and the glove compartment is based on the console, under the cupholder/ashtray (aka change holder). There is a sunglasses holder above, as well as an apparent CD holder. Considering our Safari came with a tape player, this is rather odd. There are several different lights placed in all areas of the van, which are also helpful.


<b>On the Road</b>
This is my sorest point with the Safari. What looks like a solid, weighty, safe vehicle for a mother hauling her children around town, is in fact one of the poorest handling vehicles I have driven in challenging weather conditions. During my first winter driving the Safari, I believed it was simply the fact that I needed to get used to driving a large van, rather than the old Buick. This year, I am wiser, after asking my husband to take it for a ride one snowy day. For starters, it had really loose steering. I do not always feel in control of driving it, especially on a windy day. Secondly, now that I mentioned wind, I have to add that the Safari is at the mercy of a windy day. I can literally feel the strong pull of wind driving it-and it's not my alignment. 

I have come to realize that winter weather and the Safari van are at odds with each other. My husband agreed with me on this one after his ride. Not only do I not feel safe driving it in snow, but we both felt that the van was at risk for sliding at stops. In fact, I have to literally crawl in order to not slide, and I am a very cautious driver with years of winter driving experience. Bottom line here is that my little Toyota guided me through entire smowstorms, but the Safari makes me shake at the hint of driving far on a snowy day.

If you do not have snow to worry about, then the Safari might be fine. In the summer we have driven it on road trips and it has performed fine. I was not shocked by the gas consumption, and I felt it got rather good mileage for the size. For statistic sake, it had a V6 engine, which does better on gas than a larger engine but the Safari has ample power for it's engine. It can also be handy for moving large items, since the seats can fold down. I fit a six foot bookshelf in there last year.

<b>Conclusions</b>
I am right on the fence concerning the Safari. I'll admit that we will not survive another winter with this van and plan to look for a new vehicle soon. It suited many of our needs such as space, convenience, and power, but we live in a snow belt. I do not feel in control of the Safari for winter driving and safety is my main priority with a van full of children. If you are looking for a carpool van and live in an area without wind or snow, the Safari might be a decent choice. I would not advise the Safari for my Northern neighbors, though.
