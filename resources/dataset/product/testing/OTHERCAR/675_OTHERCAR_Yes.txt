                I Always wanted to take photos like a professional and the Nikon coolpix 950 gave me the options needed to accomplish this. Though a little pricey, $999.00 retail. I found mine on the net for $750.00. At this price I was one step closer to taking great photos and printing them at home.
    I found the camera all it was supposed to be. The camera has two modes, either fully automatic or programmable. I took the camera right out of the box, set the automatic mode, and started cranking photos. I set the output resolution to extra fine, giving me about 19 photos on the included 8-mg card. To complement the camera it pays to have a great printer. I use the HP Photosmart p1100. 
    I used the included software to render great photos but the included software could have been better. I used my own software, Adobe 5.0, which produced better quality photos then I had already developed using their software. 
    The programming mode I found to be a little difficult to operate and the booklet that comes with the camera doesn't explain anything in detail. To get a detailed explanation you had to access the software disc. This made it very cumbersome. Especially if you are out. They could resolve this problem if they just included a little carry along booklet.  
    You can buy additional lenses for telephoto or wide angle shots at a reasonable price along with an external flash. 
    Included were the camera, batteries lens cover, wrist strap, camera case and the software.<br><br>
