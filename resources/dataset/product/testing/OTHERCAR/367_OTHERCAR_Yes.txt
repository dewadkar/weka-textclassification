            Surrrrrge!!!! Yells the half baked, twenty something adventurer, showing a four day shadow.  This is the all around SUV of the millenium.  Supprisingly enough they haven't been bought up as fast like the Explorer's or the 4runners when they first came out.  This thing has the rough and tumble ability needed for extreamists, with the sophisticated comforts mom wouldn't be without.  The two things that are really new about this baby are the inside bike rack, and the med kit for those adreniline rush junkies who just tore off an arm while doing this tight freestyle no hands, feet upsidedown....well you get the picture.  The colors are pretty standard for any Nissan product, but the look is considerably different than the pathfinder.  I fell in love with this one the moment I saw it.  It has all the comforts of a luxury towncar.  If you have the funds, go right now, yes do lock your front door because you might not be back in a while after buying because of all the roads you are now going to be tearing up.

I don't think there is a better two door SUV on the market today.<br><br>
