            Sorry the body of this review doesnt look very good.  I tried fixing it, but each time it would take me back to the previous screen and my review would be deleted.  I had to copy and paste it so it wouldnt be completley erased, and this is what happened:

I bought a '99 Cavalier Z-24 about 6 months ago. I highly recommend this car for driving in nice weather, but living up 
north, I find that it is not the best winter car. It takes a long time 
to get the heat started in the car, and sometimes a while to 
defrost. The brakes don't work well over ice and snow, making a 
"bang-bang" sound and not stopping in time, sometimes 
swerving a bit. I almost hit 10 people who were getting off a bus 
one day because in all their stupidity, they walked out in front of 
me, and my car would not stop. They ended up being scattered 
on both sides of my car giving me dirty looks. The car has a very wimpy horn, and I am embarrassed to use it. 

As for summer driving, it rides very smooth. It has a great gas 
mileage, and looks like a good sports car too. It has a 
lot of features, such as power doors and windows, fog lights, cruise control, and a power sunroof. It is a great car for a student, or 
even a first car. This car steers really well, and as long as there 
is no ice or snow on the road, the brakes work really well. A 
feature that I do like about this car is that the back seat opens to the trunk,leaving more space for hauling long and large objects. 
For hot days, the air conditioning is powerful and cools the car in no time at all. 

The body on the car seems to be weak. The black plastic (I don't know what to call it) on the front of the car underneath has 
broken and is about to snap off any day now. This has happened just by bottoming out on driveways or curbs, or by running over 
heavy snow. Also, my car was recently hit by someone backing 
out of their driveway, and there is quite the dent in the rear 
quarter panel just from a little tap from the speed and force of 
another car backing into mine. 

In the six months that I have had this car, I have had no major 
mechanical problems with it (besides the brakes which can only 
be fixed by being replaced with better ones). It is also a good car to travel in (for two or three people). I would mainly recommend this car for a student, or a family with no children, since it is not very spacious in the back seat. 

The problem that I do have with this car it that the check engine 
light will always come on for no reason when my engine doesn't 
need to be checked. With regular adjustments, this light can be 
prevented from coming on, however it is not something that the 
average person can fix. 
I know two other people with Cavaliers, and '95 and a '90 and 
they both have the same problems with their cars.
