            I owed a '92 Trooper that I bought new for about 6 years.  I bought it because in spite of Consumer Reports' article stating that it was prone to tipping, I thought it was very reliable and I got an excellent deal, as I was buying at year end.  

The pros to the vehicle were its roominess and reliability.  The cons to the vehicle were that it is a bit sluggish in handling and extremely expensive to repair.  I had very little work done on the vehicle, as the components were reliable and I took care of it with regular maintenance.  However, when I finally needed a muffler, the local dealer even suggested I look elsewhere.  I was resorting to the dealer to get an Isuzu part, but the price on the muffler was almost $800 and that was before installation costs.  I ended up going to a custom muffler shop that did it for $90.  I endured two accidents in the vehicle, both covered by insurance, but the numbers were high on those, too as I had to get estimates.

If you can get a deal, like end of year, or something like that, then the vehicle is a steal and should give you 5-6yrs without repairs (provided you do your due diligence), however check repair costs by calling for parts before they start happening, so you know whether to endure them or not in the long run.<br><br>
