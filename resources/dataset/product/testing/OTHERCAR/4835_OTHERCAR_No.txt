            I purchased a Chrysler LHS, 2000 for the following reasons:

- Styling
- Price
- Features 
- 253 HP engine
- 0% financing
- Ride
- I wanted something luxury without the luxury price tag.

The LHS at first glance filled all of those needs and more.  Georgeous leather seating, beautiful lines, a powerful engine and loaded with extras.  Cruise control, antiloc brakes, traction control, AM/FM casette with an in dash 4 CD player, heated seats w/power, built in compass, outside thermometer, automatic climate control, trip computer, gas mileage calculator, and the list goes on!

I was stuck between this car and the 300M, but wasn't sure which way to go so I gave them both a drive.  The 300M had a very sporty ride but the LHS had that perfect blend of comfort and control with good steering wheel feedback.  Then I heard about the 0% financing and it closed the deal for me!  I bought the LHS.

So here are my experiences too date:

- Week one in a rain storm the wiper control burned out and I had no wipers.
- I had a vibration in the front end and in the first 30 days my rotors were replaced due to uneven wear.
- The vibration continued and they found a bent rim.  They tried to charge me for it.
- My weather strippings were all cut too short and had to be replaced.  (The replacements were cut too short as well and had to be reordered)
- My alarm did not work and after 3 weeks of inspections they found it had to be reprogrammed.
- Both headlamp assemblies had to be replaced.

While he 253 horses, the powerful stereo system, the cavernous trunk, the livingroom like interior and design are all terrific, this car is filled with problems.  After my first 6 months of ownership i am almost waiting for what will go wrong next.  When I was looking for a new car, my friends and family urged me to buy anything but Chrysler.  The company has been plagued with quality issues and based on my experience, they have not benefited at all from the Daimler deal.  I can't imagine a mercedes with this many problems.  Also, one can be had for slightly more than the Chrysler.  

If I didn't have all the problems I admit I would love the car because it has so many features I love, but with all the quality issues it's hard to justify recommending it. Also, with the poor customer service at Chrysler, it makes it even harder to justify.  They sure want to sell these but  repairing them is another issue! 

Buy something else!!!  You'll save time, aggravation and probably get a better quality vehicle.
