            I had to rent a car while mine was being worked on. The best value was a Daewoo Lanos. I picked up the blue 2000 4 door on a Monday. It had 11 miles on it. When I returned it 11 days later it had 2063 miles on it. It was equipped with the DOHC 93 hp motor/4 speed auto, AC, AM/FM/Cass.

The car was peppy, responsive, and ran comfortably at sustained highway speeds of 80 mph (to and from Ma to NJ). AC didn't bog the motor as much I thought it would, averaged 30 mpg. Only thing I wished it had was cruise control. Could live with the auto over the manual inthis car.

While I had the rental, I stopped at a local Daewoo dealer in Ma. I looked over the cars they had. Carpeting was a little thin, looked like it would wear quickly (recommend floor mats), interior looked/felt plasticky, but expected. Controls seemed solid/worked well. Big trunk. Would like to see a compartment for the center console. Cruise control isn't even an option. I did like the 2 knobs on the seat for height/tilt.

I owned an 88 and a 90 LeMans VL -4speed manual, no options (built by Daewoo for Pontiac). The 88 I had for 13 months, put 45k miles on it, and averaged 49.5 mpg before it got totalled by a drunk driver. I owned the 90 LeMans for 5 years, put 128k miles on it, and averaged 33 mpg. The only work I did to the car was change the timing belt at 125k miles and weld the lower driver's door hinge back onto the door (5 years and 125k miles - door hinges were spot welded onto door &amp; frame). Never had to bring either car in for warranty work.

The new Daewoo's quality seems to have improved alot in the last 10 years. If you have the extra money, I would opt for the Nubria (especially if you need/want cruise). If not, I would opt for the DOHC over the SOHC motor.<br><br>
