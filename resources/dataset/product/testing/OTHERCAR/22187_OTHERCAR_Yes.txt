            Woo hoo!  My last epinion managed to collect four hits (as of this moment).  Seeing as how I have made a triumphant return to this site, I have decided to stay a while longer and write some more (a.k.a. cha-ching!).  If you were fortunate enough to avoid my last epinion you should continue to do so unless you are bored and have spare time, which, since you are reading this sentence, I assume you do.  In that case it was on the film <i>Evolution</i>. 

Since this site ends with ".com", I figure they're going down pretty soon, so stay tuned for some new epinions in my last ditch effort to make some dinero (that's money to you non-immigrants).  And to those loyal epinioners on my WOT or who have me on their WOT, I just want to thank them for making my return the juggernaut it has become.  In return I promise to read all your epinions that I have missed over the last 5 months.  Yes [pause], I am lying.

<b>Kodak DC3400 Digital Camera</b>.  Here it goes:

This epinion is for all of those people like myself who know nothing about digital cameras but want one anyway.  First off, ask yourself, Why do I want a digital camera?  If your answer is "'Cause they look cool," you are either rich, stupid, or a combination of both.  As of this moment I don't think any digital camera can take pics better than your standard 35mm camera.  Nerds will argue, but I'm sure you common folk will agree.  If you want something that looks cool buy a taser or something.  Now <i>those</i> look cool.  However, if your answer is along the lines of "I'd rather print pics," "I hate buying film," "I send a lot of pics using the web," or "I'm afraid the photo developers in the lab will turn me in," then keep reading.

I have never used another digital camera before so I honestly have no basis for comparison.  This is why I'm just gonna tell you why the DC3400 is a decent buy.  First off, here are some specs:

Picture Resolution: 2.0 Megapixels
Memory Storage: 8 MB compactflash card
LCD Screen Size: 1.8"
Zoom: 3x Digital, 2x Optical

The best thing about this camera is it's ease of use.  There's a rotating button with the options Capture, Review, Connect, and Camera Setup.  Above the LCD screen is a Menu button, and to the right are up and down arrows and beneath left and right arrows.  The screen is very clear in full color, and with the ease of the arrows, reviewing pics or going through the menu is a breeze.

If you have been doing research, this camera has the same features of other comparable cameras.    There's built-in flash, automatic timer, date and time stamp, adjusting exposure, red-eye button, take pics in black and white or sepia, infinity focus/close-up button, adding borders, etc, etc, etc.  You can also change the picture quality from good, better, to best.  "Good" will suffice for pics on the web, but if you plan to print, use "Best."  The resolution can also vary from 896x592 or 1760x1168.  Adjusting these options will change the number of pics you can save onto your memory card.  At low resolution and good quality you can get about 95 pics saved.  At "high" and "best" you get about 15 saved.  You can always buy a larger memory card, though.

As for the pics, you won't hear any complaints from me.  The pictures come out very clear and sharp.  If you have never seen a pic from a digital camera, at first it might look odd and kinda "fake," but they print out nicely and they look fine on the web.  I have never printed at "good" quality, but even these pics look very nice online.  As for "best" pics, they print out excellent at sizes of 8x10 or smaller.  Obviously a 1.3 MP camera will taker inferior shots, but 2.0 Megapixels does a wonderful job in case you are debating on whether to get a more powerful camera.

After you have taken pics, you can download them to your computer with the included USB cable or serial cables.  The pics are already in JPEG format, and you can view them with the included ArcSoft PhotoImprssion 2000 software which, in a word, sucks.  However, if you have Internet access, which I assume you do, you can download any better program for free nowadays.  Another nice feature is that you can view the pics as a slide show on your TV.  All required cables should be included, and the software, for me, was very simple to install and use.

As for the downsides, I'm sure a lot of you have heard about this camera's poor battery life.  It's all true.  I highly recommend getting rechargeable batteries.  Plus, I'm a southpaw (that's left-handed, to you youngsters) so when I look through the view finder I have no problems.  I hear that if you are right handed your nose smears the LCD screen.  This can be a pain because the screen gets dirty very fast and I always find myself cleaning it (which takes like 3 seconds).  Plus, the image I see from the view finder is always off from the pic I take.  The sight isn't perfectly aligned.  This could just be my camera, I'm not sure.  Using the LCD screen when taking the pic gives you a more accurate boundary as to what will be in the image, but using the LCD screen kills the batteries.  I also think this camera is a bit heavy.  It weighs about the size of a 16 oz. jar of salsa (I'm eating chips and salsa as I type this).

The camera retails for about $400 and comes with a 1 year warranty, but I got my camera for $220.  This leads me to my next section, purchase price.  eBay sells them for about $350 and pricewatch.com has them for about $315, but I got mine from some dude selling it from his car.  If you're gonna buy it this way, there are a few things you should know.  First off, you have to ignore the fact that the camera probably had a previous owner, and that owner probably does not know you are about to buy his/her camera.  Second, make sure you look in the box and make sure a camera is in there.  Third, make sure it works.  If the seller doesn't let you try it out, leave!  Fourth, make sure the number of people you are with outnumbers the number of sellers.  OK, class.  If the seller is just one individual, make sure you are at least with ONE buddy.  If there are 3 people in the seller's party, what is the minimum number of friends you should have at your side?  Yes, 3!  Including you makes 4, and you outnumber them.  Good.

OK.  Overall, this would make a decent first time camera for personal or web use.  The pictures are the standard fare for a 2.0 MP camera, but they look very good.  If you want to get a 3.0+ MP camera, it's your call, but these images suit me fine.  The best thing about this camera is how user friendly it is.  You can pretty much figure out all the options without even reading the manual, and the menu is easy to go through.  And just to mention, going digital means never having to worry about film or taking a bad pic.  You can delete anything you don't like or use imaging software to alter your pics.  I think it's a good investment.
