            My first car was a 1987 Jeep Cherokee, and since then, I've owned nothing but Jeeps.  Currently, I own a 93 Grand Cherokee Limited and a 93 Grand Cherokee Laredo.  Let me say, for the first year that Jeep produced this vehicle, they sure made a winner!  As a 20 year old College student, let me tell you how great I feel when I step out of this elegant looking vehicle to go to my classes, when everyone else is driving Ford Escorts and Honda Civics.  Jeeps just scream class, and there is a certain attitude that comes with Jeep ownership that you acquire.  I love the power, both of my Jeeps have 5.2 L V8 engines that give me the power I need when I need to overtake, but they're quiet enough that I can barely hear them when I'm coasting along at 55.  The interior is fantastic; from my Laredo's fantastic CD system to my Limited's automatic climate control, they can't be beat.  Power seats with such precise control it's impossible not to get comfortable.  Visibility is fantastic, and a 4'11&quot; female, I like to be able to be up high for once in my life!  The control and handling is unparalleled, and don't even get me started about control in the snow!  I can't tell you how many times I've driven by someone who was stuck and spinning their tires, while I just cruised on by.  Let me note, though, that it does take some skill to learn the nuances of 4x4 systems; I learned to drive in one, so don't think that first time 4x4 drivers will be able to conquer any weather condition.  They are fantastic, but they won't do the driving for you.  It takes skill, caution, and practice.  Sermon aside, I will never own anything but a Jeep.  I drive the Limited when I feel like some luxury.  I drive my Laredo when I want a little more attitude.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants to be part of an elite group.  As the saying goes towards non-Jeep drivers: &quot;It's a Jeep thing.  You wouldn't understand.&quot;<br><br>
