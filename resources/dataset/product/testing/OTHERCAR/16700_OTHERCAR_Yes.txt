            I admit at the get-go I got a great buy on this camera. A friend told me Circuit City was discontinuing the Mavica FD-85 and they had one left - no box, no accessories, for $299. Fortunately this friend didn't tell me "no accessories," so when we got to Circuit City we made the poor sales person search high and low for the accessories, and after he had enlisted the help of every free sales agent on the floor, they found the accessories that we didn't know were not supposed to be a part of the $299 deal. `Like I said, we lucked out.

So, here we are with a digital camera that lists for $899 and which frequently sells for as much as $699 in every brick n mortar camera store around town. And this camera has it all as far as I'm concerned. It comes with a battery that allows over 100 minutes of camera use, an AC adaptor that doubles as a battery charger, built in intelligent flash with an anti redeye feature, multiple fixed focus settings ranging from a half meter to seven meters, a macro focus setting that permits great close-ups, and a half dozen program settings that permit great pics in a variety of lighting situations. Plus the camera can take high quality pictures all the way up 1280x960 resolution. And by playing with the light settings and focus settings we can make a lot of "trick" photography pictures and do so without wasting any film at all, just bring lots of floppy disks.

The only negatives I can think of is that the memory stick and floppy disk adaptor fot the memory stick both cost extra. Also, after searching high and low on the Net I have been unable to find another Mavica FD85 for such a good price. Friends, relatives, and people at work all want me to come up with another Sony Mavica FD-85 for $299 and I have not been able to find another one for this price. Please let me know if you can and I will take three of them off your hands if you are willing to sell them for the same price you paid.
