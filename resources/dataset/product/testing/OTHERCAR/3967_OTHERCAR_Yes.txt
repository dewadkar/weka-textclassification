            My old Mercedes was in the shop more than it was on the road.  I needed a new vehicle and was afraid to buy another used car.  I couldn't afford a luxury car, but wanted something safe and reliable.  The answer for me was a Saturn.

This was the first new car I ever bought without assistance from a parent or spouse.  The price was around $12,000 and the dealership treated me with respect and courtesy, explaining (and showing) how the car is built in a way I could easily understand.

I was impressed by the solid frame, the front and rear being designed to collapse in a major collision in order to protect the driver and passengers.  I ordered the black bumpers instead of the painted ones, so it might stay looking &quot;new&quot; a little longer.  I loved the way the doors &quot;bounce back&quot; when pushed, instead of denting.

When my Saturn was only three weeks old, my son put the car to the test.  He backed out of the driveway without noticing the oncoming vehicle, and broadsided a police van!  I hadn't even received my license plates yet, and I was sick as I imagined what my new car looked like.  The whole side of the police van was mashed in.  We walked back to take a look, and I couldn't believe my eyes - there was only a slight smudge on the back bumper.  Later the Saturn service department checked out the frame for me, but there was no damage.  These cars are indeed designed to handle minor impacts beautifully.

I do recommend the black bumper over the painted one.  <br><br>
