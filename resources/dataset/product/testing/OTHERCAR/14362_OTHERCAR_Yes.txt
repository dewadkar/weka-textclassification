            I just bought a 2000 Nissan Altima GXE today.I really didn't want to look at any other car manufacturer,because i had a 1996 Sentra XE that was very reliable,good gas mileage,and great value for the price.The only reason i wanted a new car was it had too much mileage,and i wanted more zip on the highway,plus the warranty.
  What can i say about the Altima exept it looks very nice inside and out.Great pickup speed(what a difference from the sentra)i had to put the breaks on a couple of times because i was going 55 in a 45 and didn't realize it.Comes with a lot of features.Looks like a Chrysler LeBaron but cheaper and more reliable.
  The only bad thing i have to say is that i had to trade in my car and bike just to get the monthly figures i wanted,and i spend five hours haggling over the payments........But i got a nice luxury looking car for a allright price.
  If you are looking for a nice looking car for a ok price then go for the Altima.<br><br>
