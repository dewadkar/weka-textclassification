            I have a 1991 Silver Thunderbird, this is one of the best cars we have ever owned.   We have never had to do anything major to it, it has been a real good car, it has over 145,000 miles on it and I would still trust it to take us anywhere. 

My Thunderbird is an automatic with a V6 engine.  It's a two door which I thought might be a problem when my daughter was an infant, getting her in and out of the carseat, I thought would be a problem, but the doors are a nice size for easy access to the back seat.  This was perfect for me since we did use the backseat alot and I don't like four door cars, four doors are fine, but I just prefer two door.

This car is now going on 10 years old and we just replaced the battery last week, the only other thing we have done to this car is change the oil and bought new tires.  The car runs good, drives real smooth, this has been my favorite car. 

The car does need a good tune-up right now &quot;some plugs and wires and maybe some new filters&quot; but thats OK, after 10 years of running good I think it deserves some new plugs and wires.   The body on the car also still looks good, there is no rust spots nowhere, when I tell some people that its a 91' they can't believe its that old. 

This really has been a good car and I plan on driving it for a little while longer.  <br><br>
