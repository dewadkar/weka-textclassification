            The new 2003 Expedition is great; that is once I got to the second one I bought!  

I was involved in an accident on Christmas Eve that "totaled" my 1998 Chevy Blazer.  So I was concerned about my survival in another collision.  Big was better, so I bought the 2003 Expedition - Eddie Bauer.

There is a tale to tell about my purchase.  I actually had to buy two Expeditions to get one without problems.  The first one I purchased had a vibration.  The dealer tried to balance tires, a torque adjustment on the rear end, two new tires...   Needless to say I was concerned.  

During the first two weeks of my ownership the Expedition was in the dealer's shop for 11 days.  To their credit, they gave me another Expedition to drive during that time, and those drove great.

Net answer was when they told me they had to take the rear end out I was concerned - I was never going to like this vehicle.  I saw the vehicle on the lift and there was no axle, differential or wheels.  Only the disk brakes were hanging down!

I went to the Dealership General Manager and told him of my concern.  Fortunately, the vehicle was not titled as yet and I did not have a lien against it.  The dealership went out of their way to find me another Eddie Bauer with the same features and we did a swap.  The new one drives like a dream.  

One consideration should be when was the vehicle built.  I found out the first Expedition was built in May of 2002.  The vehicle was part of the start up run.  This is where Ford does a "build and hold" in order to correct production problems.  The second one was built in November of 2002 outside of that period.

The Expedition style is new, fresh and as a positive in my book - big.  The vehicle has many standard features and is quite pleasant to drive and ride in.  The turning radius is great, and it really does not take up that much more room in my garage.

Overall, make sure you get a good dealer, and you check out when the vehicle was built.
