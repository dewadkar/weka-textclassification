            My dad was the first to suggest looking at the 1991 Escorts when I was looking for a car.  A fully equipped LX hatchback at that time was priced less than other competitors. When I went for a test drive, I found that all the controls were just where my hands expected them.  I didn't have to fumble for dimmer switches or anything like that.

Since then my car has been through a lot.  I forgot a dirt road was being repaved and plowed through about 75 yards of 5 inch deep mud. I have pushed several small cars, helped my wife move about a hundred miles with it, loaded the hatchback with everything from bicycles to lawnmowers. After 9 years the car still gets good gas mileage: about 25 city and 30+ highway.  

On the down side it is not possible to get a full 4 wheel alignment on the car.  There is a fixed bar on the right rear wheel that would have to be replaced with an adjustable one. I have had to put a new clutch in the car, but that was due to pushing the aforementioned cars. The air conditioner needs to be serviced about every 3 years and is currently not working.

On the whole, my '91 Escort LX hatchback has been a great car.  It has done everything I ever asked of it and occasionally surprised me by
doing things it really was not intended to do.  I can't understand why Ford would discontinue such a great line of cars.
