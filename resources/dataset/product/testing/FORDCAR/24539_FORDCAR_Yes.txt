            I've been leasing a Ford F150, extended cab with 3rd door, 2 wheel drive, manual transmission truck for 18 months.  

I initially leased this vehicle because it had a really good monthly payment and lots of room.  Now, I like my truck for a variety of reasons.  
*It rides very nicely, 
*I can have four passengers comfortably, 
*it is beautiful and 
*it is powerful.  

In the 18 months I've had it, I have developed an antifreeze leak, but no other problems.  I have it outside all Minnesota winter and it always starts.  It warms up well and cools off fast with the air conditioning.  Even with 2 wheel drive, I have no problems getting through snow.  

I am especially glad to have this pick up when I need to tote large items.  (Many of our city friends enjoy this option as well.)  

When I am transporting small children, the front passenger airbag can be shut off.  I did have some problems fitting an infant carseat in this vehicle, however, and would not recommend transporting children in carseats.  

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone wanting a smooth ride in a roomy, powerful vehicle with the convenience of a pick up.  

The 3rd door on the passenger side is a must!<br><br>
