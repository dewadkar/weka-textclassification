            This is my first experience with owning an suv and I feel after much
investigation I have made an excellent choise.  Not only am I happy, but
my wife also loves to drive this vehicle. She felt that it might be large for her, but has changed her mind.  We have been driving it for over 7000
miles and have had no trouble with the vehicle.  It handles well on the openroad and does well in traffic.  After all the complaints I've heard aboutother suv's, I am pleased to add a positive one for the Ford Explorer.<br><br>
