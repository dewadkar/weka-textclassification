            When we purchased our Ford Windstar, we were looking for something fairly reasonable in price and that would accommodate our family of 5. 
Those two things we got, and thats about it.

We kept it for about 19 months and it was in the shop about a dozen times, and they couldn't seem to understand why were so upset with it.

It had a variety of problems I'll tell you about some, some were minor and some not so minor.
The very first day we owned it it had to go back because the locks were all keyed different, every single one of them...that should've been our sign to take it right back !
We also had to take it back because the windshield was crooked..quick fix, not in the shop long.
About 7 times or more we took it in because the gas tank which was supposed to be 25 gals. would collapse in on itself.  Not a danger, but a nuisance to say the least.
This was something they never did figure out and they kept it in the shop various amounts of time for this problem, one time it was in for 3 entire weeks !!!
The straw that broke the camels back was when at 30,000 miles the transmission went out. It went completely out while driving, even at flooring it you couldn't get above about 30 mph. and from my cell phone I called the service dept. and they tried to tell me they didn't have any openings for 2 wks, not the answer I was looking for while stranded on the side of the road with a 1 1/2 yr old !!!

We never received satisfactory service at the dealership which also contributed to the problem.
I will probably never own another Ford based on my experience with the Windstar.<br><br>
