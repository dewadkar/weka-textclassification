            This is a 97 model Expedition.  I have 60,000 miles on it.  I bought it because I wanted a large SUV, one that I could be comfortable in.  It has met those needs very well.  It is a good riding vehicle.  I have had problems with the rear windshield wiper that turned out to be the turn on switch on the column.  I really like the size of the truck, I can do a lot of things with the available room in the rear.  I also have the 3rd seat and that comes in handy when moving a large group of family around.  The truck has done everything I have needed it to and I like the leather, CD player and dual zone Air Conditioning.  Mileage is not as good as I would like (14 to 17 MPG), but it is a big vehicle that is heavy and catches a lot of wind.  Driving this vehicle is like driving an extended cab truck.  Not to hard to get around and you can still park in a regular parking spot at the Mall.  Getting in and out of the vehicle can be an effort, it sits very high for a two wheel drive vehicle.  My mother has a very hard time getting in and out (climbs in and falls out).  I don't have the running boards, that might help.  Overall, I am very pleased with the SUV.<br><br>
