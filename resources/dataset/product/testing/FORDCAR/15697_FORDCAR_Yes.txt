            Okay, I will be the first one to admit to making fun of minivans.  Both my husband and I swore we would never buy one of those &quot;mom-mobiles&quot;.  Then, a remarkable thing happened........our first child was born.  After two years of stuffing that blasted carseat in a Nissan Sentra and a Ford Tempo, we finally came to the conclusion that we needed a bigger car.  Oh, yes, we looked at SUV's but, to be honest, they didnt have as much room as a minivan.  We bought our '95 Ford Windstar used in 1997.  I am now salting my crow that I have to eat.  I love this car!  First, I like the looks of it....very sleek, unlike the boxy Aerostars.  Second, this baby hauls butt!!!  My husband teases me constantly that I am the only woman who drives a minivan like a race car.  We have had very good luck with Fords.  We drove our Tempo for eight years with little problems.  The same with our Windstar.  Just routine maintenence. It is much easier to put carseats in this car, especially now that we have two carseats to put in.  It has great cargo space and even comes with a roof rack, in case you fill up the back, say, like on a camping trip.  We have fit myself, my daughter, my husband, my dad and my mom all comfortably on daytrips up the California coast.  I personally have had no problems with this car. The only real drawback to the Windstar is the gas mileage.  But, the way we solve that is I drive the van and my husband drives our economy car (Nissan Sentra) to work.  Since I work from home, I dont put as many miles on the van and use less gas, which helps in this horrible gas crunch.  So, if you have a family and are tired of stuffing carseats, kids, groceries, etc, into a small car but are reluctant to buy a &quot;mom-mobile&quot;, I would really suggest that you check out the Windstar. <br><br>
