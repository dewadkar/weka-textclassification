            When the new millennium arrived, several car manufacturers around the world started to promote their line as the <i>new millennium edition vehicles</i>. The U.S., on the other hand, did not have an attractive market for such an idea. The population was still split over the idea of when the millennium actually arrived, and since new model vehicles usually arrive in the summer of the previous year, waiting for the party at the end of the year was not an attractive idea. What of the EPA rules that would be broken due to excess pollution levels? What of the steep fines for gas guzzlers overstepping their limits on mpg laws? No way!

Well, 2000 has arrived and Ford was still guilty for not coming in with a <b>blast</b>. Their 2000 line was not much different than '99, so for <b>2001</b>, they have added a whole new model. Well, <i>sort of</i>: the new vehicle is actually a cross between an SUV and a pick-up truck: the Ford Explorer Sport Trac.

The Explorer is the leading SUV sold in the US market, so why try something new when you can carry on what is doing so well? Comparable to Toyota's idea of adding the Solara onto the Camry line, Ford has now expanded further onto the SUV market.

The Explorer Trac I drove was a glowing red 2WD model with ABS brakes, a 4-liter V6 engine with 205 hps, and a 5-speed automatic transmission. Some std. equipment is a radio with a CD player, A/C, power windows and door locks, and a power rear window.

I liked the idea of the truck-like bed on the back, and the 240 lb-ft engine seemed to do well in both city and the freeway (15 mpg avg.); yet, I found the engine a bit noisy, and unless you only plan to carry very short pieces of wood or your weekend get-away bikes, there's not much room for anything else. If you plan on carrying some stuff on a trailer, might as well just go for a V8 Explorer and travel in much more room and style (though there are much better SUVs out there -- in terms of luxury).

<b>LOOKS</b>:

The looks of this SUV are a bit off to me. The front is cool and the open bed in the back is a nice change of style, but the wheel arcs, in my opinion, are just plain ugly. If you plan on using some big, fat tires -- that's great. But with the original tires I drove on, they seemed ridiculous. Writing about tires, I can't recall whether they were in that Firestone recall or not. I'll ask my neighbor about it sometime.

Safety is always a big deal for me, and the Explorer Trac features front and side airbags. Side airbags are especially nice if this SUV decides to roll, though I'm not sure if they'd activate or not. Side airbags are very choosy, depending on the brand of airbag and where the car manufacturer installs the sensors, whether they get fired up or not.

Finally, my conclusion is that I really liked this car. It's different than what's out there, the ride is smooth, the 5-gear transmission is a welcome change from just 4 (for an automatic), and the car is very roomy, front and back. Ford is also great about extra compartments for your personal stuff. And if you are really going off-road, this SUV packs a full-sized spare tire!
