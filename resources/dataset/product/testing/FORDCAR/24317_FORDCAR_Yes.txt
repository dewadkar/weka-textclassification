            I bought a Ford Escort new in 1994. I bought it because it was all I could afford at the time. I was extremely pleased that I made the decision. It is a fun little car. My friends all remark that it still looks brand new! The paint is as good as the day it left the factory. I enjoy driving it. It has the power assisted rack and pinion steering that makes for easy handling. There is a bit of road noise to it. But, I expected that. I have not acquired the rattles that they say to expect. On the highway, I have gotten 35 miles to the gallon. Most controls are all driver friendly. The stereo sounds good, but the controls leave a bit to be desired. The ashtray is in an inconvenient spot, as is the lighter. To get at them, you may not have a beverage in the console drink holders. The drink holders are not deep enough. It has an automatic seatbelt and it is hard to locate the beginning of the lap belt. It is too far down and back. Those are miner problems compared to the high reliability of this car. I own the 3 door hatchback and it is plenty roomy with the back seats down. I have 3 medium sized dogs that fit in there with no crowding. I have sat in the back seat and found that it had enough room and comfort for me. I have not had a single mechanical problem with it. The engine looks like it is brand new. I would not recommend this for a family car, but it has served my husband and I well. Now that I can afford a new car, I don't want one. I will keep what I have come to enjoy and trust.<br><br>
