            Pros: I bought the vehicle based almost completely on the price after rebate. It is relatively energetic - although you wouldn't want to pull out in front of a fast moving semi, runs well and gets good gas mileage.  Also, there is a surprising amount of hauling space with the fold down seats.  The seats are pretty comfortable, although not as comfortable as I recall them being in older model escorts.  The sedan styling is a great improvement over the hatchback in terms of appearance - most people have to ask me what it is and are surprised at the answer.

Cons:  There is a serious lack of elbow room and little place to set anything.  The ashtray fits into the drinkholder and it hard to reach with any accuracy and because of the center emergency brake there is no console space.  There is a very small slot behind the cup holders but all that fits in it is sunglasses.<br><br>
