            The ford explorer is the most sold SUV in the United States and there is a reason for that. You basically get a lot of vehicle for your money.

The ford explorer comes in a range of version, sports (2 doors) and the standard version with 4 doors. There are 2 engine sizes, the 4l V6 engine and the 5l V8 engine. The vehicle comes with either 4WD or 2WD.

This review is referring to ford explorer is a 1999, 2WD with a 4l V6 engine.

The car is extremely comfortable to drive and handles well. The strenght of the car is great. Never any problems mechanical. It is powerful and can handle heavy duty jobs such as pulling cars, trailers, campers etc. It is a true multi-purpose family vehicle at an affordable price.

Gas prizes are unfortunately soaring these days and that makes it probably more and more attractive to choose vehicles with smaller and more economic engines. The ford explorer V6 goes around 300 miles on a tank (20 gal.)... that is only 15 miles per galon. SUV's, trucks and other heavy vehicles rarely have the best suspension that you could hope for. The explorer is the same... and you can feel small bumps and holes in the road very easily. This is something you get used to very quickly and it is not until you get back in a small vehicle that you really notice. Some explorer's comes with a/c on the rear seat, that is a feature worth going for. It is a large cabin and it can get rather hot in the back. Especially for people with children.

As any vehicle, the ford explorer has its pros and cons. But certainly more pros than cons. You get a great vehicle for a great price and you get 100's of thousands of miles out of it... wouldn't be surprised to some of them doing 1-2 million miles.
