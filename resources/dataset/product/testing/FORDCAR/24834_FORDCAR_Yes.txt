            Want power? 
Want a convertable? 
Want it under 30k?

While the Chrysler Sebring fits this bill of good you would be insane to
not look at the Ford Mustang 2000 GT Convertable. A test drive should make you forget about all the contenders, at least within this price range. Sure the Sebring is more comfortable overall but a quick blast from 2nd to 3rd will leave you wanting more. 

The 2000 GT is everything a Mustang could be, add the rag top and you are ready for spring. In the up position the car is remarkably quiet inside, allowing you to hear the Mach stereo in fine fashion. Drop the top and you can get the wind-in-the-hair blast you buy a convertable for. At highway speeds be prepared for some buffeting. I recommend the aftermaket windscreen for anyone who drives the highways with the top down. 

The 4.6 liter engine is every bit as powerful as the old 5.0 (302) but make no mistakes, this engine mated to the 5-speed is very potent. All the
car lacks is a blistering top end. The rated ~270 feels very lacking in 5th (aka gas-milage-gear). Rumor has it a rear end gear change will put cruising speed, 60ish, right around the power band. I would probably agree with that. Pull the intake snorkle, pop in a K&amp;N filter, add a hypertech chip and you are in cobra territory.

The Mustang is so much more refined than earlier models while retaining the American muscle car feel of earlier cars. It will be nice to see what the Sebring gets for power in 2001 but I could not wait. I bought the Mustang.<br><br>
