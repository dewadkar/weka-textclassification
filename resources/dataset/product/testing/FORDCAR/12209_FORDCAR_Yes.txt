            I'll start this off by saying my previous car was a 1993 Ford Tempo.  It had been driven very hard and purchased for $900.  As you could imagine, it would be hard for ANY vehicle to compare to that jewel.  I found one quite by accident.

The Tempo had done itself in, costing more to fix than it was worth.  I'm only 18, and I live with my parents, but my job is a 30-minute drive away from my house.  Neither of my parents wanted to be left without a car while they were at work.

So I ended up going emergency car shopping with my Father and Brother.  We traveled from lot to lot and were about to give up for the day.  It was looking like I was going to end up with something like an Escort Zx2..this is something I would not have been happy with.

Then my brother discovered it toward the back of the lot.  It was a 1994 Thunderbird LX, with the V8, leather, moon roof, traction and cruise control.  The paint on the window said $7800.  The car was in an immaculate condition, and only had 55k miles on it.  When a salesman finally approached us, I knew I had to drive that car.

The test drive was short, but I quickly learned that this was a VERY nice car.  After much haggling, we were able to get the price down to $7300.  Yahoo!

Anyway, the car as a very adequate amount of power and handles wonderfully.  It does, however, suffer from a common affliction.  Many Thunderbirds experience a shutter around 30-40 MPH and again at 60-70.  This particular car does, and what causes it is some problem with the torque converter.  I hear that getting the transmission flushed and filled with synthetic fluid will fix this problem.  I'll see soon.

All the luxury features of the car are very nice.  The leather seats are comfortable, and keyless entry is a dream.  One of the cooler things is the rear view mirror; it darkens when headlights are shined in it.  Pretty sharp, eh?

My biggest problem with the car is the gas mileage.  I'm not sure, but it seems to get about 18 city and 23 or 24 highway.  Of course, being that it is a large car with a large engine, this would be expected.  Going from the Tempo to this was quite a shock.

At any rate, I am extremely happy with this car.  It is much nicer than anything else I could have gotten for the price.  I must warn you though, if you are looking for a hot rod, this car, although fairly quick, will not suit your needs.
