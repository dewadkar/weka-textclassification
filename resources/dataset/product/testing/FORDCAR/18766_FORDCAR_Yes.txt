                  <b>R</b>edesigned in 1995, and sold with its predecessor during that year, the current styled F-150 came out in 1996. For 2002 the F-150 Supercab comes in 6 different models, the XL, the XLT, and the Lariat models. Ford's F-150 pickup is currently America's best-selling truck and carrying the 'Ford' nameplate is obviously not the reason. This truck offers the brute strength of a traditional pickup, yet can be specified with comfort and convenience options most often found in expensive luxury cars.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

  <b>My test F-150</b> was a 'Lariat Stylside Supercab'. Despite a 202 horsepower SOHC 4.2 liter V6 engine being its base engine, my test truck came with the 260 horsepower SOHC 5.4 liter Triton V8. This particular engine (so I was told by the dealer) is very hard to find in these trucks, it could have been just a sales pitch, but apparently only certain dealers will have it. Also this engine is only available with a 4-speed automatic. This engine of course is an option, an option that will run you almost $2,000. It seems that with each passing design, the F-150 becomes more car-like. The 5.4 liter Triton V8 is very quiet, refined, and offers plenty of low down torque making light work of steep hills, and passing giant 18-wheelers. 

<b>Acceleration</b> from the light is amazing for a truck, I did not have a radar gun with me during my test drive ( ha ha), but my guess is, is that 0-60 comes before 9 seconds under full throttle. The automatic is smooth shifting, shifts are hardly felt under normal acceleration. 

<b>Handling & braking</b> are both superb. Driving through the Avenue of the Giants on 'Old Highway 101' was a snap, almost as easy to tackle as with a midsized car. Best of all though, is the levels of refinement. This truck is outstandingly refined for a full sized pickup; there's a smooth ride with minimal vibration and wind noise. 

 <b>About the engines:</b> Gone are the pushrod V6 and V8 units that were found in the F-150s predecessor, in their place are 3 new engines. These engines include a 4.2 liter SOHC Triton V6 that produces an adequate 202 horsepower, a Triton 4.6 SOHC that produces 231 horsepower, and the top of the line Triton 5.4 liter SOHC engine that produces a healthy 260 ponys. These 2 V8s are part of Ford's modular family. Both engines are cast iron units, with a single overhead camshaft per bank, and sequential electronic fuel injection.  

  Unfortunately I was only able to drive the 2WD model and not the 4WD model. The F-150's front <b>suspension</b> consists of Macpherson struts and lower A-arms, while at the rear, the live axle is suspended by multi leaf springs. For 2002 the Lariat Supercab and all F-150s come standard with 4 wheel disc brakes, with 4 wheel ABS.


<i>Interior Innovation:</i>  

  The <b>interior</b> of the 2002 Ford F-150 is world class! The smart, 'car-like' cabin is comfortable and offers plenty of storage space. There is room for 5 adults, and although a little cramped in the back, the front has more than adequate creature space. The seats are 'super' comfortable and supportive. An option in my test truck was tan leather, with 8 way power seating. Power everything was also included. The stock stereo system was very clear sounding, I could not really crank it up, the sales man was kind of a jerk after he found out I was not going to by the truck, and after letting me floor it at a stop light, he was not about to let me do any hardcore amenity testing. Ergonomics are perfect! You will be pleasantly surprised just how well everything is laid out in the 2002 F-150. I already mentioned amenities, but I want to say again, this truck is loaded to the gills! Even with standard equipment, the truck has a cold AC, daytime running lamps, dual airbags, and a plethora of other amenities normally just options on other trucks in this class. A 5-speed manual is standard with the lesser engines, but with the 5.4 only a 4- speed automatic is available. 

<b>Note:</b> <i>Dodge offers 5-speed automatics with their trucks.</i>

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

 The <b>exterior</b> has not changed much since its re-introduction in 1995. There are flush mounted headlights, a locking rear tail gate, and a very rounded body. The grille is chromed with a blue Ford oval smack dab in the middle. Although this design is going on its 7th year, it still looks fresh, even today.

  The <b>price</b> of the 2002 Ford F-150 Lariat Supercab, with the 5.4 liter engine will run you almost $26,000. At least that is what the sticker said on my test truck. If you want more information on price and reliability check out <b>Consumer Reports.ORG</b>, or <b>Cars.Com</b>. I would give you a full report on reliability, but I do not own this vehicle, for now, I only drool at that thought.
