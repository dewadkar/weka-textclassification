            I own a 1998 Ford Escort SE Wagon.
Being a difficult vehicle to locate on a sales lot, I thought this must be a &quot;hot&quot; seller.   
I like the mileage i get in a tankful of gas.  I can drive approximately 250 miles before needing a fill up.  (this does translate to less than the sticker quote, however).  The car has been very reliable, as a matter of fact, my husband and I drove it up Mount Washington in New Hampshire with only 500 miles on it.  It did great.  I was most appreciative of the compact size while traveling the narrow mountain road!
I like the split rear seat for cargo larger than the rear storage area.  I very much like that the seatbelts were designed with children and car seats in mind.  Once you &quot;lock&quot; the belt by pulling it out all the way, it stays put.  I like not having to worry if the belt has loosened.  
I would suggest however, for those with families, to consider the size of the vehicle before purchasing.  I bought the car while I only had one child.  I found it difficult to bring all of the &quot;baby&quot; equipment without losing all storage space.  As my daughter grew and we needed to bring less equipment, it was ok.But now I am expecting another child and feel that I need to purchase a larger vehicle to adequately meet the needs of my growing family.  This is my only great concern with the vehicle.  
I would recommend consideration of this car when shopping for vehicles, but with the &quot;compact&quot; description highlighted to the purchaser.
