            The Ford Aspire came out in 1994 basically as a redesigned Festiva. Although this car is no Cadillac (or Taurus for that matter), it certainly seems a step up from the Festiva.I have been surprised at how reliable my 1994 Ford Aspire has been. After 6 years the only thing I have had done is the front brakes and a new battery (besides regular maintenance). I did have the tires all replaced when a chunk of metal on the freeway went through one. The factory tires are tiny 12" ones. Fortunately, the tire store replaced them with a more standard 13" size which also improved the handling a lot. Just last spring I drove it 1400 miles from Seattle Washington to the Siskyous in California, going over some pretty steep mountain passes. The four door version has an amazing amount of room for the size of the exterior. I had it full of suitcases and camping equipment. 
Lower your number of speeding tickets - drive this car! It only has 67 horsepower which is the lowest I have ever heard of besides old Volkswagen Beetles. It is sufficient for most needs however..it did make that trip! Now that the price of gasoline has gone up significantly, I like my fuel efficient car even more. People call my car the "Easter Egg" sometimes, but I am going to drive my "don't laugh it's paid for" car until it croaks. At this rate, it might be a while!
