            This Sports utility Vehicle is a very reliable vehicle. I rented one for a week and drove it from LA to Las Vegas, Las Vegas to Death Valley, Death Valley Back to LA. Went off road and it stood up to everything. love the flip switch 4 wheel drive. The only problem I found with this SUV was the lack of back support. It was great on the short drive but on the long drives. Oh man did it hurt my back. I also liked the stock cd player. <br><br>
