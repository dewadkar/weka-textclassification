            I have owned a 93 ford probe SE for over a year now, and have put around 20K miles on it.  Here are the problems i have learned to look out, not only from driving the car, but also working in a car dealership for 3 years.

Here are the pros to the 93 SE:
-good gas mileage in 5th gear
-surprisingly quick for a 4 cyl.
-good handling
-sharp looks, both inside and out

Cons to the 93 SE:
-Soft 3rd gear-ford has been known to make soft 3rd gears in their probes and mustangs.  If yours starts to grind when putting it into gear, SELL IT!  It will eventually wear down to nothing
-Soft rims, plan on replacing these aluminum rims every time you hit a pothole or curb
-Cheap clutches, certainly not recommended for aggressive street driving 
-Expensive parts replacements, most or all of the probe's parts are made overseas. just the parts cost for an alternator or headlight motor can reach $200.
-small backseat
-rear hatch hydraulics almost always fail on older probes
