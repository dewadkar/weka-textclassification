            The Ford Explorer is the perfect size for a family of four or five, leaving room in the back for all of their gear.  This SUV is so safe that you could give it to a new driver, without having any worries about how they would handle it.  It handles great both off and on the road.  It has a lot of leg room and extra amenities, making this the perfect family car (so the kids won't be right on top of each other, fighting).  Since it is higher up than a car, this SUV is also great for short drivers, who have a hard time seeing over the dashboard and onto the road, therefore making it safer.  Moreover, driving this vehicle is easy, with a smooth and comfortable ride.  Similarly, the looks and features of this car boost the enjoyment.  I recommend the Ford Explorer to anyone who needs a bigger car or just wants a great-looking, smooth-riding, safe SUV.<br><br>
