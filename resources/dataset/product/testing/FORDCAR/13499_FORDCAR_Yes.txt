            This is my second Ford Explorer which I purchased in July.I really enjoyed my first Explorer and never had any problems with it.I love that it has so much room. I have put the back seat down and moved furniture it is amazing how much you can actually put in at one time!For me there is nothing to hate. It is easy to drive and handles like a dream whether in town or on the interstate.Also the 4-wheel drive is a real plus.This is truly a vehicle for every one.Whether a senior as I am or a family since it is so versatile. 


I Highly Recommend Ford Explorer!<br><br>
