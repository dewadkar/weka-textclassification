            When I went shopping for my first car, I was looking for 2 things. A car that had a decent warranty and had a good price. I found both in my Ford Escort GT. The warranty never came into use for the 3 months I had it and today, over a year after buying it, I have had no problems with the car.

The car itself handles well and has pretty decent horsepower for a car its size (127 for the GT). For a '91 car, it's built very well and has good features. My Escort has cruise control, power steering, and a moonroof along with assorted others. While other Escorts don't have all these features, there are a few out there that do.

There isn't too much space in the cabin, so don't expect to haul a ton of stuff or carry a lot of people. It's a very comfortable ride for the two front passengers but not anyone in the back seats. It is a hatchback, so a little creative packing could happen if you took off the cover. I recommend it for a college student that doesn't haul too much all the time.

The stereo is not very high quality so your best bet is to add an aftermarket stereo to this car. I did and I'm very happy with the results. I replaced all the speakers myself and it was quite simple, so if you want to save money, concider doing yourself. The front supports speakers 6 1/2 and the back 4 or 5's, so you can get decent sound.

The car also gets good milage, so you won't spend too much for gas, but the tank is small (13.2 gallons), so don't expect to feel the added milage too much. The ride is a little rough but is to be expected for a small GT car. With the decent horsepower, going fast is no problem at all.

With all the things you get from this car, it's really worth the price you pay for it. You'll get a very decent car for the money.<br><br>
