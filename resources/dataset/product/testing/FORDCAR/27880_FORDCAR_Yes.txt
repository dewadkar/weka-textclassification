             This truck is unstoppable, my brother bought it in Calgary about 6 years ago and since then it has been across Canada 3 times and has had some hard rural driving the rest of the time.  This truck was treated like a truck! it has hauled everything and has been everywhere and it shows no signs of letting up anytime soon.  
 It's got the 4.0 liter engine, 5 speed manual transmission, 6 speaker sound system, and that's it for the options, spash decal on the side, tinted windows, sliding rear window, short box, alunimum rims, and is a metallic green in color.  This truck was very sharp in it's day but wear and tear has taken a toll on the look of the truck.  
 The 4.0 engine and the small size of the truck gives it lots of pep.  You can catch 3 gears with the man transmission and it can stay with Mustangs and Camaros in races, I've taken care of a few Civics with it myself.  It's hard to keep back tires on it with so much pep, you want to spin em on every turn.
 I've put 40,000 kms on this truck myself and with minimal work, I've put a ball joint on and replaced a thermostat, also the exhaust had to be replaced.  
 I would definatly recommend this truck and if I could find another one just like it in new condition and low kms I would buy it in a second.
