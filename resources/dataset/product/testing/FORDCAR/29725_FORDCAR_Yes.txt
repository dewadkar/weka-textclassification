            The 1994 Ford Bronco is really one of a kind.  My favorite part about my 1994 Ford Bronco Eddie Bauer Edition are the seats. They are by far the most comfortable seats in any car I have ever driven.  I got this truck from where I work. It was used as a workhorse truck, and I got it when it had 125,000 miles on it. I have driven it for almost another 10,000 miles and it drives like its brand new.  The interior is extremely roomy and spacious. Ford really made this a driver friendly truck.  I was surprised to learn how nicely the Bronco handles turns, especially in parking lots- it's got a great turning radius.  The 5.8 Liter V8 engine purs when it drives down the road.  It's extremely powerful and the automatic four wheel drive is a dream come true. It gets me through anything- snow, mud, and all other kinds of rough terrain that the road might throw at me, right at the push of a button.  Cruise control is located right on the steering wheel and is also very easy to work.  As long as you check your oil often and have proper mechanic check ups on your Bronco, you shouldn't have any problems with them. Mine is very reliable and starts right up everyday, even in extremely cold temperatures. The heating and air conditioning are also very good. My Bronco has a 28 gallon gas tank. While the truck tends to guzzle a lot of gas, one tank of gas will get you pretty far. If you're gonna have a V8 engine in any vehicle, you're going to end up spending the money anyway.  Ford trucks from around this year don't handle bumps in the road to well either- so hold on to that steering wheel tight. All in all, I plan on getting another 60,000 miles on my Bronco. I don't think its going to be easy to part with my Bronco- its a FANTASTIC American truck, it doesn't get any better than a 1994 Ford Bronco!
