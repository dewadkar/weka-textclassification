            When you're 5'3&quot;, it's hard to find a car that &quot;fits.&quot;  I first test drove this car when I was eight months pregnant, and all you mothers out there know how hard it is to just get IN the car.  I've driven quite a few cars and I have never before had felt such comfort behind the wheel.

The seats move in ways that most cars don't, and the steering wheel telescopes for a perfect driving feel.  Also, the seats are higher up so you have a better view of the road, even if you have short legs.  The great thing about the Focus is that it easily adjusts for the taller person, too.

We drove about six different models at different car lots in my area.  My favorite was the ZTS Sony Focus.  This car has an awesome sounding system that any music lover (or Sony lover) can appreciate.  The first Sony Focus I drove had cloth seats and was in a very nice dark gold color.  The dealer told us it didn't come in any other color (that was the specialty Sony color) and that you couldn't get leather or a moonroof.  But in less than two hours I was cruising in an all leather black moonroof equipped Sony Focus.  I love everything about this car.  It's also very quiet when you're not jamming the Sony system!

I didn't sit in the back seat, but there looked like plenty of room for the family.  I own an 89 Ford Escort right now, but I'm saving up for that Focus!
