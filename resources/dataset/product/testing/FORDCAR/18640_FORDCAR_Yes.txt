                 I own a 1993 Festiva GL, but it isn't my first Festiva, before I drove A 1990 Festiva L. I know this car very well, I have spend my last 7 years with it, and I am very impressed. I bought my first one in 1994 because I needed something to drive to school.  
     It was the best car for me because it makes about 38 miles from a gallon of gasoline, and the insurance can't be any lower than this. I've driven it a lot, every day, it never disappointed me and never broke down. My car has a manual transmission and i love that about it. 
    This 1.3L 63 Horsepower engine is perfect for this light car. Of course it's not a race car, but it's perfect for the city. The car drives very well if you take car of it. (change brake pads, oil, etc. regularly). It's not the safest car, especially for highway, but you can easily go 85 mph, on either 4th or 5th gear.
    In the front you have more room than in some family sedans, though the back seat could be a little bit bigger. I think this car is a great buy, especially for some high school or college students. It's a perfect &quot;First Car&quot;. Overall it's a good economic and I'll stick with it for the next couple of years.<br><br>
