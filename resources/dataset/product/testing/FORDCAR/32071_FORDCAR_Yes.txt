            I own a 1996 ford explorer xlt with leather seats and a CD player. This is a great overall SUV. It can hold lots of cargo because the back seats can fold down. Also, This car is very dependable. I've had this car for over four years and I've had no real trouble with it. Except for the minor tune up's and such -- I've had no serious problems. I bought this car because i was looking for a sporty SUV that can hold a decent amount of gear because I like to camp. Well I found it!

I would recommend this SUV to anyone looking for a dependable one that will last.
