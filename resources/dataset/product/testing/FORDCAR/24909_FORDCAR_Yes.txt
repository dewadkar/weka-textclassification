            I am an avid mustang enthusiast and I must say that the '87-93 model years of mustangs are definitely my favorite for many reasons.  I have owned 2 of these model year stangs.  Both were great cars, one of which I currently own and love.  I also have lots of friends who are also into these year mustangs for basically the same reasons as I am. I'm not here to say that they are the end all of automobiles, because to be honest they aren't.  The value is in what they offer for their relatively low-cost in used form.  They offer tremendous fun to drive, performance, as well as good looks in an affordable package.  I am also like many of my friends in that I like to be able to work on my stang when I want to instead of having to pay the Ford dealership all the time.  This is something that is lost in the more complex new stangs.  The newer year mustangs are better suited to someone, who would rather pay someone to service they're stangs.  Performance is obviously a very big factor when choosing a sports car.  In this department, the 5.0 liter mustang still contends with today's current sports cars in many ways.  Also, the incredible aftermarket, which stands behind the 5.0 liter engine and drivetrain make personalizing your pony very easy.  Everything from complete body kits to custom built suspension systems are available for mustangs.  This again is something I like, in that you can make your 5.0 into whatever you want it to be.  Whether that be a custom painted show car, a street performance terror, or just a great weekend car.  Me and my friends are always upgrading, installing, or testing new parts on our mustangs.  I love the option of upgrading anything that you aren't totally happy with.  Well, obviously I could go on forever about this.  The simple fact, however, is that the 5.0 liter mustangs are still the &quot;bang for the buck&quot; kings of the streets.<br><br>
