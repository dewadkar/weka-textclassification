            I bought my 1986 ford TAURUS sedan in 1995, the car had 72,000+ miles on the odometer. I love the way it handles in all kinds of weather,I also love the fact that it has 153,000+ miles on it now,and it hasn't given us a bit of trouble since we bought it. (we paid $2000.for it.)When I drive my TAURUS it is like driving a big luxury car, but at less than half the cost. I have driven newer vehicles,but I love  my TAURUS.If you looking for a good,reliable means of transportation,please consider buying a FORD TAURUS. I don't regret it.                                 THANK YOU<br><br>
