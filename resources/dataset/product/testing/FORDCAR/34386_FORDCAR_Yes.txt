            The only cars I have ever driven are 1995 mustang gt, 1998 ford contour, 1998 ford escort, and 1998 for taurus.  The truth is that the two groupings are similar in a way.  The contour is better than the escort, but overall they are both pieces of garbage.  The mustang was better than the taurus, but dont misunderstand, the taurus held its own.  

When you first get into the drivers seat the little things on this car make it convenient.  The seats are comfy, there's enough space in the back.  The trunk is large, which probably explains the long and sort of wide body.  When driving the contour and escort, the gas pedal was weak like no other.  No power in either of those vehicles.  I assumed the taurus would be the same, but in fact it had power.  The brakes weren't the greatest but the power was awesome.  Everything is conveniently located (cupholders, AC, radio, etc.) just like most cars.  This is the easiest car I've ever driven by far.  It handles superbly and is definitely not a cop nor chick magnet so it can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it.  One of the best features is the beeping.  Whenever you do something stupid (leave your lights on, don't close a door properly) there is this really annoying beeping sound I mean really annoying.  It is, however, very useful in the sense that your battery will not die.  The downfall to this car is the look and the ride.  The ride is way too easy pulls all the fun out of driving.  It looks like every other car except wider and longer.  It's nothing special for any man or woman who doesn't caree just wants reliable transportation.  This is a definite reliable car.  If you have the money to buy this, go with the mustang.  It's a tiny bit more expensive, but way more fun.  The problem with this car is that it's just too average and easy.
