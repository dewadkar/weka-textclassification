             After one year of owning this vehicle and 45000 miles later, I am still perfectly happy. This car delivers great value for your dollar. I am averaging 32 mpg driving mostly on the freeways in Southern California. The only thing I have done to the car so far is standard maintenance, such as oil and filter changes. My driving is considered high maintenance because of the following...1.Cajon Pass, 15 freeway, So. Cal. This highway rises fast from sea level to around 4000 feet altitude. I have no problem climbing this hill every day in the fast lane. I easily cruise up at 70 mph.  2. Where I live, in the High Desert, I do travel a lot of dirt roads. Except for the dirt and grime the paint attracts, this also causes me no problems.
  Because of my driving conditions, the factory reccomends oil changes every 3000 miles. I have been changing at or around 5000. So far so good.

  Good points to consider :-
1. Great price
2. Exceptional &quot;get up and go&quot;
3. No tune up for the first 100,000 miles
4. Great factory warranty

 Bad points to consider :-
1. Small car. Tight squeeze in the back seat and it is tough to get in or out for the back seat passengers.
2. Front side window tends to leak very slightly in a commercial car wash.
3. Overpriced cd player option.

 Overall I am extremely with this car. Up until this Ford, I have only purchased new foreign cars and I must say, this does compete very well.
