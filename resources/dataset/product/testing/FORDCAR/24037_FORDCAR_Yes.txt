              The Ford Expedition is roomy. It can seat up to 8 adults comfortably. We have 3 young children, and our family has plenty of leg room when all of us go anywhere together. The style of the SUV is great too. We have an Eddie Bauer Edition. We have leather interior, power windows, power locks. Dual air bags provide more safety for my family. 
   I really like the 5 doors. The 4 doors make it so accessible for everyone. The back seat can slide out the hatch back to make it easy to carry large items. 
   There are stereo controls behind the front seat consoles for the kids in the back. We don't have to hear &quot;MOM, can you please turn the stereo up!&quot; However, I usually don't mind turning it up, the factory stereo system is awesome. I love to crank it up!!
   The thing I don't like about this vehicle is the gas mileage. It gets low gas mileage, aka GAS HOG. We have seen it as low as 12 miles on the city streets!! On the highway it gets about 14 miles per gallon. And with the gas tank being so large (30 Gallon tank), gas costs run pretty high. 
     Driving the Expedition is great! I feel like I own the road, the bigger the better!! 
  I think this a good vehicle for any family. Especially the family who likes to do outdoor activities. <br><br>
