            I bought my Ford Taurus in 1994 and have loved it every minute since then.  I had been driving a sports car for 12 years and decided I was through that phase of my life and ready for a &quot;real&quot; comfortable car.  I looked at several full size sedans and decided the Taurus was for me.  Now I am not one to buy a new car every 2 or 3 years so I am very picky when I do buy one.  I researched to see what was available and carefully selected the color, interior, engine size, and extra features that I wanted.  Actually, I wanted the biggest possible engine and every luxury feature available.  That is what I got and I have never had a single problem with it.  I almost feel like I wasted my money purchasing the extended warranty.  But, I only have 68,000 miles on it so it might come in handy yet.  It is the most comfortable, most driveable, and largest car I have ever had.  

I do not like the body shapes of the newer models of Taurus.  I think my '94 looks classy and I intend to drive her for a long, long time.<br><br>
