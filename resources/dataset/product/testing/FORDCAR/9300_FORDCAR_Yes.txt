            I bought this Contour SE because my old car died on me.  The Ford company was advertising a sale.  My husband and I looked around at all the cars on the lot, and we liked the Contour the best.  We took a test drive, and we were sold.  I like feeling safe while I'm driving.  It is a very dependable car.  The interior is very comfortable.  The seat fits me like a glove.  The sound system is good.  There are things that I dislike also.  The cup holders are too far down for the driver to reach safely.  The car has a distinct roaring sound while driving down the road.  I wish that it came with a real spare tire.  The car drives very well.  All of the gauges are easy too see.  If you are looking for a sporty car, this one is not for you.  It makes a good family car.<br><br>
