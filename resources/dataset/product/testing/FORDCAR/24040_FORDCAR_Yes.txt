            This truck drives the best on ice and snow of any car I have ever owned.  The ability to switch into and out of Four-Wheel-Drive depending on road conditions is terrific.  You will not get stuck on an icy hill in this baby.  It really hugs the road in snowy conditions.
Since it seats eight, you can squeeze in a fair number of children's car seats--three abreast in the back two seats. Since it's big (and mine's a very visible white), you do feel safer on the road than in a smaller vehicle.  For big families, this is a good alternative to a minivan (and so much more chic).  Though not a car for low-budgets, it is more economy-minded than the Surburban, which seats a similar number of people.
Cornering is tricky on narrow country roads because it tends to feel top-heavy, but after a week or two of driving the Expedition I did not notice this any more.  
The car has needed no repairs in the three years I've owned it.<br><br>
