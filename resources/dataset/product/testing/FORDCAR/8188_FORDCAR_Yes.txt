            Review of Ford Ranger Pickup Truck (June 26, 2000)

I have always been a Chevy man, in the American-made car market.  My first car was an old, used, 1972 Chevy Nova.  I remember spending a bundle on this car &quot;souping it up&quot; to make it look really cool in the early 1980's, only to have the engine die on me shortly afterwards.  My next car was a 1976 Ford Mustang.  Wow! What a car! This car could move, and it did not require much maintenance. 

Several years ago, and some 5 or 6 vehicles after my &quot;early&quot; car days, I was in the market for a pickup truck.  I own a small business, which often requires me to pickup supplies.  I wanted the best small sized, 4-wheel drive pickup truck available, for the least amount of money.  While shopping around, I decided to be impartial to any make or model, and let my good sense be my primary guide.  I set out to visit several dealers, especially the used car dealers.  I wanted to see what the trucks looked like after some use and abuse.

The first pickup truck I tried was a Chevy S10.  This truck was a stinker-ooo.  It had a tinny feel to it when driving.  It lacked power.  The engine was very small, and it seemed to struggle a bit when going up steep hills (especially when I turned on the AC).  The seats were a bit hard and uncomfortable.  The doors were very light weight.  The body had a lot of rust spots on the under side.  I immediately passed this one up.

I next tried the Dodge Dakota.  This truck was much better than the Chevy.  It handled nicely, and zipped up hills with no problems.  I liked this truck's handling very much!   The only problem I found here was, like the Chevy, the truck had rust on the underside, and it did not have a sliding rear window.

I tried all of the Japanese models including Nissan, Toyota, and Mazda next.  These were okay, too.  I liked all of these, especially the Mazda truck.  The biggest problem with the Toyota and Nissan was the interior cabs seemed small to me.   The Mazda was fine, except it had a 4-cylinder engine and it was not automatic.  When talking to the dealer, he informed me that if I liked the Mazda, I should try a 6-cylinder Ford Ranger, since it was essentially the same truck, with a bigger engine.

So, off I went in pursuit of a used Ford Ranger pickup. They were difficult to find used!  I finally found one that some guy traded in (for a new Ford Ranger).  The truck was perfect!  It drives smooth as glass.  It has a powerful 4-liter, 6-cylinder engine that was the most powerful small truck engine I sampled.  The cab was very roomy and the extended cab spacious.  I love the two little fold down seats on either side!

This truck, despite its age, had absolutely no rust spots, and appeared to be in &quot;like new&quot; condition, despite having over 50K miles on the odometer.  The engine was clean, with no oil leakage or anything else dysfunctional.  It also had a nice plastic bedliner.

The major drawback was the air conditioner did not work (no cold air).  Also, I did not care for the way the power windows and power door lock switches are mounted on the doors.  To this day, I always have to fumble for these switches whenever I try to open a window.  

The dealer informed me they would fix the AC for free, if I bought the truck.  So I bought the truck, and it has NEVER had a problem since!  I simply change the oil, rotate the tires, and do other routine maintenance as recommended.   I also replaced the muffler, shocks, and battery since I bought the truck. The truck looks, drives, and sounds great to this date - with over 125K miles.  

Is Ford better than Chevy?  Who knows? Who cares?!!!  However, I do have a funny story to share: One day, my wife and I drove down to the Jersey Shore to visit some friends during the Labor Day weekend.  My wife's friend's husband drove a mid-sized Chevy truck at the time, which he used to tow a small boat trailer.  His truck was a few years newer than mine, and he had just had it repainted to make it look like new.

One day, after fishing all morning, we were driving in his Chevy truck when he started to brag about how great his Chevy truck is.  I ignored his boisterous comments, until he started bad mouthing my Ford Ranger pickup, telling me it was a piece of junk.  We were both drinking beer all day and I usually don't get involved in chicken fights, yet this guy's truck was just as tinny as the Chevy S10 I drove when I was sampling trucks.  Well, he suggested a good test would be to wrap a chain around each of our trailer hitches, and then drive in opposite directions to see whose truck had the most power.  

I admit, this has got to be the most stupid thing I ever got myself involved in, and I would not recommend ever doing this.  But we did.  We drove off to an empty dirt lot, put a heavy-duty chain around both hitches, and set off in opposite directions.  

At first, my rear tires started to dig in to the dirt.  Neither truck went anywhere. Then, I switched to 4-wheel drive, gave it some gas, and started moving forward!  Then, all of a sudden, I was racing forward!  I had pulled his trailer hitch right off of his rear bumper!!!  

We both got out of our trucks, and surveyed the damage.  His bumper was pulled out about two inches, and the metal that held the bolts in place for his hitch were all torn and the holes were stretched.  I did not have a bit of damage on my Ford Ranger.

Well, that's my stupid story.  Needless to say, we both had a big laugh over it, and he now drives a Ford F150.  (His Chevy engine seized several months after the tug-of-war incident).  I do not believe this test proved anything, except that it was fun and stupid.  I would not recommend ever doing this, and I would certainly not ever do this again.  

I'm not going to put down other trucks.  I only know my Ford Ranger pick-up truck is just right for me.  I enjoy driving it, and it has always been dependable for me.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs to haul small loads around, or to anyone who has a small business.  It certainly paid itself off in savings from delivery charges for me alone!  We have also used it to carry our kayaks around (on a special rack I built for the rear bed) and to haul our mopeds around.  Happy trucking!

Mike
