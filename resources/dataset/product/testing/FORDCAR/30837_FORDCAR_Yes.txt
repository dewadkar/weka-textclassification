            We bought a used 1991 Ford Explorer in 1997 basically because we needed a family car with 4WD to get out and about in all the snow of Northern UT.  When we first bought it, it had a few mechanical problems right away, and we were scared we'd bought a lemon.  However, since those few minor problems, we've had good luck. 

When we bought ours, the interior was just like new, and it still is!  It wipes off easily, and the carpet has cleaned up too, believe me my two kids have tested it well. 

While the drive is a little bumpy, it has plenty of power, and is great in snow.  It even pulls well, a pretty big accomplishment since ours is only a V6.

It is a great car for families of four or less.  The back seat is kind of small and there wouldn't be room for more, especially if they're in carseats.  It's also good for rural folks who live in a cold climate; if I lived in warmer weather or the city, I may go with a more gas efficient model.<br><br>
