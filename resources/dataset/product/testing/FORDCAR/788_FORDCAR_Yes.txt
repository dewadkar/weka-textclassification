            Ahh.. Ford F250 Super Duty. The big brother of the F150, but the similarities end there. The F250 is a beast, larger every dimension than the F150, longer, wider, heavier. Large does have it's advantages, if you want to haul anything, than this is your truck. I have had the truck loaded with mulch and then had a 3700 lb car trailer in tow with another full size pickup on the trailer, the beast barely dropped an inch, and the 5.4 gas V8 didn't even break a sweat on the highway. Surprisingly when not loaded, the truck rides fairly decent. The only ride flaw is when you hit a pothole on the highway the frontend tends to bounce rather harshly, which can be a startling surprise if not paying attention.
The interior of this truck is spacious, the standard bench seat has excellent lumbar and leg support even for us taller people, I recommend that you opt for the fold down armrest or split bench for extra storage and comfort. Interior sound level is acceptable.
Flaws: The turning radius is rather wide, so planning is needed in certain situations, when at the grocery, park far out in the lot to avoid the back and forth jockey manuever.
The standard mirrors leave a lot to be desired, blind spots abound, you will need those hokey spot mirrors. The optional mirrors are much better, but stick out so far you will most likely loose one in a fast food drive thru, or by picking off a pedestrian.
The auto transmission is a little sluggish for my taste, but am told that a re-programing is available.
