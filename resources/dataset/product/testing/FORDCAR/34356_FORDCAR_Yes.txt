            I have a 1998 Taurus and have been very happy. I looked for months for a car that i liked and that was affordable. I finally narrowed my decision to either a Ford Contour or the Taurus.

 I decided on the Taurus for many reasons. One big reason was that the Taurus has a lot more room in the seating area. When i got in the back seat of the Contour there was no leg room, the Taurus has plenty. My family and i often go on long trips so this was important. Last month my husband and I and two other adults went on a trip out of state and were very comfortable.

 There are also many features that i like about this car. I like the driver side power seat, so who ever is driving can easily adjust the seat. I also like the express down window, not sure if that is the correct term, but the way you can press it once and the window automatically goes down. One more small feature that i enjoy is when you turn the key once to open the driver door, you can turn it a second time and open all the doors, just a small feature i enjoy that really don't mean much but adds up in the end. 

This car is also powerful and low maintenance. I haven't had to take it to the shop.I've had the oil changed twice, and the tires aligned once. Have been very happy with this purchase. <br><br>
