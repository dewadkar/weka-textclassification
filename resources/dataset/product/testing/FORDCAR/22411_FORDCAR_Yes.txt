            The Ford Escort ZX2 Sport is one of the best cars that Ford has put out in a long time. Who new that an Escort (I mean, look at the '83 models!) could even be considered &quot;sporty&quot;?
It has everything you can ask for- great sound system (the bass is wonderful; I play my music at full volume and have never blown a speaker!), the back seats fold down to make more room in the trunk, looks awesome, great gas mileage (32-35/gallon), enough room for almost 6 people. I could go on and on. 
Maybe it's just WA state, but the other nice thing is that insurance is fairly low on the ZX2 because it's not considered a sports car. But this car just RIPS down the road (no.. I wouldn't know that!..).
So if you're looking around at cars, get a ZX2. They're affordable, too, around the $12,000-$16,000 price range. Can't beat that.
