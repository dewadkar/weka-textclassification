            I have had a 98' Contour for 2 years now and have no regrets.  This car is a dependable solid sporty vehicle.  I would reccomend it to anyway to go by one before it's too late.  They are still making them in Mexico for about 1 more year.  This year you can only get the Contour SE with the V6 Duratec or the SVT.  Ford dropped the 4-cyclinder and all other models of the Contour.  I would reccomend the Silver Frost color as well.  It is easy to wax out any small scrathes and does not show the dirt and grime as much as other colors. 
The only problem I have, and it is a small problem; I cannot change my air filter because one you get the clamps off, it is very difficult to get the clamps reclamped because there is no room from the surrounding engine compartment.  The clamps are also very flimsy and I have noticed that after 2 years of driving, I am missing 1 and they are corroding.  Is anybody else having the same problem?  I dare not let my local oil change shop change my air filter because I don't trust they could clamp it down, as a result I have been forced to take the car into the dealer every other oil change and have them change the filter.
Speaking of oil change, my fiance owns a '99 Volkswagon Cabrio.  She was over mileage for an oil change by only 400 miles, so I decided to check her oil for her.  Well it was a good thing because she was extremely low and I had to go immediately to a gas station for oil.
Meanwhile my '98 Contour was coming almost at the 5,000 mile mark for an oil change so I decided that it would be wise to check my oil as well.  What a surprise, the oil was still full AND clean!!!  I'm tellin you Ford made a big mistake by building and solid dependable car and letting it sit by the wayside with absolutely no marketing.  What a waste!!<br><br>
