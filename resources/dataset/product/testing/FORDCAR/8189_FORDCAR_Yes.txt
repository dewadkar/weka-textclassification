            I bought my red Ford Ranger off of my Uncle while I was looking mostly at cars. Trucks had always appealed to me, and I have driven quite a few. (95 F-150, 98 Silverado, 98 F-150 most recently...). I've been in an S-10 before and seen someone else drive it, been under the hood of the S-10 as well. This truck appealed to me, however.

When I got the truck, it had 148,000 miles on it. It had no rust, was virtually dentless, ran smoothly and was well-maintained, though my uncle had a blast with it and drove it a lot.

The engine got to me the most. Though Chevy did offer a 4.3 L V-6 in a similar size frame, many S-10s lacked the muscle and truckiness of the Ranger. Most S-10's came with 4 cyl's, and the ones I have looked at were badly underpowered. When you threw in the 4.3, it became a mechanical nightmare it seemed. 

So my Ranger and I went home and got acquainted. 20,000 miles later, it still runs like I just bought it. I've had little problems with it, and have taken it on a couple long hauls. It can handle a load and still has plenty of spunk on the highway. The only problem comes from a bumpy ride at higher speeds.

Overall, a tough truck. I drove the heck out of it and it still refused to break down on me. Some basic maintenance was needed in the spring, though. The power steering unit started to give out, giving my Ranger the nickname "Wookie" for the growling noises it produced as I turned the wheel.

With a lot of work (nearly two days), I had to disassemble what seemed like half of the front end to get the part out I needed out and have the new unit put together. With such a large engine comes a tremendous mechanical hassle as you try to repair it.

Despite this, this vehicle is easy to maintain, oil changes are effortless, and it is very easy and forgiving to drive. It takes a beating and keeps running.

Overall, I would recommend this vehicle for its truckiness. It is more trucklike than any similar-year light pickup. It carries more power and has a fair amount of speed about it, as well as maintaining a good, solid level of dependability.
