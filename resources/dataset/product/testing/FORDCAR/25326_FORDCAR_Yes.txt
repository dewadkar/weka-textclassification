            I am so glad I bought this car! I travel alot and needed a car which was comfy and reliable.

I got it with the Ford T-Bird. This particular model looks great, handles pretty good for an American car, and is suprisingly feul efficient on long hauls.

I have the V-6. I have had no major problems with it. I did recently change the starter, but for Ford thats a pretty normal thing. They have never made a great starter, but they do make it easy to change! I did it in about 30 minutes with two tools and only one scraped knuckle.

We have taken a few trips with it, and found its ride smooth, quiet, and relaxing. I love the visability. The stock radio is okay, just wish that the car companies would put a CD player in as standard along with a cassette. Its a great two seater, and can accomodate adults in the back. I also like the fact that there are no technical frills on it. When they break they get expensive. 

I also found that the brakes are much better than rated by others. As long as you stay ontop of changing them, you will have no problems with them.<br><br>
