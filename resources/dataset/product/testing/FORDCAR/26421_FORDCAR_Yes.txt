            I have recently traded in my Nissan Sentra for a 1996 Ford Windstar.  I could never see myself in a minivan.  But, now that I have two children, it makes more sense to have one.
I love my Windstar.  It drives so smoothly.  And, it is perfect for our upcoming trip to Kansas.  Lots more room than my Sentra ever had.  I can fit the whole family in and still have room for all of our stuff.
There are a lot of good features in the van.  It has front and rear anti lock brakes.  It also has a child safety lock on the sliding door.  Which is wonderful with my four (almost five) year old.  It has air bags on both the driver and passenger side.  Front and rear defog and wipers.  It can seat 7 people.  And, the back seat can be taken out to provide more room to carry stuff around.  There are mirrors on both visors.  It also has a tray under the passenger seat to carry cassette tapes in.
The only thing I have found that I don't like about the van is that it doesn't have power locks or windows.  It also doesn't have cruise control.  Besides that, I have no complaints.  It was a good choice for me.  If you have kids, and plan on taking long road trips, I would suggest the Windstar.  It is very comfortable.  And, very roomy.  Definitely a good buy for a family.<br><br>
