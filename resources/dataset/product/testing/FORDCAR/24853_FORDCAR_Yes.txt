            Unlike most Mustang buyers, who are teenagers, I bought a 2000 Ford Mustang because I actually liked the look and feel of the car, not just because others thought it might be cool.

First off, under initial impressions, I was not let down.  I chose to buy a Mustang coupe without the spoiler, because I wanted to maintain certain appearance of a classy vehicle while maintaining the Mustang's original sporty look.  And, personally, I must say that I think it comes across well this way.  Though it's not a luxury car, the Mustang can keep a classy look with the absence of the spoiler.  Now, that's not to say the spoiler makes the vehicle looks trashy.  It's just my personal preference.

Appearance aside, let me get to how the car handles.  To get to the point, it handles very well.  Mind you, I haven't driven in a &quot;blizzard&quot; or on icy roads yet, but I have driven through a torrential rainstorm, on very curvy roads, and on rough back-roads.  I've found in each of these conditions, and of course under normal conditions, that the Mustang handles smoothly.  Another big plus is the power.  I didn't opt for a V8 because of the insurance, but I've discovered that the V6 has more than enough &quot;gitty up&quot;.  I didn't choose the Mustang for its &quot;drag-racing&quot; potential, so a V8 engine isn't a major issue for me, though I'm sure it would provide plenty of speed for the horsepower enthusiast.

Now, I know that Ford has an &quot;urban reputation&quot; for not being too reliable, and given the experiences of people I know with Ford vehicles I tend to concur.  But also from what I've heard and learned thus far, the Mustang is the exception to this reputation and not the rule.  Like any vehicle that you want to run in peak condition, maintenance is required.  But you'll find that a little bit of care here and there, minute but consistent and regular, will be adequate.  The biggest problem I've found is actually keeping the appearance of my car looking clean, but that's simply because I chose black.  Black, when clean, is (in my opinion) the most beautiful color on the road, at the least when it pertains to the Mustang.  But again, it's not overwhelming to tiring to keep your vehicles clean.  Once more, its just a matter of doing a little bit here and there.

In conclusion, if you're looking for just some transportation that all you do with it is open and close the doors, start the engine and drive, and perhaps wash it once in a blue moon, then I don't think you want to purchase a Mustang given the money that you'd have to spend to purchase one.  Actually, it's my belief that you should take care of any vehicle you have but that's another matter altogether.  Anyway, if you're looking for a vehicle that looks good as well as performs good, then I would suggest you seriously consider the 2000 Ford Mustang.<br><br>
