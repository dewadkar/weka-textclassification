            I purchased a 2000 Ford Ranger extended cab.  I needed reliable transportation in difficult weather conditions and the Ranger has far exceeded my expectations.  I have already driven in the snow with no problems with fish-tailing or skidding.  I love the way this car handles.  It is smooth and quiet.  It is the perfect size for someone who wants a smaller truck.  The price was right, and the Ford people are there to help with any problems you may encounter, although I have no complaints as of yet.  THe sterio is awesome as well with the CD player.  <br><br>
