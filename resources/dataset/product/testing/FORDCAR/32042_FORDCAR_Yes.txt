            My husband and I bought this vehicle because our family is growing up.  We have two boys and we knew our Probe would soon be outgrown.  We have bought Ford products in the past and we knew we could count on them.  We also wanted something that was versatile.  
I like the comfortable seats of the Explorer.  I have sat in every seat of the Explorer and have found comfort in all seats.  I really like the way it drives.  It drives like a Ford what else can I say.  There is easy access to just about everything from the driver's seat.  It is very comfortable on long smooth road trips.  We drove over 2500 this past summer and we were not cramped or crowded.  We have also used the vehicle to haul many different things: camping gear, luggage,etc.
About the only thing I don't like about the Ford Explorer is driving over rough roads or uneven surfaces.  The Explorer shakes you quite a bit when riding on uneven surfaces and you do feel the bumps of rough roads.
People who should drive an Explorer are families with growing kids.  I don't recommend this for a retired couple because of the height or the shakiness on rough roads.  <br><br>
