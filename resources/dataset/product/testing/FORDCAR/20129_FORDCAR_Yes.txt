            Buying a mini-van was something I never thought I would do, until I test-drove a new 2000 Windstar.  I fell in love with everything about it. I went to the dealership planning on buying a new Explorer, and then I spotted my Emerald green Windstar......and fell in love! 

It is one of the safest mini-vans on the market and has the added feature of dual sliding doors, on the SE and SEL models.  It is so nice to come out of the store and hit the remote and have the door slide open as my son jumps in.

It handles well on the road with little to no noise.  I have the captain chairs, which are extremely comfortable.  I also went with dual heating and cooling which I don't think I could live without now.  This feature allows the rear passengers to control their own climate, without disturbing the front driver.   The kids can also listen to the radio via headphones. 

One of the hardest things for me to adjust too is not being able to see the front end of my vehicle while driving.  This takes some getting use too and is probably the only negative things I can say about the van.

I test drove every mini-van on the market, and thought that the Windstar offered the most features for my money.

On the ceiling they have the added feature of a built-in coin holder, along with a sunglass holder, and a garage door opener holder.  This makes it nice so that the kids don't know where such items are.  

They had safety in mind when designing this van.  And as always, the children safety locks are on the van.   

Positive Features:
Dual sliding doors.
7 passenger seating.
Antenna is in the window so you don't need to worry about lowering it.
Dual Heating and Cooling.
Excellent handling.
Comfortable Riding.
Rear of the van has special holders for your grocery bags to prevent  
them from sliding around.
It costs around $24.00 to fill the van with the current prices.
Steel beams in the doors.
Child safety locks.
Plenty of storage space with 7 people in the van.

Negative Features:

Can't see the front of the van while driving

This is a Great van.  I love it!!!!!!!!!
