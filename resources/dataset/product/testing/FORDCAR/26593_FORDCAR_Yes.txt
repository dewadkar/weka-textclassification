                I'm reviewing the 2002 Ford Superduty Supercab 4x4 shortbed. I purchased mine in November 2002 and currently have 7000 miles on it. Mine is white, with grey interior. A "supercab" which is also called an extended cab. I have a 5.4L Triton V8 with the basic XL trim package. It is an automatic, with air conditioning and bucket seats. I purchased the vehicle for approximately $24000, brand new, just as the 2003's were filling up the lot. I saved about $6000 off of the invoice price because it was a 2002. Pretty good deal I think, because I plan on keeping it for a bit, and I'm not as concerned about the resale value. I bought this truck, because as I scoped the lot for used trucks, I noticed the prices were high. I saw my truck sitting with 2 others of very similiar style, and all white. I chose mine because of the bigger tire package, and the bucket seats. None had power windows or locks, but I had been driving around a 1993 F-250, that didn't even have air conditioning, so anything was an upgrade at this point. The truck has been good to me so far, so I think I made the right move.

    Superduty is pretty much the F series trucks after the 150's. The 250 and up are Superduties. They come in all different styles with gas or diesel engines. If you are looking for a tough truck, then this is the truck for you. There are different packages, that will give you plenty of options to chose from. All pictures can be found on Ford's website. The Superduty has a king of the road look. It's as mean looking as it is pretty. You really feel like you own the road when you are in this truck. For the record, I am not a Ford lover that buys Ford because I hate Chevy and Dodge. I'm open minded to any vehicle to a certain extent. I just chose the Superduty because I fell in love with it for it's looks. I have done a few mods like upgrading the cheezy stereo that came with it, I put on seat covers, and bought a factory center console off of ebay brand new. I also put on black nerf bars, because it was tough for my kids to get in the truck. When this truck is clean, it looks like a million bucks.

    As far as the engine goes, there is just so many different things you can do based on what you need. Some people like to plow or really work there truck, so they may want to get the V10 or the Power Stroke Diesel. I have the Triton V8 5.4L. The gears also make a big difference too. I have the stock gears. 3.73's I believe. I'm not a gear head, but I know that mine are perfect for me. The truck cruises easily at 80mph, but it gets better gas mileage at or around 65. It also handles the bumps like they are pebbles. I like the power it has, but I have been in stronger trucks. I attribute this to the fact that I have the most basic engine and gears in the Superduty class. I'm sure if I had the other engines or gears, it would be more powerful, but I just do not need it. It easily gets out of its own way, and it's not too bad for a big truck as far as gas mileage is concerned. I estimate that I get about 16 miles per gallon. I have seen it getting 12 or so, but that was just my lead foot. I think it could get 18, but I never had the patience to do a consistent 65. It really depends on the way you drive it, and as it has broken in, it has been doing ok for me.

    I'm glad I bought this truck. I feel like a got what I wanted for what it cost. I would have loved to leave the dealership with a fully loaded one, but that may have to wait till the next time. This truck has performed great for me. It drives great in the snow. It can hang with the speeders on the freeway, and it also gets you around in traffic great too. Most drivers seem to let you go when you are in a big truck, because they are afraid you will go Bigfoot on them. I have fit 3 kids in the back seat with no problem. It's pretty big back there, and if I pull the seats up they have plenty of legroom. Pull the seats up... Yeah right...    I don't think so. There's plenty of room back there, just as long as I'm not back there. The truck has been great so far, and the 21 dollar oil changes at my dealer are great too. 7000 miles, with nothing to report but good news.
