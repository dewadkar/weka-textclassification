            In 1999 Ford came out with their latest body style mustang.  They improved the overall appearance of the car as well as the power underneath the hood.

Ford did a great job on the newest incarnation of an already classic American musclecar.  The newest Mustang sports a few more boxy edges than it's predecessor as well as flared fenders and a new spoiler.

They improved the popular base 3.8 V6 Mustang from 150 HP in 1998 to 190 HP in '99.  This much improved car actually gives it some get up and go.  The standard 5-spd manual is a bit of a reach when going for some gears, but overall a good fit.  The optional automatic suffers some parasitic loss transferring the power to the rear wheels.

Overall this is a great car with a meaner look and a quality engine underneath it's hood.
