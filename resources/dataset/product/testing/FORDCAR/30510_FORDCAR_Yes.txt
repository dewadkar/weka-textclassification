            I purchased my new 99 F-350 4x4 in Sept. 99.  I chose the Extended Cab, PS Diesel, and auto transmission.

Broken out by category:

Power - The power stroke engine (Made by International) seems to put out some real power from 30-50 MPH.  Low end power is a little lacking.  

Comfort - This truck is more comfortable than some passenger cars.  The front seats are very good size.  Controls are accessible.  6-8 hours trips don't wear you out in this baby!  Engine noise is there, but only under load.

Safety - I am not overly excited about the anti-lock brakes.  I have had control issues more than once due to the anti-locks detecting a skid and releasing.  Unfortunately, it was on dry payment with cars ahead.  The truck reacts well to sudden steering changes.  

Heat/Air - The heater and air both work good.  The fan motor seems slightly under powered.  The high setting leaves a little to be desired if you are expecting hurricane winds to come out of the vents.

Fuel Economy - Less than sticker.  I average 13-14 City or Hwy with nothing in tow.  This is less that I would expect (and less than Ford tells you to expect.)

Maintenance - Brakes are rotors are wearing way to earlier.  Shop fixed at no charge.  Watch out for that one!
