            I bought my '90 Ford Festiva used in December of 1999, the day after someone rear-ended my Honda Del Sol convertible and totaled it. I am a sports car fan, before the Del Sol I owned a Camaro RS, and I intended to keep the Festiva only until I was able to finance a new sports car. 

I quickly fell in love with the goofy looking little Festiva. The acceleration is much better than I expected. I'm used to a sport suspension, and so I like the Festiva's firm suspension. The handling is pretty decent, even in Minnesota blizzards, but I sometimes get buffeted by strong winds. 

The Festiva had 78,000 miles on it when I bought it and now has 92,000. The car starts very well in extremely cold weather and runs smoothly. I perform the recommended maintenance religiously, but I have still had a couple of repairs. I replaced the alternator and the exhaust pipe that goes from the manifold to the catalytic converter. The parts for this car are expensive and difficult to obtain from most parts shops and outrageously expensive from the dealer. I've bought all my parts from the local junkyard.

The gas mileage for this car is incredible. I get between 30 and 35 miles to the gallon. (The Festiva's gas tank holds 38 liters, a bit over 10 gallons, so I get at least 300 miles to a tank of gas.) I feel proud to be doing my part to reduce emissions and save the environment.

The interior of the car is much more roomy than you'd expect, with ample headroom for adults, even my 6' tall husband. Folding the backseat down adds to the cargo space considerably. The knobs are all easy to reach and use.

Overall, I'm very pleased with my Festiva, especially since the original price I paid was less than I would have spent on a rental car after the accident. If the Festiva was still in production, I'd buy another one for safe winter driving, plus a fast convertible for sunny summer days.<br><br>
