            There were two main reasons why I purchased this vehicle and why I will purchase it again.  The first reason was price.  This car was truly in my price range and I got a great deal from the dealer I purchased it from.  My car payments were right were I needed them to be at the time, yet I had just purchased very dependable transportation and transportation that leads me to my second point on purchasing this vehicle.  Very good gas mileage.  This was extremely important because I drive 70 miles round trip daily to and from work.  When I purchased the Escort gas prices were just about where they are now, approximately $1.25 a gallon.  This vehicle has averaged approximately 37 miles to the gallon, so it is costing me less than $2.50 a day for gas.  When I drive my other vehicle it costs me twice as much in gas.

As gas prices continue to go up, I would strongly recommend that people look at this vehicle for a very dependable and economical means of transportation.<br><br>
