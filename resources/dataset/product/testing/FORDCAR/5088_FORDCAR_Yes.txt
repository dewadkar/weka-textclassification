            Upon retiring to Arizona, and after driving bare bones vehicles forever, I finally was able to buy (used) my 1997 4 door Ford Taurus GL.  I love it.  The only drawback I can find is that it uses a little more gas than I would like.  That might have to do with the 6 cyl. engine, which was a must for me.  I spent so many years being left in the dust that I love to finally be able to &quot;kick butt&quot; and pass other vehicles when I please and, of course, when it is safe to do so.  It is reliable, has required very little maintenance or repairs, and is roomy and comfortable.  How do you like my first review?
