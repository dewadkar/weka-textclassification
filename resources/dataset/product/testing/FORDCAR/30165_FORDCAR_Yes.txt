            I got my 1991 Ford Festiva when I was 17.  It was my first car, and I bought it for $2500 in good condition.  I would fill up the tank every 2 weeks or so.  It was very easy to handle, especially when parking, and could hit 80 mph without trouble.  Mine was the 4th Festiva in the family.  My parents own 2, and my sister owns 1 (she still drives it, by the way).  The Festiva is tiny from the outside, but really very roomy on the inside.  My father, who is 6 foot 5 inches tall, can fit in his comfortably.  The back seat is smaller, but still suitable for 2 adults.  The maintenance costs for the Festiva are almost non-existent.  The tires are very cheap (Pirrelli's for $25 each).  I no longer have my Festiva, but I would love to own one again.  I sold mine after having the engine switched with another Festiva with a better body (and muffler, and radio, and heater, etc.).  It never ran quite the same, but it still ran.  Due to a commute that I had, I sold it to buy something more reliable.  It's a shame that Ford felt the need to discontinue them after 1993.<br><br>
