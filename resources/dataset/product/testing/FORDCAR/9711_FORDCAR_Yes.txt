            I bought my 92'Ford Probe because of how sporty and fast it was. I love how all I need to do is put gas in it and change the oil. The Ford Probe is a fun and fast car it hugs the road at all times even going up the Mountians. Anyone who is looking for something Sporty but don't want to spend that much at least test drive one, I have put 150,000 miles on mine and she still runs like new.<br><br>
