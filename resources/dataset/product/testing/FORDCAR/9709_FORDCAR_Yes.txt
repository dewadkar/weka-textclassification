            The ford probe series I believe has been a successful one even the passenger vehicle has been discontinued since 1997. The 1997 Ford Probe was created in 3 versions: The Probe LX or base model, the Probe GT and a special edition for 1997, The GTS. Though the GT and GTS were equipped with the same engine, a 2.5 litter v6 engine, the GTS came standard with five spoke chrome wheels and premium sound. The only visual difference between the two models is the rear center reflector situated between the two tail lamps. On the GT model, it is inscribed GT. As for the GTS model, the center reflector has no inscription. 

The performance of this vehicle is outstanding for its class. No car, of my knowledge, has been equipped with a 2.5 litter v6 engine capable of 164hp and 160lbs of torque, other then its sister, the Mazda MX-6 LS. Though the base model only has 118hp and 127lbs of torque, it still is formidable against other vehicles of the same class. 

When it comes to styling, this vehicle is unique. Beautiful curves, pop-up lights and outstanding design make this vehicle stand out in a crowd. One detail that I find impressive on this vehicle is the door latches. Instead of the conventional latches situated on the front of the door and you must lift up to open the door. Ford has opted for a handle that is integrated on the edge the door, which gives the car an aerodynamic look. 

The inside of the vehicle is very spacious for one driver and passenger. Like most two door sports vehicles, rear passengers, even with comfortable seating, seemed to be "squished" in the back. On certain models, the driver&#146s seat has an electrical control which can adjust either your back or can squeeze in the seat from the sides so you don't move in the seat when taking curves at high speeds. 

The handling on this vehicle is incredible, both on the base and GT (GTS) models. The GT model comes equipped with standard 16 inch wheels with 225/50/16 wheels. These tires are very wide compared to other cars and give you better traction on the road. Although, wider tires often mean a rougher ride, the Probe's suspension compensates slightly for this phenomenon. 

On a downside, for the GT model, because of its v6 engine, fuel consumption is a little high compared to other vehicles. Also, because of its discontinuation and of its foreign parts (made by Mazda), repairs can often be costly.
