            We just love our '98 Contour! When we were expecting we were looking for a quality car at an affordable price. This car definately got our attention. We bought at the end of the year when the new models came out to save money . Then after being quoted a price of over $16,000 I wheeled and dealed to get this car for under $14,000.

The car itself had all the amenities including antilock brakes, A/C, CD Player, Air bags etc. It has a HUGE trunk, roomy back seat, w/ shoulder strap seat belts for back seat passengers. We get great gas mileage too!

When compared w/ the Taurus we HAD planned to buy, the only &quot;real&quot; differences we could find was a little more room, and paying $4,500 more. 
For anyone looking for a family car, or even someone that wanted a car for traveling long distances to work, this is it!<br><br>
