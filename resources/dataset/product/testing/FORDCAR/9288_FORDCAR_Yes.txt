            I am by no means a car expert --  just a Los Angeles driver with three teenagers who needs a dependable and not too gas-hungry car to battle traffic in.

I shopped at the Toyota lot first (looked at and drove the Camry and the Corrola sp?) but I chose my 1999 Ford Contour for its responsiveness (the gas pedal AND the steering.)  My daughter drives a 2000 Mustang and the turning ratio and handling are nearly identical in our cars.

I spent under $18,000 and got everything I felt were non-negotiables - power doorlocks, power windows, etc., a cd player, great sound (for a factory system, anyway), tinted windows and a sleek, sporty looking exterior.  The spoiler on the back made the Contour a hit with my teens.  The gas mileage...could be better, but I get around 20mpg.

The seats are horrible, by the way.  I bought a custom seat cushion to compensate for the discomfort - and that made it okay.

THERE IS ONLY ONE REAL PROBLEM....

And for me, its a big one.

I play my radio relatively loud, and am likely to be seen singing (you know those crazy people at the light next to you who don't seem to care that they look like loons?  That's me.  Well, it took about a week for me to realize that when the radio is not on, the road noise is irritatingly loud.  Not deafening, but noticeable enough to get on my nerves.  

Would I buy another one?  If they could make the ride quieter - DEFINITELY... But, if not, I think I might have to consider a used luxury car instead - perhaps a BMW or a Mercedes Benz.  <br><br>
