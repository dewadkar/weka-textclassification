            We owned a 1992 Ford Aerostar, which we purchased used.  Didn't realize until out shopping for a &quot;possible&quot; new car that they had discontinued making this model.  After searching on the web and talking to friends that own Windstars, not to mention walking into a deal on one, we chose the Windstar.  I was convinced that I was not going to like this vehicle, I loved my Aerostar, about a week after purchasing our Windstar (1998 model), I was indeed in love again.  Our family is getting older and kids are getting ready to move out.  I cannot honestly see myself driving any other type of vehicle, even when its just one child and us.  Ours has traction control, which I've never had before, but had to use one or two days after initial purchase, worked great on a solid sheet of ice.
If you have a young family this vehicle would be ideal, plenty of room for car seats, toys, etc.  And plenty of room for the kids &quot;not&quot; to touch each other.  Travel is made comfortable by the reclining middle seat (we have 2 bench seats instead of captain's chairs in this one).  Plus with a luggage rack on top, mounting a car top carrier is very easy.<br><br>
