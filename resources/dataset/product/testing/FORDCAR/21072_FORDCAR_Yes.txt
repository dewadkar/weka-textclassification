            This is my second minivan.I owned an Aerostar before this one.I like the new Windstar because it is roomy and easy to drive.The added door on the driver's side is especially nice. Now you don't have to wait for others to get in.
One added feature is the auto lock doors.When you put the vehicle in gear the doors automatically lock,and the rear doors can not be opened by small children.The added door also makes it easier to get my granddaughter in out of her car seat.
I would recommend this vehicle to anyone with small children in booster or car seats. There is also a mirror in front that lets you view the back seat so that you don't have to look around.
I was recently struck in the leg by a small pickup truck. I am even more grateful for my Windstar now than before. My right leg is in an immobile brace from 6inches above my knee to my ankle. If we had a smaller vehicle I would have a very difficult time getting in and out.The Windstar is just the right height to keep me from having to bend to get in, and I don't have to pull myself up in order to get out. I still have room in the front to extend my leg comfortably,even with the brace.<br><br>
