            I got my Taurus from my brother about ten months ago and it's been in the shop about five times, needing major repairs each time.  One mechanic told me I shouldn't waste any more money fixing it because there are so many problems it's not worth it.  I was just flabbergasted because my brother had had it for three years and said it was great--that he hadn't had any problems except that maybe it ate up gas a little too quickly for his likes.  Boy was that an understatement.  

I have spent three hundred dollars on its brakes, 550 for new engine mounts, $25 dollars a week for gas, and my mother who previously serviced it took it in about two times before me i believe.  The plastic insides of the car aren't quality either.  The fabric panel on the passenger side door is pulling away from its frame and I can only open the passenger door from the inside--a major annoyance.  

The only thing I can vouch well for on this car is its pick up.  I had previously owned a very reliable Toyota Corolla that I gave to my father that was only a V4.  I can breath easier with my Taurus's V6 when I'm getting on the freeway--it makes me feel a lot safer in that regard.  

But when it clunks into gear in the morning I feel like it's on the verge of falling apart completely--this does not make me feel safe.  Bottom line--stick with Toyotas.  They are the best vehicles out there.<br><br>
