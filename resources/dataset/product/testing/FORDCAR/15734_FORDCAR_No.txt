            I bought the 95 Ford Windstar due to our 2 year old daughter and our future children. My husband and I previously owned a Dodge Caravan we loved. We found the Windstar for a great price $8000. with 89,000 miles
Lots of miles but looked in good condition.  The van was great for the first 2 months then it got crazy. First trouble with the air which turned out to be the computer $500. Then it started overheating.  We checked the thermostat no problem.  On the way back from the beach we blew the head gaskets $1200. And now the transmission is acting iffy.  And at this point we have so much money invested in the car we can't sell so we are stuck driving it until it dies. We had read Consumer Reports before we bought the van and it checked out. Unfortunately we didn't wait long enough because now it's coming out that it's a lemon. So buyer beware!!<br><br>
