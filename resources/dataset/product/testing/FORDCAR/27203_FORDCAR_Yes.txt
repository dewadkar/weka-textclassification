            Spacious interior, even for back seat passengers. Offers ample leg room for back seat guests as well as seat belts which include the shoulder harness, not just the old lap belts! You can fit three passengers comfortably in the back seat too.

The six way adjustable driver's seat is a blessing to short people, like myself, because now I can raise the seat to a height I feel comfortable at and to one which allows me to better see the road. My husband can lower the seat for taller people, like himself. What a great idea!

Traveling with children? Back doors have child safety locks and the windows can be switched so that only the driver controls them! That sure cuts down on various items being tossed out of the windows while in transit!

Have a grocery store that offers parcel pick up and don't want to get out in the rain to open the trunk? Just touch the trunk release button inside! Can't remember where you parked your new car at the mall? A simply touch on the Panic Button on the remote sets your horn honking to get your attention and guide you to it! One more touch of the button and the horn stops. The Key Less door entry makes this car great when heading for it with your arms filled with parcels. You can pop open the trunk and unlock the doors before you ever arrive at it!

And no more worries about kids playing around and accidentally shutting themselves in the trunk either, thanks to a glow in the dark trunk release handle inside the trunk itself! Nice added safety feature! And, while we are on the subject of the trunk, it's huge!! Plus the back seats fold down for extra carrying space as well!

The warranty and emergency road care package that comes with it are one of the best packages we have seen and, believe us, we checked out a LOT of cars on-line before we even thought about buying this one.

One last note - unlike the hatchback (which some people had problems with) - we found NO blind spots while driving our new "baby" and the rear window was easy to see out of !

------------ UPDATE MAY 28, 2001 -------------------------------------

Well we drove her to San Antonio and back over Memorial Day Weekend and here's our latest review on her:

Gas Mileage: Started the trip counter when we started our trip on Friday morning (the 25th). Arrived San Antonio later that morning - after driving 285 miles - on about 9 gallons of gas!!! Averaged about 32 miles per gallon. Awesome gas mileage to me - hubby said it was what Ford had advertised for this vehicle:)

Comfort: Passenger's seat very comfortable. Good leg room. Driver's side seat however left something to be desired. You can drive about 3 hours comfortably - after that, seat is much less than comfy. Lower back pain attributed to seat. 

Handling: Handling is wonderful! Even driving in San Antonio with the local crazy drivers was bearable thanks to her great maneuverability! I personally LOVED the cruise control feature, by the way!:)

Over All: While we highly recommend this car for short trips and around town - it's not exactly the car you'd want to make a long drive in - unless you did a lot of rest stops for stretching purposes or brought another driver or two to switch off with.
