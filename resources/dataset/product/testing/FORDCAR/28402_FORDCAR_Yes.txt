            this is my second taurus i totaled my other taurus which was a '97 considering the physics of the accident (distance velocity impact etc..)i was very very satisfied with the taurus's performance other than frazzled nerves my son and i walked away okay to be honest the 2 main reasons i bought another taurus were safety and financial i have first hand knoweledge of the safety features but from an economic stand point i couldn't afford not to buy another ford between the rebate and employer discount (i work for ge)i bought a nicely equipped 2002 se for @17000 which is invoice for a taurus lx no one else offered that kind of package finances aside the car is really designed for families which i like i have a 3 yr old which means i have a toddler seat to haul in and out i love the fact that when i put the seat in the back the space doesn't disappear while i gripe about driving a 4 door sedan i love the space i hate riding in my friends' cars (which is why i always drive)because they drive cute sports or mid sized cars that have absolutely so space whatsoever i recently drove my new taurus to atlanta and other than the usual blah of traveling in the car for 8 hours the passenger (who's pregnant)myself and my 3 yr old were comfortable my 18 yr old sister drove my old taurus with 4 other friends to daytona beach and was impressed with the car overall but particularly with the cabin space and the trunk (luggage for 5 girls taurus has a BIG trunk) my only complaints are the mileage and quality of the stereo i commute @50 mi daily and i fill up 2/wk my other taurus had so so mileage also and the stereo (this must be my age speaking) quality is poor i crank it all the way up and i don't go deaf if ford would upgrade those two things i'd be a happy camper i don't consider myself a ford devotee but i will sing the taurus's praises to anyone willing to listen when i'm ready to buy another car in a few years i'm going to keep taurus on my list and if no one else offers the discounts that ford does i'll probably wind up in another taurus i recommend a taurus to anyone with kids or anyone who just likes a roomy cabin at an affordable price
