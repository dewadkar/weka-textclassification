            We are coming to the end of our lease and it's time to asses the last 3 years with our EB 98 Expedition. I have to admit to being annoyed at all the snide remarks in the press about SUV drivers. Some of us actually need to carry 7 people (my wife and I have 5 kids between us) and she is also a Realtor so has to take clients to many different kinds of properties and they often like to bring their kids too. Would I prefer that it got 25 mpg instead of 12-15? Well, yes of course but none do yet.

The ride is surprisingly good in a straight line and makes for very relaxed touring. I imagine that the high profile Goodyear Wrangler tires have a lot to do with that. However the thought of having to make a serious avoidance manouver at 70 mph is scary and I'm sure could be disasterous when all of that soft suspension travel and the soft tire sidewalls are used up and rebounds to send the vehicle who knows where. The front seats are quite comfortable but the headrests are so far behind your head I question what good they are other than looking good. Power around town is very good (5000') but I hear that these earlier Expeditions are a bit sluggish for towing at higher altitudes. I prefer how this rides to the Suburban and the Mach 460 stereo is wonderful.

The transmission is really very good with 4 different settings. 2x4 for normal driving, Automatic 4wd for those varying conditions where the roads are snowy/icy/wet, 4x4 and Low range 4x4. The Auto 4x4 seemed to work well but is a little clunky engaging and I don't think it works while coasting and slowing so you may be surprised coming up to an intersection. The ABS works very well but again seems to disengage itself at low speeds so embarrasing sliding stops at lights are still possible. Overall we were always impressed with how well it worked. The low 4x4 was great for our 'offroading' which was, unfortunately, restricted to some areas of the Oregon Trail where we  definitely tested the traction and the diminished clearance under the running boards.

Our Expedition has been very reliable (surprisingly so) and has only been in for scheduled maintenance. Our Dealer-Heritage Ford in Loveland Colorado- has been exceptional with a door to door courtesy car available and excellent service.  What a nice change!!  

So what shall we do at the end of the lease? With gas prices sky high and maybe higher gas mileage is a priority. 2 kids have moved out so we only 'need' a 5 seater. The Acura MDX looks very good with higher gas mileage so that is an option. If we can negotiate a really good deal to purchase the EB I think that would be our number 1 choice.....stay tuned for the update.........................
