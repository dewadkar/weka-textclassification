            This was the first car I owned.  I sold it with 144,000 miles.  It still had the original engine and transmission.  The front seats were comfortable, but I felt bad for whoever was in the back seats.  The trunk was spacious and the rear seats fold down to give it even more room.  Besides basic maintenance(belts,breaks,oil)  The only problem was that I dropped out my exhaust system.  It was rusted from the CAT back.  The only suggestion that I could make is, avoid this car in the automatic trans.  I owned a 96' GT automatic.  I had so many problems with it.
