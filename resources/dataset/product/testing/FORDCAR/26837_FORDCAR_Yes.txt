            The Ford Expedition comes in four models XLT 2WD &amp; 4WD, Eddie Bauer 2WD &amp; 4WD. Standard Features include integrated antenna and power adjustable pedals. It also has a new reverse system that locates objects  behind the vehicles path and alerts the driver with an increasing series of beeps the closer the vehicle approaches an object. The Expeditions Eddie Bauer editions come with a sharp two tone paint job. Add illuminated running boards for an even sharper look. I brought my Expedition because I wanted an SUV. I have a thing for looks so I went with the best looking SUV on the market. When driving an Expedition you have to take a few extra step when changing lanes. There are a few blind spots. With 215 horses under the hood the Expedition packs a mighty punch.   <br><br>
