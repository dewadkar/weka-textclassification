            This vehicle does more than off road - when in 4 wheel drive, it handles snow well!  Since I was moving to the &quot;SALT BELT&quot; from sunny So Cal, I needed something that would help me make it through deep snow. The car is roomy and the SOHC Engine is strong. The sound system is very nice, as well!

The car is great, except for one major thing - the windshield wipers like to turn on by themselves - ANNOYING!!! 

When I am driving this vehicle, I feel like I am driving a Harley - I can feel the power of my Explorer!

I would not recommend this car for people who don't off road. Additionally, the car is not suited to urban dwellers.  If you live in the middle of nothing, like me, you need something that can make it up a hill that is covered in 2 ft. of snow!<br><br>
