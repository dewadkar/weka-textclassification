               <b>S</b>ince 1964 the Ford Mustang has offered amazing performance for its owners, despite some power issues in late 70s and all early 1980s models, the Ford Mustang prevailed, and brought performance back to speed enthusiasts with the 5.0 models in the mid 1980s. For the 1998 model year a 4.6 liter DOHC unit lies under the hood of the Cobra. A weaker SOHC 4.6 lies under the hood of the 1998 GT with an adequate 225 horsepower(260 for 1999  models), but the 1998 SVT ( SVT= special vehicles team) Cobra boasts 305 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque.

<b>Note:</b> For 2003 the Mustang Cobra will comes with a  supercharged 4.6 pumping out a meaty 390 HP!


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>
     
<b>When you start up this DOHC engine</b> you know you are in a car made for performance. The exhaust note is husky, and during hard acceleration can be heard from miles around. The quad cam V8 loves to rev and begs you to drive it harder. Like the Pontiac Trans AM and Camaro Z28 offered from GM, the Cobra can reach 60 MPH in less than 6 seconds (according to specs). 
With other cars on the market boasting even more power, the 1998 Cobra could have done with some more horses, but as it is, the Cobra does just fine playing its role as a speed demon. Hills, as expected, are not a problem. Any incline is small prey for this snake. 
Quad shocks help the stock rear tires to hook up straight away. The 5-speed is smooth, not quite as smooth or accommodating as GM's 6-speed manual, but it's a good match for this engine. A 6-speed would have been welcomed for the Cobra, but I'm not complaining. The 1998 Cobra handles very well, and seemed to handle much better than the regular GT trim lines. Goodyear GS-C high performance tires, and large 17" wheels provide excellent grip through the corners; the live axle can result in oversteer however. The ride is smooth, the softer <b>suspension</b> tends to let the Cobra ride smoothly on rough surfaces. 
Fuel economy is fair, expect to get around 26 MPG on the freeway in the 1998 Mustang Cobra.  

   The 1998 Mustang Cobra is based on the 179-1993 Mustang, but with 40% more chassis rigidity. Known as the Fox Platform, it has Macpherson struts at the front and a live rear axle. Compared to the chassis used on the previous generation cars, the 1998 Mustang has greater stiffening in the body, and a standard strut lower brace. A pair of horizontally-mounted rear shock absorbers helps reduce 'wheel hop' under hard acceleration, but does not have a torque arm running alongside the driveshaft.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

  The <b>interior</b> of the 1998 Mustang Cobra is well thought out, Ford seemed to have used their heads this time with the quality of the Mustang's interior. Compared to a family sedan the Mustang Cobra has a very cramped interior, but this is a small 2 door sports coupe so room is adequate for the driver and front passenger, however very cramped for the rear seat passengers. Head room is the biggest issue here, even at 5'6" my head would hit the rear hatch window. The Mustang Cobra has very comfortable power leather seats and good lumbar adjustments. The Mustang Cobra has good outward visibility in all directions, perhaps lacking a bit in the rear, but offers much more rear visibility than cars like the Camaro and Firebird. 
Ergonomics are almost perfect. The HVAC controls are logically placed, along with the rest of the offered amenities which are are plentiful, especially for an American sports coupe. My Cobra's interior was dressed in black, the leather was adequate in quality, but felt more plasticy than many imported sports coupes. One thing the Americans have a hard time accomplishing in a economical sports car is providing good leather, the Cobra is an example of that. The instrument cluster is filled with useful, sporty, white instrumentation. The stock stereo system is very loud and provides tons of base! It's not the most clear sounding system out there, however if you want loud, the Cobra has got it, standard.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

 The <b>exterior</b> is very sexy, especially when dressed in black. Mine, unfortunately, was dressed in canary yellow, but this doesn't take too much away from this combination of sleek, sexy, and sporty styling. Cobra's have high intensity headlights, and larger air slots in the hood, these features distinguish them from the lesser Mustangs such as the V6 powered trims and the GT. Another feature is a little Cobra logo on the sides of the car. The dual stainless steel exhaust pipes, and the fog lamps really add to this sporty theme. 

  <b>Price:</b> A Cobra in 1998 ran for close to $27,000. This, only second to the GM line-up of muscle cars, was the fastest production car you could buy under $30,000. Today a 1998 Cobra can be bought for near, or around $18,000. For 1999 the Cobra received 15 extra horsepower, and a new body style, there were many recalls on this model due to horse power issues, some engines in the Cobra were putting out as little as 260 horsepower at the flywheel. Ford was claiming a 320 peak horsepower. Ford did correct this problem but as a warning, if you choose to buy a '99, make sure the recall was done on your car. Back to the '98 model year,  I have hear do no major problems, 
   
Mustangs rate very well in the reliability department. Check <b>Consumer Reports. Org</b> for more info. I'm actually thinking about buying a lesser 1999 Mustang GT, I'll have to wait and see.

<i>Conclusion:</i>

The 1998 Mustang Cobra offers extreme bang for your buck in the used sports coupe market. Despite other cars such as the Camaro Z28 boasting quicker 0-60 times, the Cobra seems to offer a better ride, superior refinement, and a more desirable car overall.
