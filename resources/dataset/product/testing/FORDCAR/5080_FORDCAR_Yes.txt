            I think I'll just skip the part about the good ride, the roominess, the features, the easy accessibility in the engine compartment and just get to the part about how my Taurus saved me.

I was toughing it out with a 1987 Reliant K car when I bought the car in October of 1997.  I still drove the beast as the Taurus sat in the garage, especially in the winter.  The part that concerned me more than the reliability, was the small size of the car and the heavy flow of traffic on the busy freeways I must travel to work.  I don't think those cars can take much of a hit.

I finally got rid of the old jalopy in the summer of 1999.  The following month, I was involved in a collision with a '99 Dodge Ram.  The driver was on a cell-phone as he entered the intersection against a red light.  I hit the space between the cab and the box, wedging the car underneath.  I was going approximately 40 mph.  

After I made sure I was all right, I got out.  I surveyed the damage.  Although the car was totalled (and not by much, let me tell you), the car did what it was supposed to. The engine compartment, and the front frame pieces absorbed most of the impact.   Except for a little ringing of the ears from airbags, and a little upperbody stiffness, I was fine.  Except for a cut on my arm.  

When the airbags inflated, the passenger side panel cover (which is heavier than you might think) deployed so hard, it broke the windshield.  Little glass fragments were scattered around the car.  To me, this is a major design flaw.  While I'm glad that the airbag functioned properly, it caused a secondary injury which just shouldn't have happened.  Thankfully, the car wasn't still in motion, or I would never have been able to see.

This passenger airbag panel design is on all 96-99 models.  It probably could be fixed by removing the metal on the underside which would reduce the the weight of the panel and the amount of force necessary for the panel to open.
