            About a month and a half ago, someone ran into my beat up 86 Ford Escort and totaled it!!  At first I saw it as a bad thing because I needed to find something new to drive, which would mean car payments!!!  

After putting the keys in the ignition and driving off the lot I knew that it was an good thing that my car had been totaled out!!  This car is so neat!  The style reminds me of a jetta (just not the price tag attached to it!)  

The ride is extremely smooth and it is just an all around comfortable car to be in.  The blinkers and wipers are positioned so that they are easy to access.  As is the a/c and radio!  

After purchasing this vehicle I took it on an eight hour road trip, each way.  Not once did my tushie ache or back hurt, the ride was comfortable and excellent.  Currently I'm getting around 27 to 30 miles a gallon.  

This car is excellent for anyone really except for a family.  There is plenty of leg room and head room and four people can comfortably ride in my sedan!

Oh and by the way, the other day I received a care package from Ford!  They sent me a nice Casio Sports Watch because of my purchase!!  I thought that was alright...<br><br>
