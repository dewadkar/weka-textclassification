            Yes, I did it.  I got rid of a Chevy and picked up a Ford.  I had a Chevy Cavalier for two years.  In the end, it gave me more problems than I could afford so I thought I'd take a different route and try a Ford.

I ended up with a metallic green 1998 Ford Contour.  Of course, I got harassed by a lot of people claiming that Fords were awful cars and that I'd have to have it &quot;fixed or repaired daily.&quot;  I have had quite the opposite experience with it.  

I absolutely love my Ford!  It's a very pretty car inside and out.  It has a fairly nice ride for a car of it's year.  The interior is not leather, so that's a big plus too.  It's furnished with automatic windows and locks.  It has air conditioning and heat that actually work, and it doesn't take all that long to kick in.  It has duel airbags, and that's a plus because it helps the insurance to go down, and it keeps me safe in the event of a severe accident.  It does very well on gas, and it also takes long trips very well.  I take it four hours every weekend and I'm yet to have a problem with it.

As far as price goes, it is a somewhat costly car to buy.  I got lucky and got somewhat of a deal because I traded my other car in from the dealer I bought it from to start with.  I still ended up with a five year loan at 200.00 a month to finish paying off the Chevy and to get the Ford.

It has very comfortable seats, and it's just fine for long trips.  I've only had it to the shop once since I bought it, and it was for a minor repair.  It isn't exactly the quietest car all the time.  When you go to speed up it almost reminds you of a race car getting ready to take off.  It's not THAT loud, but it does annoy me a little bit because I prefer a very quiet running car.  Another thing about it is the headlights are very bright.  I have a lot of people that are constantly flashing their high beams at me when I don't have them on.

So, overall, I love my car.  I think it would be an especially great car for a family because the four doors make it very convenient for getting kids in and out.<br><br>
