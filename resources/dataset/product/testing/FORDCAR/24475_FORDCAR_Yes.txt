            I have a 91 Escort Gt. I bought it because i liked the body style. After many years and miles I needed to get a new car. I debated on getting another Escort, but chose instead a 2002 Ford Focus. The Ford Focus was a replacement too for the Escort which was supposedly going to be discontinued.  Needless to say SweetPea my 2002 Ford Focus was hit by another motorist(who was speeding and had no insurance). So while my own car is being repaired, i've had the opportunity to drive a Escort ZX2. I have to be honest with you. The body style is nice and sporty. The controls are like my 91 Escort GT. But I must admit I like my Ford Focus better. It seems roomier inside, and  the trunk is larger than in the Escort. The visibility in the Escort ZX2 is the same as in my Escort but the visibility in SweetPea my 2002 Ford Focus is better. I like Fords. What I look for is body style,comfort,visibility, and how the vehicle controls are placed in the dashboard. Front wheel drive is nice. Automatic transmission, and controls within arms reach. Fords are good cars, when it comes to the engine etc. i must admit i'm clueless. I've always gone for the body style, price range, and how comfortable a vehicle is too drive, and comfort for passengers. My chance to drive a ZX2 has been nice, but even my passengers have told me they can't wait until I get SweetPea back. Hopefully today I'll be able to have my own car back in my possession.
