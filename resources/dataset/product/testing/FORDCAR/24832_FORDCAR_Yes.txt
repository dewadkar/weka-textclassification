            At last, the power has been returned to the 2000 Mustang. The body screams 'Look, I'm tough !'And trust me, the engine is there to back it up. The GT comes with a 8 cylinder 4.6 (260hp @ 5250rpm) which will get 17 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on highway, where the 6 cylinder 3.8 (190hp @ 5250rpm) will get 20 mpg in town and 29 out on the open road. Power with economy is what we all have wanted for years.
Not since the early 70s has there been anything close to a muscle car, until now. With the stylish looks and the power under the hood, this is one car that everyone will love to drive. It steers very good at most speeds and wind-noise is minimal. Any color you choose will be an eye-catcher!
The only holdback I see with this car is the small trunk opening. The convertible cargo space is even a bit smaller.
The Mustang will seat 4 comfortably and can be equipped with all the extras. Load it up! If you are going to spend $16,000, why not get what you really want for a few thousand more?<br><br>
