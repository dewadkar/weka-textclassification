            When I bought my Ford Escort in 1997, I did so completely on impulse.  I needed a car, I saw the car, and I bought it.  Am I glad that I did.  Eighty thousand miles and two major rear-end collisions later, I am happy to report that my Escort is still an incredibly reliable car.  

The car came equipped with every possible option, and every one of them still works fine.  The stereo system is excellent for a car in this class.  The climate control remains as effective as ever.  The instrument panel is clear and easy to use, and seating is very comfortable albeit cramped in the back seat.

Since I've owned the car, I've replaced rear shocks and struts, rotors, and that's about it.  This is pretty normal for a car with a few miles on the odometer.  I've also bought tires, changed oil, brakes, etc, but that's not news.

Would I buy another Escort?  No.  I've gotten older and spoiled, and I like creature comforts too much now.  Would I recommend the Escort?  In spite of the fact that the Starbucks Coffee Cup spills over all too often, the answer is an emphatic YES!  The 1997 Escort is a great car and a great value for the money.
