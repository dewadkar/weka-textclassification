I have always been partial to Ford Products.  After having Mercury Cougars for 14 years it was time for a new vehicle.  In 1999 the Cougar became a small car.  I decided to wing it and go with the SUV.  This was the best decision in a vehicle I have ever made.  I will never own anything but an Explorer from now on.

I call it my truck.  It is just awesome.  I can shop all day and have room for everything.  It drives like a truck so if you want a smooth ride this probably isn't for you.  But if you can deal with a few bumps you can have a luxury vehicle on the inside.  Fully loaded it is just like being in a Lincoln or Cadillac.  But it is fun.  You don't have to go around those puddles anymore.

It is a very comfortable vehicle as compared to a car because you sit up higher and your legs are positioned more like being in a chair than sitting on the floor which is the case in many sport vehicles.

Taking it on a trip is a new experience.  You will have room for everything.  You can back just about everything but the kitchen sink in and still have room.  And if you do fill it up, you still have a luggage rack on top to handle the overflow.

In closing I would like to say the Ford Explorer is an excellent chose for the young, old and anyone in between.

My truck was the best decision I ever made!!<br><br>
