            I bought the 2003 Ford Escape XLT in October 2002.  I have had no problems so far with the exception of a sticky accelerator (there is a service bulletin out to fix that one, so the repair job wasn't too big of a pain).  The standard features on this car weren't enough for me, so I got leather seats, power front driver's seat, Mach 3 stereo system (in-dash,6 CD, w/radio).  I opted not to get the moon roof and the running boards which all of the models in inventory seemed to have.  My car had to be ordered, and it took about 6 weeks to get it in from the manufacturer.  One of the standard features is the auto-headlight delay off.  It takes about 10 minutes for your headlights to go off after turning off the car and removing the key.  This feature did not work when I got my car, but it turned out that the factory forgot to tell my car's computer to do this, so the guys at the service department activated it for me.  Well, you'd think that 5 minutes would be sufficient to have the lights turn off.  Ten seems awfully long, especially when you are waiting, and waiting and waiting for them to go off and everyone who walks by your car feels the need to remind you that you left your lights on.  I stopped using the feature after the first time.  Comfort-wise, the seats are wide enough, but not quite soft enough.  I find that my legs go numb after about 1 - 2 hours of driving.  However, with the power seat adjustment, there are endless combinations of seat height, distance from front/back and the angle of the seat you can use to adjust it for maximum comfort.  The only problem with that is that if you raise the seat so you are sitting very high (like I do), your keys will constantly hit you in the knee.  I have noticed a common complaint among Escape owners about the ignition keyhole.  It's in a weird place and you really have to look for it to get your key in it.  There is no light for it either, so you have to keep your door open when you are starting your car at night.  After five months I still have to look for it.

Passenger and cargo room are plentiful in the Escape.  It seats four adults very comfortably, and has the most rear legroom of all the cars of comparable size I checked out. I keep four collapsible crates in the back cargo area.  That space is huge, so the crates keep things from shifting around too much.  The cargo cover has two slots to adjust coverage, depending on the recline of the back seats.  I got an after-market cargo liner, but could probably have skipped it.  I just didn't want the carpet in the back to get messed up.  

One other issue I have with the design of this car is the ventilation system.  They do not provide you with a "recirculate" option for air, only a "fresh" setting.  This annoys me to no end because I live in the country where the smell of manure fills the air every day.  I don't want their so-called "fresh" air in my car!  P.U.!!  The owners manual refers to some sort of recirculate setting, but they don't encourage you to use it.  Makes me wonder if carbon monoxide is an issue with them!  

Other goodies:  The sound system is awesome and easy to operate.  There's also plenty of storage in the console between the front seats.  The cup holders are OK (took me a while to get used to them).  The car is pretty good on gas mileage.  I get about 27 mpg.  Acceleration is excellent.  The first time I passed someone on a back country road, I felt like I was flying.  

Other baddies:  None that I can think of right now.
