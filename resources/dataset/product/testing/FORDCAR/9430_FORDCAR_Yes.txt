            Ford Mustang is one of the most recognizable Ford vehicles on the roads these days.  From the inception of this brand to the current 2003 Mustang, many designs, improvements and features have been added to Mustang.  No wonder that the 2003 model comes equipped with all the goodies that any serious car enthusiast has come to expect on this venerable brand.  I had the opportunity to test-drive this  year's model and came out very impressed by its smoothness, performance and simplicity.  The 2003 model's improvements can be observed in the stiffer accessory drive brackets and bearings that tend to reduce variability.  In addition, the Mustang sports a retuned suspension which includes new shock absorbers.  I did not suffer from the poor conditions of the road where I was test-driving the 4.6-liter V-8 Mustang.  

If you have driven any of the previous years' models of Mustang, you were perhaps annoyed by all the wind noise coming from the door handles and other areas.  What this year's model has done is that it has the wind noise.  With new shock absorbers and less noise on the road,  you are set to focus your mind on the driving.  The distraction is never needed when driving such an American classic brand.

<b>The GT model and the Standard Mustang</b>

While the standard Mustang engine is a 3.8-liter OHV V-6 which produces 190 horsepower at about 5,250 rpm and 220 foot-pounds or torque at 2,750 rpm, the GT models release way much more power.  They have a standard 4-6-liter SOHC V-8 that produces 260 horsepower at 5,250 rpm and 302 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000 rpm.  Now if you want more power as is the case for many of my friends, you can choose the Mach 1 model which has a standard 4-valve, DOHC 4.6-liter V-8 producing more than 300 horsepower.  

<b>Safety and other significant features in the Mustang</b>

Test-driving the Mustang was a breeze.  It was very responsive to my demands for more power as I got on the freeway and decided to go with the flow of traffic.  I did not have to keep my fingers crossed before any positive reaction took place.  Sporting 16-inch, polished-aluminium wheels, unique striping with "Mustang Stampede" graphics, the 2003 model leads to the "joie de vivre or conduire."   The handling was great.  One of the few things that caught my attention was the head-impact safety feature.  It encompasses a new A-pillar, headliners, sun visors and a revised D-ring seat belt attachment.  Four passengers can seat comfortably in the Mustang.  

<b>What are my impressions after all?</b>

I had no problem getting in and out of the car.  Once inside, I had enough head, hip and shoulder room.  The subcompact coupe had nice leather seats an leather-wrapped steering wheel.  While on the freeway, I had time to check the stereo system.  The AM/FM stereo is, of course, standard.   However, the CD player is optional.  The Remote Keyless Entry is standard.  

It's my opinion that the Mustang can only get better.  It's a great car for anybody who wants to be perceived as being fit, sport-oriented and hip.  This model will also appeal those who like driving irregular and uncommon vehicles.  If you are looking for something that will distinguish you on the road, a Mustang is a must.  It makes sense that this model is very popular among both sexes, young as well as more mature car enthusiasts.

The 2003 Mustang is a great ride you won't regret at all.
