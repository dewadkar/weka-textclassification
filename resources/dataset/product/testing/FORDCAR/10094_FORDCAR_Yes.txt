            <b>Introduction</b>
By looking at our brand new 2000 PowerStroke Turbo Diesel, I would say that Ford has really improved the quality of their trucks.  But, a recent visit to their website shows otherwise.  The category I have decided to place this article is actually for the 2000 5.4 liter Gasoline F350, which powered with that iddy bitty 330 CI engine can tow a whopping 5,000 lbs.  Not for a work truck, I don't think so.  If you're reading this article to find out more about the Gasoline powered F350, this review is not for you.  There is no place for diesel trucks on Epinions yet.

I recently had the honor of driving this workhorse to Las Vegas and back(250 miles one way), I found it a pleasure both on the highway and in the city.  I didn't really find anything I didn't like, lots of neutrals, but nothing overly bad.

<b>Pro's</b>
The transmission is geared so you have a granny gear, which will tow a building away, and it still has the overdrive, which will pull down <b>24 miles per gallon</b>.  And you're paying $1.60 a gallon for Diesel!  You can't beat the economy.  Depending on your driving habits, a tank(about 30 gallons) can last you over 700 miles.

The engine is somewhat sluggish for being a 7.3-liter with turbo, but with this heavy truck, a 14 second 0-60 time is more than adequate.  The Turbo really kicks in at 2,000 rpms and pulls hard right up to the redline at 3,200 rpms.

The seating in front is a 40/60-split bench, which is adjustable for the driver or the passengers.  If the driver is short and the passenger is tall, or vice verse, you'll have no problem.  The seat was pretty comfortable too, with full electric adjustments, I was pretty happy in my seating.

The sound system kicked butt!  The speakers were defined, clear, and filled the cab evenly.  The CD player was easy to operate, and easy to change options.  I was happy listening to Metallica <b>and</b> Vivaldi, each had the full accents.

In 107 degree temperature, the inside of the truck remained a crisp mid-60 degrees with the air conditioning on mid-range without significantly impacting the gas mileage.

Even with the huge stance this truck takes on, getting in is pretty easy.  I'm 5'7 and I had no problem climbing in.

Ours didn't come with a Ford Bed, but with a flatbed.  It is nicely textured, making for a non-slip surface, and an access panel quickly reveals the fifth wheel frame mounts.

Even with the seemingly hundreds of leaf springs(actually about six) in the back, the ride was smooth.  Not Cadillac smooth, but smooth enough that I forgot I was riding in a Ford.

<b>Now for my minor nuisances:
Neutral</b>
When you go to start it, since the Glo-plugs have to warm up, you get a light that says, &quot;Wait to Start&quot;, this is a Diesel thing, and after a while I found myself inserting the key as I was getting in, then it was ready after I strapped on my seatbelt.

The shifter was incredibly long, even for a work truck, I wish this truck had a slightly closer or smoother shifter.  Reverse is also all the way to the left and up.  Every time I went to shift into first from a stop, I found myself easing the clutch out worrying I was in reverse.  When moving you really have to muscle the shifter over to find reverse, so you don't have to worry about accidentally shifting into reverse while moving forward.(That and you would hear lots of grinding)

You can't see the far right of the hood because of the contours, not much of a problem, but enough to mention.  Parking became second nature after just a few cautious attempts.

I took my CD out of the player in Las Vegas and found it to be very hot, I thought it must be the Nevada desert.  Later when I got back to the Grand Canyon and 60 degree temperatures, the CD was still hot in the player.  Probably nothing to worry about, but enough to think about.

The radio reception is worthless.  I couldn�t pick up AM stations for more than fifteen minutes and FM stations had lots of static.

When fueling, if you have it on the highest setting, it will spit diesel out at you before it shuts off.  I don't know if it is the design of Diesel pumps or the poor design of the filler hose.  Either way, I just slow down when I know it is getting close to full.

<b>The only thing I found wrong with the truck that I really didn�t like:
Con</b>
Visibility is horrid.  The Louver�s on the rear window make for a very hindered look out the rear-view mirror.  The huge mirrors on the side are complimented with tiny convex mirrors that eliminate the blind spot if you have excellent eyes.  Those mirrors are so small that trying to look into them proves more work that turning around and squinting through the slats on the rear window.  Also, the XLT package should have mirror adjustments in the cab of the truck in my opinion.  This was very much missed when parallel parking.

<b>Overall</b>
I�ve constantly heard that Ford�s Diesels are much better than Chevy�s and edge out Dodge�s diesel.  If I had the need for a diesel, this would be the one I would get.

I liked it so much I volunteered the next day to repeat the drive and that�s not just because I got 3 hours of easy overtime. :)<br><br>
