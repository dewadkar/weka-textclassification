            The Ford Focus caught my eye, but not my pocketbook for over a year.  I believed that they were little boxes and felt as if I would be better off buying something different.  Boy was I wrong.  I have a 2000 Toyota ECHO and have recently purchased a 2001 Focus.  The focus seems much more stable, has better pick up and hopefully will not be as much trouble as the Echo has been.  The interior is very comfortable and the air conditioner is very cold.  Even sitting in the back seat (between two car seats) I stayed very cool.  We own a hatchback.  The "trunk space" is not overly large, but it is adequate.  I just wouldn't take it on a long trip with all the kid's stuff.  The gas mileage is great.  Average mileage is 35 per gallon.  I would suggest this car to anyone looking for a new vehicle.
