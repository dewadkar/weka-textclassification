            First of all, I bought the truck because it was cheap.  I bought used for $300 and all it needed was an alternator.  It has 154,000 miles on it and still runs strong without using any oil or leaking.
I love this truck because it easy to handle, drives and rides like a Cadillac.  I go over a bump and don't even feel it.  Unusual for a pickup truck.
It has a 300/6 cylinder in it with an E40 transmission.  It came with the towing package.  It was also used very hard in the roofing business.  Hauled a lot of weight and towed a lot of weight.  Never had to replace the shocks.
What I hate about it is that it is so light in the rear end that it slips and slides in the snow.  We had to purchase $90 a piece tires (very meaty ones at that), to place on the back.  Now it goes a lot better, but not great.
Anyone that works in the construction field should look into the purchase of one of these.  As hard as this thing was used it does not have very many dents in it.  But the paint isn't all that great.  It's thin and peels everywhere, especially on the hood.
There is a common problem with this truck as with all trucks that have the duel tank feature.  The valve on the back tank gets clogged, the sock gets clogged, and the switch valve needs to be replaced every 125,000 miles.  (At least with this one it was 125,000 miles).  No big deal it's just expensive to replace them.<br><br>
