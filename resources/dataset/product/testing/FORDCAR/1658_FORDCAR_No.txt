            SUV's, SOB's and PMS...great..what a deadly combination.  Now the old mad woman on the cell phone has something larger to hit her target w/.  I can't eescribe how angry i am w/ these tanks going down the road just waiting to slam into my 1 off show truck.  I wanted to see what this was all about so I test drove one.  There wasn't one blind spot...there were FIVE!!  I just can't see how anyone would want to drive one of these. I feel that if you are going to spend $40,000 on something why not buy some thing stylish and comfortable, i mean come on...Cadillac offers night vision now how cool is that!<br><br>
