            After the recent death of my beloved Nissan 240SX, I was in the precarious position of having to car shop in a hurry. While I did not purchase a Ford Focus, it was, however, the rental car I used during my shopping escapades. I must say, for a small car, I was really quite impressed.

First, there is a surprising amount of leg room in the front and back. I was told by the leasing office that the Focus had replaced the long produced Ford Escort..the lack of leg room was one of my chief complaints with that car. Anyone over 5'5&quot; was certain to bang their knees against the steering wheel when getting into an Escort - no such problem exists with the Focus.

The interior of the car is very contemporary in design and the controls layout is excellent. No fumbling for the lights or stereo...everything was very accessible and well lit at night. The sound system was of superior quality, coming with a standard AM/FM cassette stereo. 

Naturally, you must sacrifice amenities such as power windows and locks in most compact cars and the Focus was no exception. The ride, however was very quiet and smooth...definately a plus. I had the car for a week and I must say, I never had the feeling I was in &quot;small&quot; car.

The gas mileage was excellent at nearly 30 miles a gallon and the exterior of the car is asthetically pleasing. It's fairly sleek and somewhat sporty.

The only complaint I had was the lack of power....you don't have to worry about &quot;lead-footing&quot; it with the Focus. If you run the A/C a lot expect an even more significant loss of power. There was a notable difference while the A/C was on...even on low.

Overall, I'd say the Focus is an outstanding value for those in the market for a small to mid-sized car. It's practical, roomy and a huge improvement over the Escort!
