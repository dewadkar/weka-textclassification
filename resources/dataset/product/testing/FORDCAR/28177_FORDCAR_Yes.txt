            I am 18 years old and a recent high school graduate. My '95 Taurus GL previously belonged to my grandfather, who drove it as he's always driven his cars: cautiously and not very often. He purchased it new in 1995. It had about 55K miles on it when I got it last year. It was given to me as a gift, and that is why there is no amount listed that I paid for it (I don't recall what my grandfather paid new). At first I was a little skeptical (I'm getting grandpa's car?), but a free car is a free car. I've been driving it for about a year and now I love my Taurus.

This is a great car. I drive this car pretty hard sometimes and it takes everything I can dish out with glee. It accelerates quickly and rather smoothly, and handles well at well over the speedometer's top speed of 85. I've driven it in pretty much every kind of weather but snow (yes, even mild hurricanes... haha). It has never once let me down. I've driven it places that other cars I've driven would have simply been stuck.

It's a very roomy car. Several of my friends are over 6' and always have plenty of leg room. All the seats are soft and very comfortable. I've hauled unimaginable amounts of stuff in this car and never missed a beat (everything from fireworks to lumber to bags of concrete). I helped my friends move just last weekend... they brought an old Ford pickup and I brought my Taurus. Most of the stuff ended up in my Taurus. I know from experience that you can cram several people in its huge trunk. I've both slept and hidden in the backseat. It would be wonderful as a family car to haul the kids and their stuff, not to mention how well it serves a teen or young adult carrying around friends or what have you.

The gas mileage is another big plus. I get about 25 miles to the gallon around town I believe, and it seems that I can drive forever on or around empty. The way gas prices are today, it's nice to have a good, reasonably powerful car that isn't a gas guzzler.

Another plus is the safety of this car. I have been in two accidents in my Taurus. In one, I accidentally hit someone's rear end while parking the car. It left a basketball sized-dent in the other person's rear bumper, but my Taurus had nothing but a little scratching on the front bumper. In the other accident, I was hit in the rear passenger side of the car by a good-sized pickup probably moving about 55 mph (he didn't bother to apply brakes until *after* he hit me). The back end of my Taurus was rather battered, and required a good bit of cash to repair, but the two of us in the car at the time were left without a scratch or a bruise. Considering the size and speed of the other car, I would say this is marvelous performance in the safety region. I feel that the '95 Taurus is a very safe car.

The 1995 Ford Taurus GL, along with being reliable and safe, is actually a nice-looking car. It has a sleek, distinctive design that I've grown to like. I think it's much nicer than the new Tauruses (which I have driven also and which don't compare to this model in my opinion). It's not a Mustang, it's not a Camaro, nor is it a BMW or a Mercedes. But it is a very nice car. And I do still get a kick out of passing all of those aforementioned cars in my Taurus. Haha.

The only problem I've really run into is that the gear shift on the steering wheel column will occasionally give me trouble. I have had the gear shift stick on me a couple times, nothing serious, just took a bit of jostling to shift it. It also is a lot more difficult to shift it into gear when I am parked downhill. Besides that, I have had very few problems with the '95 Taurus GL. The cupholders are a bit flimsy and could stand to be redone, but that's a very minor concern. The only repair I've had done to it that wasn't related to my accident was that a busted water hose needed replacement. That's a pretty nice track record for a 6-year-old car.

The radio and speakers aren't bad for factory issue. I replaced the standard radio with a Blaunpunkt Toronto in-dash cd receiver. I have yet to replace the factory speakers just because I don't really have the money, but they are serving my purposes well for the moment, and sound relatively good for factory speakers.

Overall, I think the Taurus is a great car for anyone and that if you're looking to buy an affordable used car with some attractive pros and very few cons, the 1995 Ford Taurus GL is a very safe bet. When mine finally kicks the bucket (which I expect is still a good while off), I'll probably be looking for a '95 Taurus SHO to replace it.
