              Finally, a S.U.V. that was in my price range without sacrificing quality. I am 6'4 and I fit in the truck very comfortably, and the ride is still smooth for a compact. I've already logged a few thousand miles and for the most part I've been very happy with my choice. The Escape is not perfect, for example, the shift selector on the steering column hinders access to the controls on the radio, a slight aggravation at times. I guess that's one of the drawbacks in getting the first model year of a vehicle, all the kinks are not worked out yet. 
  I was not looking to buy when I stopped by the lot to pass some extra time that I had, but when I seen and eventually test drove the truck I was SOLD. It handles nice around corners, and the acceleration packs some punch. Also, with all this bad weather we've had lately going through the snow with the four wheel drive on makes the drive not only manageable but fun:)<br><br>
