            I have driven the Ford Contour and been a passenger in the Mondeo (the European Contour). The Mondeo had the Duratec V-6, while this Contour I drove only had a 2.0L Zetec. I was actually impressed with the Zetec, the car isn't underpowered. The six cylinder is better, in the Mondeo we accelerated out of stoplights and on to motorways with no problem. The main problem with the Contour now is that it's obsolete. The Ford Focus has more interior room, and is an overall better car. If you are looking for a used car, the Contour/Mystique are great, but for new cars, I would go for the Focus. It is cheaper, better looking and as good, if not a better overall car.

I was really impressed by the handling or the Contour. I went around cul-de-sacs at 30 to 35 m.p.h. and the car didn't tilt at all. The steering is also very responsive, it moves right with your hands on the wheel. On the highway, with the overdrive feature, the car is smooth and has enough power to pass at up to 80 m.p.h. The suspension is also very well done. I went over bumps and pot-holes in the road with minimal jarring inside the cabin. We didn't glide over them, but the Contour handled them better than most cars in its class. The car is a little slow, partially because of the 2.0L Zetec, but I don't think it was as bad as other 2.0L engines. I went up some fairly steep hills, and the Contour was a little slow, but still delivered a good amount of power. 

The interior has some good areas and some bad. The front seats are excellent. They have great lower back support, and really hold you in. This is the exact opposite of the Tempo. The controls are high, enabling you to reach them with no problem. This does make the front windshield appear smaller, but the view from it is still good. The cup holders are a little to low and out of reach, but they are the first that I have seen that don't block anything. The rear is a little crowded, and there isn't much headroom (This is one aspect of the Contour that I don't like. The Focus is superb in rear headroom.). The isn't much leg room either, but for young kids, the car would be fine. The trunk is surprisingly cavernous. It could probably hold more luggage than necessary, since the car could hold four adults for a few hours at most. 

The stereo was very powerful. I turned it up fairly loud, and heard no distortion. I didn't see a place to adjust the treble or bass, but I think that the speakers could have handled quite a bit of bass. I would get the car with a CD player, because from what I heard, the speakers were very good.

I didn't like the power door locks. They made an annoying uuuuuhnt whenever you unlocked or locked the doors. This noise lasted a few seconds, and I really started to get annoyed by it. The middle climate control was very busy with about 10 places to but the knob. They were all written with words and not pictures, so it took a while to figure out where to put it. The car wasn't very quiet either. I heard a little pebbles hitting the car from the inside and had a lot of wind noise.

Overall, the Contour is a great car to drive. I would recommend it for young families with young kids. Buying a used one is a good idea too, since they usually are sold for very cheap prices. <br><br>
