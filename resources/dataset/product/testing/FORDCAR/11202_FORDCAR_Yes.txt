            I was looking for another family car, when I ran across this 95 Crown Vic, fully loaded with leather.  I tried to talk myself out of it, because of all the stigmas that go with it, such as "senior citizen car", "cop car", etc.  But the more I looked at it and then after driving it, I was pretty much sold on the car for $5550.  The car runs out great with its 4.6L V8, and never have I had a reason to wish for more power.  It seats my family of 4 very comfortably and the trunk is large enough for 3 adults to sit in and be comfortable.  The brakes are good, only you will replace them often due tho the fact that they are only single piston floating caliper disk brakes on the front and they are required to do a lot of braking due to the weight of the car. I have had the car for about a year, and I bought it in excellent condition.  I have replaced the brakes all the way around, and put new shocks on the car as well.  It now has 71,000 miles on it, I bought it with 49,991.  I have had no mechanical problems with the car AT ALL!!  The car aside from not being the sleekest vehicle on the market is probably one of the best that I have ever owned, and that is from an all around view point.  The interior is well appointed and all the controls are very easy to operate.  There is one big plus to owning this car...and that is that if it makes you angry when people don't use their directional lights or people that make crazy moves on the freeway, don't worry.  Seems like since I have been driving this car, people are more cautious driving around me...at least till they figure out I am not a police officer.
