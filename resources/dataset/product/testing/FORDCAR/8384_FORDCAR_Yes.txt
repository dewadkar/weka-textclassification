            We bought a used 1992 Ford Explorer two years ago and went up from a car to this.  I love it!  We have talked a few times about going back to a car b/c of the payments and stuff, but once we drive a car on the lot, I cannot go back to one.  I love the room in our explorer.  Our daughter likes her room in the backseat and I like all the room in the front.  

I also like being able to sit up high and see the road in front of you and not have to stretch my neck to see what's ahead.  I recently drove a rental car my brother has--it is a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am--I like the looks of those cars so decided I'd drive it to see if I liked it.  NO WAY!  For one--with small children there is no room for all of their stuff.  And it was so low it felt like my rear was about to touch the ground!  

Though our explorer is a few years old, we are planning on getting a newer one someday!  Hopefully sooner than later, but for now ours is in great shape and has held up great for us.  <br><br>
