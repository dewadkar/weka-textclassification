              Have you heard of the Mnemonic (Fix Or Repair Daily)?  Well, if you've ever owned a FORD, you know it's far from the truth!  My husband has owned Fords for the last fifteen year and they have never let him down.  My husband now owns a 1998 Ford F150.  We have two kids and can travel comfortable.  The back seat is comfortable and is roomy enough for our two kids.  Of course, there is no comparison with the room that we have in our Ford Expedition, but it sure beats the space in most trucks.  The only thing I dislike about this vehicle is that it doesn't have a cd player.  This vehicle drives smoothly and is very dependable.  The gas mileage is okay and it is a great truck for the whole family<br><br>
