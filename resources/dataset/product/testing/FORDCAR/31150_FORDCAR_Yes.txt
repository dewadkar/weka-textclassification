               <b>A</b>lthough the Ford Mustang GT/LX boasted somewhat of a muscle car monopoly during the 1980s, it still did not have the same romance or sex appeal as the very original. For 1994 an all new styled Mustang arrived, which has become progressively more sophisticated into the '98 model year. 

<i>Driving Impressions</i>     

<b>C</b>ompared to third generation Mustang's, the 1998 Mustang GT has much better ergonomics and feels tighter.  Rattling or squeeking while driving on smooth road surfaces is kept almost devoid from the '98 Mustang GT's cabin. The SOHC 4.6 liter modular V8 in the 1998 Mustang GT, however, does not have as much torque as the old 5.0 and doesn't feel as powerful either. <b>Acceleration</b> is still good however. Fully loaded with people and with the AC blasting this car still has the power to move from the light with no fuss whatsoever. <b>Handling</b> is noticeably better than the previous generation, and much less understeer. <b>Braking</b> is excellent and feels safe, with standard ABS and four wheel disc brakes. This brake set-up is something only the older Ford Mustangs could dream about. <b>Fuel economy</b> was average, I got about 23 MPG on the freeway. The 1998 Mustang GT offers truly refined American performance and continues to get better almost every year. Test drive a 2002 Mustang GT, you'll see what I mean.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>
   

The <b>interior</b> of the '98 GT is far superior over its predecessor. A twin-cowl dashboard layout adds a retro touch which dates back to the original Mustang. Cruise control, twin air bags, air conditioning, tilt steering, well executed comfortable leather seats, power door locks, mirrors and lumbar supports are standard on the GT models.  My 1 year owned GT came with auto head-lamps and power seating with height adjustments. A convertible is offered for this car, but no T-tops like the Camaro's. Room is good up front, but kids only in the back, as there is hardly any leg room, and head room is awful in the rear!   

   <i>Reliability:</i> 

I owned this car for 1 year, I got rid of it because of gas prices in 1999. But it was a super reliable machine. A little low on power compared to the competition, but it was a blast to drive. 

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

 The <b>exterior</b> is awesome. A sleek design with a combination of curves and lines. Despite my dislike for the rear tail lamps, I would say that this was one of the best looking cars I have ever owned.

<i>Pricing:</i>

 The <b>price</b> for these cars are going for almost nothing, especially since Ford has a new 260 HP revised Mustang since 1999. I have seen 98 GTs go for as low as 5,000 dollars.. whoo hooo!..How is that for bang for your buck?!
