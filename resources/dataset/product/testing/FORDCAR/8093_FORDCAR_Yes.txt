            I bought my 2001 Ford Explorer Sport about 2 months ago. I have driven it about 2100 miles thus far. About 3 months ago I got into an accident with my 1999 Ford Mustang (which I loved to death). I was going to buy another Mustang, but when I got to the dealership I saw the 2001 Explorer Sport. I fell in love with it immediately. I never owed an SUV and never wanted to, until I saw the Sport. 

I live in New York where parking is hard to come by. With the Sport parking isn't a tough as I thought it will be. The Sport is compact but very roomy at the same time. There is ample storage space in back, and if you fold down the seats two people could sleep back there. 

The Leather seats are so comfortable. Several passengers of mine have fallen asleep after sitting in the back seat for about 30 minutes. The front seat adjust into several comfortable positions. The Sport definitely score points on it's comfortability.

The Factory stereo that comes with the Sport "Sucks". If you play the cd player for to long the cds get really hot which causes the player to skip a lot. I feel that a cassette deck should have been added to the system. When I bought by Mustang the system was great. Ford should have use the same stereo system (MACH) with the Explorer Sport.

Gas mileage really sucks. This truck eats gas like a man in the desert finally getting some water. Ford really needs to increase the fuel efficiency on this vehicle. 

Overall, I think that this is a good truck to get. If you have many kids or people to transport then this probably wouldn't be a good choice. The Sport can only hold 4 passengers. It may hold five if the people aren't to big. The Sport is very comfortable, roomy, and has a really great new design. It's also has a poor stereo and get poor mileage.
