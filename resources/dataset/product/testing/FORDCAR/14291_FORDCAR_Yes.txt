               The first thing I noticed about this truck was the body lines.  They are catchy, but overall, not great.  They look modern, but still have a classic style about it that is absolutley fabulous.
   The interior of the truck was great, really comfortable and a whole lot of room.  The extended wheelbase makes it easy to carry people or cargo in the bed or both.  It also it insulated very well, as it keep cold and noise out, although on a diesel you can hear some noise.   
   The ride was good. Very smooth although you could feel some bumps, there weren't many.  
   The loading of the truck was hard.  It took two people because of the height of the truck and it was hard to raise the tailgate.
   The power of the truck is unbelievable.  It has so much torque and really good throttle response.  With a few modifications, this could easily be a truck to run at a drag strip.
