            I recently turned my lease car in and decided to opt for a an affordable used car that got good mileage.  I took my time looking around and test driving various models.  I found a Ford Focus SE on a lot with a sporty appearance package.  I'm somewhat of an auto enthusiast, and was very impressed when I took the Focus for a spin.  I felt like I was driving a brand new import.  The car had close to 50,000 miles on it.  The car felt as if it was brand new and didn't have any rattles or squeaks in it at all.  The model I purchased was an SE, but it was loaded with options.  It had everything a loaded ZTS had except for a sunroof and traction control.  After some negotiating I was able to take it home for $7200.  I would of had to pay over $10,000 for a similar Honda, Nissan, or Toyota.  To my surprise the sporty econobox had 16" Z-rated tires mounted on sporty aluminum rims.  The Focus also had the optional 2.0 Zetec motor coupled to a 5 speed manual transmission.  The car has typical 4 cylinder low end torque, but screams when anywhere near the near 7,000 RPM redline.  I've never experienced an American made motor than seemed so smooth at high RPMs.  In fact, it sounds just as smooth as my friends Honda V-tech.  This is my eighth car purchase and my best one yet.  

My only real complaint with my Focus is the gas mileage.  My driving habits are split pretty even between city and highway, and I always average a mediocre 24 mpg.  I had an Oldsmobile Alero with a 3.4 V6 that got just as good mileage.  I also know that most of the Hondas and Toyotas, in the same class, are in the low 30 mpg range.  If I had one other complaint, it would have to be the "tall styling".  The car is about the same height as a 2WD Toyota pick-up.  This doesn't exactly scream sporty.

All in all, I'm very happy with my Focus.  Over the years I've gotten use to the small little everyday imperfections in an American car, but I haven't had to do that with the Focus.  It's difficult to say how it will hold up in the years to come, but it runs with the imports now and for a much smaller price.
