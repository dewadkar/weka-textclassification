            My husband owns a Ford F-150 supercab. It holds our 3 children plus 3 adults easily. Plus with room to haul things. We have owned ours for over a year now bought new and wouldn't trade it for anything. We bought it because my husband is a truck person but we needed the extra room for our kids. When we started out it was just me and him now we added to our family it just wasn't possible for us to own a small truck. It is easy to handle and we have had no mechanic trouble. It is good for a person who likes trucks but needs extra room. <br><br>
