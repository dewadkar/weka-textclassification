            It has only been 500 miles since I picked up my new Explorer Sport, but already I'm sure it is more fun to drive than my previous '93 XLT.  I may regret the choice of color (Black), looks great when clean but dirties quickly. 
 Side step rails tend to accumulate snow and dirt, however this was quickly fixed with the installation of front mud flaps. Rear mud flaps will soon follow.  Since '93 the front seats seem to have been moved forward so there does not seem to be as much leg room.  Perhaps this is just a condition of the 2-door model to allow more rear space.  The shorter wheelbase also results in a slightly more choppy ride yet quicker steering. 
 The SOHC V-6 option is well worth the few hundred dollars cost. With this engine there seems to be more than enough power to accelerate quickly and deal with light towing. 
If you drive alone or with just one other passenger it hardly seems worth the extra two thousand bucks for the 4-door model.  While the additional doors are a convenience, the 2-door model looks a lot more sporty.<br><br>
