            <i>Talk about suffering! After all the years of costly repairs, I made the mistake of buying another Toyota - a 1988 "4-Runner" - one that had 200K miles on it but one I fancied would be a 'hobby' car. One that I could tinker with and be able to drive in the sometimes bad weather here in northern Nevada. Sure! Sorry, this vehicle was a voracious monster that ate $100 Bills for breakfast. Within a couple of months, the rear window would not open, that prevented the hatch from opening, the 2 door model made access to the cargo area very difficult. This critical flaw rendered this popular and celebrated SUV impractical and nearly useless. Bids to fix were outrageous; exceeding the value of the entire collection of errors.</i>

Note: Two days after publishing this review, I had the Ranger front end inspected - a slight pull to the left.  Front disc (ABS) brakes rebuilt - $569.23 

<b>OUCH ! That's 28 hours of my new part-time job. Phooey!</b>
or ("How Ford Has Caught Up With Toyota")  

For 2 years I suffered with a worn out piece of Toyota Junk, a 1988 4 Runner; "The Beast" as opposed to "Beauty". And lusted for something else. Not just anything else. Just a simple vehicle that would go with me to the dump when I wanted to go; that would not attract thieves, nor fire other drivers' Indy 500 fantasies.

The object of my affection was going to be the <b>Ford Ranger</b> extended cab pickup. Simplicity a must. I practically gave away the "Beast" - flush with that success, I resolved to do without a second vehicle. And did it, too. For 5 months, we endured living with our 1998 Ford Explorer. I had experimented with a trash run and a load of bricks from Home Depot - both of which left Marilyn hostile to such uses - it is her 'Cruise Ship' and she does not want the leather messed up. Then came Winter 2002. It was 4:45am, I had just delivered my wife to her job at Mervyn's California; where she was to do some brute force tasks before opening time.  I was free for a time. A good time to look for a car.

Thanks to a good neighbor, I had read the <b><i>'Click and Clack'</i></b> column and newsletters; which had given me several strategies for coping with new car obsolescence. I was looking for the "7 & 3" solution - buy something at age 7, keep it 3 years and dump it. (We already had the "3 & 7" solution - the 1998 Explorer. I had been seeing those Ford Rangers all over the place, seemingly complacent drivers simply going somewhere in "my car". I was also impressed by Ford designs and by <b>mkp51</b>'s happiness with his Ranger. 

And so, at 5:15am on a snowy morning, I began the search. The local Ford dealer had two of the extended cab design on the lot; a good place to find a decent car per "Click and Clack". They assure us that a dealer will not keep a liability on the sales lot. Scraping the snow away, I could see that one was an Automatic, the other a Stick shift. Neither had a camper shell; the cargo bed thus being accessible. <i>Weather sensitive cargo, such as groceries, belongs in the cab anyway.)</i> I went home and did my "Kelley Blue Book" - I was now fully prepared to deal and wheel.

I began by driving the least dangerous (to the pocketbook) one, the stick shift model. It had a good feel to it so I asked if I could "borrow" it for a while to have my mechanic go over it. <i>Unlike a family doctor (which I cannot afford), I <b>DO</b> have a family mechanic.</i> Who told me it was more or less OK but overpriced at the asking $10,500. "Offer them $7,000" was his advice. I paid him his $50 consultation fee and did just that. They took the offer. I then had the rear wheel brakes (Shoe type) renewed for $105, changed the timing and fan belt and had the car of my dreams.

<b>WHAT I GOT:</b>

Four (yes, 4) Cylinder Engine
Five Speed OD Manual Transmission
Power Brakes (ABS) and Steering
Manual Window Cranks and Door Locks
Sliding Tinted rear cab window
Heater and Fresh Air Venting
AM/FM Cassette Factory radio
Manual Door Locks and Rear View Mirrors
After-Market Cruise Control
P215/14 Michelin Tires - 30% tread left.
Perfect wheel alignment and clean oil
Seven (7) very obvious scratches and gouges in the dark green metallic paint - 'hidden' with one of those tiny bottle of touch-up paint.
One small dent in the cargo bed
81,300 miles - "Well broken in" 
26 Miles Per Gallon - Regular 87 'Octane' fuel

Eleven 1/3 Yard loads of pea gravel
Three trips to the County Dump
Several grocery runs in rotten weather
Lots of fun making this thing 'go'
We are saving the Cruise Ship "for good";
-- like uh, Church! Shopping! Commuting!

<b>CONCLUSIONS and OBSERVATIONS</b>

All of those handy but costly luxury items are absent - looming repairs are few, and cheap*. This pickup handles very well. The cargo bed is usually empty - with a load the handling becomes a bit more sensitive but it does not wallow around. Acceleration is always a surprise to me. In Nevada, the Cowboy/NASCAR/Marlboro/Egomaniac moods prevail - result, I usually have the highway to myself until the next traffic light - which I usually time carefully to have a green light waiting for me. Drives those Expedition/Tahoe drivers nuts (They don't use accelerators, they have a "GO" switch on the floor.)  

* Dream On

The tires are a mystery, being a size under Ford factory specifications (P225/14). The wheel wells look empty; perhaps the previous owner wanted to look 'cool'. The mud flaps are after market and cheap - they do flap mud all over the body. Discussions with a couple of tire dealers and observations in parking lots indicate that, if desired, the P235/15 size (Explorer spec) could be accommodated. Nevertheless, the handling is snappy, the ride is unexpectedly quiet and the fuel consumption is great - 30% better than that of our "Cruise Ship" Explorer; which is 'Auto Everything'.  

Shifting is smooth, the tiny little 4 Cylinder engine whispers at moderate RPMs - not much need for more power. When I have driven for a while, I frequently realize that I have forgotten the Overdrive gear - Engine braking is easy and predictable, the transmission is a dream; although starting out in 2nd gear is not good for the clutch. The radio lets us hear Cassettes I recorded in the 1970's - Maria Callas sounds great (I just gave away the last of our Vinyl collection - some dating to 1961).

<b>FLAWS</b>

1. The rear cab window is finished with highly reflective glass tinting. The rear view mirror catches the reflection of what is out in front of the car and I am always startled by the sight of my right hand as it goes through the gears. This is distracting, especially when maneuvering in a parking lot.

2. The cab has distinctive styling, the quarter panel windows have very large blind spots that demand a lot of rubbernecking when clearing for lane changes or when maneuvering, especially in reverse. If one has a sore neck, don't drive. This styling may be based on recent driver habits and their near congenital rudeness. Most drivers don't bother to look; figuring that the driver who is behind or beside shouldn't be there. 

<i>I drove a 1979 Datsun short bed and cab pickup, a 1600 model; for 14 years. Much of that was short distance but the cramped cab was a constant nuisance. That little truck got around; we moved 90% of our belongings over a 10,000 foot elevation mountain pass - 110 miles each way over the Sierras - using that small but adequate import. So, I expected a lot from Ford - and have gotten what I wanted. The Datsun had A/C that never worked for the last 12 years; so the Ranger's lack is tolerable. When comfort is an issue, we have the Ford Explorer at the ready. The Ranger is a well-tested solution to those dreaded problems we make for ourselves.

After 3 1/2 years of retirement, the siren call of money was heard and I took a part-time position in nearby Alpine County, California. Sure enough, the first day of work, April 17th, was a snowy one and the highway to Markleeville was icy. 44 years of driving experience and regular tread Michelin Tires (I carry chains) got me through OK. 

We recommend The Ranger Design - all years.
