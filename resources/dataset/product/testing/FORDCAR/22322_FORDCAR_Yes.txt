            My wife and I have been shopping for a new car for a while now and when we test drove the Expedition, we literally fell in love with it.This is the vehicle for us. We own a liquidations business so we make business trips often. This vehicle is very professional and good looking so I would not be embarrased to drive up to a client in it. It also has lots of room for our son. It has three rows of seats and the back seat is easy to remove of fold down for more storage. The Expedition is a large vehicle and feels very safe. Even though it is large, it doesn't feel large when you sit in it. It is easy to handle and drives more like a car than an SUV. My wife's back starts hurting when we take long trips but it doesn't bother her in this vehicle with is adjustable lower lumbar support. Everything is in the drivers reach which makes it nice if the front passenger is sleeping. It also has A/C controls for the middle and back seats for the other passengers comfort. When Ford made the Expedition, they had the buyer in mind. The Expedition has my highest recommendation for purchase by anyone that takes long trips or needs extra space in a vehicle.<br><br>
