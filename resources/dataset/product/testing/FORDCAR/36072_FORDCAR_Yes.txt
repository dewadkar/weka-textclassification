              To start, let me state that what is defined in terms of an economy
  car (12,000 to upwards of almost 17,000 on some models), is a 
  large chunk of money for me.  This is my main car.  I test drove
  a Mazda Protege, Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, and
  Dodge Neon.  I bi-passed Saturn, Kia, and Daewoo due to lackluster
  reviews.  I choose the Ford Focus because I actually felt like
  I was buying a much more expensive, well-equipped car than any
  of the competition offered for the same money.  

  The Ford Focus must and should be compared to other cars in its
  class.  It is not a Lexus or a BMW.  However, it IS a very
  nice offering.  It is very spacious for a small sedan.  I personally
  find the seats exceedingly comfortable - the front bucket seats
  give a feeling of being slightly raised with a comfy chair like
  quality.  The dash is simple and sleek - I find the controls very
  simple to read (some reviewers think they are complicated?)  My
  model is the SE with an upgrade to the sports group which includes
  the more powerful ztec engine.  The SE comes equipped with standard
  air, power windows and mirrors, keyless entry and a cd.  Very nice.  
  Easy to operate and convenient.  

  As for the exterior design - I think it is sporty and sleek.  Mine
  is the sports group, so it has the spoiler.  The twilight blue
  (dark blue) metallic is fierce.  It doesn't look like everyone and
  his brother's Honda and Toyota.  (Like I said I test drove both
  the corolla and civic and was very disappointed - small interiors,
  tinny feel, sparse equipment for the money - they are starting
  to really operate on name and past reputation - it was like they
  didn't even try).  

  The ride and handling on this car is great.  Crisp handling, 
  more than adequate power with the upgraded engine (I don't know
  about the lower grade engine - test drive and see for yourself).
  The ztec zips up the hills of my hilly New England town.  I have
  the five speed for the added boost, and the manual is the
  choice from all the professional reviews I have read
  (which are plenty), including Consumer Reports.  

  In sum, I would highly recommend test driving this car, if you
  are in the market for a small sedan (with a big car feel!)  It
  was the only car I test drove and felt it was worth endeavoring
  on car payments.  I realize that Fords past reliability record
  is a consideration (I must admit it did give me pause), but
  this car seems smooth and very well put together.  Let's hope
  Ford turns it around with this car.  

  My final word - love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it,
  love....

  sleek and cool....the little groovy car that could!<br><br>
