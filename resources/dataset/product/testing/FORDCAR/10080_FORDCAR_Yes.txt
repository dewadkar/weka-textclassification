                 My Dad has always been a pick-up man. I never gave that much thought, until I moved away. Then, I noticed all the times that a truck comes in handy. It really gets old trying to find a friend with a truck to carry home big items like bikes from K-Mart and to haul in a load of wood for the fireplace.

     I�ve been back �home� for 6 years now, so trucks are no problem now. I can ride with Dad to do truck stuff or borrow his truck when my car is in the shop. 

     Dad has always leaned toward Ford trucks though he has had a couple of other brands. His latest truck is the Ford Ranger SuperCab. He goes with the SuperCab now, so family members can ride along. We used to ride in the bed when I was a kid, but that is a no-no now. 

     If you have grown folks riding in the truck, then you probably want a full cab model, but the Ranger works fine for little people. My boys ride in the push down seats behind the front seats on a regular basis. I sit back there some, but I can say that it is a high step up, tight to climb in behind the seats, and it is cramped back there if you ride more than 20 miles or so. 

     Since this is a bumper seat set-up in the back, they have the small doors in the back that open like a book to the front doors. This means more room getting in as the back door would be too small opening like dominos, but the fold over set up means you have to been real careful about little kid fingers. Kids are more likely to have fingers in the center than in the back space with a regular closing door. 

     Another thing I would mention on those small back doors is that you have to shut them really firmly to latch properly. I don�t think they would swing open down the road, since the front doors overlap. But, they do make the light come on that indicates an open door if you don�t push them real tight.

     If you don�t plan to haul kids or friends around in the back seats, then you can flip them up and have the extra open space. That leaves a good area for groceries or for suitcases. Just click the button to pop the front seats forward, and you have a nice area for storage. I would just as soon not throw my groceries or my clothes in the bed of a pick-up, so that works out good. 

     Let me get out of the back seat though that can be fun too . . .

     If you�re kind of short (like under my height of 5�4�), then you may have trouble hopping up in this truck. Since it�s 4 wheel drive, it sits up high. I can make it OK, but I have to take a little hop to get up. If you�re short or beyond hopping, then you probably do not want this truck (or a 4 wheel drive at all). You could get one with a step on it though, but I would say you would want to do that.  No one wants a vehicle they climb into. This truck is probably designed for guy-people though I enjoy the truck too. It�s just scaled higher and is not that female friendly.

     When you get in, you don�t feel like you�re in a truck. I�ve been in many a truck, but this one is more rounded and has a cozy sort of feel. I love that as far as the front panel and the sides. They curve in and are easy to get to. Dials are easy to reach and to see too since they are large. The only thing I don�t like is the curving seats. Maybe I�m just used to the straight back chair feel of pick-ups, but the curves in the Ranger don�t match my body. Again, this may be the size thing. My Dad loves the Ranger seat, but he is taller than I am. Even when I adjust the seat, I feel like I am straining forward . . . and I am.

     OK. I�m a little hunched forward when I drive, but this is the easiest truck I�ve ever driven. It really handles like a car. Usually I have to man handle trucks, but this one is a piece of cake. I need a little more space for turns . . .but not much. Reaction time is quick on the wheel. Brakes are great. They upgraded those, and I can tell the difference from earlier models.

     When I�m driving and things are good, then I like to play around a little. 

     The first thing I notice is that the windows are strange. If you push the button and let up, then the window goes all the way down. I am used to push and hold for all the way. Maybe this is for tobacco chewers so they can get the window down fast. I�m not sure. I end up with a wide open window and then push and push to get it up where I want it. 

     The Ranger has a good heat/cool system, so you don�t have to do the window thing. I just like windows down myself. I�m guessing I will retrain myself on those, but those windows are strange to me.

     Once I have the window down, then I want some music. I�m glad the standard is the CD player. You can add the 6 player, but my Dad is not that big on music. The regular package is nice though, and I only have a radio in my car (so I sure can�t complain). Radio is good and CD player is great. This is all you need for the cab space, unless you plan to have a party and open the windows for the music.

     I usually have to stop for a Pepsi. I can put that right in the middle where I can reach it. The holes are deeper than most, so the can does not tip over. There are 2 spaces for drinks and a dipped in area for snacks. I appreciate those spaces, since my car is not good with those things.

    The curved front dash area is not where you�ll want to throw things. They slide to the front where you can�t reach your stuff. The back area is good, and the glove box is fine. Things in the front glare anyway, so I needed to break myself from that anyway.

     I guess some folks want to know more on the power thing . . .

     This is a V-6, and it has good pull. It does not have the same get up and go as my old Mustang, but it�s fine unless you are a real speed demon. Some of my guy friends are waiting for the 2003 with the bigger engine. This is plenty for me.

     Since I drive a Toyota Corolla on a regular basis and get about a million miles to the gallon, the 16 average mpg on this one puts a dint in my pocketbook. On the flip side, this truck can haul more and go more places. I wouldn�t take it on a road trip when it takes way more gas than my little car. But, I�d much rather get a Christmas tree with this truck than my Corolla.

      My Dad�s Ranger is the 4 wheel drive. You can get it 2 wheel or 4 wheel. I think the 4 wheel is kind of a status thing, since we live in NC where do not have that much mud or snow. It is nice when we go into more backwoods areas. My Dad had other 4 wheel drives that had combination things to put those into gear to do that. This one has a little button and is auto. That is nice. I don�t have to think about what to do. Push the button. You�re in 4 wheel drive.

     Don�t put the Ranger in 4 wheel on the road. It kind of skips sideways if you do. Wait for mud or snow. Then it kicks in with a push of the button and does a good job. The Ranger is loads of fun on those few days we have snow or when we drive back out in the country on bad dirt roads. It definitely does the job. It grabs and does what it is supposed to do.

     One other thing I would mention is that you can also push a button and turn off the side air bag. That is good if you have a really small friend or a kid in the truck. I turn that off for my 12 year old or for any really small college students riding in the truck.

     As far as add-ons . . .
 
     A bed liner and a hitch are good ideas. This truck will pull campers and boats and that sort of stuff. That�s what makes it fun. If you haul stuff, then the liners keep the truck in good shape. If you don�t haul stuff, then I�m not sure why you need or want a truck.

    Well, I might know why this is fun even if you don�t haul stuff . . .

     When I�m driving my Dad�s truck, I almost always have someone stop me and tell me that I have a neat truck. The Ranger is sportier than most trucks. It has that rounded front and nice grill that say �cool� rather than �utilitarian.�  It�s really a cute deal.

     Would I buy this truck?

     That�s kind of a hard call. If my Dad didn�t have his, then I would have to think hard about that. It�s really nice to have a truck to haul things and one that will hold the family too. So, this is the one I would look at. Since I can borrow my Dad�s truck, I like having the full size back seats in a car and the better gas mileage. It�s the best of best worlds, but I would sure miss the Ranger if I moved again.
