            My mother recently bought an 2000 Eddie Bauer Expedition and she loves it. It has seating for eight and a lot of space with the seats folded down.  This is extremely important to her because she is constantly driving a lot of people around and always has boxes in her car for one reason or another.  

This car features a V-8 290 horsepower engine, upgraded stereo, leather interior, 4-wheel drive, and an all around luxurious interior and exterior.  This car is great for those of you who always are driving people are or are always moving some sort of cargo around.  The 290 horsepower engine is more than enough power for this car.  Unfortunately, this drives like a truck though it has a lot of power.  Though it don't think that the Expedition handles well, it is not that bad considering the size of the vehicle.  Also, this translates into terrible gas mileage.  It gets between 13-18 miles per gallon which is terrible, but the gas tank is around 30 gallons.  Though the mileage is bad, you really don't have to fill up that often.  Therefore, if gas prices are not an issue, this is not a car that you will need to fill more than once a week. 

I do not find the Expedition to be an enjoyable to always be driving around.  This is due to the fact the car is enormous and it is difficult to go around corners in some areas and like I said the handling leaves a lot to be desired.  This car does not drive the best, but for a vehicle of it's size, it really does not drive badly.  Also, if this is the size vehicle you want, there are really not that many option, expect for the Navigator.

I would recommend a Ford Explorer or a Jeep Grand Cherokee before an Expedition. I have driven both all of these cars and the Explorer and Cherokee handle must better.  Also, each of these vehicles that I drove had the best suspension and highest horsepower engines offered.  This means that the best was compared to the best and the Expedition just could not compete in a competition.  

I would say buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee before a Ford Expedition, but if you really want the size and space there is no better choice.  I would recommend the Expedition to a friend if they did want a SUV that is this large, otherwise, I would probably not.<br><br>
