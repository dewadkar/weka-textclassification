            In 1992, I decided to buy a full sized van because the very popular mini-vans were over priced. I got a custom Ford E-150 for thousands less than a much smaller mini-van. Ford had just redesigned their van and I quickly fell in love with this vehicle. The Ford van remains basically unchanged in 2000 so my opinions may help you make some decisions today.

In my opinion, there is no better vehicle on the market for traveling long distances than a custom Ford van. The ride is smooth, quite, relaxing and effortless. I got captains chairs which allow you to sit very upright as if you were in your living room and a VCR to entertain the children for hours of enjoyable travel. This van has been all over the country on trips from three hours to twenty-three hours and it always took us in great comfort as if we were in a large land yacht. It has massive space when you take out the seats and during these many years I have moved mountains of materials in this van.

There are things that Ford could do to improve this vehicle and maybe they have. It rusts easily around the hinges and light bulbs have a very short life expectance. The seats are difficult to remove and need to be redesigned. My van has the large six cylinder engine and it has run flawlessly ( 105,000 miles ) however if you want to tow something with this van you need to consider the larger engine.

In this day of SUV's, you might want to consider a full sized van. They are more comfortable, more spacious, more versatile and less expensive. They are true land yachts!  <br><br>
