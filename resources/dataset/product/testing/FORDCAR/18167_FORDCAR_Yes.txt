            I purchased my 1996 Ford Probe seven years and 115,000 miles ago.  In that time I've never experienced a problem outside the scope of normal maintenance.  Although I tend to be hard on a car (I blew out an engine & turbo charger on the first new vehicle I ever owned within the first year), my Probe has yet to disappoint me.

The probe was originally intended to replace the Ford Mustang.  Probe was a joint venture with Mazda, built in that company's Michigan plant with twin Mazda MX-6.  The probe was not produced after 1997.

There were two 1996 Probe models, SE and GT.  I chose the SE which at 118-hp 2.0-liter dohc 4-cylinder, hooked to a standard 5-speed manual has more than enough power.  In fact, I found it to be far smoother & more powerful than a similarly equipped Mustang.

Standard equipment includes dual airbags, AM/FM 4 speaker stereo, and a 50/50-split fold-down rear. The rear seat, although small, has more legroom than the competition (Talon, Eclipse, Prelude, or Celica). 

I had every intention of trading the car in at the end of four years, but now that I'm hitting four years (now way past four year -- seven) with still no problems, I'm looking forward to life without car payments for a while.  I recently got the desire to get a new 4wd vehicle to hit the beach here in South Padre, but convinced myself to buy an old Jeep to use on the beach since the Probe still runs so well for regular daily use as well as long distance on the highway.
