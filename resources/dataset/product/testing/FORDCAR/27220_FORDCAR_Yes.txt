                 I wanted gold for my 15th wedding anniversary.  I was not expecting this much gold.  My Focus is called Fort Knox Gold.  It is more beige in color.  When I sat in this car. I knew it was going to be mine, besides the fact Ford credit said so. I like the fact this car was final assembled at Wayne assembly plant located in Wayne Michigan.  My father in law works there, which is a plus when buying a car.I wish we made our cars 100% in the United States.  

     I picked this car, because of the Ford name.  I have come from a family of Ford people.  I like to keep that tradition going since I have had good luck with Fords.

     My Focus is a ZTS sedan, It is a 4 door. 2 bucket seats in the front and a bench seat for 3 in the back seat.  I really like the fact there are 3 shoulder harness belts in the back seat.  I feel much safer seating my children back there.

     Another thing I liked about my new car is gas mileage in the city it gets 25 MPG and the highway is 31 MPG depending on the driving habits you can get 29 MPG city and 36 MPG highway.The estimated  annual fuel cost is 749.00.

     There is driver and passenger side air-bags.  I don't like that fact you can't turn off the passenger. I keep my children under 12 from sitting in the front seats, for their safety.  

     I can also adjust my steering wheel.  toward me, away from me, up and down.  I also can adjust my seat anyway I like.  especially  us tall drivers verses my short husband driver.  

     For us ladies who don't pay attention to the gas.  There is a low fuel light.  When this comes on it is time to make a visit to the local gas station.  Child safety door locks.  Now you don't have to worry about unlocked doors that children can fall out.  When the car is put in drive all the doors lock.  

     Do you hate it when you scratch your paint with your keys? Here you go, keyless entry.  You have a little remote that unlock your doors.  Not only that, it also has a panic button and it opens your trunk. This car has securilock passive anti-theft system.  I am personally learning about this one.

      It has air condition, AM/FM stereo with single CD player, power steering, power breaks, power locks, power windows.

     The trunk has plenty of room and it is great for grocery shopping.  This means it fits all my groceries and for a family of 5 that is a lot
