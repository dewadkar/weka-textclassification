            I saw this vechile for the 1st time about 2 months ago and loved it. It is a great truck for work or play whatever you do. It's got a great interior and it's lasted a long time. That might sound somewhat oxymoronic to you, but the F150 I've got has over 100,000 miles on it because the previous owner drove it over 100 miles everyday. I was a little skeptical about getting the truck but my fears were put to rest. I've had no tune ups on it and it's been a pain free truck.

I love a lot of things about it. There's a lot of great features, including a/c, cruise, with the controls for it on the steering wheel, a front and rear gas tank which is very useful because you can select and switch back and forth which tank you want the gas to come out of(especially if you were going to share the truck with a friend/child/etc.) It's got a pretty comfy interior and overall is just a great truck for anyone who needs a quality vechile for whatever they do.<br><br>
