            I own several Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor packages, a 1994 and a 1998. In my line of work I require a vehicle that will stand up to long, hard days on the road, as well as provide good creature comfort. The Crown Vic does just that. It is a great highway cruiser, and the standard seats, while being far from luxurious, provide good support and are comfortable. These vehicles have been highly reliable and perform every task asked of them without hesitation. The high points of the cars are spaciousness, handling and body and frame integrity. The engine performance is outstanding when you consider this car weighs almost two tons. With the speed rated tires that are standard equipment, and the oversized four wheel disc brakes, the car stops fast and straight. The suspension, when properly maintained, provides a firm ride, adding to the handling of the vehicle. However, it's not as cushy as some like in this big a car. Those desiring a relatively firm ride.  yet wanting some decent handling characteristics would do well to look for a Crown Vic with the handling and performance package, rather than the P71 police package.

The low point is the front end noise that seems to be a Ford trademark on their full size cars. When turning the wheel hard left or right, the front end noise can be considerable. Also, the quality of construction in the 1998 seems lower than in previous years, with the doors sounding a bit hollow rather than the resounding solidity of closing the doors on the 1994.

Comparing this vehicle to the Chevrolet Caprice, which was the last rear wheel drive police package passenger car sold by GM, the Crown Vic compares quite favorably. The Caprice was bigger, and in black and white was affectionately known as &quot;Shamu.&quot; It was faster with the LT-1 engine, but slower with the 5 liter base engine package. I liked the Ford and the Chevy, but if you want a rear wheel drive police package car, Ford is the only one left who makes them.  <br><br>
