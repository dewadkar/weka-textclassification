             I bought my '94 GT for a whopping $3500, and have since then, been wholly satisfied, and pleasantly surprised. Among it's pros, there are 3 main ones that stick out when buying it and while owning it. 
1. Astonishing amounts of power are emitted from this 2.5 Liter V6. Loaded with dual overhead camshafts, that provide 24 valves for the six cylinders, it produces 164 horsepower. Since the car only weighs 2680 (or something close to that),  its acceleration is stunning, going from 0-60 in 7.4 seconds. It's no corvette, but for the price it can hardly be beat, plus modifications are easy to add, making it a very adaptable engine. Whether you're looking for performance or just around-town driving, this car can really zip around and is fun to drive.
2. Handling is one of the things I expected to be good when I bought this car, and it truly is. Since it has front wheel drive, a low center of gravity, and thick racing tires, it can take corners fairly quickly compared to many other cars in its category (specifically those with rear wheel drive). The probe always has a tight feeling when driving it. Its pretty tough to come off the road, slip, or lose control. 
3. And of course the final reason is simply an opinion, but the probe tends to catch eyes with its sleek body. It is both cool and tasteful (not over the top), but I don't really need to get into this pro since you can all see for yourselves what it looks like. Many feature moonroofs, premium sound systems, and retractable antennas.
4. And oh yeah, it gets good gas mileage.
Of the cons, there are 2 main ones. One of them was obvious the second I test drove it, but the other took some time to get on my nerves.
1. As many others have written, the interior (and mainly the rear seats) is pretty small. When there are no back seat passengers, the two front seats are fairly comfortable, providing ample leg room, and mediocre head room. In a standard, however, sometimes the passenger and the center console can get in the way of shifting. Without a passenger, shifting is comfortable. In my '94 probe there are two airbags, lending some assurance to the driver in such a small, quick car. Controls fall easily to hand. The seats themselves are adequate and comfortable, but nothing special, just clothe. And I must admit that the trunk/cargo area is humongous. I'm just not sure why some of that isn't part of the back seats. That much of the interior is fine.The real problem with the interior is the lack of leg and head room in the back seat. This also makes is difficult for people to get in and out of the car since it is so low to the ground, and the two front seats must be moved forward to squeeze in the back seat passengers.  If you are planning to be taking more than one person around frequently, do yourself a favor, save yourself some frustration, and don't buy this car (or any other low, two-door car either)
2. The other problem that became noticeable especially after owning it for a while, was the loud road noise. The faster you go the more you can hear the road, the tires, the wind, and rattles. It's one of the sacrifices you have to make when you buy such an inexpensive car. All of these noises, however, can be bettered with new balanced tires. Part of it, still, just can't be avoided. The fact that it is front-wheel drive is a plus when you consider handling, but when it comes to road noise and comfort it is a villain.
Despite what a few other reviews wrote, I have had few problems with my probe. It has proved reliable and consistent. I've had to replace the distributor, and that's the only thing I've done in a year. Though many of the newer cars these days are boasting horsepower in the 200-300 range regularly, the probe still stands above many of its competitors, including the mitsubishi eclipse, the toyota celica, and the nissan 240sx (in performance), falling behind only the more expensive honda prelude and acura integra (in comfort and reliability). It is a sheep in wolf's clothing, providing incomparable bang for it's buck. It's a great first car for teens or college students. I would probably avoid it if I had a family. All in all, it is a car I enjoy immensely and get comments on frequently. I'll keep it as long as it runs, which from the looks of it could be a while as long as you keep up with basic maintenance.
