            I purchased a 2000 F350 Lariat Crew Cab 4x4 with a 7.3 power stroke three weeks ago.  It was purchased to replace a 1986 F250 Super Cab 4x4 with a 6.9 diesel.  I love the new truck.  The additional power and speed from the 7.3 is great.  The truck is roomy, comfortable big, but handles like a dream.

If you go with this model, you need to understand the it is very long, better that 21 feet from tip to tip.  If you are planning to put it in a garage, make sure it will fit, both length and height.  With the 285 tires that they seem to include as standard on all the lariats, the truck is close to 7 feet tall.

I would strongly recommend that anyone buying the 350 Crew Cab 4x4 go with a diesel.  It is about $4,000 extra, but the power is great, the mileage is alot better than the V10 and if you plan to pull anything, you can't beat the turbo.

The new design of the Super Duty is also a great feature, it is no doubt the best looking pickup on the road today.<br><br>
