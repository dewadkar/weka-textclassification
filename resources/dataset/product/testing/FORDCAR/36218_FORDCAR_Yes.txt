            Enjoy driving around town in this car, so easy to park. I like dash layout, controls within easy reach of driver. Seating is average in comfort, cramped for tall people in back seat. Plenty of trunk space. Gas mileage is the best! I drive steep mountain road daily and the Focus has no problem, pulls it better than a lot of other cars.
Several recalls since introduction. I've had to have mine towed in twice because of battery cable problem and broken transmission linkage. But have had EXCELLENT service from my dealership. Engine noise is distracting at higher speeds, turn that radio on.
