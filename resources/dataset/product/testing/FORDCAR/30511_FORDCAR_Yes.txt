            I had a new 2000 Ford F350 4X4 to use for the last couple of months, and let me tell you, it is a TRUCK.  This was a bare bones truck with one option, an 8 foot Fisher plow.  The power-plant under this beast was the Triton V10, gulping gas at 10mpg.

From the moment you climb up into this beast you know you're ready to work.  The ride of the truck is all work, as the 9900lb springs bounce you over bumps.  The day I brought it home we had 8 inches of snow and you had to temper the throttle in 2 wheel drive.  In 4 wheel drive it handled the snow without a problem.  Dropping the plow to do the driveway was a breeze.  The height of the cab gave a good range of vision while plowing.  

With the plow off it drove nicer, but you are still in a truck.  You can easily spin the tires and get the thing sideways if you are not careful.  The sound of the engine does not give you an indication of the power transfer as you accelerate and you could get caught off-guard.  For a work truck, it does ride fairly nice on the hi-way, cruising at 85mph, with plenty of power to spare.  

If you need a truck for working and hauling, this will do it.  <br><br>
