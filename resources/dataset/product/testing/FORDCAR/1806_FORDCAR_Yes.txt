            Well, the title says it all.  I purchased my <b>1992 4WD Ford Ranger</b> at <b>Woody Anderson Ford</b> in Huntsville, AL in 1993.  At the time, I needed a reliable vehicle that would not leave me stranded on the side of the road, that would haul various educational, construction, and camping equipment over unpredictable terrain in a wilderness treatment center where I was working.  This little <b>Ford ranger 4WD</b> truck was mine all mine for $6,059.  It was used.  Maybe a little overused as I would later find out.

My truck came with a 5 speed transmission, 6 cylinder engine, power steering, brakes, A/C, cruise control, etc...no power windows or door locks. The gas mileage was about 28-30 highway.  But really, with all the off road work this truck found, it's really hard to say, exactly what kind of mileage it got.

 Engaging the 4WD was a bit of a trick to learn, but once I learned exactly how to do it, it was a snap in all conditions.  I just didn't like to get out of the vehicle, maybe in mud or rain and lock in the hubs.   Arrrrrgh...the messes we get into...

Later, after driving a bit, I noticed a clattering noise under the hood.  What could that be I wondered?  Hmmmmm a trip to the mechanic...and I found out that the rocker arm assembly had to be replaced because the return oil sender line was clogged...hmmmm previous owner not changing oil often enough???  I wondered...well, that done to the tune of about $350.00 ... back on the road little red tonka...and on the road it stayed too.  That was the only major repair this truck had to have in the entire time I owned it. I put many miles on this truck, up to 130,000 with no other major problems. Talk about Ford tough!  

Some road stories...This truck brought my husband home from the hospital  (a liver biopsy) on our horrible dirt road.  Okay...I should write a review about the horrors of medical experiments on live human beings, but I won't.  Suffice it to say that he had an outpatient procedure that left him quite helpless for about 2 weeks.  And of course he had to go home right then, it was an outpatient procedure. 

 So into the truck we went.  First of all, the seats are upright pretty much, and that's it, you're stuck. No storage space in the cab or our model. So no way to recline the seats. Whew, the highway was flat and okay...but our road was another story... dirt, potholes, etc...The first bump, and Hi starts to turn pale green.  Out I hopped and locked the hubs down.  I shifted into the high 4WD gear.  That was still too bumpy for him.  Then I shifted into the low 4WD, no bumps could be felt by my hubby.  Now we crept home at the amazing speed of 5mph, but we would never have made it at all in any kind of condition had we not had that feature of this truck. (A horse or walking would have been faster *chuckle*)

Next story...Blizzard/ice storm '94.  I was stuck at my work for 4 days straight without the <b>tonka toy</b>...as it became known to staff and my students. Fortunately, my husband had the <b> little red tonka toy </b> while I was gone.  He really needed it too.  He had to use it to climb over fallen trees and branches in the road, to get groceries for himself and all the neighbors.  Not to mention, kerosene.  The power was out for 14 days.  The phones were out for 21 days.

After a while, the <b> tonka toy </b> got to come back to work.  It was a godsend.  We moved mattresses, tents, sleeping gear, water and construction materials for new tent platforms during the aftermath of ice storm over old logging roads that were either iced over, had fallen trees covering them or were 6"-7" deep in mud.  At times the truck doubled as a tractor for moving fallen trees off the access roads...The wench on the front end that I installed really helped here.  The <b>4WD Ford Ranger</b> never failed!  It never cut out, bogged down, or quit in any of the really awful situations we had it in.  We just figured as long as we had the wench, we could pull it out of any stuck spot we had it in.  So, we just kept pushing it.  

There were a couple of spots that I thought it had reached it's limits, a really steep rock hill that was really muddy toward the base caused the truck to act unstable, and well, at that particular spot, instability was sort of life and death for the occupants of the vehicle.  We just slowed down, and allowed the truck to find her feet.  The key here was allowing the truck to get traction, and having really good mud tires.  

Okay, so all praise and honor to the <b>1992 4WD Ford Ranger</b> right?  No, not really, it's just a truck.  And it's the kind of truck that Ford ought to make.  There were some problems, but not many.  I had the brakes redone, which was really general maintenance. I was faithful about the oil and lube every 3000 miles.  And I had the Universal joints (only in a 4WD there are more and they are called something else) replaced.  And of course at the beginning of my relationship with this truck, there was the one major repair.

The cab was really small, and the only reason I traded this truck was because I had to have a trade in order to trade to a larger vehicle <b>1995 Supercab Ford Ranger</b> read my review please...not nearly the truck this one was.  If I could have kept this truck I would have...I really miss it.
