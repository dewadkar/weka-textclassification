            We bought this car from a friend for $350.  We knew before we bought it that it had a transmission defect.  Many people say to stay away from the Taurus because of this very defect, that it costs $2000 or more to fix it. But, if they did alittle comparison shopping and looking around they would find it was not nearly that much.  We found someone locally who will rebuild the entire transmission for $1000. Yes, that is alot of money, but consider this: ALL the already rebuilt transmissions we were finding costed upwards 1500 plus shipping. If you are willing to put in money for a good car, it's definitely worth it.  This car has plenty of room, it has huge seats and a lot of room in the back.  It's very comfortable, the engine is very quiet and smooth.  Make sure before you buy one of these vehicles that you check the brakes. We put $700 in brakes into this car when we got it, but that was only because it had been sitting around for years.  That might not be the case with every vehicle.    Before you buy one, check to see if the transmission has been rebuilt, if it has then you won't have to get it rebuilt! Keep in mind though, if it has been rebuilt, the car will be more expensive. If it is expensive and it hasn't been rebuilt, don't even consider it. In any case, this is a great car, as I said before very quiet, smooth, and roomy.
