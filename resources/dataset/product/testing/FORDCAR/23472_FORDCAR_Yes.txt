            While perusing the local Ford dealership, I took a look at this new Ford Taurus.  Now, you'll see by my previous review of a '95 model that I am generally not impressed with the Taurus.  However, the 2000 model looked deserving of a drive, so I took it for a spin.

The vehicle I tested has the optional DOHC V6, mated to a standard automatic transmission with overdrive.  Now the Taurus is not known for spirited acceleration or great handling.  However, I was very impressed when I put my foot into this engine and got a surprising snap to attention.  This car pulls with surprising authority, and that V6, while dead quiet at idle, really sings at full power.  The handling of the vehicle, while not sports-car firm, is adequate for a point-A to point-B sedan.  There's some dive and roll in braking and hard turns, but it is kept to a reasonable level, keeping the handling rather sharp for a family sedan.  The steering wheel felt great in my hands, and the variable-assist steering was well-weighted, giving me more boost at low speeds, and less at higher speeds.  The transmission is fairly good, but does hunt slightly at part-throttle, but generally performs well at cruising speeds, shifting smoothly.

The interior was quite pleasant.  The guages were well-placed and easy to read, and the power driver's seat made it easy to get comfortable.  Though I prefer a manual seat, the power feature was not hard to use.  The car came with an AM/FM stereo with CD and cassette in the head unit.  The stereo is typically modern Ford.  It provides good sound at low volumes, but is remarkably free of distortion at even moderate to high volume.  This isn't a thumper, though, and lacks really strong high-end power.

Interior room was plentiful all around, with lots of head and legroom both front and back.  The seats are reasonably comfortable, but like the Focus, I wouldn't wanna be there for long.  The center console folds out rather uniquely, providing space for a few cupholders, some change, and a few CDs.  It's a handy feature that can be easily hidden.

Trunk space is downright cavernous.  There's more than enough room to stuff your stuff, whatever it might be.  The car also has a split-folding rear seat, giving you even more room if necessary.  However, a space-saver spare tire sits under the trunk floor, as a silly cop-out for a little bit more space.

The exterior of the car is nothing to write home about.  While not nearly as ugly as the '96-99 models, it's not very attractive, either.  It's much more conservative, and the car actually looks a little handsome.  As I said, while not drop-dead gorgeous, it's nowhere near as hideous as the previous model.

So what do I think of this car?  I'm glad you asked that.  While the interior could use some work, and the styling is a little bland, this would be a very good car for someone who's just looking for a solid daily driver to take to the office, or tote the family around on short trips and such.  The engine is strong, the interior is roomy, and the radio is well-designed.  This Ford did something that most Fords can't.  It impressed me.
