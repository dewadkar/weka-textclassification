            I own a 1995 Ford Probe GT24v, that I bought used, by one owner, early 2000.  I was attracted to this car because of its sporty look and its fast engine.  I could not turn down the offer I got on it.  It is glossy purple with custom probe wheels.  The design on the GT24v is different compared to regular Probe GT's.  The back panel by the rear license plate has a unique GT design where the license plate would be on a regular GT.  I think it stands out a lot more than the average Ford Probe GT.  It is very sporty and also very speed.The tires are wider than the Ford Probe SE.  Which creates a smoother ride and better handling. Be sure you get a standard, I could not imagine driving a car like this in an automatic.  It would take the fun out of it.
It does not ride more than four comfortably.  The front seats are very spacious and roomy.  Although, the back seats are not as pleasurable.  You normally end up strattling the seats.  It has a large trunk that is ideal for trips.  I recommend getting the car fully loaded.  The premium items are well-worth your money.  For example: A cd player, rear window wiper, electric seat adjustment, cruise control, fog lights, etc.
The car will treat you right if you treat it right.  If you can't expect to drive it to death, and nothing to happen.  After about 60,000 miles the rear calipers will need changed.  The car loves to eat up those brakes.  But you shouldn't experience any problems as long as you know the cars prior history and you treat it good.
I highly recommend that you buy this car.  It is well worth the money, and you will enjoy driving it.  Give it a good look next time you are shopping for a car.<br><br>
