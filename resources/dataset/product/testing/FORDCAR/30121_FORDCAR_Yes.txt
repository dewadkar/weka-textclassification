            As the title says, I work at the Ford Plant building light pickup trucks.  I have worked there for 25 years and the metamorphosis of attitude is phenomenal.  When I first went to work there the motto was "if is rolls it's sold" but now we hear "quality, customer satisfaction, employee involvement" instead.  And you can believe that when they say that "quality is job one", they mean it.
I drive a new truck home each day and fill out a 3 page form on it at the end of the day giving any and all defects that I have found.  Years ago, that was easy but now it's a challenge.
The new colors are great and the difference in the ride due to the frame change (we used to have an "I" beam frame but now we have an "A" frame)is beyond compare.  That won't mean much to anyone unless you are a hard core auto enthusiast but it sure makes a difference when they are aligning your front end.  The ride is as good as most cars and better than some.
The durability of the engine and the robustness of the air-conditioner have to be seen to be believed.  Everyone years ago used to think of 100,000 miles as the life of an engine but that is in the past.  Now there is no limit.
My husband loves his truck and so does everyone we know that has one.  My cousin has driven the other brand for years but has now come over to the good side so that she doesn't have to listen to the rust late at night.HAHA
I would recommend this for anyone that needs a truck, even if you don't think you do, test drive one and you will.  The best part is that more and more women are driving Ford pickups because of the built in luxury and ease of handling that is now built into each product.
