            Back in 1989 I burned through two Ford Escorts in a little over 2 years. The Escorts had problems that required a lot of adjustments - granted I was in my late teens/early twenties but I did take good care of them. When the 2nd died I vowed to stay away from Ford altogether. 

When it came time to trade up my Jeep Cherokee Sport, I tried all the major SUVs and Ford won me back with the Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer Edition. The ride, the interior &amp; extras got me.

The Explorer has a very nice ride - almost car like. The only time you feel like you are in a big SUV is when you try to get a fast start - it is a bit sluggish getting started (I do have the towing package so this contributes to this) however once you get going the acceleration is car-like and very powerful. 

The leather interior on the EB edition is very comfortable and luxurious. There is plenty of room in all seats in most positions. The front seats can be adjusted in many different directions and include lumbar support. The MACH radio system (with 6-disc CD changer) has a very good sound although a little &quot;bass-y&quot; at times. All the other controls are fairly intuitive. My only beef with it is that it has a &quot;monitoring&quot; computer which gives you Miles per Gallon, Miles left, Oil Life %, etc., but this sometimes can give very wacky results - that even a reset sometimes doesn't cure. Where can I download a patch??? :) Usually filing up the gas tank cures this. The dash itself seems a bit out-of-place in the interior of the EB edition. I would think it would be more flashy and have some more electronics in place - but it is quite plain - cheap looking. Not a major problem just something I noticed when comparing to the Jeep Cherokee Limited, Honda Passport, etc.

The trim-line on the EB Edition is very impressive. I'm not 100% sure what is standard in the trim, but it was what won me over. Some things I got with mine: power sunroof, power windows - locks, remote keyless entry and keypad entry, 6-CD changer, leather interior, cargo cover, floor mats, compass/temp overhead gauge, seat heaters, CD/Cassetee/AM-FM in dash (yes that makes a 7-CD compatible systems), rear controls for fan and radio, automatic climate control system, steering wheel controls for radio, climate and speed control, auto-dimming mirror. Outside: running boards, puddle lights, and roof rack.

All-in-all after almost 3500 miles, I am very happy thusfar with my purchase and would recommend it for anyone looking to buy a gas guzzling SUV! :)<br><br>
