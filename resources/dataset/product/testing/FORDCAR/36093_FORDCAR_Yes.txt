            I cannot express in an email the depth to which I enjoy my Focus.  I have owned my ZX3 for a bit over 2 months, and still find little touches that I like.  For the price, I don't think anything else on the market can even compare.  For under $14,000 (carorder.com) I got it almost fully loaded, 4-wheel ABS, Side Airbags, Remote Keyless Entry, and Air Conditioning.  Power Windows were not yet available back in January, but that is the only option (aside from sunroof) that I would have wanted.  

The car drives and handles like an absolute dream, but then I have a manual.  The engine seems plenty powerful with manual, but with automatic I imagine it would feel a bit underpowered.  I get to drive a windy bit of road on my commute, and am very excited when no one is in front of me.  The mileage is outstanding.  I get about 27-28 mpg on a regular basis with a combined city-highway commute, and 31-32 on extended highway trips.

There are so many nice features:

  1)  The dome light:  It turns on when the engine is turned off and stays on until you lock the doors.  It turns on when you unlock doors and stays on until engine is on.  And when the light turns off, it actually fades out, really cool.

2)  The radio:  Being able to use the radio while the engine is off and without any keys.  If you hit the power button on the radio while the keys are out of the ignition, you get 1 hour of play time.

3)  Head room and overall spacious interior:  This car FEELS like a mid-size.  Even backseat passengers in the 3-door hatch are surprised.

4)  The gear shifter:  On the manual, there is a collar on the shifter that you have to lift up in order to put the car in reverse, so no accidental slips into reverse while in forward motion.

5)  The seats:  The seats are some of the most supportive and comfortable I have ever been in.

6)  The perspective:  When passing a Honda CRV, I am at eye-level with that driver, meaning I am heads above most of the other drivers on the road (except those damn monster SUV drivers).

7)  The headlights:  Never going to run my batteries down again.  The main headlights only turn on if the engine is running. 

8)  Passenger controls and gauges:  This car was so well thought out, everything seems to fit my hands.

9)  Overall Exterior Styling:  Two months of ownership and I still thing this is a beautiful car.

10)  Overall fit-and-finish is far above what I would have expected for a Ford.  

There are a couple of things that could be improved:

1)  The levers for the rear seats are confusing for most and don't allow the seat to fold over and slide forward like in most automobiles.  But that is mostly an issue for passengers, not me, the driver!

2)  Daytime running lights would have been nice.

3)  More speed settings on the variable wipers.

I really love my new car, and can't recommend it highly enough!<br><br>
