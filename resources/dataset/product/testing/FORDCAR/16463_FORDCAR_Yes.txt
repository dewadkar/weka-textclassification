            I bought my truck used in 1996.  It was a program vehicle.  I have used it everyday since then and have found it to be the very best vehicle I have ever owned.  This is top priority for a woman in her 50's.  We have to have a dependabel vehicle.  My 1996 Ford Ranger XLT 2.3 can do more than I ever imagined a light truck could do.  See, I us it for everything since I live out in the country.  If you are out there looking for a good truck this is the one to buy.  Of course you have to realize maintence is important though, with any vehicle.  I have put more than 80,000 miles on my truck and the only things I've had to replace is the battery, other than changing my oil every 3,000 miles.    <br><br>
