            After driving around the Explorer that my parents own, I decided that I myself wouldn't mind checking into one of the newer model Fords...  Being that I liked the Explorer already, I figured that I might as well test drive one of the 2002 models and see what it's like.  It comes in 4 different models, the Eddie Bauer, the Limited, the XLS, and XLT.  


<b>XLS ($24,020) </b>
Comes with cloth upholstery, a high level of standard equipment, and a five-speed manual transmission. Ford's new five-speed automatic transmission ($1095) is optional. Four-wheel drive adds $1800. XLS does not offer some of the high-zoot options available on the other models, including the V8. 

<b>XLT ($27,780)</b>
Gets nicer sport cloth upholstery, a six-way power driver's seat, body-colored exterior trim, a CD stereo instead of cassette, and more interior features, such as a temperature gauge and compass, map lights and dome lights, outside approach lighting, extra power outlets, illuminated keypad for keyless entry. The new five-speed automatic transmission is standard, and aluminum alloy wheels replace steel wheels. Four-wheel drive adds $1965. Leather upholstery with a six-way power driver's seat is available for $655. 

<b>Limited/Eddie Bauer($34,055)</b>
Come with leather seating surfaces, automatic dual-zone climate control, a 290-watt six-CD stereo with six speakers, adjustable power pedals, fog lights, and wider tires. Six-way adjustable heated power seats with dual manual lumbar supports are used in front, and the driver's seat has a three-position memory feature. Four-wheel drive adds $1965. 


<b>Design/Style</b>

Overall, the car is very aestetically pleasing, with a very smooth design.  They stuck with the old styling rather than trying to upgrade and messing up the popular styling needlessly.

Inside, the car was equipped with leather interior, however, you can have cloth as well...  The Eddie Bauer and Limited packages come with the leather interior, while the XLS and XLT come with cloth standard.

I definitely like the wood trimming on the inside of the vehicle, which definitely accentuates the interior colors.  They have also increased the size of the seats in order to accomodate the larger people that live in Detroit (the nation's fattest city... which just so happens to be motor city... what a coincidence...)  They also added in adjustable pedals.

The seats are now heated, but only on the Eddie Bauer packages.  These heaters are much better than the stanard ones of the past... they actually work.  :)

You can also add on items such as a powered moonroof, a third row of seating, auxiliary air conditioning, running boards, and a tow package amongst other options.


<b>Performance, Power, and Manueverability</b>

This is definitely not the beast of an SUV that my parents have...  The engine is no longer available in the V-8, not even on the Eddie Bauer... the V-6 however, is now standard on all models, even the lower ones...  Which is great news for those that don't have a lot to spend...  Unfortunately, those that are looking to spend more for a better engine, just sort of get screwed over in the deal, much like myself.

The engine, even though it isn't as powerful as the past engines, the vehicle is slightly lighter, the design is a little smoother, and the overall workings of the vehicle are a little bit better, so that definitely makes the car that much faster.

Unfortunately, even though they redefined a lot of the issues with the speed and with the weight of the vehicle, they still haven't done all that much with it's ability to handle the corners.  The explorer is still one big beast of a machine and is nearly impossible to manuever with 100%...  I understand that it is an SUV and isn't meant for manuevering, but it still is a little more sluggish than the competition.

Another unfortunate issue is the overall ability to see when you are trying to change lanes...  There's a massive blind spot, no matter what you do.  They have placed the supports for the vehicle in the worst possible places, as those are the hardest places to see in the first place, and that's where the biggest blind spots are now...  So, changing lanes, can be quite the task, unless you look out your window to make sure that you're okay.  I've already seen a few accidents because of this problem in my own local area... Side swipes seem to be a much bigger issue with the Explorer than most other vehicles.


<b>Overall</b>

Overall, the Explorer has made some improvements, but it is still a long way from perfection.  The feel of the vehicle is a whole lot better, including the additional legroom and seatroom.  All of those features are just great, unfortunately they sacrificed a lot of the power that the Explorer was known for in order to add in these features without adding more to the pricetag.
