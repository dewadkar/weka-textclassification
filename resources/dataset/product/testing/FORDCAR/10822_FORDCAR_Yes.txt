            I bought the Ford Windstar because of the growing size of my family and because i coach a little league baseball team and needed the extra room for players without rides. The Ford Windstar is rather unique due to the fact most mini-vans today look very much alike however the Windstar seems to have found a way to stand out in a crowd. I like the fact that the Windstar comes with an overhead storage area where other mini-vans tend to make you scatter your belongings out around the vehicle allowing them to slide around and make a mess. The Windstar also comes with a center console storage area which makes a terrific place to store cds and  tapes or road maps. The roomyness is unequaled by any other mini-van. Before my wife and i bought the vehicle we looked at the Dodge Caravan which is also a great van however at the time only came with a 4 cylinder engine and didn't come with storage areas like the Windstar, however it did come with a fishnet type basket between the driver and passenger seat which kept dropping things as i hit the brakes (might as well not have anything there at all). The only thing not to like about the Windstar is gas mileage it gets approximately 20 in the city and 26-28 highway, but as anyone with a larger vehicle will tell you thats not half bad! Driving the Windstar is like riding a magic carpet, in the fact you don't have engine noise and it tends to hug the road and provide one of the smoothest rides possible from any large vehicle. I also feel safer in the Windstar than in my last vehicle (dodge neon), due to the fact it has reinforced siding and antilock brakes which has saved my children and i numerous times driving in the city. Families with one or more children should concider buying this vehicle because smaller cars will not allow you to take your family and friends in one trip. If you are single i wouldn't want a family car and wouldn't concider buying it.         <br><br>
