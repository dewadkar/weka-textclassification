            My husband wanted a 4-door Ford F350 in 1992, so we ordered it because we couldn't find such an animal on any lot without the dual rear axle.  It's big and powerful.  We get about 12mpg.  Not so great on gas conservation, but worth it if you need the extra space.  We have traveled with our children to South Dakota, Arizona, and Montana and back in it, pulling our 25' 5th wheel trailer.  We find it comfortable.  It's a tuff truck.  

My husband is not a sexist man and believes that we all need to be able to handle the pick up, even with the trailer.  My 16 year old daughter and myself are able to drive both the pick up alone and with the trailer.  This is really nice, we can travel further each day because not only one person is driving.  My husband is a truck driver....he doesn't want to drive all day on his vacation!!  You obviously have to be careful when going around a corner, it doesn't corner like a sports car, but WOMEN CAN DO IT!! 

One thing I don't like, and I hope they have fixed since we bought ours, is that &quot;electric windows&quot; didn't mean on all four doors, just the two front doors....&quot;it doesn't come that way&quot;.  I couldn't believe it, we ordered the electric windows so we could adjust the back windows, not the front!!
