            With the news of a baby on the way, I knew I would have to trade in my 2-door sports car for a family car.  The thought of a &quot;family car&quot; was enough to throw me into a bout of morning sickness!  I couldn't picture myself driving a mini-van around town.  We needed a vehicle with four doors, a roomy interior, low maintenance, safety features, and a big trunk.  We found those features and more in the Ford Taurus.

We bought a used 1992 Ford Taurus that was in very good condition.  I was very pleased with it the first time I drove it.  I was most impressed with how smooth it drove.  The Taurus steered, accelerated, and braked with comfort and ease.  The interior was very nice and roomy.  The features on the dash were easy to read and simple to use.  This was important to me, because I hate fishing around for the wiper switch as I'm driving down the road, while the windshield is pelted with rain. 

The seats adjust easily, and there is plenty of leg room in both the front and back seats.  The driver side is equipped with an airbag.  One of my favorite things about our Taurus is the size of the trunk.  This comes in very handy when I have to load up my son's stroller, portable crib, diaper bags, toys, etc!

I sometimes think of our Taurus as a family car in disguise, because I don't feel like that's what I'm driving.  We gave our Taurus a makeover:  new paint job, tinted windows, and sporty rims and tires.  This has made quite a difference!  It gave our Taurus a whole new feel, and I enjoy driving it much more now.

I recommend the Ford Taurus to someone looking for a comfortable, spacious family car that is sporty and affordable.<br><br>
