            Building a car in essentially the same form in several different countries strikes some as simply another cost-cutting gambit. But Ford's new Focus shows that a world car can accomplish far more.
Designed in Europe, where crowded roads and pricey gasoline ensure that compact cars serve as mainstream family transportation, the Focus is vastly more refined than American compacts that occupy the bottom of the automotive food chain. It offers a twin-cam 16-valve, 2.0-liter engine. Its interior is warm and inviting, owing to a good choice of tasteful cloth upholstery and plastic panels that are finished in plush-feeling paint. And with a tall profile and clever packaging, the space inside the Focus is impressively generous for a car of this size.
But what is impressesive about the Focus are its finely honed moves. Its suspension is sure-footed under all conditions. Its steering, shifter, and brakes feel linear and accurate. And every system feels a part of a carefully developed whole.
Generaly, the car is a bit too small for the American market but if you like small compact car with economic fuel usage this car is for you.<br><br>
