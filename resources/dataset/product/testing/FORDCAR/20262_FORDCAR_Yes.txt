                 I have a 98 Ford Ranger that is a company truck.  I have some pros and cons about this type of vehicle and I would like to share them with you.
     My Ranger is a light blue Ford Ranger XLT with an extended cab.  What I like about this vehicle is the style and design of the vehicle.  The extended cab is a wonderful option for this truck, it gives the feel of being in a more open space and allowing one to store more things in the back. 
     The design of the Ranger XLT is very sleek and I love how the front of the vehicle is slightly sloped for better aerodynamics.  The wheels have a great design to give the Ranger a more sporty look that allows me to have a more &quot;modern&quot; styled vehicle. This is what like about the Ford Ranger.
     Though I have likes for this vehicle there are some dislikes.  This truck has a very ugly pin stripe that is considered &quot;denim&quot;.  The engine power is not as quite desirable in a sporty truck.  This V-6 engine has very little torque and has trouble getting up to speed.  
     Another dislike about my Ranger is the recall on the cruise control and how it can &quot;stick&quot; while driving which can keep the truck from stopping efficiently.    <br><br>
