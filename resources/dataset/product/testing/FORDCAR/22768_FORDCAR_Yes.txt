            I fell in love with the look of the Ford Explorers back when they first came out.  I bought a brand new 2 wheel drive, 4 door, XLT for $21,000 back in 1993.  I still own and love it.  I feel safe and secure while driving it.  I have just reached 140,000 miles.  I have replaced the transmission and the whole break/rotor/caliper system and now it is just like new again.  I have thought about trading it in and buying something new, but I just don't know if I could find another vehicle that I love as much for the same price.  I would recommend it to anyone.  <br><br>
