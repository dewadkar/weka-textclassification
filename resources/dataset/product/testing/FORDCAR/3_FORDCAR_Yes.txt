                 We bought our Taurus during the Memorial day sale at our local Ford dealer.  We were expecting our first child and felt we needed more cargo room than our current sedan (a 1994 Grand Am) allowed.  We also have two dogs that are like our children, so they go everywhere.  The Taurus has the obvious station wagon room plus the roof top rack that can hold 100 lbs of &quot;stuff&quot;.  This allows room for all the baby things and the dogs, too.  
     We started looking at other Pontiacs because we liked the Grand Am alot but we also felt like we owed it to ourselves to look at Fords because we knew we could get the 6 cylinder engine we wanted plus Ford usually has a good financing deal.  We got 3.9% on this car.  The Taurus came in below the cost on the Pontiacs and with the 3.9 financing, we had the deal we could afford.  I forgot to mention, I am basically a loyal Ford owner.  I have had other Ford cars and they ran forever and started every time no matter how cold it was.
     We did not want a Mini-Van for many reasons.  High profile in the wind, everybody has one, they drove like busses (felt like it, anyway) and  it seems like the Mini-Van drivers think they own the road because they are driving &quot;child haulers&quot;...remember the baby on board signs?  We didn't want to be &quot;one of them.&quot;
     LIKES:
more interior room than a sedan
roof rack
comes with nice &quot;extras&quot;; arm rest, tape player, automatic headlights,       split-fold rear seat, strong enough engine not to bog down in the       mountains, remote keyless locks, rear window defrost and wiper, 3rd 
      rear seat
fairly flat back seat was easy to fit and install an infant car seat
good rear leg room
3.9% financing
drives nicely for a station wagon
interval wipers
can shift out of overdrive for extra pick up when entering traffic
     DISLIKES:
rear fold seat doesn't work if the baby's car seat is in the middle.
did not come with fog lights
doesn't handle like the Mustang
did not come with running light headlights
rear window cannot be opened without the key
rear window/door opens &quot;up&quot;, window does not slide down into door and door 
     cannot be opened flat like the old Country Squire
