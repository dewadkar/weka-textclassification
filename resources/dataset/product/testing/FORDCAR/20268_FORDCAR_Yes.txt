            Not with mine!  I have a 1998 Ford Ranger and haven't had a bit of trouble with it.  In fact, I've been so pleased with it that I would definitely buy another one.

Before buying this truck, I put forth the effort to test drive all of the small trucks on the market.  I chose the Ford because it was the quietest and roomiest inside.  The Dodge Dakota's interior was not put together well while the Chevy, Toyota, and Nissan were all too small and noisy.

The Ford has plenty of power for normal driving conditions and I've even towed our small camp trailer with it, though it had to work pretty hard to do it.  You could easily tow a boat or small camp trailer with the Ranger, but be ready to use a lot more fuel.

The other problem with the Ranger is the air-conditioner.  When it's running, you notice a pretty substantial drop in power.  In fact, you can feel it turn on and off while you're driving down the road.  This is with the 3.0L V6.

Other than that, I've been extremely pleased with this vehicle.  It's very comfortable and easy to drive.  It has 40,000 miles on it now and is still in perfect shape.  I feel very confident that I could rely on it any time I need it.<br><br>
