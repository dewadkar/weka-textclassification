            I had a Focus as a rental car on a business trip to Boston for a few days and really liked it a lot. Not quite as much as my '99 Mazda Protege, but I bet I could buy a Focus for less than a Protege, given the huge number of Ford dealers.

I've also had a Dodge Neon as a rental car, about a year ago. Nice also, but I thought the Focus was a little more fun to drive. The Focus, Neon and Protege are all surprisingly roomy.

The Neon's automatic transmission is only three speeds; I didn't notice that as a problem, but it seems a little dated. I think (and you may want to confirm this) the Focus and the Protege have four-speed automatic transmissions. Manual transmissions on all of these models would probably provide more pep.

The Mazda Protege also has a center-rear shoulder belt, an important safety feature for parents like me. The Neon I had lacked this feature, and I can't remember if the Ford has that feature. If that feature is important to you, make sure to look for it. It has to be designed as part of the car, so you can't add this safety feature later. The Protege, Chevy Prizm/Toyota Corolla, and VW Jetta all have this safety feature; not sure about other small cars.

The week after my first Boston trip, where I'd had the Focus, I returned to Boston. On this second trip, I had a rental Chevy Cavalier. In comparison to the Focus, the Cavalier is dated and mediocre. The Cavalier's automatic transmission (like the Focus, it's mounted between the front seats) isn't even lighted, so you can't even look at the Cavalier's transmission lever and know what gear you're in. If I were looking to buy a car, I wouldn't bother with the Cavalier--the Focus makes the Cavalier seem ancient. Assuming the Cavalier's still available, it's not in the same league as the Focus or any of the small cars I've mentioned here. If you somehow have to a Chevy badge, go for the Chevy Prizm, twin to the Toyota Corolla.

Of all the cars mentioned here, I think only the Focus has a station-wagon version, so that may be important to some readers. There's a Saturn station wagon too, but I've never driven a Saturn and when I was shopping last year, at least then no Saturns had the center-rear shoulder belt, so I never considered the Saturns. Actually, the Dodge Neon is available as a wagon, sort of, as the Chrysler PT Cruiser, a retro-wagon built on the Neon's chassis.

The only question mark for me about the Focus is reliability. It'll be interesting to see what owners have to say about that in the 4/2001 &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine auto issue. By then, I think enough CR readers will have bought the Focus and had time to measure reliability.

By the way, CR hasn't done a full test of the Focus yet, but in a very brief (a few paragraphs) report recently, CR found the Focus promising. Now if it can only turn out to be as reliable as its Japanese-designed competitors... <br><br>
