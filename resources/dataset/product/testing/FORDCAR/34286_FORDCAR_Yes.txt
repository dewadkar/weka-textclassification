            I have a 1998 Ford F150 Triton V8 and I love it!  It has the third door on it an that if very helpful on getting our daughter in and out of the truck.  Of course they came out with the four doors the next year, but oh well!

I got it on a lease and it will be up in March of 2001.  I will be sad to see it go, but I will more than likely trade it in on a brand new one.

This truck handles wonderfully and it has a lot of power.  If you need to get onto the freeway fast, this truck can do it!  You may think that with a V8 it gets pretty poor gas mileage, but it doesn't!  I get about 18 to 20 miles to the gallon, and that's pretty good for a V8! 

It has the whole towing package, so when we go to the lake with our boat, all we have to do is back it up and hook the boat up!  It tows great as well.

If you are in the market for a new vehicle and you need a truck for what ever reason, I recommend that you get one of these.  It's big enough for the whole family and it also gets the job done!<br><br>
