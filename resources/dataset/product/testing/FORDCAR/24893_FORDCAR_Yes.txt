            Old, or young this car's for you, as long as rear drive is what you want.  I personally have a Mustang GT, and it does exactly what I want it to do.  The exhaust allows everyone to know who's coming down the road.  The sound system is immaculate, a Mach 460 system, which gives off exactly what you want to hear.  Up front, everyone's comfortable, and honestly, as for the back, a bit too tight.  Darn, one flaw, but not too bad, don't let this discourage you, because the only thing I use the back seats are to throw my gym bag to!!  I bought the car for my preferences, and my comfort.  To approximate, I'd say anyone under 5'10 would be more than comfortable to sit in the back, and for a two door, it's to be expected.  Standard, wide 17 inch wheels on the GT is what keep all the eyes on it!
