            We purchased a 99 Windstar earlier this year. We bought it as a replacement for our previous minivan...a 1996 Ford Windstar. I was one of those moms who hated the idea of a minivan, hated the size, hated the image it evoked. However, once i drove my van, I had to admit I loved it. Why a minivan? Convenience, comfort, and safety were the keys. Why a Windstar? the safety record was impressive, when we drove it, it handled like a car, it was easy to drive, and responded well. When we went to buy a new one, i honestly didn't look at anything but another Windstar. I love the design of the windstar, we never had any problems with it other than the door molding coming off, and the brakes needed replacing once. Brakes are a consumable item, I expect that. Our new 99 Windstar has the dual sliding doors, although not the automatic ones. I love the sliding doors on both sides. Its very convenient when dealing with 2 older kids and one in a carseat. I like the fact that the bench seat in our Windstar can be placed to either side of the car. That makes only one side accessible from the third row bench, but that works well for us. We can change which side our kids get out on, and it allows us to know where they are, and have them get out on the same side of the car I do, so I know they aren't going out into traffic etc. Having the sliding door on the other side allows me to put the baby in and out without having to get half into the van and on my knees..so its a great convenience! We travel a lot, and the Windstar has more than enough room for our family of five plus all of our gear. The dual air zones are great too. Overall, I have been extremely happy with the Windstar minivan. It looks good, it drives well, and has that added advantage of being able to separate small people so you don't have to hear &quot;she's touching me!!&quot;. Everyone has their own space, and everyone gets a window seat!
