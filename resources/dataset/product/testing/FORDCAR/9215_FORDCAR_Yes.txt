            A regrettable side effect of the rising costs of buying and owning a vehicle is that it's no longer economically feasible to keep around a "beater" for special occasions. Where many of my neighbors once kept a rattletrap pickup on hand for their monthly trips to the landfill, they've now sold them to be able to afford their deluxe SUVs with leather and DVD players. I can see why - the cost of insurance and licensing alone for my rarely-used '88 Toyota pickup truck is running around fifty cents per mile, and that excludes gas and maintenance! 

Auto manufacturers - not a group that's prone to miss the obvious - offer up several potential solutions attempting to merge family vehicle and utility vehicle in a single package. Presumably the early SUVs were designed with a modicum of utility in mind - that's what the <b>U</b> stands for, after all, though few (if any) get such treatment these days. More recently, combining a full or nearly full-sized passenger compartment with a pickup truck bed is all the rage. Quad-cab pickups are by no means a new development - the big ones have been a mainstay of construction and government fleets for years, not to mention fairly popular in Texas (they are <i>quite</i> large, after all). But those trucks, which comfortably hold six adults and a ton or so of equipment, are typically too large for the average suburban garage and too expensive for Joe Sixpack. Enter the quad-cab compact pickup.

Where the compact king-cab pickup's rear "seats" proved laughably small and chronically uncomfortable, a quad-cab boasts rear seating that's similar in size to that of the smaller sedans. Interior shoulder room for these trucks is generally 54 to 58 inches, which is comparable to the width of a Toyota Camry (56.5 inches) or Honda Accord (55 inches). Leg room, however, suffers - only the largest of the class offers as much front-to-back seat room in the rear as the Honda Civic's and Dodge Neon's 28.5 inches of space. Clearly, those rear seats - although roomy relative to the cramped rear space in an extended cab pickup - are not designed for grownups.  

In keeping with this "neither fish nor fowl" theme, the cargo capacity of the quad-cabs also suffers in the bargain: since there's been no lengthening of the frame, additional room in the cab must be chopped off of the cargo bed of the truck. Where compact pickups have traditionally had six- to seven-foot beds, their quad-cab versions lose from one to one-half and two feet. Manufacturers have attempted to disguise this loss of capacity with "bed extenders" - anodized aluminum cages that frame the opened tailgate - but these are no substitute for an enclosed compartment that can be covered and, if need be, locked. 

Ford, whose full-sized F150 is (according to their website) the most popular pickup on the face of the earth, was quick to jump into the compact quad-cab market where their Explorer Sport Trac goes head-to-head against the Chevrolet S-10, Dodge Dakota, Nissan Frontier, and <a href="/content_81182887556">Toyota Tacoma</a>. Though called an "Explorer" - apparently to capitalize on the popularity of Ford's mid-sized SUV - the truck is in actuality an overblown Ford Ranger, the platform upon which early Explorers were built. I've had a couple of chances to drive this vehicle recently, and here's my take:


<b>Look At Me!</b>

From the outside the Sport Trac's close kinship to the previous generation of Explorers is unmistakable: Ford merely cut the body off immediately behind the C-Pillar and substituted a cargo box for the enclosed rear end of the SUV version. The oval motif that appears so frequently in Ford design is evident here, as the rear wall of the cab and the leading edge of the cargo box form smooth, concentric curves. A continuous strip of black cladding appears to connect cab and bed at the rocker panel level; it's colinear with the black-clad front and rear bumpers. All trim levels come with black rails permanently installed on the roof and a black composite bed liner that wraps over the edge of the cargo box to form a second black accent strip.  Heavy-duty tie-downs (three per side) are installed within that strip on the bed's exterior wall; another pair of tie-downs are located inside the box.

Interior-wise, the Sport Trac is less interesting: broad expanses of featureless plastic and short-nap fabric dominate, with a monotonous black-and-gray-on-black color scheme. Switches and knobs for the sound system and climate control are located high on the dashboard within fairly easy reach. I thought that the sound system in particular is poorly designed, with too much wasted space and too-small controls. At least on the models I've driven, the Sport Trac's stock sound system is the usual Ford design, with separate toggles for bass/treble, fade, and balance - for my money, a waste of real estate.

The instrument panel - an attractive white face with black printing and red needles - is  nicely laid out in a linear format, with the major gauges designed in an "overlapping" pattern: the tachometer dial covers about 150 degrees of arc, and appears as though it's behind the arc of the speedometer. Fuel, ammeter, and temperature gauges are out at the ends, with the various idiot - errr, indicator - lights arrayed across the top and bottom of the cluster. The stock five-speed automatic transmission is column-mounted, as are controls for the headlights and wiper-washer system. Switches for the optional cruise control are mounted within the circumference of the steering wheel instead of on a stalk.

The rear bench seat is almost completely flat - and it also folds flat along a 60-40 split that both provides interior cargo space and access to storage for the jack and tools. The seat back, which becomes the "floor" of this additional space, is carpeted. As long as we're talking about the rear, though, a welcome innovation for the Sport Trac's is a powered rear window: no longer do you need to install a slider, now you can "crack" the back window at the touch of a button on the dash. Twist that same button and the window automatically retracts fully. Good ventilation, though my dogs'd be through that window in a couple of milliseconds.


<b>Driving Like Crazy</b>

The old joke says that Ford would sell you a Model T in any color you wanted, as long as you wanted black. The same goes for the power plant in the Explorer Sport Trac - you can get any engine you want, as long as it's a 4-liter V6. The good news is that Ford's SOHC mill generates 210 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque (at 5200 and 3000 RPM, respectively). Combine that with responsive, more than adequate acceleration and power for those freeway merges, and you'll quite probably come to like the V6. You'll like it, that is, as long as you don't have to pay to keep it running: although the EPA estimates that you'll get 20 MPG highway, it also estimates that you'll be pouring another gallon of unleaded into your tank for every 10 miles of city driving. Of course, should you opt for the Dodge Dakota quad-cab you'd get even worse mileage (8/20 city/highway), likewise Nissan's quad-cab Frontier (9/19); in contrast, Toyota's Tacoma quad-cab is slightly less thirsty (12/22). Kinda reminds you of an Excursion, no?

Also on the down side of the engine is a coarse sound and feel - compared to V6s available from other manufacturers, Ford's is noisy and rough running. This is especially noticeable when the engine is pushed by hard acceleration. Since Ford's engineers apparently didn't see fit to boost sound insulation in the firewall area, the level of engine noise in the cabin is somewhat intrusive. And while on the subject, wind noise is also rather intrusive, so much so that when I first drove the Sport Trac I thought that one of the rear windows was partially open. 

Sitting behind the wheel, you're at a height comparable to that of driving the <i>real</i> Explorer. Oddly, it makes no difference whether you're in a 2WD model or have opted for the part-time 4WD version of the truck - the two versions are the same height and have the same ground clearance. In a town dominated by large vehicles, this seating position doesn't give you much advantage. Sight lines, though, are clear in all directions.

Pushing this hunk of iron around on the freeway is relatively comfortable. Like most compact trucks, the ride is jittery on rough pavement - perhaps slightly less so in this case because of the quad cab's additional weight. While front-to-back motion is normal, I was taken aback by a pronounced rocking sensation on uneven roads - this bodes ill for the Sport Trac's offroad capabilities (which are judged poor by most professional reviews, anyway). Unlike the redesigned Explorer SUV's four-wheel independednt suspension, the Ranger-based Sport Trac still rides on rear leaf springs, decades-old technology that requires updating for the vehicle to remain competitive. Handling is equivalent to the competition (better, in fact, than the Chevy S-10), and the power-assisted steering is responsive without being over-assisted. Going into the turns and braking the suspension held the vehicle well, though I detected a slight tendency to float through sharp turns. Speaking of turns, the 45-foot turning circle (similar in dimension to competing models) means that this vehicle is by no means a paragon of maneuverability.

A standard five-speed automatic tranny shifts smoothly and predictability; at no time did I sense hunting or hesitation. A five-speed manual transmission is an option on the bottom-most trim level, but otherwaise unavailable (sheesh - what's happening with all the manufacturers dumping manual transmissions?)


<b>Features</b>

The Sport Trac is delivered in three trim levels: XLS, XLT, and XLT Premium, all with the same drivetrain (except that purchasers of the XLS trim must choose between the automatic or five-speed manual). Both two- and four-wheel drive versions are available; 4WD is a shift-on-the-fly part-time version. Stock sound is a 60-watt system with AM/FM and a single CD.

Standard equipment on the base XLS model includes power windows and locks, A/C, three 12V power ports (two on the dash), tachometer, power rear window, a class II hitch, passive anti-theft system, powered rear window, and locking tailgate. Upgrade to the XLT, and you'll find sound system swapped out for an 80-watt AM/FM/Cassette/Single CD, and the steel wheels exchanged for 5-spoke aluminum wheels. Your mirrors are now powered, and you've bought a "convenience group" including cruise control, leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel, and a remote keyless entry system. Upgrade to the XLT Premium level and Ford throws in a "comfort group" with such features as an upgraded console with rear sound and climate controls, six-way powered driver's seat, powered lumbar supports, automatic-off headlamps, and a ceiling information console with thermometer and compass. The XLT premium also has different front bucket seats with a lowered back, and bright aluminum 5-spoke wheels. The XLT Premium Sport Group adds in fog lamps and side step bars; this group and the comfort group are available options for the XLT.

Optional equipment at all trim levels includes the bed extender cage ($195*) or a folding tonneau cover ($560); a powered moonroof is available for the XLT Premium, and a 260-watt Alpine AM/FM system with a 6-disc in-dash CD player is available on either XLT trim. Other available options include heated seats and a leather package. Leer makes a shorty cap for this model; presumably other manufacturers (Raven, etc.) do as well.


<b>Stay Safe!</b>

Standard safety equipment includes front seat airbags for both driver and passenger, shoulder harnesses at all seating positions (the center rear has been upgraded this year from only a lap belt), child safety locks on rear doors, and car-seat tethers in all three rear-seat positions. Front seat belts have energy management and pretensioner mechanisms.

All versions have 4-wheel disc ABS (upgraded this year from rear drum brakes). 

A safety canopy system (side curtain airbags) is available on all trim levels as a $590 option. As an aside, except for the rear-window control, power windows are driven by rocker switches. This design is considered dangerous by child safety advocates, who predict that a child's head or neck can be caught in the rising window as his little feet stand on the rocker switch. Switches that require you to <i>pull</i> upward instead of <i>push</i> downward to raise teh window are judged safer...


<b>Parting Thoughts</b>

Much of my apathy toward this vehicle stems from the fact that Ford has failed to do much in the way of substantial updating of the suspension from a platform that's now in its thirteenth year. In other words, instead of being an Explorer, the truck's not much more than a glorified Ranger - and Rangers are simply not in the same league as the competition or, for that matter, their big brother the F150. I think that if the Sport Trac were actually an Explorer - and had undergone similar updating in the 2002 mode year - that the Sport Trac could be more competitive. As it is, the vehicle gets horrendous mileage (to be fair, so does the competition), has a lousy ride that could only be improved by a suspension update, and has a serviceable but noisy and coarse V6. 

Definite positives include the integral bedliner and roof rails, although if you live in a cold climate you might want to research consumer complaints about cracking liners. That powered rear window, too, is a stroke of genius, though didn't the early 60s Mercury models with that backwards-tilted rear window have the same capability? The necessity to fork over an additional $200 for a bed extender reminds buyers that - regardless of what Ford apologists may claim - this is a poor excuse for a cargo-hauler. But, then again, so are its competitors.

In other words, this attempt to cross over from a passenger vehicle to a cargo vehicle is just average.
