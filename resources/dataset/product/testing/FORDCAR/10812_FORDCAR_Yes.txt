            As our family expanded we found it hard to fit everything we needed in to our 1998 Honda Accord and we definately couldn't fit our stuff into our other car which was a 1986 Honda Prelude. As much as we loved our cars it was time to move to a family van. We did major research on all vans except the Ford Windstar. I wasn't willing to look at a Ford right off the bat because my parents had both had Ford cars in the past and had had nothing but trouble with them. But as we researched and test drove other vans we weren't overly impressed with any of them. My husband finally convinced me to at least look at the Ford Windstar. Thank goodness he did! I was skeptical at first but five minutes into the test drive I was in love. The leg room very impressive. I sat in one of the captains chairs in the middle as my husband and the salesman sat in the front. The seats are very comfortable and wide. The color also helped as I loved the deep red color with the beige undertone. The front and rear air conditioning is great. When there are no windows to roll down in the back it is nice to be able to turn up the air conditioning a little more than the people in the front might need. After we finished the test drive I went home and did research on the Ford Windstar as I was still a lit nervous about buying a Ford. When my inquiries found that it was also highly recommended I jumped at the oppurtunity to purchase it.

At first I was a little nervous about driving the Windstar having never driven anything but small to mid-sized cars in the past. After only a day I was totally comfortable driving it because it handled great. I found the van to be very responsive with great acceleration power and easy handling.

We have owned the Windstar for nearly one year now and have never had to make any repairs or bring it in to the shop for anything more then routine maintenance.

Iwas also impressed the first time I went grocery shopping and realized just how much trunk space there really is. 

My opinion is that the Windstar would be a great minivan for any family or anyone who wants a reliable, comfortable, and good looking minivan.<br><br>
