            If You Need The Room of a large vehicle but detest the cost of filling up a SUV(sport utility) )THAN FOLKS THIS IS THE CAR FOR YOU . FORD HAS SEVERAL SAFETY FEATURES STOCK IN THEIR LINE OF TAURUS AUTOS :ANTI-LOCK BRAKES , DRIVER SIDE AIR-BAGS ,NEWER MAKES PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAGS TO MENTION JUST THREE . MAINTENANCE ON THIS VEHICLE FOR ME HAS BEEN AT A MINIMUM . THE KEY WORD HERE FOLKS IS &quot;ROUTINE&quot;. MY CAR CURRENTLY HAS OVER 108,000 MILES ON THE ORIGINAL ENGINE . I HATE THE FACT THAT &quot;MAJOR REPAIRS&quot; CAN BE MORE EXPENSIVE ON THIS VEHICLE DUE TO THE FACT THAT MOST OF IT'S COMPONENTS ARE NOW COMPUTERIZED , EX:TRANSMISSION AVERAGE COST IN EAST COAST 2500.00$ REBUILT! 
SMOOTH COMFORTABLE RIDE FOR FAMILY OF FOUR , POSSIBLY FIVE IF THE THREE IN THE BACK SEAT ARE CHILDREN . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAR FOR A FAMILY LARGER THAN FIVE . THIS IS A GREAT MULTI-PURPOSE VEHICLE FOR FAMILY OR RETIRED COUPLE THAT MAY ENJOY TO TRAVEL AND NEED GOOD GAS MILEAGE BUT NOT THE CRAMPED FEELING OF A COMPACT CAR!<br><br>
