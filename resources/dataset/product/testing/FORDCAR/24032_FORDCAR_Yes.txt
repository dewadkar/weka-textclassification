            Our '97 Expedition was purchased used in late May 2000, with the primary objective of towing our 19' Travel Trailer. We have taken our trailer out
on 4 trips since we purchased this vehicle, and it has proven to be one
outstanding tow vehicle. We had a 1999.5 Nissan Pathfinder that we replaced with the Expedition. The hills we towed our trailer over with the
Pathfinder @ 40-45 mph, we now can tow the same hills with the Expedition
@ 65-70 mph, if I chose to tow that fast. The vehicle has a tremendous amount of power, that is greatly suited for towing travel trailers, large
boats, or whatever. The fuel economy does suffer greatly when towing, but 
is still alot better than other full size trucks or SUV's. We took a recent trip with our trailer, and got an average 11.4 mpg, for our 1000 
mile round trip. I was very pleased, considering our trailer weighs in at
over 4200#. We have been very pleased with the vehicles fuel economy, we 
get 14.2 mpg around town, and 16.5 - 17 mpg on road trips. That is about the same mpg's that we got with our Pathfinder, and for a much larger SUV,
that to me is pretty amazing. As far as the rest of the vehicles features,
the vehicle is very comfortable, and extremely quiet. It has a very good 
premium audio system w/ 5 CD Changer in center console. Ours has the third 
row seat, that makes it really nice when you need to carry a lot of folks.
All in all we have been extremely happy with our choice of the Expedition, 
and I would highly recommend it for anyone seeking a full size SUV, that 
all the right stuff: comfort, towing capacity, power, people hauling, as well as a great looking SUV. Go buy or lease one and you won't be dissapointed. Do consider buying a slightly used one however, like we did,
as a new vehicle, they are very high priced, but still worth the price!!<br><br>
