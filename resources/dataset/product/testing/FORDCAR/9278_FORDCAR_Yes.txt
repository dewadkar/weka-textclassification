            I recently (three months ago) purchased a used 1999 Ford Contour.  This was not the car I was looking for: far from it.  I wanted a nice, small, two-door economy car, the kind I had to trade in.  (1990 Cavalier)  I was fortunate enough to care for a car dealer's sister ( I am an RN) and after she passed on he recommended that I come to his showroom, so he could &quot;help me out&quot;.  In short, I paid roughly $9,000 for a 1999 Ford Contour, model SE, with all the toys and gizmos.  The reason I went with the Contour was strictly due to the fantastic deal I was getting-$3,000 off the book price is not bad.  So as I drove off the lot, pleased with the deal but initially unimpressed with the car, I thought I had made a very intelligent, adult decision.  Well, I have since grown to appreciate and actually become fond the this car.  The Ford Contour is an ideal young family, young businessman, young ADULT car.  There is ample room for 4-5 people (unlike smaller economy cars which SAY there is room in the backseat........and there is, if you are 5 foot tall)  The engine is adequate for the car-no races will be won, but it has pickup when you need it.  Handling is also adequate.  The ride is generally smooth, again, the best word to describe typical car features is, well, adequate.  You get your money's worth out of this car.  Where the Ford Contour really shines is in pure value.  While testing other cars in the one-two year old category, under $12,000 category, this car stood head and shoulders above the rest.  You get more car for you money here.  It is an attractive design (mine is Cabernet-colored), especially the SE with the faux-chrome, and it is comfortable for adults to ride in.  The extras, a/c, power mirrors, power locks, power windows, cruise, etc etc, all work well and are easy for a busy driver to utilize.  The stock tape deck (since replaced by a CD player and upgraded speakers) was also not bad-for most people it would be adequate.  With gas prices skyrocketing, mileage is again becoming an issue.  The Ford Contour gets reasonable mileage.  In the city, about 25 miles per gallon, on the highway with the a/c off, 40 is common.  Filling fluids (winshield washer, oil, transmission fluid, coolant) is quite easy, with the spouts marked clearly enough that even on a dark night using your watch as a light one should have no trouble.  Trunk space is suprisingly spacious.  Manuevering in a parking lot is also a breeze-parallel parking is easy, as the car is not too large-but larger than it looks once you are inside.  In short, for the young adult on a budget, a family looking for a &quot;family car&quot;, or as a second car for a more established family, the Ford Contour is an excellent choice.  When one compares this car with others in the same class and/or size, then compare sticker prices, the Contour outshines them.  (Accord, Jetta, Grand Am)<br><br>
