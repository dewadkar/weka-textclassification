            I bouhgt my Ford Escort back in June of 1996. It was a 1995 model. I was driving roud trip  to work. This was about 165 miles round trip. I would get any where from 32 miles to the gallon to 38 miles to the gallon with this car. Never ahd any mechancial problems with it until just the last year and a half. And the first thing was the timing belt. We ahd heard from friend that that is very typical of this type of car. That cost us aobut $145 to fix. Then just 6 months ago the transmission went out. That was $1600 to fix. But the car still runs great. WE are at over 107K miles and still getting great gas mileage. My husband is now doing th long commute to work and h trusts it completely. RElaly great, safe and economical cars. I would recommend this car for teens on up.<br><br>
