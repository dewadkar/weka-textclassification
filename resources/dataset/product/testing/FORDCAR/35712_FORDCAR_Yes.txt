               <b>I</b>f any car deserves the credit for bringing back American 'muscle car' performance it is the Ford Mustang 5.0. Though the Mustang was available in a variety of styles, and trim lines, enthusiasts who wanted unbridled power in an unassuming package ordered the LX notchback model. This model was sleek, fast, and cost less than the GT models.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

      In contrast to most of the late '80s-early-1990s' muscle cars, the 5.0 liter powered Mustangs were actually fast with good <b>performance</b> in almost every respect. This car, unlike the base models, and Camaro's was not only dressed up in sporty clothing, it had the engine to back it up. With 300 lb-ft of torque, only a prod of the throttle away, this legendary late model's rear tires will easily be set ablaze through second gear. Oversteer is a fact of life for the 5.0 LX, and takes some getting used to. But, there is more to tis boulevard brawler than outright power. With wide goodyear eagle Z tires and large anti roll bars, this premier performer is a relatively fine handler with good road manners. The quadra shock <b>suspension</b> helps for smooth ride.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

          The LX's <b>interior</b> offers its drivers easy to read instrumentation and supportive bucket seats. Ergonomics are excellent, but amenities are sparce, this is to keep weight and cost down. Rear vision is adequate, but could be better, all other outward vision is good. Cruise control, and Air conditioning are optional. Almost ironic that the car's trim is called 'LX', today we identify LX to be synonymous with luxury or the 'top of the line models.'  A drivers side air bag although is standard, safety obviously was an afterthought when making the Ford Mustang LX..

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

      The <b>exterior</b> is plain compared to todays standard, but the 5.0 LX is not a bad looking car. Hot looking dual pipes, flush mounted headlights, smooth taillights, and slick side glass fitted since 1987 to reduce drag make for a good looking muscle machine.

<i>Pricing:</i>
                      
                  The <b>price</b> for these cars are more than fair. Originally a 90 LX would run about $16,000, today a '90 LX will run around $4,000, money I'd say will be well spent.
