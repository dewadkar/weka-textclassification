            The Ford Taurus overall received three stars from me.What I love: The roominess..the car is extremely roomy inside and is ideal for families. The radio buttons are bigger so you dont have to fiddle around with thesmaller ones while you are driving.There is a incredible amount of room in the trunk as well. It runs very smoothly and i dont even realize that ive already getting up to 70mph:) Another thing is i have gotten in awreck where someone hit me really hard on the front right side tire and although it did some damage it i didnt even receive a scratch and it made me realize how well built it really was..all in all its a great car. What I Dislike: The only dislike i see is that it is an american car.. and you know how they are..i think in my opinion that foreign cars are better in the long run because of greater mileage they'll give. I was given my car but if i could go back i think i would buy a foreign car jsut because i think id spend less on repairs and get more mileage. But always consider safety first in foreign cars also if you have children.. anyways good luck:)<br><br>
