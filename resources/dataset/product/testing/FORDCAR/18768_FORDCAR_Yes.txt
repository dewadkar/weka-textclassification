            I fell in love with this truck when I saw the interior.  I was looking at Lariats but thought the leather inside looked a bit cheap, still the truck was interesting.  I wanted to add captains chairs, a console, a sliding rear window, running boards, and a six-pack CD.  This package had all that, 2-tone paint, and some of the best leather you'll find in a vehicle, for barely more than getting those options separately, so of course I scored it.

I didn't necessarily want the 5.4 motor (4.6 is enough) but you can't find them without this and the tow package.  I am glad I have them now.  It pulls like a demon, is totally smooth, and these will add to resale if I ever want to get rid of this thing.  The tow package also adds an extra oil cooler, so I'm told.  Can't hurt things.

If you're looking at a truck, look at this one.  For the cash I paid and considering what it has, you won't do better.
