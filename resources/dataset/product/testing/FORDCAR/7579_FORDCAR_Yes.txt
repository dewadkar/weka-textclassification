            1998 Expedition Eddie Bauer 2WD:
This is our 3rd SUV so I am going off comparisions to a 87 K5 Blazer and a 2000 Xterra.
My wife and I simply love this vehicle. It provides incredible room for 5 in the front 2 rows. Excellent visibility from the mirrors and windows and good sound throughout with the Mach Stereo/6 disc system.
Driving the vehicle is so easy, the wheel turns easier at slow speeds,(great for parking) stiffer on the highway. The engine (5.4L) provides sufficent power to the rear wheels. I've owned vehicles with too little power (Xterra) and a whole lot (Stealth Twin Turbo) and this one is a good comprimise, very happy with highway acceleration and passing. Tranny feels very smooth. Suspension is very comfortable. And don't listen to people who complain about the gas mileage, it makes no sense to me if someone buys a vehicle this large and wants more that 16 MPG, we're just not there yet.
The only 2 problems I have are minor to me and I have adjusted, it seems to get very loose in light rain, looser than any vehicle I've ever driven, but I've read online that a new set of Yokohama tires do wonders on this vehicle, so I'm checking that out soon hopefully. 
The 3rd row seat severely cuts down on cargo room and it's not very functional for an adult sense. I'll put friends back there on big nights out but would never consider throwing clients or their family back there, it's not a full size seating area.
