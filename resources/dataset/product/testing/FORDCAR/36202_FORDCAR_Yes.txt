            The 2000 Ford Focus ZX3 is a great little car. It was my first car and I couldn't be happier with it. 
The ZX3 model is especially cool because it has a funky look to it, but with the hatch, you can move your belongings, you can go camping, you can travel with it and you can just plain haul stuff. You can shove about 4 people in the back seat. The amount of room in the backseat unbelievable.
The gas mileage is great, but it still has a spunky little engine. I have a manual transmission and I have been known to peel out!
I have gotten so many compliments on my car, because there aren't many on the road yet where I live.
What's great about this car is that it isn't as frumpy looking as the old Escorts. It's a first car that is affordable, cute-looking and really fun to drive.
The sound system is just plain awesome. A CD player is standard, and forget about worrying whether it will skip. It never does. The sound is unbelievable. Hike up the bass just a little bit and you'll be amazed at the sound quality.
I looked around at similar models, but came back to the Focus. It is really worth taking a test drive.
