               Have a big family, but would like a roomy car?  A windstar is what you need!  I have 5 kids and the windstar is great!  The car is very safe.  One time someone's tire flew off of its axle.  Well, this car was right in front of me.  The tire hit my car and no one got hurt at all, the airbags are better than others.  This van also has great looking interior and exterior.  The shape of it makes it look awesome.  The variety of colors look very different and unique.  It is so roomy, no one is angry.  When ever I look at a minivan, I think it doesn't look roomy, safe, or good.  This minivan changed my whole view on minivans and family cars.  The mileage is great as well, I drive all the time and hate having to always stop for gas.  In most cars I need too get gas a lot.  This car is different.

   This van is still a minivan, but in a good way.  It may not be sporty, and it may be good for only families, but it's still a nice car.  My kids have been complaining much less during car trips ever since I got the Windstar.  If you have a big family, this is the way to go.  If you like the way Windstar sounds, check out the Excursion.  If you dislike my review, that's fine.  It's just my opinion.  I'm just trying to help the fellow consumer.
