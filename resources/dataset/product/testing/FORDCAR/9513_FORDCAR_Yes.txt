            I f your looking for race car performance then go no further!!
My '95 pony is a racing machine..The power this motor has is awesome.
it has a high output 5.0 302in it.Every time you floor it you almost get 
whip lash!!and the handling,wow!!!!This thing sticks to the road like glue.And if any of you lead foots out there like to smoke a tire once and while,watch out,the posy track rearend will make you lose control in a hurry!!But if your careful you can have a blast!!!

Now the interior,well all the gauges and dials are well placed.
But if your average size or larger then this is not the car for you.
i actually am a little cramped a 5ft 6.The front and rear are both a little crampy.basically it's for a petite woman or a small man..<br><br>
