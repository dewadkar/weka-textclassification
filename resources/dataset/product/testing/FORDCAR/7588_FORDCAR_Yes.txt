            I start of by saying that our family loves our expedition. In our house it is simply known as &quot;the truck&quot; In Jan of 98 I started doing research on replace our much maligned minivan. I checked the Sloburban first because it was the one I had most heard about. I was surprised at the complete and utter lack of quality throughout. The engine was ahold over from the late 1950s and the  fit and finish was horrible. I checked the Yukon but it wasn't much better. That lead me to the Expedition- I was impressed by the overall quality, the modern drivetrain (Apparently Ford spent more money on research than executive compensation packages) and the ease of operation. In July, we bought the Eddie Bauer edition in black.

Well fast forward  two plus years, and we have logged 33,000 trouble free miles. My wife and I use the vehicle alternately based upon who needs to do what. The truck has been offroad, in rivers, LA city traffic,school runs, grocery runs, and everything in between. Through all off that it has performed flawlessly. The interior has held up quite well considering the amount of kid traffic it sees. The engine (4.6) has towed some pretty big items without any problems.
All in all we highly recommend this SUV. In fact when our lease expired we bought it outright! <br><br>
