            After our old car broke down, we broke down and decided on buying a minivan.  With one son and plans for more(and also have a dog:)) we decided a minivan would be the best choice.  
The Ford Windstar was one of the best looking and also priced great.  I love it for many reason, travels comfortably, fits lots of people, cup holders, 4 door, mini-mirror so I can see my son, alarm, and lots lots more!
This van is a great choice for familys or people that just like to travel with friends and family all in one car.  It may be a mini van but it's so comfortable and lots of neat stuff to make it cool!
