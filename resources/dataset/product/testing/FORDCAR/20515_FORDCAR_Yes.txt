            I was used to driving vans and was ready for a change.  I wanted a SUV and wasn't sure which way to go.  So the search began.  Since I didn't have to have something right away I took the luxury of shopping around.  I was sure I wanted 4WD and started test driving, pricing, negotiating, etc.  

A salesman talked me into driving an AWD V8.  What a pleasant surprise.
Immediately I knew this is what I wanted and I have had no regrets since.

I even had the misfortune of having the &quot;recalled tires&quot; but Ford / Firestone quickly took care of that for me.

The ride is wonderful and all the power features are great!  My favorite is the &quot;combination door locks.&quot;  If you want to leave the car running while you run short errands, warming up in the driveway, paying for gas, etc.  you have no worries and you know you will never be &quot;locked out.&quot;

The AWD is terrific.  It's amazing how it senses the terrain or conditions, but like magic it does and you never have to worry about getting stuck!  

I am convinced that I will stay with the Ford Explorer AWD V8 as long as they keep making them.
