                I originaly bought this amazing car because O.J. Simpson had one! No im just kidding I actually bought it because my Uncle was selling it for a very reasonable price and he told me that it was a great car. I bought the car with a little hesitation but after I drove it once I fell in love with it! The Ford Bronco has great turning has plently of room is very comfortable and is also a very good looking car! I own a 1990 Ford Bronco and it has 145,000 miles on it and as far as I know it has not had a serious problem yet! I highly reccomend this car for any one who is looking for a nice car that is very good for taking trips to the Mountains and for every day driving!<br><br>
