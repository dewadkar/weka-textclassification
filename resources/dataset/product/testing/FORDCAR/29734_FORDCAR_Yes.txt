            I purchased the Ford Explorer Sport 2 years ago.  I had been in the market for an SUV for several years before finally purchasing the Sport.  The Sport was a good choice for me for several reasons.  The Sport is less expensive than the classic Explorer (four door), I had no need for 4 wheel drive, I wanted a safe vehicle in which to transport myself and my family, and it is a great looking SUV.  The four door Explorers do have a more &quot;family-van&quot; feel to me and fun was definitely part of the emotional reasoning to purchase the Sport.  

The engine is a V-6, but still a little gutless when climbing.  I have a long time family mechanic that has seen very little problems with the Sport as long as general maintenance is done on a regular basis and the overall maintenance guidelines suggested by Ford in the vehicle manual are followed.  So far the only problems I have encountered are a broken thermostat and clutch fan.  My mechanic say the German built engine is a sound one, but repairs can be pricey.  Keep the fuel filter replaced regularly as well.  

The down sides of the Sport have been the inconvenience of only 2 doors with 2 adults and two teenagers in the family.  The Sport handles okay, but due to its relative lightness, it doesn't handle particularly well on tight corners and has a tendency to drive a little &quot;softer&quot; than I'd like.  It is an enjoyable vehicle to drive and my 5'10&quot; daughter is pretty comfortable in the back seat as long as the front seat is adjusted to accommodate her legs.  The kids appreciate the ability to control the music and AC/Heat from the back as well, although both the kids and the dogs would have preferred roll down windows as opposed to the small pop out wing windows.  With all said and done, I am pleased with my purchase and feel the Explorer Sport is a great value.<br><br>
