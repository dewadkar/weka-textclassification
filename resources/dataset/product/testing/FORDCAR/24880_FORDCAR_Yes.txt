            In all honesty, how can you not love a Mustang? 260 hp, V-8, 4.6 Liter F-Body eating machine. There is a reason the Camaro/Firebird/Trans Am is no longer being made.....They are being out sold by the Mustang better than 2 to 1, and that's with combined efforts of all three F-Body versions. The Mustang was redesigned for it's 35th anniversary, and man does it look sharp! The New Edge design is a great way to take the old Fox Body from 94-98 and re-vamp it for the new millenium. If you haven't noticed...New Edge design is not limited to cars, other companies have followed suit, such as Boeing and other airplane business'. In short, the Mustang is here to stay.<br><br>
