            Why on earth would you purchase an Excursion over an Expedition? Is the few inches added on to what already is a ridiculously huge, really necessary!? By all means no!

We've had an Expedition for about two years now, and while it's not perfect, it is a far more impressive specimen than the Excursion. Built off of the frame of the F-150, if the Expedition is not big enough for you, than you need to vehicles anyways. At it's size now though, the Expedition is very difficult to drive around town. The sheer size forces you to worry more about other drivers than yourself.

The cargo space is adequate and it is quite roomy, except when you sit in the Stadium seating back seat (I'm reasonably tall so my head lays against the ceiling). We have had a few problems with the Expedition in recent months, I worry that the normal Ford reliability, just isnt there. But all in all please buy this car before you even think about the Excursion.
