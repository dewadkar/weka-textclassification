            I have owned my 1997 Ford Ranger for about 7 months now.  While I didn't buy it new, it was in perfect condition, and had very low mileage.  I bought the truck because I needed a vehicle that was versatile.  I can haul just about anything a college student needs to haul, it gets very good gas mileage, and it is very fun to drive.  However, it is absolutely horrible driving in ice or snow.  I recommend this truck to younger drivers who may need a vehicle for driving back and forth from college, to anyone who needs a truck for the purpose of hunting and general outdoors, and to anyone who loves trucks, but may not be able to afford a fullsize pickup.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who want to haul around a multitude of people, or to anyone who may live in areas of the country that get a lot of ice and snow throughout the year.  Also, no one who considers themselves very tall should buy this truck.<br><br>
