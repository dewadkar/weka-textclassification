            In my opinion, the Ford Explorer, is the BEST of the ATVs, I am in the 
construction business, and am able to also use it as a family car. The 
4 wheel drive allows Me to go places I can not go with 2 wheel drive, and
also allows Me to get around Very well on winter roads.

My Wife also uses it to travel to Dog Shows, and finds it very comfortable
to drive long distances, as well as roomy enough in the cargo area to hold
all of the equipment She needs plus Her dogs.<br><br>
