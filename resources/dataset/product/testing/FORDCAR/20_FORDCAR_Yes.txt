            I have a 99 taurus.  It is a company leased vehicle.  I have not had any problems what so ever with it.  It has 30k miles on it and I got it on may 18 1999.  So you can see I drive alot.  The car has a comfortable ride, good gas milage and a very solid feel.  I recommend the taurus for everyone from 16 year olds for the safety to senior citizens for the comfort.  The Taurus, to me, is alot of car for the money.  I have an SE model that stickered at $19,125.  This car has all the power options, keyless entry, cassette stereo,&amp; auto.  Before I received this car I used to notice alot of them on the road, now I know why.  I am 6' 4&quot; tall and am usually cramped in cars but not in this one.  I have about 3 inches of space for my head even!!!  Ford made a winner here and the 2000 model looks like a step up!  <br><br>
