                 My 1997 Ford Expidition XLT is nearing the end of its three-year lease, and I want to take this opportunity to summarize my experiences with this truck.
     The Expidition was my first truck, my first SUV, and the first one I was even remotely interested in owning and driving.  To me, the initial drive dispelled any notion that this was a truck in the vein of the Suburban or Tahoe--its chief rivals.  The Expidition drives and handles remarkably like a tall car, and for engineering this feature into the SUV Ford has made the Expidition attractive to buyers who wouldn't otherwise consider an SUV.
     Strong points for the Expidition are an exceptionally comfortable and commodious interior, bouncy but gentle ride (with the standard suspension), enormous carrying capacity, and general reliability.  Negative points include the expected dismal in=town gas mileage (11-14 mpg), relatively slow acceleration (when new, the truck was beaten by diesels), and some tendency for small trim pieces to fail.
     But the real pleasure of the Expidition is in the driving.  Whetjer used as a hauler, a daily grocery shopper, or a luxury barge to drive to the club, the Expidition's dynamic qualities are first-rate.  Steering is quick and accurate, brakes are powerful four-wheel-discs, and the general driving experience is pleasant enough for women, wile still providing a robust feel for the guys.
     Anyone looking for a large station-wagon type vehicle, or a mini-van, would do well to look at an Expidition.  Particularly in XLT 4.6 form, the EXpidition represents good value at a list price of around $35,000 loaded.  Other options to be checked out include the as-yet-unreleased 2000 Suburban/Tahoe, the Lincoln Navigator, Toyota/Lexus Land Rover/LX470 twins, and the various Land Rovers.<br><br>
