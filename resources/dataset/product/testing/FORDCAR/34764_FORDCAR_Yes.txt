              The Ford Escort zx2 is a great car for a person that does not want a big one, or it would be a perfect car for a person just learning how to drive.  

  The Ford Escort ZX2 Looks Sporty and Most people these days like cars to look sporty.  The Apperence is a Beaut.  This Little car will Run for a Long time if you treat it right and keep up on everything.  Under the Hood the engine might be a little small depending on if it is a v4-v6, but either one it runs fast.  The inside of the car is comfortable, the seats are very comfortable, theres good space in the car, Quality of Sound, If you are able to have a cd player in it, any cd will play good in that car.  

  I used to have a Ford Escort ZX2 until it ended up getting in a car wreck.  I drove that car everyday to work and back and went on a lot of trips with it. It was a 2001 Escort ZX2 and I think it had around 20,000 miles before it got I got into a Wreck. When I had that car I never had a problem, it always started up, Always ran great, Never made any noises, the only time that car was in the shop was to get a oil change or tire rotated. 

  The Ford Escort ZX2 has many great features about it, It is really good on gas, the tank is not that big but you do not waste much when you travel, The look is sporty, Quality Car, Premium Sound, CD players in some, All Features that are standard, Power Windows, Power locks, Power Steering and more.  These are all features that my Ford Escort ZX2 had.  

  I would have to say if you are looking for a car that is quality and won't break down on you quickly after you buy it, this would be the perfect car for you.  This would also be a great car for a new driver, its little and compact but has that sporty look that people look for.  The cost for these cars are not too bad, used ones that i have seen can be anywhere from 3,995-9,995 and new ones 12,900 and up, those are prices that i have seen in the state that i live in, I am sure you can find them at all different kinds of prices.  

  This is Just a overall great Car and would make a Great addition to a person not looking for that big car, and looking to save on gas. I recommend this car to anyone.
