            I test drove the XLT escape 4x4, wedgewood blue, moonroof, privacy glass, automatic, and towing package.  I loved it and ordered a bright red XLT 4x4, moonroof, automatic, and towing package.  It rides like a car but you are up higher and can see more of the road.  It had plenty of leg room, since I'm six foot tall I need this feature.  I sat in the rear seat and it also had lots of leg room as well as head room.  It had a roomy cargo area and I tested this out by using a briefcase, box, and laptap computer and case in the back. It still had plenty of room.  The rear seat folds down easy and gives even more cargo area.  

The interior is nice, I like cloth better and the cloth had a nice feel to it.  The controls are within easy reach and the glove box seemed roomy. I wish it had some storage under the seats but designers can't be perfect. The radio was both CD and cassette and it seemed really easy to use without reading the manual. I also loved the moonroof and it gave plenty of natural light inside the cab.  The only complaint I have about the interior is the gear shift blocks some of the controls from view.  I also don't like the fact that it is directly behind the wiper controls so I kept turning on the wipers everytime I shift.  I guess this is a small inconvenience for all the positive interior features.

I also liked the exterior.  I wasn't sure I would like the cladding on the bottom, but it really blended in well.  It looks almost like an explorer and I love the cargo holder on top.  I also love the fact that both the window and the hatch open in the back to the cargo area.  It seems to have the lights placed nicely and the fog lights are located on the bottom of the front.

The fact the outside door handles look cheap is a feature I don't like.  Another feature I don't like is the passenger side door doesn't have a key entry hole, which could pose a problem if your driver's side door freezes in the winter.  

On the average, I rate this car pretty high.

I now have owned this car since December 2000 and really enjoy this vehicle.  I have 60,000 miles on it and have only had to replace the tires and have one wheel bearing replaced (under warranty).  I also replaced the brakes but it wasn't required but I believe in safety.

I have gone camping with my SUV and it holds all my gear as well as a child seat.  I have towed a camping trailer with my vehicle, drove to Colorado from MIchigan and back, and have gone two tracking.  It is so versitile.

My car still looks new on both the inside and outside and boy has the cloth held up.  I was surprised how I have been able to keep the cloth seats so clean, especially with a dog that rides all the time.

I loved this vehicle in 2000 and still love it today.  I am also going to be purchasing the new electric model of the Ford Escape as soon as it hits the market.  I can't wait to keep enjoying my ford esape experience and have recommended this vehicle to so many people.  Many of those have purchased this vehicle and love it just as much as I have.

Besides, the new models have so many features to choose from than from when I purchased the vehicle.

Enjoy.
