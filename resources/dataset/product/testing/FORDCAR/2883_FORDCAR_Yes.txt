            I bought a new Ford Escort LX in 1993, in the 7 years i have owned this car, not one major problem has gone wrong.  I bought this as a first new car, looking for a cheap and dependable car.  I loved it, ride quality was great, and plenty of room for a young person, or just a work car.  My husband has now taken over this car to drive back and forth to work in and its still going strong.  I can say that it is a much better quality car than the new ones.  So if you are in the marked for a used car, check out used Ford Escorts!  You will be pleased!  <br><br>
