             If you want a smaller truck that can do it all a ford ranger might be your answer, The very first new vehicle I ever owned was a beautiful blue extra cab ranger, it was a 95 model, I wish that I had kept it, I loved it, but the family was growing and we needed more interior room. My husband works as a mechanic for our local ford dealership and he knows the vehicles that are the most dependable, the ranger is one of the best trucks on the market, my husband swears that he has only seen a couple rangers in the shop over the 5 year period that he has worked there, other than for routine maintenance, I owned mine for 2 1/2 years and I never had a problem with it, it rode great, very little wind noise, and the best part was that when we put it up for sale we actually got the same price that we had paid for it new after 2 1/2 years of driving it,so obviously they hold their value.If you  are in the market for a truck I would suggest looking closely at the ranger, they are really nice, you can't go wrong.<br><br>
