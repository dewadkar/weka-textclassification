            WOW! I like driving my 2000 Mustang v-6, 5-speed more and more each day.  I bought it because the price was right,  the engine is powerful, the styling is beautiful, and it handles well. 
The interior is clean and simple, yet it comes with a great list of standard features. 
Driving the pony car couldn't be more exciting.  Put your foot down, and let the RPMs climb, pop the clutch-and your off! 
the big v-6  roars, putting thoes little buzzing japanese go-carts to shame.  Don't be afraid to dive into curves or sharp turns either.
the Mustang handles like it's magnetized to the pavement. 
For everyday A-B driving, the mustang is well mannered on the road. Keep your RPMs down for a smooth quiet ride, and better fuel economy.   
It's a bit bigger and roomier than other sports cars in it's price range, so you can get 2 sets of golf clubs, or a bike in the trunk with the seats folded down. (standard)  
I think anyone would be happy with a Ford Mustang.  Even if you are dead set on a foreign car give the Mustang a try, you might just change your mind. it's come a long way since 1964.  <br><br>
