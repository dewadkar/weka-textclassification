            I have a 96 Contour GL--4 cylinder, ABS, alloy wheels. I bought it with 27,000 miles on it for $10,000 and thought it was a pretty good deal. I was looking for a solid car like an Accord, but didn't want to pay their inflated resale prices.

I have generally been pretty happy with the Contour. It does handle pretty well, especially with the larger tires. The interior of the car is nice, the seats are very comfortable, and I'm 6' 3&quot; and it doesn't feel cramped at all. Contrary to other reports, I haven't found the rear seats to be cramped--maybe I share the European aesthetic for smaller spaces, but I found the seats to be quite comfortable. I also like the styling of the car, it holds it own against more expensive cars.

The main problem I have with the car is that I have had some rather large problems with my car. The biggest problem is actually a known defect. In a lot of 4 cylinder engines they have quite bad vibration problems. In my car it becomes apparent when the car is stopped it felt like I was holding onto a lawn mower. I took the car into the Ford dealership and they said this was common and they replaced the entire steering column and airbag. It was quite an ordeal to fix. I also have had a problem with the plastic skirting underneath the car (it goes underneath the radiator and up to the tires). It fell off its main bolts when I was driving on the highway, yet it was still held on by four screws to the tires wells. So I had to drag the thing until I could pull over to the side and  finally get a gas station attendant to help out with a wrench to get the screws off. So, these have been two pretty faulty problems--both just aren't bad luck, they are known design flaws in the Contour.

So I am still fairly happy with the car, it is a pretty good deal. But as in all things in life, you get that for which you pay. If you're going for a normal sedan the Accord is probably of higher quality, and if you want a sportier sedan the BMWs are probably of much higher quality.<br><br>
