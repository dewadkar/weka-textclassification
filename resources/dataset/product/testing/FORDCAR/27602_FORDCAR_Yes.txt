            First of all let me make it absolutely clear that I am reviewing the Escape XLS which is available in SINGAPORE. Some of the features or complaints I have may not apply to those models available in other countries.

I took delivery of the SUV on 1 September 2001. After driving it for 3 weeks, I feel that I am ready to write a review on it.

<B>Interior</b>

Before buying the Escape, I compared it with the Honda CRV and Toyota RAV4. Although it's engine may not be as refined as the other 2 competitors, I decided on the Escape primarily because I like its looks (kind of like a scaled down version of a Land Rover) and sheer interior space. It has got to be the SUV with the largest cabin space in its class.

I was driving a Mercedes E200 prior to this and I have to say that I don't feel any reduction in the interior space at all switching to the Escape. Even with the front seats pushed all the way back, there is still comfortable room for the rear seat passengers. The headroom is also very ample. Because of that passengers tend to look "small" seated in the car. I don't feel the same sense of spaciousness with the CRV and RAV4.

<B>Exterior</b>

When it comes to the looks, of course it is very subjective. I like it because it looks like a Land Rover without the bulk. The bumpers are very distinctive. I love the fact that they are made of unpainted fiberglass. Bumpers are called that precisely because in the ordinary course of a car's life, it is bound to "bump" into something or is "bumped" into by something else. To have bumpers that are painted is to invite heart-ache and unnecessary distress for new car owners. You are almost certain to find scratches on the bumpers (especially the corners) after a while.

With unpainted fiberglass, on the other hand, the scratches are hardly noticeable if at all. Also, the Escape's entire lower body is surrounded by these fiberglass pieces - all around the car. That makes it less susceptible to scratches that usually appear in all cars after some time being in use.

Unlike some other SUVs, the spare wheel is not attached to the back door of the car. Like a regular saloon, it is located inside the "boot" area. I prefer this configuration because this way, the back door is lighter can be opened more easily. It swings upwards instead of sideways, thus needing less space to open.

Another rather unique design of the Escape is the ability to open the "glass" part of the back door without having to lift up the whole door itself. This is really a space saver, not to mention much more convenient especially if you need to just take out some small item from the boot.

I also like the fact that the Escape comes with the roof rack (cross bars) already installed. Most other SUVs only come with the side rails, without the actual cross bars which are necessary if you wish to put things on the roof of the car.

I don't quite like the radio antenna which sticks out like a sore thumb permanently just in front of the driver side. Ford could have put in a retractable antenna.

<B>Engine</b>

The Escape comes with 2 versions in Singapore: XLT (4x4) and XLS (4x2). I decided against the 4x4 version because here in Singapore, I won't get any chance to use the car off road. Also, comparing the specs, I discovered that the 4x2 is slightly more powerful. Also, I felt that the extra cost of the 4x4 is not justifiable.

The Escape has a 4 cyclinder 16-valves in-line 2.0l DOHC engine. Not exactly a new design nor particularly refined. It boasts of a modest 134PS/99kW@5,400 rpm max power and 18.9kgm/186Nm@4,500 rpm max torque.

I find the engine rather noisy. In fact my 7-year old Mercedes E200 seemed to be quieter! This is especially so during quick accelerations.

The other noise I notice seems to come from the aircon compressor. I hear it switching on and off very regularly throughout the journey. So much so that with the radio switched off, it can get a bit irritating at times.

Speaking of the aircon, I find the design of the controls a bit dated. It is a throw back to the early 90's. There is no "auto" setting for the fan speed - just 1,2,3 & 4. 1 is practically useless as the fan is too weak.

<B>Handling</b>

The Escape drives like a saloon. In fact I think it beats the saloon because you have the high vantage point in this car. The steering is very responsive.

Overall visibility is also very good. With the large side mirrors, I virtually have no blind spot.

I find the shock absorbers a little too stiff for my liking but I guess that's how SUVs are built, you know, to handle all the rough terrain!

<B>Conclusion</b>

Well you really can't have it all. At this price, I think the Escape is really value for money. Although it may not be the best SUV around, it is fun to drive, looks good and is probably be what every man facing mid-life crisis (who is not into Harleys) needs.
