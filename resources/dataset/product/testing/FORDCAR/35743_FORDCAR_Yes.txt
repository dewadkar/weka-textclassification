            My father gave this car to me when he bought a larger vehicle that was more suitable for our large family.

I am a 17 year old high school senior. When I first began to drive the car, I didn't really get to experience it like a Mustang should, what with my father driving with me. 

But now that it's mine, it's simply astounding. The car stereo's bass and treble features make the ride much more enjoyable. 

I took my boyfriend on a date the past weekend and we had the greatest time driving around. When I took him home late that night, he pushed the seat back and appeared to be drifting off. That image will probably be the most memorable for as long as I have this car, because it's the first real memory I have of it as *my* car.

I don't recommend this car to anyone who is starting a family or has one. There are four children in my family and we have never been able to all go out at the same time in this car. Also, three of us being teenagers, we usually can't fit in the backseat anyhow, as it is very small.

Those seats are about as functional as the backseats of pick-up trucks. They are there, but no one would ever use them unless they absolutely had to.

I have mostly used the backseat as a place for my shopping bags and purse whenever I am too lazy to put them in the trunk. Of course, contents do shift around, and that is a downside.

The length of the car is another thing. I am a very small person, about 5'4" and 90 pounds. The car's length makes steering for someone like me (with very little grip on the wheel) often difficult and strenuous. The design appears aerodynamic, but I believe it really just causes the center of gravity to be shifted to somewhere else in the car where it does not belong. 

Overall, a great car for a young kid like myself.
