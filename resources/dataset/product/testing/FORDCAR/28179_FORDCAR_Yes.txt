                     I am a 19 year old college student in Illinois and my 1995 Ford Taurus Stationwagon GL was given to me by my parents upon graduating from highschool.  I have driven it since my sophomore year and have put about 40k miles on it.  When I first was given the Taurus at age 16, I was flaming mad, every teenager deserves a Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet or at the very least a Dodge Viper RT/10, and here I was stuck with the family wagon.   
         I was rather upset at this fact for a long while but as I grew older and matured I began to appreciate what the Taurus did for me more and more.  The standard engine with the GL package is the 3.0 liter Vulcan engine, it is an OHV(Overhead Valve) and it puts out roughly 145hp and similar torque.  That is pretty weak considering that the engine needs to move 3600lbs of Bull.  Most big Lincoln's have 275hp and 250lb/ft of torque and weigh 3400 lbs, use that as reference.  So acceleration is meager, 0-60 in about 12 seconds, and the first 45 are exceedingly slow.  The Vulcan shines in 3rd gear, you can really feel some power when you juice it at 65 MPH, getting from 65 to burying the needle(above 85 MPH) only takes a few seconds.  
         The space available as a wagon is very nice, the model I had was equipped with the fold down 3rd seat, so it seated 8(pretty tight though), which was very nice.  It has massive room to carry things and is incredibly versatile, I can remember carrying about 700lbs of canned goods in the flat area(seats folded down) and 3 friends home from a school food drive and it handled it fine.  There is enough room to transport a 50cc scooter to and from school and when the seats are folded down, it has enough room to have a good time with a member of the opposite se..... well you get the point.....  gimme a break I'm 19!!!!
         Being the shrewd teenager that I am, I decided to add some aftermarket stuff to it.  Nothing gaudy like those rice burning Honda Civics out there, but I still had fun with it.  I added a hood bra(not a full bra, just the hood) which makes it look nicer and &quot;protects&quot; from bouncing stones.  I replaced the amber turnsignals with clear halogen bulbs which light up the surrounding area(very useful at night if there are no streetlights).  I just recently put on 2 Tenzo R Hyperwhite 500X foglamps.  The wiring was a bear, but it took under 2 hours, and they look really really nice, especially with the clear tun signals.  The epitome of my Taurus customization is what I am working on now, I bought a used Lincoln Continental engine and transaxle(32,000 miles) taken from a car that had been rearended and had the chassis cracked.  I am in the process of buying new motor mounts and other things that I will need in order to drop it in the Taurus.  When that huge task is finished it will be very very nice as well as very very fast because I changed the gearing around(it tops out at about 110, but runs 0-60 in about 6.5).  
         Regardless of how I felt when I first got the Taurus, I am incredibly happy with her now.  I wouldn't trade her for anything(that's probably a lie... care to test it?) and I enjoy driving her every day.  She's very sleek and sexy to look at and the smooth lines add to her aerodynamics.  All around a very nice car once you get past the face that it is a stationwagon and that it is not a sports car(yet....)<br><br>
