            Actually went looking for a 4door sedan when we started looking and comparing on the internet, it was just such a hassle free way of comparing Car Makes and models and when we had narrowed the field some we went to a couple different dealerships to compare the comfort and ease of getting in and leg room and that eliminated quite a few, I'm a large person, and tall so head room is a premium to me. Most medium size sedans are just don't have enough comfortable room, we like to take trips of about 300 to 400 miles,parents and relatives, and some fuel economy, a reason for the medium size, but the more we tried the less we liked or considered these as an alternative. Then we happened to see a Mini Van and it was at a Ford dealership and we climbed in and surprise plenty of room, head, legs,comfort,arm rests on all the seats, 4 doors, 2 sliding doors which was great because we have grandchildren that use a car seat and no one has to climb over it to get to a seat. We've had 6 adults in it and although you have to be a little agile to get into the rear seat it's not impossible and I like the bench seats instead of the captains chairs, you can lay down, especially kids, and the middle seat does fold down so it's pretty easy to get into the back bench seat which has very convenient cup holders in the window frame. We recently took a trip to the Windy City with 4 adults and 1 child and it was a real pleasure trip. Another great feature that we've discovered is we've been doing some remodeling on the house and we've been buying some cabinets and other large items and instead of having to pull out the seats to get them  in the middle and back seats just fold down and everything just slid in. And I can't say enough about the sound system that Ford has in the Windstar, its both CD and Cassette player and AM FM radio, I have a bunch of cassettes from my previous car and I really love the sound quality you get from CDs and I never thought I would be able to get both without going to the after market expense of adding to the car's system, so this is a real premium and if you're so inclined it will crank up to just about every music lovers sound level. We have just thoroughly enjoyed our trips and now that my wife has learned to get in and out with ease, she's a short person, my parents have no problem getting into the middle seat and the grandchildren love the back seat. There's convenient hangers on the back of the rear seat to hang bags of groceries and although it was a little tight on the storage room for the luggage on the trip with 4 adults and 1 child, we have found a solution, the Van has a roof rack and a water tight luggage baggage container for the top of the Van has cured that and with a little shopping you can find them under $100 and believe me well worth it. So far we haven't found anything we don't like about this Van, it's a pleasure to even drive to the grocery and very easy to load, rear tail gate lifts up with little ease and the storage aids are a real help. This Windstar also comes with the backup warning system and if I was anybody and this option was available please consider getting it, it starts beeping if there is anything behind the van and kids are usually down low enough that you can't see them from the drivers seat when backing up or any other objects for that matter, backing into a garage or any space the beeps get faster as you get closer and before you hit anything it becomes a steady beep. A very convenient option I would not do without. We are so very pleased with this vehicle that in this day and age there is something that pleases you so much because we've all bought something that we really thought was great only to live with for a while and find out it's not up to all our expectations, but here I think we've found something that's gone beyond our expectations and after 2 long trips, 1 with just the 2 of us and the other with adults and kid and 6 months of every day life it's a real joy to do all of life's pleasures  as far as travel has to be done. So if you're considering a vehicle I hope this little insight helps you on your way down a happy road to a great adventure.<br><br>
