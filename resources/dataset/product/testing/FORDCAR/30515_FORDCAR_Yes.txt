            I pull a three horse trailer with each horse weighing about 1000 lbs each.  When I am pulling the trailer with the horses, I feel like there's no weight behind me at all.  I've always had Chevy's, but now I'm sold on the Ford Powerstroke.  Not only is it fit to pull my horses, but its also great for my family.  My wife and I have 3 tall teenagers and we can all fit comfortably whether its a short trip or a long trip.  Its the cadillac of trucks.  I think anyone who wants comfort and power should drive this truck.<br><br>
