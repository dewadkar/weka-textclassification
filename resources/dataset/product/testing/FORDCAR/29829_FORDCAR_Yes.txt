            My husband &amp; I own a 1996 Ford Escort Wagon, and we bought it brand spanking new. In fact, it was my first, and my husband's second, new car. 

We mostly got it for its tons of cargo space, 4 doors, hatchback, and for its affordability. We got it with a 5 speed standard transmission, as our other car is also a standard. 

It also came with all the other usual options: A/C, 4 speaker FM/AM stereo radio, dual map lights, rear defrost, rear windshield wiper, day/night rear view mirror, and a roll-away vinyl (?) cargo cover. Etc...

5 months after my husband &amp; I bought the car, and thankfully 2 years before my son was born, we were in a serious car accident. An 85 year old woman coming the other way, through an intersection, turned right in front of us at the last minute. My husband slammed on the brakes, and desperately tried to avoid her, but we were way too close to her when she turned in front of us.

The passenger side corner of her car (one of those big Oldsmobile types) hit the exact center of the front bumper of our car. Basically, she hit US head on...

Well... Both air bags, driver's &amp; passenger's side, deployed as she crashed into us. I still cannot believe how fast they raced into action! One moment we're desperately trying to stop, and the next the air bags hit us in the face. It actually felt like someone had slapped me in the face, it stung all over. It was such a frightening &amp; surreal experience! One I never care to repeat...

When we finally came to a standstill, our car had been pushed back 10 feet, and our front license plate had come off, and was in the middle of the intersection. 

I will warn other Escort owners that when the driver's side air bag has been deployed the horn blares incessantly. All you need to do to remedy this annoying condition, is pull the fuse for the horn out. You can find the location of the fuse in your owners manual. 

Our poor car looked like we had run it into a telephone pole, it was all crumpled in front, and it was oozing green antifreeze all over the pavement...

Other than a really bad bone bruise to my left shin, and assorted bruises, I walked away from the accident. My husband only had superficial scrapes and bruises. I believe that we would have been hurt far worse if we did not have air bags in our car, and had not been using our seat belts. They really are wonderful safety innovations! 

There was well over $6K of damage done to our car. The woman's insurance accepted liability for the accident the next day with no argument. They paid for the repair of our car, plus all of our medical costs. It took 1 month to totally restore our car, and now you cannot tell the car was ever in a head on crash. 

Other than for oil changes, and other maintenance things, our car has only been in the shop once in all the years we've owned it (Knock on wood!!!) All it turned out to be was a hose that came loose from the carburetor. I didn't have to pay a thing for that visit too! It was totally covered under my warranty.

Needless to say, I highly recommend the Ford Escort Wagon. :)
