            I must say when my cousin pulled up in her new stang convertible I was impressed at first sight and then I came to a quick realization, she'd been taken for a ride.  She bought the car wanting something that would be an attention grabber.  Well, I must say that the most attention that the car has received has been from the mechanic at the Ford dealership. In the first weeks of owing the car the odometer stopped working, which is not a big problem but still lead her to a day without a car. Then the anti-theft light started to come on for no reason, along with the airbag light which made no sense.  The biggest problem remains, the oil light, if you park the car on a hill the light comes on. A week or two ago the intake manifold cracked with left her with a big towing bill and another week and a half without a car. It also lacks in power that one would expect from a V8.  When you ride in the car you can here the top rattling whenever you hit the slightest bump.  The overall ride is not smooth at all.  With the upkeep expenses and the gas guzzler quality that these cars possess I would not recommend this to anyone unless you don't mind spending all of your time in a rental car.<br><br>
