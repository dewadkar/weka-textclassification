I've owned trucks from all three major US automakers, and also had to drive trucks from Japanese automakers for a previous employer.  A year ago, when I was ready for a new truck, I wanted to buy a truck once and for all, something that would last for a long time, 250,000 miles or more, and never fail me.  I also knew I wanted a large truck, a truck that would never prevent me from carrying, towing, pushing, pulling anything I wanted, whenever I wanted.  After several weeks of research into the Dodge Ram, the Ford F-Series, the GMC Sierra, and even the Toyota Tacoma, the Ford came out the clear winner for me.  

I've been driving my Ford F250 Super Duty Crew Cab for 8 months now, and it is by the best truck I've ever owned or driven.  My previous truck, a Ford F150 XL 4x4 long bed, is a toy compared to my F250, and the truck I had before that one (a Chevy S10) was even worse.

This epinion pertains to my personal F250: Super Duty XLT, Crew Cab (4 full doors), 4x4 offroad, Triton V10, short bed.  It's basically the big brother to the current large-size Ford SUV, the Excursion.  I bought this vehicle because I wanted the most practical vehicle possible, and this truck fits my requirements perfectly.  With the Crew Cab, I have room for 5 (6 if you want to be friendly) adults without sacrificing any payload capacity in the bed.  Cab capacity was something I missed in every previous truck I drove or owned.  I hated going Christmas shopping or grocery shopping in a standard cab pickup truck, and having to put the bags on the seat where they fell off when turning.  Now, I have no problems riding with friends, my German Shepherd, groceries, or anything else I need to carry.

I bought my truck with the shift-on-the-fly 4WD option, and I love it.  It's much better than the extra lever on the floor that I had in my old truck.  I have a cottage in northern Michigan, and shifting into 4WD as soon as I leave the highway is a piece of cake, as is shifting back to 2WD on my way out.  No need to worry about locking/unlocking the front wheel hubs, etc.

Driving this truck is great.  The V10 doesn't mess around when it comes to acceleration...it's better than a lot of sedans in that respect, even considering the truck's size.  The extra height makes for great sight lines, and the crew cab means you can carry stuff in the cab without having it distract you or bump and slide into you while you are driving.  The front seat is a 40/20/40 split, which makes longer journeys more comfortable.  The flip-down center console has plenty of room inside of it, including more than enough room for my Dell laptop.  The extra 12-volt outlet makes charging my cell phone and powering my laptop at the same time simple.  I'm a large person, and even with the driver's seat set for me, I can still sit in the back seat and have plenty of leg room.  There is more than enough room in the cab for 4-6 large adults, with assorted extra baggage...the cab is extremely comfortable!

Anyone desiring a large, practical vehicle who intends to keep the vehicle for a significant amount of time should consider purchasing a Ford F250 Super Duty Crew Cab.  It's an even better buy than the Excursion:  very few people have a consistent need to carry 9-10 people around, so the Excursion is overkill.  With a truck like my F250, you can have the best of both worlds: cab capacity and bed capacity at the same time.  When I purchased my truck, my price was actually about $500 more than the price my wife paid for her Ford Explorer 2-door 4WD Sport.  You can't deny that the F250 Super Duty Crew Cab is a much better value than any SUV, even the Excursion or Suburban.
