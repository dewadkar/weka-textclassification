                    I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc...  points of view. I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from an undercar point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear.
       There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles, I hope to help you decide based on my experience, which one will be better for you from the standpoint of  strength of, and reliability of, one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole, the steering and suspension system.

     Ford Motor Company finally did something about deep sixing that engineering disaster, the idiotically designed and ever so hated twin I-beam suspension. I don't for the life of me know what they were ever thinking. But it's gone. And forgotten.
 
      I love what they did with the new Ford pickups across the board. They ditched the Twin I-beam for a more conventional and universally accepted SLA suspension. It very much resembles the Chevrolet K-1500 suspension which I also reviewed well.

      Gone are the weak coil springs. Gone is the good old Ford nose down attitude. Gone is the old moniker of fix or repair daily. Now what you get from the Ranger on up is a completely re-designed and well engineered intelligent suspension. It has conventional upper and lower control arms, with the springing done by a hefty set of torsion bars instead if the previously mentioned poor excuse old style coil springs.

     You get a good sized anti sway bar package, aiding in giving you a more comfortable ride, and a more positive steering feel. It is heading in the right direction comfort wise, but you still need to remember this is still a truck, it won't ride like anything more. But it truly is miles ahead of the older F series.

     I have noticed a few post re-design F-150's with some lower ball joints wearing prematurely, but this seems an exception rather than a rule. Of course as with most modern vehicles, you are limited as to what the factory will allow you to grease suspension wise, so keep the front suspension in check whenever you do oil changes to make sure things are not starting to loosen up.

    Most things Ford has done in re-designing their front suspensions I wholeheartedly agree with and praise them for moving on it. I do have one beef though. The upper ball joints on these are not a piece specific replacement, but should failure occur, and it will sooner or later, you will have to replace the entire upper control arm. The ball joint/ control arm are a combination unit and will have to be replaced as such, more than tripling the cost compared to being able to replace just the ball joint as a single component.

    All in all, way to go Ford motor company, the roar of complaint for so many years must have been deafening to cause you to dump the twin I-beam in favor of this wonderful new design. Now it must be equally as deafening from cheers of &quot;it's about time&quot;. Now let's do something about those upper ball joints.<br><br>
