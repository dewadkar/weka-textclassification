               I've owned my 1995 Contour for 3 years now and the problems have been minimal.  Even the newest 2000 contours are based on the same design as my Contour, so it goes without saying that looking at the performance of an older Contour can help the buyer decide if they'd like to buy a newer model.
   Put simply, I've had to do little to keep my Ford Contour running well over the years.  Not only does it run well, but the gas mileage is excellent, giving the driver 28-32 mpg in town and 33-38 mpg on the highway.  Often you'll see cars decrease in gas mileage over the years, but this is not true with the Ford Contour; it remains steady in its mpg.  In addition, the Ford Contour boasts some nice options, from the simple cup holders that fold away to a nice tape deck and/or cd player with excellent speakers.  The Ford Contour is loaded with options that you might find on more expensive vehicles, yet Ford keep the Contour's price low so that we can all afford it.
   The only downside to the Contour that I can see is some poor craftsmanship on some of the interior accessories, like the headrests which can break easily if the driver is not careful.  Also, the interior carpets can dirty easily, which is very noticeable since they are usually lighter colors.  Other than this, the Contour is an excellent vehicle!
