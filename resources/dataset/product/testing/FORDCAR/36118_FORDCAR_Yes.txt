            Go on, sit down and make yourself comfy, and safe n' sound. At first i was skeptical about the new Ford Focus. It seemed too good to be true&quot; so I just ignored it. When my friend bought one for her first car... i was blown away! I immediately fell in love with the fact that it is short person friendly. I loved the unique body design, those cat eye headlights are adorable. :] Not to mention i LOVED the CD player right away. This car is perfect for a small family. It can hold 5 persons in all. I love the back seats and how there are 3 &quot;shoulder&quot; seatbelts instead of just the stomach ones. Those stomach seatbelts can and will cut you in half if you get into a serious accident!

Now, let's talk about comfort. This car's seats are perfect. They don't suck you down so you can't see, and they aren't hard or the least bit uncomfortable. When the car drives you feel like you are sitting on a floating couch!

What about the price? Well, for being awarded so VERY many awards and safety features and all, (car of the year!) this car is cheap! Why blow all your money on a new lexus when this car is only 11,000-15,000 dollars! You couldn't ask for a better deal. I would like to buy one of these cars in the NEAR future.

All together, this car is a dream come true for me and I'm sure many other people.<br><br>
