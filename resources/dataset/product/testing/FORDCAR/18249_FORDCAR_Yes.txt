            I bought the Escort to have a &quot;new&quot; car, but didn't need anything fancy.  It has been reliable and efficient (28 mpg).  It only has 75,000 miles on it, but I use it every day to go to work or run short errands.  I have driven it on long drives (800 miles), which it is fine for, if a little noisy.

I have had only two repairs made:
* I had the air conditioning repaired.  The condenser had a leak.  I spent an extra $200 to have them convert it to the newer non-CFC refrigerant R-134A.  I figured if I every had the A/C serviced again, that investment would pay off.  Total bill was about $500.

* I had a tie-rod replaced in the front end.  Total cost was less than $200.  

I think I need to have the front end checked again, as I get a chattering vibration when I push towards 75 mph.  But it doesn�t seem to mind.

I have been rear-ended several times in this car without sustaining any damage, so I would judge it as sturdy and durable, too.  No rust, no squeaks, no falling apart trim or interior.  It has stayed in good shape.

At 6'3&quot;, the seats could use another notch-or-two back, but this car is much better than a Tempo from the same year (my knees hit the steering column on that one).  I have gotten used to the seats and they are comfortable.

As the mileage gets higher, I am starting to fear the timing belt or water pump failing.  My father has a 92 that both have been replaced on.  These are expensive to repair (August Consumer Reports says $500 for the water pump), but worthwhile investments.

Today, I couldn�t part with it.  I could only sell it for less than $2,000, but would need to spend $10,000 to get a car a little newer that I felt I could rely on.  College and high school students would do well with this car.<br><br>
