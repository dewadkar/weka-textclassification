            I just recently purchased my 1992 Ford Ranger XLT truck about 5 months ago.  So far I love it.  It has been great for hauling, and traveling.  I have taken several really comfortable road trips with absolutely no problems ( other than me getting lost ).  I highly recommend this truck to anyone who is looking for a truck with good gas mileage, reliability, good handling, etc...

My truck is an automatic, 6 cyl. rear wheel drive.  I get about 20 miles to the gallon highway, and just a little less for city.  have had no mechanical problems at all, especially considering that I bought it with only 18,000 miles on it.  It sat around for about 5 years in North Dakota.  The only problem with that is that the muffler had a small hole rust through the bottom,  no biggy though.  The bed is very easy to load and haul with, very convenient and very well sized at 6 feet.

My only complaint is that being rear wheel drive, I have minimal gripping power in snowy conditions even with added weight in the back.  But I guess that's what you get when you have no topper or tools.
