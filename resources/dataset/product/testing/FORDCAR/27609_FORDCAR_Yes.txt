            I recently had a chance to test drive a friend's new Ford Escape, and I have the following reactions:

Plusses:
- The V6 in the model I drove (loaded) is powerful!  Impressed for the price.
- Drives like a car.  I own an Explorer, and this is a definite good thing (the Explorer drives like a truck).
- Relatively inexpensive.
- Looks alot like a Jeep Grand Cherokee, and a little like an Explorer.

Minuses:
- Not an off road vehicle, compared to other SUVs.
- Lots of competition.  RAV4, to name one of many.
- The escape is currently very popular, which will cost you if you choose to buy it.

Overall, it is new, exciting, and fun, so it is worth it.  Since it is so popular, you should consider some of the competitors when you shop.<br><br>
