                                        Dear car driver, 
                                        I come to you to tell you about the Ford Explorer. It is awesome. Can you say
                                        &quot; a fine piece of American craftmanship&quot;. It's time we actually considered that
                                        &quot;made in the USA&quot; sticker. There are a plethura of reasons to buy a Ford
                                        Explorer. It looks great. It is amazingly comfortable. It handles very well, and
                                        can roll over most other cars on the road. It is great for family vacations, with
                                        its spacious interior. But it is also more than suitable for a night on the town.
                                        Buyng a Ford is something you can feel good about and it is an itelligent
                                        investment. Go out and but one!!!!!!<br><br>
