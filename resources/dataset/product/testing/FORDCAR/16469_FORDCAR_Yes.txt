            I bought my Ford Ranger XLT new in 1996 and have had no major problems with it since it was purchased.  For 4 years I have only had to take it in to the dealer 1 time for a replacement of an emissions part that malfunctioned.  It did not cause any noticeable problem except activating the &quot;Check Engine&quot; light.  It was fixed FREE of charge due to the 3yr. bumper-to-bumper warranty.
Even after 4 yrs. I still get the same gas mileage of 19 - 20 miles per gallon the ranger has an efficient A/C that is just as cold as it was new.
My Ranger is a standard transmision and it shifts quite smoothly.
The only complaint I have about the Ranger is the seats.  My back starts aching after about a 3 - 4 hour drive.
I feel safe in the Ford Ranger and believe with the periodic, preventative maintenance it will last for a good 150,000+ miles.
