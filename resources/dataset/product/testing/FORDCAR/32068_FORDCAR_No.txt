            I purchased the Ford Explorer for its styling, space and published reports
about the excellent performance.

I love the safety aspects of the vehicle and I hate the current performance of the vehicle (just crossed 50,000 miles).

The vehicle drives like a 10 year old truck ready to stop any minute.

The vehicle performed satisfactorily till about 48,000 miles when problems started:  1. had to replace the engine thermostat, main gasket and water pump;  2. had to replace the exhaust sensor  3. the transmission appears to be slipping (although the dealer says it is OK) and it is giving 14 miles per gallon.

The above repairs are in addition to the normal maintenance done on the vehicle like:  1. replace battery, 2. replace all 4 tires and align wheels
3. replace front and back brake pads and turn rotor.<br><br>
