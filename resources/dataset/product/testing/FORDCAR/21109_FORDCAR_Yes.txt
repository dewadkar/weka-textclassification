            Owning a ford windstar myself, i feel it is a wonderful minivan.  It is roomy, and has a very comfortable feel.  My family has always invested in ford minivans and thinks that beyond a doubt, the windstar is the best of them all!  Beyond space concerns, the sound system is very good, and provides a professional stereo effect.  It has many other features, too many of which to mention right here, but i do recommend this fine car for research.  The Ford website should provide all this info.  This minivan is perfect for entertaining children, carrying many objects and has impressive handling for a heavy car such as it is.  It ranges in usefullness from soccer mom care and grocery buying to massive vacation packing to transporting furniture.  I honestly do not know what i would do with such a minivan; it is undeniably a needed part of my life.<br><br>
