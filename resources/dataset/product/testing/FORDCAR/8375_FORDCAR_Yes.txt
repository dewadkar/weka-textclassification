            In 1992 I bought my daughter a new Ford Explorer with a promise from her that I drive it until she started college a year later.  When she started to college she took the Explorer with her and I drove another car.  She drove the Explorer until 1999 when she purchased a 1999 Ford Mustang.  I sold the car I was driving at the time and took back the Explorer.  So you can see why I entitled this &quot;Recycled Explorer&quot;.

We had problems with vibrations from the beginning, which I understand was a problem with most 1992 Explorers.  The dealer from which I bought the car tried to correct this problem by installing shims.  That didn't work and I've been told that they should not have done this.  This is the only major complaint we've had with the car.  Obviously, it was not so big a deal that we sold the vehicle.  It now has 103,000 miles on and still going strong.  We have had to replace the anti-lock brake system and I recently had the rotors replaced, but the rotors are a part of wear and tear that you would normally expect.
