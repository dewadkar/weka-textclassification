            we purchased our 1995 explorer after having our first child.the explorer came very highly recommended from other friends that have them also. we fill very safe carrying our precious cargo around in this. my husband also works at the mountain and needed transportation that he could count on getting him up and down the mountain. He say's the the explorer seems to get around very well in all types of weather conditions. It has plenty of room for 5 people and still room for the dogs in back. we have been lucky so far and only had to do the usual maintenance work on it.this vehicle would work very well for a family or even a single person looking for a suv with lots of room and the luxury of a car.the only down fall we have found is that it not the most economical but i guess that should be expected for a suv.
