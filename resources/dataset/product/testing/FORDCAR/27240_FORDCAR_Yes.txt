            	I was moving across the country and needed a car with air conditioning.  I had a base model Escort without AC, and loved it, so I wanted to stay in the Ford family.  I knew I wanted a four door, but nothing huge.  I drove the Ford Taurus, Focus ZX3, Focus sedan and station wagon models.  I found the Focus sedan to be the right choice for me. 
	I had the car for all of a month before I drove it from Rhode Island to Arizona.  The trip took three days and cost less than $300 in gas.  If that isn�t an argument for great gas mileage, I don�t know what is.  I was able to drive for long stretches of time without feeling cramped or uncomfortable.  I especially like that fact that the driver�s seat can be raised or lowered depending on your needs.  There are fewer blind spots in the Focus than in the Escort, and the rear window is huge.  
	I bought the five speed over the automatic, and it handles beautifully.  The gears are very easy, first is a little short, but that�s a relatively minor problem.  I�ve driven 5 speed Volkswagens before, and the handling is very similar.  It drives like a more expensive car, rather than an economy sedan.  
	The few problems I�ve had with the car are minor annoyances.  The detachable faceplate on the radio tends to loosen up, and turn the radio off while driving.  The cup holders are a little small, so a 20oz. soda bottle gets stuck.  And then there�s the ultra-annoying seatbelt alarm.  It goes off about a minute after the car is turned on and driving begins, if the driver doesn�t put on their seatbelt.  It�s loud and obnoxious.  I haven�t yet figured out how to disconnect it.  The adjustable height of the seatbelts though makes them very comfortable, they don�t dig into my neck like in other cars.
