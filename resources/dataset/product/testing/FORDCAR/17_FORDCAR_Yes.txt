            I was shopping for a new car around the end of 1999.  The new models were out, and I was in the market for a passenger sedan.  With a baby seat, and need for cargo room, a midsize or larger was what I needed.  Although the 2000 models were out, I opted for a 1999 Ford Taurus.  I have not regretted it a bit!

The Taurus has a classic body style, that gives it the look and feel of a European sedan.  I prefer the 1999 style to the new 2000 look, because the '99 looks more polished to me.  The car is a great performer, with plenty of room for my family.  We got a Taurus SE, with leather and CD player.  The V6 engine has plenty of power, and gets good gas mileage (around 26 highway).  There is no road noise whatsoever.  The seats are very comfortable, both front and back.  Combine that with the smooth ride, and the Taurus is great for long trips.  I like the AC vent in the back seat as well; that makes it much easier to keep back seat passengers comfortable.  

The best part of this car is that I got a great deal.  Since the 2000s were out, and they wanted to push the 1999s off the lot, I was able to pick this car up at invoice less a $1,500 dealer rebate.  By doing this, I got a lot more car for my money.  Ford Credit has very competitive rates, and you can find Ford dealers for service anywhere in the country.  The 1999 Taurus is a car that you can (literally) purchase, and not worry about for a long time!  <br><br>
