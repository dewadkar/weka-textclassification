            I bought my Excursion specifically to tow my 7000+ lb. 31-foot-long camper.  With the V-10 6.8L engine installed, this truck does a fantastic job of towing safely at highway speeds and up hills, plus there is plenty of room for the three kids, the dog, and all the "stuff" my wife and I take along.

I feel safe on the interstate, with a smooth ride and little wind turbulence from passing trucks.  The 44-gallon gas tank means plenty of time, despite the relatively poor gas mileage, between fill-ups.

The inside is beautiful, with leather seating for 8 full-sized adults.  The second row seats slide up, making it easy for kids and adults alike to climb into the third row.  There is a great stereo system, 5 power ports, and a huge cargo space behind the third seat.  The rear cargo area is accessed by a tri-fold door with a fold-up window and "dutch" doors which swing apart.  Both front captain's seats have 6-way power adjustments.  The climate control system is automatic; just set the desired temperature.  The rear heat/air is quite adequate for the task and keeps even the back seat passengers comfortable.

I have seen bad reviews on this vehicle, mostly from people who haven't driven it or are just generally critical of large SUVs.  My response is that this vehicle is designed to haul big things and carry lots of people.  Do not buy it if you just want to commute to work or run errands around town.  Do not buy it if you expect 30 MPG; I'm getting around 11-12 MPG.  Do not buy it if you expect a very smooth carlike ride; it's basically a TRUCK built on a truck frame.

But if you have a large camper or boat and you need lots of cargo space, you should consider the Excursion--it's a fantastic tow vehicle.
