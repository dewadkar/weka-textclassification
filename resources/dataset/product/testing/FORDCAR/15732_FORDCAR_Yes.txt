            My husband and I bought a '95 Windstar back in June of this year due to our family growing.  We knew we needed a good family vehicle and because I was experienced with Windstars (my parents have two of them), I knew they were great and reliable.  We enjoy the accessibility we have to getting our toddler son in and out and with another on the way, accessibility is #1.  The van rides and drives like a car and the seats are very comfortable.  Even removing and changing and back seats is quick and easy.  The bench seat is a bit heavy, but my husband manages to do it by himself.  We thought about purchasing a SUV, but after test-driving many of them, I decided they were too big and bulky for me to park and drive on a daily basis.  The Windstar is so easy to handle and parking is a breeze.  The turning radius on our van a little lacking, but my parent's vans (which are newer models) have a great radius.  We love the roominess of our Windstar and are thinking of trading it in for the 2000 model in the next few months as we really like the two sliding doors as opposed to our one on the passenger side.  I think this is a wonderful vehicle for all types of people, but especially those with families.  With all the options out today, you are sure to find one to satisfy your needs.<br><br>
