            I start with my deepest sympathy in regards to Rodeim.  How I met Rodeim was because of a comment I left regarding one of his reviews and he had been one of my best teachers here at Epinions since.  I will truly miss him and his great advice.

Many included in the write off have not included their review.  We only have one more day.

This is one of my weakest areas to write a review, but I will do my best.  Please if you read this just rate it fairly.  It is ok if I get all NH as long as it is being counted. Ok, Rodiem this is for you, please don't be to hard on me, you know cars are the pits for me.    
   
Ford Tarus GLX 1995

The Tarus started as a company car and when the lease was up we had the option to purchase it and we did for 8,000.

It has a more boxy look compared to the newer models.
The Tarus is a four door all power automatic vehicle.  It has room to grow, the back and front seats are cloth and spacious with arm rests in the center.  There is room for 2 car seats in the back and one person.  Floor space is big, my husband is 6ft 2in and he doesn't complain in this car.  That is a good sign.

The front driver side seat is adjustable and will accommodate any size person and the steering wheel is adjustable too. This car has 2 sets of panel buttons one right next to the steering wheel and right around the radio area.  You can turn the radio on seek, volume and power without taking your hand off the steering wheel.  

Features:
Cruise Control, Radio, Cassette Deck, Rear Defroster, automatic side view mirror adjusters, automatic windows auto door locks on the driver door panel, air bags, pop latch for the hood, truck and gas cap.  

On the door panels of the front seats are plastic pockets to store sunglasses, paper, pencil, tapes.  There is a 2 cup tray, change holder, lighter, ashtray and large glove compartment. 

The trunk is huge, the tire, jack and tools are all located in the back screwed to the top of the trunk hull providing a lot of extra room.  I can fit a stroller, a few bags of groceries and my brief case and probably a kid back there.
 
General maintenance was performed the entire time we have owned the car and we had no major problems the first 5 years of driving the car in 2000 we blew a head gasket and was having the car looked at.  While the car was being evaluated we received a recall letter and all costs were covered by Ford.  Now we have a new engine.  

Up until the blown head gasket, the Tarus had all original parts.  Now since July of 2000, The engine has been replaced, motor mounts, air conditioner and new muffler.  Nothing more than purchasing new tires, oil changes and tune ups till that point.  I must say it is a durable and reliable car.

It handles great in the snow and it has some power.  We were at a high school football game and it rained the whole time.  The parking attendants had people parking in a grassy lot.  When the game was over many people were stuck.  My husband pooled out 3 or four other cars with his Tarus before the tow trucks got there.  He was covered in mud, but was having a blast doing it and save a few people a few bucks in the process.
    
The car has always runs smooth, is comfortable for long trips and you do have to watch the speed odometer it is very easy to speed in this car.  You can not tell if you are doing 80 or 65 unlike other cars I drive, I really have to use cruise or keep checking my speed.

The Tarus has always gotten great gas mileage, right now I think around 20 miles per gallon and it can sit on empty forever before you really have to stop and get gas.  When I tell people about the gas mileage they don't believe me, it is true.        

I never suggest buying used cars, If you are buying a used car this would be one I would suggest you check out.  It is a solid car at a reasonable price.

I feel, I should continue writing.  

Rodiem was a lengthy and good writer and I do not compare myself to his caliber.  

All you readers and raters - Rev up those hits for Rodiem.  


So Long my dear friend from Epinions.
