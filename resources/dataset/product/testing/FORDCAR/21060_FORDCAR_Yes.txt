            I never thought I'd be driving a minivan.  A mustang convertible has always been my dream car and a minivan is about as far away from a Mustang as you can get.  Or, so you'd think!!!  I am a huge fan of my 1999 Ford Windstar!!!  This vehicle has some get up and go that I never expected it to have.  It drives like a car; which was a switch from most of the minivans I had test driven.  It rides smooth and the V6 engine gives you all the pick up that you'll need.  

We got our Minivan in June and planned on doing a lot of traveling with it.  My family is spread across the country and plane tickets get really expensive - very quickly!  So....we knew that we needed something comfortable and reliable that had a little room to move around.  This van has not disappointed us once in the 11,300 miles we've driven it thus far.  It's been to the tops of mountains, driven through snow, down into the heat of the deep south and it just keeps going!  I love the way it handles and the comfort of it.  I love the roominess and the ease with which the seats fold down and come out.  (Although they are quite heavy!) I love the tinted rear windows and the separate temperature control system for the rear of the van.  The one thing this van has that I never thought we'd use that often is the cd player.  Boy, was I wrong!  I absolutely love being able to listen to cd's in the van.  The other feature this van has that we love is 4 doors.  It is wonderful to be able to access the back from both sides.

There are a few downsides to this van.  One is the fact that ours did not come equipped with keyless remote.  We had that on our Taurus and I became very spoiled!  I miss it tremendously and may someday pay to have it put in.  The other downside is the low gas mileage.  We average about 19 miles to the gallon - which is a huge switch from the Taurus we drove previously.  

I would recommend this van to families that travel a lot or that have a lot to haul around.  It is very comfortable and affordable.<br><br>
