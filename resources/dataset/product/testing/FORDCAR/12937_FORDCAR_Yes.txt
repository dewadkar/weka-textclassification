            I bought my 2002 Windstar SEL minivan simply because of the great deal I got.  I traded my 2000 Toyota Avalon due to our growing family.  My sister has had a Windstar SE since 1999, and has no problems whatsoever.  She loves it, so I called the dealer that sold her the van. 
I already had a deposit down (which I got refunded)on a MAZDA MPV ES.  (I still like some of the features on the MAZDA better, but...I got much more of a van for the money by way of comparing both vehicles TOP of the line features) 
The van has dual power doors, a TV/VCR  system rebated to $0 cost.  It has leather, two-tone paint, alloy wheels, low pressure tire system, ABS, electronic systems check (for everything from washer fluid to light bulbs), a compass, trip computer, etc, etc.  It's got everything.  The payments are great with the special financing they have going now (buying the van for the same money I leased the Toyota).
So far, no squeeks, no rattles, very comfortable, nice ride.  The kids and wife love it.  The rear seat is heavy, but how many times are you going to take the thing in and out of your van to begin with?  It's a minivan, not a truck, and the infrequent number of times that you really need to move the seat(s) hardly equates to a reason to pick one van over another.
The only problem may be that is can get too quiet and comfortable, so much so that I want to take a nap on long freeway drives.  More coffee please. 

As a final note, my sister loved my new van so much, she went up two days later, and traded her 1999 Windstar SE for the 2002 SEL that I bought.  She's sold on it...so am I.
