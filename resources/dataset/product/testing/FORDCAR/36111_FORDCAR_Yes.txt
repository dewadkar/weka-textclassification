            My husband and I test drove this vehicle on Memorial Day weekend. We also drove a Toyota ECHO.  We bought the Echo, partly because of Toyota's reputation, partly because I liked the Echo better. 

The car we drove had the Zetec engine.  It was peppy enough and the car took corners well.  The car we drove had 5,000 plus miles on it.  We had to stop to put fuel in it and noticed the smell of burning oil coming from the engine compartment.  We opened the hood, but couldn't find the leak; however, after a 30 minute test drive the odor was still there.

Visibility forward and sideways is good.  Rear visibility is not-so-good for backing up.  Seats were fairly comfortable, but I did not like the way my foot was positioned on the pedals.  Brakes worked fine in a panic stop.  The trunk has lots of space.  I sat in the back seat in a 3 Dr.  It was very difficult getting in and out, so I recommend that if you are carrying passengers in the rear, buy a 4-door.  Also even though it brings up the price of the car, get the Zetec engine.

Probably a decent car for the money.  If you think you're buying American, most of the one's we looked at were built in Mexico.
