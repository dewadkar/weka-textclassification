            The Ford Contour is a great value for the money. Even with the base engine, this little sedan has more than enough get up and go. I would suggest the 5 speed, as opposed to the automatic, so you have more control over the power needed. For under $15,000 ( and with rebates and dealer discounts the price can be WAY under!) you get plenty of room for a compact and comfortable seating for 4 adults. 

Although it 's styling isn't anything out of the ordinary, it has pleasing lines and good aerodynamics. Ford seems to take extra care in keeping their customers satisfied, as I always am contacted by the company when my car is in for service, to see if I was taken care of properly. 

My only complaint is the cup holders in the console. They don't hold much of anything securely, and I'm not quite sure what the engineers used to base them on. But after more than 20,000 miles of trouble-free driving, that is a testament to the car's reliability. You better hurry and snag a Contour soon, as I've heard they will stop making them, now that the Focus has been introduced.<br><br>
