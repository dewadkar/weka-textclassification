<TEXT>
            Im writing about my sisters 1993 Ford Probe.  She just recently bought this car for College, and I must say, I dont know why Ford Discontinued them.  Well, there still around, but are known as the ZX2, instead of the Probe.  Heres the lowdown on my vehicle....

Engine-
  My sisters car is the SE, equipped with the 2.0 ztec engine (shared with the ZX2), its very quite, and very zippy at the same time.  I have seen people write about how there 4 cylanders are not peppy, this one sure is.  It can easily beat many of the competition. I walked right away from my parents 6 Cylander Oldsmobile Intrigue the other day.  

Style-
  That one word discribes this whole car.  The outside is sporty, although it sits very low to the ground  (so watch out for dips).  The inside is beautifuly laid out with 2 Sport Bucket Seats in the front, the Shifter on the floor, and a sporty rear seat that folds down thus enabling lots of storage.

Gas Milage- 
   I average around 36mpg and even more on good days.
