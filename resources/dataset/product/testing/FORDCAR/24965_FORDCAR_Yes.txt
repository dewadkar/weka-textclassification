            I purchased a '99 Mustang on a whim on September 14, 1999.  This is the single most fun I have had since I first got my license when I turned 16.  It is easy to handle, even being a five-speed, for those of you who don't drive stick shift.  This car has plenty of get up and go with out the V8 engine.  I had looked into Mustangs prior to ever being serious about getting one.  I am new to the work force and I have found that Ford in general is a wonderful company to deal with when it comes to understanding the price range of someone who is just starting out.  For the look of a sports car, not to mention the speed of one, I doubt you can find a more reliable warranty, or engine to suit your needs.  At this point, for my life, I have found nothing that I would change about my car.  It came standard with a solid sound system and CD player, power everything and keyless entry.  The anti-theft system is worth just hearing about and they even provide certain road side amenities that are worth looking into.  Enjoy the ride!!!<br><br>
