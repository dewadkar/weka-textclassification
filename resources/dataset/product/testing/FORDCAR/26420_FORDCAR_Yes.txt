            I did not want a minivan.  I had a very negative mind-set against minivans and the people who drove them.  They mostly seemed to be crazy women who cut you off and gave you dirty looks.  I did not want to be one of them.  Now I am.  I am a minivan mama.  We bought one because my husband wanted one.  He's a big guy, and had trouble getting in and out of my little car (he has a pickup he uses for himself).  So finally one weekend we went to price used minivans, and we found our 1996 Ford Windstar.  I love it!!  It's a lot of fun to drive, not nearly as difficult to get used to as I thought.  It really is not very different from driving a car.  It rides very smoothly, and gets decent gas mileage.  Our young daughter loves it because she sits up high enough to see everything around us.  We took it on vacation with us and it easily fit all the stuff we took with us, and I do NOT travel lightly.  It has good features, air conditioning, power windows, mirrors, locks, and a good stereo system.  The only thing I would say against it is it should have some sort of mechanism on the sliding door to lock/unlock the rest of the car doors.  My husband was also impressed with its safety record. <br><br>
