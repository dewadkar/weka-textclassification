            I have now driven my Eddie Bauer Expedition for over one year and 25,000 miles. I have mostly good experiences with the Ford sport utility. It has had no serious problems but a few minor glitches. Mechanically the Expedition has been problem free. The minor problems consisted of the weather stripping around the back door occasionally comes loose and has to be pushed back in place and the heat/ac vent over the back seat has a tendency to fall out. Nothing major but a $30,000 SUV should be finished a little better.
The ride is very comfortable and reasonably quiet for a SUV. The sound system is above average and the heat/ac system works very well. Fuel economy is about 16mpg average combining city (13mpg) and highway (19).
Overall the Expedition has been a pleasure to own and operate. I would recommend the Expedition to anyone interested in something that large, comfortable and safe family transportation.
