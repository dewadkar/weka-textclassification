            I WAS so excited when we bought our used, Ford Explorer. Until it because the money pit. We've spent a fortune on maint. and repairs. Our dealer was a jerk who all the while told you what a deal he was giving you squeezed a little more lemon into the deal. If you do decide to buy used, make sure the vehicle was properly maintained by the previous owner. The explorer itself is very convenient and roomy. Great for toting kids, car seats, Sam's Club shopping sprees, etc. But do yourself and your wallet a favor and either buy new or well maintained. Don't get stuck (like I did) with a vehicle that needs everything replaced.<br><br>
