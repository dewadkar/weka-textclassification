            My wife leased a 1999 Ford explorer January 1999.
It has been a nightmare ever since.
First problem was with the transmission, It started leaking 1 month after we got it. They decided a new seal was in order. It went back to the shop a total of three times before they figured that the transmission was defective. Then came the recalls, one for the cruise control then the front hood latch then for a defective windshield washer which would come on intermittently. To this day we are still having problems with it.
Now the airbag light stays on and the rear windshield washer refuses to work. we had another problem with the check engine light.

This is our first Ford vehicle and quite possibly our last.

In the early day Fords were ok, but now the quality has suffered.
