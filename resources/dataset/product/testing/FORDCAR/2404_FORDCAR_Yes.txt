            I drove a friend�s 96 power stroke diesel super cab F150 and I was very impressed!  My own cars have always been compacts since I really have no need to haul stuff.  Therefore this comparison comes from a guy used to Celicas, 240sx, MR2, etc.  The exterior of the truck is very handsome.  Ford kept it simple and neat.  There isn�t a ton of cheap chrome and trim all over the place.  The design is bold and big.  Inside the truck is extremely spacious.  I imagine even adults could sit in the rear seat and not be completely miserable.  The front seats could be better, but they are acceptable.  A neat feature they have is an air filled bladder in the lumbar area that is power operated.  You can make the seat has soft or as firm as you like.  All controls and gauges are large and easy to see and use.  The speaker covers are wonderfully attractive.  They have stretched fabric covering that is much like what is found in luxury brands like Lexus and Acura.  

Ford was really smart to make the radio a DIN size.  For you folks that aren�t too much into radios let me just say that having a DIN size is awesome because you get the freedom to change out your radio very easily.  The stock ford unit is pretty whimpy.  This particular truck had an after market Alpine CD that rocked.  Driving the truck is a great experience in light traffic.  The gurgle of the engine sounds tough and people in small cars tend to move over when they see this thing in their rearview as it�s screaming, �get out of my way�.  

I say the drive is pleasant in light traffic because the shifter (this one had a 5 speed) is very sloppy.  Gears are easily missed and the clutch pedal being so firm does not help things.  I have driven cars with less firm brake pedals!  Ford should have added more power assist to the clutch and make it light touch.  Your left leg will get a workout if you have to creep along in traffic.  However, if you drive in normal conditions and avoid gridlock, this is not much of an issue.  City buyers should get the auto.  All in all it�s a truck I really like.  I actually think it looks better than the replacement body style ford released in 97.    Oh and it has a gooseneck trailer hitch in the bed!
