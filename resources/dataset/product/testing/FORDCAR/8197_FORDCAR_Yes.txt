            After reading the review basically bashing this ride, I had to write one of my own.  I drove a 1999 Eddie Bauer with  the 5.4L engine for the last 3 years, and let me tell you, a 100% change for the better in the new 2003.  I've driven the '03 for about a month now, logged over 2000 miles and am still impressed by its handling, ride comfort, low noise and most of all versatile seating arrangement.  Having 4 children between the ages of 7 and 16, my wife and I are constantly on the go.  It was always a decision in the Old Expedition, whether to take out the back seat or leave it in for more bodies.  Not a problem any more!!. My back is saved!!.  I can flip each of the 3 2nd row seats independently, and power fold the 3rd row seat into two different sections.  I can carry 6 people and still fit almost an entire truck beds worth of groceries, sporting equipment and home improvement goods.  No longer is the steering sub-standard.  The new steering box is 100% improved, much tighter and responsive.  The third row seat actually fits someone now!.  Being 6'1" tall, I could never ride back there in my '99, but now, I not only ride back there, but I can also take in a DVD (widescreen) while we're driving.  Whoever says this SUV is not worth the money is full of S---.  It has plenty of Torque, can pull a large boat and then some, all while hauling a bunch of people.  Personally, I thought pricing was among the better values.  Ford held the pricing for the Expedition from Last Year.  A new, Fully Loaded Eddie Bauer with DVD, Safety Canopy, Heated (and Cooled) Seats, Power Fold Rear Seat and Rear Entertainment system costs only about 37k on carsdirect.com.  You can find better deals than that (I did), but that's a good average.  Compare that to any Yukon, Yukon XL, Tahoe, Suburban etc.  It is AT LEAST 3k less for far more functionality.  If you have problems with the Excursion or Suburban fitting into your garage, try this out.  I could go on-and-on about this, the ride, the looks, but I emplore you to try this vehicle before listening to someone who just wants to bash it.
