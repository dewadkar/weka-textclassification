            As the owner of a transportation company utilizing a many vehicles in the past 5 years I highly recommend the Ford 15 Passenger Vans.  I have had 3 and compared to the Dodges (See poor review on those beasts) these vans are excellent investments.  They are the chosen workhorse of the transportation industry in Florida. You can see thousands of them on the road in Orlando and nearly all the transportation companies are using them instead of the Dodges now.

They ride like a dream, everything works as supposed to, rarely falling apart. The drivers seat is very kind to your back. (I log at least 40 hours a week behind the wheel)  Properly maintained this vehicle can provide reliable transportation past 200,000 miles.  The ride is excellent with a car like suspension, unlike the rough truck ride of the Chrysler vans.   The AC is icy cold and a good distribuiton system in with seperate rear air controller. Interior has stood up well to the heavy traffic (lots of kids) Some problems with the seatlbelts falling thru seats and the seat covers staying on properly, but nothing major. My oldest van is a 95 and had almost 200,000 miles on it.  Very few major repairs, again NOTHING like the Dodges which I have lost a fortune on.

I was very skeptical when I first opened this business of FORD's (Fix Or Repair Daily, or Found On Road Dead) but these vehicles have really proven to be well made workhorses and have become the vehicle of choice for most fleet transportation companies.

For personal use large families can't beat it.  (I put each of my 3 kids in their own seat on long trips so they can sleep and not bug each other) <br><br>
