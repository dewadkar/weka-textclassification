            I purchased a 2000 Ford Focus ZTS six months ago.  I loved it then, and I still do.  I have actually come to enjoy it more now than the first time I drove it.

At first, sitting in the Focus felt a little odd because the car is a few inches taller than most of it peers, but now, after extensive driving, I'm very happy for the high seat position.  It makes it very easy to get in and out of.  You do not have to climb down to get in and climb up to get out, like you do in other smaller cars.

The stereo is wonderful.  The CD player has many interesting features that I didn't even know about when i bought the car.  It adjusts the volume to compensate for higher speeds, and it will play for one hour when the key is not in the ignition, with this option you don't have to put up with that horrible beeping while your cleaning your car.

The thing I enjoy most about my Focus is the fact that it is very unique and stylish.  I love the feeling I get driving down the street in a beautiful car.  Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.
