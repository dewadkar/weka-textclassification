            I purchased my first Ford Explorer because I liked the way it looked and it gave me the ability to see well in traffic.  I am now leasing my Explorers every two years and plan to continue doing so.  I love the handling, the height which gives me the ability to see in traffic, the lights that come on automatically when needed, the side mirrors that light up when you unlock the door with the remote, and the power that can be called on to get me out of a tight spot.  The only thing I don't like about an Explorer is the fact that many people are driving them and it can be very confusing when you return to a parking lot.  I think anyone interested in comfort, dependability, a great handling would appreciate this car.  Those people who are intimidated by a large vehicle should stay away; even though it is extremely easy to handle<br><br>
