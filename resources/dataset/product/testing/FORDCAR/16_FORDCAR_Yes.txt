            I recently purchased a used 1999 Ford Taurus.  With 33,000 miles, the car runs incredibly.  The V6 engine gives a lot of energy on the road for a smooth ride, and all of the options like moon roof, CD player, leather seats, and power seats make it enjoyable to drive.  I have not had any trouble with any of the options nor more importantly the engine.

The look of the 1999 Taurus is smooth, rounded, and fun.  The 2000 Tauruses have changed the look of the tail of the car.  They are a bit squarer, but I am fond of the rounded look of the 1999 Taurus.  

You can be the judge though.  Shop and compare the Taurus.  Get behind the wheel and you might get hooked like me.<br><br>
