            I bought my 1993 Ford Thunderbird back in 1992.  It was silver with black tinted windows, and it drove like a dream.

When it wasn't snowing or raining, that is.

I had no mechanical problems to speak of, aside from replacing the alternator a couple of times.  I think that was my own fault - I had a very beefed up stereo system put into it, and I did not get a separate battery for it, so I think that served to be an incredible drain on my battery and alternator.

This sounds silly, but I loved how fast my windows rolled up and down!!  I've never had another car since that had such zooming windows!! 

It was the most comfortable car to drive - I had been up and back to Maine a few times and it seemed like nothing.  It never broke down on me, it always started right away.  

This model year T-Bird had some serious brake issues, however.  I, luckily, had replaced my brakes at a place that offered "lifetime replacements".  Shame on them, because I became on a first-name basis with the people at National Tire & Battery.  

I found my interior (half leather, half cloth) to be extremely durable.  I was not always easy on my car as far as throwing things in the back and pulling them back out again, but I never, ever got a tear in my interior cloth.  

I was meticulous in my maintenance of this car.  Oil changes every 3,000, tune ups, etc...and it never ever gave me any problems (aside from the alternator).  

I live in New England, so to someone around here, I would never recommend this car.  Even when it sprinkled out, I was all over the road.  Nevermind in the snow - The snow was my only reason for ever getting rid of this car.
