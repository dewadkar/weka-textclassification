            I bought a 95 Ford Escort in high school. It is a great buy. I bought it because it was not a really small car and that it had some weight to it for safety purposes. I did not need a really big car but I did not want a small car either. 

I had my car for four years and had no problems with it. I kept it maintained regularly and it ran like new. 

The exterior of the car is really cute. I have seen many Escorts on the road and I think it is a popular car.

The interior of the Escort is nice too. The seats are comfortable and there is plenty of room for short people. The back seat is a little small but, if you are a small family, then there is plenty of room. 

When I got married and had my first child, there was plenty of room for the car seat in the middle. The downfall of having the car seat in the middle was that you could not fit another adult comfortably in the back seat.

The trunk of the Escort is one of the largest I have seen in a small car and we always had plenty of stuff to put back there.

The ride of the Escort is okay for a small car. It is a noisy ride when you are on the highway. It is also kind of bumpy when the road is not smooth.

The Ford Escort is an economical car and has a good track record. I do not recommend it for a family of more than three. It is also not a good car for tall people.<br><br>
