            This is a nice van, We recently purchased one for our Company in 

california. Its not the average company Van, Its sleek new design is 

really sweet. There are five models,E-150, E-250, E-250 Extended, E-350 

S/D and E-350 S/D Extended. Seating Capacity can become a real draw back 

while only holding 2 People. The most common model E350 S/D gets 12/17 

Miles to the gallon. They drive like a car. Most people have said that 

they do not like to drive Vans becasue Vans are to high up from the 

ground or to big, to hard to see other cars. Ford has made this easier by 

builind the van on a truck Chasie. You can also get a Crew Bench, which 

is nothing more then a second bench added to the back of the van. (Highly 

Recommend)There are six different engines available including the 5.4L 

Natural Gas, 7.3L Turbo Diesel and 6.8L V8 Engine. This van would make a 

great company Van for any Company. You can live in the seats they are so 

nice once your in one you will never want to give it up.<br><br>
