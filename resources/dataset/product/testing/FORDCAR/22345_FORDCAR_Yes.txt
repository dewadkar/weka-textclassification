            My dear husband wrecked my beloved Camry this summer and we started the dreaded &quot;car search&quot;!  Being the researcher that I am, I had two three-ring binders filled with information about my favorite vehicles.  I narrowed the choices to:  Jeep Grand Cherokee, Mercury Mountaineer and a Toyota Sienna minivan.

We drove the Mountaineer first.  It was so very small and drove worse than my Dad's 1970+ pickup.  

The Grand Cherokee drove like a dream, but I was reserved about buying a Chrysler product.

A friend from church just started at the local Ford dealership so we went by, mainly just to say we did and I caught a glimpse of the Expedition.  I was in love!  I convinced my husband to take it for a test drive, just for grins!  I was sitting in the backseat and could see his face in the rear-view mirror....pure joy was radiating from his eyes.  We left without even looking in the direction of another vehicle.

I had to throw away all the research I had done and start anew with Expedition in the lead.

We made our decision after driving it 2 more times.  I was afraid that it was &quot;too much&quot; car for me.  When test driving, I always took the vehicle to a crowded parking lot and practiced getting it in a crowded spot.  The Expedition was the easiest I found.  

I love how safe I feel in such a large vehicle, the handling and cornering ease, and the stylish looks.  It's the perfect family vehicle and even though we had to wait 8+ weeks to receive our ordered Expedition, it was the worth the wait and more.<br><br>
