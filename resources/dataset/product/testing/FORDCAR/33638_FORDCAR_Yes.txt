            If you need reliable, low maintenance and fuel-efficient vehicle, Ford Escort provides all these qualities. I rented 1998 Ford Escort LX Automatic for several weeks and it was trouble-free and very fuel-efficient.

The newer models have platinum tipped spark plugs that allow increase the interval between tune-ups to 100,000 miles. Consumer Reports magazine says that the car is also reliable. 

Fuel economy is great and the light accelerator pedal creates the illusion of very powerful engine under the hood (old Detroit trick) and makes the car �jumpy�.

Why <b>"illusion"</b>? Well, on the city streets the acceleration is quick, but on the freeway the car (LX trim with 2L 110 hp engine) slows to a crawl going uphill, so you have to downshift.

The automatic transmission does not understand the fact that the car is slowing to a crawl, even with fully depressed gas pedal, so you have to downshift manually.

It's surprising to me because the car is significantly lighter (2500 vs. 3000 lbs.) than my 12-years old VOLVO 740GLE (2.4L 114 hp) and thus has a better power/weight ratio. But VOLVO accelerates uphill in any gear. It doesn�t seem that gearing is radically different, probably the engine has low torque at midrange RPMs.

Unfortunately the first thing you notice is <b>engine noise</b> and that there is no sufficient leg room. The interior looks cheap (but the car is priced accordingly), however the control layout is smart. The A/C works fine, but on couple of occasions I had problems with window fogging.

I cannot tell you much about the car's radio, since I didn't use it much.

Another thing to consider � small cars are less safe in collisions, mid-size cars are far superior. However, the Escort was rated �Acceptable�, which is better than most competitors. The fuel economy was very good (I didn�t measure the exact number though), Ford claims 25 MPG city / 34 highway.

So if you want basic transportation - you can't go wrong with Escort.
