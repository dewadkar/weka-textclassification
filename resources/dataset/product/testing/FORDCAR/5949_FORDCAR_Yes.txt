            Before I bought the Expedition, I had a really cute Toyota Rav 4. I miss that vehicle as it was much easier to maneuver and park. But, with my family growing I needed something bigger. The other things I DON'T like about my Expedition is the gas mileage and the yucky stale smell that comes through the air conditioner if I circulate the inside air. This can be rid of only if I use the outside air for the a/c. But all in all, my Ford has been reliable. I use this vehicle to visit my family in another state. So even though the gas can get quite costly for these trips, this vehicle is very comfortable for long drives and I haven't had any mechanical problems as of yet-even with the extensive mileage I have put on it thus far! I also like the fact that if I got in an accident, my vehicle is big and very safe. This is very important as I use this to drive my kids around!
