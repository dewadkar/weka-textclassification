            In 1998 I bought a Ford Contour.  The dealership said they used it as a rental car.  So I thought the car should have no problems.  It was a nice looking car with power locks, power windows, cruise, and tilt steering.  I thought I had just bought the perfect car.
About a month after I got it I was driving in the rain when I lost my power steering.  Where it went I don't know.  So in the shop it went.  So they replaced some electrical wiring and said it was fixed. So I thought it was fixed. 
Until the next month when it died at a intersection and I had to push it.  So back in the shop it went.  They replaced some computer chips and said it was fixed, but you guessed it it died again about a week later and wouldn't start.  So this time I had a little computer they hooked up to my car for a week to see if it would show anything wrong.  It never did.
After about four months of my car always being in the shop and no one knowing why it died for no reason I decided to trade it off.  I will never own a Ford again.
