            I bought my Ford Ranger because it is probably the best truck on the market for the price.  Ford has brought the Ranger into a class which has little competion.  My Ranger has the 2.5 litre 4 cylinder motor, it has plenty of power for me on the road and for the little towing I do every once in a while.  I just recently took a trip from Chicago to Denver and it handled flawless, it even got some great gas mileage while driving out there.  I have to flareside edition to help with the looks and it gets a lot 0of looks from different people while I am driving down the road.  I have never had one little problem with it, the only thing that went wrong was that I had to replace my front windshield, but that was due to my fault. People who need a great reliable truck should take a look at this wonderful small truck my Ford.  The Ranger is a great vehicle to own and drive, I will own mine until I have to hold it together with duct tape.<br><br>
