            Hey all you ford fans out there! If your searching for a van or mini-van,
this is definitly for you! If you enjoy a smooth ride, incredible power (what Ford is known for!) sleek, sexy, affordable van for the family or bussiness, this is DEFINITLY for you!! I was looking for something in the 10,000-20,000 dollar range, and when I first saw the reviews, then first drove it I was sold!!!! This was definitly what I needed and what I`ve always wanted!!I love it when I stomp on the gas and I`m instantly going 75-90mph, or when I just ease into it and get the best ride of my life!!
I`ve ridden in other vans, and it just isn`t the same! And there are things about it that make it fun to ride in to not just to drive! These things include; radio control from the back, more room in any seat than most vehicles, Oh yeah , I forgot, I`m 6'5'' and I sometimes have difficulty fitting in vehicles. But never in my Windstar!!! Well if you choose to buy a ford , I commend you ! Have fun!!!<br><br>
