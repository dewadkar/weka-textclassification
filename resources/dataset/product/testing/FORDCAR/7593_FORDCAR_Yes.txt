            I bought my Ford Expedition when I was 34 weeks pregnant with twins.  I had previously driven a Ford Explorer, but wanted something bigger.  We bought one with the third row seat in it.  We wanted to be able to still go places with another couple AND both babies. <br>They are beautiful on the outside and very nice inside.  The third row seat is elevated so that you can see, but you still feel very far back.  We have not used the third seat as much as we thought we would.  I think that someone with older children might benefit more when they are taking friends along. <br><br>The features of the vehicle are very nice-good stereo system and air conditioner.  There are radio controls for the second row passenger to adjust volume and change the station using memory buttons.  There is also an air conditioner control for the vents that are above the second and third row seats mounted on the ceiling for second row passengers to control.<br><br>One of the things that I did not like about it is that it gets terrible gas mileage, which is a problem if you commute to work like I do.  Another con is that there are no cup holders in the second row except for in a fold-down console in the middle.  This is a  big problem if you have three passengers in the back because you can not use it then.  There are cup holders on each side of the third row seat.<br><br>The biggest con for us has been there is no storage in the back when the third row seat is in place.  Only enough for a few groceries.  When we go on a trip we have to fold down the third row seat and pile things on top of it.  I have not had many maintenance problems, and I have 47,000 miles on it already.  <br><br><br>
