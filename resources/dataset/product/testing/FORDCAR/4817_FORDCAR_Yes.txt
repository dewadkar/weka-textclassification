            <b>Introduction</b>
Well not too long after my old 280ZX died I bought a Saturn SL of the 2002 variety. That wiped me fairly clean in the money department. Luckily I had a friend who had an extra truck that she did not trade in. She was willing to part with her 1990 Ford Ranger for a measely little $800. I have to tell you that that was probably one of the best deals I have ever had on a vehicle even if it was 11 years old and had over 70k miles on it.

We purchased the vehicle from them and have had to only change the flasher assembly (a large can located with the fuses underneath the steering wheel), and we have a small leak on the oil can seal causing parts of the engine to turn black which will be fixed this weekend.

<b>The Vehicle</b>

This vehicle makes for a great little truck if you want to fit in with the great southern society but you don't want to loose too much maneuverability. This truck can also squeeze into some of the smaller traffic spaces.

As far as my model is concerned I have the V-6 2 Wheel Drive regular cab and bed. We have a red vehicle with silver pinstripes down the side, and decent but not awesome A/C. When we purchased this truck I was lucky enough to get a camper top made out of aluminum that fits well wtih the bed of the truck. Other than that I am not totally certain on the other specs like the headroom and footroom. I do know that I am 5'10 and weigh right around 170 lbs. and I have no problems with getting comfortable it is not too snug in any area.

I actually did try to go out and find the official specs on the internet for the Ford Ranger 1990 model but I was unsuccessful if anyone does find it and does not mind the trouble email me the address where you found it or post it in the comments here to help others out.

<b>Conclusion</b>
To finish up this tidy little epinion I have to admit that there really isn't too many of the more standard flaws you might see in an older vehicle. Like so far I have had no problems with the automatic trans, nor have I had any serious leaks other than the minor oil leak. I have to say that I would definitely recommend the model that I bought and probably any other model that has a V-6. I would never suggest going out to buy a pickup with only 4 cylinders in it.
