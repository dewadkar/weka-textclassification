            This is actually my second car. I bought my first one 2 years ago, an 88 Taurus for about 300 bucks. I put maybe 100 dollars into it and it still runs good. No ac, clock or radio but still! 

This Focus I bought 2 days ago and I'm already in love with it. It's my first actual new car and I'm happy.

The steering wheel is smaller but easier to handle! 

It's also very tight. When I test drove the car it had 5 miles on it. It now has 50 miles :) So I bought it brand spanking new. I'm not sure if it's a Focus trait, or if it's a problem with this car that I have to get used to.. Or something bad all together. I will ask around and find out. But other then that it's fine.

The stereo is great. I love it. 

As for acceleration noise I can't hear any because of my stereo. But it's not as loud as people said it would be. (When I turned my stereo down)

Small blinker handle but I'll get used to it (Don't know the actual term..) Consol in the way of seatbelt clip. Steering wheel is tight.

(Even after 2 days) I will be sending a follow up review in a few months, or when I start having problems.

Oh yes. I had about 3500 in rebates so it was a lot cheaper then 16,000! :)
