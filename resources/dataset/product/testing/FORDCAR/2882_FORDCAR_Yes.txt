            I bought my 93 Escort used from Budget Car Sales.  It had been a rental so I got a good price on it.  I have driven that car across the country and on several road trips, not to mention the daily driving.  

I put the Escort on hiatus in March 1999, so I could drive my new Mustang convertible (see opinion)and we could save the Escort for our 3 soon to be driving children.  The Escort has 95,000 miles on it and we didn't want to &quot;kill&quot; it before the kids had a chance to drive it.

The Escort has been a great car.  No mechanical problems.  It is roomy inside for a small car and the trunk can hold a lot if you're a smart packer.  The air conditioner and heater have been dependable and quick to cool or heat the car.  

I haven't had any unexpected repairs or breakdowns with this car.  I've been regularly having the oil changes every 3000 miles and have replaced the tires and brakes.  

It is so nice to have a good, reliable car.  If you find a 93 Escort for sale, have your mechanic check it out and if he says okay, grab it.  I'm sure you'll be pleased.<br><br>
