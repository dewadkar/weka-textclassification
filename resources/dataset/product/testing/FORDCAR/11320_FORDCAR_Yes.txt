            I bought this vehicle first because it is a Ford, and second because I love the way it looks.  It's not too big, but it's not too small.  I like the rounded edges of it.  It also gets better gas mileage than the larger SUVs.

The storage space is huge when you lay down the back seats.  They are easy to lay down and give you lots of room to put luggage to travel or to move furniture.  I travel frequently with my dog and have a large carrier.  It fits easily in the back and still there is plenty of room for luggage.

The back seat is not extremely comfortable for long distances.  However, you can easily transport 4 to 5 people short distances.  The back seat is not easy to access, for large adults, however, I recommend this SUV for singles anyway, not for families.

I like the height of this vehicle.  You have good road clearance and you are sitting up higher than a car, but not too high.  It handles well and there is minimal road noise.  I would definitely purchase another!! <br><br>
