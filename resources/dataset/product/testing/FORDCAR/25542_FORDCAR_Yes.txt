            I think that Vara the writer of Sport Trac: Ford's New Optical Illusion has a few misconceptions.  First of all, the writer expressed a dislike to the Explorer Sport Trac's styling and ingenuity.  i would have to say that this individual is not a &quot;pickup guy&quot;.  My first vehicle was a pickup, and I still drive a pickup.  There is nothing wrong with someone seeking the fine refinement of a luxury sedan, but if that is what you are looking for, you aren't even thinking of an SUV.  

My Devil's advocate has always been telling me to buy a sporty car, while I am holding onto my current pick-up.  You see, there are inherent problems with both...  

A car, you can fit at least four people in relatively comfortably (depending on the car).  Unfortunately you are limited in hauling anything that may get messy.  Ever try to clean mulch out of the truck of a toyota??  Trust me, it's not fun.  

A truck eliminates the problem for hauling anything, but you are severely restricted on hauling people(with a standard cab that is).  And even if you were to invest in the standard cab, have any adults out there tried to squeeze their way into the seats in back?  Anyone have an S10 or a ranger with extended cab??I bet that extra ten inches makes it a lot more comfotable for a 200lb male...

THE SPORT TRAC IS DIFFERENT!!  The Sport Trac is in my mind, the perfect combination of the two...  You can have a 4x4 SUV, haul people, and you still have a pickup bed.  We aren't hauling lumber or drywall, but how often do people these days do that anyway??  If you are like me, you probably don't even use the bed of your truck every day.  

SPORT TRAC IS ALL NEW MODEL&lt; BEWARE????  Where does this come from?  If the individual who wrote the previous article bothered to look underneath, there would have been some surprising similarities to the explorer and ranger of the past 5 years!!!  I would like to point out that this is merely a sheet metal change on a ranger!!!!!!  All of the drivetrain components are tried and true.  The only schepticism that I would put forth is do the doors open and close?  Does it look good?  Is it functional??  Of course!!!!  The Sport trac was likened to the 2000 Mustang.  To my knowledge this in't bad is it??  The mustang had problems with its intake and flashing on the manifold.  There were exhaust restrictions related to the cobra and under powered results...  The fact remains that the sheet metal was changed NOT THE DRIVE TRAIN!!  This is the same case with the explorer.  Take all with a grain of salt, if your ranger or explorer runs fine, I would expect the Sport Trac to do the same.  

I LOVE THE NEW EXPLORER SPORT TRAC!!!!  This truck is what I have been waiting for in a new vehicle.  It is everything i have ever wanted in a vehicle and i suspect i am not alone out there.  The dealerships that i have gone to can't keep them on the lot.  

MY EVALUATION
Buy it.  If you are a truck guy, a car person, or somewhere inbetween, you can't go wrong.  If not actually buying it, just test drive the darn thing.  There are so many good points and innovations, you will love it too....

NOTE TO VARA:
Try evaluating the fully loaded version.  The fully loaded Sport Trac may be more expensive, but there are so many &quot;extra&quot; niceties involved.  The Power Moon roof was a real nice touch.  The Larger (Sport Group) tires look great and hold the road well too.  4.10 Gear ratio (optional - Once again for the truck guys out there) is great for turning the large tires and giving that extra effort for towing.  Leather seating surfaces with LUMBAR support!  Great, i am a real fan of how Ford Leather looks and feels in this vehicle.  The In-Dash 6-Disc CD changer is a nice touch too.  I hear that there are plans for an &quot;ultimate&quot; sound system.  What that entails, but I will tell you this...  I can't wait to find out.  And in closing, you can't judge this one with the runt of the littler...  It's bigger brothers and sisters have a lot to say!!!<br><br>
