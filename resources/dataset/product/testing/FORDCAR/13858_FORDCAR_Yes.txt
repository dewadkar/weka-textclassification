            We purchased a 1998 Ford Contour in September 1998 so that I would have a reliable car for weekly work-related travel throughout rural South Carolina.

The Contour fit the bill.  Excellent gas mileage made it a bargain to drive (even at the state reimbursement rate).  The roomy trunk easily held all the equipment necessary to run a rural training program (laptop, projector, boxes of handouts).

The Contour handles very smoothly....more like a sports car than a family sedan.  

The Contour has since become my husband's car for commuting, and with 30,000+ miles on it, we've had only minor problems.  I recently drove the car on a couple of trips, and found it reasonably comfortable for travel (6 hour drives).  My backseat passengers were less impressed.

I would recommend this car to a small family (1 or 2 children) or a commuter looking for a reliable, reasonably attractive car to drive on a daily basis.
