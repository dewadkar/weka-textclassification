            This is the first vehicle I can say I love. I will never purchase a different type of car if I can help it. Besides being extremely reliable, I was in an accident and walked away without any injuries (the other driver couldn't say the same). I am so pleased with this SUV that I purchased one for my son when his used car kept breaking down. I LOVE my SUV and would highly recommend it to anyone. It is comfortable, has NEVER had any problems (mine is a 1997) and kept me safe in an accident.<br><br>
