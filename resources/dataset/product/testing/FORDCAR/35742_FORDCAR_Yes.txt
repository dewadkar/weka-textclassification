               Well, about 90 days befor my birthday I was wanting a car really bad! I told my dad that I wanted a truck. He never answered and then when I mentioned a mustang he said that he would take that into consideration. Well, 20 days until my birthday and I walked out of school and there was my car. A red 1997 mustang! I about died. It was power everything. The only 2 things that I wish that it would have came with is a CD player and the keyless entry thing. 
   
   Even without those it is still an awsome car. It's a 5 spd. manual. I can get it up to 60 Mph. in about 7 seconds flat. I love the speed and the handling of this car! When you put that thing to the floor it is gone right then, it doesn't think anything about it! You can also spin the tires with no problems! I tried it!

   The seats in this car are so comfortable that I could live in them. It has a driver side power seat. And I sit a little tilted back and boy does that seat feel good. It's not hard and not to soft. I love it! 

   I would recommend a mustang to anyone that is looking for or someone with a small family. They are a lot of fun and they get you where ever you want to go. <br><br>
