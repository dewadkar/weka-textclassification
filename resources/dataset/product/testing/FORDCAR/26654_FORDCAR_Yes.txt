            Upon first glance, the 1995 Ford Escort isn't a real eye popper.  But hasn't it been said that it's what is on the inside that counts?  Better words have not been spoken concerning this car.  I test drove it against a Dodge Neon of the same year.  As far as power and acceleration, there was no comparison.  The Escort was a lot more zippy.  Reliability has been unsurpassed by any previous car I've owned, including a Chevy Camaro.  The driving comfort of the car is decent as well.  My Escort has a nice cloth interior, which is very comfortable when compared to the vinyl seats of a similar car, say, a Toyota Tercel.  The gas mileage is great, around 35 to 40 MPG; and in the 18 months and 40,000 miles I've owned the car, I have not had one break down.  On the downside, the car comes with automatic seat belts.  I have had to replace the driver's side motor and track, which, conveniently, is a fairly simple procedure.  I did the labor myself, and the parts were approximately 200 dollars.  However, that's probably the same amount I've saved in insurance from having the seat belts.  Cabin noise is also a problem; it's a pretty noisy car to drive in.  Just turn up the radio, though, and that too, can be taken care of.<br><br>
