            As you have probably read in my previous posts, I used to own Toyotas but now I drive an F-150.
In 1999, I was driving a '91 Toyota 4Runner.  I really loved that vehicle.  However, it had over 100,000 miles on it and the body was starting to rust.  Also, changing oil on it was a pain.  You literally had to take off the left-front tire and reach through the front suspension to get the oil filter off.
So, I went to the local Toyota dealer.  I test drove a new Toyota Tacoma and I loved it.  It was everything I loved about the 4Runner, except it had plenty of power.  (I was surprised at how much power it had with the little 2.7" I-4 engine).
However, the Toyota dealer didnt want to deal.  They said they would only give me $8,000 for my 4Runner.  I was frustrated.  I wanted a truck and I wanted one NOW.  
My parents have always owned Fords.  So they recommend that I give a Ford Ranger a try.
I went down to the Ford dealer and test drove a Ranger.  It rode nice and had good power.  I had my doubts about Ford's build quality and dependability as compared to a Toyota.
However, I needed a truck, so I took a chance.
Mine was a '99 Ranger 4x4 XLT Supercab.  I owned the Ranger for 3 years and overall I had good luck with that truck.  It wasnt perfect, but it was pretty good.  I did have some problems with it.  It has 2 sheetmetal screws missing on the front of the box, so it had a squeak that you could hear if you had the rear window open.  Also, the tires that it came with were junk.  It came with Firestone Wilderness ATs P245/75R15's.  Dont get me wrong, they were good tires for dry pavement.  They were quiet and rode smoothly.  In the snow or rain they sucked.  Mostly because they had a solid rib on the outside of the tread.  Tires like this should NEVER have been put on a truck with a supposed "off-road" package.  I live in Wisconsin and let me tell you, it was a challenge to drive the truck in the snow.  It was 4-wheel drive and it was fine once you got going, but taking off from every stop sign it would always spin the tires and slide the back-end around.
As far as the engine goes, I was kind of disoppinted.  Mine had the 4.0L OHV engine that make 160 hp and 220 ft-lbs of torque.  The engine had good pickup off the line (mostly due to its 4.10 rear gears), but once you got above 65 mph it didnt have a whole lot more left.  Also, the engine was loud.  Im used to the overhead-cam Toyota engines, and the 3.0L V6 I had you couldnt even hear unless you revved it up about 4,000 rpm.  However, with the Ranger, anytime you hit the gas you could hear it.
For hauling, I was pleased with this truck.  I dont always have stuff in the box, but I do use it as a truck.  Usually I haul snowmobiles or ATVs and for that it does well.  Yes, you can get a snowmobile or an ATV in the box of this truck.  With the snowmobile, you do have to put it in backwards and I advise taking the windshield off of the snowmobile, but it works.  With the ATV, all you have to do is drive it over the wheelwells.  Ive also hauled a boxfull of cement blocks and firewood and it handled all of that stuff very well.
