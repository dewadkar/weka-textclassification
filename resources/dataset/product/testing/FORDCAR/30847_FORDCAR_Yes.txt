            I bought my Explorer new in 1991.  I bought it after researching the then available SUV's.  I enjoyed its styling, leg room (especially in the front), cargo space, and interior appearance and general comfort.  For a 6-cyl, it has adequate power.  About 4 years ago, my wife and I took a 9,000 mile, 2-month trip across the US and back...we did not have a single problem... it was 4 years old, also.

We have driven it in all kinds of reasonably hard terrain (i.e., we don't follow Army tanks), and snow.

My wife and I agree that it handles quite well.

My only complaints are the the air conditioning and heat lack efficiency, i.e., they take a while to do their job.<br><br>
