            She was a 1998 white V6 coupe. Ok, not the fastest or prettiest Mustang on the lot but to me this was the car of my dreams. So sick of seeing Honda Civics and Accords on the road I went down and traded in my 1997 piece of junk Toyota. 

This was the least expensive Mustang and for $17k I got a V6 with power windows, doors, mirrors, keyless entry and one of the best sound systems I have ever heard. Am/fm cassette and CD player. All standard. This was not my mother's Mustang. In fact my mother had a 1974 Mustang and absolutely hated it. That thing had nothing but seats and a steering wheel and broke down every other week.

Well things have changed. I had 1 very minor problem with this car and it was taken care of in 1 visit to the dealer. I put 50k miles on it while I had it. The ride was smooth and refined, comfortable seats, excellent climate control, plenty of power for passing and hills. 

Drove it cross country twice. Never let me down. 

This is the tragic part. I had to sell my Mustang because I moved into the city and could not bear to see it get beat up, dinged and scratched! So I bought a Chevy metro and who cares if that gets beat up!

I would definitely recommend a mustang to anyone!<br><br>
