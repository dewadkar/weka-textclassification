                 About 2 months ago, my dad took me to get a newer vechical and I ended up with this 1999 Ford Ranger. It's a extend cab, 2door, 2wheel drive, 2.5 ltr. manuel transmission with 72,000 miles. 
     I instantly liked the looks of the truck. The tires were upgraded two sizes bigger giving it a sturty look. The interior also looks great. It took me a while to learn the clutch and gas. The clutch is very small for this truck, so stalling is very easy to do. The 2.5ltr. inline engine delivers good power. Mine also came with a K&N filter charger, which will help give more airflow and power. 
     I live in Texas and quite often I have to travel threw some very rugged terrian. This truck has not gotten stopped once, which is amazing for a 2 wheel drive. Going moderate off-road with this truck is A-OK.
     The Interior is small but comfortable, everything feels just right. I espically like the way the mid compartment is a perfect resting for the arm while shifting gear to gear. Visablity is also good troughout the truck. Mine lacked a CD player. I have a portable on there, and the 4 6x8 factory speakers deliver well ranged power.
     The biggest downfall I can find on this truck is the gas. It takes $22-$27 to fill it up depending on fuel grade. On a full tank I usually get 350 miles, getting around 16mpg. I think I should be getting more miles from a 4cylinder manuel engine.
     All in all I think this truck is strong, dependable, and just fun to drive.
