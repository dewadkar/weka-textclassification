            I rented a two door Ford Focus hatchback in L.A. and drove it across the desert (twice) to Lake Mead - Nevada and back.  My passengers included my wife, my mother-in-law, and her 87 year old mother.  I SURVIVED - WE SURVIVED - and quite nicely I might add.
I own a big Acura - so my standards were high, expectations for the Focus low.  My verdict:  "THIS IS A REALLY NICE LITTLE CAR".  WHY?

1.  Amazing room - Four adults - a wife, two in-laws, no complaints!  There was legitimate room for four and not just to the store.  We drove 5 hours in each direction.  Everyone was comfortable (I'm 6'2" and Granny's a big woman).
2.  The seating was not luxurious, but firm and comfortable.
3.  The ride was AMAZINGLY QUIET.  This was a rental car with 16,000 miles - it was quieter than the Acura Integra's I've driven.  NO wind noise.  We chatted at living room voice levels.
4.  The ride was smooth (though not cushie) and the car handled well on the L.A. freeways.
5.  110 degrees outside and the air conditioning kept us comfortable all the way.  The car never seemed strained.
6.  Not a rocket - but adequate power was on hand for general purpose driving.
7.  Good - though not stunning - gas mileage.

WHAT WOULD I CHANGE?

The car I drove was stripped down (crank the windows, lock the doors, move the seat).  I like some creature comforts and this car has the basic quality to justify the upgrades (nothing worse than power windows that always sound like they're open).
1.  Power windows, locks, and mirrors (our car had manual remote mirrors but the rubber covers kept coming off - this was the only manufacturing flaw I found).
2.  Four Doors - We had room, but getting in and out of the back seat was not a gracefully executed task for my mother-in-law.
3.  CD player.  Good sound system (though this might have been due to the quiet ride) but a CD would make it right.
4.  I never really warmed up to the exterior styling of the car.  But ours was plain white.  I could see it in black, with four doors, and upgraded wheels.

THAT'S IT - That is how I would own it.  Great basic transportation without the typical sacrifices.
