            I bought my 98 red Mustang convertible in March 1999.  In less than 10 months, I've put over 20,000 miles on that car.  What fun!

I'm a married mom with 3 kids.  I've always driven an economy car until they died.  After renting Mustang convertibles a couple times in the last year, I knew I had to have one.  You only live once!  There's nothing like driving along the beach, out in the desert, on the highway, or through the neighborhoods, feeling the warm sun, fresh breezes and smelling the flowers.  It is wonderful!

I bought the car used with about 26,000 miles on it.  We shopped around town at several dealerships and all the used Mustang convertibles had the same mileage, were in the same basic condition and were either red or black.  All of them were previous rentals.  Budget car sales also had them available.  After weeks of watching the ads, we finally saw one auto dealer who was using the 98 Mustang convertible as a loss leader in his ad, priced about $3000 under the going price everywhere else.  On the way there, we double-checked at a couple other places, making sure that this was the best price.  It certainly was!

I don't know a whole lot of technical stuff about cars, I just know what I like to drive.  My car is a 6 cylinder (the cheaper model), but after driving an Escort for several years, my Mustang has plenty of power.  It is nice to be able to make it up the hills and to pass other cars with confidence.  The handling is great.  I've also got a few other features the old Escort didn't have - the cd player, power windows, power locks and the nifty unlocking buttons on the key chain.  

Any drawbacks?  The trunk is too small if we need to travel.  And bye, bye to glamorous hairstyles if the top is down - you need to wear a hat or tie your hair back.  And being so close to the road, you tend to feel the bumps a little bit more.  And honestly, I'd rather have a blue car - the red car is a cop magnet!  Not that I would ever speed....

If you love to drive and are thinking about getting a convertible, the Mustang is for you.  Reasonably priced and lots of fun!
