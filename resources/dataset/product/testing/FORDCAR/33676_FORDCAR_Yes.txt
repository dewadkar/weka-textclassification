            I have always been skeptical towards Ford vehicles after going through some lemons. In 1998 I purchased a brand new Escort LE. I was quite surprised by the price and wasn't sure what kind of quality to expect out of a $14,000 car and figured if I didn't like it that it wouldn't be hard to get rid of. 
First thing when I bought it I got a bumper to bumper warranty and am quite shocked I haven't had to use it for anything after 2 years.
I quite enjoy driving my car it picks up speed great, gets fantastic gas mileage(thank goodness with the gas prices the last few months), handles great in all weather, turns beautifully, and there virtually isn't a sound to it.
Another thing that I love about this car is the massive amount of trunk space. I mean typically when you think of an Escort you visualize about 3 inches of space in the back and in all reality that is not the case. I managed to pack in 2 good size suit cases, 2 sleeping bags, a tent, and 3 duffle bag without having to sit on the trunk to close it!

I absolutely have nothing negative to say so far about it....2 years and 70,000 miles later it's still going strong. I would recommend this car to anyone truly worth it!
