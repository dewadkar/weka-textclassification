            The new Ford trucks are more powerful, spacious, and dependable than ever.  With the new of the F-150 you have a wide variety of options to choose from.  I highly recommend the high-power Triton V8 especially if you decide to go with an extended cab. The extended cab has plenty of room for smaller people but I the seating in the back is rather cramped if you are over six feet tall.  The automatic four speed transmission delivers plenty of torque for towing your boat, camper, jet skis or whatever &quot;toy&quot; you prefer.  The cab is very spacious and controls are easy to reach and to operate.  This truck has a very smooth ride even with the optional four wheel drive package.  Ford has really proven to be a better value than the Chevrolet trucks on the market today.  <br><br>
