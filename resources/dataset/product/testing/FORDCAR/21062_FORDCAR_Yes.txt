            We bought a 99 Windstar this year.  We've been very pleased with it thus far.  In the past we've owned Dodge Caravans and Ford Aerostars.  We were extremely pleased with the smoothness of the ride that the Windstar gives.  It no longer feels like we're riding in a truck.  

In comparision with the 4 cylinder caravan we owned, the 6 cylinder Windstar far outshines the pick-up speed.  When doing any mountain driving the 6 cylinder is not a luxury, but a necessity.

Overall, we are thoroughly pleased with our Windstar, and I can honestly say that if I were to go out tomorrow to shop for another vehicle it would be a Windstar!<br><br>
