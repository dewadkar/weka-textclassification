            I leased this vehicle because I wanted to lower my monthly payments and insurance, which I did on both counts. 

When I first started seeing the Ford Focus on the road. I thought to my self what an ugly car. But, I promise the look just grows on you and once you drive it you are sold. 

Don't confuse it with a sports car even with the Z3 engine. It is quick but, not fast. It handles great, is fast enough to merge on the interstate, and generally a great little car. Some of things I dislike are the gas mileage, not near the amount posted on the sticker, at least in the city. Highway mileage is excellent, and above the sticker estimate. 

The cup holders have removable holders, so you can either have a large or small drink and not worry about spillage. The problem with this that the holder can get lost if you remove it. There is no device for keeping it near by and if you are like me, it will get under the seat and you won't notice until your drink is spilled in the floor. Also on the passenger side the dash is too close for a large drink to fit smoothly. 

This is a great car for folks looking for a great ride at a small price, college students and newly married folks are in for a treat. People that are short in stature, may have difficulty with the height of the dash board.<br><br>
