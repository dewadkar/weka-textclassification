            I bought this because I needed 4WD and wanted something popular that I could easily resell. I bought it used at 128k and have put about 60k on it. 

In the 22 months of ownership, I have spent over $6,500 in repairs and have replaced the A/C, the transmission, the 4WD gears and lots of minor stuff. The thing is my repair shop, to whom I am very loyal, explained they see the same repairs over and over on Explorers. This is the 2 A/C replacement and the 2nd transmission replacement.

I put a lot of highway miles on my cars and have had this truck in 4WD for less than 100 miles total. I change the oil and have it serviced like a  good boy and they fellow from whom I bought it was a nutcase for servicing. This truck, as popular as it has been, is not engineered to last. I will not buy another one of these. <br><br>
