            In July of 1999 I decided I was finally gonna break down and get the car I had been wanting.  I traded my sports car for an SUV.  I have no family and am not married but I still felt like I needed a car with 4 doors and that had more room.  I had also admired the SUVs as I was driving by car lots.  I settled on a nice green 1996 Explorer with leather, a 6-disc CD changer, tape, power windows, power locks, cruise, tilt, power mirrors, power seats, and keyless entry.  I really like my explorer.  So far in the few months I've had it the only problem I've had is that the back door wouldn't open when I was on a hill.  When I took it to the dealership it turned out that the little cover that covers the door lock in the back (the same kind as the other doors where it comes up if it's unlocked) had come off and there was just the wire part and when it was on a hill and the metal part would slide back and underneath the area outside the hole so it couldn't come up when you unlocked it.  Trust me I'm sure it wasn't Ford's fault and it took 2 minutes for them to find another slip cover and slide it on and now the door works perfectly.  One feature I really like is that my CD changer is in my arm rest instead of in the trunk or under the seat like a lot of vehicles have.  This means when I am driving down the road I can change the CDs out instead of having to get into the back when I'm pulled over to do it.  I really like my explorer and am very happy with my purchase.  It is a good vehicle and seems to handle good.<br><br>
