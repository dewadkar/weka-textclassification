            My experience driving has begun with a 1997 Ford Expedition XLT. I learnt how to drive in one, and while it was far from the first vehicle I drove, it was my favorite for quite a while. In the face of all the sport-cutes that other manufacturers are producing, this vehicle actually has the ability deliver a smooth ride, decent handling, and a real truck work ability. Having driven a Yukon, I can fairly say that I would take an Expedition as a daily driver over the others in it's class any day.
If weekend trips to the cottage are your thing, this truck will make you glad you passed over minivans. It can hold up to nine people ( with the rear bench) and everything they would need for a weekend. Around my house, it was more frequently used to bring home food and bedding for our horses which was never a problem. The cavernous cargo area eats up whatever you can throw at it. 
I personally used ours to move myslef into an apartment-so much for the moving company.
I have never once stayed home because of weather. Due to the Expedition, it bacame a regular routine that whenever there was a blizzard, i would be out picking up ALL of my friends to go anywhere that we wanted. Even compared to the Jeeps and other SUV's I have driven, this truck is the best winter vehicle I have ever been in. Unfortunately that meant I never missed school due to weather.
In the summer, the ride is as smooth as you could want, handling is obviously not going to be as nimble as a sports car, but it is better than 99% of the population will ever need.
Having learnt to parallel park in it, I can promise you that if you can't park the Expedition, you are the problem. This truck is dead easy to navigate.
Offroad capabilities are limited only by approach and departure angles. If you know how to drive, and aren't traversing the Rubicon you will get where ever you need to be in this truck, even if you are towing a trailer; which is something this truck does with the upmost ease.
We now have a 2000 Expedition, and the next truck will most likely be an &quot;Expo&quot; as well.
I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who's life requires its abilities. If you just need to get the kids to soccer practice, get a subaru or minivan. There's no need to buy such a capable vehicle if you're never going to use it.
P.S. This truck comes with Automatic four-wheel drive, and REAL four-wheel drive at once. Something those little crappy Blazers can't offer.<br><br>
