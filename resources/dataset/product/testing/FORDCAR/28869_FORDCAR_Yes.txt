            Prior to owning my first Explorer, a 1998 Sport, I have owned at one time or another many of Ford's non truck models. Before leasing my first Explorer Sport model I had leased two Taurus SHO 's, their top of the line sedan. What made me change from a luxurious sedan to an 2000 Explorer XLT was that I was now driving to work daily and needed something that would ride well in snow, ice and heavy rain storms. These are reasons for owning a four wheel drive vehicle even if you do not drive off road; in my opinion. If you have ever driven on some of NYC's roads, you will also note that many of them do a pretty good job of simulating off road conditions.

My 2 door Sport model performed very well for me with no mechanical problems, good power with the bigger V6 engine and felt very comfortable driving as compared with a standard automobile. I have also owned a Jeep Cherokee Limited and Bronco II in the past so I was no stranger to 4x4's but found the Explorer to be more car like in its handling and with better interior fit and finish. As with my previous ownership of a 4x4, it did not snow the first year I owned it. My friends delight when I get a new 4x4 for it seems to insure a snow free winter. The second year however did produce a heavy snow storm and I was looking forward to driving in it. As luck would have it, I had to turn back and go home. The Explorer had no problem with traction in the snow but the flimsy windshield wipers kept on icing up. This is my only complaint with the Explorer. It seems to have very flimsy wipers. I have had more heavy duty wipers on passenger sedans. This was a constant problem with my Explorer. The design of the wipers is such that any ice in the many joints will cause it to not properly make contact with the windshield and thus not clean your windshield so that you could see. I have also had this problem with rain when it is cold outside. I have heard someone else who had this same problem.

Nonetheless, I have just leased my second Explorer, an XLT with most options such as leather and moon roof. I was surprised to find that its height is actually lower than the Sport model and it also rides better, probably due to the longer length. I got the V8 AWD after realizing that the 4x4 is more like a two wheel drive most of the time, only applying more power to the front tires in increments as needed. I did slip on gravel and sand with the 4x4 due to this incremental applying of power in stages. I also understand that with the 4x4, power is from rear to front tires rather than individual tires as is with the AWD. In any event I have found the AWD to handle better than the 4X4 in inclimate weather. It also seems to lean much less in the turns.

One surprise was my Wife saying that she wants to drive it. She did not want to, nor like to, drive my Sport's model for some reason. She found it intimidating, perhaps because of it's shorter and higher look combined with her 4' 11&quot; stature.

All in all, I love the Explorer and would recommend it to anyone with the warning about the poor gas mileage. It performs well whether rain, snow or shine and I have no problem driving up to a formal event in it as SUV's have become a car of choice for the country gentleman. :)
