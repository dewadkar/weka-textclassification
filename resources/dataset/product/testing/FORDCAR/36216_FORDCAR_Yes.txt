                 My parents just bought this car.  I love this car because we like to travel a lot and practically live in a car!  Well this car is comfortable and makes a very nice ride!!! I love the seats and mostly the way it rides. It handles curves very nicely.  (I live in a town where the roads are nothing but curves so trust me!)
     Even though this car is new, It has lasted very nicely.  The buttons and all the little gadgets are in a great place and the doors are automatic. 
The one bad thing about this car for me is that it is a stick! I hate driving a stick. I am just about to get my driving test and who would like to practice on a brand new car? well anyway, this car is very nice, comfortable, and affordable. (especially if we got one Ha)
     The only people that should buy this car is the ones who don't like sticks!<br><br>
