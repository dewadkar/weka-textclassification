            Overall, the Ford Escort is a great car, but so long as its newer than a 91.  I've personally owned a 1988 Escort GT that I bought used in 94. I loved it when I got it, but after a year of driving it, everything started to go downhill.  I took meticulous care of the car including washing, fluid changes, you name it, I did it.  But unfortunately, everything involving a computer chip, died on me, usually while on the highway or in busy city traffic.  It got to the point where I could count on having at least one four hundred dollar computer chip replaced once a month.  Had it not been for the overwhelming expense, I gladly would have kept the car, but I figured at $400 a month, I should be driving something new!  So needless to say, I traded it in for a 97 Cavalier and haven't really regretted it.  One thing I can say for the car, it was alot cooler than the Cavalier, and way more fun to drive!  I really miss the 5-speed.  As for newer models, my girlfriend is currently driving a 94 Escort, and hasn't had very many problems.  Her latest problem was the shift rod needed to be replaced along with a couple bushings.  She thanks God every day that she bought the extended warranty, which she has already gotten her money back from the repairs.  None of the problems have left her stranded though, which says alot for how much better designed the 94 was compared to the 88.  Although I personally think my GT looked better than hers, it is still a sporty car with surprising acceleration from such a small engine.  Just one hint if you buy an Escort, keep an eye on the drain holes in the wheel wells for the door sills.  They plug up easily and flood the car during a big downpour.  Its happened to my Escort and to my girlfriends 94.  It took me almost a year of ripping my car apart to finally figure out where the water was coming from. (It would only fill up with water while the car was moving, then drain after sitting still for a couple hours)  Just a hint in case you have that problem.  So- my advice- go for it, I doubt you'll regret buying an Escort.<br><br>
