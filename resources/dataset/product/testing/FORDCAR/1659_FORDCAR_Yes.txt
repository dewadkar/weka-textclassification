            I just got my first brand new car/truck.  It is the Ford Excursion Limited Edition.  This thing has all the bells and whistles.  All my husbands friends say &quot;she can drive that thing?&quot;  Yes, I can drive it.  In fact other than being a little tight in my driveway this very large SUV drives just as easily as my T-Bird did.  I have all leather interior that cleans up very nicely.  The dual a/c controls are great for people in the back seat.  My oldest child loves the fact that she can listen to her own music while I'm listening to mine.  Both of my children love being able to look out and see everything around them.  

The only thing bigger than this SUV on the road is the 4x4 version.  Of course there is only a three inch difference.  My husband loves the size because he says that if I am ever in a wreck I'll win.

If you are looking for a new SUV that holds 8 people and all the stuff that goes with them this is the one for you.<br><br>
