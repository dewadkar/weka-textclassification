            My brother bought a 1992 Red Mustang Convertible and it is a pretty sweet car.  Convertibles are just fun to drive and ride in, and it being a Mustang is just ten times better.  This car doesn't have that much power, but it gets the job done.  It is by no means a small car, but after driving a V6 Truck for a while this car doesn't have the power.  The front seats are pretty roomy and I feel comfortable in them.  However, in the backseat, you better be ready for a cramp job.  There is no room in the back for real humans.  Maybe kids under 10 years old.  4 adults can sqeeze in for a couple minute drive, but not much longer.  Overall good car<br><br>
