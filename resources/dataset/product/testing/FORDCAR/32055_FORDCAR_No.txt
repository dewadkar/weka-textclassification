              The Ford Explorer is not the biggest SUV, but it is too big for me.  I cannot stand driving in it for many reasons.  First, it is a very flimsy car and a collision with anything larger would mean my death.  Also, it has horrible suspension which makes listening to cds impossible because of all the skipping and every ride is very uncomfortable.  The gas-mileage, although good compared to an expedition or excursion, is much worse than I would hope for.  It is about 13 miles per gallon city/ 18 miles per gallon highway.  With the gas prices as high as they are having a car which guzzles this amount of gas is killing my wallet.  Finally, despite the atrocious size of this behemoth and the trouble I have in finding a parking place for it, it is still impossible to fit into.  It has room for five people, if you and your friends don't have legs.<br><br>
