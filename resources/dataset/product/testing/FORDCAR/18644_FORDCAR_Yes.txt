            I bought my Festiva new in 1993,and I'm still driving it.  it's a great little car, easy on gas and good for our Alberta winters.  I've had no problems with it on ice or in the snow.  It also starts well when the temperature drops to sub-zero.

One complaint I have is with the tendency of the ignition to lock.  sometimes wrenching on the steering wheel while turning the key is enough.  At other times, it's necessary to get out and kick the tires to break the lock loose.

The Festiva is easy to handle and small enough to slip into parking spaces larger cars have to bypass.  There is no power steering, however,and if you are use to power steering, it takes a while to become accustomed to driving without it.

This is a compact car, intended for small families.  With only two doors, getting in and out of the back seat can be awkward.  I do love the roomy hatchback trunk though, with ample room for groceries or other items.<br><br>
