            The 2001 Explorer Sport Trac has been a very convenient vehicle for my family of four.  I've debated long and hard in trying to buy a large sedan or SUV, but when Ford came out with the Sport Trac, there was no question about how utilitarian this design would be.

Prior to owning one, I was dreading spending the extra money on a trailer to tow a motorcycle, surprisingly enough, the truck bed of the Explorer was just long enough to haul my 600 (with the tailgate down, of course.

The ride is pretty smooth contrary to some reviews I've read about it handling like a truck.  This is my first, so to me it really felt no different than a car.  Trucks and SUV's these days are made so much like cars that it's really hard to tell the difference (unless you're driving a BMW).

The interior is very spacious, BUT the rear seats I found were uncomfortable for taller adults.  The rear bench felt low and short so there was no support for my upper legs and the seats sit very upright with no tilt adjustment.

Other than the gas guzzling, I would have to say we are very pleased with the design, comfort, and versatility of the Sport Trac!!!

Just a few notes on convenience:

Taking trips to grandma's house for Christmas, we were nowhere near short on cargo space; room for two bikes and lots of gifts! 

Always able to bring the kids bike to grandma's when visiting and tote lots of food back home!

Avoided the hassle of buying and pulling a trailer to tow a motorcycle!

Able to transport new trampoline for kids, 8ft. table for parties, and the neighborhood kids to the park without the hassle of having to rent, borrow, have delivered, or take two cars!!!

This is the true definition of a Sport-UTILITY Vehicle!!
