            If I had my way I would never drive anything but a Ford Explorer! I have owned three of them, and each one gets better than the one before. The ride is comfortable on my extremely picky back, I am up where I can see everything, and there is tons of space for groceries, dogs, whatever. In addition, I feel totally safe and protected at all times in my Ford, no matter what the weather or road conditions.

I don't know much about what goes on under the hood, but I live on a mountain road where it gets icy, we thrill to mud season in the spring, and there are enough curves to satisfy Victoria's Secret fans. My trusty 'splorer goes through it all politely and safely. I usually have it on automatic 4WD, but if I think I need another notch of protection I can flip on the fly to high 4WD. (My last Explorer was a V-8 with all wheel drive, which I liked better, but we couldn't get it on this one and I find the V6 provides ample power on the hills.)

Little details I adore - outside temperature indicator; keypad entry (I leave my keys in the car); delayed lights so I can see my way into my house (I am used to having people at restaurants yell, &quot;Hey, your lights are on&quot;); a great CD player; air and radio controls in the back seat; ability to lock out the back seat controls and the window controls.

Nit-picking complaint - Air conditioning can't be directed the way the heat is. (Okay, so sometimes my feet get hot!!)

I disagree STRONGLY with people who say this vehicle drives like a truck. I find it soft and smooth as any full-sized car. The running boards are necessary to get me into it, but I don't mind that. Anyone with a family, or a house out of the suburbs, or a large shopping list, will love this car. It is as steady and reliable as an old and trusted friend, quick to lose the ice in the mornings in January and quicker to cool off in the hot days of August. I intend to stick with Ford Explorers, even after the Firestone tire debacle, which, by the way, my dealer is handling satisfactorily for me. I assume that one of these days all my tires will be replaced but so far there is no problem.
