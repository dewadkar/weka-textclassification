            I was in a car accident almost 2 years ago and our Explorer was totaled. Thankfully, no one in our car was seriously injured! (other than my broken ankle and toe from trying to stop!) My son was 2 and in his car seat in the rear seat. He walked away with just tears in his eyes. I had never been in an accident before and I'll tell you, we bought another Explorer! 

I was so impressed with the way the Explorer's design handled the crash, protecting all inside from anything serious. The front end rolled underneath itself, keeping the engine from being pushed into the cab. 

I know, you are looking at SUV's and the last thing you want to think about is an accident. But I'll be honest, especially if you have kids, you'd better think about it! This vehicle didn't flip, no steering wheel in my lap, no glass either. 

I have a few complaints with it though. The brake system isn't very durable. Ever since we got the new one (also a 1992) we have had squealing with the brakes. They have been replaced a few times just within the past year. Also watch the wheel bearings with the automatic hubs (4x4 model). We just replaced them as well. 

Overall I am very happy with this vehicle. We have plenty of room for traveling and it's not too bad on gas. The fold-down split back seats is a handy feature too.<br><br>
