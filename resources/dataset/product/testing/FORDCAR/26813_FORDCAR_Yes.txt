            My 1999 Black Ford Expedition continues to thrill me.  I can't even describe how useful the SUV is to me each day.  In the Expedition, Ford has created an affordable, superior automobile.  In the driver seat of my 
Expedition I tower over the other cars and I feel extremely safe.  

My brother used to have a Toyota 4-Runner and now he has a Landcruiser, but I really like my Expedition a lot better.  One of the reasons I prefer the Expedition over the 4-Runner, Landcruiser, Jeep Grand Cherokee, or LX-450 is comfort.  

Where many SUV's can seem crowded and small inside, the Expedition is very spacious.  Ford has done a really good job of utilizing the space inside this monster of a vehicle.  And that is very good for me because I am actually pretty claustrophobic myself.  Not only is there a lot of room for the driver and front passenger, but the back seats are also surprisingly comfortable.  I really never get any complaints from my passengers even when I have up to 6 fairly sized guys in the back.  

The only place that could really use a little bit more space is the trunk.  Well, that is of course if you have a third row seat.  Without that back row the trunk has enough space even for a couple bikes or maybe a monster audio system.  The Expedition is also very accomodating because it has multiple cup holders (special cup holders that are designed for almost any kind of cup, including coffee cups), dual lighter outlets in the front, and another outlet in the back.  Passengers often enjoy the rear radio controls and separate air conditioning controls.  

As far as performance, the Expedition again outdoes the rest.  With the V8 Triton engine, I many times fool myself into thinking that I can out-accelerate a Porsche when I'm lined up at a light.  I certainly can, however, leave a 4-runner or Landcruiser behind in the dust.  The Expedition is also very useful for driving down back dirt roads and bumpy areas because it has good suspension.  

The thing I hate most about my Expedition is washing it.  It's so big that by the time you finish washing one side, the other side dries.  It's also sometimes hard to park in small spaces.  Another thing I dislike about my Expedition is that the windshield wipers sometimes decide to go off on their own (not repeatedly, but it just gets annoying sometimes).  The factory audio system sounds really good considering it is a factory system.  

The number one thing I like about my car is that it looks great.  After a car wash when it's all shiny, I'm really proud to drive down the streets in it.  It towers above everyone and has nice chrome.  Everyone I know loves the looks of it, especially all the girls that I pick up in it.  It's great to be able to pick up 7 girls all at one time.  :)

I would highly recommend the 1999 Ford Expedition for it's comfort, style, and performance.  I think that it's worth every penny of it's retail value.<br><br>
