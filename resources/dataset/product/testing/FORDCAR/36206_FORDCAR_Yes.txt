            As a sales consultant at a large Ford dealership, it's hard picking out a vehicle that I would want to purchase. (well lease, actually)  When the Focus arrived in early September '99, it took only one test drive to decide to trade in my '99 Ford Ranger 4x4 that I had for 6 months.  I liked the styling (done by the same design bureau that did the new VW Beetle), the interior is designed around the driver's comfort and convenience, and I was able to fit into the vehicle. (6'3&quot;, 250 lbs)
I also liked the performance of the DOHC Zetec and I chose the automatic transmission, because I drive in heavy traffic every day.

I think people that got Foci early on were running into problems with some minor things because Ford rushed this car through production to sales due to the positive media response the Focus received.  Since about January, when the factory finally caught up with the production demand, the quality control has improved greatly.

My Focus currently has 11,500 miles and other than having to have the fuel door replaced, has had no major problems.

The Focus is, in my opinion, pound-for-pound the best car Ford makes, and would stand up in any comparison across all brands.  Currently we are getting about 6 or 7 Foci in every week from the factory, and they are sold before the weekend.  If you are thinking about buying one, get out there quick!<br><br>
