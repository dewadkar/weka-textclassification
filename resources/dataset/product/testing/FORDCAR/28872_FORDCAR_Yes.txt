            Six months ago my parents bought a 2000 Ford Explorer XLT. We needed something that was comfortable and something that had an engine big enough to tow our camping trailer. We looked at four other different cars: The Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Durango, Toyota 4Runner, and Ford F150 truck. Here's what it came down to:

Dodge Durango: None of the models felt &quot;strong&quot; enough to pull the trailer. They were roomier, but overall just didn't feel like a very good car.

Jeep Grand Cherokee: Not very roomy, very expensive for what we needed.

Toyota 4Runner: Very gutless, very expensive, very small.

Ford F150: Drove great, nice and powerful, but not enough seats, and too big for our garage.

After looking at these cars, they were a little disappointed, but after looking at the F150, they saw the Explorer. It looked nice, they could tell it would fit in our garage, it had the V8 engine and lots of extras, and the price was around what they were looking to pay.

The test drive sold them. A couple hours later they drove it home.

I have since driven it many times, and we have taken two trips to California in it. Although the interior is comfortable, I quickly noticed that it was not the roomiest, especially the backseat. I am 6'2&quot;, and I was very uncomfortable in the back. You don't get very much legroom at all. It reminded me of sitting in the back of my mom's Civic. The front seats were roomier, but still a bit cramped, although the driver's seat seemed bigger for some reason.

The ride is very smooth, but I had expected it to be a little less bumpy. Not that it's a rough ride, I was just expecting a little more. It's very quiet inside, even at higher speeds. The seats are firm and supportive, and have adjustable lumbar support. The heater/AC work great, you can get the car toasty warm or freezing cold in minutes. Also the power moonroof is really fun to have in the summer. (The dealer threw this in to &quot;sweeten&quot; the deal)

The car handles great. It has very quick acceleration with the V8 engine, and it only feels like it's rolling a little bit when you corner. Oh yeah, it stops great too. A dog ran out in front of our car (when it was raining) and we stopped almost instantly while going 35.

The sound system is pretty nice. It comes standard with a CD player and I think six speakers. It sounds crisp and clean, but distortion becomes a problem when you crank up the bass and try to turn up the volume. However, if you're like my mom and you listen to mellow soft music, that shouldn't be a problem. But for all you punkers out there..you'll probably want to upgrade the sound.

The last thing was the price. For a starting price of $33,000, I keep trying to figure out where all that money actually is coming from. The car has some extra options you wouldn't see in other cars, but $33,000? Come on, that's pretty steep when you could buy a Lexus for the same price. (Albeit, not a Lexus SUV) But, you definitely get what you pay for - a good solid car. (That's a little cramped.) :)<br><br>
