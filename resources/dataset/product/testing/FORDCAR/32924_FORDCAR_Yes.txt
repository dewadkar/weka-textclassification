                 I bought the Ranger Because I needed a small truck so I could carry a canoe and camping supplies. I was looking at Toyota, Nissan, and Chevy basic trucks because of my monthly budget payment was a major concern. I told the salesperson at each dealership that I only had about $500.00 to put down and needed to keep my payments about mid to lower $200's. I also told them that I would lease short term if that would help me reach my budget goals. All I was shown was regular cabs with standard transmissions, all nice basic trucks. Than I saw an ad for a Ranger lease $500.00 down $169.00 a month the same type of truck that I had been looking at for over 5 weeks but $50.00 to $75.00 cheaper payment. Than the salesman said for a little more I could get a lot more truck. I thought o'boy this is the old bait and switch. Please God, bait and switch me every time if it turns out like this. He showed me an automatic 4x4 extra cab step side xlt that was loaded with everything including their best sound system, I was in love. He told me with a $1000.00 down my payments would be $250.00 a month for a 36 month lease. After finding the extra $500.00 for the down payment the truck was mine.
    After 10 months and 12000 miles no problems I still love this truck. The extra cab is great for room inside but it takes away from the length of the bed so its a little harder to carry all my gear but I manage. The ride and noise levels are not luxury car standard but better than most 4x4 and as good as any I have drove. The 4x4 is great to get back in remote areas but it is not hard to get stuck if your not careful. In fact if I get another one. I will look to get the limited slip axle's both front and rear. Gas mileage is poor at 17.5 all around mileage but fair for this type of truck.<br><br>
