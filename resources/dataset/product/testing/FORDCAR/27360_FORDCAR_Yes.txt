            My husband bought our Thunderbird as a program car in March of 1993. It had 60 miles on it. It now has close to 108,000 miles on it, and is still a good car.

It never gave me a problem until after it turned 90,000 miles. That was when we had the transmission rebuilt (for $900). Apparently the person who did the job for us did it right, because we haven't had a problem since with the transmission.

Our Thunderbird has a 5.0 liter V-8 engine, and runs like a dream! We decided not to go with leather on the inside, but the cloth seats do have the leather trim which has begun to crack. After 7 years though, I would assume that's to be expected.

I especially like the roomy trunk. I couldn't believe it the first time I opened it! I've carried many large items in it, such as a toddler bed and a bale of hay (for the doghouse). I can also get a ton of groceries in it!

Since I now drive another vehicle, my husband is driving the Thunderbird to work. It does need the heater core replaced, but other than that, it's still going strong! It also gets great gas mileage!<br><br>
