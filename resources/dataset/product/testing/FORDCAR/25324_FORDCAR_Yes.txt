            We bought our Ford Thunderbird in April l999.  Obviously it was a used car.  It is a l997 and it had 28,000 miles on it.  I thought that was a lot of miles for a car (we have been use to buying &quot;little old lady cars&quot;.
You know the kind that hardly have any miles on it.  Well, we had searched around for cars that can seat three across the back seat without a hump in the seat or on the floor.  We had checked out new and used cars in our price range (under $20,000 - way under).  This car sold for $12,000.  We got a little trade in on our 1988 full sized Caprice - basically paid for the tax.  The driver must have driven on a lot of rocky roads because it had some rock dents in the front.  We do have one of those &quot;bras&quot; that we take on and off it.  

We now have 4l,000 miles on it and have hardly had any problems besides routine repairs.  This is a red car so it looks kind of sporty (pleased our teenage son).  I hope it lasts a long time because I hate buying cars.

My husband is the main driver of this car since I drive the van (transporting more people).  It does seat five people but can be kind of squishing in the back for tall people.  We have a sunroof and I think that is another plus.  I guess I kind of wish I had a convertible and that is kind of close to one.

If you have a hard time getting into small vehicles, this one could be a problem - especially if you are getting into the back seat.  This is only a two door car.

Well, hope I have helped someone with a car buying decision.<br><br>
