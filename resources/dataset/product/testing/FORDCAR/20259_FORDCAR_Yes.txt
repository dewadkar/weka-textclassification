            I've owned Ford trucks for over twenty years.  I consider Ford trucks to be reliable and durable over the long haul.  I bought the Ford Ranger King Cab XLT for two reasons. The Ranger provides comfort in driving like a car, yet allows options of a truck. 

The Ranger is very economical to drive.  The fuel ejection system provides adequate power and fuel economy.  

Preventive maintenance requirements are a minimum.  Checking and changing fluids when recommended will provide a problem free working Ranger for a long time.

The Ranger Drives well over normal road conditions. In rainy weather the Ranger skids around curves at normal speeds sometimes.   I have eliminated this problem by weighting down the back.

The electronic Display of the Ranger at times does not work correctly.  The seat belt light stays on for long periods of time.   The check your engine light comes on even when there is nothing wrong. This requires the owner to take time to have the truck checked by a qualified mechanic. This can be a costly event for those whose warranty in no longer valid.

I would recommend the Ranger for those who need a combination of comfort and space.  The Ranger should not be considered by those who require a  truck for heavy loads.
