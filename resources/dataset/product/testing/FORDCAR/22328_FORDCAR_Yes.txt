            When my wife got pregnant, we knew that we needed to replace her 5-year old Chevy Cavalier with something more baby-friendly.  We looked at minivans and smaller SUVs, along with the Ford Expedition.

The reason why we chose the Expedition was a matter of elimination of the other options.  Smaller SUVs had no more space in them than a sedan, so there was no point in getting one of those.  We looked seriously at minivans, especially the Chrysler Town and Country.  However, the nicer T&C models cost about the same as the Expedition, and did not get appreciably better gas mileage (20 mpg versus 17).  Plus, my wife liked the Expedition better, and it was going to be her car.

The one we chose was a medium-wedgewood blue 2000 Expedition XLT with the 260 HP Triton V6 engine, leather captains chairs, a middle bench seat, and a 6-disc CD changer.  My wife wanted leather because it would be easier to clean the vinyl back seats than cloth ones.

<b>Pros:</b>
1) The big engine has good pickup.  If you test drive or buy an Expedition, spend the extra money for the bigger engine.  The gas mileage difference is negligible, and the performance difference is very significant.  You never feel underpowered in this vehicle going up a hill with a car full of people.

2) It seats 8 people comfortably.  It really does!  We went on a road trip from Atlanta, GA to Charleston, SC with 6 adults and an infant in a car seat, and we were all very comfortable.  The third seat is a little cramped for someone like me with long legs, but for most people it is fine.

3) The running boards and handles make getting in and out easy.  My grandmother is 82 years old, and she was able to get in and out of the Expedition with no difficulties, thanks to the well-designed running boards and well-positioned handles.

4) It has a nice ride.  The Expedition cruises at 70+mph very comfortably, and on a smooth road it is very car-like.  The leather seats are very comfortable also.

5) It turns remarkably well.  My father always drove Chevrolet pickup trucks, and when we got the Expedition, I expected it to handle similarly.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that parking lot navigation in the Expedition is really very easy.

6) It's kid-friendly.  We have a Britax car seat, which has a built-in tether.  I was glad to find out that the second and third row seats in the Expedition have built-in tether anchors for extra safety.  If you have kids, this is a very safe vehicle in which to drive them around.

<b>Cons:</b>
1) The suspension is too bouncy.  I don't know why Ford made the Expedition so bouncy over bumps.  I suppose it was to make going off-road more feasible, but the road ride suffers as a result.  Hitting a large bump in the road will bounce the people in the second and third rows off their seats.

2) The gas mileage is not very good.  We get about 13 mpg around town, and about 17 mpg on the highway.  This is not such a big deal, since you know going in to expect it, but it still makes driving the Expedition every day expensive.  On the bright side, it has a 26 gallon gas tank, so you are not at the pump all the time.

3) If you are using the third seat, there is not much room behind it for storing things.  We can't carry our large stroller behind the third seat while it's in the "sitting" position.  Luckily, it easily folds up behind the second-row seats and leaves a large cargo area.
