            We purchased our 2002 Mustang GT (5 speed) back in June of 2002 (we also own a '99 Cobra - purchased after the 2002 GT).  Finding the color combination we were looking for, while not difficult, turned out not to be a common option (as we expected it would be)  The car is True Blue with a grey leather interior.

Initially, the car very much lived up to our expectations, but within 2 months of owning the car, it began to squeak upon starting from a dead stop.  The squeak was loud enough that it could easily be heard from inside other cars on the road (embarrassing for a new car).  The car was initially back in the shop to find this squeak 4 times before they finally located and fixed the problem (over a day each time).  About 2 months ago, the squeak reappeared.  Since then, the car has spent a total of 5 days in the shop (all at one time - one of those days a Sunday, so it wasn&#146t a work day).  The squeak issue still hasn&#146t been resolved (it&#146s better than it was, but still noticeable).  The dealer has assured us that they will get to the bottom of the problem - my concern is when (how many more days will we be without the car).  

Style wise and performance wise, we are very happy with the purchase.  We would just like to get this squeak taken care of once and for all.  

Someone interested in an American Built car that brings back some of the American Muscle Car feel and sound would be interested in a car like this.  For the style and performance, it&#146s a good value.  Even taking into account the 260 HP provided by the 4.6 liter engine, the car gets about 24 MPG on the highway - better than I would have expected.  This makes the car fairly economical for someone, while still providing power on tap when needed.  If your seating requirements are much more than 2, this might not be the car for you.  While there are 2 rear seats, they aren&#146t large enough for much more than a small child to sit in (leg room isn&#146t the best), and entry and exit from the rear seats isn&#146t all that easy.  But, given the fact that it is a 2 door sports car, you shouldn&#146t expect much more than that.

The purchase decision was made totally on the desire to have some good old American muscle car performance while still maintaining fairly decent gas mileage.  My wife had owned a number of Mustangs a long while ago, and wanted to get back into a Mustang.  

All in all (other than the annoying squeak) we are happy with the purchase and would recommend others seeking the same things we were.  I believe the squeak thing is an anomaly, as we have other friends that have late model Mustangs with no similar problems.
