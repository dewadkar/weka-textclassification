            I am now driving a 1999 Ford Explorer Limited that my husband surprised me with last Christmas.  THis is my second explorer and I just love it.  The first one was a 1995 and I had it for 3 years.  We sold it when it had 80,000 miles on it and I was very surprised how much the resale price was.  That was one reason that we sold it because I use it for business and we wanted to get as much money for it as we could before I put too many miles on it.  I just love the way these vehicles handle on the road.  I enjoy my limited because it has more accessories but still all and all it is the same as the standard explorer.  THis time we did not get the 4X4 as I never used it before.  Living in Virginia we did not have much use for it.  THis one without the 4X4 does have a smoother ride.  I must say that these vehicles do not ride like a big car but I like the way they handle and like being up higher than a car puts me.  I also wish they got alittle better gas mileage and also that the prices would be alittle lower.  But I would buy another one I am sure.  This vehicle has room for 4 adults to ride comfortably.  Now mine looks more like a house that needs to be cleaned because I work out of it so there is alot of paperwork and trash in it that I need to get out.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone that is looking for a family vehicle or needs something for work that can carry more than a truck of a car.<br><br>
