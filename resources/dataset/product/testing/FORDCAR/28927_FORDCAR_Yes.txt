            This vehicle was a hand me down from my mom, so there was really not much of a choice in the matter.  I do love driving it though, except for the whole thing with the tires going on now.  I have gotten recall notices saying they are unsafe, and have seen many articles lately about fatal accidents.  However, despite the tire problem I do like how this car drives.

I love the way I feel when I am driving this car.  It looks cool and so do I.  It drives pretty nicely and that makes me love it.  I like being off the ground because it gives me a driving advantage.  I love the cd player and the speakers that come with it.  I can jam out the whole neighborhood.  I love that I can shove lots of my friends in the front, and back seats, and even ion the cargo section.

I hate that the tires supposedly suck.  I also hate that the materials used in making this car often feel and seem flimsy.  I am not sure how to say it other than flimsy.  Cars should not feel flimsy, especially cars as expensive as this one.  I hate that this car is such an extreme gas guzzler.  I can spend about thirty-five dollars on gas in one full tank and have to refill it in a day or two.  I don't even do that much driving.

When I am driving this car I feel large compared to the other cars.  It drives very smoothly.  It brakes quite well.  The turning radius is darn good for a car of its size.  I feel pretty good when I am driving this suv.

I think you should make sure not to get the original tires if you buy this car.  This car should be bought by soccer moms.  Instead of giving your teenager this car get them a speedy fun car.  This car is great for lugging cargo and passengers, but not quite a fun teenager car.<br><br>
