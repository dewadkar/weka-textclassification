            Recently purchased a new Ford Expedition, and I love it!  Friends tease me about the old Ford quip. (fix or repair daily,) but that saying is
old hat. Let me tell you this big boy is a lean mean driving machine.  I am a short, heavy gal, and the seat adjustments are great.  The included T&gt;V and VCR kept me sane, on my last trip to the coast with the grandkids.
Didn't have to yell even once! Played movies for them,and actually had to force them out of the car at bathroom breaks!  Plenty of room too, with 3 
row of seats,( so I can separate the trouble makers!) I got the top of the line model, Legend 
conversion, leather, and a dashboard that looks like a 707! You can tow anything with this Ford, with no extra package needed, (so far)!. The 5.4 engine passes everything but the gas station, and it's not too bad on gas mileage when you figure the size and luxury you're traveling in.  Financing was great too, Bluebonnet in New Braunfels, gave me .09 and it would have been foolish to pay cash, when I can use their money and make
more leaving my own in the bank. The only thing  I'm not totally happy with is the third seat, I wish it were push button, for instance instead of removing for large shopping loads, it folded down and disappeared.
This one fold down, but sticks up too high for large loads.<br><br>
