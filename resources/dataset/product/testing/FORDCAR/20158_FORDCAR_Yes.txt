            I just want to start off by saying that anyone who has had a hard time buying a car, and gone away feeling frustrated and angry, should try starting online doing research. This is how I started. Then I went directly to the Ford website, put in the description of what I wanted. I was then contacted by a local representative. The cost of your car is $500.00 over invoice. There wasn't any running back and forth, and the endless waiting for the salesman to return with a &quot;better deal&quot;. 
I talked directly to the internet salesman told me exactly what I needed to know, and even let me know how I could save an extra $3000.00 on what I wanted. We have owned A Windstar for a couple of years, and have been very satisfiedwith it. It has a large amount of storage room in the back for those of you who have alot of children like us (we have three with one on the way). In fact, from what we have seen, It seems like the windstar is the only minivan that has a large space to store things in the back. The rest we looked at, seemed alot smaller by comparrison.
We decided to get a new one when the milage got unwards on the one we owned. And the interest rates that Ford offers every once in a while are wonderful, we secured a 2.9% rate on a 60 month loan, which is almost unheard of. 
I also learned that we didn't have to buy one with alot of extra features that we didn't need. So we ended up buying a base model with the extra driver's side door, which is an absolute must for those with infants in car seats. All this, and we ordered the exact color from the factory that we wanted, all at no extra charge.<br><br>
