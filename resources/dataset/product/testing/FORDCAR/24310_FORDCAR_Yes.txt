            My old car was a 1981 Ford Fairmont which lasted to 214,000 miles with a couple of major repairs.  I loved that wagon so when it was time to put it to rest (actually it wanted to keep on chugging but the neighbours had written John Steinbeck lives on the side so I had to upgrade) I went a hunting for new used car and found the Ford Escort Wagon.  I researched this vehicle and found that it's reliability record was good and since it was a Ford (like my other car) I felt that I could trust it to last.

Unfortunately since we purchased it used (1994 with 72,000 miles) the owner's manual had disappeared and we discovered a few flaws that having the manual would have prevented.  The main flaw is that you MUST change the fluid in your radiator once a year otherwise it turns into acid and burns a hole right through your heater core!  $270 later we found this out.  Grrrrrrrrrrr.

The only other flaw is that this car is an automatic and as I have only driven clutches for 30 years it was a difficult transition to make for me.  After putting the car into neutral once on the road while trying to shift into a lower gear for the mountain road and having the car stall on me I quickly stopped using the lower gear!   My other complaint is that we have to pay attention to the brakes more often than a clutch car as we use them more.  Oh and yes the other complain it that it's too low to the ground, makes us targets for those monster trucks and their headlights at nightime - end up feeling like a deer in a target scope.

All in all I love my new Ford and recommend it to anyone looking for a new mini wagon.<br><br>
