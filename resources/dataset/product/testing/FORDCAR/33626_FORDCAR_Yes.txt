            After driving sport utilities for years, we decided it was time for a change of pace.  We had tons of trouble with our Explorer's transmission, and the Blazer was a gas guzzler.  We decided to go for a change of pace when choosing our current family vehicle, and opted for a smaller car.
We bought our 1998 Ford Escort off of a local individually owned car lot, for around $9,000.  This was almost a year ago, and I remember the day we found her just like it was yesterday.  

Now we aren't talking about your old, almost grotesque style Escorts.  They have defiantly evolving into a quite slick body style.  There she sat, gun metal grey with a sports fin attached.  A very rounded and contoured car with 2 doors, I was attracted immediately.  (Being a woman, and not knowing a whole lot about cars, I choose based on looks, then the hubby verifies the mechanical shape of the car.)  We decided to take the Escort for a test drive.  

When I got in, I noticed it was kind of small in the backseat.  The front is okay, but the back is cramped for space.  I didn't let this discourage me however, I was already to in love with the rounded instrument panel in the middle of the dash.  Very modern looking to me compared to the simple styling of the SUV's I'd been used to driving.  Needless to say, the car drove like a dream, and after my better half looked under the hood and made a few comments on the motor being "quite clean" (and a few other things I don't know anything about), we took her home with us.

It's been a year, and we've haven't been to the garage for anything more than an oil change.  We get great gas mileage, and the ride is very smooth and stable.  The steering and handling is tight, and I feel safer with the dual airbags.  Our Escort hasn't given us one ounce of trouble, except for that less than spacious back seat.  The kids constantly kick me in the back, which is a big annoyance.

I would recommend this car to anyone, unless you are exceptionably tall, or tend to haul older kids or adults in the back seat.  While we are okay now, when the boys get bigger, we will have to upgrade to something more spacious, until then I will continue to enjoy the reliability of my 1998 Ford Escort.
