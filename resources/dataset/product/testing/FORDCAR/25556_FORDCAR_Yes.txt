            I am the owner of a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac!  Ford did good with this one!  I don't buy new cars very often, and this is the first Ford vehicle I have ever owned!  The Sport Trac handles well, has a comfortable car-like ride (some 4 X 4's I drove reminded me of being in
an off-road jeep!).  It currently has 1288 miles on it and I have not
had to take it back to the dealer for any warranty work, no squeaks, leaks pings or noises!  I can take 4 people anywhere, the back seat is comfy and roomy, and I can also haul my gardening supplies in the truck bed.  I don't really pull boats or trailers, (I'd buy an F-150 for that) but this vehicle really fits my lifestyle!  And . . . . unlike the japanese vehicles, it has plenty of cupholders!  One test drive sold me!
So . . if you like to garden, carry supplies back and forth to the office, live in a climate where it snows, need to take more than one person at a time and like to get a lot of looks . . . buy a Sport Trac!
They are cool.<br><br>
