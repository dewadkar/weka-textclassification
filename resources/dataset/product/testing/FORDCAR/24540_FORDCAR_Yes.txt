            I bought a 97 F 150 two and a half years ago after fighting my way home through a snowstorm in a Camero convertible.  I purchased the 4x4 extended cab XLT.   Now, 105,00 miles later I can sing the praises of the truck through hours of personal experience.   While I have had some maintenance (one set of tires, a new wiring harness and two oxygen sensors) I suspect no one has had less over that many miles. 

  I tow a 22 foot ski boat with no problems.  Its great to back the boat in, flip on the four wheel drive and know the pulling wheels are far from the slick part of the ramp.   Or now when it snows, I smile, reach for that little dial on the dash and slip into four wheel drive.

You don't need bad weather or conditions to enjoy this truck.  Most of my mile are on the highway.   Even in city traffic the truck is fine (and the higher vantage point has its benefits from time to time.)   

Who should buy this truck.  Only someone who wants a dependable truck that is capable of doing what you ask it to do, someone who wants a truck that spends more time on the road than in the shop, someone who can find a way to &quot;need&quot; or want to be in a situation where four wheel drive might come in handy.<br><br>
