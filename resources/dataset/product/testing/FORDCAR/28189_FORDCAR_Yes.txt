            I got my 1995 Ford Taurus GL from my parents 2 years ago when I turned 16. It had 92,000 miles on it but now has 110,000 miles. It has been an overall good car. Mine has all the options except Leather Seating, 3.8 Litre engine, and some other small "strictly luxury" type items. It has always started right up and run well in any type weather, and handles well in snow, etc... The anti-lock brakes in my '95 Taurus work better than those in my mom's '01 Accord! Needless to say, as a new driver, I have put to the test on just a few occasions. The car performs well on the highway, easily exceeding the 85 mph limit on the speedometer (maybe that's why it broke?) Unlike the experiences of other reviewers of this car, I only manage 21 miles per gallon on the highway and 18 around town. Someone said they got 40 on the highway. I had a transmission problem. What happened was the seal between the transmission and the axle coming out of it leaked and the gasket in the pan leaked transmission fluid. I changed both the seal and the gasket, and it no longer leaks; although I think the transmission was permanently damaged when it ran on little or no fluid during the time before I discovered the problem. Maybe that is why mine also does not accelerate well? Anyways, another problem, which I have heard is common in these cars, is the speedometer broke. I got a rebuilt one installed by the dealer for $200. It still works but has only been in for 2 months. The rest of the car is great considering how the person who owned it before me treated it. It is comfortable, and very roomy. I can take my friend, myself, and all our stuff for 2 weeks of summer camp (we take everything!) easily in this car. The trunk holds lots o' stuff. I also might add that it is the quietest car I have ever driven. Under fairly hard acceleration, the engine just lets out a low moan, rather than a loud buzz like you would find in a Honda or Toyota with the same size engine. I would like another "sportier" car to take to college next year, but I will have a hard time giving up this one, knowing that when driving the Taurus I don't have to worry about being stranded on the side of the road or arriving with a backache or my ears ringing.
