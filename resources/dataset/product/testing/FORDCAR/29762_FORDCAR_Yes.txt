            This Sport Utility Vehicle is a prize. The overall look of it is very powerful, especially if you are just used to driving a Honda Civic. When I first got in and drove off I almost felt like I was the pilot of a 747 jet. Going down the driveway I almost felt like I was going to take off into the sky. (Luckily that didn't happen because my review would have been slightly different)

The Ford Explorer has so many options. When I added them all up I realized I might be happier living in it than just driving in it. I find myself going to the Post Office and sitting in it for an hour just reading my mail. It really is just so comfy. 

A bad thing is that it does have so much power with the 4 wheel drive and all. I know more than half the people with them, do not know how to use that feature. It makes you feel secure knowing that you could drive through a river bed and come out the other side. But, I have to admit, that if there really was some strange emergency I would be much happier sitting in the truck waiting for someone to help. <br><br>
