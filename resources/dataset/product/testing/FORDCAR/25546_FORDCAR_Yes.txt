            As I coasted up to the stoplight in my brand-new, Torreador Red Sport Trac, the guy in the car next to me actually BACKED UP so that he could get a closer look.  I'm not sure if it's because these autos are so new, or if they really are just a head-turner.  But, I Love mine.  I've had it for about a week, so I'm still playing with all the new buttons and gadgets.

Overview and options
Combination of the Explorer and a truck.  Some hauling capabilities, but a nice, roomy, SUV-like interior.  
--V-6 engine 
--manual/automatic available
--3 separate interior &quot;packages&quot; available: convenience group (low end, no automatic seats), comfort group (driver auto seat, different look to the seats), premium (includes moon-roof and leather)
--4 wheel drive is optional
--Sport package includes larger wheels, fog-lights, front tow hooks and running board
--middle console: rear air controls and headphone outlets
--cargo cage/tonneau airtight cover
--sound system: 6 CD in-dash available
--back window which opens electronically (I love this feature, it's almost like a sunroof)

Is the Sport Trac right for me?
This vehicle is great for active folks.  We live near the Sierra mountains and frequently need 4-wheel drive.  There is a thoughtful 12-volt outlet in the bed for campers, etc.  We also have a 1-year-old and 2 large dogs.  The dogs are nicely separated from the cab, which cuts down on wet-dirty-dog-smell in your vehicle.  This comfortably fits 4 large adults and a car-seat, or five adults.  I looked at several SUVs, Min-utes and 4-door trucks, the Sport Trac won.

Advantages
Lower insurance than most SUVs (even on the little Suburu Outback).  Tiny bit better gas mileage than an SUV.  Can separate smelly things from the passengers.

Disadvantages
Although the cargo cage can extend the 4 foot bed by 2 feet, you still don't have the same hauling room you would have with a truck or even being able to put down the back seats in an SUV.  Also, although I have been told that it is in production now, there are no camper shells manufactured to fit these, yet.  Some of the colors are just awful--they look like bumper-car colors.  I dislike their blue-green selections.

Cost
The cost below reflects the following:  Comfort group, Sport package, cargo cage, single CD player, center console and TTL, DMV etc.
