            I was shopping for a '99 Cougar when I re-encountered the Contour SVT. I walked onto a Ford lot one night, and saw the SVT sitting on the showroom patio. I expected the car to cost at least $26,000 as it was a &quot;special&quot; model. However, when I saw that it was only $2000 or so more than the fully loaded Cougar that I wanted, I decided I had to drive it. I wasn't sorry. From the moment I sat behind the wheel, I fell in love with the car. I then turned the key, and was treated with the most beautiful exhaust note I've heard in a long time. The salesman then got brave, and had me take it for a drive. He wasn't afraid to let me work the car either. He had me test the power, &quot;slalom&quot; the lanes, and hit some tracks at a pretty good speed. The first and foremost thing I noticed about it's power is it's willingness to pull straight into redline. I was nearly hooked, but not ready to buy that night. However, 2 days later, I had to see the SVT again, so I stopped at another dealer. There it was. My '99 Contour SVT - Silver Frost - still in it's &quot;shrinkwrap&quot; sitting in the back lot - with just 6 miles on the clock. The dealer was insistant on a deal, and after some (lengthy) negotiations, I walked away with the car for $600 over invoice. I'm glad I did, too - the Cougar would have been too small for the family I'm soon going to have. I said to myself, &quot;This car will suit my &quot;fun&quot; needs now, and my family needs later.&quot;

I've loved driving the car from the day I got it. Acceleration is awesome for a car in it's class, and handling for a sports sedan is sweet. It feels like a point and shoot car for me. I tell it to go somewhere, and it willing cooperates within it's high limits. One thing I did notice, however, is that the gearing is a tad low, which while helps immensely with the acceleration, it must surely have an impact on fuel economy. My lead foot makes it hard to achieve much higher than 17mpg in the city (it's rated 20/28). The highest I've obtained is 26 on a long highway trip during it's break-in period with speeds ranging between 70-90mph. I know my poor economy is mostly because the car is quick, and the sound it makes on acceleration is addicting. After nearly 13,000 miles, I still find it somewhat worth the fuel penalty, though it's thirst for Premium Unleaded really hurts the wallet here in Southern California.

Vroom vroom, as my fiancï¿½ calls it, hasn't been without it's share of problems though. I have had it in for a few minor build issues. Mostly just a squeak here, a misalignment there (rear bumper &quot;sag&quot; is a common problem with the SVT models), and a defective power-trunk release. I need to take it in again, as it's now developed a quirk in the power brakes (little assist immediately after hard acceleration, say passing a car), and a hole in the left muffler. I also notice some surging as the secondary intake opens up on acceleration. They say it's normal, but at times it seem excessive, especially at part throttle. I think if Ford were to spend a bit more time on Quality Control, some of these problems could be avoided. I also have a hard time not scraping up the front facia when parking at parking curbs. I probably won't be lowering this car for that reason alone.

All in all, though, I love the car. It fits my future wife and our daughter just fine with room to spare. The trunk is more than adequate for my needs, even with the aftermarket stereo amplifiers and single sealed subwoofer box. The looks are superb, though the rear end looks a tad funky. It's definately a head turner when clean - and friends have mistaken it several times for a BMW 3 series. The occasional Honda racer has also mistaken it for the average slow family sedan, but those are other stories for another time.

Who should buy this car? Someone who needs the room of a sedan, but can't live without the performance of a sports car. Also, if you don't want to see yourself coming and going, this is the car for you. I see a few here in So Cal, but they're not nearly as common as most cars. Now, who shouldn't? Those who can't drive stick (sorry folks, no automatic here), or can't justify the extra money for the extra power in a sedan. If you hurry, you may be able to get yourself into a 2000 SVT - that will be the last year, and they are limited production models.<br><br>
