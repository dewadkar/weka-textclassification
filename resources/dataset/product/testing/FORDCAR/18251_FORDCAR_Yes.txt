            When my girlfriend (now fiance) began staying at my place, and later moved in, we ran into problems with my condo association. They don't allow the parking of pickup trucks at any time by residents, and guests can only park them during the day. She has a '99 GMC Sonoma, a nice truck, but we got tired of parking it up the street at the convenience store. Her mom had a paid for '91 Escort sitting on the side of the house and signed it over to her.

After watching my parents and some of my friends own Fords, I thought they spend too much time in the shop, and thought I'd never buy one. But this car was free and she can park it at my condo. Then she let me drive it.

For a '91 with 94000 miles on it, this car is in great shape. The paint is peeling, and we had to clean the inside up, but it's in great mechanical condition. The passenger seat is roomy and comfortable. You can sit in the driver's seat OK, but I couldn't imagine it on a long trip.

For starters, I think this car has a 1.5 liter engine. I have a Mazda MX3 with a 1.6 liter high compression engine, and the Escort accelerates just about as well as my car. It's amazing what they can do with a four cylinder. It really does feel like a subcompact from the eighties, with the small climate controls that are low mounted and the low radio, but it's easy enough. You don't have to take your eyes off the road long to adjust anything.

Handling is good, as acceleration is normally smooth, except around forty miles an hour. The automatic hits a spot around forty when it wants to upshift, but the new gear doesn't have enough power to accelerate any further, so it must downshift. Any speed between forty and fifty requires the transmission to shift almost constantly as you adjust your speed. I call it &quot;Stupid Gear&quot;. The car will accelerate well, and hold speed, but as soon as you lift off the gas it slows down, except when a cop is around. I swear this car has a sense of humor. Maintaining speed requires constant adjustment of your foot on the gas and looking at the speedometer.

The car itself will handle and corner well, but the passenger compartment won't. This car is a subcompact with a hatchback, and if you have a passenger who gets nervous, you should really slow down and take it easy on turns. The car will roll to one side in a tight turn. It won't flip over, but the passengers can be pushed to the side. The steering is confident and the brakes are good, so I have no doubt about this car's abilities in an emergency. When I drive, I have to remember that though it can keep up with my four cylinder sports car, it won't corner like it. Also, as a subcompact, the seat is sort of straight up and the steering wheel is high. I get the feeling that I'm driving a go-cart.

In conclusion, I think this is a good reliable car for local driving. I think the car would handle long trips, but I wouldn't want to try it. It gets good mileage and with the hatchback and fold down rear seat, you can put a lot of stuff in it. If you're looking for something small and inexpensive to drive around town in, the 91 Ford Escort has earned my stamp of approval (for what it's worth).<br><br>
