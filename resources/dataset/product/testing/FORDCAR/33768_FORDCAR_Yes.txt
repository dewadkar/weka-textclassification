            I am on my third Ford Bronco and unfortunately my last.  1996 was the last year of production as Ford moved its focus to the Explorer and larger 4-door Expedition.  Here are the main reasons I like the Bronco.

1) Lots of room.  I am very tall, and this car has great leg room.
2) Dependable.  As the Bronco was built on the F-150 chasis, you have a tested vehicle in terms of frame and engine.  The F-150 being the best selling vehicle in America.
3) Short-wheel base.  Because this car is a 2-door, it is actually quite short (front to back).  This makes it easy to park vis-a-vis an Expedition or Suburban.
4) Powerful.  This car typically has a big V-8 engine that offers plenty of pulling power.  In addition, on the fly 4x4 is quite nice in the mountains.

Weaknesses:

1) Brakes.  This car can chew through brakes.
2) Ambient noise.  It is quite loud inside the car at 65MPH.
3) Sliding.  This car will slide easy on ice.  I think it has to do with the top heavy nature and the short wheel base.<br><br>
