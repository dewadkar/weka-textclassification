            I just got my new Ford Focus SE station wagon in metallic green.  So far, I like it better than any car I've ever owned.  First of all, I love a bargain, and this was $17K fully loaded (Zetec engine, CD, power this and that,etc).  I got 5.9% financing for 48 mo.s which made buying about $80/mo above the base price leases (w/12K for 36 mo) The only comparable car would be the SW2 from Saturn, which is about the same cost, but an aging design, and much more cramped interior.  Second, I love the design. It is just an elegant, sporty, unusual, and eye-catching exterior.  The interior space is unexpectedly large.  I am 6 feet 220 lbs, and it is perfectly comfortable for me, my wife, my two kids, and a bunch of stuff (including a wheelchair) in the wayback.

We have a minivan as our other car, and the Focus is principally my commuting car (20 miles each way in NY City).  The engine is perfectly adequate, though if you are really demanding in the accelleration department you will be disappointed.  It is a four cylinder, and feels like a four cylinder even with the Zetec option (which is a dohc 16 valve engine).  But you can get up to highway speed (and beyond)perfectly adequately, and once you are at 60, there is no strain getting to 75.  I haven't pushed it beyond that yet.  FWIW, it has a sealed transmission that is supposed to be maintenance free for 100K (after that, I'm not sure *what* you are supposed to do with it...dispose of it like a laserjet cartridge???)

I'm a little concerned about the mileage.  Through the first tank, I got about 22 mpg on city highway driving, mostly with the a/c on.  I am hoping for better than that, so we will see.

The car won both the European (1999) and American (2000) car of the year award...the only car to have done so.  For Europeans, this is a family car.  Americans, most of whom seem to demand boats, have this pegged as a kids or starter car.  I am no kid (43 y/o) and I find the design refreshing, the economy of the car reassuring, and the fit and finish better than any car I have ever owned.

Get one.  Get another for the kids.
