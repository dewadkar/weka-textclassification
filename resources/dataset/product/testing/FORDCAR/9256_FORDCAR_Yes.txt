            I love my '95 ford contour. It drives better than most of the any cars I had in the past. It drives very well for only being a compact car. 5 years ago I was sketchy about buying this car. It cost a little over $15,000 new at the time, but I believe that it was definately worth it. This is my third car I've had since I was 16. Easily my best buy no doubt. I have a son who will be 16 in a few years and I hope to hand this car down to him when he does. And I will end up buying the lastest version of a ford contour. I recommmend this car to anyone who loves compact cars. It's definately my favorite.<br><br>
