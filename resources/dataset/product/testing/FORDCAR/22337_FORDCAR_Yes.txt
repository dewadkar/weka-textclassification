            I have a 2000 Expedition XLT, with 5-changer CD and a 3rd seat and I had a '98 model before that.  I really love this vehicle it has so much room.  I can get most my groceries behind the 3rd seat and still have room for at least 6 people! 

The leather interior is so soft and it doesn't get too hot or cold.  As a woman driving,it the handling is really smooth.  I tried the Yukon and it feel like I am driving a tank.  The Expedition has wonderful pickup and when I am turning it moves very fluidly.

I also like the way I am up higher so that I am not intimidated by all the other vehicle, I am even less worried around 19-wheelers.

The 2000 model took out the inside armrests and made the console wider, so it could be used as an armrest.  Since this made the console bigger I had more storage room.  

The console lid has a place for CD's but they fall out easily, they should put a Velcro tab on this CD holder.

The color I picked was a Deep Wedgewood, it mostly looks like midnight blue. However, is certain lighting conditions it looks Deep Lilac and I don't like that and if I had known it would do that I wouldn't have gotten that color.

I had too work hard for it but, I got a good deal at Gene Evans Ford in Union City, GA.  At the same time we got an Escort-ZX2 for our daughter.  We are just really happy with the Ford name.<br><br>
