            Ford Windstar's are the nicest mini vans you can buy!I own a ford windstar and I love my VAN. They  have a lot of room in them and very comfortable to ride in. Because Windstar's are not on  truck wheels bases they drive more smooth like cars. The interior of the ford  windstar is very nice and comfortable,it is very spacious and when you have a  few people in there you don't feel cramped.I take my van on many trips and when I go with friends places I am always the one who drives because they all like riding in my van.I think if you are looking for a mini van you should check out  the ford windstar I don't think you will be disappointed.<br><br>
