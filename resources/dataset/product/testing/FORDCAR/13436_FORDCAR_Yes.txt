            I bought my Vic in Feb 2000.  It had 65k miles.  It is silver, has the LX package with dual power leather seats, multi spoke alum. rims, all power acc, cruise.  Standard Vics have 215/70R 15 tires.  They are very skinny and tall.  I replaced them with Michelin XGT H4 235/60R 15's.  These tires are shorter and wider.  They gave the car better handling in the corners and in the wet.  They are highly recommended.  

I have owned the car for three years now and it has 115k miles.  I've only need one brake job,  I flushed the transmision fluid with semi synthetic ATF, changed the spark plugs and wires, fuel filters three times, differential fluid exchange,  two air filters and oil change every 3000 miles.  

The car is very reliable If you maintain it.  The only problems in the seven year history ( I bought it from a relative and they had no problems) is that the starter solenoid failed (replaced at local shop for $150 w/ labor) ,intake manifold leaked coolant (my father and I replaced it ourselves price was between $150 - 200 for part) and the driver's side front window motor and door lock broke (common on ALL Fords and we fixed it ourselves)  The engine though consumes a quart of oil once a month and it knocks under hard acceleration unless I use mid grade gas.  Plus I average only 15 mpg in town and 20-21 on long out of time trips with the cruise set on 75.  Plus there is a small leak in the fire wall so when it rains very hard, it leaks in the floor board and I have to pull the carpet up for a day or two to let it air out.  

Though this may sound like a lot of negatives, this is a seven year old car with 115k miles on it and it is a Ford.  So these are not really very many problems.  Ford designed the car for hard use.  Every taxi and cop car you see are all Vics.  They are made to be driven every day, last long, and easy to maintain.  

The car has a very good quiet ride, good acceleration for such a large car and is very inconspiquous.  Mine is Silver with dark tint and even  cops think I'm an undercover cop.  No one really steals these cars or break into them.  Most thieves would rather break into an import.

Although most consider a Vic a "granny car" I'm a college student and all my friend love my car.  It has a huge back seat, a huge trunk that can hold a full size spare, three amps, a subwoofer box, full size shop jack, tools, ice chest, large duffle bags, and still have more room to spare!! , and cops looking for drunks when the bars close dont even look at me.  The car is invisable if you want that as a feature.

The car is excellent for taking trips, carrying around your friends or family, and it can even pull a two ton boat or trailer if equipped with trailer towing package.  The car comes standard with an aux trans cooler, so you can add an engine oil cooler and trailer hitch yourself if the car did not come with the towing package.  

The headlight lenses turn yellow from UV sun exposure.  All crown vics do this.  The cheapest place is on the internet to replace them.  They cost only $150 a pair and they come preloaded with Sylvania lights.  The dealer will ask around $250 plus $65/hr labor.  Installation requires simple tools.  i did them my self.  You must self align them though which takes a socket wrench. 

If you can find a Crown Vic in good condition that has not been beat down, buy it if you want a reliable, easy to work on, comfortable safe car.
