            i bought this vehicle because it looked cool, was inexpensive, and the aftermarket for parts has embraced it.  the things i love about the vehicle are:
1: extremely smooth shifting.  i cant understand why anyone would buy the automatic.
2: roomy interior.  when me and my friends go driving, we fit 5 of us in it decently comfortable.  
3: anti-lock brakes.  they helped me out a lot this winter.  
4: fairly peppy engine.  lots of potential.
5: handles much better than you would think a tall compact car would
 now onto the things i dont like:
1: no sunroof
2: no tilt steering wheel in hatchback
3: no power windows in hatchback

other wise this car is the best i've had.  and trust me, i loved me crx.  yeah, i've had a few arguements with the service people at the dealership, but their a bunch of goons.  i cant take that out on the car itself. great car, if your into 4-cylinder compacts, this is the car to buy.<br><br>
