            After test driving a Toyota Rav4, Honda CRV-EX, Ford Explorer, Toyota 4Runner, Subaru Forester and Ford Escape; I bought the Escape.

I wanted something small but still able to get off road and the Explorer and 4Runner were good vehicles, but just not for me.

The Toyota had very good creature features and a quiet ride, but the rear leg room was non-existant and it had a weak motor going up hill (3200rpm up a 7% grade at 55mph). Also, seemed overpriced.  

The Honda had very good creature features (even a table for lunch), good rear leg room.  However, the rear tailgate was very difficult to open when the vehicle was facing downhill.  The tree stick shift seemed to be in an strange position.  And again the engine was weak going up hill (3400rpm up a 7% grade at 55mph).  This was my second choice.

The Escape V6 is a solid performer. I live at 6500 feet and that power comes in handy.  It took the 7% grade at 55mph pulling 2400rpm.  I liked the fact that you could control the 4x4 with the override switch on the dash board.  The read tailgate has a window lift or gate lift.  The rear leg room is good (not as good as the Honda).  The CD/Tape stereo has a better sound then the Honda and I have a lot of tapes.  I recently took a trip with 4 men with 70lb backpacks each in the Escape and we were actually passing people on the highway  going uphill.  We made it up to the top of the Pacific Crest trail near the Elephants Back in low 4 wheel drive without a hitch.  

My gas mileage has been very good, about 24mpg in average driving conditions; freeway mileage is even better.

My only regret is the fact that I got the XLS not the XLT.  I think Ford should put the automatic transmission on the floor instead of the column and Ford should offer a V6 manual transmission option.

Be careful when going to Ford dealers,  the dealer I did business with was not reputable.
