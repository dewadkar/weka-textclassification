            I have owned a ford explorer sport for about two years; I love the ride and the extras but the engine leaves something to be desired...I had this vehicle for about three months and the engine siezed up and had to be completely replaced what a disaster!!!

A friend of mine had the same excate SUV and the SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM.  Ford sent him a letter and told him they were aware of the problems but as if yet there as never been a recall or an offer to exchange the engine before it leaves you stranded on some lonely road!

I still have this SUV but refuse to drive it on trips because of the questionable reliability.<br><br>
