            Ford's '97 Mustang is a beauty of a car to look at.  It drives pretty well and gives a commanding view of the road just based on the seats &amp; windshield.  The car's perky too, with a 150-hp engine in the base model.  The GT &amp; Cobra have a larger, more powerful engine of course, but the base is good enough for driving around town, or merging on a crowded interstate without any problems.  I've got a spoiler on mine, and while I was originally concerned about it cutting off a significant field of vision out the rear, I either got used to it or it simply wasn't a problem after all.

I've got the Mach 10 sound system (w/ 10 speakers throughout the car) and the standard CD player, which does a great job playing heavy metal.  Good thing too, since the road noise is so bad you need something to keep your mind off the loud roar.  In all fairness, half of this is the extremely worn roads in the Seattle area, but even on perfectly smooth, new asphalt the noise is noticably loud.  I think my hearing's gotten worse since I've had this car.  There's also a slight rattle to the seats when going around 60 - when no one's sitting in the passenger seat, it will wobble back and forth visibly.

This car is great on an even road in perfect conditions, but snow &amp; ice covered roads are definitely not this car's friends.  It's got rear wheel drive, but all the weight is in the front.  Getting traction is very difficult even in 5 inches of snow.  Tire chains helped a lot, but I still got stuck with one chain on (the other one fell off).  Definitely not a car to take to a ski resort.

The Mustang's a pretty popular car among thieves, and the target audience is around an age where they'll likely crash their car a lot.  I'm 23 right now with no speeding tickets, but my insurance rates were pure extortion with some companies, namely State Farm and Horace Mann.  Horace Mann gave me a somewhat reasonable rate of $1050 for 6 months, until they realized I wasn't married, when they charged me about <b>$2200 for 6 months</b> of insurance.  I switched over to Progressive, and now I'm only paying $1900 a year.  Yes, it's far from perfect, but it's much better than getting reamed up the butt for $4400 per year.  Also keep in mind I only have a V6 - the GT and Cobra have a V8 and probably would cost $600 more per year at least.

Additionally, the gas mileage in this car is ok, as long as all your tires are well-inflated.  If one is significantly less inflated than the others, you'll probably go through gas up to three times as fast as normal.  This may be true of all cars, but I've had a few other Mustang drivers ask me if my car guzzles gas like theirs.

The best thing the Mustang has going for it is style.  It's fun to drive, and the sound system is great.  There's a number of women who've confessed their love of Mustangs to me.  But this isn't your car if you live in a very snowy area or can't afford extortion rates from your insurance company.
