            The �Mommy Mobile� is what I call my 1998 Ford Windstar LX van.  My husband and I have three young children and with a family of five a van is a necessity.

To be completely honest, my husband and I had our hearts set on the Ford Explorer.  We test drove a 2000 model and we loved it.  How could you not like the Explorer?  They are sporty looking and a smooth riding vehicle, however the space is a big issue for our family and there was not much difference between the Ford Explorer and our Lumina.  Our three boys were still going to be packed in the back seat.  So we decided to look at the vans.  We already knew that the 2000 models (vans or explorers) were out of our budget and we would have to settle for a used model. 

This is when we looked at the dark hunter green, 1998 Ford Windstar LX that we now presently own.  It did not take long to know this was the appropriate vehicle for our family.  Ford certainly had the safety of children in mind when they manufactured this van.  The most satisfying feature the van came equipped with was the Child Safety Locks.  The Lumina did not have this and we all know little hands will explore push buttons, pull handles and check things out.  This added characteristic makes for more at ease parents since the curious children will not put them in harm while riding down the highway.  The sliding door cannot be opened from the inside while the child safety lock is on.  The only way it can be opened is by opening it from the outside.  The only way to change the setting from child safety lock to standard lock is by moving the switch located on the inside of the door jam, therefore children cannot reach the lock to change it.

Ford also kept children in mind when they put the adjustable seat belts part of the Windstar�s extras.  This allows for you to adjust the seat belt so that it fits car seats more comfortably and safely.  The adjustment ability also allows for an older passenger to fit their seat belt more to their comfort as well.  

There are air bags located on both the driver and passenger side of the vehicle for added safety during a collision.  This is one bonus that most new cars are getting the treatment for even more safety while traveling.

The 1998 Ford Windstar LX that we own is fully loaded with many extras.  Listed below are some of the accessories our van is equipped with.
 
- Ability to unlock/lock the doors with a key pad.  To unlock/lock the driver door you push the specific button once and to unlock/lock all doors you push the button twice.  Our keypad also has a panic button, which could be a great safety asset for the single female gone shopping or anywhere else approaching her vehicle to find someone who doesn�t belong.  One touch of the panic button and an alarm sounds as well as the lights flash on and off.  The alarm is disabled by a second push of the same button.
- Four captain chairs.  The driver�s chair is equipped with an air cushion that you can decrease or increase at the touch of a button.  The driver seat is automatic and the passenger and two middle seats are manual.
- Automatic rear window button.  Just one touch of a button and the side windows on each side open.  
- Automatic head lights.  The headlights may be programmed to come on at dusk.  The owner can decide how early they want the headlights to come on according to how dark it is becoming outside.  This aids in preventing the driver from getting out of the car and leaving the headlights on.  It is also very nice that they immediately come on when you start the vehicle in the dark.  This feature can be turned off and does not have to be used but it would be a waste not to take advantage of.
- Cup holders are located all through the van for the driver and passengers.  
- Storage compartment for compact discs or cassettes to keep the van from becoming cluttered.
- There is a huge compartment in the middle of the driver and passenger seats to put a ten-disc player allowing for it to be hidden but easily accessible.
- Heating and Air Conditioning controls that specifically for the back portion of the van.  Wonderfully thought out extra for the Windstar.  There is a main control up front that can over ride the back control or allow for the passengers in back to decide how much or how little air they want to receive.  The over ride control up front is ideal for parents with young children.  This allows for cooling or heating comfort for all riders.
- Separate radio set up for headphones for the back riders allowing for extended pleasure for the passengers sitting in the middle.   
- Back wind shield wipers.  The back wipers automatically swipe across the back shield once if the front wipers are on and you shift into reverse.  (great for those rainy days)
- Windshield wiper programming.  You can program your wipers (front) to swipe more frequently when you come into a heavier rain.  This would be perfect for those that travel often.
- Mirror in the middle up top so the driver can keep an eye on the occupants in the rear of the van without having to turn completely around.  Another great addition for parents.
- Compartments specifically for eye glasses/shades, coins, and a garage door opener.  The added compartments help to keep things tidy.
- If a door is left opened and the lights are on after a given amount of time, the battery is automatically disconnected to prevent a dead battery.  

These are just a few notable traits of my 1998 Ford Winstar LX.  We also have leather seats that are easily cleaned but as well all know pretty hot to the touch in the summer until the air conditioning cools the inside.  

This is the perfect vehicle for the couple looking to travel or the large family just looking for more comfort during their outings.  The van is spacious enough for a family going on vacation with still leaving lounging room.  The Windstar comes with a bench or bucket seat choice in the middle.  We have the bucket seats, which personally I adore.  The bucket seats allow for each of my children to have their own seat.  This cuts down on the arguments while traveling, regardless if it is a short trip to the store or a long road trip.  

Most current buyers are particularly interested in the double sliding doors with the automatic opening with a touch of a button.  My husband and I cannot speak from experience of owning the double sliding door van personally but it appears there would be more to worry over the safety of the children.  We have currently heard of several people including children whom have had the automatic door closed on them.  There is at least one model that has a button within reach of a back passenger and if your back passenger is a child, this could be hazardous.  

My husband and I have found nothing but advantages from switching from our 1992 Lumina to our 1998 Ford Windstar LX.  This is one major buying decision that we doubt we will ever have reason to regret.  

<b>If you and your family are in the market for a van, I strongly encourage you to take a look at and test drive a Ford Windstar before making your decision on which make and model to buy.  Ford has put a smile on my family with the purchase of our Mommy Mobile.</b>
