               When my wife (aka Minister of Finance), and I decided we needed a new truck, the 99 Ford F-150 was first on my list due to the styling.  Unfortunately I cannot spend $23K on anything just because it is great looking (except for my wife).  I was raised in a God Fearing, Chevy Loving family, and would probably be booted out for buying a Ford product.  The F-150 was almost worth it. We looked at all of the current full size truck options to include Dodge, Chevy, Toyota, and GMC. 
   First, the good.  As I stated before, the Ford is simply great looking.  We were impressed by the smoothness of the Triton V-8.  There seemed to be an over abundance of power.  The seats were very good, but unless you opt for the top of the line XLT, I don't think the power seats are standard.  The Ford dealer must have been desperate or something, because the price we could have had the ford for seemed Lilliputian when compared to a GMC or the Toyota Tundra.  
   Now the not so good.  I don't really have anything bad to say about the Ford, just not as good as another.  The truck left us feeling it was higher and more top heavy than it actually was.  My wife swore it was going to tip over.  There was considerable road noise, but I believe it was due to the cheap &quot;no-name&quot; tires that was on it.  We both felt our view to the rear/sides was obstructed by the pillar behind the doors.  Lane changes required more vigilance to the rear than I normally allow for.  Lastly, the rear seat was reminiscent of wooden backed church pews.  Not as bad as the Toyota or Dodge, but not as good as the Chevy.
   If Chevy had not produced the 99 Silverado, my father and I may not have been speaking for a long time.<br><br>
