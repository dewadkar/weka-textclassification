            I have owned a 91 Ford Taurus since 1995.  In that time, I have sunk nearly $5000 worth of repairs into it, including a transmission replacement, numerous brake jobs, and uncounted miscellaneous electrical and alignment-based repairs.
  In its favor, it still runs after 146,000 miles.  The air conditioning still works.  However, nearly everything else does not.  I bought the vehicle expecting reliability, good performance, and decent looks for the price.  The looks are mostly intact, although the paint is scaling and flaking in spots, particularly on the top of the vehicle.  I never got the reliability and performance has been decidedly spotty.
  The Taurus provides good acceleration (when the transmission is working) and reasonably good steering, although it doesn't corner very tightly.  It does have a reasonably roomy interior, although we've experienced major fading and cracking of the hard components such as the dash.
  The major problem with the vehicle?  Anything that can fall part, frequently and expensively does.  Currently, the gas gauge doesn't work, and whenever the weather is cold, the speedometer doesn't either.  Consumer Reports lists the 91 Ford Taurus as a car to avoid, and I must agree.
  Buy the vehicle only if you can do your own repairs and don't mind lots of grease-monkey time; if you don't know your way around a Chilton manual, forget this car!  <br><br>
