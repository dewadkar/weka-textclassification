            My truck is a 95 single cab. I bought it for a few reasons:

1. It was cheap
2. good on gas
3. I like ford trucks

If these sound appealing to you then it might be the truck you need. 

Mine is a 2.3 litre straight four. Now this doesn't have piles of horsepower,,, but it will get you where you want to go for a very small investment in gas. My ranger is has a standard transmission which I like because it keeps you awake during long trips.

The box isn't very big on this truck. The most that I have carried is a long track snowmobile weighing about 500 or 600 lbs,, but that is kind of pushing it a little. 

If you get the chance to drive one of these you may be surprised, the ride quality is very smooth. The handling is tight and accurate. 

The space inside the cab is very limited. If you are a real big person this just might not work for you. The standard cab can fit three people or 2 with the arm rest down.

I highly reccomend that you go check out this truck,, take it for a ride,, you won't be dissapointed,, I sure wasn't.
