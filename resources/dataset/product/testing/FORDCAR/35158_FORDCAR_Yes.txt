            The title of this epinion sums up this car. The car is not flashy, it is not stylish, it does not look great but is is reliable and that I think is really the most important feature of an automobile. I do not want to be driving down the street and have my car break down. this is my second Ford Escort and for the seven plus years that I have driven this type of car I can honestly say that they have been extremely reliable. I also must say that the handling on the car is good too. The car does not have any problems on turns at all .Mileage on the car could be better but  guess that in part has to do with the rising price of gas. If you are looking for a sturdy car, get this one you will not be disappointed in it.<br><br>
