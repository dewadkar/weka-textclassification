            The reason for buying it is that in my opinion the Powerstroke 7.3L Diesel is the best Diesel on the Market, and Ford is setting the standard.  The Gas mileage for such a big truck is excellent 19 MPG HWY,  17-18 City MPG, and my truck is a 96 Ford F350 Crew Cab, 4X4.  Driving this vehicle is a real man's truck, BIG &amp; BAD.  If you like Big this is the Truck for You.  <br><br>
