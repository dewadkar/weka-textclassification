            My mother bought a 1995 Taurus two years ago and never had a day of trouble out of it, so when I had enough money to buy a car of my own, I was hell bent on finding another one.  Lucky me, I found one almost IDENTICAL [mine doesn't have keyless entry] for a very reasonable price.  It's needed a slight bit of preventive maintenance  [replacing a belt and a couple of hoses] but nothing that any other six or seven year old vehicle with 92,000 miles on it wouldn't have.  

It's a nice ride... the seats are comfortable and easily adjustable to accomodate my rather small frame [in other words, I can actually reach the pedals without straining, and see over the wheel].  Not that I even have to touch the accelerator much... just the slightest bit of pressure and it does exactly what I want.  The power steering works great... some cars I've driven have seemed almost arthritic, but this one moves as smooth as silk.  It also takes tight turns a lot better than comparable vehicles [never try to make a sharp right in a Camry, you'll take out somebody's mailbox or front bumper].  So far, my car gets about 16-17mpg in town and my mother's gets about 20, so it's not too shabby in the gas mileage department either.  

My only issues with this car concern the appearance.  It looks like what it is... a very practical, well-made mid-size car.  That may be all well and good for, well, my mother, but if you're childless and under the age of 30, I advise red, black, dark green or navy blue... my beige one has been called a "soccer mom" car.  Not that I mind TOO much... this is the best buy I could possibly get for the price I paid, and it's going to hold up for a long time [even with 92,000 miles already on it].
