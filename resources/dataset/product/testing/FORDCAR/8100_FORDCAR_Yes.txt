            I decided to lease my new 2000 Ford Explorer Sport for 24 months. My experience has been nothing but positive! The vehicle is extremely roomy for the driver and passenger and very comfortable for the quick trips to the supermarket and for the long drives across country. The only negative feedback is that I wish I had purchased my car instead of leasing it because I love it so much. 

Many times during this snowy winter in NY I have used the 4WD. It came in very handy going up the steep hills while all the cars were stuck in their paths.  It worked like a charm the first and every time I wanted to use it! The truck has more than enough power (I have the larger V6 engine) and the acceleration seems to be better than any other car I have ever driven. 

The heater and air conditioner work extremely fast. I dont even drive a mile before the heat starts pouring out of the vents. The radio has many options (a CD and tape player combined) and the quality of sound is amazing. I think I am in Carnagie Hall. Other ammenities include a separate control for the radio in the back seat and a separate vent and control for the heat and air conditioning in the back as well. One of the most useful little options is the 2nd electrical outlet that comes in handy near the floor of the passenger's side of the dashboard. Another feature that I love is the digital thermometer and compass near the rear view mirror. Lastly, the convienence of having the headlights come on automatically when it gets dark outside may seem useless, but really comes in handy when you are as forgetful as I am. 

A negative about the car is that it eats gas like crazy! I only get about 200-250 miles per tank and it costs me about $25 to fill it up. Additionally, insurance seems to be a little steep for this car, especially if you are in a higher risk catagory.

I have received many compliments about my vehicle and would recommend anyone that wants to show a little style and practicality, to purchase an Explorer. Not only is it an economical purchase, but is a stylish semi-luxery vehicle. I would defanitly take it out for a test drive.<br><br>
