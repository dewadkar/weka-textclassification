            I've had my Ford Windstar for about six months now and love it. I still have to remind myself that it's a van and not a car because it rides and drives so smooth. The two bucket seats in the front have arm rests and the two back bench seats do also including beverage holders for each. There are two beverage holders for the front seats as well.
There are seperate temperature controls for the rear seating and the driver has the option of either controlling the rear temperature if no one is riding along or letting the rear passengers control the temperature. This is really a great feature in a van because most of the time the front seat riders get warm before the rear passengers. 
This van also offers sliding doors on both sides which is a big help when carrying several passengers. The rear door even though very large, is easy to open because of the shocks and simple to close. It is surprisingly light and the storage behind the rear seat is plenty to handle a days shopping. The seats fold down with just a push of a handle allowing for increased cargo space with ease.
The stereo system is pretty good but not enough umph... I purchased a Bazooka Bass Tube with an amplifier and for me that was all I needed. Some people may want to add additional speakers with amplifiers for added bass but I'm not into the thumping. I would definetly recommend this van to any person who either has a large family or just needs the cargo space and wants to ride in comfort and style.
