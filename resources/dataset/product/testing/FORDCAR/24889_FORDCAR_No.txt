            This car has plently of power and handles well.  Also it is a pretty goos head turner in performance red.

Unfortunately, mine has been plagued with problems.  Furthermore, Ford (especially my dealership) has been very unreceptive and downright mean!  

I have bought Fords my entire life (expect for a little Toyota pickup once :)) and this will be my last.  It is unfortunate that this car was not tweaked a little more because3 it would be awesome.  

When I first bought it it wasn't even safe!  The car would accelerate to wide open throttle from a stop.  It was out of control!  The only way I could stop it was to turn the key off!  

After 16k though, Ford has been unable to trace other problems.  For instance the car dies a couple times a week at least, during deceleration!  It is embarassing and it is dangerous when it happens on a curve!  They did fix the horn on the second try though!  

Good car if you like to have a black box in your car and press a little button when you fear for your life!
