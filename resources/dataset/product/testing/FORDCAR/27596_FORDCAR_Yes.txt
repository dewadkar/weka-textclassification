            Ever since my wife's and kids' recent accident in her 1998 Toyota Corolla, we have been looking for a vehicle that can meet her needs.  Having an article about the 2001 Ford Escape, she decided to go test drive it.  Who am I to resist or put up a fight?  After all, she had all the reasons in the world why this Ford Escape with the side airbag option may be ther right intermediate SUV for her and the kids.  I also encouraged her to include these safety options in any new vehicle we will end up purchasing.  After all, they survived the recent side collision thanks to a side-air bag.

On a relatively breezy Summer afternoon, we trekked down to our nearest Ford dealership to take a good look at the 2001 Ford Escape on display.  As soon as we got there, we were swarmed or gazed by a five-group strong of car salespersons.  One of them was kind enough to help us find a parking spot.  The whole lot was full with SUVs waiting to exchange their Bridgestone/Firestone tires.  There was practically any spot to park our vehicle!  This recall caused the mechanics to be as busy as bees.  We walked out and asked about the location of a 2001 Escape.  In the meantime, my wife pulled out of her purse some printouts.  The salesperson led us to the only vehicle that the dealership had received.  Then, I quickly realized that it would be difficult for us to test drive it.  Two other interested parties were gawking at the newest Ford technology feast.

I turned around to pick up my son whose hard cast was recently removed.  He still limps.  The sales person opened the four doors of the vehicle.   It was a 3.0L Duratec six-cylinder/four-speed automatic 2001 Ford.  I checked the easy grips of the handles which can facilitate entry and exit from all the doors.  I looked at my wife's notes and realized that the 2001 Ford Escape comes in XLS and XLT trim, front-wheel drive or Control Trac II or full-time four-wheel drive system.

It is my opinion that all the predictions read in various magazines and web sites come to pass.  The Escape is a true intermediate SUV for the young as well as the young-at-heart.  My daughter exclaimed, &quot;Look at all the cupholders.  This one is for my mother.  This one is for my daddy.  My brother can place his in here.  And I can put my cup here...&quot; Seating is pretty comfortable front and rear.  I got in and pushed the driver's seat all the way to the back.  The 2001 Ford Escape offers enough storage areas.  It is a very ergonomic vehicle on the road.

We did ask whether we could test drive the vehicle.  The sales person was somewhat reluctant.  Maybe because this one was on display.  That's all they had.  &quot;How can we make up our mind if we don't have any idea of how the SUV drives?&quot; I asked.  The sales person excused himself and went to communicate with his floor manager.  He returned, &quot;He said you can drive it around the block.  Since it is on display.  We would like other customers to find it displayed.&quot;  My wife and I totally agreed with the manager.

We loaded up the kids and drove around the dealership for a few minutes.  The ride was smooth.  It has a car-like feel to it.  The 2001 Ford Escape comes equipped with these standard safety and security features:  

*  Dual front airbags, remote keyless entry, Ford Securilock engine immobilizer system and side intrusion door beams.  The XLT model we were testing adds four-wheel anti-lock brakes and front fog lamps.  Then, I would encourage you, potential buyers, to add a few good options such as driver and front passenger seat mounted side airbags and four wheel anti-lock brakes.

It is my prediction that this intermediate Ford Escape will be a huge hit on the American market.  Well, my wife and I still had to take a few other things into account.

I truly recommend it to you!
