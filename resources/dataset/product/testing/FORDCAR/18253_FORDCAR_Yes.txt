              I have a 1991 Ford Escort Wagon LX. It has over 138,000 miles on it, and it runs great! Personally, I think that Ford is the best kind of car that you can get. 
  Escorts themselves are a very popular brand of car though they are rather small. That is why the Ford Escort Wagon is so wonderful. It has the superior craftsmanship of Ford, the compact size of an Escort, but it also has a lot of storage room which for me, being a musician, is great, as I can pack everything along for the ride. 
  I bought the vehicle because of it's storage capacity. I love my car because even after 138,000 miles plus, it's running just as smoothly as a brand new car. 
  The type of person who I think should get this kind of car, is anyone who likes to travel but doesn't want to drive an RV around. Also anyone that likes to have a good time out driving because they know that they can drive and be safe while doing so. 
  I don't think there's any better brand than Ford. It's like my father says, I know how to work on Dodge, GMC, Chrysler, but I haven't got the faintest idea of how to work on a Ford. He's never had to work on one. So, if you're out in the vehicle market, go for a Ford Escort Wagon.<br><br>
