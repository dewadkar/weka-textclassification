            I recently purchased my second Escort Wagon (1999).  However, this time I opted for an automatic and had it fully equipped.  Overall, it is a good buy for the money - especially if you are able to get manufacture's incentives/rebates.  One thing I liked is that the car came with floor mats for no extra cost, unlike my last one (little things like that made happy!).  It has a minimal anti-theft system - I say minimal because it does not &quot;go off&quot; when it is bumped or the door handles are touched.  If you lock it with the remote and attempt to unlock it with the key, then the alarm goes off.  One nice feature is the panic button located on the remote.  I bought this vehicle because I had  very good experience with my previous one - which was totaled much sooner than I had intended to purchase another one.  It ran excellent, with only 1 minor problem that had to be corrected up until &quot;the end&quot; (~93,000 miles).  My only complaint about this car is the noise - it makes a lot of noise.  We were so concerned about it we took it to have it looked at and were told that for the 1999 model, part of the transmission was made out of plastic and is usually made out of some kind of metal.  Due to the high amount of noise and complaints, next years model will be made out of metal again.  I recommend this car for a small family - it is great for grocery shopping and travel!  In addition, if you have lower back problems, I do not recommend this car as my sister who has had disc surgery often complains that her back hurts while riding in and after riding in this car
