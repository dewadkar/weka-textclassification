            Hmm,,Let me think about this one. 2000 Ford Mustang coupe. Total panty dropper. With its sleak new styling and great power output, this car was built to get women. If you are 16 years old like I am, and love to race, this is definitely your car. There is NO better value for under 20,000. This car is my first, and will be my last. Ford has definitely gained my confidence in them after having driven this car. With my 0-60mph being only 6.9 i must say FAST!! Having already left, Camaro's, Eclipses, Integra's, Avengers, Cougars, Celicas, all in the dust. This is the car to have. My brother got himself a 2000 Celica gts, and i have him wishing he would have spent 2,000 dollars less and gotten himself a MUSTANG! After killing him in a drag race there were no doubts in my mind that this is the best car for under 20,000. I love the standard features like the CD player, rear defroster,power windows,doors, and locks, and just too many other things to list, this car is of great value. Fathers, this is the car you need to get your son. I have had it now for 6 months, except for the fact that I have too many girls and just too little time. The 40hp addition from the 98' models make this car the one of the fastest in its class. A great car for a great price, and thats all i got to say.

Weaknesses: Now, this car is definitely an eye catcher, but there is only one thing i could change and that is the sluggish start from first gear, but that can be fixed with a few modifications to the stock model. Nonetheless this car is super fast! I was running at 115mph in fourth gear and when i hit 5th it was barely past 3500rpms. The governor doesn't let you meet the cars maximum capabilities. The stock rims are ok, but if you want more women some 17inch chrome wheels are nicer.

My dad is a car enthusiast which is where i got my fervor for cars. 300zx, very nice car, still take a Stang over it for price and value, BMW 323i. Well, if you wanna pay 33,000 dollars for 20 less hp go ahead. The bmw and the stang are head in head in a race, the beemer just takes off quicker.  2000 celica gts, its cool and modern looking, but i don't know why it has 6 speeds, its not that fast, and sounds like a little mosquito engine while the Pitbull growl of the mustang just eats up that little i4 toyota. 2000 Corvette convertible, Well now i'd be stupid to compare these two cars. Acura NSX-only 84,000..you decide which is better I test drove and impreza. now that is honestly the car i wanted, because i'm sure its 0-60 could get to under 6.0 easy, but in terms of value, the Stang is where its at. 2000 Gti. This modified Volkswagon golf is the fastest hatchback i've ever ridden in. Nice car. 93 911/Carrera- Pops never lets me drive it so I couldn't tell ya
   
Nothing better than my 2000 Ford Mustang. Its a stock and can beat a 2000 GTS Toyota Celica. I paid 16,500 for mine during a great sale Ford had and the dealer was just great. I have great interest rates and paid NO MONEY DOWN. It doesn't get better than that. Gas mileage is not bad. I
went from St. Louis to Indianapolis in back on one tank of gas. Great sound out of this engine with 190hp output it doesn't get any better. The styling on this car is impecable. I love the new lights on it. The rims i got changed on it and women just love it. Cd player, remote keyless entry and trunk. It is a wonderful car. Great first car. Very fast with good insurance rates. No car like it. Used to hate Ford before I got in this baby, One of A Kind!!. Get it in the new Atlantic blue color it is the nicest color they got. Or the yellow, whichever you prefer. Highly recommended with a wonderful blend of styling and performance with a great touch of value. All in one. Buy it baby!! <br><br>
