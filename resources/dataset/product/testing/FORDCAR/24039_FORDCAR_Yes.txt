            I've owned my 97 Expedition since July 99. I Bought it as a lease return with @27,000 miles. It now has 107,000 miles and runs/drives as well as ever.

I love this truck (I refuse to use the term SUV) it is big and comfortable, stereo is great, it came with a dealer installed TV/VCR which the kids love. There is plenty of head/leg room in the second row for adults and plenty of room in the third seat as well. The 5.4 V-8 has LOTS of power.

As everyone has pointed out the gas mileage is lousy. I get @ 13mpg, the thing is though, it still gets 13mpg fully loaded with family, gear, AND pulling a loaded camper.

On the down side, it loves brake pads as much as it loves gas. So far I have replaced front pads 4-times rear pads 3-times and all four rotors once.

It has also broken the front sway-bar hold downs twice. And broke a tie-rod end (had the front suspension rebuilt at that point).

It has required no major repairs otherwise.

The paint has faded over time despite keeping it clean and waxed (its Maroon).

The leather seats have shown little wear over time however, the outside of the bottom drivers cushion was broken down when I bought the truck from the driver sliding out of the seat.

The rear axle pinion seal blew out last summer, but Ford replaced it and had it back to me within 24-hours for about $180.

Tire wear is good as long as you rotate them every 5000 miles. Getting ready to put on it's third set of tires.

I just bought a new 2003 Ford Ranger and plan to buy the wife a new car soon, but I will keep the Expedition for camping, towing, and general wintertime 4WD use.
