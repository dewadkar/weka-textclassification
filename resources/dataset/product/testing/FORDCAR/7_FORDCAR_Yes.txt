            My husband and I had seen an ad on the television here for a local dealer who was selling the Ford Taurus as a special. 

We were interested in looking for a newer car that was bigger because our family had just expanded.

As soon as I test drove this vehicle, I wanted it! My mom has a Taurus and I enjoyed driving hers so, when I test drove this one, I was eager to get it.

I was particularly impressed with this one model because it had a center console instead of a middle pull down seat for another passenger. It has two cup holders for the front seating and a change holder. It also has a big compartment that you can put a cd changer into and you can rest your arm on there when driving. There is also a cup holder in the back seat between the two front seats.

The car is really roomy and has plenty of room in the back seat for two car seats and an adult to sit in the middle comfortably.

The trunk is really big too. I can fit a double stroller and alot of other stuff back there. The back seat pulls down so you can have more trunk room if you are toting something big.

The gas mileage on this car is great. I fill it up about every 250 miles and it costs about $15 to do that.

I recommend this car to anyone with a family of four, or people who like bigger cars that are not too big.
