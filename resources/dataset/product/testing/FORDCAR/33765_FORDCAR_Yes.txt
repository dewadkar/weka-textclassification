            I've had my Ford Bronco for 2 years now.  While my wife wants to trade it in (not because she doesn't like it) she will have to pry my cold dead fingers from the steering wheel to hand it over as a trade to some dealership.

If you want an SUV that will make you feel like your riding in a LIMO this is for you.  Our XLT model has a V8 5.0L engine that kicks serious butt, and it doesn't matter how fast you take it you still feel like your're riding on air!

The XLT model is fully loaded, we have everything you can think of except power seats and a sunroof. The original price on the vehicle was around $20K, and it's still worth $19K on the resale market, talk about holding it's value!

The inside has leather seats, power everything (except seats), lumbar support, you name it.  It's very, very roomy and after a long drive you don't feel like slapping the person next to you, plus you'd have to reach way over to do it!

I also have horses and use the Broco to pull my two horse trailer. Handles this situation with ease!

We also do a lot of 4-wheeling, and even after one small &quot;incident&quot; this baby still handles really well.  You can beat 'em up pretty good!

The only thing I really don't like about my Bronco is the amount of gas it eats!  We only get around 10-14 mpg.  I guess that's not too bad for an SUV, but with prices the way they are it makes it a very expensive vehicle to drive.

This is a great SUV for anyone, you will get a lot of compliments on it, and people will always be asking you if it's for sale!  The only thing my wife and I agree on that's not really good about it, is the rear seat doesn't accommodate baby seats very well and it's difficult to get into the rear seat unless you are a very small person!

I recommend you take one for a drive if you are considering an SUV that will hold it's value, is hard to find, and a lot of fun to drive!<br><br>
