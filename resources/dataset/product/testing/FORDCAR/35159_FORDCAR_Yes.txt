            Dear Friend,
  I have owned a 1999 Ford Escort for about a year now.  I love it.  Granted it will not survive any type of off-roading, heavy loading, or engine racing but it does what it was supposed to do, it drives.  It also has been a blessing ever since the gas prices started to increase dramatically.  
  This car has a generous amount of trunk space and is comfortable on shorter trips in the backseat.  The front two seats are very comfortable and do well on long trips.  I know this because I travel 750 miles one way to go to school.  My father(6'2&quot;, 350+lbs) who has ridden with me on a number of shorter trips also enjoys the head and leg room.  
  All in all this car is obviously worth the money!  The cost of maintaining after your purchase make it economical also.  The Ford Escort comes only in different variations of 4 cyl.  engines so the owner must be sure to keep the oil changed at least every 5,000 miles if not sooner.    <br><br>
