            The SVT Cobra is smooth, quiet and civilized... and would have easily outrun the GT-350. It's the product of Ford's elite Special Vehicle Team (SVT), which has modified a limited number of Ford cars and trucks since 1993. The vehicles are sold through some 600 Ford dealers trained to sell and service them. The coupe version of the SVT Cobra has a $25,710 base price, while the convertible costs $28,510. As with all Mustangs, the racy looking SVT Cobra has just average front room for two tall occupants and a 6 footer will find the driver's seat doesn't slide back far enough from the pedals. The backseat is strictly for kids. Although small, the usefully shaped trunk will swallow a fair amount of soft luggage for weekend getaways. The SVT Mustang Cobra is one of those cars that makes owners look for excuses to take such trips.
