            I bought a 1995 econoline 250 in Sept. of 95 brand new. I use it for my plumbing business.  Overall this van has been good value.  The plusses are
comfort, nice style,  reliable.  The negatives are minor problems (mostly electrical),  10 MPG(in line 6cyl).  In 5 years and 90,000 miles I've replaced ignition switch (2X)*, oil pressure switch*, rear axle seal*, heater blower*, fuel pump (inside gas tank)*, u joints. ((* done under or partially under warrantee ))  Room for improvement: smaller turning radius, more supports to attatch shelving to in rear cargo area, whats with Ford ignition switch?  

By way of comparison,  I also bought a used 89 toyota pick up at the same time, and with similar mileage- the only costs on the toyota were normal maintenance (oil, fuel filter, brakes, etc.)  Waiting for Toyota to come out with a full size van.  Overall the van is good value and plan to drive it another 5 years.<br><br>
