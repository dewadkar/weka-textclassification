            Leased a 2001 Ford Windstar LX, maintenance package, daytime running lights (safety package), etc. We really want to like this vehicle but the number of irritations makes it impossible. Soem are the quality of the vehicle some are dealer together they generate a very bad ownership experience.

First it is a Gas Guzzler (13 MPG--dealer [Ford of Upland, CA] says so what). The electronics are sloppy, the Auto Mirrors, Seats, and Day Running Lights Don't Work. The Memory adjustments for the seats and mirrors reset to neutral every time you hit the unlock button. Dealer says, "Just reprogram" why have memory if you have to adjust them each time you get in? 

The day running lights generate an error on the dash that must be canceled to view mileage etc. every time you start the van. Air conditioner makes a loud clunk when you first turn it on. Poor controls on the onboard video system. Seats are very heavy and hard to get in and out. 

Purchased the regular maintenance package on the basis of Oil Change is same as Quick Lube Service--Our first oil change we had to leave the van for 5 hours. FORD has very poor quality control over dealers.

Our 4th FORD Van with each FORD has gotten worse - our last.
