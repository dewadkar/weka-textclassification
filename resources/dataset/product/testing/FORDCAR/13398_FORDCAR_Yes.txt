            I have owned the 1992 1/2 Limited Edition 5.0 LX Mustang for about a year now and I must say that it still turns heads going down the road!  I was lucky enough to run across a model that has very low mileage for the year (only 50,000 miles) and the paint was still in great shape.  

The Limited Edition model produced only 2,019 total vehicles.  The VIN # will not tell you if you have the LI but it has some definite giveaways.  First is the white leather seats with black trim.  Second is the Vibrant Red color of the paint with a white convertible top and white wheels.  If your car has all these features, then you've come across the LI model!  

I recently had my AOD transmission replaced because 2nd gear was completely burnt out.  The new transmission is amazing and I feel like I've gained about 25 HP from it!  The car has never run smoothly due to Ford's poor design of the suspension system so watch out when you hit those potholes, it will not produce any shock absorption.  The car also gets poor gas mileage.  I live in the city and rarely get more than 12-15 MPG city driving.  Open road on the other hand, I have produced close to 25 MPG.  The car also has poor handling in the snow due to the power that the car possesses and the fact that it is real-wheel drive.  Even a few times on the rain-slicked roads have I felt a little out-of-control with the vehicle.  

After getting past the above mentioned problems, I must say that this car is still my baby and I take great care of it because of the value that it still holds.  You've got to expect problems like poor bad-weather handling with any car and just get passed it, because once someone is usually a Mustang fan they will stay one for life.  Myself included.  If you are lucky enough to run across the LI edition from 1992, pick it up...take care of it...and only 15 more years it will become a classic.
