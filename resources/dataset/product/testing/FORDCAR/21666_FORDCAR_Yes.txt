            Our 95 is the second Aerostar for my family.  My first was a 3.0 1990 bought used the day my son was born in 1995.  In November of 1999 my wife and 2 children were broadsided by a driver going 45mph at an intersection.  The van was spun around and went up on 2 wheels before coming back down.  With over 186,000 miles on it, it was totaled.  Because of the Ranger subframe the Aerostar is built on the car was stopped from entering into the passenger area and rupturing the fuel tank.  There were no reportable injuries from my family.  We searched for nearly 2 weeks until we found our current 95 4.0 All Wheel Drive Extended Van.  The Aero is very roomy.  We have used it to move furniture, appliances and lumber.  We recently took a 2500 mile vacation with 3 adults and 2 children and had more than enough room for all to have their own space.  I have averaged 20mpg under varying driving conditions from sustained 75mph on the highway to climbing through the Colorado mountains with 7 people.  While my 3.0 had better mileage, I expected this with the 4.0 and 4 Wheel Drive and extra weight.  My only expenses outside of normal maintenance was a worn out transmission on my 90.  This was my fault by not checking the fluids as recommended.  This occured at nearly 150,000 miles.  My 95 is running perfectly.<br><br>
