            After a Jeep Grand Wagoneer and 3 Ford Broncos, it was time to look for a new SUV. My last Bronco was an Eddie Bauer 1990 with a 5.0L and AOD with pushbutton 4WD. Unable to find a late model Bronco, I started looking at Explorers (I am a diehard Ford lover). Being a large person, 6'2&quot; at 250#, I soon discovered that Explorers were too tight for me. I didn't think I could afford an Expedition, even used, on my budget, but came across a used 1998 XLT 4X4 just at the max of my price range.
After the test drive home to see if it fit in my garage it was evident that I had to have this truck. The dealer offered me more than I was expecting to get for my Bronco and it was home with the Expedition. The entire family loves it.
The vehicle is loaded, 5.4L SOHC V8, E4OD, power seat, 3rd row seat, privacy glass, Class3 towing package, AM/FM Cassette with 6disc CD changer, 17&quot; alloy wheels, and the list goes on.
Of the 5 4X4s I have owned, this one by far is the best. The ride is very quiet, the 5.4L has power to spare, the manueverability is unbelievable for such a large vehicle. The stereo system is top notch, as is the vast roominess of the interior. The vehicle just fit into the garage (6'6&quot; overhead door) after removing the roof rack. 
I am a paid-on-call firefighter/paramedic and am used to driving the usual Suburbans the Fire Department has owned over the years. Our latest is 1 year old and has the 350&quot; V8. My Expedition can run rings around the Suburban, and is much quieter in ride and running down the road.
We recently towed our 25' travel trailer to South Dakota and to Michigan, and the big rig performed flawlessly. Power was there with more to spare, even in the Black Hills. Fuel economy averaged 12.5 MPG pulling the 5,000# trailer. This is a great family vacation vehicle. I can't say enough good things about this vehicle.
The only problem I had was on my birthday. I walked out into the parking lot at work and the Expy was leaning at an angle. While the truck was just sitting in the lot the right torsion bar had cracked in three places. Also when I started it up the check engine light was on ! A trip to the local Ford dealer replaced the torsion bar and the number 4 coil on plug ignition coil. There is a problem with coolant from the heater hose spraying on the #4 COP when a hole is rubbed through the heater hose. What a coincidence ! Happy Birthday. The truck was only in the shop a day and has been running great ever since. (The gas mileage went up about another 2 MPG after the COP was replaced).The company I work for has a metalurgical lab and it seems the torsion bar problem stems from the heattreating process for the torsion bar.The wife can't wait to get it paid off so she can trade in her E-150 conversion van for one.
