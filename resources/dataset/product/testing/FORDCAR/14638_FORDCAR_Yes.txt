            While SUVs have become increasingly more popular on the road these days, don't be sucked in just yet.  

(short) SUV RANT

OK, I know that some people genuinely need the cargo or the off-road capability of these things, but really does every other vehicle on the road need to be an SUV?  I mean while it is true that you can find some comfort in driving one of these trendy vehicles for its sheer bulk, how safe are they really?  Generally they don't handle all that well.  They are mostly built on the chassis of pick-up trucks and consequently are top heavy (re: tip over too much).  Newer cars on the road are becoming safer all the time, and I will spend some time talking about the Ford Focus' safety features.   And by promoting the use of these large vehicles, you are really engaging in a kind of vehicular arms race, as other drivers will feel the need to protect themselves from the metal behemoths.  SUVs are gas guzzling too, my sisters Blazer is only 20 mpg on highways (driving conservatively).   And isn't the environment in bad enough shape, not even mentioning the savings that could be gained by more fuel efficiency.

WAGONS RISING
While I was tempted myself by the masculine appeal of these things, my practical side wouldn't let me fall prey to it.  While cargo space is something I genuinely value, having a dog and often several passengers, I have come to realize the wagon as a real credible alternative. They can be sporty, they don't roll like rover begging for a treat, and you will get much better fuel efficiency.  

FOCUS on FORD
When I hopped in the Focus Wagon SE, I was pleasantly surprised.  It felt cushy and spacious.  The controls were well placed and there was a great deal of visibility around the car.  The cargo area was really tremendous, as there was lots of room for my dog and 4 passengers.  It gets 34 MPG highway and actually has a decent amount of acceleration.  Having test driven several here are my specific observations

POWER
The 2.0 L Zetec engine was able to provide good acceleration off the blocks as well as ample push at higher speeds.  I was able to cruise at 80mph without feel the tremble of the car or the whorl of the engines.  It will give you 130 HP at a respectable 5300 RPM. 

HANDLING
Its surprisingly good.  I found a subdivision underdevelopment where the roads were done but houses weren't.  It was like my own personal race track :).  The large tires were able to grab the road well.

BRAKES
I was able to come to a quick stop without any lock up.  I would recommend the ABS if you can afford it.  Especially if you live in an area where traction is an issue (rain or snow).   If you are on the fence on this issue, try one with and one without and do a lot of sudden braking.  I am pretty sure you will feel a difference.  

CARGO
I am 6 feet tall and I felt comfortable in the front and back seats.  It has almost 19 cu ft of cargo in the rear.  That will carry lots of groceries.  It also has a luggage rack on the roof, which you can add a bike rack or ski rack if you so wished.  

LOOKS
While aesthetics is purely a matter of taste, I would suggest that the sleek look of the focus wagon gives it a sporty look.  Certainly the Focus has a different shape, but I would revel in the difference rather than be repulsed by it.  The interior looks clean and the gauges are well placed.

STANDARD FEATURES
The standard features are indeed impressive:  Power locks, windows, remote entry, AC, rear heating ducts (nice touch), CD Player and cruise control.  


OK this guy is loaded.  I will admit that I didn't buy it, mostly because of financial reasons, but this car is the next car that I buy.  For those that are somewhat tempted by the allure of an SUV, ask yourself what you need from it and consider if this wagon would make a reasonable substitute.  I loved this car and highly recommend it to those needing cargo space, a nice ride at a budget price.
