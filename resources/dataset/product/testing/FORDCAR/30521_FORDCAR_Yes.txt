            I bought this 99 F350 4x4 Crew Cab to pull a 54 foot gooseneck trailer.  It does it amazingly well, considering the trailer weighs around 18K pounds.  This is a beast of a truck, very stable and smooth while cruising at interstate speeds.  The truck has the tried and true 7.3 Powerstroke with turbo, and has adequate torque to pull this much weight.  A 4:10 gear with Overdrive lets this truck cruise at 75 mph while turning 2400 rpm, which is the rpm range it seems to do its best in.  I can set the cruise control, and unless a steep grade comes up, it will never come off.  Although I haven't driven a manual, from talking to the people that have one, it may be the way to go, if pulling large loads over 10K.  This sensors for this truck seem set to high, that is, when pulling a large hill, it will kick out of Overdrive and a second later the cruise kicks off.  I wish it would come out of overdrive sooner, maybe I wouldn't have to re-set the cruise.  The only other bad thing is when it does kick out of overdrive and crest the hill, sometimes it wants to stay in drive, and you have to turn it on and off (Fords are equipped with electronic overdrive), either that or it gets the &quot;hiccups&quot;, it stays in overdrive and when it crests the hill, it gets very confused when the throttle pressure eases back.  These are isolated events, and don't happen all the time.  The only real complaint I have had with the truck is the brakes sounding like they are going to lock up.  The front tires &quot;cry&quot; when stopping, with or without the trailer. It went to the dealer, but the mechanic said he tore all 4 wheels down and couldn't find any problem.  In closing, the best way I judge things is would I spend my money again for this truck ?  Without a doubt.  Best Wishes.<br><br>
