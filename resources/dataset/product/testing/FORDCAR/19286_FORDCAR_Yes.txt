            Ford Contour is roomy, speedy, family. My Contour is a GL model with  15'inch wheels not hub caps. The drivers window is express down power window, power door lock, power moonroof. The ABS system works great, I never rear ended anyone for the ABS system. Gas mileage could be improved a bit although Ive gone from Beltsville, MD to South of the Boarder (SC) on one tank. The Contour delivers a sufficient amount of power under the hood. The car is very roomy and you can get three adults sized people in  the back seat. The leg room in the front is equally as spacious as the rear. Trunk room is also very spacious. The overall performance is excellent.      <br><br>
