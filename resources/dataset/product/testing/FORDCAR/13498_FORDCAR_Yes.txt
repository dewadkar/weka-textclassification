            Ford Explorer:  I love it.

First off, I have two children -- ages 3 and 9 months.

Second, I am not the 'minivan' type.

Third, I like camping and other outdoor activities.

I was a little bit leary of getting an Explorer at first because of the difficulty involved in getting children in car seats strapped in -- but that has turned out to be a non issue.

The kids love the truck, and in our cold climate (Minnesota) the back seat climate control is great.  The truck heats up fast.

The cargo capacity is good -- not great, but adequate -- and any growing family is always hauling strollers, large toys, outdoor toys, furniture, etc.  And when the kids are not along, the truck is fun to take a bit off the beaten track.

Because it is so heavy, it is also very safe in traffic.

If you are considering a SUV, check out the explorer.  It is built tough and I have had no maintenance problems whatsoever with it.
