1993 Ford Crown Victoria
Color- Mocha (light tan)
No major problems, yet.

As you can tell I am not a car person, I don't know what all the parts of the engine are called. I call them gismos and gadgets, and you know, the round thingy that looks like a donut, etc. 

I  do know my Crown Vic, has a V-8 engine, power locks, windows and seats, a cassette player and radio. It does not have ABS brakes,and only a drivers side airbag. Now, please forgive me if I am not that technical when describing my car, but I will try my best and hopefully get the point across. Read on...

After being involved in a pretty serious accident in which my ford Taurus 
was totaled. I wanted a BIG car in which I felt safe. I drove a Crown Victoria and was immediately hooked. I loved it.

 It provides a great ride, nice and smooth, handles great, braking took a bit to get use to, takes longer to stop because it so much heavier than other cars I had driven. I am a short person, five foot two inches , and I am easily able to adjust the seat to my size without being right up on the steering wheel.

There is tons of room in the trunk, and I mean tons! My teenage son shows all his friends the trunk and the engine. Everyone thinks this is a old granny car, but let me tell you, it can kick butt!(not that I am advising
this) 

I can fit my two teens, a carseat and toddler in it and still have plenty of room. I have had mine for three years and I am quite happy with it.


 For those of you use to little cars, it might take a bit to get use to a big car, parking is a little fun at first,(LOL) after awhile you can whip in and out just like your driving a tidbit car. The biggest problem I found was finding used ones, there aren't many out there.  

As for overall condition, the paint job is still in good shape, a few spots of peeling paint around the bumpers. The interior is in nice shape.The fabric on the seat is still in one piece, no holes, only a few stains, courtesy of my little one.

I do wish there were cup holders in this car, that is my biggest complaint. The knobs and switches are still together and work with no problem. 

One last note, this car is a GAS GUZZLER, it normally takes about $20.00 t0 $25.00 to fill the tank up, this obviously depends on the price of gas.
Now I only drive mine around town, you know , the mom's taxi deal, so the $$$ is not a big deal. For those of you who have a long drive to work, this might cause a problem if you are a penny pincher. Beware.

All in all, I like this car and think it is a good value.
