            I have had my 2000 Windstar LX for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it.  The only options I got were the upgraded stereo/CD system and 2nd row buckets seats.

The van handles very well and the ride is smooth.  It comes with outlets in front and back for plugging in TVs, cell phones, whatever.  The 2nd row bucket seats fully recline, and each has a cup holder attached to the side.  The bucket seats also fold down and have a smooth surface and cup holder for a table for 3rd row passengers.

All of the driver controls are easily accessible.  There is a compartment in the middle under the stereo area for storing items, but it is not real convenient because there is no door or closure and things slide out.  The glove compartment is roomy however.
  
The one feature that I love about this van is the stereo system.  There are rear passenger controls that allow those passengers to listen to a different music medium than the driver.  There are 2 earphone outlets for this purpose.  Anyone traveling with small children will understand the importance of this feature.

There are also rear passenger controls for air/heat.  The back area heats up really quickly, and you don't have to worry about the driver suffocating from heat just so his back seat passengers can be warm.
If I had to do it over again, I would have gotten the automatic sliding door feature.  I thought I could do without it, but there have been several times that I wished I had it.  If you can afford it, go for this feature.

Another nice feature is with the driver side passenger sliding door.  There are controls you can set so that this door cannot be opened from the inside.  This is very important for parents of small children who may jump out of the car into moving traffic.

Overall, I would highly recommend this van.  You get alot of good quality features for a fair price.    <br><br>
