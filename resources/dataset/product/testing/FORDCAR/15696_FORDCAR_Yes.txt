            I bought a 1995 windstar 11 months ago, I loved it because it was a van that I could step into without hurting my knees . It was just the right height just to step into.
But a week later I wished I had never bought it.It ran hot on the way home from the dealer, towed to the dealer. 4 more times ,it was fixed and 4 more times it was towed in.Running hot each time. For the first 6 weeks I was in a rental car, they ended up doing a valve job. The following week it was back in because it wouldn't go out of 1st gear.All in all, in 10 months it has had 2 valve jobs, 2 rebuilt transmissions,serpentine belt and pulley, tie rods, battery, radiator redone, and power steering pump. along with reg. oil changes alignments etc. Now it sets in the yard with no compression in the motor, power steering still making a racket and I still owe $10,600.00 on the darn thing.
Doing a run down of what all it had done before I bought it, it had already had one valve job so that makes 3 all togeather.
The ford Co. has asked me to bring it in there tomorrow and see what they can do.,I'm at loose ends not being able to pay any higher payments then what I already have. And have drove vans all the time and now am scared to get a windstar , that's for sure.
I hope no one else has had so much fun with theirs.  Aurelia<br><br>
