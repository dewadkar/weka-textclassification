            I fell in love with the Expedition the first year it came out.  I didn't get to buy one until 1998.  I was previously driving a Ford Explorer.

I have a red Eddie Bauer edition, with the small v-8.

I only have three complaints about the vehicle.

1.  the rear window leaks.

i've taken it in and they've replaced the gasket, but it still leaks.  i have yet to take it in again.

2.  i like my old Explorer seats!

in my explorer, i had seats with an extension on them that could be pulled out towards the bend in your knees.  I LOVED THIS!  i have very long legs and loved to have the seat actually FIT my legs.  they did not make the seats when i bought the Expedition.  now i feel like my legs are falling off the seat.

3.  putting gas in the car takes FOREVER

it doesn't take forever because the tank is so big (manual says 26 gallons).  typically, the pump shuts off automatically around 10 gallons SHORT of being full.  i have to trickle in the last several gallons.  also, i have been close to empty and filled up with OVER 32 gallons of gasoline.... and it's supposed to have a 26 gallon tank?  i HATE putting gas in the car because it usually takes around 15 minutes (or 20) to fill up when it has less than 1/4 tank left.

other than those three things, i LOVE my car!  i would definitely buy another one in a heart beat!
