            and so do I  since he leased his 1997 Ford F150 extended cab truck. It only had 17,000 miles on it and was in excellent shape. He has the 4x4 off road package on his truck. This truck is so comfortable to ride and drive. We enjoy riding in it on long trips. There is enough room for 6 people to ride. We have the 3rd door but I am sure it is nice to have the 4th door option available now. The gas mileage is kind of low but the truck is well worth the extra money spent on gas. Comfort is everything!!
The only bad thing is its high off the ground and difficult for short people and kids to get in. My husband installed step bars to make it easier for us to get in. I would highly recommend this Ford.<br><br>
