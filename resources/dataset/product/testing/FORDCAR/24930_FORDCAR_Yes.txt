            This vehicle has a sporty appearance as most people can tell.  By looking at it you can feel yourself zooming down the road in this blast from the past.  I was skeptical in purchasing this vehicle because of its troubled past with gas tank problems.  Often seen as a car for teenagers who want to outsport their peers in a drag race.  But i was surprised when I drove the vehicle for the first time and its comfyness and luxurious amenities overwhelmed the sporty feel that one can get when sitting in the driver's seat.  Then you hit the interstate and you can tell why this is &quot;America's Sports Car&quot;.  The gear shift has a sporty feel and it moves easily as you shift from 4th to 5th gear.  The rev of the engine proves its power that this vehicle contains.  
This vehicle is full of surprises and is great for adults of all ages.  Since the purchase of my '99 Mustang i have seen many people driving this vehicle and not many frowns in those cars.  This is also a good car for anyone of any age because it is affordable.  The standard model has such amenities like CD player, power windows, power locks, and 
extra power adapter for car phone.  Other extras include spoiler, fog lights and a sport package including alloy wheels.  The key fobs that come with the car include door lock and unlock commands, a panic button and a trunk eject button.  The one irritating problem that i have found with this car is that it's cup holders and not placed in an appropriate area.  The cup-holder that holds smaller cup sizes gets in the way of the gear shift, which creates a large problem for me, someone who spends most of his time eating in his car.  Which brings up another positive aspect of the new mustang.  A few months after my purchase I spilled a 32 oz. soda in the passenger seat.  I started to get upset but i grabbed the large amount of napkins in my car that i had, and the soda was soaked up without leaving a stain.  The scotch guard really worked. The gas mileage is mediocre traveling in town all day you may find yourself filling up every few days, but one weekend trip 100 miles away can last a long time.  Mileage during travel for daily activities, between fill-ups are about 260 miles, but on the highway it may take 300 miles before you have to fill-up again.
