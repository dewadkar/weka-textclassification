            I am not an SUV person. I never have liked them, and probably never will. They simply involve too many trade-offs relative to cars.

Still, I was intrigued by the Ford Escape. It was engineered largely by Mazda on a car chassis, with the priority being on-road drivability. So this might be the one to win me over. When my sister expressed interest in an SUV to handle the Boston winters, a test drive was in order.

The Escape is styled to look like a small Explorer. The overall look is sporty with a some amounts of both cuteness (the roundness of most lines) and aggressiveness (the front bumper) tossed in. The bumpers are unpainted gray urethane to give it an off-road look that probably exceeds its capabilities. For a different look, check out the Mazda Tribute. Though basically the same vehicle, the Mazda has an edgier, more car-like exterior, with fender flares and painted bumpers. I personally prefer the Ford, though my sister liked the Mazda better.

The interior is conventional Ford SUV in appearance, with the exception of the white-faced gauges. Since these were introduced by Nissan with the 1989 Maxima SE, they've been springing up inside many cars that aspire to be thought of as sporty. They certainly appealed to my sister. If you like them, chalk up one point for the Ford. The Mazda has conventional dark gauge faces.

The fabric in the Ford is a vinylized finely ribbed cloth that feels and looks very durable. My father liked it (we picked him up half-way through the test drive), my sister preferred the car-like velour in the Mazda. It's that car-truck thing again.  The Escape is simply styled in and out to be more of a truck. If you want a more luxurious interior but also want the Ford, then get the leather. We sat in an Escape with leather and it certainly lent the vehicle a more luxurious air.

This interior is very functional. There is plenty of room in both the front and rear seats. I haven't sat in the back of an Explorer in some time, but if memory serves the rear seat of the Excape is roomier than that in the larger Explorer. And that in the Grand Cherokee and Blazer, for that matter.  There's a good deal of room back there. Best of all, the rear seat cushion is high off the floor, providing good thigh support. I hate rear seats that are too low, so your legs flop to the side. In either set of seats there was a good half-foot of air between the top of my head and the roof.

There's plenty of room for stuff, too. There is a huge center storage compartment between the front seats. The rear seat folds flat in two sections to create a nice square cargo area. There is less cargo room than in mid-size SUVs, but most people will find it adequate.

A minor concern is the complexity of the rear seat. You must remove the headrest, then tilt the cushion forward, then fold the seatback down. The mechanism that allows the seat cushion to pivot felt a bit flimsy to me. If the owner is careful, though, it should hold up.

Seat comfort is OK in front, marginal in back. The front seats feel pretty good, leaving no lasting impressions either way. The rear seatback and cushion are both quite flat to enable the seat to fold flat. As a result, this seat, despite the amount of room available, may prove uncomfortable for some riders on long trips. 

Now we come to the important part: how does it drive? The engine comes from Ford. It is the same 3.0 liter found in the Taurus. At 200 horsepower, it is far more powerful than the 2.0 liters in the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. From a stop, it launches quite strongly, giving the impression of more than enough power. As speed increases, the not inconsiderable weight and frontal area of the vehicle begin to take their toll. This may be a compact SUV, but it still weighs about 3500 lbs. and stands about 68 inches tall. So by the time the Escape passes 40 MPH the engine begins to feel a bit winded (though no doubt much less so than the fours in the competition). 

The noise the engine makes does not help.  When pushed, the Ford V6 makes a lot of noise, and this noise is not good noise. Some engines when they make noise invigorate the driver, they say &quot;this is performance machinery&quot; and beg to be pushed harder. The Ford engine's noise says, &quot;I'm strained, please ease off.&quot; 

I find this a bit puzzling.  This 3.0 liter is a larger version of the 2.5 liter in my Contour. The 2.5 liter is also a noisy engine, but the noise it makes is very different, of the former kind. I love the way my engine sounds. The two engines have totally different intake manifolds, so this is probably the source of a lot of the difference.

While we're on the subject of noise, I should say that noise is probably the #1 weakness of the Escape.  There is simply too much of it. I've already talked enough about the engine. Then there are the tires, which make more noise on some surfaces than are others, but are never silent. Some wind noise is also present at even moderate speeds.  Add all of this noise up, and the Escape says &quot;truck.&quot; If you want a luxurious vehicle, then this is not your SUV.

This is a shame, because the Escape rides quite well for an SUV. Because it has a unibody, the body-on-frame shudders present in many conventional SUVs are absent here. The all-indpedent suspension, another departure from conventional SUVs, soaks up most bumps quite well. It never rocked side to side or front to back, characteristics present in many other SUVs.

Handling is also respectable--for an SUV. The Escape does not lean as much as its high driving position suggests it should. Though hardly BMW-like, the steering has a decent amount of heft and precision to it--unlike other Ford trucks I've driven, which have had overly light steering. But this is still an SUV. You sit very high in it. This might be a compact SUV, but the people who designed it understood that many people buy SUVs buy them so they can sit high up. While this affords excellent visibility all around, the resulting high center of gravity never stops feeling a touch unnatural to someone used to driving cars. You'll never feel like you're driving anything but an SUV.

I cannot fully evaluate the four-wheel-drive, since I did not take the Escape off-road or drive it in nasty weather. The system has two settings, Auto and On. In auto, the vehicle sends power through the front wheels until they start slipping.  Then it automatically directs power to the rear wheels. This type of system, similar to that in the Honda CR-V, is not intended for serious off-roading, but for driving on wet or snowy roads. To give it a bit of a test, I took the vehicle onto a wide gravel shoulder and gave the accelerator, brakes, and steering a work-out. In this minor test the Escape remained very easy to handle. I could not detect an slippage in the front wheels, nor could I tell when power was transferred.  The operation of the system was transparent, as it should be. For extended operation on slippery surfaces, just turn the switch to &quot;On.&quot; There is no low range, so I wouldn't expect it to do well as a serious off-roader. For serious off-road use,look at the more trucky alternatives like a Cherokee or Xterra.

Overall, the Escape is a nice package as long as you don't desire a serene ride. It is roomy front and rear, has more pep than the competition, and tops out at only $25k. The one I drove was generously equipped and cost only $23k. It might not be perfect, but for this price I give it an extra star. For a slightly more car-like, more luxurious package, check out the Mazda Tribute. But if you're in the mood for a highly competent, inexpensive SUV, I'd suggest just accepting the Escape for what it is--a truck--and giving it some serious consideration. <br><br>
