            I initially bought this car for my wife to use while I was at work, but I find myself driving this car more often than my wife.  I really enjoy driving this car.  It rides smoothly and has enough power to tackle those mountains without hesitation.  I was pretty surprised how it handles mountains.  Here is what it comes with:

ENGINE

The engine is a 2.0L DOHC Zetec Four Cylinder Engine, with automatic transmission.  This little engine packs quite a punch.  I&#146ve driven this car on two long trips since I&#146ve had it and the engine performed remarkably.  I drove from Mississippi to Arizona and from Mississippi to Indiana, only stopping for gas and food on both trips.  I maintained an average speed of 75 MPH on both trips and averaged a little over 30 miles to a gallon of gas, which isn&#146t bad for a sports car.  The car also handles great.  It's turn radius is very good.  It will make very quick turns and doesn't need a lot of room to make a turn.

INTERIOR

Comes with dual airbags, one on the driver&#146s side and one on the passenger side.  I&#146m 6&#146 tall and this car has more than enough leg room and head room for me.  My car came with Cruise Control, Tilt Steering Wheel, automatic side-view mirror adjuster, and manual window and door locks.  Since it was a second car, I didn&#146t see the need for all the nice amenities, such as power everything.  Besides with the deal I got, I couldn&#146t pass it up.  It has all the typical gauges like, fuel, temperature, speedometer, and a tachometer.  It also has the following warning lamps:
Service Engine Soon 
Check Fuel Cap
Brake System Warning Light
Anti-Lock Brake System
Air Bag Readiness
Safety Belt
Charging System
Engine Oil Pressure
Low Fuel
Turn Signal
High Beams
Key-In-Ignition Warning Chime
Headlamps on Warning Chime

It comes with and AM/FM stereo and CD player with all the typical stereo buttons.  It also has Air Conditioning and Rear Defroster.  

EXTERIOR

This car came with Fog Lights and a Rear Spoiler.  It looks really sporty.  It came with regular tires and rims, but they really don&#146t look that bad.  

I was very surprised by this car.  It performs much better than I expected, especially for the price that I paid for it.  If I had a teenager, this is the car I would buy them.  There is only one problem that I have with this car.  The insurance is a little more expensive because it is a sports car, but other than that I am totally happy with this car.
