            It's been years since I've owned anything that could describe itself as a sports car ( have owned 2 other 'Stangs - 1967 &amp; 1979) and although the last car I owned that came close, a 1972 240Z,had much more &quot;top end&quot;, nothing I've been in recently compares to the pure adrenilene rush this car gives me.
I have the 5 spd coupe, pretty much base model. I've added a K&amp;N filter and cut back the air silencer so I figure I've got a few more than the list 190 horses. I've had the car up to 115 mph in 4th at about 4200 rpm's so I'm sure it will bury the 120 mph speedometer (only thing that kept me from hitting 120 was my fear of breaking the speedo). Very little noise, almost as smooth as a $35,000 B'mer, definetly quieter.
The car handles about as well as my Z did, but I've noticed that with too much tire inflation it tends to drift in hard turns - especially 90 degree ones. I'm not a &quot;street racer&quot;, but I'm pretty sure this car will atleast do 0-60 in the 7 second number I've seen published - quite a bit faster than a '98 GT convertible! There are plenty of cars in the 7-8 second range, but I doubt if many will give you the pure rush a Mustang will.
(Am I starting to sound like a future Cobra owner...?)
Cons - I smoke and the ash tray sucks! I agree with the complaints regarding the trunk opening (then again, I don't plan on murdering anyone soon). The cup holders are ridiculously small and low so be sure to find something else to drink from besides the cup you get from the fast food chains. Mechanically, I've redlined 1st gear several times, engine turns into a blender sounding thing, but I've seen no indication of any serious engine damage. I'm averaging about 23 mpg and that's throwing 2 or 3 hard, high speed runs into each tankful of regular unleaded.
The GT or Cobra might give you more bragging rights, but for pure fun (and a pocket full of spare gas money) this car is definetly the ticket!<br><br>
