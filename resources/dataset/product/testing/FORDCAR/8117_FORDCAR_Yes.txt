            I recently was given a new sport to drive for work.  The sport has been our company car for some time now, and I was looking forward to the new model as it has been restyled.  First impressions for me are not good in comparison to the last few years models.
  My first few points are fairly minor and are more a personal preference than anything so take what you like from these comments.  I am sure as many people will like these changes as dislike and I am sure that Ford has plenty of research to refute my feelings.  
  1.  The new version has some cheesy metallic interior features on the door handles and instrument panel.  My guess is this is only in the sport
  2.  The gauges are also black on white which I like during the day but the green lighting at night is not that effective.
  3.  This truck seems noisier to me than the 98 I was driving.
  4.  I have already encountered 2 very annoying bugs in my truck- the gate will not latch properly on one side without repeated closing. attempts and my left signal lamp has stopped blinking, leaving a steady light.  Hopefully these issues will be straightened out as more are built but I have only had this truck for 3 weeks!
     I am also not a big fan of the lack of room in this truck. I have a passat and could carry twice as much stuff in it than in this.  Definetly go for the 4 door if you have anything to tote!
    On the plus side, I do like the exterior styling changes and new seats from my previous 98. To this point, the seats are more comfortable and the styling is much more aggressive.  Looks like they borrowed from the Navigator a bit.  I am also a big fan of the standard cd player and sound system.  They also seem to have improved the turning radius on this model year,it is pretty easy to street park this truck.
  Please keep in mind that my use of this vehicle is in the city and I do not have a 4x4, probably not the use Ford had in mind when designing this vehicle. So, like I said before, take this review with a grain of salt and know that I have never been a big fan of the Explorer.
