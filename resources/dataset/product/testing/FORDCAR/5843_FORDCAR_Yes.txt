            This car has been one of the best cars I have ever owned. I got the car when it had 60,000 mi. That was back in 1995. The car now has over 204,000 mi, and runs great. The only problem has been the transmission, it is starting to slip on me. Which could you blame it, the filter and fluid has never been changed.

The car has a very well laid out interrior. I have a L model and it is very well equiped for the cheapest you can get. The car has a 3.0L V6 engine automatic transmission, cloth split bench seat, power windows, power doorlocks, tape player, and it has 4 wheel disk brakes.

Since we have had the car all we had to do was change the water pump, brake pads and rotors, struts, and radiator.
We need to replace the rack&pinion stering, its getting lose because of so many miles. But, other than all this the car has been a very good car rain, snow or shine. This is one car I'm pleased to own and will own another.
