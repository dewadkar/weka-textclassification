            I bought this vehicle in 1998 with 9000 miles on it. It was a replacement for my 1991 S10 which was more expensive when I bought it than the Ranger was 7 1/2 years later. My Ranger is a 4 cylinder with an automatic transmission and air. I have had no problems except the dome light that might stay on after you closed the door and it might go off. I took it to Ford, and they fixed it. It worked fine for a while, but now it is the same thing, so I am just dealing with it since the warranty has expired. The gas mileage is decent, usually averaging 22 mpg in mixed driving. Heating and cooling systems are great. Basically this is a good, cheap to maintain, little work truck.<br><br>
