            Since my beloved 1989 Ford Escort went to car heaven two weeks ago, I've had the pleasure of driving my mom's Contour, and I love it. As it is a relatively inexpensive and conservative-looking car, I wasn't expecting it to drive as smoothly as it does, but I was pleasantly surprised. 
It gets excellent gas mileage (approximately 25 mpg in the city and 30 on the highway). It can stop on a dime, and turns and accelerates smoothly. (I tend to go faster than realize.) 
But there are a few drawbacks. Ford has recalled the 1998 Contour at least three times, for problems such as defective heater blower switches, front crash sensors and  brake pressure control reducing valves. 
However, I cannot emphasize enough how promptly Ford notifies Contour owners about the problems, and they have all been fixed quickly and at no cost to the owners. 
The only other thing that bothers me about the Contour is the manual locks. The rear door locks are difficult to reach, as you can only get to them from the front doors. 
They are also difficult to lock and unlock, because they tend to stick. 
All in all, this is a car I want to purchase myself in the near future.
