            I purchased my 1996 probe se in june of 2000 with 75,000 on the odometer. I was in the market for another vehicle and was immediately attracted to the probe. Its sleek, almost stealth like styling has always appealed to me.  Mine came equipped with a 5 spd. maunal transmission which still shifts as smooth and as ever.  The handling is very tight and leaves the driver feeling in complete control at all times.  The suspension could be a little tighter and lower profile, for I feel that this vehicle has a bit much fender gap for my taste.  Ride quality is surprisingly good.  It manages bumps, ruts and potholes very well, with little driver aggravation.  The powerplant is a 2.0L 118 Horsepower Mazda venture.  The 16V DOHC puts down 125 ft/lbs. of torque to the road which is rather high for a car of this caliber.  Being a college student, I can suggest this car for anyone who is looking for a sweet ride while being financially conscious at the same time. It offers amazing gas mileage (roughly $11 to fill the tank at $1.03 87 Octane) and I normally get 420-445 miles per tank granted that I leave my lead foot at home.  There is an ever expanding aftermarket available for the probe.  Everything from gauges to intakes, cat-backs, body-kits, manifolds, coil-overs and short throw shifters are available.  This car is a great platform for the sports compact enthusiast as well.  Being the owner of an 89' Probe with 243,356 miles on the unrebuilt 2.2L I chose o purchase another probe hoping that it will treat me as good as my other one, and so far...so good....
