            I am a former Ford salesman. So in other words, I have no reason to benefit from a sales pitch other than good karma. I believe that the Ford Expedition is one of the best vehicles on the market today. To be more specific the XLT trim level. There are so many standards that you would think the basic trim level was fully loaded. It is the most convienient vehical for different height drivers. A tall husband and a wife a foot or more shorter having difficulty adjusting to the same vehicle will have no more problems. The adjustable pedals(now standard) move 3 inches up or down. Helping a shorter person to not be sitting against the windshield. And for the Taller people, no knees forced up against the dashboard.
Thats just the beggining. Comfortably fits 7 adults. I don't have that many friends but perfect for family's or for space. The rear seats roll right out. You would be surprised on how light the bench seat is. The middle row seat folds down, leaving a flat open area to fit large items.
I loved selling the Expedition. So much to talk about, it sold itself really. All I had to do was get the keys and the rest spoke for itself.
Trim levels XL, XLT, Eddie Bauer(which I think has too many bells and Whistles)
