            I discovered my 1996 Ford Escort quite by accident.  After searching in vain for 5 weeks to replace my beloved Geo Metro, a kindly old used car salesman (believe it or not, a few still exist) recommended the Escort to me.  I made a quick dash for my trusty Consumer Reports used car guide and found that, to my surprise, the Escort holds up beautifully over the years.  The price was reasonable and it had just what I was looking for: a fuel-efficient 4-cylinder engine, A/C, a good heater plus a few little perks along the way.
I ultimately wanted a standard transmission but settled for the automatic due to the good deal I was offered.  

This is the car I wish I had had while going to college.

On the outside, let's face it, the 96 Escort is�well...ugly.  But I didn't buy it to impress the ladies I bought it to get my butt from point A to point B without a lot of maintenance.
The Escort is solid, reliable transportation.  You don�t have to go far to find a dealer for parts and most any repair shop can work on it, though I�ve never had to take it in for any repairs since I bought it last February. 

The stock AM/FM Cassette stereo sounds surprisingly good, negating the need to replace it any time soon.  It handles just fine and due to its 1.9L engine (most come with a 1.8) it goes up hills without any extra effort.  It drives well in the snow and the heater is warm enough cook muffins with.  Good gas mileage too.

The only two downsides to the car are the James Bond villain auto-glide seat belts (scary) and the somewhat stiff front seats.  Other than that, if you get a fair book price you will be glad you purchased this homely little performer.
