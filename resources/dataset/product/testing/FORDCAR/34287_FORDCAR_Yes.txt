            Buying this truck for my husband was a dream he has had for a long time. WE had been married 17 years at the time of the purchase and in that time he looked at many trucks. The week we bought the truck we had gone to all the different dealers in our area,we test drove a few. We settled on the 98 F-150 because it had the best ride and options that came with it. It is a Dark Green 3 door and is loaded. The only thing he would like that it didn't have was the radio/cd player that is in my 99 Windstar. This truck gets great gas mileage and rides like a caddy. It is easy to drive and handle and I have wowed many a driver when I back it into a parking place or parking in small areas .My father-in-law has a Chevy pickup and comments alot about how well our truck rides. I was involved in a major accident about 17 years ago and have to have a comfortable seat and ride to be able to sit for long periods of time, these seats are comfortable and would be perfect for a long road trip if it were just us. There is enough leg room for my 3 daughters for around town but would be close for longer trips. My daughters are 16,14, and 10 and they also love the truck.<br><br>
