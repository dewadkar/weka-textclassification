            I owned a 1983 Ford Bronco and getting rid of it has got to be one of the biggest mistakes of my life. The truck had a 351 Windsor in it providing all the power I ever needed. I could haul the boat to the lake, pull a horse trailer with two horses, climb a rocky hill each day to get to my home, and NEVER got stuck in the muddy roads of north central oklahoma. Infact, I could pull cars off the side of the road during winter. I had a nice Ramsey Winch on the front. I had mine lifted up and had 36 inch Mickey-T's on it. I also had 5 KC lights on top and two on the front. I enjoyed having a 4 barrel Carb because everything was manuel and could easily be worked on. The newer fuel injectors are only for the highly trained. I like a vehicle where you can step on the gas and the vehicle will go. I don't want a computer to decide if I should be going or not. This vehicle gave me plenty of control and lots of power every time. The only thing that ever went bad was eventually the exhaust pipes rusted out. I pulled the out and took them to a local shop and had them replaced with True Duals. The results were incredible. I even gained two miles per gallon to get an wonderful 17 MPG. If you ever get your hands on am '83 Bronco in good condition, especially if it has a good A/C, keep it because you'll never find a new vehicle as good as that one.
