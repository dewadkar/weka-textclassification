   I bought this vehicle because of looks, performance, and ride quality.
This car handles better than any other Ford vehicle to date (althought the car is 75% Mazda, which Ford owns anyways) ...of which it, and it's brother the Mazda MX6, has won stock Autocross competitions 2 years in a row, and ran in the top 3 for any other year in 93+  I love this car, and wouldn't trade it for the world...it DOES have it's share of setbacks, such as the seized caliper in the back, or the clogged (now clean) hydraulic lifters which are very sensitive to dirty engine oil...***HOWEVER if you have learned about the proper preventive maintenance on this car, looked up information on it, talked to fellow Probe owners about experiences they've had, and maintainted the car in a reasonable manner, this car will NOT give you any major expensive problems***

Minor performance setbacks are the mediocre stock &quot;Gatorback&quot; Goodyear tires...a good set of Dunlops or Nittos will help tremendously in all aspects, and wheel hop on quick takeoffs is bad until you can maintain a good way of launch. The stock intake &quot;mailbox slot&quot; is very restrictive, so if you're into performance modding...the intake is the first thing to modify, and then a Borla/GReddy exaust (costing $350, and $600 respectively, though perfromance in the GReddy isn't much better). If you like to modify vehicles, this engine is somewhat difficult to modify cheaply...HOWEVER....if you put a turbo on the GT 2.5 engine, it will reward you greatly. Wave to the Mustangs in your rearview mirror. It also responds well to Nitrous Oxide applications, and the 2.5 V6 has a very strong bottom end and is a particularily understressed and well-balanced engine. It can safely take as much as an 80hp shot. 

Driving the Probe is very easy, the engine is responsive and peppy...though this car is best left to the 5-speed. The Auto-tranny does not take advantage of the engine performance and VRIS intake system. The 5 speed shifts smoothly and accurately, and is one of the easiest manual transmissions you will ever encounter...my only minor complaint is the length of the throw, but it's not that long =) 

The engine is a 60 degree 2.5Liter Twin-Cam V6 with a Variable Resonance Intake System (VRIS)...the car turns out 164hp and 160ft-lbs of torque, appx. The torque line is dramatically smoothed out by the comlex intake system, and the horsepower is bumped up....this car just keeps building up until 6,000rpm =) Which with a well-rounded lengthy powerband, gives it a lot of advantage in drag-racing, rally-racing, autocrossing especially, difficult driving conditions, stop and go, avoiding traffic/construction, rush hour traffic, etc. 

I am reviewing the V6 GT model, I have no experience with the SE/base models or the pre-93 GT/GL/LX Turbo 4-cylinder/Vulcan V6

If you have no idea of how to perform maintenance on a car, or are the type of person that forgets to put gas in the car, let alone change the oil, this is not the car for you. I am a 19 year old college student, I have a white 94 GT 5-speed with all options except spoiler (unnecessary rear downforce on a front wheel drive car)

www.eGroups.com has a Probes forum called &quot;fineprobes&quot;...join it or post a message, if you have any questions regarding any year make or model Probe, or are looking into getting one, etc.  They are very helpful, and thee are people in there that represent organizations and clubs such as NPON (National Probe Owners Club), MiPOC (which I am a part of, Michigan Probe Owners Club), the largest &quot;POCs&quot;; BPOC &amp; SCPOC (Bay-Area Probe Owners Club &amp; Southern California Probe Owners Club).
