              We had gotten our 03 Focus Wagon ZTW in April and were very pleased with the handling and the comfort level of the seats and the room. I really loved the car until I started reading some of the comments of other owners online. It concerned me that many owners hated the car and had many problems with it. I soon learned that a lot of the folks who complain online don&#146t even own the car. So I put the car to the test, a 2500 mile road trip through South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana and Colorado. This was some the most rugged mountain areas of the lower 48. We went from 80 to 20 degrees on a daily bases and had to climb mountains that went above 11,000 feet. We took dirt roads, mud roads and snow covered roads and the car&#133&#133What a great car!! The car ran flawlessly not a single problem!! It was fun to be constantly passing other cars going up hill! I like this car. Before you buy make sure that you check the year and model. They are not all alike.
