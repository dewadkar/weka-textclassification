            I chose this vehicle because of it's history of being a traditional American car. This car has come to symbolize the essence of the American muscle car's and what American car's are about.  I think it would be a good idea for ford to bring back the good old 5.0 liter engine even though it guzzles gas like no other.  Supercharging the vehicle is also a major thing the should consider doing to the Mustang.  The mustang also needs to get rid of the 6 cylinder models because they are a disgrace to Mustangs.  I get the chill's when i see a mustang go by with one muffler.  Though it makes a lot of money for those who wish to tell other's how they drive a mustang, it is not a mustang with out the blaring dual exhaust from a monster v8.  Over all  the new look is moderatly good, a body kit would be nice for the front of the mustang which would give it more of an aero dynamic look. I think the going with the bigger wheels was another good decision by the guys at ford. The details is what makes this car so nice. Little things like the shape of the sides and the spolier. This car has potential.<br><br>
