            We all recall the older version of the Ford Escort, simply it was just a compact car, no frills, nothing remarkable in any way.  IF your in the market for a reasonably priced, even sporty not to compact sub compact then you need to check out the new escort line.  The first thing you must do is get the old image out of your head, completely out!  There is no comparison.  

The body of this new escort, I own the ford escort ZX2, reminds you a little of the former Probe line made also by Ford.  We bought it for my teenage daughter wanting to get her a safe vehicle to send her off to college in.  Fearing learning to drive a stick shift she bucked the idea at first until we convinced her she would have it mastered in no time and all her friends would be envious of her new ability and the guys would think it cool .  MY only regret before purchase was that I let her test drive it instead of me.  That little car has serious get up and ......GONE!  Seriously that car can move, it even makes me want to turn her loose on an open road , a feeling I haven't had in a car since I was her age.  

Aside from all the above its big enough to feel safe in if an accident were to happen, it comes with dual side air bags, plenty of leg room in front, a little less in back but hey... It handles excellently in curves , equipped with all the standard safety features and for the price you walk away feeling like Ford threw in a few goodies just to make you happy at no extra cost.  All in all its a very fun little car and with gas prices rising it remains affordable on the wallet.<br><br>
