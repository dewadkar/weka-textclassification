            We purchased our 99 Ford Econoline van in July of 1999.  Although it is excellent for just hauling kids around locally, it has proved to be irreplaceable for the LONG trips our family takes.  In August, we traveled over 1400 miles (one way) and with a 4 and 6 year old, we figured we would have some very road weary and bored children.  However, the van we purchased had a TV and VCR included in its package.  Believe it or not, we hardly had one &quot;I'm bored&quot; complaint the whole trip.  Also, with the back bench seat having the capability to fully recline, it served as a good bed for naps (not only kids, but mom and dad as well!).  While traveling, we even volunteered our van to haul most of the children because the TV worked wonders to keep them occupied while traveling between tourist stops.  
Other advantages include:  two lighter plugs instead of just one, more room between the front seats and the dash, magazine and map storage area, additional compartments between the front seats to hold phones, cords, etc., CD storage and player, and headphones and jacks for all seats in the back.  Gas mileage is also satisfactory (around 18 mpg on the highway).  The only drawback may be that the bucket seat by the side door does not allow a lot of room between it and the front bucket seat.  <br><br>
