            I bought my wagon used in 1994. It's a 1992. Low mileage and price is what first brought me to this car. Upon test driving it though, I really found that I liked it even better. It was a nice ride. I'm not one for mini van's or SUV's, so this was a good option for me. I've never had trouble fitting anything and everything in this wagon!. Put it this way, 2 adults, 1 child with car seat, luggage for 10 days, and 1 120lb dog all fit in this wagon! 

And the only problem that I have had is the fan that cool's the engine that should come on and off depending on temp, doesn't, and still cannot find anyone who can fix it. Though I have figured a way around it. 

I know that when this wagon need's to be replaced, no question in my mind, it will be another Escort Wagon!<br><br>
