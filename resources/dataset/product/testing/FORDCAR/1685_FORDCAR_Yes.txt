            Bought my Excursion XLT from North Carolina, Black Mountain to be exact. From the moment I saw this vehicle in NY I wanted one, and when 	 went to NC on a buisness trip I found one unbeleivably cheap compared to NY prices for this particular SUV. This is hands down the BIGGEST, BADEST SUV on the Market. I love the Interior space it has, the exterior is for lack of a better word Beautiful. Washing this SUV is a mission in itself, but ive got it down to 1 1/2 hrs with a shammy to dry it.Driving this SUV is like being on top of the world I love it! You see all in front of you, the trailer tow mirrors are a god send (way to go Ford) someone actualy thought about that one. Towing is a breeze up to 10,000 on a 5.4 V8, I mean if you are towing more you need a construction Bulldozer. The way people look at you and the expression on peoples faces when the first saw my new TANK was priceless. The only complaints you get are from suburban owners and Yukon owners complaining because they thought they had the biggest SUV , NOT anymore take a back seat to this baby!! I recently put the K &amp; N Generation FIPK in the vehicle to replace the stock air filter kit, what a diffrence in Power and gas pedal responce time, strongly recommended, I dont recommend this vehicle for women, unless they are used to driving vans or fullsize SUV's, I drove extended vans my whole life and took a little getting used to the width and lenth of this Monster. SUV owners test drive this baby and see what im talking about. 1 test drive will convince the stingiest enthusiast. overall I Strongly recommend this SUV to all that can handle it. The ONLY minus of this SUV is: GAS GAS GAS GAS GAS, but if you can afford to buy it, you can afford to fill it up! HAPPY CRUSHING!!!!<br><br>
