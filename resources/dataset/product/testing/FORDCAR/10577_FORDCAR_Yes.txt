            The 2000 Ranger Trailhead is a great looking pickup..4x4Look with 16&quot; wheels. Great package. we have only seen 1 other besides ours in th 4 months since we've owned it.. I really catches the looks at traffic  lights.. I am always being asked if it's 4 wheel drive? What model it is and How I decided on the trailhead. I have to say this called to me from across the dealers lot and I had to have it. I wonder why more of them aren't on the street?When speaking to our salesmen he advised that he only had two on the lot and both sold the first week..Mine is jet black and I've seen the red and copper color..I prefer Black..The truck rides as quiet as my 95 T-Bird and that rides beautifully...Bumps on the New Jersey roads are a pleasure in  my Tralhead..It has been great in the snow that we've had these last 2 weeks...    <br><br>
