            Want a fun and safe vehicle to drive or own/ Then this is your car! The explorer accelerates well, and is a blast to drive. However, the most impressive fact about the explorer in my mind is its safety. After i was rear ended at nearly 40mph, the frame held up well, and i was kept safe by the airbags. It was the most influential factor in my buying a new explorer. However the explorer has some downsides. It gets average gas mileage, and drives like a truck. The littlest pothole can result in a big jar for the passengers. The rear leg room is ok for kids to teens, but can be cramped if adults ride in the rear. I would strongly recommend this for a first car for a child, because of its safety and reliability, I have only returned once to the ford dealership in 2 years for a minor tune-up.  If you can stand the bumpy ride, get this exciting car <br><br>
