            Since 1966, I've always kept my eye on the Ford Mustang and I love it but Ford itself really has a lot to be left desired.  

If you have this thing about buying American cars, go for the Ford Mustang, but only the Mustang, all other Fords are very poorly made.  We had a 1992 Mercury Sable manufactured by Ford and every 6 months or so it needed to be worked on.  And so after about 2 or 3 years it just crapped out on us. But as for the Mustang, its a sweeeeet automobile.  If you have a chance to grab one, I say &quot;GO FOR IT.&quot;  

One more thing, if you have an option, get manual transmission.  It's the only way to go...<br><br>
