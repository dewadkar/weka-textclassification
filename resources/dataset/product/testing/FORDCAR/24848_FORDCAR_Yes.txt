            Why would a 27 year old mother of 5 need a 2000 Mustang?  Who cares!  Oh my gosh....what a sweet ride!

My husband and I recently sold our conversion van and were in the market for a well equipped, sporty, good gas mileage car.  (How could a Mustang possibly rank in that last quality?  Let me tell you!)

Initially our intent was to possibly purchase a Ford Escort ZX2.  It's a small car that gets great gas mileage--just what we needed.  While on the lot looking around (with my fingers crossed behind my back) I wandered over to the Mustangs just to take a peek.  The price was a little higher than the Escorts by about $3-4000 but low and behold the gas mileage was almost the same!  How can that be?  Don't the Mustangs have the big, souped-up engines that suck gas?  Not really.

By this time the vultures had landed, and of course were more than willing to sell a Mustang over an Escort, so off we go on a test drive.  This car handles so easily!  We opted for a manual transmission not only because of cost but also because it's a little easier to handle in inclement weather.  (Or so my dad says.)  

We chose a 6 cylinder manual transmission and kept everything pretty basic.  Not looking for the fancy leather seats or anything like that.  Since the exterior color was black the interior is a dark gray/black mix cloth.  While the seats aren't overly plush, they are comfortable.  We even drove the car to Davenport, Iowa (6 hours away) and had no problems being uncomfortable.  As a matter of fact we even slept in the darn thing at a road-side stop.  (Don't go there, I know those places are as unsafe as all get-out...trust me, hubby and I had "words."  There was plenty of leg room in the front and back seats plus ample space in the trunk.  My husband had room to lay the driver's seat back to sleep in and I crawled into the back seat and slept across it.  Not exactly Motel 6 per se, but it worked in a pinch.  No pun intended. 

The particular car that we chose was equipped with a CD player, the upgraded stereo speakers, smokers package (we don't smoke though), power windows, power locks and power seat adjustment on the driver's side.  Like I said, there's nothing fancy about this car, it's very simple and works for the purpose we intended.

We did choose to lease for 2 years and things have been going very well.  My husband drives the car when he goes to work and I drive it when I go to work.  The gas mileage has been excellent so far and we have no regrets getting the Mustang instead of the Escort.  If you're in the market for a car that looks good, gets great gas mileage and drives like a dream then you should definitely check it out!
