            When my sister graduated from high school, she got a Ford Mustang. It was blue, and it was FAST. When i graduated 10 years later, my parents got smart and gave me my moms 1995 Ford Escort. It has 4 doors and a 4 cyclinder engine. I must say I felt a little jipped on the deal. But I am happy they gave me the car, instead of making me buy one on my own. 

The car runs good. Even after having it 5 years, and putting it through the hell that teenagers do. I have put 75,000 miles on it. Replace 3 sets of tires, ( only because i forget to rotate them). I have also had to replace 3 batteries at this point. But i think thats more of the mechanics fault than the car. My car has a spoiler on the back, I guess my mom thought that added a bit of coolness to the car. HA!! 

Overall its a good car. I still have it. And now it carries my hubby, child and me. I am shopping for a new car. The car is nice when you dont have kids. There just isnt enough room for everything. So if you are single, or you are married with no kids,and want a cheap car, this one works well. <br><br>
