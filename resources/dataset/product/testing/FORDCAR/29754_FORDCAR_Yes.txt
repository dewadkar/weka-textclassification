            After I sold my previous car, a very nice 1994 Taurus SHO, I decided I needed something a little nicer.  My choices were either a Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury because my father owns a few car dealerships.  I went to an auction with him and picked out a great looking 97 Eddie Bauer Explorer.
  
First of all I love how high this vehicle rides, you can really see everything around you.  I noticed in my SHO that there were some blind spots, in my Explorer there are none.  
  
The interior of this vehicle is great.  There is loads of space.  When I moved to college in August I fit nearly everything I needed into the Explorer (with the seats folded down)! 
  
Ford always makes durable products.  The only thing that this vehicle needs is regular servicing.  I never took this vehicle in to get repairs.   

Pulling two jet-skis is quite a easy with the Eddie Bauer Explorer due to the 5.0 V8.  It's quite an engine.  My only dispute with the power is that it goes to all four wheels instead of just two because of All Wheel Drive.  This vehicle could be quite the speedster!

Control is great because of the all wheel drive and ABS so it's a great vehicle for winters.  I never felt like I was out of control this past winter. 
  
My major complaint with this vehicle is the gas mileage.  I mostly drove in town and my bill was so much more than when I drove my Taurus.  I estimate that it was twice as much.  The control center in the vehicle read around 14 mpg in town.  

Another thing that I didn't like was the average handling.  The center of gravity was high on this vehicle and I could notice it on SHARP corners.  I felt quite safe though on curvy highways.
  
Overall this vehicle is a great buy.  It has great power, room, and durability with the only real problem being gas mileage.<br><br>
