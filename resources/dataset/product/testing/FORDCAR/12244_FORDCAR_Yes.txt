            I drive a 1994 XLT Ford Ranger 4x2.  It is a 5 speed 4 banger (4 cyl) and the top of the stereo.  I enjoy driving this truck and it has been driven a lot.  I got it July 1998 with 45,000 miles and the odometer just turned over to 70,000. I usually gets 26 to 30 mpg on highway. I just got the clutch adjusted and the tranny worked on at 65,000.  All aspects on the truck are good except their is a large gap between third and fourth gears which only means that you need to say in third a little longer than the others.  The other thing is the lack of weight on the back which means for the 4x2 trucks traction is not good but you can just put a sandbag or something heavy to fix that.  Over all this is a great truck, not gobs of power, but just a versitale small run around.<br><br>
