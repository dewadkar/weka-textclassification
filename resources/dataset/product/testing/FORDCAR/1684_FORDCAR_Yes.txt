            Its me again! i`m back from a very long absense and i was browsing through epinions and i see they have the excursion for review, well i jumped to the opurtunity of course. This SUV (more like a rolling mountain) is the biggest SUV that Ford has to offer.....and they didn`t pull out any stops what so ever! First this vehicle shares the platfrom of the award winning and best selling F-SERIES (if u need strength then thats what u need!!) and Ford also has wonderful options for this new super heavyweight of an SUV. options are as follows: the payload on this suv is roughly 1,744 to roughly 1,990lbs. and your engine options are the 5.4L and the 6.8L and also you have the option of getting this SUV with the very powerful POWERSTROKE 7.3L power plant. And the towing capacity is VERY remarkable, it ranges from 6,200lbs to roughly 10,000lbs.!! But my opinion on the price, which fully loaded is about $40,605 and if you have money thats burning a hole in your pocket then this heavyweight SUV is the one for you!  WATCH OUT CHEVY! The suburban has a new enemy!<br><br>
