            We bought one of these to replace our aging Chrysler minivan.  At first I was skeptical, being a fan of the Chrysler and having heard bad things about Ford for a long time, but the price was right for what we wanted.  In the three years since purchasing our Windstar, it has proved to be an admirable vehicle.  We have encountered very few problems, save for a bad wheel coupling and some power problems, along with the expected wear and tear.  In fact, it has stood up to wear surprisingly well, despite the fact that we've used it to carry all sorts of stuff all over the Southwest.  The V6 delivers power when necessary and is great for towing our small camper.  The cargo area is spacious and the seats are easy to remove for bigger loads.  The rear seat layout could be improved, allowing more leg room.  More drink holders would also be nice.  Maintenance is fairly inexpensive and it is cheap to drive for a minivan.  The handling is admirable, as it drives like a car unlike Ford's previous offering--the Aerostar.  All in all, a very good vehicle and a great buy<br><br>
