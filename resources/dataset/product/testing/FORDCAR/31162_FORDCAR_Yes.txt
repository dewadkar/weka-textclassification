            I thought I would give my opinion on this vehicle. I bought it as a leased car in 2000 with 20,000 miles. I decided to go with the 3.8L V6 non-GT model, as the insurance on the GT was prohibitive, and I wanted better gas mileage (Mine gets 21-23mpg in general). I looked at other cars, but really wanted a Mustang, so I purchased this one at a dealership with the remainder of the 36,000 mile factory warranty for $11,500. 

I have nothing but good things to say about this car, and I have driven SUV's, mini-vans, luxury cars and pick-up trucks. If you need the space to seat 4 people, or have children, this car isn't the way to go, as the back seat is very, very small with no legroom. My husband, at 6'4" can drive the car, and likes too, though he is a bit cramped in the drivers seat. If the car was an automatic though, it might be easier, his leg mobility for using the clutch is limited by the door panel. Though I, at 5'9", fit perfectly into this car like it was made just for me. And, it has LOTS of trunk space. 

The controls for the radio, a/c, heat, and driver's features are easily accessible and very convenient to use while driving. One caveat though, the cup holders, especially in the manual model, are totally useless. Ok, very poor planning there. No matter which holder you put the cup in it either spills or makes it impossible to shift. This has resulted in a number of spills in the front seats. Other than that I really enjoy driving the car. The seats are very comfortable, and this is coming from someone who drives for 6 or 7 hours at a stretch frequently. The quality of the interior is also good. The carpet shows little wear, and the dash plastic hasn't faded at all, though the seats stain fairly easily and I would recommend seat covers sooner rather than later.

The exterior of the car is very flashy and sporty, and I never cease to get compliments on my car, even in dark hunter green, it really sparkles. There are plenty of accessory kits and decals available for the car, but I think the spoiler, alloy wheels, and tinted windows are plenty, looking classy, not cheap.

The car drives great, and has plenty of pick-up. It has beat many a vehicle off the stop line, even with all factory parts and no modifications. It glides along on the highway effortlessly, though I do have to watch my speed... As far as reliability, at 70,000 miles I still haven't put much into the car. The brakes/rotors did need to be replaced at 60,000 miles, and the O2 sensor in the engine needed replacing also. Those two repairs are the only ones my car has needed so far, other than that the regular oil changes seem to be sufficient. It has never failed to start, even when we returned from a 2 week vacation it started right up. 

If you are considering a Mustang I highly recommend them, and it is going to be very hard to part with my car, but with our first baby on the way we need to upgrade to a larger vehicle. I'm not sure how I'll adapt going from sports car to mini-van, but if you don't need the extra space, and only need to seat one or two passengers regularly, I would say go for it!
