            Renting this Ford Escort ZX2 has been a real eye opener.  My father swears by Ford, but all I've ever heard is:  FORD (Fix Or Repair Daily).  But, that was yesterday.  Today I rented a Ford and it has been a fantastic experience.  How can I explain just how cute it is.  The air conditioner and radio are positioned just right.  Just lean forward and everything is at your fingertips.  Two police officers pulled up to the car and admired how good it looks.  They couldn't believe it is an Escort.  O.K., you got the point -- I look good in this car!

Zippy Doo Dah!  This car truly has speed.  It handles corners, hills and traffic lights very well.  It looks sporty, because it is sporty.  Although this rental has 58,000 miles on it, cruising down the road is like a dream.  And, Let's talk about saving money.  I've been driving around all day and I haven't used 1/4 tank of gas as yet.

When you are broke or depressed, this is the car you want to be sitting in.
