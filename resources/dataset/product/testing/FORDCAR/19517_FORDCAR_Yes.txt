            Since 1964, the Ford Mustang has played a major role of an American tradition.  In the past, the Mustang has been known as �boss,� �cobra,� and �Mach I.�  It won the hearts of American teenagers during the late �60s.  Now, the 2001 Mustang GT is mightier than ever!  Equipped with a mighty 4.6 SOHC V8 engine (260 horsepower and 302 ft. lbs. of torque) it�s a great buy for $25,000.

The Pros 

Because the Mustang is a domestic car, any other vehicle with an equivalent of Mustang GT�s engine would cost $30,000 to $40,000.  In Europe and Asia, the Mustang cost $40,000 to $60,000!  There is a high demand for this car and people in other countries dream of driving an American made Mustang.

In the heart of the Mustang GT lies a mighty engine.  A 4.6 L SOHC V8 engine give the car a whopping 260 horsepower with 302 ft. lbs. of torque.  To give you an idea, Honda�s V6 Accord coupe has 200 horsepower.  Honda�s EX Civic has 127 horsepower.  The Acura Integra, Type R, has 195 horsepower, and Toyota Celica�s GT-S has 180 horsepower.  With 260 horsepower, your teeth will clench and you will have to slow down before you know it.  In fact, you will reach 0-60 in less than 6 seconds!

Some cars would sacrifice space for power.  No need to worry.  The Mustang is comfortable as driving the Accord coupe.  The premium package equipped in Mustang GTs, is great.  17&quot; 5-spoke premium alloy wheels gives the Mustang GT a racing look.  Leather seats, in the GTs, is a great feel.  Even the steering wheel is leather wrapped to give you a great fun feel.  What is noticeable is Mustang GT�s MACH 460 sound system.  Equipped with AM/FM cassette and 6-disc in dash CD changer, the sound system has great balance with bass and treble.

The Mustang is not only well equipped, inside, it is equipped with many surprises that will make heads turn.  Dual stainless steel exhaust is a plus that makes the Accord V6 coupe�s exhaust look puny in size.  The rear bumper has �Mustang� stamped on.  This gives the car a unique look because most other cars has a bumper that is simply mediocre.

The Cons

Although Mustang has four seats, two adults would feel cramped sitting at the back.  Because Mustang is a sports car this is a typical problem that Mitsubishi Eclipse, Toyota Celica GT, and Acura Integra also faces.  Teenagers would have to sit back all the way to accompany head room.  However, children will probably feel comfortable sitting at the back.  The spoiler is rather small and mediocre.  Integra�s �Type R� has a huge spoiler that is three times taller than the Mustang�s spoiler.  Some drivers would solve this problem by going to a custom shop and upgrading to a more sporty spoiler for $200-$300.

Although American cars have a lot of torque and engine power, they are bombarded by the old myth that American cars would break down in a few years.  My mom owned a 1980 Thunderbird  and it broke down 3 years later.  The warranty did not cover the air conditioning.  As a result, my mom never bought American cars.  American cars today are better than ever.  While this is true, the Mustang is better built today than ten years ago.

Recommended for 

Teenagers.  Teenagers will love ramming up the engine.  At high RPM, this car would sound like a small drag racer.  For $25,000 there is no car with a larger engine.  Most teenagers will be satisfied with the hard top.  The convertible is great but drivers should consider wind chill factors and the number of �bad hair days� they will have for every drive they make.

Not Recommended for

Adults who have large families.  Although the Accord coupe has plenty of room at the back, the Mustang does not.  The engine would be too loud for some drivers.  Drivers who are looking for quiet luxurious sports cars, should consider the Accord coupe, instead.

If you have enough money for an Accord coupe or an Integra GS-R, I would suggest that you test drive the Mustang Gt.  Keep in mind that the regular Mustang has a V-6 engine with 190 horsepower and 220 ft. lbs. of torque.  Decide if you want hard top or convertible.  Then decide if you want �standard,� �deluxe,� or the �premium� package.  To help you out I have copied the following information from the 2001 Mustang catalog.  Happy car shopping!
