            The Eddie Bauer Edition of the '98-'99 Series Ford EXPEDITION is a top-performing product in a multitude of ways.

First and foremost, mechanical assembly is very sound, and all parts and systems have performed with regular recommended maintenance to this point---44,000+ miles---without ANY SERIOUS problems. 

There have been NO transmission pick-up problems, drive-train issues, or failures of the differing drive option shifts. Vehicle handles with solid quality consistency in all types of terrain and weather. Handbook is fairly comprehensive, and could use some minor re-work.

The electronics have performed flawlessly.

The upholstery and features are well assembled.

In future editions, Ford is highly advised to make the following improvements:

Some LOGICAL and COHERENT explanation of the drive change capabilities and choices.


Defrostable mirrors(electronically)

Heated seat option.

Better positioning of the rear seat sound controls( kids easily kick the station and control settings from where they sit...a major annoyance for a good product idea!)

Better handles on the back seat levers. They are of poor quality, and seat movement has been a problem from time to time.

The major flaw is extremely poor rubber insulation, as this is the only car that I have owned that has had major and frequent door freeze-ups in -32(F) weather conditions. This is a somewhat serious matter. Lock performance in -32(F) weather has been fair to mediocre.

This is the top of the ride line of SUVs.<br><br>
