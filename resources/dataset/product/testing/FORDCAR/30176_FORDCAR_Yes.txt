            Coming from a family that owns two 2002 Escapes and having put nearly 10,000 miles on the cars since last March I have been very satisfied by my choice of a car for the last nine months.  I keep one of the Escapes in Vail, Colorado to use when I am out there in the winter and summer.  The other Escape is kept at home in Minneapolis for when it snows and I cannot use my 2-wheel drive car.  As you can see both of these cars were purchased for use in very snowy environments, yet also work perfectly well when I had an Escape with me in dry San Francisco for 6 months.

The exterior:
	Most noticeably I am simply a fan of the exterior styling of the escape.  Compared to other small SUVs on the market I enjoy the look of my car.  The main reason I bought this car was that I wanted a small truck for snowy environments.  With the escape I can get the height of any other SUV, but the dimensions of a normal car.  Parking the escape in a parking lot and driving through busy cities (I have taken the car in downtown Minneapolis and San Francisco numerous times) is no more difficult then when I drive my sister&#146s small Volvo S40.  When I am driving in busy ski resorts and the majority of people are driving Suburban I don&#146t feel intimidated by them in my escape.
	The escape also comes with a number of exterior accessories, I have a 6 pair ski rack on my roof as well as a rack for 2 bikes coming out of the trailer hitch.  There are many more accessories available for any of your needs.

Interior:
	I choose to get both of my Escapes with leather seats.  The seats are comfortable enough; I do regular 100  mile journeys in my Escape and very rarely get uncomfortable.  The back seats could use a little more legroom, but compared to other small cars available there is little to complain about in terms of sitting room in the escape.  Being 6&#146 2&#148 headroom has always been a large issue for me; in the escape I have room to spare between the roof and me.  Any six footers out there would have no issues with the escape.  The escape has good cargo space in the back, it&#146s no suburban, yet equal to or better then the average 4 door car.
	My cars have automatic transmission, AC/Heat, electric seats and windows, and the 6 disks CD changer (alternatively you can get 1 CD with a tape player or 6 CD and no tape). The stereo is not spectacular, yet during all of my journeys I had no complaints to what I was hearing.  This year Ford started making a &#147limited&#148 escape, this comes with heated seats and mirrors as well as a parallel parking assistor that beeps as you back up telling you how far you have till the car behind you.  There is also a massive storage container in the armrest between the driver and passenger, plus ample cup holders for all occupants of the vehicle. The glove box is big enough, and everything in the car is simple and easy to use.  While the interior isn&#146t what you will find in luxury cars, changing from my parents Audi/Mercedes into my Escape is not a painful process.

Handling:
	Both of my Escapes come with the V6 engine opposed to the 4-liter model.  Not a rocket, but will move decently.  Driving in the mountains at high altitudes there are times I wish the car had a few more horses, but you could always do much worse then what the escape has.  Most of my time driving the escape is on highways, the car offers great visibility of the road and is easy to handle.  For an SUV the car gets decent gas mileage, 15-20 mpg depending on your conditions. The escape comes with 4x4 for when you need better traction, it&#146s no Audi Quattro, but very respectable.  One thing the escape doesn&#146t hide is that it is a truck.  While it isn&#146t a massively boxy car to drive, the escape will never be able to trick people into thinking they are driving a usual car.  My biggest complaint about the escape is the wind noise as you drive.  At high speeds there is a ton of whistling from the air coming in anywhere the car is not completely air tight.  Annoying, but you can just turn the music up and the problem sort of goes away.

All in all I have been very satisfied with the Escape.  The power is good enough, handles very well and is easy to maneuver.  The interior, with all the options, is very nice and an overall good experience to drive in.  For just over $25,000 the escape is a great little car.
