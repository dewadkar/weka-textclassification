            I've gone through many SUV's in the past years. I've owned 5 and driven about anything on the market, anything that will go off-road that is.  This is the only vehicle I have come across that will tow 6k-7k lbs, is real comfortable, and has the ground clearance to do it off road.  I've pulled 6000lb generators in places you couldn't get most SUVs, this truck actually raises up when put in 4wd, and then it raises up again when put in 4WD LOW. Self leveling suspension and room for 4 guys and lots of gear, a fantastic sound system.... lots of extras.
My vehicle has 9000 miles on it, it's 4 months old. The only thing I would compare this to is the older version full size Monteros with diesels (never sold in this country).  The would run through 2ft water and pull 5k lbs no problem.  I used them all over Africa and S. America.  
Ford has come up with a good vehicle, and it's now been on the market for several years.  I think it's mechanically sound and I'm confident that the local Ford dealer has the know how to fix any problems.  I definitely recommend this vehicle. Whether to take the kids to the mall, which I do too, or take off road....this is the best SUV on the market period.
