            Our ` 99 Taurus SE, automatic, with spoiler (would not get if have choice).  Our second Taurus, first was a `98 SE which gave no problems whatever for about 100,000 km (62000 mi.).  The `99 was leased by a sales manager for his wife who wanted a van and would not drive the Taurus;  we bought it March 2002 with 18000 km (11200 mi.) - looked brand new - along with extended warranty for $850 Cdn. as the 3 yr. warranty had expired.  Same feeling as with the `98, i.e. very good car for long trips and fuel efficient.  However, at 25000 km (15500 mi.), first Service Engine Soon (SES)came on - cause: speed sensor in the transmission (not covered by ext. warr. - surprise, surprise) - Ford l(after some haggling) paid half.  On trip, about 1500 mi. from home,2nd SES:  vacuum sensor on the Exhaust Gas Recirculator and running light module were replaced, $484 Cdn. (again not covered by ext. warr., but  Ford again paid half).  I am now wondering about the OBDII stuff on newer cars and what would happen if the SES light flashes (meaning shut off engine) a long way from any help.  Still, I like the Taurus; it's useful (can get 8 ft. boards in the car, etc.).  I just wish Ford would continue making it, but just improve it.  Would I it recommend anyone (family person, single, whatever), for sure.  My email: ardate@sympatico.ca for anyone wanting to discuss the SES stuff and Taurus' further.  One last thing:  On some vehicles, the trunk hinges are somewhat toward the center; on the Taurus, these are on the sides - much, much better.
