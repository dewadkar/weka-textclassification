            I purchased a 1997 Ford Probe GL brand new in April of 1997. It only had 10 miles on it and initially, I bought it because it was sporty, good on gas and had all of the driving characteristics a young enthusiast like me was looking for. 
To this day, I still love the car and feel the sheer fun of it when it was new. However, being a mechanic, I have noticed the car is not without it's faults...
Since day one, the transmission has never shifted right, and every time it was scoped, it had no problems. It never downshifted to second gear around a corner, and apparently, this is normal. Not only that, but the tranny fluid was burned bad by 20,000 miles. I changed it, but now it has 29,000 miles and is burned again to much the same extent. I've been told the CD4E transmissions are prone to this.
Aside from that, I've had no problems that fell under the warranty period. Now it is under the &quot;extended service plan&quot;, and I have learned never to purchase this again. The oxygen sensor went out at 28,000 miles, a month after my main warranty expired. Ford won't cover this under the extended plan, along with a mass air flow sensor. Both are very spendy parts and each alone cost over $300 to repair. 
The ride quality and drive feel are both excellent, and any person who loves to drive should not count this car out in any considerations. It is fast, even with the four cylinder automatic, and very sporty. Granted, it isn't for the family, but what two-door car is? The front seats are very comfortable, and all the controls are within easy reach. Makes for less distractions in the drive.
Overall, I guess it averages out to just another car. The great driving is a modest offset to the repair costs. But if you are looking for a good used car (being as they're no longer in production)with a positive feel for the road and a price to fit any budget, the Probe is the car. Personally, for me it wasn't, and I traded mine in on a new Cavalier Z24...
