            I know, I know...The Expedition is HUGE.  It's hard for other drivers to see around, and the gas mileage isn't so great.  But, you know what?  I love it anyway. 

 I have four small children, and I feel that we are really safe in this vehicle.  I am a small woman, but I handle this truck just fine.  It rides like a car.  It took some time getting used to &quot;hoisting&quot; myself up into the seat, but I sure like the feeling of power it gives me over those itty-bitty VW Bugs on the street!

The only complaint I have, is that it is difficult to get into and out of the 3rd bench.  You have to climb over the 2nd bench for access.  This is a major bummer with kids and muddy shoes.  I was also disappointed that the Expedition does not come with the option for a built-in car-seat.  That makes no sense whatsoever, since the Explorer has that option.<br><br>
