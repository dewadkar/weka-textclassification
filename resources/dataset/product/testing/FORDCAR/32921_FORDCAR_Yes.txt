            My wife &amp; I bought a new 2000 Ford Ranger about a month ago. It is 4L v6,automatic overdrive transmission, 4wheel drive, extended cab 4 door. I have always liked Chevy, but my wife loves Ford so I agreed to look..

We found a very good deal on this truck and I was sold. I like it much better than the Dodge Dakota and Chevy trucks that we tried out. This truck came with about every option except class3 hitch. I love the cd/cassette player. The 4 doors make it  very convenient to access the rear-seat area to get groceries in and out.  We haven't had to use the fold-down rear seats, but I don't think that they would be comfortable for an adult for any distance; but usually my wife &amp; I are the only ones using the truck. I drive 50-60 miles a day, and the truck has done great. We have taken several trips and I have no complaints at all, except that a little more power would be nice. Since we are in WV, there are a lot of hills, and even though the truck has handled them fine at 60-70mph, I haven't tried towing anything yet. 
We are planning on getting a pull camper, about 25ft, which would weigh about 4200#. We'll have to see how the truck handles it.
PS- My wife says the Ford rides better than the other trucks.<br><br>
