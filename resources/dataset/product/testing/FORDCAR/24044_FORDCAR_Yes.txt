            The Ford Expedition that I leased was an extremely comfortable and fun
big vehicle to drive. Sitting up high is an advantage for visual awareness of traffic ahead and to both sides. The XLT with the small V8
engine was powerful enough to pull a 16' boat/trailer and a 5' X 10'
trailer with various loads. The lease price was very affordable and I
was tempted to buy it at the termination. The only thing I absolutely hated about the vehicle was the difficulty in changing a tire. The bottle
jack was not only &quot;weak&quot; but didn't travel high enough to raise the vehicle to put on the spare. And with a minimum base on the jack, it tilted and the vehicle came falling down, narrowly missing me. I eventually had to have AAA come and change the tire for me. A woman absolutely could not change a tire on this vehicle, if her life depended on it.<br><br>
