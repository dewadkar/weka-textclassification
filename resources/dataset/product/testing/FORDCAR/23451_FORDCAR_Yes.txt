            The Ford Taurus adapted a stunning shape in 96. I think it is nice but also like the older models. The GL holds a 3.0 liter v-6. Standard in LX is a 3.o liter Duratec v-6 with dual camshafts and 200 horsepower. Both use a 4 speed automatic transmission, but the LX has electonic controls.

Dual airbags are present and anti-lock brakes are optional. Six passenger models have nifty arm rests that make into cup holders. It's quiet but you have to floor it for quick passing. In the LX the trans shifts smooth but hesitates before down shifting.The 3.0 v6 is more noisy and slower.

 Steering is right on. Both models hug corners. Not sure about suspension. It seems bumpy and somewhat stiff. If you are considering this for family use go with a four door. This is a pretty decent car. It is dependable but no good in snow.<br><br>
