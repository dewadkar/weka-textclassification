            Please know I am not a Ford fan, however, I am a regular renter from Hertz - thus I drive LOTS of Fords. In the past two years, my favorite car to rent is a ford contour. This is a smaller version of a Taurus and it seems to have all the luxury features of a Taurus, except the wheel base and interior is slightly smaller.
It is excellent on mileage and seems to get around 23-25 mpg. The space for the driver is as good as the Taurus. The ones I have rented have all power seats and windows, so they all seem the same.
But, the space in the trunk far outweighs many other rentals I have had. IT handles very well and seems to have a pretty tight steering configuration. I find them almost fun to drive.
There is a good ability to see throughout the entire vehicle and there appears to be no blind spots. Also, there are the usual methods of safety built in - such as putting your foot on the break before you can release the shift out of park into another gear.
The arm rest is better than that awful Taurus nonsense of picking the entire deal up and pulling out this huge drink holder that is the armrest upside down.
The backseat did not look terribly big in terms of leg room, but then, how often do we have adults in our cars these days?
These are good solidly built cars.  I feel very safe in this vehicle, for some reason that I cannot put to words.  I feel like this car may even be safer than the Taurus, which I had a very serious accident in, in 1995 and the airbags saved my life and my ability to walk.
Perhaps, because it is so contoured to your body and the design on the interior is excellent.  The seats are comfortable and you can ride in one of these for a long period without getting antsy or cramped up.
In all, if I were in the secondary market for a new car and saw one of these little babies on a lot, I would scoop it up in a heartbeat!<br><br>
