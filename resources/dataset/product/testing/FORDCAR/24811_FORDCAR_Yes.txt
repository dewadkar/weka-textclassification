            I recently purchased a silver 2000 Ford Mustang.  This was the third Mustang in a row that I purchased.  The reason I keep buying Mustang's are due to the fact that the price is very reasonable and I found the 

Ford dealerships to be very accomodating.  Out of the three Mustang's that I have owned (1995/1998/2000) I find that the 2000 model is by far the best one.  I love the ride, acceleration, and new body style.  It is 

a pure pleasure to get into my Mustang each day.  The only thing that I dislike about the car is the fact that my two dogs (Boxers) don't fit to well in the back seats.  I know I should have purchased a sports utility 

but I'm not ready to change cars yet.  I think that every young person should purchase this car.  It's fun, flashy, and you feel really cool driving it.  Most people don't look into the Mustang's due to the fact 

that they think the sticker price is too high.  I used the internet to get all the info about the car I was looking into.  It was extremely painless purchasing the car.<br><br>
