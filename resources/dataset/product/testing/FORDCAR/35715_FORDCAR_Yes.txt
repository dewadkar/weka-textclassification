I bought this car on a summer day, I was driving to work, looked over and saw it sitting on the dealer's lot. Emerald green, white top shinning in the sun, I fell in love. I pulled in (in a 1989 Camaro). Looked it over, took it for a drive, bought it that day. It is also one of the &quot;Limited Edition&quot; Mustangs Ford put out for the 25th anniversary, I've found several different opinions on this edition of the car.

GENERAL EXPERIENCE:

So far I have been very happy with the car, it had 12,000 miles on in when I bought it 4 years ago, 83,000 currently. The only real fault I find with the car is that it seems to go through batteries very quickly, about one every 2 years. And the top will leak occasionally in a heavy rain, only once in the last year, and that was only a few drops at that. Besides the batteries being replaced every 2 years, I really haven't had manmy problems with it, I recently replaced the fuel pump regulator. But other than that I haven't had any expenses with it, except for the normal maintenance items. But the tires can be expensive, from about $400 for decent tires, up to $1000 or so for high perfomance Z rated. I don't really find any difference between the regular and premium gasoline. 

There are some things that do have to be dealt with owning this car, driving in the rain requires extra care, as the slightest throttle at any speed below 25-30 mph can result in a spin or 6, and forget about driving in the snow. I have to wait till the day after the roads are plowed before I can make up any incline, even a driveway. But these are things that are to be expected with such a car. The snow was the hardest to learn to deal with, moved to New York from Florida. 

FUEL MILEAGE:

The fuel mileage is decent for having a 5.0 liter V-8, I get 16-18 with normal driving, and between 20-28 on the highway, depending on the speed. 60-70 gets between 22-25, drops quickly above 70. My brother's Pathfinder get worse mileage than I do.

COMFORT:

I've read that some people seem to find the seats hard and uncomfortable on longer trips, leads to wonder if they have the cloth or leather seats. My car has the leather seat option, which are the most comfortable seats I have ever found in car, it has an inflateble lumbar support, and side adjustments, which I love. I have also ridden in and driven Mustangs with the cloth seats, which I do find to be hard. Maybe it's the material that does this. I also will agree with the comments about the blind spots on the vehicle as well, but you also learn to live with as well.

The rear seats however were only meant for children, or small adults. The trunk space is also limited on it, but I can fit 2 golf bags into it, but nothing else. So long road trips in the car are best with only 2 people.

The A/C and heater dare excellent, even in hot weather, with teh top down, the A/C provides enough cooling, and in cool weather, with the top down the heather keeps you warm. With the top up, the A/C gets cold enough to require me to put it on the lower setting, and the heater, once the engine is warm, the two lowest setting keep you comfortable, even in 0 degree weather.

OVERALL:

I would be hard pressed to find a car I would trade it in on. Which I really don't see happening, I believe I will keep this car for a long time. And when I do purchse my next car, I will keep this one.

This car is fun to drive, handles well (could use a little improvement), very fast. I've found to be very stable at high speeds (130 mph personal best). The handling could be improved by better tires, and stiffer shocks. But is smooth on most roads as it is, rougher roads do rattle you a bit, but expected. It does have a few squeeks and rattles, but also expected in a convertible.

But I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone who has family or is planning on one, the space is limited, it's really more of a 2 person car, but can be used for 4 on shorter trips. 

But there is nothing like putting the top down after a long day, and feeling the wind in your hair.
