            I drove this car during just this year and let me tell you that it is a  pretty good car. The F-150 has spacious rear seats that I ever sat in for pickups. It has room for six people and also has recliners and armrests. It includes standard adjustable accelerator and brake pedals. You can also included ABS and 4-wheel disc brakes. And anti-theft system with overhead console with power moonroof.

The engine that the Ford F-150 uses is a 5.4 liter Triton V8 engine offering the most torque in pickup class. It also has 260 horsepower and electronic shift on the fly which means u don't have to stop the car to switch it to 4 wheel drive. I recommend this car to those workers who always have to load stuff in their cars for work because this car is also has an optional bed extender which flips out into the tail gate providing you with a seven foot cargo space.<br><br>
