            I have a ford aspire that i bought new.It is a 1997 model,two door and of course it is a four cylinder.I bought it new.I get about 35-40 miles per gallon and it only takes about $8.00 to fill it up.If you are looking for a car that is great on fuel this is the one for you.It has a smooth very quiet engine.cheap to keep up and very affordable.Tires are 13 inch and very inexpensive.It however is not the car for you if you have a family or very large people.it is kind of crowded even for two people.It comes equipped with am/fm/cassette stero,airconditioning.comfort is great even for a small car.plenty of overhead room for tall slender people.if you are heavy in weight you probably would not want this car.if you travel long distances to work it is great on your budget.i am very satisfied with the way my aspire handles the road and i find that it suits my needs well.In the two years that I have owned it I have had no brakedowns to this point.<br><br>
