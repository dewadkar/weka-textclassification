            A few weekends ago, we went up north to the small town I grew up in.  We had decided to rent a car for the weekend, and seeing as how we're not rolling in huge mountains of money (yet), we reserved a compact car to make the journey.  When we got to the car rental place, they had run out of cars but had lots of minivans and SUVs.  We opted for an Explorer.

When we got to the garage we took a double-take at the back of the Explorer.  There was a pickup truck-style payload back there.  Sure, not as large as a regular pickup, because the Explorer has full sized back seats, but it could still hold alot.

The Sport-Trac is definitely geared toward the youth market.  It has all the "people room" of a fancy SUV, with "cargo room" at the back that you wouldn't mind loading with a ton of dirt or something, because it's outside the vehicle, rather than inside a luxurious one.

The payload area is extendable, however, with a nifty little cage apparatus that swings out and locks when the tailgate is down.

We gave the Sport-Trac a good run while we had it, running up 500 km (300 miles) in about a day and a half, even taking it over some really rough roads to try out the 4X4 capabilities.  No problems in that department.

The engine is big and powerful, probably capable of handling mid-sized towing loads like fair-sized boats without any noticable difficulty.

One of our favourite features was the electronic rear window.  Punch a button and the window cracks open a couple of inches.  Twist it one way and the middle 80% of the rear window disappears behind the rear seats.  Our passengers in the back seat absolutely loved riding with the window open, especially off the highway, where engine noise was minimal.

Overall, a great combination pickup-SUV! I'd rent another in a second.  Lots of fun to drive, and although it does look a little strange at first, the appearance grows on you.
