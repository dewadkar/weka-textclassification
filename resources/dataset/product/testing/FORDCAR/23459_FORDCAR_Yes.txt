            My recent purchase of the 2000 Ford Taurus SE was an easy one.  Ford really has outdone itself with this model.  The sleeker design and roomier interior make for an all round better car.  Not to mention that the V6 engine gives the car the power that it needs to run like a dream.  I enjoy knowing that I am safe with the dual air bags and anti-lock breaks.  Anyone who is looking for an affordable car that has a lot of room and is considered one of the safest cars on the road should consider this vehicle.  If you are into smaller sportier cars then you should not even think about the Taurus since it looks like a sophisticated up-town car.  To conclude, the Taurus has everything that a car buyer would want: looks, room, power and safety.<br><br>
