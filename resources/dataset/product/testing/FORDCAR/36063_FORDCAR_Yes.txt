            	I have test-driven a number of cars in the last year, with the intention of buying a 2000 model. I had my heart set on a Subaru Outback Sport, but Ford changed my mind. The Focus is the only car, that I have driven, offered by an American manufacturer that rivals Japanese cars in terms of quality, fit and finish, and overall performance. And it does it at a fraction of the price.

	My local Ford dealer had a Focus ZX3 in the showroom, equipped with the optional AC and side-impact airbags, with a sticker price of $13,850. That's $5000 less than the Outback Sport's base price! And after my trade-in (a beat-up Chevy van) and the fact that the dealer was willing to knock $900 off the sticker price, I got the car for under $12,000.

	I purchased the ZX3 right after Christmas and have just had the 3000 mile service done. A couple of problems cropped up along the way. The car was delivered to me with the driver's side seatback release lever broken off. Someone's kid climbed into the car and used the handle for a step while mommy was shopping for Contours. When the part went on backorder, the dealer canibalized an identical seat out of another Focus rather than make me wait.

	About a month later, the airbag light came on. It turned out to be a bad clockspring and it was changed out. Everything was covered under the warranty, and the car has been a joy to own and drive otherwise.

	The car's handling reminds me of one of my favorite cars of all time. The VW GTi I owned years ago. It is very crisp and communicative, and it steadfastly refuses to understeer. When pushed to the point at which most front-drive cars begin to push the front end, the Focus gives a funny "tucking in" feel and claws its way through the corner.

	The engine leaves a little to be desired in terms of power, especially in the low end of the tach. Keep it spinning near its 4200 rpm power peak, though, and it will reward you with smooth, useful acceleration. All while entertaining you with a racy exhaust snarl that never becomes intrusive or annoying.

	Another similarity the Focus shares with my beloved GTi is a roomy interior. I am 6'4" and weigh 230 pounds. I need lots of space to be comfortable in a car. The Focus has it and more, without seeming too tall or boxy.
	On the other hand, the seat's height adjuster means my 5'2" wife is perfectly comfortable driving the Focus as well.

	My only disappointment with the Focus is that cruise control and power windows weren't available on the ZX3 when I bought it. That has since changed, and the 2001 ZX3 has a long list of optional goodies like 16-wheels.

	If you're looking for a small car with Honda-like quality but can't stomach Honda prices, the Ford Focus should definitely be on your short list.
