            Although I already owned a 97 Windstar, I found out that we were expecting our third child and the old van only had one side door. Not being terribly loyal car owners, my wife and I considered practically all major minivan models (less than $30,000) in making our decision.

First, the bad news: minivans have gone up a *lot* in price over the last few years. The popularity of the minivan also affected our decision as well because both the Honda Odyssey and the Toyota Sienna were difficult to find. In fact, the Honda was nowhere to be found in a 5-state area. The Toyota was more plentiful, but the sticker price was practically the same price you paid out the door (plus tax). Not wanting to pony-up $30K without dickering, I decided to check out the Windstars again.

I must say that Ford must be doing something right with the SEL model. Practically every feature that I had two years ago has been updated: the stereo allows the second row to listen to and control a separate media source than the front (radio front-CD back); the drink holders are bigger and more numerous; there is more room for the driver (I'm 6'6&quot;); the leather seats are amazingly comfortable; the dual automatic remote side-doors are unique among all the minivans; and the outside styling is drop-dead gorgeous.

When comparing the Windstar to other vans, please keep this in mind: the Toyota drives a little more lightly (essentially like a Camry) and is noticeably smaller; the Honda has a cool hideaway rear seat but is scarce; the Chrysler products have worse reliability and slightly higher sticker prices (??); and Ford allows you to deal on the price!! I got mine for about $2,000 under sticker.

I would recommend the Windstar (and have been) to practically every family I know. I feel that it's hard to go wrong with practically any minivan in today's market, but I like the Windstar for its styling, room, price, dual power doors, and praise from friends and neighbors.<br><br>
