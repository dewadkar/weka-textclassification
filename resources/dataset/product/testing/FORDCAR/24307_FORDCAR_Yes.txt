            My family is big on Ford, if you look in our driveway you will see an Escort, a Mustang, a F350 and two Rangers, all of which are Ford cars. I myself have owned two Escorts. My aunt and uncle gave the first car I got to me; they gave me a Sentra. With in the month I decided my car was very lonely and should make some friends, so I helped it out and introduced it to a Ford F150�.they got along a little too well. So yes, I totaled my first car with in a month of getting it. Needless to say my parents really didn�t trust me too much after that. So I didn�t drive my own car again for about 6 months. 

We had an extra �82 Escort that my step-father�s mother gave us after driving it since it was brand new. It sat idol in our driveway for quite sometime. Finally, not driving got to me, and I begged for the right to use it. It wasn�t the classiest car, come on it was as old as me, but I was desperate. So I drove the car. The reliability of the car really annoyed me; it had some 180,000 miles on it and was still going strong. My parents told me that I wouldn�t get a new car until the Escort died, because if we had it I should use it. I begged, �Mom the car is as old as me�.it has no air conditioning, for the love of god pity me� but they wouldn�t listen, I was told to be happy with what I had. So I drove the car, finding myself secretly wishing it would break down so I could get a new car. But it never did. 

It took a lot of begging on my part to have my parents to go car shopping with me. I ended up with another Escort, a 94 model, It is great, and not the sharpest looking car, but it is definitely cute. I have power/heated mirrors, automatic seatbelts, heating/air, and a CD player. It�s the sports model, which means that I am the lucky one who gets the spoiler. I haven�t had any problems with the car since I got it. Its manual and call me unusual but I love driving a manual transmission. 

Overall Escorts are a great first car (Or third as the case may be) It looks like an Escort party when I have some of my close friends over. (We all have them) None of my friends have had any problems with their cars, and I haven�t with mine. 

The car has a fair amount of power. I can easily go 100mph, not that I do. I looked down once and realized that I was accidentally going far to fast. The pick up is great, but it is always better when driving a stick. And the gas mileage couldn�t be better. 

The price of the car is also amazing, I got my �94 model for $3,000 even though the blue-book value is $5,000-6,000. And with brand new Escorts(I was looking at one to buy) as long as you are a good shopper, you can get one with a few options for less than $10,000.

Overall I would definitely recommend this to someone for themselves or as a first car for their kids.
