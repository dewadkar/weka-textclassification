            I ordered a black w/tan 2 tone, F-150 extended cab Lariat with short bed and flare sides new in 1997.  I arrived at the dealer to pick it up after a 3 month wait, saw it sitting there and just said, "Wow." The dealer actually tried to talk me out of taking it.  Said he could sell it five times over in 10 minutes for several thousand dollars more.  The price came down as they usually do, as the supply began to meet demand, but I don't regret a penny.   

This is an awesome truck, even 5 years later.  

The paint looks great with very little care besides a monthly wash and the (very) occasional wax.  Classy, sleek, clean-lined and luxurious with the tan leather interior, which has worn beautifully.  The interior design is perfect and completely intuitive; when you reach out for something you find it right where you think it should be.  But at it's heart it is still a big, tough Ford truck.  We have never had a single problem in five years although just recently have noticed some whining sounds when turning the wheel hard right or left.  Lubing has not helped so I'll have to get it checked out.  But we count ourselves fortunate that that is the most of our worries thus far.  

This truck is bold and confident in the mud and muck and a comfortable ride on the highway.  It hauls wood, hay and the occasional antique happily and tows with ease.  It handles well, brakes reliably and does it duties like a good Boy Scout.

It is very rare in life that one comes across products that truly exceed ones expectations.  Ford really did it with this truck.
