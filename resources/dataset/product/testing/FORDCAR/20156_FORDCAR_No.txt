            If you get this car, I would suggest getting a cell phone because it is going to leave you stranded. We bought a 92 Aerostar and as you can guess, It literally fell apart. We had to replace the engine, transmission, brake stuff, and many other vital parts. It left us stranded on I-17 200 miles from home with a 4 wheel drive. This means that you need a flatbed tow truck so that the gears didn't get screwed up. Also, The electronics fail all of the time. This means that the windows, radio, ignition, lights, air etc don't work. The car currently has multiple undetectable flaws that leave us wondering if we bought the wrong car. Now, We know. DO NOT BUY THIS CAR!! The only thing good about it is the space. Any car company can do that though! <br><br>
