            With gas prices inflating, mileage accumulating on my current vehicle (modified 90lx/saleen mustang) and the desire for something new and different I decided to go car shopping. I was looking for something fun to drive, sporty, with a good options package and warranty. I also wanted something that I would not be embarrassed to drive (New VW bug, or Ford Focus). Having Previously owned a high performance vehicle I wanted to stay along those lines. I had looked at the Audi A4, Volkswagon Jetta, The Chevy Malibu LS, and the Ford Contour SE/SVT.

After much consideration I decided out of the vehicles listed the Ford Contour SVT offered the most attractive package. Being third in price only to the SE model and the Malibu, the SVT come with a lot of luxury features for a relatively small price. My model (2000, black with midnight blue interior) came fully loaded with a sticker price of 23,000 but after a little bargaining was down to 19,900 including tax and tags. 

The SVT model comes standard with; leather seats, covered steering wheel, leather shift boot, power moon roof (very nice), power driver�s seat, factory alarm, five spoke alloy wheels, side skirt kit, SVT badges, in dash CD player, and high performance audio system. About the only options you end up paying for are the optional spoiler and the smokers package 

One thing you should know is that this car is only available in a five speed manual transition, so if your not a fan of shifting or don�t know how to drive standard look elsewhere. It has ample room for the two front passengers but is a little cramped in the rear. There is a good deal of trunk space and the two rear seats fold down to allow for the transporting of larger cargo. The seats are soft and the leather is very high quality, it is also perforated which adds to the unique look of the interior. The included cup holders are highly functional to a degree (no 7 11 big gulps but the average beverages fit without a problem). The hydraulic assisted clutch makes shifting a breeze, and the liquid filled motor mounts reduce engine noise and vibration.

One thing I must say about this car is that its handling is amazing. My prior vehicle had over $1,500 dollars in suspension modifications done to it and right off the lot this car put it to shame, I would even say that this is as good a cornering car as the 325i or the M3. As for performance the SVT comes with a 200hp 24valve engine. Not as much power as my old mustang but enough to satisfy my needs. It has a lot of pep off the line but kind of drowns out as your RPMs get higher.

I cannot stress how much I love the way this car handles; it has a much smoother ride than my old car, and the only car that I have been in that rides better is a Cadillac Eldorado. 

The standard warranty available is 3 years 36,000 miles, however for roughly $900 more I opted for the premium plan, 6 year 60,000 miles with the most I pay for any repair being fifty dollars.

If you want something that is fun to drive, has a professional appearance, and is not tough on the wallet than seriously consider the Ford Contour SVT. It has all the features that you would want and is thousands less than most of the competitors.
