            I bought a 1997, low mileage, Ford F150 Pickup truck after carefully comparing the pro's and con's of the mini van's equipped with lifts and other assistive devices that could be added if necessary, available and what my personal needs were since I use a scooter to get around.

The maneuverability of the F150 is easier to handle than the mini-vans and the seating gives one a better sense of stability and visibility of the road.  The F150, has all the comforts one would have in a car or mini-van in the cab and because the bed of the truck is good sized, it allows for more flexibility in transporting whatever one need to transport.

With a little imagination and a good Trailer fabricator one can create the necessary equipment to get a scooter or wheelchair into the bed with the push of a button. <br><br>
