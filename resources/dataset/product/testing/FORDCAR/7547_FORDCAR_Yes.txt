            Today, waiting to checkout... 

Cashier Number 3 finished ringing up the order of the lady three ahead of me in Line Number 3, and asked if there was anything else. Why yes, she replied, there was one more little thing. It seemed that she'd been unable to find a 25 pound bag of beans. Yes, she looked on Aisle 13, but she couldn't find them. I swallowed hard, fearing the worst. 

Let me just say right here that there's only two things I believe: 

First, cashiers are for cashiering, shoppers are for shopping. If you get to the front of the line and realize you forgot to get toilet paper, don't expect the cashier to wipe your ass. Just pay for what few things you did manage to remember and move along, please. Our ice cream is melting. 

Second, I believe this woman should get a 1994 Ford F150, like the one I have. She could use it to haul her feed. 

And third, I believe nobody needs 25 pounds of beans.  

Looking at the other lines, I noticed that Line Number 1 had only two people in it. I almost bolted for it--but then I noticed that both people only had a few items. I instantly knew that Line Number 1 was an Express Line, probably 10 items-or-less. Maybe 12. I looked in my basket at the Things I Wasn't to Come Home Without, and quit counting at 14. Line Number 2 contained four folks, each with huge, teetering mounds of groceries piled in their carts.

Back in my line, the worst happened, as I feared it would. The cashier said she'd be happy to go on over to Aisle 13 and see if she couldn't scare up one of them big bags of beans. Damn. Another person got in Line Number 2.

By now, if you've ever bought food near the West coast, I'm sure you've guessed that my 1994 Ford F150 was outside, leaking transmission fluid in the parking lot at an Albertsons store. It used to be a Lucky store, but Albertsons bought them out to screw me.

After a while, Cashier Number 3 came back, struggling under the load of a big bag of beans. She didn't go back into her cashiering area, but showed the bag to the lady and said that all she'd been able to find were 10 pound bags of beans and 17-and-a-half pound bags of beans, and she'd brought along this 17-and-a-halfer to see if it would be okay... or she could go back and fetch a couple of them 10-pounders. While the lady pondered her choices, I gave up and slunk over to the back of Line Number 2. I was sixth in line, and wishing I'd driven my 1994 Ford F150 to Safeway instead.

Time passed, and I finally made it to the on-deck circle. My cart was unloaded, and the guy behind me had already put down one of those dividers to keep my stuff from spilling into his. Only a few more minutes, and I'd be in my 1994 Ford F150, heading home down the Monterey Highway.

On my right, in Line Number 1, the cashier got in a shouting match with a customer over exactly how many twelve-packs of Sprite she could get at the Special Price. The customer was clearly right, but Cashier Number 1 ran a tight ship, and was unmoved by either the accuracy or the volume of the customer's argument. Eventually the customer stormed out of the store without buying anything, and Cashier Number 1 resumed her duties, muttering under her breath. 

Don't bother muttering under your breath in my 1994 Ford F150. I'll never hear you over the rattles.

Ahead of me, Cashier Number 2 finished ringing up the order. Imagine my surprise when this customer also wanted a little something extra--would the cashier mind trotting over and snagging him a couple packs of Winston Lights? Of course, the cigarettes are no longer stored near the registers--too convenient. Now they're kept in locked Cabinets, waaaay over there. Cashier Number 2 had to get the key from Cashier Number 1.  

Cashier Number 2 unlocked Cabinet Number 1, looked around, grabbed a couple of packs of Winston Lights, locked the door, returned the keys, and came back to his register. All the customer had to do was say thanks, and it'd be my turn at last.

If you own a 1994 Ford F150, you probably already know that when one thing goes wrong, more things are about to go wrong. Another inequity is on the way--perhaps so unjust that even a pleasant drive in a 1994 Ford F150 wouldn't cheer you up. 

My frozen food was beginning to drip. 

Rather than saying thanks to Cashier Number 2, and getting the hell out of my way, the customer said hey, not so fast--she wanted Winston Lights in hard little boxes, not these wimpy soft packs. Come on--she'd show him.

Off they go, stopping off at Cashier Number 1 to get the keys. Cashier Number 1 unlocked Cabinet Number 1 again and replaced the offending Winston Lights, with their disgusting soft packages. They look for, but do not find, the hard packs. The woman can't understand why Albertsons doesn't keep more Winston Lights in hard packages in stock. They discuss it while they look through Cabinet Number 2 and Cabinet Number 3. Finally the lady said she'd go ahead and take the soft packs.

There are two things I believe:

First, I believe Albertsons sucks. I liked the old Lucky store, with their dumb little club cards you had to use to get the discounts. Whenever someone checked out without using a Lucky card, everyone in line would look knowingly at each other, quietly enjoying their superiority.

Second, I believe Express Lines should be identified by the efficiency of the Cashier rather than the quantity of the customers selections.

And third, I believe that if you ever find yourself carrying a big bag of beans and smoking a Winston Light... you'd better not step out in front of any 1994 Ford F150s.<br><br>
