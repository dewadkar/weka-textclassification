            Have owned my Focus 9 months and have logged 19,000 miles. Averaging over 30 MPG and my opinion is that this is one of the best small cars I have ever owned. It's a fun car to drive, has a solid feel and very quiet inside. I would have opt for leather seats as the upholstery gives me static shocks. I must mention that most cars that have fabric material do the same. For the money this car is a excellent buy. I would like to add that the inside headroom was important as I wear a hat and most small cars are deficient in that category. The dash layout is also a consideration as all controls are within reach.<br><br>
