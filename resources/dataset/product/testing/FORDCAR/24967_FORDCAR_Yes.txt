            My husband bought me a Laser Red w/dark tint 1999 Anniversary Edition Mustang.  I have had 3 Mustangs before this one and with out a doubt this is the finest car that I have ever owned. Drives great, handles beautifully and gets many looks.  This is one fantastic automobile.  We bought this vehicle for the fun of it.  My husband wanted a muscle car and I guess this is the closest he will ever get to owning one.  This car is not made for the 16-18 age bracket.  You see, the speedometer has 150 mph on it and I know those youngsters would try to do it.  It is so much fun to drive. Although it will not be comfortable for larger adults in the back seat, but its is good for the smaller members of your family. It is also not priced for the younger person to afford very easily and the insurance rates are a little higher even for us older folks.  I would not part with my Mustang, and God help you if you bump my doors.  This is a wonderful machine.  My hats off to the Ford Motor Co. for this gem!!!!!<br><br>
