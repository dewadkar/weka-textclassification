            I recently purchased a 2000 Ford Excursion. As the father of 4 children, vehicle space is very important. We finally have a vehicle that we can all ride in without anyone being cramped. I have 2 teenagers, and whether they sit in the middle row of seats or the last, they have plenty of room. Driving is very nice. The truck corners and handles much better than I would have expected. Parking is another story. No more looking for the space closest to the store. While this may seem like a major issue to some people, I new what to expect when I bought it. The ride is not bad, but it is a truck. If you are looking for something that floats down the road, get a Cadillac, if you want a large vehicle with plenty of room, and you don't mind feeling the bumps a little, this is a great truck.

1 year update.

After a year of driving this truck, I still enjoy it. Maintenance costs have been very reasonable, and trips to the dealer for warranty work have been 3. The rear power quarter window came loose from the arm that opens and closes it. This required nothing more than a re-application of the glue that holds it on. The second trip was due to dealer error. After 2 days, the window would no longer work. Too much glue. Otherwise, everything is great. I had hoped fuel mileage might increase after the engine was broken in, and it has to a small degree. Still only about 10-11 around town and 15-16 on the freeway.<br><br>
