            I just recently received a Ford Escort ZX2 as a birthday gift.  I was over-whelmed to take it out for the first time!  It is very cute and sporty at the same time making it a automatic winner.  I love the cute shape of the outside of the car as well as the inside.  The slopping dash-board always catches everyone's eye as well as the position of the gear-sick and emergency pull-brake.  The seats are so comfortable, I could live in there!  It is so exciting driving a manuel 5 speed and knowing everyone is looking at you with jealousy.  I absolutely love the 6 CD changer which came in the trunk and the smooth radio front.  This car is very smooth while driving on any road at any speed.  It is always smooth and you know you will have a great ride.  I have had no problems with it so far that are anything major with the car.  So far all I have done to fix up my car is to put a &quot;bra&quot; on the front and I have put new tires and rims on it.  It is a excellent and dependable car.  The only thing that my friends would say is not the best quality is the smallness of the back seat.  However, I rate that as a plus.  It does have a smaller rear seat that most full sized car; but I see that as a step up from the rest!  I recommend this car to everyone that is wanting a fun car to drive.  <br><br>
