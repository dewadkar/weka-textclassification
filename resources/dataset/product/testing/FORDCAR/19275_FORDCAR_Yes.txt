            I have a 1997 Contour SE Sport.  I bought this car because I'm not really into cars all that much.  I really wanted a car that looks decent, was a reasonable price, and was dependable.  All of my needs have been met with this car.  

It isn't a little tiny car that I won't feel safe in and it has the safety features I wanted.  It looks nice and though it's not really sporty, I'm happy to be seen driving it.  It's quiet and gets very good gas mileage - probably because it has a 4-cylinder engine.  Even though it's a 4-cylinder, I don't have problems getting a move on when I need to.  

It handles nicely and I really enjoy driving it.  It's not a luxury car by any standards, but it's very comfortable and has power everything which is great.  It also has an overdrive which I found quite handy when I've driven in snowy conditions.  I've never had to put it in the shop for any reason.  

I'd recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a mid-range dependable automobile.<br><br>
