            I have owned this bad boy for 8 years now.  Since I bought it with 34,000 I have had nothing but enjoyment from it.  I have no complaints about the engine, body, just about anything except the gas mileage.  I now have 77,000 miles and the car still runs like the day I bought it.  
Recently I was rearended and was very excited about how well the car held up considering what I have heard.  I was hit by a car going just over 10 miles an hour.  After the accident the car was driveable and I drove it for about 2 months before getting it fixed!  It took so long because I couldn't find a body shop I trusted.  
I do have a few downers beofore I let you go.  The car leaks, and when it rains I often have a drip that soaks my leg.  I also have noticed a small wet area on the passenger side floor, but I really can't figure out where that comes from.  The trunk also leaked a bit before the accident.
The motor for the top has continued to weaken over the years, but I have come to find out this is a problem many people have experienced.  I probably will need to fix this in the coming years.
Overall I love the car despite the leaks and motor.  I would definitely consider buying another Mustang and would recommend one to my friends.
