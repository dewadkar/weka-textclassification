            I bought this van 9 months ago and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It has good visability, a comfortable feel, and more than enough room. 
The driver's side seating is a bit cramped, but not too bad--and I'm 6.0.
Being such a big vehicle I have never found myself exceeding the speed limit, which is good if you live in a town with 25-35mph zones like I do.
This is my first excursion into ford territory. I went with ford because I liked their look, and they seemed to be the cargo van of choice by most companies I noticed. I traditionally have heard bad things about ford but decided to go with one anyways. It burns about 1 1/2 quarts of oil per 3000mls on the 351 that I have.
Except for the oil burning the van has been pretty reliable. I think, like most cars, there are good ones and bad ones.
I Change the oil regularly and the tranny fluid every 50,000mls. I'd suggest beefing up the wimpy suspension with some billstein shocks. Otherwise, from looking at the rather extensive records the original owner provided, it seems like a reliable and affordable van. It's roomy, and the double sidewall and truck chasis gives it a fairly solid ride.
It goes through brakes pretty often, and goes out of allignment more than other vehicles I've owned, but it is a big van, right? The tires need to be faithfully rotated or be prepared to replace them early.
