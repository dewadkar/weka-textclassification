            I bought my ranger new after driving a few of the competing models.  I now have 113,000 miles on it and on balance, I don't regret it.  It is more comfortable on longer hauls than any of the others, especially for taller folk.  It also has the most substantial and luxurious feel of the models I tested.  The 4.0 liter V-6 (the largest engine available makes for plenty of get-up.  The gas mileage--nothing to write home about.  I do a lot of long distance driving as well as a fair amount of metro stuff and I've averaged a consistant 17.8.  There have been a few problems, elec window operator, dome light quit functioning, and a couple of other small electrical problems cropped up after 75,000 miles.  All of these should have been very small events but for the incompetent and apathetic dealer service department I had the displeasure of dealing with. 
I know that one of the imports would have been superior in some categories such as dependability and longevity but not worth the sacrifice in comfort for a vehicle I spend so much time in.<br><br>
