            My wife and I bought the truck at the end of '97 when we decided we needed a vehicle to haul stuff for our newly built house. So we bought a 4-cyl., manual transmission Ranger with the extended cab.

The engine was somewhat underpowered and the gearshift is a little wobbly. The brakes are decent, but sometimes hard to modulate. The ride quality is pretty much what you expect from a truck.
I wouldn't want to tow with the 4-cyl. engine, but the truck has moved everything from mulch to furniture in its lifetime.

I can't decide if the interior is plain with the focus on practical, or practical with the focus on plain. However, the build quality was surprisingly good, and not even the slightest piece of plastic trim has come apart. The controls are well designed and easy to use.
The seats are somewhat hard, and some people have complained about them after long rides.

I have maintained the truck myself and was able to do so at minimal cost. 
With the exception of the oil/fuel/air filters, fluids and windshield wipers, the truck has all its OEM parts at 45K miles.
I've had zero repairs so far.

In summary, the truck is reliable, is less than exciting, but does what it was designed for.
