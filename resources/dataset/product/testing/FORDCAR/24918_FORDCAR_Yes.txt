            I should first mention that I am posting this review to those who are interested in this cars real world performance.
   I was first taken by the amazing handling of this car. I have driven the previous model year mustang and they definitely get &quot;squirrely&quot; very easily. This mustang powers into corner like its on a track. When the car begins to slide sideways it is very fluid and can be controlled quite freely. It requires very little to no oversteer or understeer to keep it guided on the path which you intend for it. You can run over some pretty large bumps while taking a hard turn (or even when in a power slide) and the car is virtually unaffected. The only problem I have with the handling characteristics is that when the rear tires break traction on a hard turn, the car has an extreme desire to spin around. Once in the spin, it takes a visciously fast combination of oversteer,understeer, and throttle manipulation to keep the car under control. If you like to do donuts it is loads of fun. The short wheelbase lends the car to 360 degree rotation with almost no effort. The automatic transmission makes high performance controlled manuevers much more difficult so I would highly recommend getting the manual transmission if your looking for &quot;balls out&quot; fun.
    The engine of the GT run very smoothly even at high RPMs. However, if you are going to get the automatic tranny I would suggest upgrading to the Cobra model. Use of the powerband is very limited with the automatic and in order to compete with other sports cars on the road it needs more power. I'm sure the lower gearing in the manual transmission would make much better use of the relatively scarce amount of horsepower in the GT. A manual transmission would also give better control in any &quot;traction breaking&quot; moves. Straight line performance in the GT leaves much to be desired and it might be worth waiting to see if Ford is going to add more base power to their lineup.
     High speed performance with this car is quite acceptable for urban/suburban highways. Those with access to rural highways may be disappointed by the acceleration at higher speeds and the overall top speed. the handling, once again, is absolutely amazing at high speeds. No matter what the speedometer reads you feel confidently in control. The convertible version has a slightly frightening overall sound at high speeds do to the combination of wind,road and drivetrain noise. Even so, the feel of the car is solid.
     The interior is quite comfortable for the driver and front seat passenger. Unfortunately the back seat is very cramped and does not lend itself well to even short road trips (1-2 hours).The Chevy Camaro, with its longer wheelbase, is a better choice if rear seat comfort is a priority. The front seating position is wonderful from a center of gravity standpoint. The seat is positioned well for hard driving and enhances the ability to get a &quot;feel&quot; for how the car is going to react under extreme driving conditions. Controls for all the essentials (throttle,brake,shifter,steering wheel, etc.) are positioned so that they seem to fall into your hands. The other controls (radio,cd player, climate controls) are sometimes awkward to access while driving.
    Overall I have to say that I am pleased with the car for my situation. It is perfect for the person who wants some level of performance, but not so much that an inexperience driver is going to be overwhelmed. If your looking for performance, go with the cobra and a manual transmission. If your getting a car for your wife get the base V-6 model, it looks just as pretty and most women aren't too concerned with the &quot;bragging rights&quot; of the V-8. If, like me, you refuse to settle for too little power and your significant other is intimidated by too much power the GT is the perfect choice. Throw in the convertible and it becomes quite satisfying for both.<br><br>
