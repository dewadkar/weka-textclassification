            This Ford is the best SUV that I have driven.  It is big, roomy, and other cars on the road certainly see you coming.  It has a big mean looking front end and a very tall profile.  This SUV drives more like a sedan than a truck, with a decent turn radius and nice acceleration.  Of course the EB edition is a nice thing to have but not necessary.  The interior is layed out nicely with enough room for your little ones to roam around the back without tripping over everyones feet.  The 60/40 bench right behind the driver and passenger seats is nice and makes it easy to haul big or long cargo around town.  Of course if you really need to haul big stuff the Expedition has the muscle to bring your big &quot;man&quot; toys anywhere you want.  

The price is a little high but hey, what do you expect for such a fine vehicle?  It fits nicely in between the smaller Explorer and the larger Excursion.  The gas mileage isn't in the bragging rights of this beast but it compares to the Suburban and Tahoe nicely.  I wouldn't call this an entry level SUV.... start with something smaller first.  Or just go buy a truck.  But if you have outgrown your truck or small size SUV, the Expedition is the way to go.<br><br>
