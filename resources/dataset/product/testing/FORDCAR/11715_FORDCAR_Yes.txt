            I have always been a car enthusiast.  I do not like owning or driving boring vehicles.  The good news is that exciting does not always equal expensive.  

In July 2002, I purchased a 2002 Focus ZX3 with air conditioning as the only option.  The 2002 ZX3 includes the following standard features:
-- 2.0L 130 bhp 16 valve 4 cylinder 
-- 5 speed manual transmission
-- Interval wipers
-- AM/FM stereo with single CD player

I only paid $11,500 for my Focus and have been extremely pleased with the car. My commute involves a few miles of quiet country road and the little ZX3 zips through the curves with great confidence.  The first two Focus model years suffered from some pretty extensive quality problems. I'm pretty confident (knock on wood) that most issues have been addressed for 2002. The price was so low that I took the risk and have had no problems or recalls to date.

Here is a breakdown of the things I like and dislike about my Focus.

Pros:
-- Great handling and steering
-- Engine has adequate power for daily commute
-- Transmission is very smooth
-- Interior controls are generally high quality and ergonomically placed
-- Seats are very supportive
-- Interior is much roomier than it looks.  It easily fits four full size adults.

Cons:
-- There is a definite lack of sound insulation.  There are no squeaks or rattles but wind and engine noise are evident.
-- Fit and finish could be better.  The bumper covers, in particular do not fit well.

Another exciting aspect of the Focus is the large availability of aftermarket parts for both interior, exterior, and drivetrain.  This may not appeal to some but it adds interesting options to customize your Focus to suit your particular personality.

The bottom line is that, while I don't confuse my Focus with a BMW, I am continuously impressed with the level of car offered for under $12,000.
