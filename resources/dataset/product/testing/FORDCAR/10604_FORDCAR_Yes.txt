            I had bought a new 1999 ranger xlt 4 cyl. in Feb. of 1999, and as fate would have it, we bought a boat a few months later.  My little truck would not pull the boat so we decided to trade it in on another Ranger.  While at the dealer I discovered the new Trailhead model ranger. It only comes in the xl package, so if carpet is high on your list, forget this one.  It comes with the 3.0 flexible fuel system which can run on ethenol or unleaded gas.
 The truck is a 2wd ranger on a 4wd chassis/platform.  It has a standard tranny cooler and a  4:10 rearend, so pulling a boat with this small truck is NO problem. If you yank out the catalitic converter and replace it w/ a catco free-flower, put on a set of magnecore wires, torquemaster plugs, and a 2 chamber flowmaster muffler, you are gonna blow the doors off a 4.0.  The truck handles well, and has good ground clearance. No problem with cornering either, this truck can take 'em at pretty good speeds. 
I really like this model. It's competetion is the Toyota pre-runner, and, also made at the Ford factory is the Mazda Troy Lee edition, which is basically the same as the Trailhead, except it is available w/ an extended cab, and has carbon fiber dash goodies. Don't expect to go too far on a tank of gas, though, thanks to the 4:10 rear end.<br><br>
