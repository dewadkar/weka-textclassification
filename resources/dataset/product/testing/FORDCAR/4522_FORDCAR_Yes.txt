            After driving a 4-door Explorer for 3 years, the Explorer Sport is definitely refreshing.

The Explorer Sport has much better handling than the 4-door, and seems to get up and go a lot faster than the 4-door.  Although the cargo space in the back is less than its normal-size big brother, the legroom for backseat passengers is not noticeably tighter (at least my tall friends haven't whined about it yet, and they are used to the 4-door).

One downside of the electronic seats is that it makes it difficult for people to get into the backseat through the driver side door.  But, the shotgun seat moves forward far enough to allow larger individuals to easily jump into the backseat.  The functionality of the cockpit is pretty cool.  For example, there is an additional lighter adapter on the passenger side for plugging in accessories like a cell phone.  


If you live or work in an area with limited parking, the smaller size may let you squeeze into a few more parking spots.  The agility of the 2-door also makes city driving a breeze.  

I love my 2-door even more than my 4-door!!!<br><br>
