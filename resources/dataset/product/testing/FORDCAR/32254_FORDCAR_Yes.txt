            Last week my husband Randy and I decided to take a trip to Cincinnati to watch the Atlanta Braves play the Reds for our anniversary celebration. When we travel, we always prefer to rent a compact car and usually use Avis Rental. We had reserved a compact car for three days for $153.26. When we went to the airport to pick up our compact car, we were very surprised when the lady told us that all she had available for us to drive was a 2001 Ford Windstar Van! My first thought was that Randy would be doing all of the driving. There was no way that I was going to drive a big van in a large city. The lady even let us rent this van for the same cost that she had given us on the compact car, since she did not have one available.

We have owned vans in the past and I must admit that I thought they drove more like a truck than a car. But I was definitely wrong with this minivan.  It had an automatic transmission, loaded with many extras, such as cruise control, CD and tape player, power windows and an electronic key entry. Our 2001 Ford Windstar Minivan LX had two regular doors for the front seats and two sliding doors which really made it easier to get in and out of the van. There was also a rear window that we did have some difficulty trying to unlock it. This van could seat seven people comfortably since there was two bucket seats in the front that had armrests that you could use or leave up. Then there was a smaller bench seat in the second row that could seat two people and allow you to get back to the rear bench seat that seated three more people. I liked the fact that there were sliding doors on both sides of the van and you could easily get to the back bench seats without any problems.

As you probably have guessed by now, I did decide to drive the van for a little while and it was so easy to manipulate in and out of lanes. The seats had me up high enough that I had a very good view of the road. There was even a special mirror that you could pull down and use if you had an infant in the back seat. I liked the big windows because they provided a good visual field. My husband did most of the driving and he said that this van was very good on gas mileage. We averaged about twenty-two miles per gallon of gas. It had a twenty-six gallon tank, so we did not have to stop a lot to fill up for gas. This van has a 3.8 liter V-6 engine. It also had a fully electronic 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission. This minivan had a lot of power whenever we accelerated to pass a vehicle. The ride was very smooth and the front seats had high back cloth bucket seats with adjustable seat tracks. There were also air bags in the front seat for both the driver and the passenger side.

The solar tinted  glass helped to keep the van cool, but the air conditioner was wonderful. There was even controls in the middle section of the van so that the passengers in the back seats could regulate their own temperatures. This is known as the high capacity climate control system with adjustable temperature, fan and rear seat control. The tires were P215/70R15 with fifteen inch five spoke wheel covers. There was a mini-spare tire in the back.

Although I have already mentioned that the minivan had a CD/tape player, it also had an AM/FM stereo with a digital clock. There were four speakers (two front and two rear) and the sound was very clear and the digital tuner allowed us to pick up more radio stations than we normally get on our own car. 

There was a full overhead console that included a conversation mirror, coin holder, sunglasses holder, garage door opener holder, and  reading/dome lamps. There is also a floor console where you could put your map, baseball tickets, etc. in it. The exterior color of the minivan was white with a clear coat paint. The interior colors were a soft gray seats and carpets. There was even a black roof rack on top of the minivan which we did not use.

Since we got trapped in a very heavy thunderstorm, the two speed windshield wipers with interval features worked very well. There was also a rear window defroster. The minivan has four-wheel ABS front disc rear drum braking system. 

We really did enjoy renting this 2001 Fort Windstar Minivan and if we were looking for a new vehicle, I think this one would be at the top of our list. I did not mark the box for recommending this van, so I just edited my review. I definitely recommend this van. Thank you.
