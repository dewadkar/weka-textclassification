            I purchased my 2000 Ford Mustang GT roughly 9 months ago, therefore I feel I have had plently of time to really get to know this car. Here's everything you should know about the car before you make your purchase complete.

1. Traction Control
Well, this is a great idea, and if your purchasing the V8, you had better get this option, but don't always rely on it. I think of it as more of a tire-saver mode. This will help your if your foot becomes a little trigger-happy around a corner when it is wet out, but at the first hint of snow, head for the garage! Mustangs have never been knows as good winter handlers, and the 2000 model is no exception, even with the optional traction control. Don't become overconfident just because you have this option.

2. Mach 460 Sound System
Certainly 460 Watts of power and 8 speakers sounds like a great system, but I feel it depends what your listening pleasure is. For example, if your enjoy country or top 40 music, this system will be sure to please. It hits the highs and mids accurately and crisply, and even adds quite a bit more lows than the factory system. On the other hand, if you enjoy alternative or a little more of the harder stuff, your still going to need to fill the trunk with speakers in order to receive the &quot;thump-thump&quot; as your drive down the road. 

3. Headlights
One thing is for certain in the Mustang, the headlamps are BRIGHT. I have found that no matter where I go, someone in the oncoming lane will assume that I have my high-beams on and attempt to burn out my retinas with his/her high beams in attempt to gain revenge. I have found this to be true even with the fog lamps turned off. I don't see it as a mjor problem, but it is something I doubt the dealer will mention, or even be aware of the problem.

4. Power
Oh yeah, there's plenty of it, and that's why you want one, right? The 2000 Mustang will provide all the power for which you are looking. As stated earlier, I've been driving mine for 9 months, and I still enjoy pressing the pedal and being pushed back into my seat. If 260 HP and a 14.0 second quarter-mile isn't fast enough, there are many power adders available at your local Mustang magazine. Many of these are easy bolt-ons. I suggest the K &amp; N Off-Road Filercharger kit or any power-adder ship. 

5. Interior
Functional... Except for trying to reach the CD controls with the shifter in the way. The interior will not overly impress anyone, but it will not appear cheap either. I feel it is in need of a make-over.

6. Exterior
Tough to wax, but boy does it shine up nice! I feel few cars can turn more heads than a freshly detailed Mustang. You'll love spending a free afternoon shining it up. I have found that it does rain more since I bought mine... But I can't blame the Mustang on that.<br><br>
