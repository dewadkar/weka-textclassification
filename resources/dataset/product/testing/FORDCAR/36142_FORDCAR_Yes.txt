            	With three children, one of them in an infant seat, we were originally looking for a used van to purchase when my husband stumbled upon a Ford Focus Wagon.  I immediately said &quot;No way am I driving a station wagon, I'm not even thirty years old yet!&quot;  After looking at too many high priced, high miles, used vans, I reluctantly went and looked at the Focus Wagon.  My initial reaction was, &quot;Well, that's different&quot;, upon second glance I loved it!  By nightfall, it was mine and now my husband has trouble getting me to let him drive it!

	When I fist told my sisters I got a wagon, their reaction was less than enthusiastic.  As soon as they saw it they changed their minds.  They said it looked more like a &quot;Mini-SUV&quot;.

	I love driving my wagon.  I don't feel so much a &quot;Family Car Mom&quot; in it because it is sporty. Sure I still listen to those Disney songs because upon finding out that our new car had a CD player, the kids immediately made me buy them a CD. But when they're not with me I crank the music and feel like I'm 18 again (with a better/sportier car).
  
	It's runs so quiet, that sometimes I'm not sure it is running at all and drives over city streets very smoothly.  My oldest daughter even does her homework while riding home from school.

	One of the things I like most about my wagon is it's safety features.  With three kids, it is hard to keep them sitting down while I'm driving.  The seatbelts are comfortable for them, so they will actually wear them (that's a first).  They also lock, which is great for the baby seat.  My wagon also automatically locks all of the doors in case I forget.  The back seats have child locks, so I don't have to worry about my (extremely active) four-year-old tumbling out of the car while driving, a definite plus!

	I would definitely recommend this car to any one with three or less small children (under 10-years-old), who don't have the resources for a $30,000 van. The back seat is just right for two adults or three children. This car was priced just right for us, and so far I have not found anything that I don't like about it, except when my husband drives it!
