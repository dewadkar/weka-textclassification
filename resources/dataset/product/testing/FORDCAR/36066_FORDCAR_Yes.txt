            <b>Putting it in Perspective</b>
Your standard American sedan (i.e. Ford Taurus, Toyota Camry, etc.) in Europe is a <b>HUGE</b> car - no kidding.  Gas prices are so high there that most people drive smaller, more fuel economic cars; which in turn create an extremely competitive market for this class of automobile.

So much that Ford has a completely separate division in Europe, that designs cars especially for its market (there aren't any Contours in Europe).  It was this division that mostly conceived and designed the Focus, and appropriately so.

Frankly, American designers simply cannot design a successful compact car -- GM's &quot;Geo&quot; line was a complete disaster, and the &quot;Escort&quot; name was taking the perception of the &quot;Pinto.&quot;  But having a small, affordable car with an affordable price tag is extremely lucrative to car manufacturers (ask Honda, they have the Civic line).

My point is that when Ford decided to be serious about this class of automobile, they didn't fool around and went straight the the professionals -- the European division's designers.

<b>Exterior</b>
Let's face it: the exterior styling is cool!  Compare this to the Focus' replacement, the Escort.  Or consider bland styling of the Sentra, Corolla, Neon, Sephia and Civic.  Sleek lines, sporty look and european flair make this a very good looking car on the road.

<b>Interior</b>
Roomy, spacious and inviting, the Focus' interior makes very efficient use of the overall car area.  The dashboard has curving lines and well-placed controls not found in other cars in it's class.  Seating areas are moderately comfortable, with a surprising amount of room in the front and rear seats.  As nice as it is, though, I couldn't imagine sitting more than 3 hours in this car; but my little sister, who owns this car, is young enough to live in it.

<b>Engine, Powertrain</b>
Well, what do you expect for 13-15k?  It's got a peppy 130hp engine that is quick enough for a little excitement, but not really fast enough to grab attention of the local law enforcement agencies.  I think Ford might benefit from having a turbo-edition in the lineup, just to make this car a little more exciting on the gas pedal.

On the inside, the engine is a bit loud; but since most of these kids put ear-deafening mufflers on their cars, or listen to music at a bone-rattling volume, this really isn't a problem.

<b>Ride</b>
I found the Focus to be surprisingly nimble around the corners.  The ZX3 is especially sporty, with 15&quot; wheels and 130hp standard.  The point, really, is to look cool, not be comfortable over bumps.  If you want comfort, check out my review on the Cadillac Seville.

<b>Overall</b>
Overall, I think the Focus is a great deal for the money you're paying.  Given it's great styling inside and out, I'm pleasantly surprised that Ford designed this.  It's no surprise, of course, that it's concept came from Europe.  Perhaps my biggest beef is the power- put a turbo on that thing!

Note: I don't own this car, my little sister does.  I drive it when she's not looking :p<br><br>
