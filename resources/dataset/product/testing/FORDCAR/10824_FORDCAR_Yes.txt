            After being totally fed up with our 1998 Chevy Lumina, we decided it was time for a change.  We knew we needed a minivan because we have two small children.  We looked at several different vans.  We liked the Ford Windstar the best.  We bought a 1998 Windstar.  We have only had it about 3 months now and so far we LOVE it.

We have so much more room than we ever dreamed of having.  It is so much easier to get two children in with two car seats.  I love having the extra seat in the back.  We don't have to take two vehicles whenever someone wants to go with us.  

Speaking of room, I love the fact that both back seats lay down flat or can be removed totally.  This makes it so easy to haul just about anything you need to.  My husband loves the leg room in the front passenger seat.

I was surprised to see how well the Windstar drives.  I figured it would be rough riding compared to the Lumina.  It is remarkably smooth riding and easy to drive.  It took me a while to get use to the size, but I have adjusted well and find it very easy to handle now.

If you have small children, I would definitely recommend this minivan to you.  It is so much more convenient than a car.  I never thought I would get my husband to buy a minivan, but he just loves this one now.  I am so glad we made this choice.  Definitely check this one out if you are in the market for a new vehicle.     <br><br>
