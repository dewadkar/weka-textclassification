            I have a 1997 Ford Contour Sport 4 cylinder. I bought it because it was under $20,000.00 and it looks good. It has a nice body style and good interior style. I like my car very much. It gets awesome gas mileage, and has pretty good pick up.
 The only thing that I do not like about my car is the air conditioning system. It stays cold as long as the car is moving. But when you slow down or stop it gets warm. Other than that the car is awesome.
 This car would be great for first time drivers. Because its small and safe. The car only has four cylinders, so its not a hot rod. But it gets you from point a to point b safely. The Contour handles great.

 All in all I would say this is a great little car that's inexpensive but looks and drives great. People who are looking for a hot rod should not get this car. They should look into getting a Contour SVT. This is the third ford product that I have owned and I have never had any major problems with it. Mechanically or otherwise. I owned a Chevy product and that thing lived at the dealership!!! Its a nice change of pace to go into the dealership and not know the service people like they are your best friends.<br><br>
