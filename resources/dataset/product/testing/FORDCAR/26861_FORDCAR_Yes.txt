            I bought this vehicle because it offered many items that a regular SUV did not. We bought the 1999 version with the Fontana Package. We got a T.V., CD player, and a VCR. If you plan to take a trip and you have children this is the SUV for you. My children hooked up their game system and played for hours on down the road. When it became night time when put a movie in and off to sleep they went. The gas mileage is not great but the comfort and extra little things make up for it. I would suggest that they find some way to make the jump seat stay up when you fold it up to put large items in it but other than that I would suggest that you buy this SUV. The SUV handles very nicely and handles great in snow. This car is for a family who has 4-6 members.
