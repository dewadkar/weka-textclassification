              After having purchased a Jeep Cherokee 8 months earlier i had finally had it . I wanted something new ,something that didn't sound like a bucket of bolts .
  I knew I wanted a SUV .I will never drive a car again. The first thing I looked at was a Chevy Blazer . Fortunately ,the seats just didn't fit my husband. I say fortunately because I never would have looked at the Ford Explorer had i bought the Blazer.  That would have been a major mistake.
   I love my new Explorer . I first looked at the 2001 two door model . I liked the looks of this model.  On a whim i decided to look at the four door model and lo and behold i fell in love. This vehicle felt so big and roomy i really couldn't believe it.  I purchased the XLS model ,not the fanciest model but this Explorer has every needed convience accessory . Power windows and locks,tilt wheel ,adjustable seating ,am-fm radio CD player with 6 speakers,intermittent wipers ,front and rear and of course cup holders ,front and back.
   The safety features such as 4 wheel ABS brakes,side supports,daytime running lights  and air bags are a definate plus also.
  This vehicle will be large enough for our family of five plus all the sports equipment needed at the time . A can fit 2 weeks of groceries in the back easily .The back window is able to be opened for tossing in of small items or the whole back door lifted up for maximum entry .
   In my opinion ,this is a definate asset to any family with active kids . A must for your list when out looking for that new SUV.
   The cost of the 4 door Explorer XLS stickered at 27,000 but I  was able to pick it up for about 23,000. A considerable savings for a family on a budget.<br><br>
