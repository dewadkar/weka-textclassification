            After looking at the price of new pick-ups I was left with the task of picking a used one out of the crowd.  I looked and drove basically all types and sizes of extended cab pick-ups.  The one I ended up with was a 1997 Ford F-150 X-cab 4x4.  This really surprised me due to the fact that I have always been a stereo typed &quot;Ford Hater&quot;  I based my decision the following criteria:
1.  Initial impression (looks)
2.  Driveability
3.  Power (the old &quot;seat of the pants feel test&quot;
4.  Overall quality (fit and finish)
5.  Value to dollar (Is it really worth that to me?)
6.  Back seat room, The best quick test is to sit in the front passenger  seat and move that seat as far forward as possible.  Then attempt to get in the back seat.  Noticing how easy or hard this task is.  After sitting down, ask yourself is it comfortable?  I found this model of Ford to offer the right combination of entry, leg room, and rear seat height.

I have been very impressed with the truck having owned it for over a year now.  I consider the engine to be in the small class as it is a 4.6 liter V-8; however, it certainly feels bigger than that.  Next would come economy, not bad at all for a full size 4 by.  Towing is accomplished very well with decent decrease in fuel economy.  Looks are the icing for this one.  It certainly has gained me more comments than any other truck that I've owned.<br><br>
