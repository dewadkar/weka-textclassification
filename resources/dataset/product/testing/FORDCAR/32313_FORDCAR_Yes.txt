            A true student of T-Bird history understands that this car while originally released to compete with Chevy's Corvette in the marketplace, was never intended to compete with the Corvette on the race track. The end result is an upscale sports car, that makes up for it's lack of spine jarring performance with good looks, ambiance and comfort, appealing to a more adult and mature class of achievers who still like the wind in their hair.

Make no mistake either, the car is no slouch. With the 3.9 litre V-8 pumping out over 250 ponies and a 0-60 time of 7 seconds, (92 mph in the 1/4 mi. trap) this is right up there with the performance specs of the old 90's Mustang 5.0 GT. The difference is that the ride is so much more refined, it doesn't FEEL like a stiff kiddies' hot rod.

The quality of the interior while spartan in design is unmistakably solid. My fiancee laments the lack of "bells and whistles" (isn't 2 zoned climate control a "whistle"?)but the purist will appreciate the touring roadster design. 

My desire for total independence does lead me to lament the fact that the 84 pound hard shell top MUST be removed by two people. Because of the weight and ungainly shape of the top there is no way to ensure trouble free removal and storage on the included rack unless 2 people are handling it. Perhaps I should renew my old Bally's membership?

Finally, this car is so striking, so gor-ge-ous, that everybody wants to check it out. One kid who was staring at it while riding his bike, almost got himself killed not paying attention to where he was going. (Would I get sued for the liability of distracting him I wonder?)I have had cars and trucks chase me down on the Interstate so that the drivers and passengers could get a better look. Perhaps Ford ought to produce a few more so that people get used to them and stop chasing me and tailgating? NAWWWW!
