            The new 2000 Focus is a great, fun driving, and stylish car.  There are a lot of things I love about this car.  Awesome interior and exterior design, very comfortable, the automatic transmission shifts very smoothly, it handles great and you feel like you are riding on glass.  There are also some bad things but not many.  There is a bit more road noise than a bigger car, steering is a bit stiff, and is under powered slightly for my taste but it will still get up and go!  I would recommend this car for first time buyers, teenagers (get the SE sport group for the teens), or a small family with two kids,  but you will eventually run out of room with a family (get a Taurus).  Great commuter car.  I have the Focus SE with the sport group and comfort group, and I could not be anymore pleased with the car. Ford has done a good job on standard equipment, especially the security features, you get keyless entry and the microchip ignition key standard with the Focus.  It also has a huge trunk and the rear seats lay flat for those big loads.  If you are one of those people that have to have a moon roof, it is not optional, wait a while and it will eventually become and option probably the next model year. I have still not gotten over the hypnotic smell of the car, it made my friends get the &quot;new car fever.&quot;  I live in GA and the car has not caught on yet but I have seen a few, this car will be a top seller once everybody knows about the car. Has a neat antenna too!
Great job Ford, wonderful car!<br><br>
