            After having our second child, my wife announced that she thought our ful-size sedan was too small and we needed to get a van.  Of course, it had to happen sometime but it was still a difficult transition.  

If you need a minivan, this could be the one for you.  We compared it to several other vans on the market and determined that it was the one for us.  It compares very favorably to the Toyota Sienna in safety (both are 4 star in crash tests) but for much less money in the used car market.  It is a little more expensive than the GM vans (we tried the Montana) but it is more comfortable and the engine appears to have more power.  Also, you have to like any vehicle with sensors that tell you when a bulb in your brake lights is burnt out (although I had to look up what that warning light meant and it did worry me until I figured it out)

Our package was the LX with:
2 sliding doors
roof rack
4 captains chairs (much better than a middle bench seat)
3.6 liter engine
CD/Cassette
Lighted entry

I still like driving our Intrepid or Wrangler better but for the functionality you can't beat it.  The only draw back is that the rear seat folds down or removes but doesn't "tumble" forward like the Sienna or Montana.  This featur allows for more cargo room without the hassle of removing the seat.  Also, a split rear bench with independent folding would be good.
