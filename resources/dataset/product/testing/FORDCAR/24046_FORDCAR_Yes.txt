            Seriously, I didn't plan to buy a Ford Expedition. I had in mind to buy an Explorer, having owned 2 Mercedes Benz, 1 Fiat and a Toyota in the past. While at the Ford dealers shop examining the Explorer models, I notice a giant to my right. It was the Expedition - huge but beautiful. I asked to test drive and my mind was made. My wife thought it was too huge, but now she loves being driven in it.

Mine is a 4.6L V8 Expedition rugged and built for all season. Oh, I love the space - Save for the furniture, we didn't need a mover when we moved to our new home! Two trips and that was it. The Expedition is an interesting balance of luxury and utility. And when you go camping, it's like taking a hotel with you. Collapsing the rear seat gives you a bedroom! The rear seats form perfectly like a pillow in the collapsed position. You'll also love the quality of the music. No wonder it is called an Expedition. Or you can setup a mobile office in the Expedition equipped with connections for your TV, laptop, and other gadgets.

Three things I hate about the Expedition: 1)no economy on gas, but what with its size and facilities. 2) I cannot push a button to bring the antenna down so it doesn't scratch the roof of my underground garage. The antenna is flexible though and yields easily, so it cannot break. 3)It needs extra care with parking in my kind of garage. Now I know why they put that much creativity in the mirrors. But I tell you, don't settle on a truck until you try the Expedition.
