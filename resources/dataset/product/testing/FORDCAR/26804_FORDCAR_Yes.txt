            My last three vehicles have been leased, all have been Ford products.  I started out with a '95 Mustang.  After having our baby we decided we needed a larger vehicle and went with the '97 Explorer.  The lease expired, we when in to purchase it and found out we could get a '99 Expedition for a smaller payment, of course we went for it!

We love our Expedition and will turn this lease into a purchase, no need to upgrade to a Excursion.  We decided on this vehicle because we were planning on expanding our family a few more times, with a child and a very large dog (a Newfoundland).  We already have one toddler and a 100 pound yellow lab and there is still room for more.

Our Expedition is the 4WD XLT Model, sure we would have loved the Bauer Edition, but the extra's were not enough to convince us to pay almost $6000 more.  The seating is very comfortable in both the front and back with lots of leg room, almost too much!!  I would have shortened the leg room in the back seat and made a little more room in the third seat area. That would be my only complaint about the Expedition, but the again what are &quot;Thule&quot; racks for?  We comfortably took 2 adults, 4 children (one in a car seat) our dog, and luggage for all on a long trip and everyone was comfortable.
