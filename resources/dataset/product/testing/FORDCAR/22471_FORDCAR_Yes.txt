            I own investment real estate, and needed a p/u truck to carry building materials, and supplies etc. I purchased a Ford Ranger 1999 model brand new. It had a whopping 2 miles on it.

I selected this because it is small, as I am. I can't see over a full sized truck. It has automatic transmission. This was the second absolute in my list of criteria. It has an air conditioner. BINGO! Everything else was a non issue.

The vehicle has a V-6 engine. But it is a small V-6, and at times I find it difficult to get it going. It is not built for speed, nor &quot;jackrabbit&quot; off the line from stop. When loaded with heavy items it does a good job. But again, I must say that I'm somewhat disappointed with power. It tends to &quot;dog&quot;, and gas mileage could be better.

Over all, I guess I did ok. But I think I'll find a different truck next time.

Thats all for now. Cheers!<br><br>
