            This epinion is for my girlfriend's 1993 Red Ford Tempo.  Rest assured, I have driven it on several occasions, so I am qualified to be the author of this epinion.

She purchased her Tempo just a few months ago at an area dealer for around $5000.  You may think that that's a bit too much for such an old car, but check out the odometer: 39,000!  It's not every day that you find a five year old car with fewer than 40,000 miles on it.  Yes, it was a &quot;Gramma&quot; car, formerly owned by an old lady who more or less used the vehicle to travel back and forth from church and the local grocery, and not much more than that.

The car is decently designed (This only applies to the 4-door models.  Any 2-door Tempo that you see you must blow up immediately--they're just that ugly!  Keep America beautiful.), without a lot of that metal molding that cars of that period seem to have.  You can tell that the car was designed inbetween the &quot;boxy&quot; era of the 80s and the sophisticated, streamlined design of the cars produced in the mid-to late-90s and today.

Inside, the car is not built for tall people.  At 6 feet even (with no shoes, natch!), my knees are pretty close to the dashboard with the seat all the way back.  The backseat isn't any better with the leg room severely cramped for adults.  So I guess this would be the perfect car for short parents with little kids...

Mechanically, the car isn't bad.  Equipped with a (surprisingly) speedy 4-cylinder, the car handles quite well, with good steering, manuverabilitiy, handling, as well as how it rides.  Problems ensue however, with the paltry 85 mph top speed and while acceleration is quick at first, it takes quite a bit more when you crest 35 mph.

It's a bit too soon to tell how the reliability will be, however, there is a knocking noise somewhere on the driver's side that may become a larger problem if not looked into soon.

Other issues: For a car its size, the miles per gallon is not what it should be, somewhere around 22 miles per gallon.  The car should get at least 24.  Trunk space is not very large, though at least two corpses would fit comfortably.

In the end, the Ford Tempo is an average car.  While it could stand to be slightly more roomier, get better gas mileage, and have better acceleration, there are far worse cars out there, some even newer than this one.
