            This year I decided to change jobs and needed to trim down the bills. The best thing to happen to me was trading in my sports car with the high payments for a 1999 Ford Ranger. This 3.0L engine automatic is such a pleasure to drive. My payments are HALF of what they used to be! That alone makes it the deal of the century to me. My Ford salesman picked out this truck specially for me. It is an autumn orange flare-side with CD player and as I mentioned, very low payments. This truck has come in handy plenty of times moving large items like fencing, pallets, bales of hay and musical equipment. Living in Texas and being a musician, it just makes sense to drive a truck and this Ford Ranger is compact enough but strong enough to get the job done and still enjoy driving the highways. I recommend this product to everyone. The cab has plenty of room with 2 fold down seats in the back for extra passengers or kids while leaving plenty of room up front. My Ranger has a console that holds CD's or tape's and can be put in the upright position for extra seat room. It is a comfortable ride and has been a very low maintenance vehicle. Surprisingly, I get just as many favorable comments about this vehicle as
I did on the sports car. People just love trucks and
having the confidence to move just about anything is a great feeling. This is my first automatic transmission since 1967 and as much as I enjoy the control of a five speed it has been nice to just relax and cruise the road. Try one out, if you drive a &quot;fast&quot; car like I used to the feeling of sitting higher in the seat will be a nice change, if nothing else.<br><br>
