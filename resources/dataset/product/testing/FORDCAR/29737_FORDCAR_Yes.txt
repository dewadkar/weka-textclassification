            I am a tad two sided on the Ford Explorer. I guess that you can say that I really do enjoy it but there was room for improvement with this model. The good far outweigh the bad. I hope that this review is helpful to you if you are considering purchasing one. 

A little more about my Explorer 

My particular truck is a 1997 Ford Explorer Sport. It is a V6 SOHC automatic 4x4. It is fully loaded. The Explorer is a strong running vehicle. It has never failed to get me where I needed to go. The ease of handling on the road combined with roomy interior were the two strongest selling points for me. Little did I know I would be having another child and a 4 seater would not work for our family much longer. 

I have had a few minor repairs that have needed to be done to my Explorer, a thermostat and suspension problems. I just learned today that my vehicle is under recall for this problem now so I will be calling them soon to get my $50.00 deductible back. Last is that I had to remove my running boards after only a year and a half. They became very rusty. It is beyond me how this happened, I have had no problems what so ever will the body itself. 

Haven driven many SUVs I will say that the Explorer Sport handles much differently. I found that cornering was somewhat clumsy compared to others. Other then that the Explorer handles extremely well. I love the fact that it can automatically be set on auto 4WD. This is very useful to me living in Michigan with constantly changing driving conditions. Breaking seems to be above average as well for an SUV.

As mentioned above the Sport version only seats 4. However I will say VERY comfortably. The lumbar seating is especially nice for longer trips. The rear air and radio also has been great for our growing family. No need to worry about you being hot and the kids being cold. 

As most of you know SUVs do not get the greatest gas mileage. To be completely honest I am not exactly sure how much mine gets. I would estimate 17-20 MPG. I knew this going into purchasing my Explorer and is a very important factor.

I would recommend the 1997 Explorer Sport to others as long as that is what would suit their needs. The Explorer Sport is a fun but bumpy ride and should not be considered as an alternative for a mini van. I am learning this now as I just sadly put mine up for sale because our family is out growing this 4 seater with me expecting baby number 3. Fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride! <br><br>
