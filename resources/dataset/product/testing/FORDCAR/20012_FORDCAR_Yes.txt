            when I turned 16 my mom bought a 1986 ford ranger super cab (4 wheel drive, automatic) off of a guy she worked with for $1,000. turns out when we got it, it needed new break lining (but that didn't shock us, we did only pay $1,000 for it!). since I didn't have my license yet, we had another vehicle to drive, and we didn't have the money to get it fixed, we parked it in our bottom driveway until we got the money & I had gotten my license and needed it for school. BIG MISTAKE! the poor truck was sitting down there for 2 yrs! (I'm 18 now) anyway, we had the break lining fixed and got it on the road. after sitting for 2 yrs and not running, little things here and there would go and needed to be fixed (relay, fuel filter, air filter, you know, the simple little things). other than that my truck has been great. I'm a college student at a community college and last semester my truck would travel around 80 miles a day for 5 days a week. this semester it goes 80 miles a day for 3 days a week. I've been caught in snow storms, freezing rain ~ the worst, and I am so happy I had that truck. it's the best. 

the only problems I have is the rust on the body (I'm afraid to take it to a car wash in fear the 1/2 the body will be left behind!), the gas mileage isn't to great, the windows will actually get frost on the inside on extremely cold days after I get in it (from my body heat & breath), and because it's so old and I drive it so much, it's about ready to retire (it's in the shop right now, I'm looking to get a cheap car so I can save my truck for short trips and bad weather). plus I noticed that in cold weather it has a problem starting. 

but if I could keep that truck on the road forever I would. I love it, and the only reason that I would ever get rid of it is if it was completely dead. even though my friends have teased me for driving it (I guess it is quite funny watching an 18yrs old teenage girl drive a rusty old ford ranger!). but that's ok b/c my truck does better in bad weather than any of their cars do, plus it'll even go 70mph .... I don't think that's too bad! 

over all I think we've paid around $2,500 for the truck, between the cost of the truck and parts.
