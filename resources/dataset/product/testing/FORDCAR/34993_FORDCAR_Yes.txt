            My wife bought our 1990 probe GT new.  it was purchased to replace an alfa romeo undergoing a rebuild. It still shares the garage with the alfa.  As of 2000 it has 285000 miles of daily use. The big good points are the looks the handling and the performance( the spouse has two tickets for 85+). When new a superchips performance chip and water injection were added which greatly increased the performance. Repairs have been nothing out of the ordinary other than an exhaust system every two years no matter who you buy from. The clutch was replaced at 200000 miles. New electronic shocks and Eibach springs were installed at 180000 miles.A power window motor and a seatbelt drive were replaced under warranty. It did hit a deer which required thr replacement of the nose, rad, front fenders pop up headlights and drivers door 4 years ago  ( big Deer).The car is a wonderful long distance cruiser that we have no concerns about getting into and driving all day in. There has been nothing produced since 93 that has the combination of looks price and performance. Avengers and cougars are to slow and flabby. camaros and firebirds to big and unwieldly<br><br>
