            We love this truck.  This is a truck built for hauling.  It also does double-duty as the primary family vehicle.  

It has a V8 Powerstroke Diesel engine that provides plenty of horsepower for pulling, without losing any &quot;get-up-and-go&quot;.  The engine noise is louder than a conventional gas engine, especially with the windows down, but is quieter than a Chevy or Dodge diesel.  The mileage is pretty good for a vehicle this size.  I can go about 600 miles on a tank of fuel before the &quot;Low Fuel&quot; light goes on.  It has a large fuel tank and diesel fuel is running about the same price as a medium-grade gas ($1.39/gal here in Texas).  A manual transmission is a must for hauling anything.  Although the gear shift was a little hard to get used to because they put Reverse on the left instead of the right.

We chose the XLT package instead of the Eddie Bauer because with 4 kids and 3 dogs, leather seats just wouldn't make it.  It does have power windows, power mirrors and lumbar support in the front seats.  The quad doors are also nice.  Makes unloading kids much easier.  

The only design flaw that I find is the cup holder and ashtray.  The ashtray is directly under the cup holder, making access difficult.  The cup-holder is also not sized right to hold a coffee cup.  I always have spilt coffee on the floorboard.  I do like the plug-in port for a cell phone.  Since we have 2 phones, one gets plugged in there, the other in the cigarette lighter.
