            I recently purchased an off lease 1997 Expedition Eddie Bauer. Comfortably seats eight, although the third row of three would be best if used for the kids. Look for the 5.4 liter engine. With a vehicle this heavy, you need all the horses you can muster, and the standard 4.8 liter seems lethargic when merging or going up inclines. I can only imagine trying to tow up a hill. Four full size doors, Rear controls for both the stereo and heat/air are useful on long trips. 6 disc CD changer works well, and the MACH stereo package sounds great. The family fits comfortably inside, as do the relatives. All at the same time too. Variable response steering works very well at low speeds, although highway driving takes a little getting comfortable to, especially if your coming from a sport sedan into this truck. Ride is somewhat stiff, but for a truck, better then most others I've driven. The biggest con; Fuel economy. OK, Economy should not be used in the same sentence. I average 13 mpg, and that is with over 75% highway mileage. Drop into 4 wheel drive and watch the needle move. Great little party game. I highly recommend one of those % back Gas company credit cards. Anything to dull the blow of $32.00 fill ups. Who is this GOOD for? Large people, large families, boat owners, people with companies to pay their gas charges. If you are happy with your Civic HV, Go away. Your car could easily stow in the back, thanks to the nice fold down seats. <br><br>
