            We�ve had our Ford Expedition for six months now and we still think it�s great. Ours is the 1999 Eddie Bauer version with 2WD, towing package and the big Triton V-8 engine. Mostly we use it for general driving around town and taking the kids to school, and with six kids in the carpool it�s good to have all those seats. It is great for city driving, but it does use up more gas than many other vehicles on the road. And you have to admit that there are times when parking is going to be a challenge. It�s a big vehicle, and doesn�t fit into those �compact� parking spots at all.

Despite its mammoth proportions, the Expedition is remarkably easy to drive and even pretty easy to park. In fact, it actually fits in the garage, which is more than you can say for some other big SUVs. My wife loves it, especially since we got the optional adjustable foot pedals. It could be the perfect family car: it has the ability to haul the kids like a mini-van or station wagon, but you can still look cool while driving it! 

We bought the car because we have a large family and also have occasional need for hauling. The Eddie Bauer version comes with leather seats for eight, which makes for a great carpool vehicle. As for towing, we used the Expedition to pull a trailer from Southern California to Arizona and you almost couldn�t tell it was pulling a load, even when going up some pretty serious mountain slopes. That Triton V-8 puts out 300 HP, which is plenty of power for about anything that�s going to come up. 

We love so many things about this vehicle, but I have to mention: adjustable foot pedals (they sound silly if you never had them, but make much more sense than moving the seats!), the six-CD player in the front console, leather seats, the large number of seats, the manuevering(very tight turning radius!), and the sheer power! 

There�s really nothing to hate, but things that I don�t like are the front passenger air-bags that prevent me from letting kids ride up front (I can�t imagine an accident that is going to crush in the front of something as big as this, and there is a lot of room up there to be crunched), the low gas mileage, and of course the difficulty parking (forget about compact spots. I�ve noticed many SUV owners get around the parking issue by just taking two spots, and I suppose you can rationalize that you paid two times as much as most compact cars so you sort of deserve two spots). A bigger selection of colors would have been nice. We got a blue one, and it�s nice, but we really wanted a somewhat lighter color blue. Ford only offers six colors on the Eddie Bauer. Hey, there�s eight of these vehicles on my street! We need more colors.

Driving this vehicle is actually even better than I thought it would be. You can�t beat it for visibility, as it sits higher than just about anything with two axles. While it�s big, it is remarkably nimble. It can really turn on a dime, in fact, it turns in a smaller radius than my mini-van and is much better than my old Ford truck. The downside to this easy turning and sitting so high is that it feels like it has a tendency to understeer. This is most noticeable at high speeds, and as a result I just don�t like to drive it much faster than 90 mph, even though it is barely getting going at that point. This isn�t really much of a limitation as there aren�t that many places you can drive faster than that. On long cruises such as you can only find in the vast western states, you will find many places where you will only be limited by how fast you feel like driving. Gas mileage really doesn�t change much under different driving conditions. We get about 13 mpg driving around town, got about the same mileage on the highway with 5000 lb in tow, and get about 14.5 under the optimum highway conditions with flat straight roads and little traffic. The gas tank is huge, so you�ll get about 400 miles
between fill-ups.

I�d recommend this  vehicle to anyone who needs a good family car. I�ve had no problems with it at all, it seems very solid and well built. I haven�t even heard any rumors of problems with these cars. If you want good mileage or have trouble parking this is not the car for you, but for most people this is a great looking people mover that�s fun to drive,
looks great, and will last for years. It�s not cheap, but depending on your needs the entry level models aren�t that expensive. If you want the luxury ride, definitely go for the Eddie Bauer version, it�s got everything you�ll ever need. We compared many other SUVs, including the Chevy Suburban, the Cadillac, the Mercedes, both Lexus models, the
Jeep Cherokee, and the Lincoln Navigator, as well as a lot of mini-vans. I think the Expedition is definitely the best value of the bunch. Most of the people I know agree. It�s bigger and more powerful than most of the other SUVs, but still fits in a standard sized garage. It costs more than some vehicles, but a lot less than the MB, Lexus, or Lincoln. (Those fancy walnut steering wheels just burn your hands, anyway.) <br><br>
