            I love Fords and was ready for a sports car.  It is a sporty car and gets decent gas mileage (16 in town, 27 on highway).  I never had any problems with the car.

It is a smooth riding car and has plenty of room in the front for two people.  The back is comfortable for two adults short distances and for two children any distance.

The car really proved itself to me when I was hit head on by another car.  We were both travelling 55mph.  The passenger area held together well and both airbags deployed.  I was wearing a seatbelt and not seriously injured.  Although the car was considered totaled, it proved its worth to me when I was able to walk away from that wreck.  Most people don't think sports cars are safe, but the Mustang to me is.  I would not hesitate to recommend this car for anyone.

My car was an automatic with power door locks, power windows, dual airbags, keyless entry, and an alarm.  I never had problems with any of these features.  The only time I had the car in the garage was for normal oil changes.

It is definitely not a family car, but a nice safe car for a single person who wants a sporty looking car.  It is reliable and not an expensive car.  It is definitely lacking in room on the inside, but again, it is not a car you need to buy if you need lots of room.  I would recommend this to anyone.
