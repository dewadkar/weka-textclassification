            I bOUGHT THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE AT THE TIME I WAS DOING ALOT OF TRAVELING. I WANTED A CAR THAT LOOKED GOOD AND ALSO FELT GOOD.THE THUNDERBIRD LX IS VERY QUICK AND SPORTY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS ALSO PURE LUXURY.I LOVE THE WAY THE CAR FEELS ON THE OPEN HIGHWAY, WITH THE SUNROOF OPEN AND THE CD PLAYER ROCKIN. SO FAR I HAVE NOT FOUND ANYTHING I HATE ABOUT THIS CAR, EXCEPT THE BRAKES. I HAVE HAD THE FRONT ROTORS REPLACED 6 TIMES IN TWO YEARS, BUT FINALLY HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM.THIS VEHICLE IS RECOMMENDED FOR BOTH THE YOUNG ENTHUSIAST AND THE OLDER GENERATION THAT ENJOYS A WELL BUILT, LUXURIOUS BUILT AUTOMOBILE....<br><br>
