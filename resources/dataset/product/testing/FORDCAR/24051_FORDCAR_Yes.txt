            I bought this vehicle as a trade from a minivan, needing the seating capacity for a family.  I was amazed at how well the Expedition drove and how comfortable everyone was in it.  I love the fact that it drives and handles like a car but can go wherever it wants.  This vehicle is for the buyer that wants the luxury of a big SUV without taking out a second mortgage to get it.  This vehicle is easy to handle and with the 5.4L engine can get up and go.  The only caution is that it sits very high and ladies will need a running board to get up in the vehicle when they wear a dress or skirt.  The rear air and backseat radio control make all the difference in comfort during a long trip.  I recommend it to anyone who likes the room and comfort of a big vehicle without feeling like you are driving a bus.<br><br>
