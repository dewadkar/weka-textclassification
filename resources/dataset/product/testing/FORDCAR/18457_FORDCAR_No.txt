<TEXT>
            I bought a 1997 Ford Ranger to make a 6,500 mile trip from Alaska to the East Coast.  I had made the same trip two years before with an 1987 Chevy S10.  I got much worse gas mileage on a the Ford, which was 10 years newer.  Also, the Ford would not handle the same mountains that my S10 had no problems conquering.  I have not enjoyed my Ranger, because my Chevy ran and handled much better, and was 10 years older.  I will never buy a Ford again.  I recommend Chevy S10 for peace of mind on a long hard journey.<br><br>
