            Even though it is not the best car on the market, it is a nice car for those who like taking an adventure. Having the same characteristics as other sports utility vehicles, the '01 Ford Explorer comes with almost everything you need for a decent price, considering the alternatives. 

Some features included in my car were automatic windows and locks, power-steering, and automatic transmission for only $21,000.00. The only feature that I would have liked was cruise control, but it is not absolutely necessary for the college graduate. It is my second car and I like what I have bought. 

However, there are some things that I could go without. One thing that many people seem to mention that I have noticed is that doesn't have much space in the front seats.  I always feel cramped when trying to drive.  However, there is plenty of room in the back.  Great car for carrying stuff around.  It also is not too big for the occassional joy-ride.  

Overall, I think this car is a good car to buy new for those who need a car with storage space and plan to keep the car for a while.
