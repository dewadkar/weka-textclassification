            I recently purchased a Ford Explorer Sport - it came with all of the options except for leather and was brand new.  It handles great and has a strong and sturdy frame.  It takes off very well because it has a strong V-6 and is lighter than a normal SUV.  But, its lightness does not compromise its safety because unlike other smaller SUV's the Ford Explorer Sport rides more like a larger Explorer but still has the feel of a car.  It is lots of fun to drive.  People who are looking for a great value and a great car should get a Ford Explorer Sport.  I love mine - it's GREAT!<br><br>
