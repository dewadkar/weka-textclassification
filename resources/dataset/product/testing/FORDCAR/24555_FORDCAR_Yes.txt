            The 1997 Ford F-150, would I buy one I already have. In fact I recomended it to my brother and he bought one. I originally bought one because of its new stylings compaired to the rest of the market. It really is a sleek and beautiful truck. It is a powerful truck to match.
PROS- This truck is very powerful, fast and for the size is very easy to manouver around hazerdus situations (very responsive). Big and easy to use controls for the radio and the heat and ice cold air. Good room inside can easly fit 6. Good paint job. Exelent tranny. Many easy to use addons for the younger crowd such as headlight blackouts, bug deflectors, rain/sun blockers for windows, back racks and spoilers.
CONS- No left over power to pass after 115km/h. Very light in back 2 wheel drive bad in the snow (easy fix put sand bags or let snow pile up in back for extra weight). Poor quality origional tires, they don't last long at all. Rounded hood makes it hare to judge distances when parking.
Even with those few cons this is still a great truck. Fast exceleration by
any truck standards. Strong box and comes with a free box liner. I would reccomend this truck to anyone.<br><br>
