            I bought my automatic 91 Festiva in 1996 with 40,000 miles on it. I paid around $5000 for it.  It now has almost 120,000 miles on it. 

The car has a  lot of bad and good things about it. Let's start with the good.  It is a very reliable car.  I have only had $70 worth of repairs.  It was a drain plug that cost about $10, the rest were labor costs.  Compared to other cars, of course the interior is going to be a bit cramped, but if you compare the Festiva to a Geo Metro or a similar car, the interior is much roomier.  They're inexpensive to buy and cheap to maintain.

The major downside is that it is unsafe.  The exterior feels very flimsy.  Sometimes if the door is not shut all the way and I lean against it to shut it, it dents in.  If you were in a head-on accident with anything other than another Festiva, you would probably not make it out.  It also is not very visually appealing.  A lot of my friends refer to it as a roller skate.
  
Overall, this is probably a good car for a young person who needs a cheap reliable car to drive in town.  Not recommended for extended driving.
