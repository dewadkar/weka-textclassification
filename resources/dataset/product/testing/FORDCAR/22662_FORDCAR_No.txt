            ..It's a way of life.  My wife had always wanted a Mustang so last year we bought one of the first '99 Cobras off the truck.  Our Cobra is a rio red coupe with medium parchment interior.  I had some experiences with the Mustangs of the late '80s but there is no comparison.  This is a true sports car. The new IRS make the car handle like it is on rails.  What other car can you purchase for under $30k that has a hand built engine?  The SVT folks treat you right also.  The latest gift is a leather Jacket.  

The only negatives is the noise level inside the car.  This is to be expected with a true performance car but it gets old on road trips.
