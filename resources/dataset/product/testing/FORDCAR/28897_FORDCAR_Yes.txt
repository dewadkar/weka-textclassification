            I purchased a 2000 Ford Explorer about a month ago.  I have been a Chevy man since my first one which was 1949.  So i am now trying out a Ford?  Well i am glad I did.  This Explorer has automatic four wheel drive, automatic transmission and a host of options that I wouldn't dare to list.  It has a towing package, which I recommend even if you don't plan to tow anything, because it includes a transmission cooler, heavy duty suspension and a heavy duty electrical system.  The rack on top must be for looks, because it doesn't appear to be very useful.  However, with the seats folded down, there is plenty of room to put lots of stuff.

The electric seats are very comfortable and offer unlimited choices to the driver.  The four wheel anti skid brakes are a real safety feature.
I just drove on a 1,000 mile trip and averaged about 21 mpg.  Actually I thought that was a poor showing, but understand that is about what I can expect.The radio controls are, however, too small and hard to see while driving. The trip was very comfortable, and I am very pleased with this vehicle.  <br><br>
