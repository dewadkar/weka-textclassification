            My friend recently purchased a new 1999 Ford Mustang back in March and he loves it.  After riding in it numerous times I can't say that I love it but I can say that it does have it's advantages and disadvantages.  First of all, the car looks great in black with tan leather, I have to say that.  There are some things that bother me though.  The backseat is extremely cramped and virtually has no room.  The tires in rainy weather slip and slide all over the place and I'm not too fond of the new tail light design.  With the seats in a comforterable driving position, virtually no room is left in the back.  It's as though the car should not even have a backseat at all.  Though this bugs me, the car has excellent pickup and seems to be able to beat anyone of the line.  It gets an okay gas milage too, filling up the tank probable about once a week, if you don't drive with a lead foot.  I would only recommend this car to mustang lovers and people who like to live life in the fast lane.<br><br>
