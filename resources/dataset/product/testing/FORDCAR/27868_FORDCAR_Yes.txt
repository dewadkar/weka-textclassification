            The 2004 Expedition is a good evolution in the development of this model.  Having owned both a '98 and an '01 Expedition, I was looking forward to the redesigned done in 2003.  I waited a model year and, so far, I am pleased with the overall characteristics of my new 2004 Expedition Eddie Bauer.

The improvements I find most appealing over the previous models are many;  6 disk in-dash CD player (vs. a separate changer in the center console), streamlined controls with better quality feel, much better steering response and feel, better overall ride, optional rear-seat DVD system (with player integrated into the screen (the kids can control their viewing, with no player taking space up front!)), fold-flat 3rd row seats (a major improvement over the previous design (flat for trips, up once you get to your destination, unload your stuff, and need to haul people around)), great seats, and more comfort for 8 people.

I selected the 5.4L V8 (a must if you haul more than 2-4 people or tow things), power-fold third row seats (trick, but is power fold really necessary?), rear-seat DVD, and climate control front seats, and was able to get the price down to $33.5k and change, from a list price of $41.9k.  As this market segment has become more competitive, Ford has responded by improving the design of their product and by becoming more competitive on price (if you are paying list for this vehicle, you just aren't trying).

Early concerns I have for this vehicle are as follows;  the stock radio is Sirius satellite-ready.  However, you cannot use the satellite radio and the rear-seat DVD at the same time (I am waiting for Ford to release a fix before I make the jump into Sirius, as I do want to be able to use both at the same time).  There is also an inordinate amount of brake dust that builds up on the front wheels.  Ford is supposed to be preparing the release of a new type of pad to address this, due out in January.  I hope to see this issue disappear with the new pads.

Styling is subjective with any vehicle.  I looked at the Sequoia, Pathfinder Armada, Dodge, and GM offerings, and decided that the look of the Expedition is still right for me.

Overall, the 2004 meets my needs, is an improvement over previous models, and has the options I want to satisfy my wants.  Shop around for what will do the same for you, but include the Expedition on your shopping list.
