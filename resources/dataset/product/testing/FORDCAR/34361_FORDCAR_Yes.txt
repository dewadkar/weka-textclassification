                To be honest, when I first looked at the car I didn't like it that much, and there are still somethings I don't like about this car. But there are enough good things in this model that make up for the bad. In this opinion I hope to specifically point out the best points, the OK points, and the worst points of the car, starting with the worst.

    Recently I ran into a curb and had a flat tire. As usual I wasn't happy about, but it got worse. After I pulled over and got arround to the trunk I was happy to see the spare tire where it should be, but underneath was the worst jack I had ever seen in my life. It was tiny, about one foot in length, and I could not get my car up with it. I sat and tried a million different ways, but it would not work and I finally called the ford motor service I subscribed to. Watch out for getting stuck with no way to change your tire. This is truly the only bad thing about the car though.

   One thing that is OK, but I am not thrilled about is the hood. I am moderately tall (6'1&quot;) and I can not see the hood line when I sit in the drivers seat. This car was designed that way for safety, but I have found myself nearly running into people all the time because I can not accurately judge where I am.


    Now on to the good things about this car. As every one knows from the comercial the Taurus has good safety record. That was a main reason I bought this car. I feel very safe in it. I bought the SE which has a V6 in it, I am happy I did this because I use it a lot for getting on highways quickly and for getting into traffic. The SE is not a neccesity but if you like to do things quickly like I do you should get it because otherwise the car is very heavy and slower. The gas mileage on the car is OK. I find with the way I drive it is anywhere from 14-19 miles per gallon, which is far off from what I was told the car had. This is not great, but I don't drive too far and gas is cheap in Oklahoma. This is something you should take into consideration though. How much will you drive the car? If is tha answer is alot then you might want to think how much it will cost you in gas. 

   So overall this is a good car. I would recommend it to anyone. There are a few not so great things about it, but I am satisfied with it. It is reliable and safe. I think it is a good buy. (I also really like the remote trunk entry)<br><br>
