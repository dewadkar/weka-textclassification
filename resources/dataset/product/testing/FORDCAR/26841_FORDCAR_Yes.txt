            The 1999 Ford Expedition is a great car pool car!  It is an eight passenger car/truck.  It has two bucket seats in the front row and two bench seats in the rear. Access to the third seat is extremely easy my 8 year can do it herself.  The second seat flips down flat or folds forward for entry to the third or for storage.  The rear seat folds forward (the 2000 has a neat bar to hold the third seat in the upright position) or it can be removed.  My husband can do this by himself and he assures me that I could too.
There is enough room behind the seat for about 4 or 5 grocery bags which are easily placed in by just opening the window part of the back. When I do a major grocery trip I fold the middle seat flat and it works out great!
It has great visibility and steers like a car.  Before the Expedition I drove a 4x4 truck and had a tough time parking and making tight turns. Now I have no problems.
I do get teased a lot about its size but once I take them for a ride they agree that it is a fun car to be in! <br><br>
