            I have always owned Chevy's.  I have even owned 2 S-10 Blazers in the past.  That all changed when I saw my first Expedition!  We bought a 1999 over a year ago and we love it!  We have 2 kids so safety is a big consideration for us when buying a vehicle.  The Expedition is built solid.  I have a job that I must go to no matter the weather.  I have driven through 6 and more inches of snow with no problem at all.  In fact I hardly noticed the snow!
I was a little intimidated with the size when I first bought it but got used to it within a few days.  Now I love being the &quot;big&quot; truck on the road.
The Expedition is a great family car as it seats 8 very comfortably.
Now I am eyeing the Excursion for my next SUV!!!<br><br>
