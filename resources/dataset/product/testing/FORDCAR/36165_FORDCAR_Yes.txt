            The Escort is dead after 20 years of service.  Actually the Escort will hang around another year or two until the Focus takes off.

The Focus is Ford's latest entry into the &quot;most bang for little bucks&quot; category.  As cars in this category go, the Focus should be in the middle to top for most buyers.

The driving position is superb. Everything in easy sight and reach.  Seating is above average for this size of car front and back.

You have 2 engines to choose from the basic 4 banger and the Zetec sporty engine.  I was a little disapointed with the acceleration with the Zetec, but you can't have it all when your car is loaded for under 20 grand.

You have 3 body styles to choose from 2 door, 4 door and wagon. The styling is very new and might not be to everyone's liking.  The 2 door looks great to me from front or side, but the rear is pretty ugly.  

Ford is hitting the financing pretty hard for this model.  The current special is $200 a month for a decently equipped 4 door.

In short, look at one all over before you buy.  If you can handle the looks and power, the rest should be fine.
