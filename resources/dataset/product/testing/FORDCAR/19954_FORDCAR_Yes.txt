            I bought my 1987 Taurus wagon because I needed something cheap to get me through a Canadian winter (something that my Mustang 5.o could not do).  The car was 11 years old by then, so I hoped to squeeze a few months out of it. It has since plowed through 2 winters worth of snow &amp; ice (like a tank), making it well worth the initial $650 Canadian (GASP!) plus roughly $500 upkeep (tires, ball joints, exhaust, water pump, body fill, paint). If the body holds, the rolling living room takes on winter #3.
The car is amazingly roomy. I helped a relative move into her apartment in a nearby university town, taking a wicker love-seat &amp; chair, along with other various &amp; sundry items, all in the same trip. A non-stop, three-hour drive for 4 did not end at the chiropractor's, but rather in a night on the town. The car also brought 6 adults to a funeral without adding to their grief. When you get in &amp; close the door, I swear there's an echo!
Once inside, driving is pleasant, thanks to good visibility, decent handling and adequate acceleration. Fuel economy is surprising for a car this size (Hooray 3.0 engine &amp; O/D transmission!). Guaranteed, the car is not a road-rocket built for intense cornering, but it is not like a pig on roller skates, either.
Mechanically, the car has behaved better than all but one of my previous daily drivers (a Mitsubishi). I find this amazing as the car has just under 300 000 km showing on the odometer, plus some &quot;mystery miles&quot; the previous owner racked up driving the car from Alaska to New Brunswick (north of the state of Maine) with the odometer cable disconnected. I find the car offers a large selection of tight places to the do-it-yourself mechanic, though. The body is a sad story, as road salt has been especially unkind. Anyone have a spare? The drive train is ready for a new wrapper.<br><br>
