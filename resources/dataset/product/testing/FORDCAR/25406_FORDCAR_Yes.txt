            I have owned my 94 Taurus for almost five years now and love it.  It has 77,000 miles on it and is still going strong.  I have never had a minutes worth of worry out of it.  We bought it in 1995, shortly after we had our twins.  We mainly chose this vehicle because of it's superb safety record.  I like to drive this car because even though it is a &quot;family car&quot;  it is still very stylish. It also has a very powerful engine. I have never had a car that was this easy to drive, it practically drives itself!  Everything is within easy reach and it is roomy enough to fit two adults and three children in car seats. We have taken it on many road trips and find it very comfortable even with the three car seats in the back. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone that wants a good dependable car that also looks very nice!  My car is 5 years old and I still get compliments on it!  I wouldn't drive anything else. <br><br>
