            After looking at the competing models, the Windstar seemed like the only logical selection. The exterior styling is attractive and all interior appointments are well thought out and easily accessible.  The rear air option is a definite &quot;must have&quot;.  The Windstar has plenty of cargo space behind the rear seat, which along with the middle seat, is easily removable for those large cargo items.  The Windstar is a dream to drive. It handle more like a sedan then a van, and is easily maneuverable.  Overall, I am happy with the Windstar.  The only problem I have been having is finding a Ford dealership with a decent service department in my area. <br><br>
