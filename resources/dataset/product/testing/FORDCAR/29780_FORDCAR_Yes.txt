            First, you should know that I like my 1997 Explorer.  It is an easy vehicle to drive, has a quiet and smooth ride, and has been free of major mechanical problems during the two years that I have owned the vehicle.  Yet, the vehicle does have some annoying problems.  First, I have had some minor electical problems inside the vehicle.  The lighting behind the cruise control button on the steering column works intermittently.  Also, the power lock on the driver's door works intermittently (usually not working).

Another problem with the vehicle is the gas mileage.  I have never received the city mileage claimed on the purchase sticker.  My city mileage probably averages approximately 13 miles per gallon (note that I have the 4.0 L SOHC with four-wheel drive).  The mileage problem is exaggerated by a gas gauge that floats around by as much as an eighth of a tank.<br><br>
