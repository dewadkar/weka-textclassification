            I got my 1993 white Probe when I graduated high school as an off to college present. Since then is has gotten me everywhere I have needed to go with almost no problems. I was even almost totally destroyed in 1995 and rebuilt and it still runs great here in 2000. As a college student who drove the two hours home each weekend I needed a good car that would allow me to do that without trouble. I took drove it half way accross the country when I moved on for graduate school and it still runs great. With it's front wheel drive it handles well in all weather even snow. There has been some wear such as some interior paint peeling on the power window controls but that is to be expected in an 7 year old car. It is not a family car though. The back seat is basically usless for passengers unless they are very small. It rides like a sports car and that is not good for some peoples backs. Onther con is the replacement of bulbs. The bulbs used on this car were intended to never need replacing so when they do it is expensive and they are very hard to find. Most dealerships don't carry them. All and all i would say the probe is very dependable and I convinced my brother to drive one as well. He really liked it unyil someone stole it but that is another story. I have never been disappointed by any aspect of this car<br><br>
