            My wife and I bought a new 1999 XLT Ford 4X4 explorer in September, 1999. We will use the vehicle to pull a fishing boat in the summer and for my wife to commute 22 miles each way in the winter in Wisconsin.

We have no complaints on the vehicle as received.  After the first 3 months of ownership, we haven't been back to the dealer.  All we have done is put gas in it and change the oil.

The ride is not as smooth as I would like on rough roads.  The mileage on the highway was 19 miles per gallon traveling at 75 MPH for a recent trip.
The city driving mileage is about 15 MPG.

Based on the first 3 months of ownership, I highly recommend the Ford Explorer.
