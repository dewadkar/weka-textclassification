            Not another car comes to mind when someone mentions 300k on a stock car.  Of course I've only been around for 18 years, but nonetheless, I only think of one car.  My 1993 Ford Festiva L, has 54k original miles on it, and it's still going strong. . . Yes, I know that it's only 54k miles, but trust me, the way that I have beat on this car would've sent others to the scrap heap.  It has seemed as if the more that I abuse this poor little car, the more it asks for.  I've done almost everything that I can think of with this car.  I've drag-raced a 1990 Dodge Daytona V6.  That was interesting enough, especially when I out accelerated it off the START.  I don't mean to imply that the Festiva actually beat the Daytona, cause as we all know, that would be lying.
    I've also done a LOT of mudding with it.  Oh, and mud races as well (vs. Nissan Pulsar).  I don't want to forget all of the burn-outs that the Festiva has graced the pavement with.
       Now, in normal driving conditions, I've had no problems with it.  I have noticed, however, that once you load more than one passenger (incl. driver) the car seems to bog down noticeably.  
    Overall, this car was perfect for me, having a job that pays about $7/hr, and driving to school and other places everyday.
