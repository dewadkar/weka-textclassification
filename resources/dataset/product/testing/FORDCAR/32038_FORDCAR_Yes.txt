            I own a 1996 Ford Explorer with leather interior and all the options.  It is a classy looking SUV that is luxurious to drive.  It has smooth handling and and has been very reliable.  Cornering is ok but sometimes tippy on very sharp turns.  Four wheel drive is excellent for winter conditions, especially slippery stop and goes.

I would not recommend this vehicle for someone who is planning to drive on rough terrain.  It is very bumpy on rough roads and is better for road driving.

People who should buy this vehicle are small families, individuals who are worried about driving in winter conditions, and anyone who camps or participates in outdoor activities such as skiing or biking.

Overall, this is a great vehicle to own because it is a nice ride, is asthetically pleasing, is good in winter conditions, and has luxurious options<br><br>
