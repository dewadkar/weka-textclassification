            After having a 1991 Jeep Wrangler for a 13 months of driving hell, I decided to look around for a more reliable car at a decent price. Well, I found that and more in my Ford Escort. The price was more than reasonable for me, and from the day that I picked it up, I have had very few problems with it. It has been 6 years now with the original clutch, battery and I have yet to do any engine repairs outside of regular maintenance. The car is excellent on fuel economy and has taken me from Canada to Florida and everything in between during the time that I have owned it. It is an exceptional car and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable used car to buy. 1993 seems to have been a great year for Ford Escorts in my opinion.The only problem that has occurred more than once, is the passenger side window has had problems with opening it, and even that has only taken two trips to the shop over a few years. A minor problem that caused only a slight inconvenience for me.<br><br><br>
