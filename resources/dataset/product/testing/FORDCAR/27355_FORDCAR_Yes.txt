            I bought my 93 Tbird five years ago. It had around 25,000 miles on it and now it has about 73,000 miles. I have really enjoyed owning this car. It has been very reliable and the repairs have been mostly minor. I have replaced the alternator and fuel pump about a year ago. I actually damaged the fuel pump by putting too much fuel system cleaner in the gas tank. I have replaced the lower front tie rods and bushings and recently I found out that I need to replace the water pump and thermostat. I've also had to fix a leak in the air conditioning system (this was the most expensive repair that I've done). It might sound like a lot of repair, but spread out over five years it wasn't very much and the repairs were pretty minor.

The amazing thing is that the car drives like a new car. It handles great and it still looks good because of it's sporty styling. This car has the JBL Premium Sound System that includes a cassette tape deck and a cd player. There are six speakers in the car and a subwoofer that's mounted under the rear deck. The sound is really beautiful. The car also has a very large trunk. The interior is very roomy, especially the front seats. The rear seats can be a little cramped when the front seats are pushed back.

There are some flaws with this car. The head lights are plastic instead of glass and they turn cloudy and yellow in a couple of years. They really make the front of the car look bad and they reduce visibility at night. The interior trim work is not too good either. The headliner gets sun rotted near the rear window and the cloth speaker grills get stained easily. These are prettty minor things but this car is so nice that I like to keep everything about it in tip top condition.

Gas milage is about average for a car this size (21-25 mpg).
I would definitely buy this car again but I would find one with the v8 engine instead of the v6. The v6 is fine on level ground, but it strains when climbing even semi-steep hills especially if there's two or three passengers in the car.

I think this is a very good car that requires less than average amount of maintenace and repair.
