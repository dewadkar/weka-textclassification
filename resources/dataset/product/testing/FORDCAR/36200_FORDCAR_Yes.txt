            I bought this car because I was sick of paying to get my Supra fixed,
I may have been driving a lot slower since i purchased this car , but I have had no regrets.

I Love how roomy the car is on the inside, all of the things that are coming out on the after-market market for this vehicle, the price of this car,styling,gas mileage, and reliability. The only things I don't LOVE about the car is the 130 HP, it could use a little more than that.

Driving in the focus is a pleasant experience that took a little getting used to.  I traded in a modified 1990 model Supra turbo which rode low to the ground and passed everything but the gas station and the mechanic. In the focus I am not too underpowered but I do get passed more often then when in the supra. It feels more refined and a tad quicker than my 91 civic hatchback.  The view is great because of the height of the car and the seats. The factory stereo was pleasant but only stayed in for a couple of weeks.

Anyone who needs a fair priced, compact car, and doesn't need to pay for extra bells and whistles. Also good for people who are buying a car that want to spend more money on putting the bells and whistles in themselves without having to first pay for the factory bells and whistles that would normally be disposed of.  <br><br>
