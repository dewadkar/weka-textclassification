            The Ranger meets the needs of basic transportation, reliability, and utility.  Over the years I racked up 85,000 miles on my Ranger and those miles have been tough ones.  I used this truck to get me around town and to do some handy man type stuff.  The little truck never let me down.  As far as repairs; I have replaced the battery, clutch (at 70,000mi), and the brake light switch. The brake light switch has been replaced 4 times now which is why it is listed as a con.  The switch is not hard to replace and is relatively cheap $15 but I would expect it to last longer.  For the most part the Ranger will take you anywhere you want to go.  The 2.3L in-line 4 is very reliable (this is basically the same 2.3L engine Ford has been using since the late 70's), although lacking in power.  I did notice however that even when loaded down with 1,300lbs of trash the little in-line 4 still had enough power to get me to the dump without any complaints.  The 5 speed transmission is reliable while maintaining the big truck feel you would expect from an F150.  The seats were comfortable for short trips, but after 3 hours they can be too firm.  Fit and finish were excellent.  Even after 85,000 miles of stop and go traffic, hauling trash and yard debris the truck did not have any squeaks or rattles.  The best recorded gas mileage is 27mpg on the highway with an average of 24 for city and highway.  Probably the best asset of this truck is the ride quality.  I have driven Nissan, Toyota, and Chevy, none of them offer the same kind of ride quality in small trucks as the Ranger does.  Handling is comparable to any of the other small trucks.  The fastest I could get that little truck to go was 85mph and it felt stable at that speed.  The in-line 4 is a great engine however it does lack power.  Passing takes planning.  If you will be doing hauling or driving in areas where passing is required, get the V6 engine and 5 speed transmission.
