            I purchased this car in 1998. I bought this vehicle because it was owned by a family member and I was aware that it had had a history of running well and the previous owner had experienced very few problems with the car. It is an automatic. I like the design and the idea of power locks, windows, and the key chain control that allows me to lock/unlock my car. I love the car because it runs smoothly, does okay in the rain, has power windows, lock, etc.. and a very attractive look to it. It has done excellent on long road trips and gets very good mileage. I hate this car because there is virtually no room for any passengers to sit in the backseat. If I so much as put an extra change of clothing on the backseat it appears to take up half of the back of the car. The car has given me a few problems, such as the window motor keeps going out despite being replaced twice and a few other things. It is very tempermental. Most of my problems with the car have been things that would be expected from a 1993 model car. I would recommend this to people who want to look good and feel good in their car. I would say that this car is best suited for people who drive alone or generally only carry one passenger. I would not recommend this car to anyone with children or passengers that would be getting in and out of this car constantly. It is not very easy to let people in and out due to the lack of room in the interior. <br><br>
