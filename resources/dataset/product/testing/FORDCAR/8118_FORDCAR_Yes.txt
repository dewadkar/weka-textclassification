            Friends, the Ford Explorer Sport is one of the greatest cars made for the working mother or any parent who wants a safe, yet great looking car for their newly-driving teenagers!  The Ford Explorer is wonderful for kids who play sports, it's great for mothers with 2+ children to cart around, and it's a great driving experience.  

The affordable Explorer defined the term SUV.  Ford's expedition was also a great move, but it may be a little to big for what most need an SUV for.  The explorer has all the possible options available, most of which come standard.  The stereo system could use some tuning up, but most parents and young children wouldn't care.  The teenagers are the only ones who would love an upgraded stereo.  

I believe Ford did the middle class woman a great service in creating this wonderful car, and I believe that every mother who can afford it should have one!<br><br>
