            This is inexpensive truck that is easy to drive.  The interior borrows a lot from the Ford Explorer and is quite comfortable.  The seats are very supportive.  I would get the V6 for more power which has very good acceleration even on an incline. As with any truck, there needs to be more interior room.  We have had no problems in our first year with the truck. The visibility is very good.  The ride is truck-like, but comfortable.  You sit pretty high up in this truck.

If you need a second vehicle and do not want to spend a fortune on a sport utility vehicle, I would highly recommend getting a Ford Ranger.
