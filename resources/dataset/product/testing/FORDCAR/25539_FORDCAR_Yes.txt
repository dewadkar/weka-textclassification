            We just had our first problem with this vehicle and we haven't had it a month. It doesn't want to start. I don't know if it is the starter or battery problems or alternator. I will update this when we take OUR NEW vehicle in for repair.     

We traded in our 2000 Mustang GT convertible for this vehicle 
September 29, 2000 and we love it. We have had 3 new Mustangs and each one had transmission problems. The Mustang was fun but it had no room and
I felt it was dangerous so we looked at Fords. We were impressed with this vehicle, it was new, pretty and roomy. The dealer let us drive it to lunch and it turned heads. People walk up to the vehicle and look in the windows. The style is a conversational piece. Needless to say, we bought it. The MSRP was $29,030 and the salesman said they don't go down on new vehicles and had to pay the full MSRP (which I didn't like). I asked for the Dealer Invoice and the salesman said he couldn't show it to me or he would be fired. 
  
     They wanted to give us $21,000 for the Mustang with 19,930 miles. I went home and checked out Kelly Blue Book for new and used prices on cars. I pulled up the Mustang GT Convertible 2000 and printed out the trade-in value and the retail value. There was a $4,000 difference between trade-in value and retail value.

     I checked out the Dealer Invoice on the Explorer Sports Trak 4x4 and printed it out. On the Dealer Invoice it shows what the Dealer paid and the MSRP is and again there is about a $4,000 difference.

     We took the computer print out to the dealer and they went down $800 on the MSRP and gave us an extra $1000 on the Mustang. Needless to say we were happy with the deal and we drove it home.

     We love the 2001 Sport Trac 4x4. It doesn't have the pickup of the Mustang but it has many features. First of all it is an eye catcher, everybody stares at it. The color is Harvest Gold. It is roomy, handles well in the mountains and quiet. The windows are electric and the back window is electric also. The inside has the room of a large car. The back seat has their own A/C control and it also offers earphones to plug in for listening to music. Everytime we drive it we discover something new. There are lots of outlets. There is an extra lighter outlet for the phone or use as a charger on the passenger side. There is an outlet in the bed of the truck which is handy for pulling loads and multiple other uses. The bed is roomy and the cage helps keep in loads and is easy to maneuver. The Tonneau Cover was a bit pricey but worth it. The lock on the bed are manual and electric but unfortunately the lock is easily displaced because the wires hang from the Tonneau cover and are easily caught and pulled out. The electric locks need to replace in the bed of the truck (a small inconvenience). The bed is lined and easily cleaned.

     The tires aren't made in the factory where they had problems with defective tires. The tires have plenty of tread. The 4x4 is an easy switch for 2x4 and a low and high option for 4x4. Steering is easy and responds with precision. It doesn't drive like a truck. It's smooth and handles with ease. It's up high so we can see distances. The only problem is getting into the truck/car, it is too high and really needs a step to get in. We don't have a step and it hurts my back to climb in and out but I like sitting up high to see better. We don't like the side step (a small inconvenience).  It's body is solid. The cup holders are away from all electrical outlets. The seats have lumbar support and is the most comfortable I have ever experienced. 
 
     The power remote locks all lock automatically when driving if you forget to lock the door a neat safety feature. It has a keypad on the door to enter if you left your keys in the vehicle or elsewhere which helps those who lock themselves out frequently. 

     The stereo has a wonderful sound along with the CD. There are many bells and whistles we haven't discoved yet. What I like best is the roominess of a car and total comfort along with plenty of storage. We have the option of using it to tote things along with pulling a boat or travel trailer. The storage is the best. We are able to purchase large items and tote them home in the bed of the truck and yet we have plenty of space in the back seat to bring our friends along in comfort. 

     I cannot say enough positive things about this vehicle, it meets all our needs. Drive one and see.  Since I wrote this e-pinion I have another story to tell. On the way to work the windows were all open enjoying the fresh air and when we arrived at work the windows wouldn't go up. All 5 windows were open and the vehicle had to be parked all day with the windows open. Again we had to take it in to have the motor to the windows replaced and wires were crossed.

     While taking a trip and playing the radio and CD I noted that something funny was written on the digital reading and it said HOT.
We took it in and the radio and CD was hot and needs to be replaced. The Ford Dealership didn't have a replacement radio and CD player so they told us not to used it. It could catch on fire. The CD was HOT to touch and so was the radiona and cassette tape. I still haven't gotten it replaced 12/19/00.
