            I bought my 1992 Ford Escort GT when I was a senior in high school.  It was one year old with 10,000 miles on it.  Seven years later, it has nearly 100,000 miles on it, and I have had NO major problems with it.  Overall, it has been a very good car.  The engine in the GT model had enough power to get me through my speedy high-school days and high enough miles per gallon to get me through my thrifty college days.  The only thing negative I have to report, after driving an Escort for many years, is that recently my paint has started to crack.  I have read that it is a problem on most 80's to mid-90's cars because of new EPA painting regulations in the 1980's.  I am unhappy with the paint job, but everything dealing with the car has been wonderful.<br><br>
