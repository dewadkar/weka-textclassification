            Ok, I have read many of the epinions on the Mustang, and a few things are bothering me.  Several people count negative points against this car for gaps that were not intended to be filled.  For example... Many claim that it could have a smoother ride, or a bigger back seat.  Please remember that you are talking about a sports car.

Sports cars by definition follow these general rules... 1)stiffer ride 2)harder seats 3)no trunk space 4)simplistic, easy to read instruments 5)unusable back seat 6)More power than necessary.

I must say that I can understand the thin line between the Mustang and some sedans out there.  It is hands down one of the most comfortable sports cars I have ever driven... In fact I had my heart set on a BMW 328i but bought the Mustang after test driving them both.  I feel I got a better car for the money, and saved myself a bundle.

For a sports car, the mustang has decent trunk space, which is expandable by folding down the back seats.  The only bad thing I can say about the trunk is the size of the opening.  There have been several occasions where I had something that would easily fit into the trunk, but would not fit through the opening.  I have the MACH sound system in mine, which reduces the height of the trunk space where the subs hang down.  If you plan on doing lots of hauling, buy an SUV.

Yes, the instruments and the dash are pretty simplified, but that does not bother me at all.  I figure if you want all of the fancy instrumentation, you don't really want a sports car.

The seats are firm, but not uncomfortable.  I have the leather, and have put an average of 2000 miles per month on this car.  I have never been uncomfortable in it (with the exception of getting into it after it has been sitting in 100 degree Dallas heat... I am happy to say that the air conditioning works beautifully). Finally about the seats, the mustang is one of the few sports cars that is not a pain to get in and out of.  Most sports cars make you feel like you are laying down more than sitting.  That's one sedan-ish quality that I think is nice.

Power and control... =]  the real reason behind the purchase of this car.  I have the GT version with the 17 inch wheels.  It rocks.  The ride is stiffer than any sedan, and for good reason.  It gives you more control of the power under the hood, of which there is plenty to go around.  Go and test drive one of the GTs and you will understand.

I would like to make a somewhat hypocritical point about the cabin noise that this car generates at higher speeds.  Granted, it is a sports car, but If there was a wish list for the future incarnations of this machine, I  would ask for better noise dampening without increasing the cost or weight of the vehicle.  Other Items on the wish list would include a bigger trunk opening, and a second cup holder which is not in the way of the shift knob.

Overall, as a sports car.... this machine is excellent, excellent, excellent.<br><br>
