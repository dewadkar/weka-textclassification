            I don't own a crown victoria but i drive one 8 hours a day 5 days a week and contrary to what some people might think the fords' are holding up alot better than the chevy caprices (we've had both).
   for the most part i would say for police use in new york you can't find a more abusive environment for any car. the chevys' always seemed to be falling apart at about 40k the fords are all at 30-40k and are in far better condition than the caprices with similar mileage. these cars will run for days at a time with no more than an hour rest every 8-16 hours changing only drivers during tour changes. during a tour(shift) change a car will idle for hours at a time then an emergency call will come over the radio and the throttle hits the floor racing to the first intersection you come to then slam the brakes and punch it out again in manhattan this stop and go is frequent and would under these conditions destroy the average vehicle but other than frequent brake jobs the fords are holding up great these 4.6L OHC V8 still purrs like a kitten. i would recommend the crown vic for anyone requiring a comfortable daily driver built to last i do recommend the handling package and the 210 hp dual exhaust model.<br><br>
