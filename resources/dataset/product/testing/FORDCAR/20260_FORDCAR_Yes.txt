            I own a Ford Ranger and must say that I am very pleased with almost everything about it.  I am in college and have to say that traveling to school and back with this truck has made my life so much easier.  It gets excellent gas mileage(appx. 22-24 mpg), rides smoothly, and never breaks down.  I am able to carry a fairly large amount in the bed.  Also, the price is affordable.  The only possible problem I could have would be when I need to tow something such as a boat.  My truck is only a 4-cylinder and can't maintain its usual speed while towing something.  Other than that though it is excellent.  This truck would be a great buy for students or anyone who wants a truck features at an affordable price.<br><br>
