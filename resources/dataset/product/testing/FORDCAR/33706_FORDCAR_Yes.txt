            My Tempo is about to reach the 100,000 mile mark, and it is in pretty good condition,its an 88 with hardly any rust, has a few dents, will fix.The only complaint I have is the color, baby blue. This Tempo has been fixed up with newer parts, performance air filter, top of the line spark plugs, the most air tight driver/passenger compartment(can hold cigarette smoke for hours) I also tested it once with my dad and I in the car. I can reach 80 miles an hour in less than 9 seconds! This is my first car. I wrecked it a little(trunk)but overall it runs, and good. That is all that matters. Ford makes the best &quot;soundproof&quot; cars. I love this car, I keep it shiny everday. People always looked when they see and hear(Bass)coming down the road.<br><br>
