            There are definitely some great advantages of being related to my father. Not only did I inherit his good looks, and his ability to tell a fine story, but I also get FORDS (and any other division like Jaguar) for really cheap!
You see my father was a Ford engineer for 25 years. So, okay I am a little bias. Regardless, the fact that he is now retired from Ford, allows me to get brand new cars at the &quot;Z&quot; price. This is a price that is actually below the price a dealer pays for a vehicle. So naturally, I buy all Fords.
In 1996 I bought my first brand new car of my life (at &quot;Z&quot; price of course). It was scary but thrilling! I have 3 children and so I had decided I needed a mini van. I walked on the lot and immediately fell in love with the Windstar. 
It has a classy look, handles great and has plenty of space! I went with the Windstar instead of the Astrovan because of the chassis. The Astrovan has a truck chassis, while Windstar has a car chassis. This is why you hear owners of the Windstar talk about how well it handles. 
Now, I have to say I bought my Windstar in a very controversial year for the vehicle. A lot of owners of 95 and 96 Windstars have had major problems (most that are covered under warranty). The problem I find with most car owners is they don't know how to fight for their rights to make a dealership honor a warranty. My best advice is, if a dealer does not cooperate take your Ford to another dealer to fix it. You do not have to have your vehicle fixed at the dealer you bought it from. If that doesn't work, YELL, SCREAM, SHOUT! A squeaky wheel gets the grease you know!
Now, I personally have not had one problem with my Windstar. My dealership, and another dealership here in Wichita fight for my affection! Needless to say, I am now buying my second &quot;new car&quot;! We will soon be the proud owners of a 2000 Ford F350 dually crew cab (Powerstroke diesel of course!).
About the only thing I can say about my Windstar that may be a little negative is it's fuel tank is like 25 gallons! But, who cares when you get the kind of mileage I get! Oh yeah one more thing I should mention is the windshield hisses (or whistles), at certain speeds above 50. However, after further research I found this is true in MANY Fords. I have read up on this quite a bit, and have found that no one knows why. There are some funny ways people try to fix this. I personally don't hear it that often so therefore, I do not mess with it!
Now, my next car is going to be the new Windstar with keyless entry, duel sliding doors and some conversions! I'll let you know what I think. Until then...
