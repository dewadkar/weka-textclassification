            General Description:
The Thunderbird provides quality in many areas, including:
*reliability
*cargo space
*seat comfort
*smooth ride
*quiet ride

Reliability:
I have always kept my Thunderbird well-maintained, by taking it to full-service oil change services (like Jiffy Lube) to insure that not only my oil is in good condition, but also the belts, other fluids, filters, and tire pressure.  The only time I have had a problem was when I had a problem with the transmission.  It was covered under warranty, so it really didn't concern me very much.  The problem had something to do with a crack in the transmission.  (I really don't remember exactly.)  But since that was repaired, I have had no additional problems.

Cargo Space:
The trunk is large in length so it can hold lots of things, as long as they are relatively flat (up to about 20", I think).  This includes suitcases, laundry baskets, and many boxes.  However, if you have an abnormally large item, it may not fit due to the shortness of the trunk space.  Generally, I have not had a problem, but there have been a couple of occasions that things just wouldn't fit in there (when I was moving, and when I purchased a piece of furniture).

Seat Comfort:
The seats are so luxuriously cushioned and large, that you will not feel like you are sitting in a car at all.  The seats, even in the back provide plenty of leg room and allow you to completely relax.  The driver's seat is automatic and moves forward/back, up/down, and tilts forward/back.  The passenger's seat is manually adjustable to move forward/back.  

Ride:
Whether you are driving on country roads, around town, or on the highway, you will be riding smoothly in a Thunderbird.  It is very quiet and it never feels as though you are driving very fast, even when you're going 70.

Complaints:
Because the car is so long, it does not fit into tight spaces, nor does it turn sharply.  This is not much of an issue most of the time, but it can be annoying when you wish you could get into smaller parking places.

Also the drink holder inside the car is rather inconvenient.  It is placed inside the compartment between the two front seats.  When you open the compartment, the lid opens towards the passengers side.  This makes it easy for the driver to have access to the drinks, but not the passenger who has to reach over the lid.  Also, since it is located inside the compartment, if you have anything else in the compartment, it usually must be moved in order for the drinks to fit down in there.  The drink holder is really only a piece of plastic with two drink-sized holes that falls down from the lid.
