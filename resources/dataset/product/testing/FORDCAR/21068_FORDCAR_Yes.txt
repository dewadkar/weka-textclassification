            Who would imagine buying a minivan other than a Caravan?  I could not either, until I drove the Windstar.  I have a 1999 SEL Windstar, and I love it.

First of all the car is loaded!  Air, CD player, automatic door, leather, alarm, and much more.

But let's get to the more important issues.  The ride is great!  The van is stable over bumps and handles very well at high speeds.  The turning radius is fantastic which makes parking a breeze.  I like being high up which allows me to see over the other cars on the road.

There are also great safety features on the car that make me feel more comfortable.  There are two air bags in front, and also air bags on the side.  One of my personal favorites is the rear sensing device.  This means that when I am backing up and I get close to an object, the car beeps alerting me that I am about to hit something.

The only problem that I seem to being having with the car is that the automatic sliding doors make some noise when they open and close, and the car had to go back for this to be fixed.

Now, the car is not as big as the Caravan, but it seems to work for me.  In addition, I do feel like I am driving a truck because the dashboard does not wrap around me.  This is something that I got used to, and it helps that the controls all project toward the driver.

Finally, the miles per gallon are better than I expected and I am glad because I save some gas money.

Have fun in your new Windstar...
