               So we were looking for a minivan. After my wife and I decided that we need something bigger than a sedan, we thought a minivan is just the thing. We made a list of vehicles that we'd like to compare...
     Honda Odyssey
     Ford Windstar
     Nissan Quest / Mercury Villager
     Toyota Sienna
   (We did not compare any Chrysler products on purpose.)

   First, what we liked about the Windstar. We like the room, engine, interior features, price and &quot;x-factor&quot;. 
Comparing to the others on the list, the Windstar was as big as the others, except for the Quest, which was the smallest. We were impressed by the luggage room available with the rear bench fully pushed back. It was even better when it was pushed up. Since the rear bench has three &quot;settings&quot;, we were able to balance leg room with luggage room. This, of course, was no comparison to the MagicSeat found in the Odyssey. The MagicSeat is still the best.
   The Ford 3.8L engine is one of the biggest in class. I know it to be workhorse, based on experience with it in the Taurus and other Ford models. In a minivan, not enough engine is a real problem. A full load of 6 or 7 passengers plus cargo can easily translate to half a ton. When we test drove these vans, we had as many people with us as possible, to simulate a real load. (Don't forget, a weak engine may be fine for you and the salesman, but that's no family of four.) Compare to the import competitors, the engine is a bit noisy, but it's the same noise since 1988.
   The interior of the Windstar will win it no awards. It's plain, simple and useful. We liked the overhead console for such things as eyeglasses storage, coin storage and the &quot;conversation mirror&quot;. (The mirror is GREAT for people with kids. Keep an eye on everyone...) There are typical Ford fit and finish problems: wide gaps and different shade dash pieces. The bizarre location of the emergency/parking brake lever took a few tries to over come. (It is located between the driver seat and floor console.
   Price for our particular vehicle was right-on. We have a LX with power windows, lock, tint and side airbags. We did buy it used, with 3,150 miles on it. When we compared prices of a brand new unit, the Odyssey seemed a better buy. At the time of purchase, there were still no Odyssey available. The Toyota was WAY too expensive, for the features that it offered.
   The &quot;X-factor&quot; is simply our overall feeling for this vehicle. It feels solid, very comfortable to drive. The engine is powerful. It was the right vehicle at the right time. We didn't think the dual sliding door was a necessity, but we couldn't live without it now.

   Since we purchased the vehicle June 1999, it has been back to Ford only once for a repair under warranty. One of the front wheel bearing developed a whine, and was quickly replaced. We were notified of one recall for a sticker on the brake fluid reservoir.
