            I've owned my 1993 Crown Victoria LX for 9 yrs now. I bought used in '94 from a rental car fleet sale. It had 42K miles on it then. Today its nearing 138K. Its been very reliable transportation through the years. I have had very few mechanical problems over the years. Usually have it serviced only once a year, at inspection time, and generally need only perform routine preventive maintenance measures as recommended in the Owners Manual.
I have enjoyed the quiet power of its 4.6 liter V8 and its clean comfortable ride. The vehicle is especially nice on long highway stretches. Pop in a tape, turn on the cruise control, and this car practically drives itself.
For a majority of the time I lived in the sunbelt. This car was great on highways of So. Cal, TX, and Fl. But I've been up in New England for the last three years winters and found that the Crown Vic just isn't the right type of vehicle for this type of environment. In 3 winters, I have slid off the the bumpy, icy backroads of NH twice. Both times needing the service of a wrecker to be pulled free. The Crown Vic has very little traction on snow and ice, regardless of what type of snow tires you buy.
As you would expect, the Crown Vic drives like a big car. It does not stop on a dime and does not manuever like a rack-and-pinion race car. Its suspension system does handle the bumps and pot holes of New England streets surprisingly well.
I average about 15 MPG with a 50/50 mix of  city and highway driving.
