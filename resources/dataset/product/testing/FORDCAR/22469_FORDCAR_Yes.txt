            In December 2001 I decided that my Toyota Corolla was too small for my tall, chubby body and I opted to hand the keys over to my older brother and go truck shopping.

I went to see a dealer in Orange, California and three hours later, I drove my nice, sleek 1999 Ford Ranger XLT regular cab off the lot.

I have been driving the truck for almost three weeks now and though it drives like a truck (bumpier and rougher than a Corolla), I LOVE IT.  Just hearing that V6 engine racing when I barely touch the pedal is enough for me :)  

I had been experiencing some problems with the tires on my Corolla.  They never seemed to have any traction in the rain, which made me very nervous at the first site of raindrops.  Now, with my Firestone Wilderness HT tires, the truck grabs the road, even in heavy rain, and hangs on for dear life. 

Another incredible features that is underestimated is the ability to turn off the passenger airbag when my 8 year old sister is in the truck.  It's nice to know that she will be spared any serious injury should we be unfortunate enough to get in an accident.

The one major drawback, of course, is that it's a truck.  By that I mean it loses half a tank of gas when that V6 engine does its job.  You should be prepared to dip a little further into your pockets when it comes time to drive to the pump.  

Overall, I rate this truck as the best ever created.  I might be a tiny bit impartial because I own one, but when you buy a Ranger you know you're investing your money for the long haul and you can haul anything anywhere.

Go out and get one right now.  Don't get a white one though, I already have one. :)<br><br>
