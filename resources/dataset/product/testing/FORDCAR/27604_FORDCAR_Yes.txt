            This February will mark the 2-year anniversary for my little Escape.  I have mostly fond memories as I look back on our adventures.

I admit that I have not driven too many cars in my life and the Escape is my first car.  I will also admit that my ideal car has changed now that I have experience behind the wheel (an SVT Cobra Mustang makes me drool).  But I can still vouch for the good qualities of the Escape and point out it's shortcommings (however few there might be).

Pros:
Let me start with my favorite aspect of the Escape: its sound system.  I went with the optional MACH 6-disk in-dash CD player package which for 2003 is only available if you get the Limited model.  The 6 in-dash is amazing.  No running to the trunk or pulling out disk cartridges to change CDs.  Just hit eject and a number 1-6 on the stereo and the changer moves your disk and ejects it.  This system has all of the benefits of a rear-mounted changer with the convenience of a front-mounted single CD player.  If you are planning on buying a ford vehicle I would say this is a must-have option.

The rest of the interior is unremarkable.  There is nothing that is worthy of praise or words of disdain.  Everything works the way it should and is very simple.  There is plenty of cargo area in the back, especially with  the rear seats folded flat. The rear seats are a bit cramped with tall people in the front.  

Another aspect I am pleased with is the power.  My Escape has the optional V6 which I recommend to anyone who wants to pass on a highway.  I have never driven the 4 cylinder but, judging by its horsepower and torque numbers, I would say it is pretty weak.  The V6, however, has enough power (201 horses) to get me around.  There is only mild torque steer under full acceleration and I doubt most people drive their Escapes as hard as I drive mine.  0-60 time is about 8-9 seconds I would guess (check a car magazine for their test) but it feels faster than that number suggests.

The cornering is fairly decent for an SUV.  There is definitely a fair amount of body roll on most turns and it can get pretty severe during hard-cornering.  I have not flipped it yet and that is saying a lot as I push the limits very frequently.  It handles much better than any other SUV I have driven (Ford Explorer, Land Rover Discovery, Jeep Cherokee).

Parking is something most people do not address and I feel it is very important when choosing a car.  The car is pretty small so parking is usually very easy.  The turning radius is excellent and makes maneuvering in tight spaces a pleasure.  Once the driver gets a feeling for distance out the rear window it is easy enough to get close to the car behind without hitting it; however I lose sight of the front bumper of the car behind me when I get within 4 feet of it.

CONS

I was never a big fan of the Escape's look and I still find it mostly ugly.  A lot of people say they like the way my Escape looks but maybe they are just being polite.  It really depends on your taste.  I was mostly unhappy with the plastic bumpers and molding which have been replaced with painted versions on the 2003 Limited model.  This makes the Escape look much better and I wish they had this option when the Escape came out in 2001.

The noise while driving is the biggest downside to the Escape.  I would not expect Jaguar-like quiet from the fairly inexpensive Escape but the noise can get pretty bad.  After two years of driving the noise has not become worse so if you can bear it during a test drive you are set for at least two years.  I always turn up my music and/or drive with all the windows down and the sunroof open anyway so it doesn't bother me but there are some people who like a little more quiet than I do.

Unknowns

The most off-roading I have done was when I drove on my friend's lawn, so I have no idea how the Escape holds up off the asphalt.  I would guess it cannot handle much more than a muddy trail.  Do not buy an Escape to go off-roading in.  There are plenty of SUVS designed for the off-roader but this is not one of them.
