            I have owned my Expedition for 2 years now.  I think that I have gotten a sense of just how comfortable and reliable it can be.

I tend to do a lot of traveling with the kids during the summer.   I would not trade my vehicle for anything else for long road trips.  The kids sit very comfortable and there is plenty of room so that no one is touching anyone else!  I do have the 3rd bench seat in the back which is great for my oldest so she doesn't have to sit with the babies.  There are plenty of cup holders so that no one has to hold a drink between their legs.  

I have not had many problems with the vehicle and I am creeping up on 70,000 miles.  I have had to have some service done because the check engine light as well as some others would come on for no reason and wouldn't go off.  Just a simple change of fuses and a reset and I was good to go.  The doors are starting to creek a little bit, but that is not anything some WD40 can't take care of.  

One of the worst things that has ever happen is that my husband, in an attempt to be nice, washed my vehicle.  In doing so, he put armor all on the running boards...DO NOT DO THIS!!  It causes the boards to become very slippery and accidents will occur.

I do urge everyone to remember that this is a SUV and it needs to be handled like one.  Slow down with sharp corners to decrease the possibility of roll over.  This is with any SUV.  I have not had any tilting problems with this vehicle what so ever.  

All in all, this vehicle has been wonderful and a reliable source of transportation for me and my family.  As long as you can afford to put the gas in the car, you can ride forever in this monster!
