            I purchased a 1995 Ford Windstar in 1996 with close to 60,000 miles already on it.  Having driven my 1987 Toyota Supra Turbo to the ground (had over 200,000 miles on it at trade in), and having made our first long (12 hour) road trip after having our first child, we decided it was time for a minivan.  In terms of the positives, I love the way the Ford Windstar feels and handles on the road (and that's a pretty high compliment for someone who drove a turbo powered Supra) and I love how roomy it is (7 adults and luggage fit with no problem at all).

Now for the negatives - it wasn't long after I purchased the car (granted it was used), that it started to overheat.  Went through several months of bringing it in and out of the shop.  They finally ended up replacing the head gasket - OUCH, that was expensive.  About 6 months after that, we got a recall notice in the mail about a problem with the engine (specifically its tendency to overheat and blow its head gasket).  Consequently, I got reimbursed about 60% of all the repair expenses I had...but still had to fork out a pretty penny.

I have just over 100,000 miles on the car right now and fortunately have not had any major repairs since the head gasket.  However, there are all sorts of little things (odometer tends to get stuck, things rattle and squeak, etc) that could use repair because they are irritating.

My only other gripes about this car are related to the doors.  For one, on the 1995 model there is the sliding door on only one side.  Since when we first bought it, we've had another child.  To get two children into and out of carseats from one side of the car is a bit clumsy.  The newer models all have sliding doors on both sides now.  Secondly, the rear door is really heavy for some reason.  It is hard to lift up and down easily (particularly when holding a child in your arms).  The rear storage area is also not great for groceries (unless you have tons of stuff) since there is no way to keep things from sliding and rolling around.

I'm sure this car won't last the 200,000+ miles that my Toyota did (which is OK with me - I'm looking forward to a newer minivan with more convenience features).  I'm neither passionately for or against this particular minivan - there are undoubtedly both better and worse.  I won't say that my next one won't be another later model Ford Windstar, but I will definitely be checking out some of the other makes as well.
