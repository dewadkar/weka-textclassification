            I just love my SUV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHy did we buy it? well my lease was up on my Honda and I wanted something that was big enough for the kids and all there stuff,food shopping and just all the stuff that comes along with a family. We went to look at the ford and I feel in love with it as soon as I got behind the wheel and drove it. It drives great handles well for a SUV. 
What do I dislike about the ford? Hmmmmmmmm not sure I can come up with anything. OH yes the only thing I am not happy about it was recalled on two different times nothing major just small stuff.

Driving the Explore makes you feel safe. I like very much being up high and being able to see everything.

Who should buy this vehicle&gt; anyone who wants to be safe, Families this is a great SUV for family. 
When my lease is up I will be getting a new one with out a doubt.<br><br>
