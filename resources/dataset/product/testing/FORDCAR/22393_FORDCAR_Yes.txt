            I recently bought a 2000 ZX2 (Hot model with a manual transmission).  I picked this car up for a few reasons:

1) I wanted a fast(ish) car while I was still young enough to enjoy it.
2) I have always loved Fords.
3) The price tag.

The only options that I neglected to purchase were the 6 CD changer (pointless, you can get a better sound system for much less from Crutchfield), the moonroof (too expensive), and the S/R package (not worth the price, you can do the same modifications yourself for much less money).

I have never been more happy with a car.  The ZX2 has got a great punch on take off, and gets phenomenal acceleration in the higher rev regions (from about 3500-6000 rpms).  Additionally, it comes with tires that are speed rated for 118 mph (in the manual version, 112 for automatics).  The car handles superbly, with a minor bit of rear end shake between 70 and 90 mph (it goes away after that).  Of course, this could easily be countered by the addition of a rear sway bar (don't tell Ford I told you to do that).

One other thing that turned me on to this car was the ease with which it can be modified.  For whatever reason, Ford seems to have made this car so that you can modify it completely and somehow manage to wrench up to about 280 hp out of the original engine.  (No, I don't know how to do this, so don't bother me about it!)  There are a great number of companies out there that make performance parts for this car and they are all available at a relatively inexpensive price.

My only other complaint (apart from rear end shake) is that Ford has fitted two (2!) air baffles in the intake system, and one in the exhaust.  These were put in to lessen the engine noise and make the car sound more... genteel.  WHY?!?  They take a big bite out of the car's performance and you void your warranty if you decide that you want to take them out in order to get a bit more get-up-and-go out of your car.

But, all in all, it's a great car.<br><br>
