            This is truly a feel good car. You get in &amp; feel so good. And it's a good feeling to know it is a reliable car.I own a black 94'convertible. It has some zip &amp; it's &quot;only&quot; a V6. I don't recommend it if you want it as your family car. It's not too roomy in the back. And if you have the top down, the people in back get all of the wind. If they don't like it, they will be miserable. The automatic top is so smooth &amp; convenient. I've put the top down at long red lights. You pull the parking break in addition to being in park &amp; zip, the top takes 10 seconds. Just don't forget to reset the parking break before you drive off! I bet that could be ugly. 
The resale value is not bad either. Mine has only 10,000 miles on it(it's my 2nd car &amp; is strictly summer time driving only)&amp; has a resale value on the market of $14,155. That's not bad for being 6 years old. Nothing will replace the feeling the Mustang gave me when I bought &amp; first drove it as mine!<br><br>
