            I've had my silver 2001 Mustang GT for about a month now, and I'm really enjoying it.  It's a blast to drive, and inspires confidence in traffic.  It's also a cop magnet, so self-restraint *must* be used.  The 4.6L V8 likes to rev, and you can quickly find yourself in violation of all the traffic laws of civilized mankind.  There's plenty of torque available, but you have to wind the engine up higher than you would expect (torque doesn't peak until 4000rpm, horsepower peaks at 5250rpm!).

The interior is nicely styled, and my wife remarked that it looks like her brother's '69 Mach I inside, so I guess they got the retro thing down right.  The controls are pretty well placed in general, though the radio is a bit too low, and if the passenger twiddles the knobs it can interfere with shifting.  The low-back leather buckets are retro as well, right down to the lack of head support.  I'd be a bit scared of neck injury in a rear-ender with these seats, but they are comfortable.

I wish the car had just a tad deeper exhaust tone, and handled a bit better.  The live axle setup in the rear definitely shows on bumpy roads.  Otherwise it feels like what you'd expect -- a '60s muscle car brought into the 21st century.

Maintenance may be a mixed bag -- the car seems really reliable and feels solid, but I've already had to have one of the Mach 460 speakers replaced (under warranty).  I bought the car with 8K miles on it, so maybe the previous owner was over-cranking the stereo.  I've also noticed a few misaligned trim & plastic bits, but I'm really picky that way.

Once last note: the costs of ownership of this vehicle are deceptive.  The car is relatively inexpensive, but the insurance will hurt.  My 6-month premium went up $363 over my Jeep Wrangler, and I'm a 35 year old with no accidents or tickets in the past 12 years.  I'd hate to think what a 20 year old would pay.

On the bright side, it gets better gas mileage than my Jeep, and I get around 20mpg in mixed driving, and as high as 24.5mpg in pure highway driving.
