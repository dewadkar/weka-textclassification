            A friend of mine let me borrow his 2000 Explorer for a couple of weeks, and I didn't want to give it back!  My parents have the Lincoln Navigator, and in comparison, the Ford takes the cake.  The Explorer isn't over-priced, it is comfortable, and it is very versatile.  The Explorer's turning radius is decent for a large vehicle, and thus handles very much more like a car than I expected.  The Navigator is almost $20,000 more expensive, it weighs more, and handles more like what a large vehicle would handle.  The weight difference doesn't really bother me, but I think that has something to do with the ease of driving.  The Explorer can get just as many options as a Navigator, but it is much better quality and better priced.  Another difference between Navigator and the Explorer is gas mileage.  I think, the heaviness of the Navigator takes its toll on gas mileage.  

I really like the space that the interior of the Explorer displays.  It makes great use of space, for instance, I have a one year old son, and getting him in and out of the Explorer is very easy.  The space is also a great thing to have for long road trips.  There is plenty of room in both the front and back seats even for taller people.

A very nice option that I like very well is the All Wheel Drive.  It will prove to have better traction control on wet or icy conditions.  It is an option that you should consider especially if you live in an area that acquires a lot of snow.

My biggest point about the Ford Explorer is it's affordability.  Why would you need to get a more expensive SUV, when this very high quality and yet affordably priced Ford Explorer can give you the exact same performance.  So, when you are looking for a good SUV for your needs, I would suggest looking at the Ford Explorer.  It has excellent quality, it's comfortable and affordable.<br><br>
