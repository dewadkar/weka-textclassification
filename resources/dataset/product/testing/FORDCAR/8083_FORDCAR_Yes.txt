            Climb up into the cab.
Settle into a practical and reasonable comfortable seat.
Adjust your mirror so that you can see.
Turn on the ignition, feel the power under your foot.
Slide in a new Dance Mix CD and crank up the volume.
Now punch it and feel the acceleration and power as you take off in your new Ford Explorer Sport XLT.

Okay, I purchased one of these vehicles and drove it for about 12 months before giving it to my parents.  I have to admit, I purchased it for the fact it was an SUV and the black color with the charcoal grey sport accents made the vehicle look very sporty.  I tinted the windows (illegally dark as usual) and it looks like the bomb cruising down the road.  I have to say, I have always been opposed to Fords in my life.  I have always associated them with Fix Or Repair Daily (FORD).  I can't say, at this moment that I will ever purchase another Ford, but if I do, it will be another Explorer Sport.

The Ford Explorer Sport is actually fun to drive.  It has a V-6 engine and a nice comfortable roomy interior.  Acceleration is very good considering the size and weight of the vehicle and the ride, for the most part is good.  With the Sport Edition I have, I have the offroad type package that doesn't allow for the most comfortable ride, I feel alot of the bump and tend to get lifted off my seat more than I like based on the HORRIBLE roads here in Arkansas.  

The inside of the Explorer doesn't sport any major fancy items.  It contains the basics and standards such as Air, CD player, clock, etc.  There is no wood grain package or chrome package, just the basic dash and console found with almost all Ford products.  That would be an enhancement that I would like to see.  Ford needs a more classy dash for the common part of their vehicles.

Thus far with the Explorer, it has 40,000 miles on it and other than a recall for a bad cruise control wire, I haven't had any problems out it.  

I do have one small problem or two with the overall deal though.  After purchasing the vehicle (yes, I was stupid in purchasing this on a whim), I realized I:

1.  Paid too much for it.  It's maxed out on options, except leather, and I ended up paying $26,000 for the vehicle.  On a 4 year lease, my payments are $424.00 per month.  Not a good thing.

2.  The financing company that Ford uses, World Omni, is a total rip-off scam company.  They have so many loop holes and additional charges its unreal.  The sad thing is that you don't know this until you have already signed all the paperwork.  

The biggest fee is that if I sell your vehicle before the end of your lease, they are going to charge me $1400.00 extra to cover personal property taxes in case they get billed.  Granted, I get that money back a year after I sell the vehicle but that makes trade in impossible since I have to get more money to cover what I owe.  That also means I have no interest on that money since World Omni will be making it.

3.  Trade in Value is horrible.  Since I am leasing, trade is value is okay at the end of the lease but to trade in now, there are so many of them on the road and the prices have dropped since the first ones were sold that trade is in really bad.  They are currently selling brand new ones for about $2,000 less than I owe now on mine.  That is a definate bad deal.  

My parents love the Explorer though so that's cool.  They needed a vehicle and couldn't buy one so I just gave them that one to drive.  It's practical and easy for them to use and haul stuff with if needed.  I do recommend the Explorer Sport, surprisingly enough, just be careful about the purchase and deal.<br><br>
