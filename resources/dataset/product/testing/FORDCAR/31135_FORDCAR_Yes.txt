            I can credit my cousin for introducing me to the Ford Mustang. His father owned several fine 1960 models that I admired. Little did I know that my relationship with the Mustang would last well over a decade. I purchased an Oxford White 1991 5.0 LX hatchback from a local dealership in October of 1991. I traded in a 1987 Pontiac Sunbird that I was rather tired of. At the time, the Ford Mustang ruled the street. There was nothing available new that provided the bang for the buck that America's first ponycar afforded. I happily financed $12,008 after trade in.

The car was a 20 year old's dream come true. It came with 2.73 rear gears coupled with an automatic, so performance off the line was very tame. It would hit 60 MPH in about 7.5 seconds. It wouldn't even break traction from a standing start. It wasn't long before the 2.73's gave way to 3.27's and acceleration improved greatly. The car now sports 3.73's and hits 60 MPH in under 6.0 seconds with other minor mods. The car was tight when it was new. NO squeaks or rattles. Yes there was some minor quality issues, but hey, this was Ford in the early 90's. It is still tighter than my wife's 1998 Cobra Convertible.

I drove the car hard, but took good care of the interior and exterior. I washed and waxed it most every weekend for the first five years of ownership. I have performed all preventative maintenance myself. I have had to replace some minor parts over the decade I have owned it, with one exception. The factory AOD transmission failed at 68,000 miles. I paid nearly $1800 to have it replaced. Other than this failure, I have had to walk once, and that was due to an aftermarket ignition coil that failed.

The car handles well, in my opinion. I am sure the stock suspension is worn out by now, but it still tracks straight and turns sharp when I need it to. I upgraded the brakes with aftermarket pads, stainless steel lines and stainless caliper sleeves. My best braking from 60 to 0 was in 120 feet. The car has run a mid 9 second eighth mile time @ 77 MPH with the minor mods I have done to it on worn out street radials.

That brings me to another issue. The 5.0 Mustang enjoys the biggest performance aftermarket support of any EFI vehicle sold in America. Turbos, superchargers, nitrous, heads, blocks, suspension, you name it, it is made for the Ford Mustang. If you like to modify cars, look no further. Your performance dollar will go far here. You can buy a used 10 year old and make a supercar with the help of the aftermarket.

After two wrecks and a break in, the old stang now has over 209,000 miles on the clock and it still hauls me to and from work. It does this all the while providing a sporty ride and powering me out of trouble. I don't see how you could ask for more. If she blows up tomorrow, I'll have gotten my money's worth and more. You can't put a price on ten years of performance driving. Did I mention that the factory AC still works after ten years?

The biggest drawbacks to Mustang ownership is the higher insurance, higher fuel consumption compared to smaller engines, and frequently replacing tires. My tire life has ranged from 16,000 to 33,000 miles. That means new tires every year or so. That can get expensive. I average around 20 MPG.

Oh, another drawback is that kids want to race you at stoplights. But that is another story.....
