            I own a 1993 Crown Victoria LX with a performance and handling package. It is the perfect compromise between a sports car and a luxury sedan wrapped in one, not to mention it was fairly affordable. This car currently has 99,000 miles on it and I take immpecable care of my vehicles. As you know, it is equipped with the dependable 4.6 V8.  I also have a 1992 Town Car with the same motor with 119,000 miles and very happy with both.  Only one problem.  At approximatley 90,000 miles on almost every 91 to 97 Ford passenger vehicle with the 4.6, that I have seen,it burns oil terribly after the car takes off after idling for a short period of time. I assume this is valve guide seals and NOT bad rings.  I have called my local Lincoln and Ford dealer to see if they have had a 4.6 apart for that same reason.  They said they haven't.  I find this hard to believe.  This problem gets worse especially when you approach the 120,000 mile mark.  I only hope the remedy is to replace the valve guide seals to probably some tune of $800 and not a complete rebuild upwards of $2800.  Both of these cars run beautifully but the oil problem is becoming a nuiscance and embarrasment, especially if your car looks like it has 30,000 miles instead of 230,000. It would be okay to assume one should expect this motor to be pretty much trouble free for 200,000 miles with regular oil changes,......shouldn't it?????

If you have this same problem or know a solution please let me know.
Thanks, RB1.  <br><br>
