            Personally the Ford Explorer in my opinion is very over rated.  I didnt like the way it rides.  A little rough, and shaky.  The premium sound system was not premium at all.  The looks are very nice.  But if you are looking for a great overall SUV I would recommend the Chevy Blazer.  The explorer doesnt offer as many options as the chevy blazer does on its basic features in the standard car.  This would be a great safe good looking car for a younger driver but for the more established driver The Jeep Grand Cherokee, or the Lexus RX300 would be highly recommended.<br><br>
