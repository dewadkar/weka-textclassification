            Too bad Ford is discontinuing the Contour after the 2000 model year. If it had been designed with a slightly larger rear seat, it might have appealed to more people. Quality, at least on my car is up to par.  I use it for commuting, so even though the 2 liter 4 cylinder could be more powerful, I have an automatic transmission, which seems to steal a lot of power from the engine.  it is OK for me. The steering is tight and very responsive , holds the road very well .This will be the car my teenage daughter learns to drive. Safe and not flashy.<br><br>
