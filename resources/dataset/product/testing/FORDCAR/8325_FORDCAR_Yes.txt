                I bought my car (1993 Ford Probe) in the summer of 1998 from a used car dealer in my area for $6000. It wasnt too expensive at the time for a college student.  I realized i could have gotten the GT for the same price at another place.  Anyways, during that summer I really didnt have anything go wrong with it, only except to get 2 new tires and a few other minor things.  

    I really didnt start having trouble with it until that winter.  Me living in Maine, we get alot of snow and the roads arent as good.  I found that because the car is so light overall espically in the back end, it was hard to drive in the winter.  I would lose control of my car alot.  

As time went on, I had alot of other problems including electical and exhaust. I recently had to get a whole new exhaust (spent $400).  I also had to get a new distributor cap and wires which cost me a few hundred dollars as well.  When getting that fixed i was told that my axle needs to be replaced as well.

I have had nothing but problems with this car.  Even though the style of the car is very nice looking and it appeals to the eye and if you feel like you can add things to make it better, i highly recommend you NOT get this car espcially if you are a broke college student trying just to get by.  I have had alot of problem with this.  Unless you are willing and have the money to spend, then DO NOT get this car.  I have talked to alot of other probe owners as well and they also say that they have had bad things happen to them as well.  I highly recommend you do not get this car!<br><br>
