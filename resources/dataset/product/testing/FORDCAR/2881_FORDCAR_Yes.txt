            I purchased my escort LX wagon for $2500 from family members back in February '03.  It was my grandpa's car, and as far as I know, I am the third owner.  It has a manual transmission and had 118000 miles on it when I got it.

I love this car!  Yes, it is a station wagon, and my not be considered as cool on a college campus as a Jetta or Civic, but I wouldn't trade it for anything just yet.  There is a ton of cargo space in this rather compact model, enough where I can even fold down the seats and sleep comfortably in the back (granted, I am only 5'4").  The gas mileage is great (about 30 mpg) considering how old the car is, and I was surprised at how well the car accelerates (so surprised, I named the car Zippy).  It can handle heavy loads, even up canyon roads, although there is a considerable decrease in acceleration power.  I have yet to have any problems with this car in the seven months I have had it.

Everything does have a bad side, though.  The car is as basic of a model as you can get.  No power locks, no power doors.  There isn't even a tachometer (so if you are learning how to drive a stick with this model car, you have to learn my listening to the car, instead of watching the rpms on the tachometer).  

However, the good outweighs the bad in this case.  The escort wagon is a great car for newer drivers, and new families.  It may be very basic, but it performs well, and I hope to have my car for quite a few more years!
