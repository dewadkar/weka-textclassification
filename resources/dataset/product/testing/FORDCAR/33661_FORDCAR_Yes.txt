              I purchased the Ford Escort SE Sport new in 1998.  I chose it because, being a college student at the time, I wanted something that was affordable but also nice looking. I have not regretted buying this car since then.  
  In the five years I have owned the Escort, I have only had to have the wiper motor replaced (covered by warranty) and routine maintenance done to it.  I bought new tires and brakes in 2001.  For the length of the original 3 year, 36,000 mile warranty, I changed the oil every 5,000 miles and followed the service manual's guide as to when the car needed maintenance.  Since then, I only change the oil and rotate the tires every 10,000 miles and currently have 55,000 miles on the car.  I am so pleased with how little I have had to have done to this car! It worked great for me in college and it is now my husbands work car because we bought a van for our family vehicle. 
   The pros of the Escort far outweigh the cons, in my opinion but here they are:

PROS:
-Affordable for a car in its class (4-door sedan)
-The redesigned body of Escorts made after 1997 is very
 stylish.
-Rear seats fold down for more space from the trunk. That's
 great for skis and other long items that normally would not
 fit in a small car.
-This is a very reliable car.  Very little has had to be 
 done to it in the 5 years I have had it.
-Gets good gas mileage. 

CONS:
-The backseat is not very comfortable for an adult. There
 is not much legroom.
-When the drivers side window is open and you turn the
 windshield wipers on, you get wet.
-I find myself wanting an armrest to lean on at stop
 lights. ;)
