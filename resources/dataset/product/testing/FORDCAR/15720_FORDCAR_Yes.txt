            My Windstar is a 1995.  I'm the one who picked this out from all the other vans.  I've been a long time Honda fan, but the old Odyssey was too small.  I liked the Windstar's styling.  But from the very beginning, it has had a lot of annoying problems.  The door &quot;dinger&quot; tops the list.  It goes off all the time.  The door sensors do not work well- many nights I am outside opening and re-closing all the doors to get the interior lights to go off!  I have also gone through 2 keys- they just wear out and won't open the locks!  Weird problem , but this has never happened on my Hondas!  I haven't had all the engine problems I've started reading about, but now I'm nervous. I did need a FULL brake job at 40,000 miles.  The rotors had to be replaced. Obviously their QC is lacking!  I only have 52,000 on mine, and I'm going to sell it when my 2000 Odyssey gets here.<br><br>
