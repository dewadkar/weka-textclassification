               I don't own this car, but even though I don't own it I know it like the back of my hand. The reason I know it so well is because ATLEAST 3 times a week my dad and I go to San Francisco and back to Los Angeles in that car. My dad has only had this car for 3 years, and it still runs like a dream. We have never broken down or had any problems. We have covered so much land with this car that you won't believe. My dad got used with 26,000 miles on it to start, and within only 3 years we have already put it to 210,000 miles. I don't think any other car can be designed to be as well built as this one. With one full tank of gas the car can travel 500 miles, it takes about 29 miles per gallon. The ride is amazing it is like you are riding on a cloud. I didn't even mention how much room there is in the car, the car is like a living room. This car is also one of the safest cars on the road. This car is also so heavy, at a speed of 55 miles per hour it can pick up a full size Sport Utility, or a full size van and throw it off the road rolling 30 yards away and the Crown Victoria won't even have a scratch and neither will the persons inside. It is impossible to hate this car. Whoever hates it must have had a bad at Vietnam. All that awesome stuff I told you and I still haven't told you about the handling in this machine. I'll put it in this way, at full speed you can steer with your pinkies, the is a miracle. No other car company can match this. This car is so long, and even though it so so long it can do a u-turn like a golf cart. The trunk space is also so long that you can fit 6 of your x-wives without any problem. Great for golfers and people who need to go to great lengths with heavy and spaceful equipment (speakers, bikes, luggage etc.). Nobody can go wrong with this car. This is the best car ever made!!<br><br>
