            Recently, I found a gently (653 miles) used 2003 F150 Supercrew XLT 2WD with 4.6 V8 and a few nice options at a Chevrolet dealer's lot in Houston, Texas.  The full sized 4 door truck appealed to me as a suitable alternative to a big SUV, due to the inclusion of a standard pickup bed and therefore, pickup capabilities.  The price was right and my wife and I decided to buy the truck after driving it for a day.  

Right off the bat, we noticed the truck was very comfortable with adequately padded cloth 60/40 bench seats up front and a standard bench which folds down in the rear to accommodate gear.  The seating is very easy to adjust to the likings of almost anyone, especially when the truck is equipped (as ours is) with the power adjustable pedals.  The truck has front and rear powerpoints for plugging in your favorite electronic gizmos.  Cupholders abound in this version of the F-150 with two (one doubles as an ashtray if you leave the removable ash container in it) popping out from the dash, two on the folded down console (one a "supersize" cupholder which, careful, does not hold a standard container snugly) and two folding down from the rear of the front seat for passengers travelling aft.  The fold down console, front door panels, and overhead flip down compartments up front offer a nice array of places to store your goodies.  Not much room behind the rear seats except for a couple of rather tiny plastic lidded compartments. 

 Our truck came with the black Westin "nerf" bars and a conventional bed liner (non sprayed type).  The 4.6 V8 is smooth and relatively quiet, and provides adequate acceleration and passing power.  We have not trailered with this truck as of yet.  Don't challenge the guy driving the new Dodge Hemi to a drag race with your 4.6L equipped Ford.  Getting onto the Interstate is not a problem, however, and the truck has a margin of passing power.  The electronic overdrive tranny shifts surely and smoothly.  Expect around 13-14 mpg around town and around 18-19 hwy under normal conditions.  Tires are the stock General Ameritracs and are not the best quality tire you could find.  AC is nice and cold with strong circulation.  Seat positions are easily attained even though our truck does NOT have power seats.  Standard CD deck is fine and does a nice job, although it is no powerhouse.  The lockable tailgate is a great feature and helps you keep the gate up when you want it to stay that way.  

 We have noted the exhaust system tends to bump the bottom of the truck due to it's rubber mounts, which tends to be rather annoying.  You taller drivers might want to watch your knees when getting behind the wheel if the seat is left a little too far up.  We have found the brakes to be firm and responsive, but a little bit prone to fading if leaned on.  It would have been nice if Bill Ford and his friends had included cargo pouches on the back of the front seats...  On the plus side, for a truck this size, the maneuverability is quite acceptable. At this time we have put about 5K miles on the beast with no problems.  - B Finley, Houston, Texas
