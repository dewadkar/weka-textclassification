            I have a 1992 Ford Ranger extended cab truck that has the 4.0 liter v-6 and 5 speed transmission, the truck had 89,000 miles when I purchased it. The truck rides and drives great and is a pleasure to drive and is very comfortable out on the road. The engine offers good power along with good fuel mileage and might be a little overkill for some people but allows a lot of versatility for every user.   This truck is very dependable and I have never had any trouble with it at all and I would recommend it to anyone for their next purchase<br><br>
