            Its Big, its Heavy, Its Roomy and it Eats Gas!  But its a great Sports Utility Vehicle.  The 1999 Ford Expedition XLT has ample room for 8, can be stripped of 3rd row of seats (very back) with 2nd row of seats folded down and hold lots of stuff!  All around its a great vehicle.  I have over 22,000 miles on it, have owned it for just 8 months, and swear by it.  Its reliable, have not had a PROBLEM.  Its Gas Mileage leaves something to be desired, winter around town drops to 14 mpg, but spring, summer &amp; fall is still an average of 16 mpg in town, 19 on the highway.  Its seats are comfortable, and it just runs well.  Overall its a great vehicle.  You can comfortably take it on long trips, or short hauls, and actually have many uses for it.  The roof rack is great and adds that much more.  It has a big engine, 4.6 liter, cloth seats, aluminum wheels and can even tow a big load with its trailer hitch.  I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a big vehicle with lots of room for people of stuff!<br><br>
