            That is the question I am currently asking myself about this piece o' cr@p Ford Escort I bought.

The car was originally owned by someone else and the original engine in the car went out at 87,000 miles - a piston started knocking. I think that we can all agree that no well-made car has an engine die at 87,000 miles! 

So, I was given the car and bought a new engine for it in June, 2000.  Well, before that first engine died, there was a rattling sound in the engine for a few months and I started hearing that same rattling noise in mid-October in my brand-spanking-new $3,500 engine. 

I wanted to let you consumers know that the Ford Escort is known to have problems with the Intake Manifold - a curved part that sits on top of the engine.  The problem is that little pieces of metal get loose and fall down into the engine.  They get stuck in valves (causing that rattling noise) and eventually make their way down to the pistons where they totally screw up the engine.  

The original Intake Manifold was left in the car when I got the new engine installed in June.  Apparently another piece has fallen into the engine and ruined ANOTHER engine. 

I have been told by an engine manufacturer that this has been a common problem with the Escort, so if you start to hear a rattling noise...kinda like a sprinkler inside your engine...then this may be the problem.  I went to five mechanics before someone finally figured out what it was, so maybe this will save you the hassle!
