            Lets put it this way....my grand mother drives this car.  It is rahter big and some what comfortable in the interior.  But it has horrible gas mileage and is quite ugly.  If your are under 60 years of age and want to hold up any kind of an image this car might not be a good idea.   It handles turns pretty well but the acceleration isnï¿½t that great and it is a real pain to park because it is so wide and long.  However it is dependable, so if that is what you are looking for this is a good car.<br><br>
