            We bought our used 1994 Ford Taurus Station Wagon when I was 8 months pregnant with our second child.  I have been so glad that we made this purchase everyday for the past 3 years.  One major selling point for me is gas mileage.  Highway gas mileage is easily 30 mpg.  Even around town, picking up and dropping off kids and trecking to the grocery store and my volunteer job, I can get about 24 mpg!  It's got lots of room for my three kids including two in car seats.  My two mid-size dogs enjoy bopping around in the back too.  The structure is strong and reliable.  Being in the military and having family in many other states, we've done a lot of traveling and still have not had ANY problems mechanically.<br><br>
