            My mother bought the Crown Victoria in 1998.  What a car!  It is nice to get behind the wheel of a large 4 door rear wheel drive American car again.  I didn't know how much I missed it until I drove my mother's Crown Victoria.  (10 years ago or make that 15 years ago I would have called it &quot;Grandmother's Car&quot;)

The car is very spacious, comfortable, has plenty of power and is geared for long trips.  

One thing that I do not like about the vehicle is the gas mileage.  My mom seems to get 12 miles in the city and 16 miles on the highway.  The gas mileage might be poor, but the comfort, safety and power make up the difference for the poor mileage.  

I hope that Ford continues to make rear wheel drive vehicles.  The Crown Victoria has a place in the car world.  The vehicle is a great car and serves many needs. <br><br>
