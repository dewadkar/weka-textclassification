            <i><b>ROLLIN'</b>
In my five-point-oh
With my rag top down
So my hair can blow

Girlies on standby
Waitin' just to say hi
&quot;Did you stop?&quot;
No, I just drove by

- Vanilla Ice</i>


I have been a loyal Volkswagen owner for a long, long, long time (gee, 15 years and something like 8 VWs, three of them brand new).  Ever since my parents had a Plymouth Horizon when I was a kid, and the thing was constantly breaking down and falling apart, and all the stuff in the news about Chrysler going bankrupt and quality problems in American cars, I came to distrust American cars.  When I reached car-buying age, after going through a short 4x4 truck phase, and earning a little more money and moving towards a yuppie phase, I went out and bought my first brand new car: a 1985 Convertible VW Carbriolet.  Ever since then I have been a die-hard volkswagon adherent.  They drive SO nice and are SO reliable (fahrvegnugen).  I also owned one Toyota and one Honda, both of which were ultra reliable and solid.  I became convinced that Foreign=quality &amp; reliability, American=crap.

So recently when I decided I was ready for a brand new car, and a step up in performance and prestige, I was thinking &quot;Porsche? BMW?  Ferrari?&quot;  As always, American didn't even  cross my mind.  The only problem is I live in an old Victorian and it doesn't have a garage, just an old carriage house, which is too shallow to  accomodate a car.  So that prevented me from getting one of these hot foreign cars, which would be too nice to leave on the street where I am forced to park (my 100 year old house doesn't even have a driveway, or room for one on its lot).  I was stuck in limbo.  All I knew was I wanted a hot, convertible sports car.  I have never been a Mustang fan and again, American in general just didn't, would not, occur to me.

Until one day I walked buy a 2000 Ford Mustang GT Convertible, metallic silver, with a black top (without the molding on the doors that some of them have).  I didn't look at it; I just am not oriented toward even looking at American cars--this car just jumped out and <i>siezed</i> my attention.  It stopped me dead in my tracks, cold.  I said to myself, &quot;DAMN!  That is ONE NICE LOOKING VEHICLE!&quot;  I walked around it slowly in awe.  I don't know what they've done vs. last year, but this car is so cool and sexy looking, especially the convertible.  And I just loved the metallic silver with the black top, the rear spoiler, and the big, wide tires.

So a few weeks later, I'm sitting around on Memorial Day weekend with nothing to do, so I say to myself &quot;I think I'll pop down to the Ford dealership and see what they got.&quot;  I walk onto the lot, and as if it were  fated, they had one mustang convertible on the lot: a metallic silver convertible GT (the GT is the version with the 4.6L V8 engine (down from the 5.0L of earlier years (that Vanilla Ice rapped about) but by all accounts just as powerful) and high-performance suspension, and rear spoiler.  I new I wanted the GT - the car also comes in a V6 but I wanted all the power I could get, and unfortunately I was not aware of the Cobra Mustang at the time), with ALL the options I wanted (black top, black leather interior, premium sound system, CD player, automatic tranny, power everything, 17&quot; alloy wheels, wide, low profile tires, etc.).  I started thinking &quot;Oh sh#t, I'm in trouble.  I'm going to buy this car today.&quot;  I had no idea what it would cost, but it was such a beautiful, high-performance car, and a convertible to boot, I was guessing &quot;high 30s&quot;, like $38,000.

I was dressed in shorts, a skater t-shirt, a baseball cap worn backwards, sunglasses, and thongs, and probably looked at a distance like an 18 year old (I look young anyway), so several salesman walked right by me and gave me no attention.  Finally, after I had gotten in the car, turned on the stereo, and started playing with trying to get the automatic convertible top to lower (why not?  I knew it was mine), a salesman approached and asked &quot;May I help you?&quot;  I said &quot;yeah, can I drive this?&quot;  He looked at me skeptically and said &quot;What do you drive now?&quot;, trying to qualify me.  I told him &quot;a '98 V6  Jetta.&quot;  That seemed to satisfy him.  He perked up and started running around looking for the keys and getting cars moved so we could get out.

While he did all that I went to my car and got a good CD (the Police, greatest hits).  Out we go on the test drive, out into the city streets, on a beautiful sunny day (topless, of course!)  I did not go easy on it.  I really wanted to test it out.  I punched it, took corners at high speeds, floored it when entering the freeway, really took it through the paces (why not, I knew it was mine).  I was totally satisfied, even after 15 years being spoiled by the best of Fahrvegnugen, including their closest thing to a hot-rod, the V6 Jetta, with the handling and power of this car.  It was definitely a step up from my V6 Jetta.  Definitely faster and more powerful, but at a much lower RPM.  The steering and suspension felt tight and trustworthy on corners.  The automatic transmission shifted quickly and smoothly at all the right times.  

The salesman pointed out that the RPM was only at like 1200 or 1500 as we cruised down the freeway at 65.  I knew in my Jetta at that speed we would have been at 3 or 4k.  He also pointed out how quiet it was, even with the top down, but with the windows  rolled up, at 65 miles an hour we were able to carry on a conversation with ease, and no need to raise our voices one bit.  

I fixed that.  I pushed in my CD, cranked up the volume, and punched the accellerator to the tune of &quot;Don't Stand So Close to Me.&quot;  The stereo system let out perfect deep bass and crisp treble, the dual exhausts roared a deep throaty rumble as we accellerated, the wind was in our hair, and before I knew it we were doing  90.  I was in love.  

And the best part: it was priced at about 10,000 less than my first guess.  Only $28,000 dollars!  After the salesman and I agreed on that price, I admitted I had been prepared to pay <i>at least</i> $38,000.  He said it is believed that if not for the economies of scale Ford is able to achieve due to the high volume of production they do; if the Mustang were manufactured at the same volume of say a BMW, it would probably cost around $60,000.  

Needless to say we did some paperwork and I drove off that day with my newest most prized possession.

This epinion has focused on my disillusionment, now obsolete, with American cars, and how one very superb, sexy, beautiful, powerful, sporty, fun car swept me off my feet and woke me up to the new world order: American cars are great again.  I have not covered the mechanical side; I just know this car drives great, is super fast and powerful, corners and handles wonderfully (although a bit squirrelly in the rear end if i'm not careful, compared what I'm used to, due to the raw power and the rear-wheel-drive -- this is not only the first American car I've ever owned but also the first rear-wheel-drive.  I just have to get used to it and be carefull about gunning it in a tight turn (I already fishtailed it once shooting through a gap in oncoming traffic on a left turn into a gas station--the prices of raw power)).  It also sounds great, looks FABULOUS (at least the convertible GT with the rear spoiler, big wheels and wide tires...I'm not quite as enamored with the hardtop coupe, and I think the V6 hardtop coupe without the rear spoiler is positively bland looking, at least by comparison)...I love everything about it.  Everything about it reeks of the quality I am accustomed to in foreign cars.  What I <i>can</i> tell you mechanically is that my brother is a very experienced auto mechanic who has worked on every kind of car and now works as a mechanic for a Ford dealership, and he tells me the V8 is a great engine (although the V6 has some overheating problems, he told me).

So I didn't get my Porsche, my Beemer, or my Ferrari.  I spent a fraction of what I would have spent on one of those, and got a every bit as much of  a high-performance convertible sports car as far as I'm concerned, and I am totally 1000% satisfied and in love with my car.  America is back, and it feels great!<br><br>
