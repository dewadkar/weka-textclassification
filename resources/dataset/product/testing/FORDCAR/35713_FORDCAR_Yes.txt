            Back in January of 1990 my husband and I decided to go hiking down in southern Ohio, it was a beautiful day with the temperature in the high forties.  We hiked all day and had a fantastic time, it was getting dark so we decided to head on home.

On the way home my husband asked me if I wanted to stop at <i>Ed Mullinax Ford</i>, in Amherst Ohio, just to check out the new cars without being hassled by pushy sales people. By the time we rolled into the parking lot it was midnight on a Saturday night, a perfect time to look at cars.  To our dismay they were actually <i>open</i>, they were running a special <i>Super Bowl Sale</i> and they would be open until four a.m. that morning.

We decided to stay and look and I am glad that we did.  My husband asked me if there was any car that caught my eye and I replied, <i>that light blue Mustang</i> sitting over next to the white one.  The salesman was not pushy and let us take as much time looking it over as we wanted.  My husband exclaimed, <i>Happy New Year</i>, I'm buying you this car!  I couldn't believe it and I still can't, we filled out paper work and drove it the rest of the way home that night.  This began my love affair with my <i>Mustang</i>.

I have <i>loved Mustangs</i> since I was a little girl and I always wanted one but I never thought I would actually own one.  I have owned this vehicle going on <i>eleven years</i> and I still consider it to be my <i>baby</i>.  It is a dependable automobile and my main mode of transportation.  

<b>Pros</b>

<i>Easy handling
nice acceleration
good gas mileage
plenty of space for grocery shopping</i>

The ride is smooth and when transporting groceries I just take the cargo area cover off and push the rear seats forward for extra room.  The grocery attendant that helped me lug two carts full of groceries out to my car last week was very <i>impressed</i> that all of it fit in my car with no problem.  The car is very deceiving that way, it is really quite spacious when transporting many things.  The steering has a little play to it when compared to the newer cars of today, it doesn't bother me however because I am use to it.  I drove my Dad's newer Honda Accord and the steering was much tighter than I was use to.  

The stereo system is of very good sound quality and the speakers really rock for being included in the package when I bought the car.  My husband's sound system in his Chevy Blazer is terrible and it is a newer vehicle than my Mustang.

<b>Gas Mileage</b>

The gas mileage for this car is between 21 and 25 mpg in the city and between 27 and 32 on the highway, all depending on driving conditions.  This is a big <i>plus</i> considering the higher gas prices these days, it makes me glad I still have my <i>Mustang</i>.

<b>Cons</b>

<i>Winter driving
Blind spots
No cup holders</i>

This car can be pretty tricky to drive in winter driving conditions, it fish tails quite a bit when there is the slightest little bit of snow on the road.  I put two fifty pound bags of sand inside my hatch and position them over both rear tires each winter.  This seems to help with some extra traction.

There are some blind spots that are a result of the way the hatch is designed.  I am always extra careful when merging into another lane and I always double look over my shoulder because of the blind spots.

There are absolutely <i>no cup holders</i> in this car!  Ford has decided that people don't drink in this car I guess, I have tried many portable cup holders but none seem to be stable enough for me to use them all the time..this is a big <i>inconvenience</i> for the car owner as far as I am concerned.  Cup holders must have been over priced that year.

<b>Conclusion</b>

This is a great vehicle to own, the only repairs I have made to this car have been normal wear and tear purchases.  I've purchased new brakes, shocks and struts, and just recently a new radiator.  I'm on my second set of tires also which I will replace next year.  I baby my vehicle and I always make sure the oil is changed when needed and a tune up performed periodically.

The best part is I am approaching <i>seven years</i> without a car payment, and the car keeps going and going, <i>hence the title of my article</i>.

When I replaced the radiator two months ago the technician said that this car has probably another ten years left in it because it is in such great condition.  It has only two little spots of rust each on the rear quarter panels by the back tires.  I plan to have the spots rubbed out and have my car totally repainted within the year.

I think this car was definitely worth the price I paid for it and it has been very <i>dependable</i> for me.

I would recommend this car to anyone.

<i>I love my Mustang</i>.<br><br>
