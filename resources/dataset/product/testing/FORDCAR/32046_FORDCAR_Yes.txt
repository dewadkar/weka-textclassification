            I love my Ford Explorer XLT 2WD 4 door!  It has all of the great additions with nothing missing (in other words, it's loaded) and it was a good deal when I bought it used three years ago.  The fact that it's a 2WD v6 saves us the gas consumption of a larger engine with 4WD.  The vehicle has plenty of pep for a v6 in it's size.  


The handling/steering is nice and snug, it corners well, and I like riding higher than some vehicles.  (As with a truck or SUV, the vehicle handles differently from a passenger car and should be driven with care in this regard.)  I don't personally think this vehicle would be dangerous and prone to rolling over on the road and if the driver is familiar with this type of vehicle, there should be no problem at all.  

We are TALL people and there is plenty of interior room in the front and back seats.  The front two seats have optional lumbar support (so nice) and power adjustments. The back seat can fold forward so that the entire back is open.  We have used this feature for naps, hauling long or odd-sized items, and my husband folded it down so I could ride more comfortably to the hospital in labor with my second child! 

I like the sunroof and stereo with cassette plus six-disk CD changer, which affords virtually hands-free operation while driving.  The running boards are a nice addition because they make it a snap for kids to climb in, as well as smaller persons with shorter legs.

I also like the way the rear door opens.  The top glass portion opens independently of the entire rear door and this is a convenient feature for pets riding in back, as well as unloading groceries or loose items that might roll and fall out if the whole door opened at one time.  

I have loved this vehicle with my two kids.  Leather interior is WONDERFUL with kids, it is so easy to keep clean and looking nice.  A cloth interior would have shown wear long before and not smelled as good as leather does either!  The rear radio controls are nice, especially with two headphone jacks so that individuals in the back seat can listen independent of the front seat.  (This feature can be disabled by reading the manual, if only front control is desired.)  Rear vents with controls for air flow are also great.  Window lock and child safety doors (that only open from the outside) are nice options for those with young ones that like to play with the switches and handles from the back seat.  

The keyless entry with keypad at driver's door is VERY nice, since there is no worry of the doors being locked from the inside and locking keys in or children locking themselves in, if experimenting with the buttons.  :o) My husband likes that he doesn't have to keep track of an extra key to get in and I like the remote key ring for locking/unlocking even from a distance!

The windows have a nice tint to them and the vehicle looks GREAT.  We have the regular maintenance done and we have not had too much trouble, although there have been a few things that have needed attention more than I would have liked.  We did not have a problem with the whole tire situation with Ford Explorers, fortunately.  

The gentleman we bought this vehicle from really did not want to part with it and neither would I.  I have been extremely happy with it and will continue to be.
