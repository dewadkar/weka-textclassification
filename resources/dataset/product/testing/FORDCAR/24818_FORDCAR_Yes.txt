            2000 FORD MUSTANG
The restyled Mustang is powered by one of the following engines; a 3.8-litre, 190-hp V-6, a 4-6-litre, 250 hp SOHC V-8, or a 4.6-liter, 320-hp DOHC V-8(available on the Cobra model). Also choose between a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. ABS is optional.

The 2000 Ford Mustang coupe. Total panty dropper. With its sleak new styling and great power output, this car was built to get women. If you are 17 years old like I am, and love to race, this is definitely your car. With a more than modest price of $16,500, there is NO better value for under $20,000. This car is my fathers, and will be mine. Ford has definitely gained my confidence in them after having driven this car. With my 0-60mph being only 6.9 i must say FAST!! Having already left, Camaro's, Eclipses, Integra's, Avengers, Cougars, Celicas, all in the dust. This is the car to have. I love the standard features like the CD player, rear defroster,power windows,doors, and locks, and just too many other things to list, this car is of great value. Fathers, this is the car you need to get your son. We have had it now for 6 months, except for the fact that I have too many girls and just too little time. The 40hp addition from the 98' models make this car the one of the fastest in its class. A great car for a great price, and thats all i got to say.


Although this car is definitely an eye catcher, there is one thing i could change and that is the sluggish start from first gear, but that can be fixed with a few modifications to the stock model. Nonetheless this car is super fast! I was running at 115mph in fourth gear and when i hit 5th it was barely past 3500rpms. The governor doesn't let you meet the cars maximum capabilities. The stock rims are ok, but if you want more women some 17inch chrome wheels are nicer.

In conclusion there is nothing better than my 2000 Ford Mustang. Its a stock and can beat a 2000 GTS Toyota Celica. I paid 16,500 for mine during a great sale Ford had and the dealer was just great. I have great interest rates and paid NO MONEY DOWN. It doesn't get better than that. Gas mileage is not bad. Great sound out of this engine with 190hp output it doesn't get any better. The styling on this car is impecable. I love the new lights on it. The rims i got changed on it and women just love it. Cd player, remote keyless entry and trunk. It is a wonderful car. Great first car. Very fast with good insurance rates. No car like it. Used to hate Ford before I got in this baby, One of A Kind!!. Get it in the new Atlantic blue color it is the nicest color they got. Or the yellow, whichever you prefer. Highly recommended with a wonderful blend of styling and performance with a great touch of value. All in one. Buy it baby!! I wish they would give me more stars to rate it as because five just doesn't do.
