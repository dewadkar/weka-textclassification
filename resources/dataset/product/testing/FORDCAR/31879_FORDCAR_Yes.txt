            My wife was in need of a new car, so we went dealer hoping for a week. We test drove several vehicles in the economy class and chose the 4 door Escort ES. It was purchased used in 1999 and had 40,000 miles. The car is a very nice bright red with camel colored interior. So far it has given us no problems and never fails to start in either temperature extremes! 

The Escort is a small economy car and you feel it next to other vehicles. It has very good road characteristics and fuel economy. Average economy is 25 mpg balanced between highway &amp; city driving. The fit and finish are very good and the styling is pleasant to look at! The car came with AM/FM cassette player, power steering, driverï¿½s only remote power door lock, remote trunk opener, automatic transmission and steel wheels with plastic wheel covers. 

Regular maintenance is performed by myself and all fluids are easy to check. The location of the oil filter is a joke! The ride and handling is pretty good for a lightweight car. Road noise is high as is engine noise. A little more firewall insulation would have cured this. The Escort handles well on the highway, even with high crosswinds! A good set of aftermarket tires cured the road feedback &amp; handling of the car. 

So far we've put on 24,000 miles with only scheduled maintenance performed. The car is great for shorter drivers 5'10&quot; and under. If your taller you will suffer on long drives due to lack of legroom! The seats could use a touch more firmness, but have decent support. The cup holders are far from being useful! As a matter of fact, their great for dumping over what ever you place in them! Ingress and egress are fine for front &amp; rear seat passengers, except for the taller driver!

We look forward to keeping the car for a while and are very pleased with purchasing it.
