            My fianc� and I own a 1999 Mustang Cobra Roush. Now wouldn�t you want to keep a car like that in the best shape possible? Well we do. We have taken that car in for so many warranty fixes it is not even funny. That car has been at the dealership longer than it was ever on the for sale lot. It has always been minor things that needed to be fixed but when we got it back there was always something else that needed to be fixed that was fine before we dropped the car off. We took it in because the headlights had water spots in them� We get it back and it has the same problem. Finally after two tries they get them fixed. The latest sob story is that the car being a specialty car you�d think that they would do their best to take car of it and not let anything happen to it. NOPE� We have special Roush rims on the car. The car went in for brake work which turned out not to need fixing at all. They were wrong again. While taking of the rims (this was the first time they had ever been off the car) the made what is called �Pressure Rings� in each lug nut hole. Now I�ve talked with the Service Manager at Bill Pierre and he said �We taped the socket so it wouldn�t make any scratches� I in turn told him �That�s good but there isn�t any scratches� There is pressure rings for the impact gun.� He still insisted that these were there before. Which isn�t true. I personally clean that car with my fianc� and I know they weren�t there. To make a long story short. We are stuck with for rims that all have these marks on the rims and even after showing them a before picture and them going over the car them selves they still wont replace them. 

This is a friendly reminder that weather or not it is Bill Pierre or any other Ford dealership they are not on your side. They are all about the money just like any other business. The rule �The Customer is Always Right� doesn�t apply anymore. 

Beware or you too will get screwed.
