            If stealing is a crime then Harley Davidson and Ford should be arrested. Because all they are doing in this case is disguising a regular F150 super crew cab truck with all the Harley Davidson hardware.

First off, they automatically slap an additional $5,000.00 to $10,000.00 on to the regular price tag. Before you even purchase it. They are very firm on this price. Just because it says Harley Davidson on it they think they can charge the customer the extra money. It's not bad enough that they are already charging so much for a regular F150 but then they try and take us for more. I am not saying that the truck is bad, but the way they are trying to make money off of us should be a crime.

Now if you wanted to order a 2001 edition, you have a long wait. Since they are only making 1200 vehicles for 2000, you either have to buy one of the ones on the lot or order a new one. Just to let you know there are reports that they only have four of these models per dealership. If you buy on of these you have to put down a thousand dollars and wait 8 months for delivery. You have to think to your self is this truck with the name Harley Davidson on it really worth all the fuss. Just remember that this is only a F150 truck. No performance difference what so ever.

The only reason that I was trying this one out is because I actually went in to drive the Ford Lightning, that is when I noticed the Harley Davidson Edition of the F150. I test drove this particular model and found it to drive extremely well. There was no hesitation on take off. I hardly felt any bumps in the road. It was a very smooth ride.

Being that this was a Harley Davidson Edition it does have a few cosmetic extras such as there is a Harley Davidson emblem on the front fenders and chrome exhaust pipes. Also any thing that is made of chrome on it or inside it is Harley Davidsons property. There is more, the runners and the little chrome inside such as the seat lever and other little pieces. There is a little (and I mean little) decal on the dash, plus the chrome rims, they are very expensive. Also there is a bed liner that has Harley Davidson embossed on it, this also adds to the price. This truck also comes with the Harley Davidson leather seats. These seats have the soft leather and are very comfortable to sit in. None of this adds to the performance, to better the truck.

The one that I drove was black on black and was fully loaded, which included a cd player, am fm stereo radio. Tilt, cruise control, power steering and 4 wheel disc brakes. This also had a 6 cylinder, 4.2 liter engine. This is 205 horse power, and also gets almost 20 miles to the gallon of gas. That's pretty good for a truck. They also have visor vanity mirrors. I would not try and work on this truck cause you could not get your hand in anywhere to do any work.

The average price for a regular F150 truck is around $28,000.00 fully loaded. So you can see how much they jack up the price just because of the name. Don't get me wrong, Ford does make a very good truck. The warranty is very good, and they last a very long time. But what all you Harley fans have to decide is whether or not the name is worth all that extra money.

So in conclusion, I can say that I would recommend the F150 truck but not the Harley Davidson edition. Because all they want is your money and they are not worried about the customer. And in the end the customer is the one who gets it in the END! I myself would not buy this truck cause of the expense to replace anything on it would be so outrageous you would go bankrupt trying to fix it. But maybe a Harley Davidson fan might. If they have that kind of money.<br><br>
