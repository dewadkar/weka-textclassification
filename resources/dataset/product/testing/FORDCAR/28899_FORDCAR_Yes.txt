            We bought our Explorer used.  It's a l993 model.  We've put over 50,000 miles on it. It's been great mechanically. We live where the weather gets rough in the winter.  We haven't had any problems with it going on snow. It has plenty of leg room for me and I'm 5'l0&quot;.  Ours even has room in the back for hauling. Ours has more room in the back than my sister-in-laws' blazer.  Higher up too. Ours has four doors, which is great with two small kids.  I don't have to reach over the seats to put them in their safety seats.  It handles great.  Even though we don't travel at high speeds.  We rarely travel on the interstate.  

The drawbacks.  This vehicle rides rough.  Living up a dirt road, we take a beating.  I have to get the wheels aligned often, I think because of this.  It's really puts wear on tires.  It has problems with mechanical things.  I don't think its just because of the age of the vehicle.  The door handle came off, will cost over $300 to get the panel.  I keep gluing it back.   The electronic mirror switch doesn't work right.  Both mirrors turn left and up, but not right and down.  The dealership mechanic said it was probably the motor,  which would be expensive. They replaced the mirror cable because of a recall.  I hoped that would fix it, but it didn't.
We had to replace the blower motor for the heater.  Because the other one messed up, the switch only works on high.  
Even though the back seat isn't real comfortable, it still has lots of leg room.  We just have the two kids safety seats back there right now. When I do sit back there, I can see over the driver seat.  Which is great.
