            I bought this truck after *exhaustingly* researching and driving numerous other 4WD vehicles...Namely the Jeep Cherokee Sport, Subaru Legacy and Forester, Nissan Xterra, and Ford Escape. Basically, I wanted a fairly inexpensive 4WD vehicle to get me through the lovely, central NH winters. I test drove all the aforementioned, except for the Xterra (I quickly ruled that out thanks to this site).

The model I ended up leasing was the 2001 Ranger Edge SuperCab, fully loaded...4.0 L SOHC V6 w/ 207 HP, 6 CD in-dash changer, cruise control, 4WD, fog lights, side steps, 16" Firestones, etc., etc., etc...Every options Ford offers.

All I can say is...THIS THING ROCKS!

I've had it since October, and it continues to amaze me on a daily basis. I've had no problems at all, and it runs beautifully in significant amounts of snow. The pickup on this thing is amazing for a "little" truck (it sits as high as a 2001 F-150, so I don't really consider it a little truck).

<b>PROS:</b> Engine size and HP (acceleration is amazing). 6-CD in dash changer. Road clearance is significant with the 16" tires. VERY comfortable on long trips. Lack of upholstery inside makes it a cinch to clean, while still maintaining a nice look. VERY sharp looking. Rides extremely smooth on the highway (75 MPH+). LOTS of interior room. Interior is intuitively and nicely designed.

<b>CONS:</b> Highway noise is considerable, but not too bad. CD changer is slow, but what can you expect for in-dash? It's hard to find accessories as of yet. Gas mileage (started out at 17 mpg highway, but am now down to 14-15 mpg).

All in all, I would recommend this for anyone wanting a fairly inexpensive 4WD vehicle, or someone looking for a truck with a lot of bang for the buck. I was a little skeptical of giving up the room a SUV would have afforded me, but you can fit two normal sized (5'8"-6') people in the extended cab rear seats pretty comfortably (although not for long trips...Two kids can fit very easily)...There is PLENTY of cargo room if there are no passengers and the seats are folded up.

This truck is an all-around dream, and it looks mean...You will turn a lot of heads in this thing, no doubt about it. Ford did their homework, and turned out an amazing vehicle.

I truly went to the dealership wanting a 2001 Escape. However, after driving the two vehicles, I can honestly say that the Edge has it all over the Escape (V6). Furthermore, the Escape, despite being almost $3000 less in overall cost, would have meant monthly payments of $150-$175 more! Which is one of the best reason's to buy the Ranger...The financing for this vehicle beats any other vehicle out there on the market.

As if you can't tell, I highly recommend this vehicle for just about anyone.

The Edge is still running very strong. My gas mileage is back to around 17/18 mpg. Something that caught me off guard was the gas tank size specification. All of the documentation suggests that Ranger SuperCabs come with the 19.5 gallon tank. Not so...This baby has a 15 gallon tank (talk about a pleasant surprise when I filled up the first time!). I typically get about 235-245 miles per tank before it's time to refill.

It handled the winter up here fantastically (and OH, what a winter it was...I still have 10 foot snowbanks and it's almost May!). The Edge can handle 1 1/2 feet of snow and barrel through 8 foot plow-induced snowbanks with ease (hehehe...gotta' love those plows!). I've had no problems whatsoever, and would still recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a quality 4WD ride. I'll update this if anything changes.
