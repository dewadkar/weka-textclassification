            I have driven a few of these and I was very impressed at this family car. They were both five speed manual transmissions with the V-6. Both were extremely responsive and smooth riding cars. 

I found one odd thing though they had the pull up lever for reverse and I have only seen that on the Corvettes. I might be missing something here but I have no clue what the point to those are, besides you can't shift into reverse by accident but hey lets be honest if thats a problem you might want to purchase an automatic. 

The car rides very tight and yet very comfortably. The interior was very nicely done as far as putting all of the goodies in reach of the driver. The exterior resembling the taurus is looking modest. 

I believe the price is in a fair range for the durability of a family car but the feel or a sports car.<br><br>
