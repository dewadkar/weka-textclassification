            I love my ford Festiva...its perhaps the most reliable car my family has ever encountered! my dad has a festiva too.
   This car has the best gas mileage ever around 52 miles per gallon I assume...I fill up this car about once every 3 weeks..and I drive it everyday to college, and guess what? no problems.  There was a slight problem when i got in car wreck...we fixed up the car! and WOW! it was like good as new! 
   They stopped making this make of car..(which is a supreme disapointment) but this is the most reliable car I ever owned...and I recommend everyone get a festiva! <br><br>
