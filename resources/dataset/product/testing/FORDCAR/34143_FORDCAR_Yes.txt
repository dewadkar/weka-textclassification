            My Ford LTD Crown Victoria Wagon, which I purchased new in 1989, is the best car I have ever owned.  It has 8 passenger capacity, holds a 4ft wide piece of lumber between the wheel wells in the back.  Has a hidden 9 cubic foot storage compartment when the rear most seats are not needed for passengers.  I can go from 8 passenger seating to 8ft flat floor in the back without having to remove the seats, just fold them down.

I get 15 mpg around town.  20+ mpg on trips without my trailer.  Towing my 21 foot full size travel trailer is no strain and I get 11 mpg.

Too bad they don't build anything this good today.  Most anything that would tow my trailer in today's market gets significantly lower fuel economy and holds less that 8 people max.

Plus, you do not need a running board to get in and out.  When I need to cart someone in a wheelchair, the seat height of the front seat is level with the seat height of most standard wheel chairs.  This fact makes it easy to transfer a passenger from the front seat to the wheel chair and back again.

I have 140,000 miles on this car and plan to keep it as long as I can keep it running.<br><br>
