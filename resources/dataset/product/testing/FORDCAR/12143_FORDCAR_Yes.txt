            I did a lot of research before I purchased my 1999 Ford F250 Super duty Turbo diesel pickup. I had owned an 1993 Ford F250 diesel w/regular cab and needed to upgrade to a club cab. I read all the hoopla about the new engine in the 1999 truck and about all the new improvements to the overall truck.
Let us get to the good news first.
The truck rides great, my first long trip was 560 miles and I drove all the way, when I got to my destination I felt great.
The rear seat in the extended cab is not too uncomfortable, in fact on several trips I have ridden back there for several hours,(3 to 4). Plus with the ride of the truck it is easy to lay across the seat and get some sleep. I must add that I weigh 265 lbs.
The truck runs good on the open highway especially on level ground. If you can keep up the rpm's above 1900 it runs good on hills.
The bad news next.
The fuel economy is not what I had expected. The reviews of this truck touted the new improved engine to give better performance and better fuel economy. One Ford dealer tried to tell me that he had sold a truck to an individual that has had a lot of Ford diesel and this person told him that he was getting 30 MPG on a trip.
I didn't believe him then and did not buy my new truck from that Dealership.
I am only getting 17mpg with a standard 6 speed transmissions and no load and only if I keep the speed at 55MPH. When I get on the interstate the fuel economy drops to 16 and if there are many hills or mountains, such as West Virginia it will drop down to 14.5 mpg. Towing a 3500lb boat the truck drops to 10mpg.
I compare this with my 1993 Diesel on the same roads which i would get was 18mpg at all times and I would get 20mpg when I could get the higher cetane Diesel Fuel. Towing the same boat I would get no less than 11 mpg
Also with the 1993 the truck would maintain same speed on large hills while towing and would recover more quickly.
Other nuisance trouble.
The engine takes 14 quarts of oil.
The oil filter is impossible to take off without dropping it or spilling the oil all over yourself.
The fuel filter needs changed every 15000 miles and the first time I had to purchase one I had to get it from a Ford Dealer @ $64.50. The one listed in the owners manual is wrong.
You have to add an additive to your antifreeze at 15000 miles and you have to have it checked at certain intervals, The additive is $8 a bottle and the test strips are 4 for $5 at the right place.
I had a clunk underneath and it took 3 trips to the dealer to fix.
I have a small crack in the windshield that was there 2 days after I bought the truck. 3 trips to the dealer and they refused to fix it.
The truck stalls too easy, I was told that the truck would adapt to my driving, It hasn't.
I went to rotate the tires @ 5000 miles and couldn't get the wheels off.
Then at 10000 miles I had to place a jack between the tire and the frame to get one tire off.<br><br>
