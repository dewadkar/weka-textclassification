            I bought my 1996 Ford Bronco, because it combined the SUV 4x4 element with a nice car type feeling.  Our Bronco XLT 4x4 has an excellent combination of power and elegance.

When you compare the price of the bronco with other vehicles of the same substance you find the price significantly lower on the Ford Bronco. One of the things I like the best about that is not only is it less expensive, and not at a loss for any elements, but the trade in value or resale value is excellent!

The ride is so smooth, and I have made many long trips in the vehicle. Frequent trips for Chicago to Houston are made easier because of the smooth ride.  The options on the XLT are too numerous to mention but pretty much everything you can think of is in there except a sunroof, which I wouldn't want in an SUV anyway!

We've also used the Bronco for hauling our 2 horse trailer and it handles great in that aspect as well.

So mix the ride comfort of a cadillac and the fun aspect of a Jeep and you end of with the Bronco!
I love it!

The only drawbacks to the Bronco that I would say exist is the difficulty of getting into the back seat.  The front seats slide up but there is little room and a large step up to get into the back, even with the running boards.

If you are using the Bronco as a family vehicle many car seats don't seem to sit real well on the rear seat. While i'm sure it conforms with all legal standards, I don't like it.  I prefer to have the car seat in the front passengers seat which isn't supposed to be a safe, but it seems more stable there.

The only other drawback i have found is that it really consumes some gas.  $5 in the tank won't get you very far, but on a long highway drive the mileage improves.<br><br>
