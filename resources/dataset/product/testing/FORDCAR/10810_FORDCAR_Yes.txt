            In all my life, I never saw me as the Van driving type.  First of all, I thought it's way to big for me to drive, I would have a very hard time manuvering it.  I also thought I was way to cool for a mini van!

Well, times are changing!  I am a mommy of 2 now and the regular size cars were no longer fitting my needs. My husband wanted to get one of those HUGE bulky full size vans!  I told him no way was I ever going to drive one of those!  I compromised and agreed to a Ford Windstar!

I can't beleive I am going to say this, but I actually LOVE this car!  Driving this, you would never know it was a mini van!  To me, it drives just like a car. I don't feel like I am driving a hunker of a car that takes everything out of me just to turn it.  And I have no problems making it into parking spaces.  That was another thing I was worried about.  Not being able to get into parking spaces!

Some of the features of my Windstar is separate controls for the front and back of the van as far as A/C and heat.  I can turn on the blower and the person sitting in the back seat can decide how much or little they want it to blow.  I also like that fact that there is a headphone plug in for the radio in the back.  This way, when my kids get older and I don't want to hear the kind of music they are listening to, they can plug this in and listen to it themself.  There is even a radio contol in the back for them to put the radio station on what ever channel they want.

The thing I like most about this van is the room.  When I am getting my kids into their car seats, I can practically stand up inside the van while doing this!  Big plus for me!  I hated leaning over and trying to get the kids in, in a regular size car.

The only thing I would have done different when buying this van was to put a second sliding door on the drivers side and also put a remote control with it.  I would give anything to not have to put my child down just to unlock and open the door!<br><br>
