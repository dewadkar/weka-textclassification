            After driving my previous car for twelve years, I had to consider buying a new one.  I had liked Escorts ever since I had rented one on vacation back in 1987, and vowed I would buy one should I ever need a new car.

I have a 1996 Ford Escort Wagon, and I love it.  About a month after I bought it, I went on vacation with it.  There were two other people with me, and we had more than enough room for everyone's luggage, plus we liked the fact that we could pull the &quot;shade&quot; over everything so it couldn't be seen.  We felt our things were safer that way.  The luggage rack on top frequently comes in handy for transporting things too large to put in the car.

The gas mileage was great.  On that first trip, we went 1,296 on $35.00 worth of gas.  That's pretty darn good in anybody's book.

Driving an Escort is a lark!  It's smooth and comfortable.  My Escort is a standard transmission, and the gears shift very smoothly.  I read in another review in Epinions that you shouldn't buy an Escort unless you like changing headlamp bulbs.  I've not changed one in two years.

In closing, we all liked my Escort so much after that vacation I mentioned above that my two fellow vacationers bought them one, too!

I think an Escort is ideal for anyone.  My 78 year old mother just bought a new wagon, and she loves it. The wagon would be good for a family, too.

Driving my Escort, I feel very sophisticated.  I know it's a good car, and a good buy for the money, plus it looks good.  As I said, what's not to like?
