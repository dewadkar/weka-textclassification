            I have a 94 Explorer with 130,000 miles which is the best car I have ever owned in almost fifty years. I normally would not keep any car past 75000 miles. Because of this I was attracted to this new offering by Ford which is lighter and faster and which offered us a replacement for our 92 Honda Civic. We needed more power and more space with the same reliability. CONSUMERS REPORTS shows that over the past twenty years or so the reliability spread on cars from all over the world is converging to a common value range that makes reliability less of a significant criterion than it used to be. We drove the Honda CRV, the Mazda Tribute, and crawled around in the Toyota RAV4. The Honda was underpowered, although still a high quality Honda product. The Mazda Tribute which uses the same drive train as the Escape was OK but was not a decisive winner over the Escape. We did not like the Mazda dealership we went to but could have found another. The Toyota RAV4 was attractive, but does not have the interior space we needed. The Escape was fast, nimble, comfortable, well appointed, and good looking. Its cargo area is about a foot shorter than the Explorer, but ample for almost any need. Its tailgate door and window arrangement is the best for any situation we have come across. The method of folding down the rear seats to get more space seems to be the same on all small SUVs but the Escape creates a flatter bed than most.
