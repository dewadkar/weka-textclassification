            I bought my Ranger from my step mother a year ago, and have loved it ever since. The truck is virtually maintenance free. A trip to it's favorite lube shop once in a while is all it has asked from me.  The only work that has been done to it is the brake pads and one headlight, and that's after 160,000 miles!

The only downfalls of this truck is the cabin space and power. I have found it is great for one person, but it isn't a family vehicle. The engine isn't that powerful either, so I wouldn't use it for off road expeditions.  I have stuck mine in sand twice, not bad considering the abuse I have put it through. I will buy another one in the future.

great buy, sorry Chevy!
