            After deciding that a family of 4 just wasn't going to fit into a Thunderbird anymore, we went minivan shopping. We tested every American made minivan available and happily decided on the Windstar. I am extremely pleased with our purchase! It looks beautiful, it's extremely comfortable, it's easy to get in and out of, and we've not had any problems with it whatsoever.

We didn't think we'd like having both sliding doors, but they are such a convenience. We put the toddler in her carseat on onside and our pre-teen climbs in on the other. The front seat armrests raise up, so if I need to reach back to the toddler, I can with ease. We have front and rear air and heat, so the kids can get warm (or cool) just as quickly as the driver.

The Windstar is the safest minivan and we feel very safe and confident riding in it. The seats are easy to put in and take out, and we have an option to take out the middle seat and move the back seat up, giving us seating and cargo space.

The instrument panel is easy to read, the van is easy to drive and I would recommend this van to anyone considering a minivan. There is an option to have a tv/vcr/game system installed. We don't have that option, but it is available for those who would like it.

All in all, this is the best vehicle I've ever driven or owned.<br><br>
