            So you�ve finally broken down and decided to buy a new car, that beat up old Honda Accord from 1988 isn�t doing it for you anymore, and while the three-colored motif may turn you on, it can hardly be considered a chick magnet.  Given your experience with older cars, you decide that the only way you�ll spend any money on upgrading you mobility is to go with a new car.  That�s it!  While you do your shopping, don�t overlook ford�s newest entry into the compact car category.  First introduced overseas in Europe, the Focus won their equivalent �Car of the Year� award; and repeated this feat after being introduced in the US in the year 2000.  If that doesn�t impress you right off the bat, I�ll try to give you more of a reason to pursue this automotive accolade.  
Let�s focus first on the engine, the first thing that a buyer might look at if sportiness is a priority.  One thing I didn�t quite like about the car is the fact that the only option for the engine is to go with a 2.0 liter V4, which doesn�t make for a great deal of power on the open road, but does attain an impressive 26MPG in the city and 31MPG for country driving.  Granted, with the size car we�re dealing with, it doesn�t make for a bad ride, in test-driving this car I found I could still overtake most any care comparable to the focus in size and engine capacity.  It is a delightfully smooth and quiet ride, however, there is no noticeable vibrations while driving, even at higher speed, and in my experience with it, the car cornered exceptionally well, stopped very quickly.  Overall, the ride this car gives you will leave you wanting to take the long way home.  
The interior of the Focus came studded with things like a CD player, power windows, locks, mirrors, air conditioning, and cup holders (all in SE model) among other things.  All this comes for under $14,500, which is quite a bargain.  Focus comes with one of the most spacious trunks of any car in it�s class, with a split backseat, either side of which will fold down for extra cargo room (which means all you skiers out there need not fear, you�ll be able to tout around your K2�s just fine).  The only negative aspect of the interior that I found was that I felt a little cramped, the car could feasibly be 6 inches wider and give the added bonus of some elbowroom without too much trouble.  I must admit being a little surprised when I stepped into the car, it looks larger on the outside than it proves to be on the inside.  However, if a five-person family car isn�t your main concern, there isn�t a lot to worry about, it�s plenty spacious for two people and some luggage.  The Focus also comes with some nice safety features: dual airbags and a shift-lock among these.  Focus also requires one of two special keys provided by the dealer to start the ignition.  A computer chip is embedded in the key that tells the car that the proper driver is behind the wheel.  Duplicates can be made at your local hardware store to open doors, but if you need replacement keys you�ll find yourself shelling out in excess of $30 per key, so make sure you have a reliable key chain!
All in all, in turning the lens on Ford Focus, I find it to be a great value, if a somewhat compact automobile that I would be pleased to make my own.  The many pros to owning this automobile far outweigh, in my opinion at least, the need for more elbowroom, which is really my only serious complaint about the car.  Ford Motor Company has my blessing to keep producing these quality automobiles well into the future!
