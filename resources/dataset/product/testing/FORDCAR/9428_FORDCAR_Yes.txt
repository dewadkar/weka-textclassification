            Introduction: My car is a 2003 GT-Premium, with an 5 speed manual transmission. It has the interior upgrade package and the 17' bright wheel package. It also has the "standard" Mach 460 sound system. Thus, the only other option was the Mach 1000 stereo package.

Engine/Power: This car is fantastic and fun. It is definitely a street competitor in its stock form. If you are even more serious about speed then there is an endless array of modifications and upgrades available for this vehicle. For those of us who like to remain out of both jails and hospitals the engine provides more than enough power. This power is available throughout the RPM band with maximum HP (260) coming at 5250 rpm and max torque (300) coming at 4000 rpm. In laymans terms this means there is always plenty of power, whether it's for the street light drag race or for passing that minivan on the freeway. The engine sounds fantastic from both inside and outside the car and is guaranteed to make you smile whenever the gas is applied. At cruising speeds the engine is exceptionally quiet particularly in 5th gear and yet there is still plenty of power available to pass without necessitating a downshift. Overall I would rate the engine a 9.8/10.

Transmission: I chose the 5 speed manual transmission and though I live in a traffic laden state I am quite happy I did. It really increases the race car feel of the Mustang with the added benefit of not bleeding power from your engine. The transmission itself is not the best I've ever experienced, and though I am by no means a race car driver I can still tell that it could use some refining. The shift from 1st to second feels somewhat awkward and all of the shifts are a fairly long throw. I also feel like 1st gear is more sound than fury. That being said, get to second gear and watch the countryside start to blur and try not to smile. Second gear is where the fun-o-meter rises as fast as the RPM's. 5th gear is tall and definitely for cruising. You could probably get by without it and use 4th all the time but 5th makes the ride quieter and is great if it is a long touring trip. Overall I would rate this a 7/10


Handling/Ride: Mustangs have not always been known as the handling giants of the car world but this is the best handing one of its type I have ever driven. (Obviously excluding Cobra, Saleen etc, which are further tweaked and more expensive) The ride is smooth even though it is a solid rear axle and this is good news for those of us who use it as a daily driver. On the performance side the car performs well. It handles the corners and the steering communicates well with the road. The 245 ZR rated Goodyear rubber all the way around probably helps. (and looks great too) There is traction control which can be disabled with a button on the center console, but is a nice addition if you drive in rain or snow. The disable button is a nice addition if you want to lay a bit of rubber/explore your inner teenager, which everyone likes to do now and again. The ride itself is great. These cars are apparently notorious for squeaks and such, but mine does not really seem to have any. The doors, though large and heavy, but close with a satisfying thunk and lock out road noise. (This is probably helped by the additional insulation Ford added to the 2003 models but I'm glad they did.)And you can drive along in relative silence if you like. The engine note is always present but it is not overbearing and if you wanted to avoid the sound of your engine you wouldn't be buying a Mustang anyway. Overall I would rate it 8/10  

Interior/Comfort: I chose the interior upgrade package to go along with my dark charcoal, leather interior. Personally, I love it. The gauge cluster is well laid out, and easy to read. The cluster is all analog except for the odometer/trip meter and this is the way I like it. There is no worthless LCD's or a gimicky center cluster, just nice gauges that are readable and backlight nicely at night. The steering wheel is the perfect size and does not obstruct the gauges. Everything is laid out well and controls are easily accesable to the driver (or passenger). There are 2 cup holders, vanity mirrors on both sides, plenty of pockets in the doors, electronic drivers seat (passenger is manual), multi-direction adjustable head rests and a center bin with an additional electric outlet. Although these things are probably less a consideration for the "hardcore" Mustang driver, for someone who drives the car every day and has a significant other these are heady features that increase its appeal. The driving position is comfortable and everything is within reach whether you are 5'2" or 6'2". If you are above that things might get a bit more cramped. There is plenty of storage space in the trunk and with the back seats down there is even more. The back seats themselves are best saved for pets, kids or adults who are stranded or too drunk to drive home (assuming you are not). This is not a 4 seat vehicle, but a 2+2, and so is not ideal for a family. That being said I have crammed my 6'7" buddy into the back for a trip home, all be it a very short trip. I do not feel that the interior is cheap at all but there is a liberal use of plastic in addition to the leather. All in all the interior is great, though I recommend the interior upgrade, if only to get the silver racing peddles. Overall an 8/10.

Stereo: This requires a section unto itself because I feel that Ford has really added a nice feature that is not really available on many cars as a standard feature. I have the Mach 460 which is 8 speakers, 460 watts, a six disk in- dash changer and is much more like a custom system than a stock stereo. Yes, you can upgrade to the Mach 1000, but come on, you will be deaf before you leave the lot. In addition the 1000 takes up your entire trunk with amps and 2 ten inch sub woofers. Again, I sound old but in reality the 460 is so much more than you need. You can roll down the windows at 85 MPH and turn up the stereo and be surrounded by a cocoon of music that is crystal clear and still not hear the wind because the music is so loud. Jazz sounds fantastic but you can throw in a little System of the Down, roll down the windows and dust some 18 year old clown off the line on your way to pick up your woman. Overall a 10/10.

Exterior/Styling: It's a Mustang and it has never looked better. I'm still debating the faux scoops on the hood and the sides (as I think stealth is the way to go) but I can't say I hate them. The car has a boxy, muscular profile with big tires and a low stance. It's styling, even with the scoops, is understated, with just a GT badge on each side and the rear and monochromatic paint. YOU MUST GET THE 17 INCH "BRIGHT" WHEEL UPGRADE. This upgrade is essential. It is only 395 dollars and makes a huge difference as the 5 spoke chrome rims give the car an exceptionally refined look especially when compared to the stock rims. This is a car you can take to the country club and have parked in the front but you can drive it without feeling like you are trying to be something you are not. It looks great in any/many colors. Mine is silver and looks great, especially after it gets waxed. The windows could stand to be a bit more tinted and it could be, maybe an inch or two lower (with some improved springs) but overall it looks fantastic and get 9/10.  

This is a fully loaded, race bred sports car, with fantastic styling, incredible engine and stereo and a great interior for under 30,000 even when you buy the extended warranty. ($1200, and now you get 6 years or 78,000 miles)
Subaru WRX or Nissan Altima are about the only things close. The 325 is a ton more expensive and to get the 330 you better be ready to break the bank. This car is, without a doubt, the best all around bang for the buck on the market at this time. Get one before they change the body style and buy a little history in addition to a great sports car.
