                I bought my car about a year ago, used.  It is a 93 Ford Taurus, 4 door, with a v-6 engine.  And It works GREAT!  When people complain about having problems with used cars, I am surprised, because MY used car, that was bought with TONS of miles is still going great, and running smooth, with only one trip to the shop check under its wheels.  
     It is definatly a family oriented car, but yet also has a sporty feel to it.  I am a young mom, and not feeling like I am in an old betty mobile is important, but my first priority is making sure that my car is safe for my son and I.
     So far I have not in any way been proven wrong.  The car is very child friendly, with cleanable seats, and plenty of room for toys and games and strollers and diapers (well you know what I mean) in the BIG trunk!  The car can fit 6 safely and 5 comfortably with the big bulky carseat in the back.  My sons carseat fits in perfectly, and causes no problems for me to get him in and out of it.  And when he grows legs long enough, the car will allow him great leg room!  
    Before I bought my car, I thought that FORD was not a worthy company of my buisness, I can not tell you that I will not be buying another brand of car EVER, but the way things are going now, I am not sure I will ever need to buy another car!<br><br>
