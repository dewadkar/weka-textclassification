                Well, since I wrote my last review I was a Store Manager for a cell phone company here locally and now I have moved on to Ford New Car Sales. Therefore, I hope my epinion is taken seriously because I have a lot of product knowledge.

    The amazing thing about the 03' Windstar is the convenience. Five mothers of Ford came together and designed the conveniences and the safety features so that should tell you something! 

    You have four trim levels to choose from starting with the LX, SE, SEL, and the Limited.

    The LX is perfect if all you want to do is have the space and a minivan, that's all. You have a price that starts at approx. $23,500. However, you can get a LX very nicely equipped depending on the amount of money you want to spend.

    Next is the SE, which I use as a demo right now.  They start at approx. $28,500.  Now you can get them equipped very nicely also, putting you easily above $32,000. The SE has the Captain's Chairs standard and CD player standard and you can get it equipped with a TV and VCR but we'll talk about that in a minute.

    Next is the SEL. That baby starts at approx. $35,800. Most of them come with leather and the Family Entertainment Center. Some come with airbags that come out of the seats. The big difference between the SE and the SEL is the exterior paint. The SEL has a two-tone paint job and the SE has a solid paint job. Both are very beautiful vans.

    Finally, there is the Limited. That beast is awesome. It comes standard with leather, Family Entertainment Package, Side Seat Airbags, and CD Player and Cassetter Player, along with Audio/Video jacks for Game Consoles and standard with headphones. By the way, this Van starts at $38,000.

    You can also get Audio/Video jacks on the SE and SEL.

    Now let's talk about options.

    The options are as follows: You can get it where you can open the sliding doors electronically simply by pushing a button on the inside of the van and key fobs where you can push the button from up to 40 yards and open the sliding doors. You have total control. 

    The Ford Windstar is THE safest minivan in the world. That is a fact from the NHSTA. It is the ONLY minivan that has a QUADRUPLE FIVE-STAR GOVERNMENT CRASH TEST RATING. That means a lot to a person that has a big family.

    The Windstar is also the only vehicle in its class that comes standard with Ford's Exclusive Personal Safety System. I'll tell you a few things about it. First of all the Motor Mounts are made of gel that allows the engine to fall under the vehicle instead of going through it in severe frontal crash. Also it has Crash Severity Sensors located behind the grill letting the computer in the van how severe the accident getting ready to take place is. It only takes it 3 milliseconds. It will determine how hard the airbag should be and how tight to make the chest restraint on the seat belt.

    Listen folks, there are tons more to tell you but you only get the full effect by going to your local dealer and looking at the real thing. They are very impressive vehicles, and for you Dads out there that think you are too cool to own a minivan, well, get in this thing if you have kids and you'll never own car again. I guarantee it. 

    My wife and I just got back from the beach and we took the WIndstar and with a 3 year old and a 9 month old, both boys, the TV and VCR were life savers. You need that on a 7 hour trip. It is the best van ever manufactured and the best part of it all it is made from the best...FORD!

    I hope you have found my epinion helpful and if you have more questions about this van, email me at philnsteph4@earthlink.net.

Thank you!
