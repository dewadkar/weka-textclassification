            Anyone who has recently purchased a car knows that it is no easy thing to do.  When my husband and I decided the time had come to go out and get a car we had no clue where to start.  So we followed a television commercial and ended up at the Ford Dealership.  

We were looking for a 4 door car that got good mileage and was easy to drive.  We needed a car that could easily adapt to 2 very different drivers.  This car was to be able to withstand daily rush hour traffic in Atlanta as well as being able to travel through the mountains of Virginia.

The first car we looked at was the 2000 Ford Contour.  On the test drive it was amazing.  My husband has driven everything from coal trucks to motorcycles and was exstremly pleased with the Contour.  We decided that we wanted it.  Once back at the dealership we were informed that the car had been sold a few minutes befor we went on the test drive.  There had been a mixup with keys and that one wasn't even supposed to have left the lot.  I wasn't pleased about this as they didn't have anymore of that year left.  

The dealer suggested we check out the 1999 version.  I have to say it wasn't much different.  The drive was great.  We've taken it through the mountains and through heavy traffic.  We opted for passenger and driver side airbags, AC, CD player, and a few other extras.  We love the mileage that the car gets and the smooth drive is definately a plus.  The power in that vehicle is perfect for the driving conditions around here.  Having to be able to go from stop to fast is important if you don't want to get run over by another driver.  This car has the power to do that and more.

The sleek design of the car makes it not only a pleasure to drive, but something worth looking at.  The extra protective coating over the paint does wonders to avoid those little scratches that come from rocks in the road and such.  With interior lights that stay on for a few minutes after you turn off your car, it definately adds an element of safety for those drivers who must travel later hours.  

I would recommend this car to anyone that is looking for something that not only makes a good family car, but doesn't look half bad for a single person to drive either.  It's not too high to insure either.  <br><br>
