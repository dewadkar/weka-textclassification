            Living in the state of Colorado means needing a car that can handle icy roads and windy conditions.  The Ford Explorer does just that.  Buying this SUV was the best idea my family has ever had.  We tend to travel through the mountains quite a bit and this car has never let us down.  While we would slip and slide all over the roads in our other vehicles, we always feel safe and secure in our Ford Explorer.  We have made many long trips in this vehicle, therefore putting a lot of mileage on it as well.  However, you would never know that we had driven it very much since it still works like new.  

Not only does the Ford Explorer handle the roads well, it also has a lot of room in the very back.  We have fit groceries, bikes, and numerous other things in it that could not have fit if we had used another vehicle.  The only problem is if you sit in the back seat and you have long legs...it just isn't comfy.  Other than that, the Ford Explorer is a great family car and I would recommend it to anyone needing to fit a ton of stuff in the car.<br><br>
