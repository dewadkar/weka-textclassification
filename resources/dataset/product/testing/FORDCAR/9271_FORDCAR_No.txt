            It's really too bad about my Contour. It was an OK price. The car is alot of fun to drive, I have the SE version with the 170 hp V6. But.... I have the reoccuring NO START problem. I go out to start it and about once a month it wont start. Turns over fine but won't catch. I have had it into Ford 7 times now and they can't seem to fix it. I am currently intereing into Arbitration with Ford on it. It's too bad because when it runs it is a blast to drive. Fast as hell, and corners like it is on rails. With the 205 tires that came standard on the SE you can do anything and it will track great. Worst cup holders in the world though, I gave up drinking coffee in it after spilling about 3 fulls cups. Also power window controls suck, they are flush with the door and are very hard to operate
