            I've owned my 1998 Windstar GL for just over two years now.  My previous vehicle was a 1991 Dodge Caravan.  In comparison, The Windstar has much more comfortable seats, and a better ride.  It also feels much more stable than my old Caravan.  The Windstar also has the benefits of anti-lock brakes and traction control both of which have come in handy during the snowy winter months.

My Windstar came equipped with the 3.8 liter V-6.  While this engine has gobs of torque, it sucks fuel down with equal voracity...  In normal driving around town it only gets 17 MPG, and the best it's done on the highway is 20MPG.  I was used to the Caravan's 3.0 liter getting 20 MPG around town and 24 or so on the highway.  The Windstar's gas mileage is in SUV territory.  I even took it in for service and was told that the mileage I was getting was normal.  The 3.0 liter engine may be the way to go for better mileage

Other than the poor mileage, I haven't had any other problems with the vehicle.  It currently has 21,000 miles on the odometer.
