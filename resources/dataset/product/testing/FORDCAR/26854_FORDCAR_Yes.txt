            I first heard about this vehicle by word of mouth and I figured I might as well take a look at it.  I went to my local Ford dealer and test drove it.  I fell in love with it the moment I heard the V8 Triton engine rev up.  When you drive this vehicle, it's like walking on water, it's so incredibly smooth.  The roominess of this truck is so comfortable, it's almost unbelievable.  Some major pros about this vehicle is that although it rides like a car, it has the benefits of a truck, like being higher, and feeling safer.  I truly recommend this vehicle to anybody.  This vehicle is perfect for large families who want to get rid of the stereotypical mini-van family and want to explore the world in their new Expedition.  The Ford Expedition is the best vehicle for your money, hands down!<br><br>
