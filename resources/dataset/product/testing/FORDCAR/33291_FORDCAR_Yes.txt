            I test drove this car twice before finally deciding to buy it.  Although it is not as luxurious as the car I traded, it has all the features that I really need:  power windows, locks, mirrors, sunroof, security system.  What won me over were the features added to the Mach Audio edition:  HID headlamps and the Mach 500 sound system.  I've seen HID headlamps on both a Lexus and a Mercedes, but never on a car at this price point.  They have an intense beam of bright light and last about 4 times as long as halogen lights.  This edition will be a limited run of 6,000 cars with only 3 color choices.  I went with the Mandarin Copper, which is an awesome color.

Drivability:  The Zetec engine is loud and noisy when pushed to high RPM.  It has decent response, but much slower than my last car (VW with VR6 engine).  You need to downshift and get the engine up to 5,000 RPM to pass another car.  This is when it gets really loud.  Fortunately, the stereo system takes care of that problem.  The handling is superb, better than my Volkswagen.  I really like the Firehawk tires mated to the 16" wheels.  They hold the road well and have good wet weather performance, too.  I want to feel the road underneath me and have that transmitted to the steering wheel.  The Focus does not disappoint in this area.  The only thing that detracts from the handling is the power steering.  It is much too light for my liking. 

Ergonomics:  I am only 5'2", but I have no problem finding a perfect driving position.  The tilt/telescoping steering wheel takes care of steering wheel distance from my chest.  I can also raise the seat to increase my visibility over the dash board.  My husband is 6'3" and he also has no problems finding a comfortable position.  All the controls are in sensible locations and easily reached.

Interior:  The dashboard is very modern looking.  I like it a lot.  However, there is a lot of plastic and it does look like an economy car dashboard.  My Volkswagen had felt-like trim on the A pillars and headliner, real wood trim and a higher grade of plastic on the dashboard.  If you are looking for luxury, you will be somewhat disappointed.  On the other hand, it is still much nicer than all the other economy cars that I've looked at and drove: Honda, Toyota, etc.  The air conditioning vents are well placed and the controls are large and easy to see and use.  The same is true with the stereo controls.

Sound System:  The 10" subwoofer in the trunk provides a nice bass response.  I can crank it up and feel it in my seat.  There are two separate 230 watt amplifiers that are also mounted in the trunk.  The four speakers in the car have good high end range, but they don't sound as good in the middle range.  Guitar heavy pop and rock sounds a little muddy, but synthesizer dance pop sounds incredibly good.  The car came with a CD wallet that holds 10 CDs and the dash-mounted changer holds 6, so that gives enough variety for long road trips.
