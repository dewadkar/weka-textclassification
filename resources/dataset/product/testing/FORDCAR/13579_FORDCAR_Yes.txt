            My wife and I purchased a used 1998 Chrome Yellow Cobra Convertible in Feb 2001. The car was in great shape and had only 22,000 miles on the clock. I had liked Mustangs since I purchased my first back in 1991, (which I drive every day to and from work), so the Cobra had a special meaning to me.

The car has been great. We got an extended warranty and the remaining 3 year/ 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty from Ford. In the 10 months we have been driving the car, we have had no real mechanical problems to speak of. The steering wheel and driver's side seat belt was replaced under warranty for cosmetic reasons. This may have been due to the previous owner(s) abuses.

There are a few squeaks and rattles, but considering that it is a used convertible, that is livable. When the top is down and cruising down the highway, you can't hear them anyway. The car has gotten nearly 28 MPG on a road trip, but averages around 20 around town. The fit and finish is good, but the drive train is the real treat.  Ford has rated this car at 305 horsepower and 300 lbs-ft of torque. I had the car dynoed at 262 rwhp and 268 ft-lbs. Not bad for only 281 cubes. I won't post quarter mile times as I haven't figured out how to launch this beast yet.

The engine pulls hard from around 4000 to 7000 (redline). However, getting a good launch from a standing start is not easy. I usually smoke the tires instead of moving forward. In spite of the power, the car is very easy and forgiving to drive. I always smile when I can put the top down and rumble down the road.

The leather seats are very comfortable, but offer little side support under hard cornering. I have yet to really flog it in the turns yet because I have a hard time borrowing the car from my wife, who selflessly traded in a 1995 Honda Accord for this fine example of domestic muscle.
