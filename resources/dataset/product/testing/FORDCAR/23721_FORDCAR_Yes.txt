            While definitely not the most glamorous car to drive, the Taurus wagon is an efficient &quot;soccer mom&quot; car.  After owning the old Taurus wagon model for a few years and having some problems I decided to trade it in for the '99 model and I'm very glad I did.  Driving this car is a very pleasant experience.  I have had no trouble with brakes, acceleration, or, unlike with the old model, the air conditioner/heat. The driver's seat adjusts in many ways so that I can be comfortable when I drive and stay alert.  
  Even though there have been minor incidents in which this car has gotten roughed up, the only injury was done to the exterior appearance of the car.  Even though I've only owned this car for about a year, I am still happy with the fact that I have not had reason to bring it in for any repairs.  After owning the previous Taurus wagon model and a Volvo wagon, I'm glad to say that this is the best station wagon that I've come across.<br><br>
