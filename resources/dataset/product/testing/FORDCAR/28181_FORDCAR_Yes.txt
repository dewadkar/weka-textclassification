            I have had the pleasure over the past couple of years to ride around in one of my family members Ford Taurus.  At first I did not like it but it eventually grew on me and after learning the facts, I realized it was a very good car.  With considerable room in the front as well as the back seats, the car was comforterable to ride in, even for long periods of time.  The car also got excellent gas milage, which is great if you don't have a lot of money to spend on gas seeing as how the prices are so crazy now a days.  I have also read that the car is very safe.  That's good because I feel safe in it.  One thing I did not like though was the radio design.  It looked very weird and odd.  It was not very attractive to me.  Overall this is a good car and is good for famalies and people who travel and are economical.  I would recommend it.<br><br>
