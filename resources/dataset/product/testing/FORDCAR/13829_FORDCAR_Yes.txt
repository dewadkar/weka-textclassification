            I bought my Contour after totalling my first car, and Olds Achieva.  The Contour was used, priced right, and quite frankly the nicest car I could afford.

There are many things I love about my car.  First, the handling.  Everyone mentions it.  I did test drive one with the 14&quot; wheels, but mine has the optional 15&quot; alloys with lower profile rubber.  This gives the Contour another edge but does detract from the ride quality.  Still, I feel it rode better than the other vehicles i tested, the Chevy Malibu and the Dodge Stratus.

The 4 cylinder engine is a mixed blessing.  It does make you feel like you're moving fast, but in reality it's only average.  Most competing 4 cylinder powered cars are much faster and get similiar gas mileage.  I avereage 26 mpg on a 15 mile commute to school.  As it's not a fast car, I opted not to take it on my road trip out to the Rockies.  We took my friend's '98 Prizm because it does have better acceleration and fuel economy.  

My main complaint about the car is interior noise.  It doesn't seem to matter what tires you put on it, there is an aweful amount of tire and road noise at all speeds.  This is my biggest, and only real complaint.  The backseat is smaller than most, but I will never ride there, so I don't care.

Like I said, driving this car is a dream.  it has responsive and nicely weighted steering, great brakes, and I've never driven anything that's better at avoiding an accident.  Countless times this car's handling prowess has allowed me to avoid a serious accident.  The only thing I'd wish for in driving dynamics is more power.

I think this car is perfect for college students, or any single person.  it may be too small if you have a family, but you'd have to take a look at it to find out for yourself.  Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the car.<br><br>
