            Our 1992 Ford 4x4 Xtra Cab v6 4.0Cl Truck was purchased Brand new because we were looking for somthing powerful, yet fun offroad as well as on the road. We purchased the vehicle for around 16,000 and was originaly 20,000. There have been absolutley NO PROBLEMS WHAT SO EVER! The only problem we have encountered was having to repleace a spark plug at one time. Other then that, at 190,000 miles this truck is running clean as can be and still strong enough to take offroading on a whim. What I absolutely LOVE about ford's is their safety, flexability, reliability, and most of all, the performance. These trucks are made to drive far, fast, and hard. I have taken it up to 110 easily and the purr of the engine was beautiful. I recommend this beautiful piece of machinery to virtually anyone.<br><br>
