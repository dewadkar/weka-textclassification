            UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW (3/15/03)
The value of this car just keeps getting better.  I've just crossed 135,000 miles in it, with no serious problems to report.  With the tight budget I'm on, I have no fears about driving this car for several years to come.  It was, and it still is, a very good buy.
____________
We&#146ve had our 1991 Ford Escort GT since it was new.  My dad purchased the car in May of 1991.  I&#146ve been driving the car since 1994, when I turned 16 and Dad got a company car.  Heh&#133little did I know that I&#146d be driving my high school car all through college, and even into marriage!

I&#146ll put it in simply words:  This car was, and still is, worth every penny.  As you would expect in any 10 year old car, it does have it&#146s problems.  The air conditioning no longer works.  It&#146s needed to be charged several times, and needs to be again.  The emergency break cables have been very problematic in this car.  The rear defrost button doesn&#146t work, and the blower motor for the internal air has burnt out.  All that aside, I still love this car!

First of all, the engine has a lot of spunk.  Every person who has ever driven it has told me it has more power than they expected.  If you keep the 1.8 Liter DOHC engine tuned up, and keep your oil changed consistently, I think the thing will run forever.  The engine just purrs.

The car is also a lot of fun on the road.  The GT package has a sportier suspension than the LX models, and you can feel this translate to the road.  This car handles a bit better than my 1999 Grand Am.  For about three years, I drove with slightly oversized tires on the car&#133that helped the handling even more, but I think it rides better with the proper size of tires.  That&#146s what&#146s on it now.

As I&#146ve made the transition from high school, to college, and now professional life, the car has been useful the entire time.  It&#146s helped me through countless moves.  You&#146d be surprised how much you can haul in this car when the backseats are folded down.  That&#146s one real plus about hatchbacks.  I&#146ve also made 10 or 15 trips to Tennessee in the car over the past couple years, as well as a trip to Florida, and two to North Carolina (all from Ohio), and never once did I fear the car would let me down.

In fact, other than the slight problems I&#146ve mentioned above, the car has only really let me down once.  When it passed the 90,000-mile mark, it went through a string of breakdowns.  First, the ignition assembly broke.  Somehow, when I turned the key to start the car, the internal assembly broke, and the car got stuck in &#147accessory&#148 mode.   Then, a few months later, the timing belt broke.  This happened on the interstate, and left me dead in the water.  It was a pretty costly repair.  I also replaced the clutch in the car, after we noticed it begin to slip around the 125,000 mile mark.  Still, these are things that are not uncommon for a car of this age.

Driving a 10 year old car really comes down to a matter of taste.  A person used to brand new cars, where everything works, probably would not like this car.  However, if you are looking for a dependable ride that is a blast to drive, and are willing to overlook imperfections that would plague almost any decade-old car, the 1991 Escort GT is something you should seriously consider.  10 years, and 110,000 miles later, I continue to drive and love mine!
