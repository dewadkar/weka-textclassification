                <b>S</b>ophistication was a major theme for the 1995 Thunderbird Super Coupe. Here is a car with an outstanding chassis and suspension, plus high levels of refinement. The Thunderbird SC, with 230 HP and 330 lb-ft of torque on tap is a luxurious muscle car only a Chevrolet/Monte Carlo (the T bird's Rival) fan of the time period would hate.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

          <b>Once</b> you get past the short-lived active seatbelt system and settle yourself behind the leather wrapped steering wheel, it is obvious that Ford designed the Super Coupe's interior with enthusiastic driving in mind. The Supercharged, modified 3.8 'Essex' V6 has plenty of raw power to rival most V8s. Shift through the gears and you will enjoy acceleration reminiscent of the muscle car era of the 60's-early 70s. Through the turns, the T-Bird SC remains planted, but the fairly slow steering and 'heft' mean considerable driving skill is needed for fast cornering. Compared to the regular T-birds, the SC is a piece of cake to drive, and without needing to say, is much more fun to drive.

<b>T</b>he T-Bird was redesigned from the ground up for 1989 (made Motor Trends car of the year), and built on a new platform called Mn12. The wheelbase was stretched to 113"! The <b>suspension</b> set-up is all new, with short-long arm coil sprung units up from, and a fully rear independent rear axle. The Super Coupe comes with beefy springs, and gas presurized shocks, plus 4 wheel disc brakes! These brakes make this heavy weight stop with confidence while on the twistys, or when coming to a stop light. The 4-wheel discs are a nice addition to this car, the brakes on the regular T-Bird are rather disappointing in comparison.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

        The <b>interior</b> is very roomy, relatively well made leather, good ergonomics, plenty of amenities, plenty of trunk room, plenty of room for adults in the back seat, and 'super supportive' front seats. The instrument panel is very easy on the eyes, at night it reads like a children's story book, but the dash does seem a little dated for a '95 model. The steering wheel is thick, this matches the car's exterior. This steering wheel is wrapped in leather and matched with all the amenities makes this car feel more like a BMW compared to the base models. Because this car is equipped with power everything, you don't have to stretch across the car each time you need to let your friends in.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

 The <b>exterior</b>, is very spacious, and doesn't really look too aggressive, which is to be expected since this car in regular (naturally aspirated 145 hp 3.8 and 190hp V8) form is not a sports machine,. This car is a real sleeper. All in all, looks are fair, you will turn a few heads with this car, but don't expect anyone passing you to start screaming (besides maybe me) "Oh my god its a T- Bird Super Coupe, it's so beautiful." You might want to buy a 2002 model if you want that sort of attention. The T-Bird Super-Coupe comes with sporty body/ground effects to segregate this sports model from the lesser models. 
  
 I don't own this car so I can't comment on <b>reliability</b>, but I do hear this car's engine had head gasket problems from my mechanic. The owner of my tester has not had any problems for me to report to you, other than regular maintenance. The T-bird SC gets around 24 MPG highway, I averaged 27.3 MPG from Fresno CA to Flagstaff AZ, so be prepared to spend an average amount of moo-la on gas. 

<i>Pricing:</i>

 <b>Price:</b> Once, almost 26 grand, the '95 T-Bird Super Coupe can now be had for around 5-10K. A great bargain basement value.
