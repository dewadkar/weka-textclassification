            We bought our tan 1996 Taurus LX wagon used in 1998 with 8,500 miles for $12,750 from my mother-in-law�s estate.  She called it her "catfish", referring to the front body style.  We didn�t need a car critically at the time, but it was too nice to let go on the market at the time.  We knew its history and how meticulously it was cared for from new.     

This car is solid, smooth and comfortable.  The wife likes the easy handling in town, and the car holds the road well at highway speeds.  Our car lacks a CD player, but the LX trim package makes it a very comfortable car in town and on the road.  The 96 and on body style is stiffer than earlier Tauruses we�ve known.  Automatic headlights are nice.  Remote electric door locks are handy.  These features make a car a pleasure to own.  We don't have little kids, so the rear-facing third seat isn't ever used.  A cargo cover conceals things in back if they don't fit in the under-floor storage.  Visibility is good, control is excellent, fuel economy is pretty good, interior appointments are intelligent and well laid-out, maintenance is routine, and we are very satisfied with our 96 Taurus.  

I have the oil changed every 3,000 miles.  That�s more often than the manufacturer�s recommendations, but at about $12.00 per oil and filter change at Firestone (they accept anybody�s coupon), I think it is worthwhile to keep the lifeblood of this 24-valve 3.0 Liter engine clean and fresh.  Now (5/02) with 54,000 miles on the clock, the wife will soon set off to Michigan, and we expect the same trouble-free operation we�ve had to date.  

Looking over the service history, there's little but the numerous oil change receipts.  We�ve replaced the battery twice, but batteries die early in South Florida.  We�re riding on a set of Michelin tires, better of course than original equipment.  Some rotor throb developed, but I had the front rotors turned to fix that.  Brake pad replacement is cheap, quick and easy for an owner.  There have been a couple recall repairs, but otherwise nothing of note.  

One thing I�ve noticed with this and other Fords�the wiper delay can be undependable.  The wiper delay is tied to the low-speed setting and sometimes even in the �low, on� setting things don�t happen right away.  It�s a small thing to cope with perhaps by frequently changing the delay setting during a light rain, but believe me, when you hit a rain squall in mid-Indiana at highway speeds, you want our wipers working immediately and for damn sure.  In that situation, you don�t want some plastic-cam, time-delay driven apparatus legislating on whether and when to start the blades sweeping.  Fortunately, the high-speed setting always gets the wipers moving.   We�re living with it, but FORD SHOULD GET THIS PROBLEM ADDRESSED FROM WHATEVER SUPPLIER PROVIDES THEIR WIPER CONTROL.  This is not a 1996 aberration, but a problem ENDEMIC TO THE MARQUE.   

One thing I don�t look forward to is the eventual sure and certain failure of this car�s many coolant hoses.  They go everywhere around the engine, and some are partially steel tubes, meaning dealer parts.  I meticulously stay away from dealers, as I feel I lose control of the maintenance whenever I had the keys over to a Service Manager.  I�ve read the three other opinions on the car and they indicate concerns about dealer competence and trustworthiness.  Some of the complaints point to the owner not knowing and watching his car as well as he should.  

Changing oil on three cars every 3,000 miles means I�m at Firestone on numerous Saturday mornings; I take a book.  I watch other people making decisions on car maintenance.  One time, I listened to a woman wailing about her car as if spirits possessed it.  What an idiot!  A car is a machine.  It is logic-driven and it is subject to the laws of nature and material failures�usually battery or tire related.  You need to watch it, listen to it, and use your brain.  Firestone sometimes tries to sell air filters, wipers, or brakes in addition to the oil change.  I listen to them, and then if I agree, I go home and replace the things myself.  It isn�t rocket science.    

All in all, we�re very satisfied with our Taurus wagon.  Sure, we sometimes hear a mysterious groan out of the power steering.  The clear-plastic headlight covers are yellowing from the Florida sun.  Sometime it will need struts.  But this car is solid and we plan to drive it a long time.
