                i bought my new 2000 ford aspire on December 15 as an early Christmas present for myself. being in school i didn't have a lot of money to spend on a car, so i choose the aspire. one of the many reasons i bought it was the gas mileage. i can fill up at the beginning of the week and drive for the whole week without having to fill again. that was a plus for me considering my financial situation. i got close to 200 miles on that one fill up. a big change from the 95-100 miles i got in my old 1989 ford escort. i think this car is underrated because of its size. many people over look small cars for what reasons i don't know. in my comparisons the handling is very good compared to full size cars, and parking is a breeze. it has two front air bags and four shoulder strap seatbelts something you don't see in many cars. with the hatch back trunk you have extra room for storage. the clutch is smooth and easy to operate. and the stick virtually slips into gear itself. theres not many things to hate about a car like this. this is a good starter car for someone on a fixed income.
i wouldn't suggest this car to someone with a large family or a very tall person only because of its size.so if you are looking for that first car look into the ford aspire.<br><br>
