            The Ford Superduty exploded onto the market after its introduction in late 1998.  Ford followed a pattern similar to the one Dodge decided to follow when they redesigned the Ram:  create the biggest, strongest, most intimidating truck you can.  Well, it worked, because the trucks were flying out the doors of dealerships and the success translated to Ford�s domination of the work truck market.  

<b>Engine</b>
This was the point that really sold me on the Ford.  The standard engine is the venerable Triton 5.4L V8, which is available in the F-150 and expedition.  However, this engine isn�t anywhere near powerful enough to power a truck with a gross vehicle weight of over 8500 pounds.  The first practical option is the Triton V-10, but I felt that this engine�s torque output is a bit anemic at 310lb-ft.  Thus, I finally settled on the next step-up:  the Powerstroke Diesel.  Just saying the name stirs thoughts of power and brute force, and that�s what this engine produces, no ifs ands or buts about it.  The engine is designed by International, the eighteen-wheeler and tractor people.  It is a turbocharged V-8 which displaces a whopping 7.8L, to the best of my knowledge that�s the biggest engine on the market.  With two extra cylinders and a turbocharger alone, this engine produced close to 400lb-ft of torque.  But in their infinite wisdom, the engineers at Ford decided that wasn�t enough.  The next year they decided to add an intercooler and new fuel injectors to the mix.  The reduced intake temperatures and added fuel pushed torque to a whopping 500lb-ft at 1600 RPM (at the rear wheels!), talk about low-end grunt.  This beast has enough power to pull down a skyscraper if it needed to.  Having so much torque at low RPM�s means that to get maximum pulling power you barely have to put your foot on the gas, no need to tear up the engine with high RPM�s - engine life is longer even under extreme use.  Another engine option I went for was the high output 130 amp dual alternator which allows me to run an under-hood welder and commercial users will love for running tools such as air compressors.  

<b>Transmission and Transfer Case</b>
This behemoth of an engine would have eaten the old transmission alive, so Ford introduced three new transmissions available with the series, the standard five speed heavy duty manual transmission (M5OD), the first ever six speed manual transmission (M6OD), and a new four speed automatic with electric overdrive (4R100).  I finally opted for the automatic based on my constant city driving; but, I would recommend all potential users to seriously consider the six speed manual because of it�s two extra gears which allow for better gas mileage and promises to be much more durable.  All the transmissions, including the automatic can be ordered with a PTO option for running any PTO compatible accessory.  In fact, the automatic is the only auto tranny on the market which can be ordered with a left or right hand PTO to the best of my knowledge.  
The Transfer Case is also a new piece from the people at New Venture Gear, it�s the NVG 271 all aluminum chain driven piece which is surprisingly quiet and has held up to all the abuse I�ve been able to throw at it.  The low range is a deep 2.72, and which combined with the transmission�s first gear and axle ratio combine to give a very low axle ratio.  The standard four-wheel drive system is the tried and true floor shifter and manual locking hubs, which is a model of simplicity.  There is an optional on the fly vacuum actuated hub with a dial that selects four-wheel drive mode.  However, to me that isn�t as aesthetically pleasing as the good ol� floor shifter and with vacuum hubs you never know whether you�ve actually got four wheel drive, manual hubs leave no doubt about that.  

<b>Axles</b>
YES finally another truck with two solid axles.  The Ford F-250 has, standard, a full floating Dana 50 up front.  These axles are thick, with a large nine-inch ring gear and are virtually unbreakable.  If buyers opt for a dually one ton model they�ll get the bombproof Dana 60 which is even bigger and have stronger axle shafts.  If I had my way, the F-250 would at least have the option of a Dana 60, but so far the Dana 50 has held up fairly well.  In the back, the truck rides on a full floating Ford ten and a quarter inch axle.  This axle simply dwarfs the large Dana 50 up front, it�s massive, the name ten and a quarter comes from the size of the ring gear and that�s how big this one is.  The large the ring gear, the stronger it is and the more power it can translate to the wheels.  Parts are so big in this truck, breakage in this drive train is definitely not a problem.  Another great thing about the axles is that users can choose their gear ratio at 3.73, 4.1, or 4.3 (although the Power Stroke Option only allows for a 3.73 or 3.73 and limited slip).  This means that purchasers can choose whether they want power or gas mileage depending on the gear ratio they opt for.  

<b>Suspension</b>
Simple, leaf springs on all four corners, right?  Wrong, maybe out back the setup�s pretty easy but up front a lot of thought and care went into designing the suspensions.  Up front, the truck uses very long leaves and a reversed shackle system (the leaves bow down instead of up like in the rear).  This creates a much smoother ride and helps dampen the enormous diesel engine.  No, it�s not as smooth as IFS, but I�m more than willing to sacrifice a bit of comfort for all the added strength of the solid axle up front.  Admittedly, Dodge has the best suspension system on the market with the coil sprung solid axle front end, but the Ford does perform surprisingly well, and is much better than previous years.  Steering was also improved with a much stronger tie rod and thicker panhard and sway bars, the system works well, but I�d still advise getting the optional steering stabilizer shock absorber to help control especially if the truck�s going to see off road use.  

<b>Odds and Ends</b>
One of the major things which sold me on the Superduty was the mirrors.  That may sound strange, but I tow my boat quite a lot, and in the past it has always been such a chore, worrying if I was about to kill someone unforeseen Joe in a compact in the left lane.  For an extra $55 TELESCOPING towing mirrors can be ordered for the truck.  They�re huge and a godsend with a truck this big, the tops are standard slightly parabolic mirrors, but the bottom are ultra curved and provide unparalleled view of everything happening on the road.  They can be a bit of a pain at the drive through, but are a godsend if you do a lot of towing.  
In the end I think they�re great truck�s they offer a lot of fantastic options for working people who use their trucks hard and subject them to constant abuse.  The Superduty was designed with these people in mind and if sales are any indication, has exceeded all their expectations, I know it has mine.
