            Sporty, sturdy, cute -- that's what I thought when I first saw the Contour on the lot of my local (and thankfully, reputable) used car dealer. 

Overall, I have been very pleased with the gas mileage, drive-ability and passenger room.  Also, the car looks great and *feels* great.  All of the buttons are reachable and the cup holders are a great feature.

Here are the issues:

1.)  The trunk.  It leaks.
     Granted, this may have been the result of an unreported collision by the car's first owner.  
     However, it took me three trips to my local Ford dealer (the car was still under warranty) to fix the problem.

2.)  The recalls.  They're copious.
     Every other day I seem to get a friendly, but pointed letter asking me to bring the car back to a licensed Ford dealer for yet another tune-up.
     While I genuinely appreciate Ford's commitment to their drivers' safety, I wish they would iron out these issues before the cars come to market.  My mechanic and I are becoming best friends!<br><br>
