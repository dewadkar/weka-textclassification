            We needed a new car, We had a Ford Taurus which we loved but it just was not big enough, We started looking into minivans my husband did not want to purchase it  he thought they were unsafe, we did our homework shopped around and we felt that the Ford Windstar was highly rated for safety, and when you carry your most precious cargo (your children) you want it to be safe. The windstar not only looks nice but drives very nice as well I do most of the driving It rides very smooth on the highway and is very roomy for the kids and all there stuff. We did purchase this van used a 1997, and for the last year since we had it we have no complaints not even from husband who does enjoy driving a van now. <br><br>
