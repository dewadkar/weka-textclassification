            I purchased my 1995 Ford Aspire a little over one year ago, used, with about 57,000 miles.  I have driven it about 7,000 miles since, and have kept careful checks on fuel consumption.  
   This is a companion vehicle to the "Freightliner" diesel pickup that I own for 'serious' expeditions.  I use the Aspire mostly to run back and forth to work, around town, and occasionally on 250 mile commutes to pick up my son in a nearby town which is buried in snow 1/2 the year.
   This little car is very good at what it is designed to do.  It moves about town nimbly, parks in a shoe-box space, turns on a dime. With four studded snow tires & front wheel drive, it thinks it is a snowmobile (just don't get ran over-- while it has dual airbags, they will just be more topping on the pizza)...
  It has fairly zippy performance around town with the 1.3 liter engine, manual five speed tranny and the 'no frills' package (no power-robbing air, automatic, etc.) Performance is not quite so good on the open road.  There are several 'flat spots' in acceleration and if you are in one of those ranges, you ain't goin' nowhere fast...However, it is perfectly adequate for normal commuting. 
   Should your driving mainly consist of long stretches of highway driving, you will not be too thrilled with this car.  It is VERY noisy (road noise), especially when speeds increase.  The four new radial tires I just put on helped somewhat, but with 4 studded snow tires for winter driving, it was like riding in a Sherman tank- NOISE!
   Gas mileage varies from about 33-36 mpg around town, to 40-42 mpg on "slow" highway driving (55-65 mph range).  Pushed to 75 mph, gas mileage is around 36-39 mpg. While overall the mileage is very good, I have found that pushing the small engines in these diminutive cars at freeway speeds will usually punish your gas mileage. I have noted with interest that a Buick Le Sabre, for example, with a 3.8L V-6, gets 31 mpg freeway! 
   Some features I like about the Aspire are:
&gt;&gt;  Rear seat folds forward making a good 'golf cart'... with the large hatchback, you can easily load and unload groceries, fairly large boxes, golf clubs, etc..  You give up the back seat, but your little Aspire will readily haul cargo in lieu of passengers.  My choclate lab enjoys riding in the back with the seat folded forward-- he can slobber out the window, or down my neck...
&gt;&gt;  Four adults CAN ride in this car-- I took a 5 hour trip with two large 6'+ guys up front and two smaller girls in the back-- no major complaints.
&gt;&gt;  It has reasonably good interior room for larger drivers.  I am 6'2", 230#, and I have DECENT room inside-- much better arm and shoulder room than many cars in its class, and adequate (barely) legroom for my 35" inseam legs.
&gt;&gt;  It is also good for smaller drivers-- my wife who is about 5'6 and petite enjoys driving the car, too.
&gt;&gt;  With the back seat in the usable position, luggage room behind the seat is considerably better than the other cars in this class (Metro, Suzuki Sprint, etc.)
&gt;&gt; Interior appointments, while not lavish, are adequate.  Upholstery is nice, the gauges are laid out well, there are cupholders (but you lose the ability to have cupholders and plug a power cord in the cig lighter at the same time,as the cupholders will not work with the ashtray open).
&gt;&gt; Driving comfort is not all that bad for a small car, overall.  While this ain't no luxury sedan, it is a decent ride for a runabout.
&gt;&gt;  There is not a heck of a lot to go wrong with this car mechanically.  Mine had a bad wheel bearing when I bought it, which I had repaired; otherwise, oil changes have been the extent of maintenance.  I believe mechanically this little car should run a good long time with proper maintenance.
      In summary, buy this car if you want a cute, inexpensive commuter car. I bought this car because it is CHEAP to operate, not bad to look at, and would be a good around town car as opposed to driving the big truck about town.  To that end, it has not disappointed me.  I like the car.  
   However, I will likely be selling my Aspire and moving up a notch to a car with a quieter ride, a bit more room, and definitely air conditioning and automatic transmission.   
   But if you are after a good first car for your son or daughter, a cheap way to get to work, or just an extra car to run around town in, the Aspire comes recommended.
