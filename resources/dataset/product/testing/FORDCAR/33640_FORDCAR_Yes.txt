            When my sister told me that she was buying a Ford, my gut reaction was, &quot;EWWWWW, *WHY* a FORD????&quot;  I had always heard bad things about Fords in general, and I really didn't have the time to pick her up on the side of the highway three times a week if her Ford lived 'down' to my standards.  Call me selfish, but hey, I am a busy girl!  I was VERY surprised that, two years later, the Ford Escort was still running great without a problem in sight.  I usually hate being wrong, but in this case I am glad that I was!

Her spunky Ford Escort is both cute and practical.  It is great for our weekly mall trips sans children when we want to look carefree and perky.  It is great when we drive to the coast, children packed in like little sardines, and it fits in perfectly with all of the bulky minivans at my nephews soccer games (Go Brian!).  The stereo is just right for Santana and Dixie Chicks (hey, our music taste spans from reggae to rock), and the truck is big enough to hold the stroller, 349914696 bags from Gymboree, and 392469 bags from GAP.  It gets good gas mileage, has four doors, and above all it is practical.  No bells and whistles means less stuff for her demons (did I say that?!) to break.  I love this car.

If you have three or less children, this is the car for you.  All I could ask for is a sunroof....but I am spoiled :)
