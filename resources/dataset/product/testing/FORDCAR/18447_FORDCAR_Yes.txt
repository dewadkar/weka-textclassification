            Hi again everyone and thank you for reading my opinion! I bought a Ford ranger XLT compact pickup in may of 1999. I am a big man. I wear a 54 in a jacket a 40 waist and a 3x shirt! Iwas a little concerned about the roominess I would be sacraficing buy buying a compact truck. I have my wife and a 10 year old daughter to fit in also.

When I first saw the truck, I fell in love with the body style! The outside was areodynamic and the head and tail light assemblies and chrome seemed to melt together. I was a previous owner of a F-150. This truck accommadates two large people very comfortably. The controls are mounted very thoughtfully in the center with all buttons and controls within easy reach. The stereo is a cassette player with AM/FM radio with good sound for factory installed speakers. The intermittent wipers are convenient as are the light controls that are conveneintly located on the steering wheel column.
The four cylinder engine is peppy and has great take off (I have a manual transmission). The gears change very smooth and the engine performance is not hampered by air conditioning or heat. The cruise control is accurate and the air conditioner will FREEZE you to death! The heat warms quickly and the ventilation defrost in approximatly 1-2 minutes.

The conveneince features are a sliding rear window which is fun!, two cup holders located on each side of the gear shift, reclining sport seats with comfortable velour, a convenient console that has ample storage, including slots that hold your cassettes and you spare change for tolls and drinks(nickles, dimes, and quarters). A bedliner protects the bed of this truck and Ranger logo mudflaps all the way around compliment the trucks appearence. The chrome step bumper and chrome front bumper combined elegantly together to add to the overall appearence of this truck. One final thing, This cute little truck has three power plug ins so you can have your radar detector, your cell phone, and your computer without ever needing two or three way adapters!

The reliability and service record for this truck speak for themselves! Keep the oil changed, fill it with gas and keep good tread on your tires and this little jewell should give you no other expense. We recently took this truck to Gatlinburg, Tennessee and it was me (the big man), my 10 year old daughter and my wife. The trip in this truck was made with very minor inconvenience and was averaging 372 miles to fourteen gallons of gas. We rode through the smokies, Cherokee and cades cove. We saw people looking at this cute little truck. 

If you want to be a pickup man, and want something dependable and easy on gas and maintainance; then let me promise you, this is your truck! Take one out for a test drive, I'm sure you will love it from then on! Thanks and have a great day!<br><br>
