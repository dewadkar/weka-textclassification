            I bought this vehicle thinking i could take it on long trips, access remote vacationing areas, and hauling my boat.  What I got was a gas guzzling snail.  The Ford Explorer provides absolutely no power and is capable of nothing.  While unsafe for street driving, it lacks the ground clearance for off road use.  i bet i could find a Ferrari with more ground clearance than that of the Ford Explorer.  I bought this car fully loaded.  It had the works and let me tell you about these &quot;works&quot;.  The leather is of lowest quality.  It comes with air holes poked all over the seat which look very cheap.  This rig is about as nimble as a 747.  Watch out for the roll factor when cornering at what you think is a reasonable speed.  The Explorer has an extremely high center of gravity which makes it one of the most flipped automobiles on the road today.  dispite the minimal ground clearance, Ford has found a way to still make the Explorer unsafe.  The constipated roar that lurkes beneath the hood is nothing but empty power.  There were VERY few things that satisfied me about this truck.  <br><br>
