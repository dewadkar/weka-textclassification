            I recently bought the 2001 Ford Escape because my family needed the extra room (my son is going away to college), and because they're the thing to get.  There is no more popular vehicle on the road. 

The handling of this vehicle is like that of a car, and the traction from the wheels is superb.  Gas mileage is pretty good compared to other SUV's.  I get around 23 city, 26 highway.  Pickup is there when you need it.

Luxury is not this vehicle's main concern, but it definitely has extras that are useful.  The interior is comfortable, and it is fairly spacious.  I am six feet tall, and whether driving the car, or sitting in the back seat, I feel comfortable.  

The CD player is well made, and the speakers pack a punch.  The dash console looks great, and it always looks clean.

The outside looks sharp wth its curves and great aerodynamics.
