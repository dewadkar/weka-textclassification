            Actually we don't own one Ford Taurus, we own two. We first bought one last year for my daughter who turned 16 and needed a car to take her from school and back, not to mention the many activities she was involved in after school.

 The price was reasonable and the idea of having to spend very little for gas money sold us on the Ford Taurus.  It's a 1992 Ford Taurus GL and was in excellent condition. The one thing that we found bad about the Ford Taurus is that transmissions go out on them fairly regularly and they are expensive to replace. The great unexpected news is how well they hold up in an actual car accident.

This car survived a three car accident that could have killed our daughter if she had been in a less solidly built car. Now you can guess why we have two. We bought another one for the family after seeing how well they handle and how safe they are on the road. It doesn't hurt that our gasoline expenses were cut in half either. They are reasonably priced with plenty of room for a family of four. Great car for students and small family's <br><br>
