            The F350 fits all of our needs perfectly.  It is a great truck compared to its competition.  My family has horses and originally bought this truck to pull horse trailers on long road trips through various states.  The F350 did not falter once even when loaded with a full 6 horse trailer.  It is not only a very powerful truck, but from our experience thus far, it is a very reliable truck as well.  The only problem we've had with the truck was a minor problem with the air conditioning when we first received it.  There was simply something hooked up wrong and the problem was fixed in only a couple of hours.  We have come to like the dependability that we did not previously find in our Chevrolet 3500 series, but that is a different topic.  I would definitely recommend the F350 to anyone who needs a powerful truck and who would rely on it to perform in the clutch.<br><br>
