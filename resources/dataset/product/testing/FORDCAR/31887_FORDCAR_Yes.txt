            I travel about 50 miles round trip to work every day.  It was costing me about $30.00 a week in gas to travel to work in the car I had at the time.  It was a mid-size car (a 1990 Taurus) and it didn't get very good gas mileage.  It was a nice car, but I needed something economical for the mileage I was having to drive daily.  

I looked around at different car lots for about 3 weeks and finally found a 1997 white Ford Escort.  I feel in love with it the minute I saw it.  It came with air conditioner, AM/FM casette radio, and front bucket seats.  It was just what I was looking for.  

It is now Feb. 2000 and I still have my little Escort.  It has been a great little car.  I plan on keeping it until I get it paid off.  It is great on gas, even in the city.  I have put about 72,000 miles on it, but it hasn't failed me yet.

If you are looking for an economical car, I would recommend the Ford Escort.  You'll love it like I do.
