            This may not be the best review you will read, but it is from the perseption of somone who experienced this car. My boyfriend pulled into my drivway with a big grin on his face the day he got his ZX2. It was green, and had a sun roof, and a C.D. player. He took me for a ride in it the day he got it, and I immediately liked it. it rode smooth, and was quick, and so quiet. It was about a month or so before he finally let me drive it. I noticed right away how fast it picked up speed... it did not waste anytime responding to the pedal. This car has a sleek, cute look. Great job, Ford, for making a car that is well worth it's price. <br><br>
