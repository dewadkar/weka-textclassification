            I first bought this car for value, i got a really good price including a rebate. To be a compact car it was pretty roomy. Now I am absolutely in love with what I call my little scorty. It is room enough for a car seat and two children in the back seat. The passenger side is also roomy. I have a manual shift which is very easy to maneuver. I have NEVER had any major problems with my car. (knock on wood)It handles very well. The mileage is great. The air conditioner in car blows like Antartica. Its great. My husband likes to drive my car because it is much more economical than the huge manly car he drives. Although I do plan on buying a newer car in the near future I do plan to pass this well built AMERICAN car onto my daughter. Which by the way is an excellent car for teenagers, or a first time car buyer.<br><br>
