            My tiny ranger and I have done everything together.  Of all the objects I can review, this is the one I know best.  I do not normally have sentimental feelings for materialistic things, but this little truck has shown me how to respect a machine.

I bought the truck used in 1995 with 21,000 miles on it.  It has a manual transmission, 2wd, standard cab, short bed and 4 cylinders.  This thing screams wimpy as I drive down the road, but I can honestly say I have put it to the test.  I have piled hay bales in the bed twice as high as the truck and have driven through rugged farms.  I have driven across the country. Moved three times with furniture hanging over the sides...all without a peep from that truck.  Currently, I have 106,000 miles on it and I have only had to replace the tires.

The truck has very little acceleration, which is why I recommend a manual transmission to get the umph when you need it.  The truck is low to the ground and gets stuck in the snow and mud easily.  The transmission seems to be unbreakable, but I noticed another review on epinions stating the exact opposite.  The truck does well for maneuvering and gets great gas mileage.  I am still getting about 25 miles to the gallon.

Now I am building a family and the truck seems a little small.  I no longer work on the farm and a truck isn't as important.  I will eventually sell it, but that will be a hard day.  Maybe I can park it in the backyard, pour concrete over it and build a shrine to that Ranger.<br><br>
