            A few years ago we needed a new car. I researched on the internet for days and finally ended up buying a new 1997 Ford Escort Wagon LX 5 speed online. Not only did I get a great price with exactly what I wanted but this car has never given us a problem, not once. I chose the five speed rather than the automatic because its much faster. The automatic lagged considerably. I loved the price, its great car for the money. Its not too old lady looking. The interior has help up WONDERFULLY, we do have three boys who can do some serious damage with a happy meal. The back seats fold down and give you plenty of cargo space for large items. A stroller fits great in the back trunk area. Currently we fit two car seats and a five year old in the back seat with no problems. I think the best part about the Ford Escort Wagon is that in a few years when its paid off, it will still be in great shape and make a nice second car for years to come. Unlike my mothers Range Rover that shes had for a year now and its in the shop every other week.<br><br>
