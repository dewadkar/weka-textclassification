            We were looking for a mini-van when we saw the Ford Taurus.  We took the car for a drive and fell in love with it immediately.  This car has been so dependable, we gave our 2nd car to our daughter.  The comfort of this car made long trips seem like trips to the grocery store and back.  I recommend this car to anyone with a family, there is plenty of room in the back for the children.  The truck opens to wide space for baggage and other vacation items.  We have 65,000 miles on our Taurus and it has never been in the shop for repairs.  Comfort, dependable, beauty and spacious is wrapped up in one word and that is Taurus.  Everyone should drive a Taurus.<br><br>
