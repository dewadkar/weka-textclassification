            This was my first car... It's gorgeously Silver!  (hence my naming her QuickSylva) I love it!  I've driven close to 145,000 miles on QuickSylva and I have enjoyed each one.  I will have had her for 6 years this April and never a problem.  :D  It's dependable and looks great!  
Most of my miles on this car have been highway miles but it definitely gets me where I want to go.  I get great gas mileage (which is especially important now with the rising gas prices) and the upkeep is not expensive.  I have had no major dealership repairs.  Shortly after I got the car, the cassette deck began to act crazy, but it was still under warranty, so no problem... They replaced it with anther one and it works fine.  
The only other problem I ran into was the fact that the cigarette lighter kept shorting out whenever the lighter was used.  But since I don't smoke, that was no biggie either.  It too, was repaired under warranty.  I just use the cigarette lighter for the CD player.  I wish my car had come equipped with a CD player, but with all the other great features, that was a small issue.  The sound in the car is fabulous.  I expected to have to purchase upgraded speakers but the factory ones are wonderful!  
One thing I really love about this car is the SPACE!!!  I don't think I've been in another compact car that has such great room in the front!  There is lots of hip room, leg room and head room.  You don't feel that you're crammed and jammed, unless you're in the back.  I have a tall brother and he says that the back seat space is limited, but hey... I'm the driver!  :D  The cup holders are cool for short cups, but don't attempt tall or wide cups.  They won't make it around the curve without painting pretty colors on your carpet.  
The trunk space is AMAZING!!!  Unbelievable!!!  I moved this summer and I was able to pack soooooo much stuff into QuickSylva!  I was surprised as to how much I was able to get in there.  And the fact that the back seats fold down is incredible!  This is a GREAT BUY!
