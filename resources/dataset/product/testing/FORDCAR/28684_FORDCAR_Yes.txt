            I added this van to my Love It list because compared to the other vans on the market it is far superior.  The construction of the van is designed with durability in mind.  As with other Ford vehicles, there is a high degree of emphasis placed on fit and finish.  Many components are bolted on rather than welded.  Over time the welds on other vans may start to weaken and that is where annoying squeaks and rattles come from.

All Ford vans use a double side wall construction whereas other vans use a single sidewall.  This means that if your piece of equipment puts a dent into the wall on the inside, it will not affect the outside appearance.  A Chevrolet, on the other hand, is a single sidewall construction.  This leads to more road noise and a less solid feel overall.

Ford uses the Triton family of engines in the Econoline series.  The 4.2L V6 is 215HP, which is more than the old Ford 302 V8.  The 4.6L V8 is the same engine Ford uses in the Mustang GT, F150 Pickup, Expedition, Lincoln Towncar, Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis, and the soon to be released 2002 Explorer.  It is 230HP, approximately the same as the 351 V8 Ford used to use in their vehicles.  The big V8 is the 5.4L, which produces 260HP and 360 ft lb torque.  This enables the Econoline van to pull 6900lbs in E150, and more than that in E250 and E350.  The Triton engines feature Fail-Safe Cooling which allows a driver to go up to 20 miles at 55mph on an overheated engine.  It alternates combustion in the cylinders and cools the engine by forcing air through the cylinders not firing.  The engine will shut down before permanent damage occurs.

Currently, Ford is outselling GM by about 15-20% and Dodge by a 10:1 ratio.  This is due to a classic style and overall durability that Ford customers have come to expect; they are not disappointed.<br><br>
