            It was love at first sight when I purchased my 1997 Ford Explorer Sport.
With a moon roof, Side Bars and a Tow package I was the envy of my neighbors and friends. I love the sporty look and the power you have on snowy days. The all wheel drive will get you out of any snowy situation. I love cruising down the highway at night, with the moon roof open, allowing the stars to gaze down at you. What a great feeling. I am tall (about 5 ft 10 inches) and I seem to have adequate room on the drivers side. However, someone over 6ft tall may be uncomfortable on both the drives side, and especially on the passengers side, which seems less roomy. I discovered this when a very tall (and big) friend of my rode on the passengers side of my Explorer and whom I also allowed to drive one day. 

There is a radio in the back, which children have full access too. I haven't figured out a way to child proof that back radio yet.  I haven't had any mechanical problems with my Explorer Sport as of yet. Although it is starting to get a little noise under the hood, which a Ford mechanic told me was completely common. Also, I'm starting to hear a little air in the back. 

The most disappointing thing that I've had to face is the appearance of rust on my side bars which was purchased with the Explorer and is a product of Ford. Ford dealerships within my area have told me that it is not covered under warranty because it is an attachment and not considered part of the car (not to mention I am just over the 36,000 mile warranty). Please note that there is a 5 year unlimited mile warranty for any other rust that may appear on any other part of the Explorer. I am under the impression that this is happening quite frequently, as the dealerships within my area have told me that they have seen quite a few of these &quot;rusty&quot; side bars come through. So beware when purchasing side bars with your Ford Explorer. <br><br>
