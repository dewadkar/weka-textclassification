            My wife's former car was an Infiniti Q45, luxurious but quite expensive to maintain.  After the $2,000 Anti-Lock Brake system failed, we decided it was time to try something different.  We were less worried about luxury this time around, and more interested in low maintenance and reliability.  Comfort would be nice, too, even if we were no longer in the market for Taj Mahal-caliber.

My first thought was the Taurus.  I've driven them frequently as rental cars, and I've always been impressed with their ride and value.  They're not performance cars, and they won't get you noticed on the road, but they're roomy, comfortable, and have a six-cylinder engine that's certainly adequate for most daily drives.

Well, we went shopping and drove a 2000 Taurus, and I came away unimpressed by the styling.  On the passenger side, the dash is enormous and bulky, and the car just didn't have the same 'feel' that my rental cars had offered.  I wasn't sure why, but something wasn't right.  We abandoned the Taurus concept.

A little more shopping, and we were convinced that we liked the Oldsmobile Intrigue.  It was nice, classy, and drove well.  So we let our fingers do the walking, and found the best selection of Intrigues at an Oldsmobile dealership a few miles away.  We showed up on the lot, and pondered a few Intrigues priced in the $13,000 range.  (These were one- or two-year-old models, in keeping with my philosophy of never paying for the first-year depreciation of a new car.)

But as fate would have it, the Oldsmobile dealership happened to have a 1998 Taurus on the lot that had been traded in.  We sat in it, and I quickly realized that the styling of the '98 model was what I remembered from my rental car days.  This model differs strongly from the 2000 model, and while it's purely a matter of taste, I greatly prefer the '98's design.  Markedly oval, with easy-to-use instrumentation and a truly innovative center-seat console, the car offered good headroom, comfortable (if relatively simple) seats, and quite ample leg and shoulder room.  My wife and I immediately noticed that the Taurus felt much roomier than the Intrigue, particularly in the shoulder area.  (We're both relatively tall, so this is important.)  

We drove the car, and it was obvious to both of us that it offered enough of everything:  enough power, enough room, and enough handling.  There was nothing about the car that we felt was a concession or a drawback to be overlooked.  And the best news?  We were able to buy the car for only about $10,000, which was much less costly than any of the other options that we'd considered.  Admittedly, it's sparse on options - no power seats, no power locks, and no CD player, and the speakers are not top-quality - but hey, it's a $10,000 car.

The bottom line?  It's not fancy, but it's classy in an understated sort of way, and it gets the job done splendidly, whether you're puttering about town or hitting the highway.  There are more luxurious cars out there, and there are faster cars out there, but I'll gladly take my Taurus and avoid the extra $20,000 in payments that "more luxurious" and "faster" would have cost me.
