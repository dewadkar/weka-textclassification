            I have written previously about the Ford Bronco (1995 XLT) I own.  This was more a matter of addressing an epinion I wished to agree with.  This time, I would like to further expound on the Bronco's abilities and drawbacks.  I will do this quickly and concisely using a bullet format.

*What do you want out of your 4x4?
*Will you carry a bunch of kids to soccer practice in Arizona?
*Will you be going up to the mountain cabin in Colorado?
*Will you be towing a small trailer, or some huge boat?
*Will you be four wheeling in your 4x4 vehicle?
If these questions sound like you, then maybe you are a fit to the fullsize Bronco.  If you just tow, or maybe just carry kids around, then maybe a minivan or suburban is right for you.

The Newer Ford Bronco is a capable 4x4 vehicle.  These days, it is equipped with a 5.0 or 5.8 litre V8, manual or auto, and as much or little comfort as you desire.  Unfortunately, it is a discontinued item as of 1996.  Do not despair, however, the Bronco name has gone on for quite some time and I still believe it will be &quot;ressurected&quot;.  Hopefully in a form that we, the consumers, wish.  

The automatic is an E4OD and is used in all Ford Fullsize Trucks as is the Borg Warner 1356 Part time transfer case.  My Specs show that these are the components used in 3/4 and 1 ton Ford trucks as well.  The driveshafts and axles are usually stronger on the heavier configurations.  Running stock on a Bronco consists of Dana 44IFS(TTB) Front and Ford 8.8 Rear.  Again, let me say this is newer broncos.  The nice thing is that these are pretty fair components for a stock vehicle.  That is why people like me covet this type of vehicle, if you are looking  to really make it a good, all-around 4x4.  One bit for the gearheads:

* Axleshafts: 44 1.31, 8.8, 1.31
* Spline Count: 44 30, 8.8 31
Yes there are lots of aftermarket upgrades for these axles as well!
 So you have a very solid drivetrain and engine, especially when considering that although a Bronco may weigh more than a Jeep well-equipped, it certainly weighs less than the likes of a Sub, Tahoe, Expedition, etc. 

Turning radius, I kid you not, (since I have owned a YJ Jeep and a Bronco), is remarkable in a Bronco.  It has a 104.7 Inch Wheelbase. I believe it is within a foot or two of the jeep.  Yes, &quot;a foot or two&quot; is vague, but a jeep's turning radius is as low as it gets, so a fullsize doing something similar is impressive.  Remember, the Bronco has 101cuft. interior measured space, while a Jeep xj or yj  or tj might have 75 tops.  The latter have more like 50.

The Bronco is extremely capable off-road, from the factory.
*It is not the best vehicle for people-carrying.  Back seat Access.
*It can tow very heavy loads (7000 lbs.)
*It has very comfortable seats up front.
*It is an ideal &quot;hunters Rig&quot;
*It is very reliable, if maintained properly.
*IT IS A TRUCK IN DISGUISE.  It is heavily built(does not break down), while still maintaining a comfortable, smooth ride at highway speeds.

I know this may have gotten a bit technical for some, but Those considering a Bronco purchase for specific uses should find this epinion helpful for what kind of vehicle they are after.
