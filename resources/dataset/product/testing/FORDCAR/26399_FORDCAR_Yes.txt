            I had never really considered myself to be a Minivan type person.When we had our daughter, I really wanted a safe vehicle.I wanted a car I could get her in and out of easily.

We went car shopping not knowing we would actually buy a Minivan.I always thought they would be too hard to drive because they are bigger than your average car.I also thought I would never be able to get that big of a car in a parking place.

I have always heard great things about a windstar. So, when we saw it we decided to test drive.I absolutely loved it.It drove just like a car, I couldn't believe I could actually get it into a parking place.

We decided that the windstar was the best vehicle for us.We purchased a used 1996 windstar.Our Windstar has all the standard features as well as the optional 3.8 liter motor(which I highly recommend),anti-lock brakes,and factory tinted windows.

The only thing I wish my van had was the 4 doors.We are expecting another baby in July and that would definitely come in handy.We are seriously thinking of purchasing a new van so we can have the 4 doors.We have been so happy with our windstar that we plan to purchase a new one in the coming year.<br><br>
