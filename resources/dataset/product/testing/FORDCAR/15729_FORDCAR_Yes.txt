            Earlier, I had owned a great car but then my kids came along so I decided I needed a minivan. My husband and I first bought the box-style Dodge Caravan. We despised it within a month of owning it. It was very "cheap" and did not have enough power for me with its 4 cylinder engine. Within a year, the Caravan was sold and we were looking for a new minivan. Then I saw the all new Ford Windstar. It had a very sleek design compared to all the other "box-style" minivans like my Caravan. Plus it had a powerful 3.8L 6 cylinder engine. I never thought that I would like a minivan for a car, but I love my Windstar more than any car that I've had. It has everything including an unbelievable AC/heating system, great stereo system, comfort, roominess, and most important, it's extremely reliable. I've only had one problem with it that turned out to be my fault because I wore down the brakes. Also, when the Windstar was released in 1995, it was named "The Safest Minivan" which was another reason we purchased it.
