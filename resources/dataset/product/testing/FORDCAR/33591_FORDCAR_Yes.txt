            The Ford Mustang Cobra is, in my epinion, the leader of the Mustang family.  The Saleen, some would say, is supposed to lead the pack, but since Saleen is not made by Ford, it cannot lead.  

In 1999, the Cobra's new body style came and disappointed this driver.  I actually hate the new style, but many of my friends like it.  The new style gives a &quot;spaceship&quot; like appearance.  The new style looks very cartoony or possibly from a video game.  Anotherwards, not very conventional.  

However, the 1995-1998 Mustang Cobras are my favorite.  The 1995 style came with a 302 Cubic Inch Engine, 5.0 liters, producing approximately 305 horsepower.  This car was a monster and contested Chevrolet's Camaro Z-28, which I like better anyhow.  The 1996-1998 Cobras came with a 302 Cubic Inch Engine, 4.6 liters, and produced almost the exact same amount of power.  All of these Cobras looked very sleek and stylish.  The mandatory 3 inch exhaust really set them apart.  

The interior of all Mustangs is attractive, but not luxurious in my epinion.  The optional leather and performance package make the Cobra more comfortable than not.  I recommend getting a manual shift in the Cobra because it really makes the car and offers better response. (Aside from the fact that it's easier to spin the tires)

The Price of the Cobra is what attracts me to it:  A 1996 Cobra can be purchased for about 15,000 dollars in the year 2000 right now!  (assuming the car is mint, and a base model)  Check www.edmunds.com for more info.

I will always be a Cobra fan, but a true Chevrolet enthusiast.<br><br>
