            In 1991, I became the owner of a 1991 Ford Festiva L.  It had a 5-speed transmission, an AM/FM Cassette radio and a rear window defroster, and that's it.  I suffered in the summer from the lack of an air conditioner, one option that I should have given more consideration to.  I loved to drive the 5-speed because of the car's light weight the engine was very responsive.

It was a very smooth riding car and because of the 5 speed the engine noise on the highway was very tolerable.  The brakes were more than adequate even with three passengers.  I grew to love the little car because of it's reliability and the low cost of maintenance.  I felt so confident in my Festiva that I drove it from Detroit to San Diego and back in November 1993 through the mountains of Colorado and the Deserts of Nevada.  I also encountered a snow and ice storm in Nebraska on the way back, still, I made it in record time.

My biggest knock against the car is the lack of interior space for hauling things (i.e. my 3 year olds electric car.  I had to tie it to the roof).  I say that if that is what you need a car for, the Festiva is the wrong car to buy.  If you need reliable, great gas mileage, low maintenance costs, solid all-around transportation, the Festiva is a great buy.  I foolishly got rid of it in 1995 because it was being neglected due to the fact that I had purchased a year earlier a new 1994 Pontiac Trans Am GT.  I bought a used 1991 Ford Festiva last December and I traveled 2 hours into Ohio to get it because everywhere I spotted one in the Detroit Metro area, by the time I would respond to it, the darned thing had been sold.  I have also spotted a used 1991 near my home for only $495 (a steal if it runs).

The one that I bought in December, I plan to put some money into it and not only bring it back to specs, but I plan to jazz it up a little bit if you know what I mean.  We have a Ford Windstar mini-van, so the Festiva's are mine.  In closing, depending upon what your needs in an automobile are, I think that you should confidently give consideration to buying a Festiva, and then ... let the good times roll!<br><br>
