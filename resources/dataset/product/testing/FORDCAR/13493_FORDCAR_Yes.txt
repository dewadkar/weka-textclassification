            I previously owned a 1998 Ford Windstar and was looking for something smaller yet capable of hauling cargo and a trailer. I also wanted 4-wheel drive with an automatic transmission since I drive sometimes 60 miles each way to work and back over back roads that often are not plowed.
  After test driving several makes and models, including Blazers, Cherokees, Explorer XLT (4 Door) and Ford Expediton, I tried the 2-door Explorer Sport. I fell in love with it in less than a minute out of the dealer's lot. It has power, handled better than the other SUV's I drove, had all the equipment I wanted, plus some and came at a great price. Granted, there is no mistaking this vehicle for a truck. It is definitely a truck, but its ride is not at all offensive. The vehicle I purchased has all the luxury equipment of my car including a 6 disk CD changer in the console. 
  In the five months I have owned this truck, I made 4 non-stop round trips of 780 miles each way. I never got &quot;saddle sore&quot;, nor had any hesitation about driving at speeds well in excess of the posted 65 mph limit. After the recall fix for the cruise control, the cruise control easily and very smoothly maintained the speed I selected, no matter the speed. The only thing about this vehicle to date that I expected more from was the fuel mileage. I average 18 - 19 mpg at highway speeds and about 16 - 17 in town. I was hoping for better from the V-6. 
  To date, I have had nothing but praise for this vehicle. Its one of the best looking SUV's on the market, the truck has been absolutely rattle free, even in the current frigid temperatures, the sound system is awesome, the leather seats very comfortable and supportive for me and the engine starts without hesitation. 
  If you're a single person or a couple, this is a wonderful SUV. There's room for all your stuff, especially with the rear seats folded down, its shorter in length that the 4-door SUV's for easy maneuvering, and its a kick to drive!  I highly recommend this vehicle. <br><br>
