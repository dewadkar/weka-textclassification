            I test drove a 2000 Mustang for fun and it wasn't much fun.  I couldn't find the seat adjustor.  The car made me feel about 5 feet tall.  (I am 5'8).  It also felt like it was as long a football field.  I really can't tell you how it drove on the highway. I was so unimpressed by this car my test drive only lasted about 10 minutes.  From what I could tell was that in town driving was nice, but like I said I felt the car was too big.

I test drove a convertble.  That was ice, very nice.  The radio in this car is fanstic.  The sales lady even told me to get one of my own CDs with alot of base and crank the radio just to see how great it really was.  Boy oh boy can that thing thump (for being factory).  The leather seats were also a nice touch but I did feel like I was going to slide across the car if I took a corner too sharpe.  But that is something that you would get used to over time and as the leather gets worn wouldn't be to bad.

All in all this is a fun car to test drive for fun but I would not own it.  And not only becuase it is a Ford but for all the above reasons.<br><br>
