            Yes we did buy this car knowing that it had 23,000 miles on it from being used as a Hertz rental car, and considering that fact it has held up very well.  

Appearance:
What I like best about the Taurus is the exterior styling.  Looking at the car from the side gives the impression of a seamless flowing line.  It may be a bit outrageous but it looks great with the 5-spoke alloy wheels and Willow Green paint.  Some people don't like the new look, but I'm tired of all sedans looking like they come out of a cookie press.  This is a car that dares to be different and does so elegantly.

Performance:
The standard 3.0 liter Vulcan V-6 engine is no hot rod, and the jerky shifts that the automatic transmission makes doesn't make the engine's job any easier.  However, the engine is adequate and provides enough response for most all situations.  Handling in the Taurus is above average for a large car.  The steering is very responsive, and the suspension does a good job of keeping the car pinned down.  The ride should be a little better though.  The suspension is supple but some larger bumps tend to upset it, and makes a lot of noise going over the rough stuff.  The brakes should be great they are four wheel disc with ABS, but under repeated hard breaking the steering wheel and brake pedal vibrate.

Interior:
The interior is very nicely finished and the dash has a good quality look and feel to it.  I especially like the integrated pod in the center of the dash where stereo and climate controls are located.  The controls are easy to reach and have a quality feel to them.  The front seats are well shaped, and the back seat is high, roomy, and comfortable.  Road, wind, and engine noise are never intrusive.  The trunk is very large, but shallow.  The cruise control works well and de-activates with the slightest touch of the brake pedal.  

Reliability:
Mechanical reliability has been great.  The Vulcan 3.0 liter V-6 has been around for a long time and has proven itself reliable.  There was a problem with a back window that refused to go down, a driver and rear door lock that refused to unlock by the power locks, and one recall for the engine temperature gauge.  However, other than that the car is reliable and made a great replacement for the 1988 Ford Taurus we had owned before.
