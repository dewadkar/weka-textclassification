            When I first saw the new Ford <b>Focus</b>, the first thing that came to my mind was, &quot;wow, that is a really nice <b>Jetta&quot;.</b> Honestly, I couldn't believe how much this looked the Volkswagon's best selling car. Upon a closer look, I found the <b>Focus</b> to be a car that can hold its own, but still has a few problems.

The Ford <b>Focus</b> was first introduced to the public with the 2000 model, and recently won the 2000 North American Car of the Year. Designed to be a sporty car, yet good on fuel and still basically an economy car, the <b>Focus</b> is definitely a head turner. The body style is sleek and stylish and really does look good. This is not your daddy's Ford anymore.

<b>Models</b> - The Ford <b>Focus</b> comes in several different models: ZX3, LX, SE, ZTS, and the Wagon SE. Body styles range from two door, to sedan, to wagons. There are also the more &quot;sportier&quot; models within the series (ZX3, SE) . The LX is the model that I have been driving and is considered the base model of the <b>Focus</b> line and this also appears to be the most popular model of the <b>Focus.</b>

<b>Price</b> - As the models vary, so does the price. The base price for the <b>Focus</b> is LX sedan is $12,780.00. Of course, this will get you the bottom of barrel car, no AC, no automatic transmission. A well equipped <b>Focus</b> (AC, auto, ABS, etc) will run you around $17,000.00. While this seems a bit steep for a compact car, I suggest you get used to the sticker shock, as cars are all pretty pricey these days (I know it took me a while to accept that fact).

<b>Interior</b> - The Ford <b>Focus</b> is a pretty roomy vehicle and seats five people comfortably. It also features a very large trunk space that can easily fit several suitcases. The back seat are the 40/60 fold down type, which allow you to carry longer items in the trunk. The interior is really sleek and does look very, well, futuristic. 

<b>Handling</b> - The <b>Focus</b> handles pretty well and actually feels like you are drive a much sportier car than a compact sedan. However, I do have a few complaints. The interior is <b>very</b> noisy. This really took me by surprise as I expected a smooth, quiet ride. Wrong. My suggestion is if you get a <b>Focus</b>, you better get a good stereo, because you will hear a good amount of road noise, even on a smooth surface. Another complaint I have is that the engine (a standard four cylinder, 2.0 liter model), is one of the most gutless that I have ever driven. I hate to admit it, but I was passed going up a hill by a 70ish VW bus. Now that was embarrassing. 

Overall, the Ford <b>Focus</b> is a pretty nice car that does drive reasonably well (if you can get over the fact that it has no power). If you are looking for a car that is sporty, but still easy to afford, you may want to take a look at the <b>Focus</b>. While not as nice as the Jetta, it is still a decent car for the price, just make sure you have a good stereo to drown out the road noise. <br><br>
