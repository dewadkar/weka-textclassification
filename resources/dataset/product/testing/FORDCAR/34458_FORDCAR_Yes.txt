            This is a perfect work truck.  The first thing that comes to mind when someone ask's me about this truck is the torque, and horsepower, with the manual transmission you can tow just about anything, ATV's, Campers, fifth wheel trailers, all kinds of loads.  As far as the cab goes it's very roomy for anyone unless your eight feet tall.  One thing that isn't so great about this truck is when they break down they break down good it's usually an expensive trip to the shop.  If it's gas mileage your lookin for this isn't the Truck for you because the power comes at a price because even on the highway the gas needle falls pretty fast.  all in all though if your lookin for a good powerful work truck I highly recommend this.<br><br>
