<b>The Top Line</b>

I&#146ve been driving a 2001 Escape for the last couple of years &#150 and I love it. Of course, there are a few things about the vehicle that can drive you crazy &#150 more later. Recently I was on a business trip and had an opportunity to rent a 2003 Escape for a week. <i>&#148I wonder what changes they&#146ve made?&#148 </i> thought I , <i>&#147perhaps they took note of my consumer response surveys and fixed something&#148.</i> And perhaps not .. so read on.

<b>The Market</b> 

Originally targeted at the low-end market ($18-25k) the Escape, and its competitors are digging into the low-end of regular SUV sales (Explorer) as well as replacing the family sedan and station wagon. This section of the market is growing rapidly and is putting a smile on your local Ford dealers face. The mini-SUVs, as they are now called, are bringing this kind of vehicle into new territory. When Ford initially launched the Escape several years ago they estimated that 44% of buyers are women, and nearly 2/3rds are new Ford customers.

<b>The Engine</b>

I drove a 2003 Ford Escape XLT 4 by 4 with a three-litre engine and four-speed automatic transmission. Pay attention to the size of the engine &#150 bigger is better. The 3.0L 24 valve Duratec V6 makes for a zippy ride, serving up 201 horses and 196 pound-feet of torque. Certainly enough to rack up a respectable 8.8 seconds for 0-60mph. Pullaway from lights is more than respectable and I had no problems merging onto high-speed interstates or overtaking slower-moving cars when needed. The engine does get a bit noisy at around 80-85mph, but that probably has much to do with the body construction as the mechanics of the engine itself.  The Escape can tow up to 3500 pounds, although I have no direct experience of towing anything with either my 2001 model or this 2003.

You do have the option for the lower-price models of getting a 2.0L manual engine. This magnificent animal offers 127 horsepower and is woefully underpowered for the vehicle. Can you say &#145acceleration of a dead sheep&#148 ?

Fuel economy is average at best. I experienced 15-16mpg driving around the city, and about 21mpg on the highway. Which brings me to one of the largest drawbacks of the Ford Escape - <i>THE GAS TANK IS TOO SMALL</i>. Fitting 13 gallons on a good day, you get an effective range of just under 200 to 250 miles. Our local gas station attendant knows me by name.

<b>The Interior</b>

Wow. The interior has changed. The controls are all in the same place, although it&#146s nice to see that all the rocker switches for power-windows and locking are now illuminated instead of just the single switch for the drivers door. A pet peeve fixed !!  However, the gearshift level on the steering column still tends to obscure the radio controls and the ignition is still tough to find in the dark.

The Escape is really the Mazda Tribute in disguise, which accounts for the better than average cheap-Ford care styling inside. As opposed to the 2001 which has cheap plastic everywhere, the interior plastic and panels have been upgraded, and my rental proffered a pleasant two-tone cabin color scheme.
Despite all these minor annoyances, when it comes right down to it, there is a lot of room in these Escapes. The rear seat can be folded down in a 40/60 split (and remember to remove the headrests and tuck them under the front seats <b>before</b> you start) yielding 65 cuft3 of space. The rear seat is also roomy, I managed to fit three six-footers in the back without anyone&#146s knees getting damaged.

<b>Safety</b> 

Dual front air bags are standard on all models. The XLS comes with optional four-wheel antilock brakes. The XLT and Limited styles have ABS as standard. Side airbags are optional on the XLS and XLT, and standard on the Limited, which also has a reverse sensing system &#150 very useful for parallel parking and making sure you don&#146t run over your boss who is senselessly standing behind the vehicle.

<b>Competition</b>

If you are looking at this car, check out the Honda CRV, Hyundai Santa Fe, Toyota RAV4 and Saturn Vue. You should also look at the Nissan Xterra and Jeep Liberty if you want something a little rougher and more rugged..

<b>The Bottom Line</b>

Aside from a pea-sized gas tank and a little more road noise than you&#146d expect I can&#146t find a reason not to recommend this mini-SUV if you&#146re in the market. The 2003 model sports several improvements over the 2001 version, mainly cosmetic, and offers you a sporty, zippy ride. Its not the SUV to buy if you will be spending a lot of time off-road as the 4WD is more for show than necessity, but you can comfortably fit 5 in the vehicle, feel safe driving around town and the highway and know that it is reliable enough to get you there.
