             I bought a new ford ranger standard cab, 2 1/2 years ago. I have taken a few long trips in this vehicle and have found for long trips it is a little uncomfortable. as far as dependability it has been a very dependable truck, I have not had any major problems with this truck other than just one small irritating  problem, my inside light does not turn off after the door is shut. It gets very good gas mileage and rides well.
