            We purchased a 1999 Taurus from Oakley-Keesee Ford in April 1999. We bought the Taurus mainly because we wanted a reliable, affordable family car. We were replacing a 1990 Mitsubishi Galant with 140,000+ miles, which never had been reliable, even when new. My experience and reading had convinced me that Ford is ahead of other U.S. car makers in quality. The Taurus also has a long track record of success and popularity, and was very attractively priced compared to similar and smaller(!) Japanese sedans. 

We bought the entry-level Taurus with a 3.0L V-6 and minimal extras. Air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, air bags, and cruise control were included. We paid Ford an extra $300 to get a cassette player console installed. The Taurus radio comes integrated in a circular console containing numerous other vehicle controls. This conveniently (for Ford) renders it almost impossible to install third-party stereo equipment. Incidentally, the Ford cassette stereo system sounds very nice.

The Taurus is a definite step up in reliability and comfort. The ride is smooth and quiet. This is our first car that is not either a compact or sub-compact, so it feels huge to us. It is also our first car with automatic transmission. Sometimes I miss having control over the gears, but automatic does provide a much less &quot;busy&quot; ride. Acceleration is adequate for typical driving. Get the 3.8L V-6 for really quick acceleration. 

Price was a dominant concern in our purchase. The Taurus was &quot;on sale&quot; with a $500 rebate and 0.9% financing for three years. As I calculate it, we &quot;paid&quot; about $15,800 for the car, excluding taxes, service warranties, and other add-on fees. Paid is in quotes because we purchased the car with no cash down payment - only the rebate and a $1200 trade-in on the (barely running) Galant.

We had to take the car back to the dealer the week it was purchased due to an oil filter problem. Since then we have put 14,000 miles on the car and have had no real problems.

I recommend the Taurus, but research whatever you buy and make sure that you don't get &quot;taken&quot; by the dealer. The car we purchased for less than $16,000 had a sticker price of $18,300 on the window.<br><br>
