            I bought my 1998 Ford Escort SE in January of 1998. I made the decision rather quickly, but have been very happy over all since my purchase. I did some research on the net and then canvassed dealers all around Pittsburgh on a snowy Sunday, knowing that I'd make my purchase at a dealership in Morgantown. I had narrowed my choices to Chevy Cavalier, Toyota Corolla, and the Ford Escort.

The dealer in Morgantown had only two Pacific Green Escorts. One was a strippo LX and the other was a loaded SE. I had driven Escorts back in the 80's and always considered them a car to drive until you could afford something bigger and better. After the redesign in 1996-1997, the Escort is a much different car. I test drove the SE and was surprised by all its features--power everything including windows, door locks, mirrors, trunk release, remote control key fob to lock and unlock doors, open the trunk, or sound a &quot;panic alarm.&quot; My SE also has stereo/cassette, second generation dual airbags, cruise control, tilt steering and of all things an anti-theft system. On an Escort?! 

All this for $14,700. It's easy and fun to drive. It's got a tight, smooth ride (all independent front and rear suspension) and it's been completely reliable in the nearly two years since I've owned it. All I've done is the regular oil changes about every 3000 miles.

What don't I like? The front seats have a short cushion and don't go back far enough for my long legs. The head rests could go up higher--they don't reach the top of my head. The engine could use a bit more punch. It's more than adequate, but even at 2.0 liters, it only whips out 110hp. Engine noise is also intrusive under hard acceleration.

This vehicle is best suited to young couples on a budget. The back seat can accomodate children and small adults comfortably, but I wouldn't want to be back there for any length of time.

Overall, I'd give this car an 8 out of a possible 10.
