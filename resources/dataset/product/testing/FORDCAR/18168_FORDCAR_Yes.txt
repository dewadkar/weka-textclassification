            My husband and I have owned a 1990 Ford Probe for 5 years and haven't had any serious problems with it.  So, when we were looking to get another used car, we both wanted another Probe.  In our search, I stumbled upon a loaded 1996 Probe GT that was listed on EBay.  The car was located at a dealer in Miami which is over 1000 miles away from our Connecticut home, but the price was worth it for the high end model.  We won the auction at a little under $6000 which was a lot cheaper than we would have paid locally.  The car was shipped to us about a week later.

First off, this is the most beautiful car that me and my husband have ever owned.  It is red with a tan leather interior.  The car is loaded with options such as power windows, power locks, cruise control, remote locks, CD audio with subwoofer, sunroof and chrome rims.  Also, the GT model comes with the 2.5L V6 engine which is much stronger than the standard 4 cylinder engine.  We constantly have people telling us what a nice car this is.  If they only knew the price we paid!

The car itself handles very well and feels brand new even though it is a five year old car.  The gears shift effortlessly and the acceleration is very quick.  There is also very little noise and the drive is smooth.  We haven't driven this car in the snow yet, but our 1990 Probe does well as long as the snow isn't deep.  We like the fact that the Probe is front wheel drive in case we get caught in an expected snow storm.

We have two small kids, age 4 and 5, and there is plenty of room for them in the back of the car.  The driver and passenger seats are also very comfortable for adults, but longer legged individuals will certainly cut into the back seat leg space.  The controls are well laid out and our AM/FM CD stereo came with a subwoofer located in the trunk.  From what I can tell, this is a factory stereo and the sound is very good.  We also have a power sunroof that slides up and back to let in sun and air.  It doesn't have the clear cover that some power sunroofs have to let in sun and not air.  The hatchback trunk is very roomy and the back seats fold down to accommodate longer objects.

The Probe was discontinued by Ford in 1997, but there are a lot of used ones on the market.  If you are looking for a sporty car and don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a good automobile to check out.  Our 1990 Probe has been very reliable, but it is too early to tell how this 1996 GT model will be.  So far, we have had no trouble driving the car over the past two months since we purchased it.  My husband and I have been having a lot of fun driving this car and hope to get a lot of miles out of it.  We purchased the car with 73,000 miles and the car is still like new.
