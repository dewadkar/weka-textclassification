            That is right.  I recently purchased a 2001 ford explorer sport for my wife, and I must say that i was not expecting as much.  First let me start with the bad.  Since it is only a 2 door people must move the front seats to get in and out.  I expected this going in, the thing I didn't expect is that the seats do not adjust enough to easily move in and out.  the only other thing I had a problem with is that the interior is not that attractive.  I was expecting a few more gadgets.  I mean this is a 2001.
At least the good points outweigh the bad.  the first thing I noticed right away was the power.  I have a Toyota 4-runner with the same size engine, but it does not seem to be as powerful.  Once you get inside the seats are comfortable and roomy.  For a SUV in this class gas mileage is not a real terror either.  My wife really enjoys the puddle lamps located on the side mirrors.  This feature makes finding your keyhole easy.  Not to mention the security purposes this has.
Overall I would give it a 7 out of 10.  If you like Fords then this will be a good buy.  If you already have a grudge against Fords, this car will not bring you to the ford family.<br><br>
