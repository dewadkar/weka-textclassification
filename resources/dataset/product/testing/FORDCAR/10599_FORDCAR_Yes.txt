            I am one of the few lucky owners of a 2000 Trailhead Ranger.  When I was shopping for a new truck, I was looking for a 4x4, but was pretty sure I would not be able to afford one.  It was love at first sight when I saw my 2000 Trailhead Ranger.  It had the 4x4 looks that I love with I price that I could afford.  

My ranger has a 3.0 liter engine that gives me plenty of power.  I once had a Bronco II with a 2.6 liter engine, and whenever I drove up a hill on the highway, my speed would drop 10 to 20 mph.  With the 3.0, I can actually accelerate up hills without any difficulty.  While on the road I can enjoy good quality music on my cd player that comes standard in a Trailhead package.  Unfortunately, with the lifted body and 4x4 looks comes a slightly rougher ride.  But in my opinion, I would sacrifice a little comfort for the 4x4 look any day.  With a ground clearance of about 3 inches higher than the standard Ranger, it is easier to see the road and it makes it easier for other drivers to see me.  

I would recommend this truck for any body who is looking for a reliable truck.  It provides the power and performance needed for good, safe driving.  I'm 18 years old and I think that this truck definitely fits with a young and active person, because it does with me.  <br><br>
