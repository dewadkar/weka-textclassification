            The ford Taurus is a great car for young or old, i didn't want to by it by name , but when i sat in it and test drove it, it was quick for me to change my opinion. When i found out the facts about the Taurus i was pretty impressive. The safety on the car was excellent, a lot lower to insure than other cars, it drove real good and had lots of peep. There wasn't to much i didn't like about the car, it at more gas than my old four cylinder engine, but not much, and it sure out powered it. This is a great overall car with class, and is a car four just about anyone<br><br>
