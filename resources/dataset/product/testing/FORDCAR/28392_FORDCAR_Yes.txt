            I am very surprise at how good this car is.   I must preface this by saying that I have been more a fan of the foreign car makes than the American cars for many years.   It's hard to beat Honda and Toyota quality.   I currently own a Volvo V70 wagon as my other car.

I have the Taurus SE, 3.0 liter.   This car comes standard with most features buyers want:  Power windows, power door locks, remote entry, 16" alloy wheels, tilt, cruise, remote trunk release etc.   My only options are CD player, ABS brakes, and power seat.

Haveing recently owned a Toyota Camry which I loved and had NO unscheduled maintenance, I think I know a little about quality cars.   The Taurus has improved so much over the years, I think it deserves the "quality" badge as well.   Starting with the exterior, the paint is flawless, the doors and body panels fit perfectly, and the doors open and close solidly.   The interior is designed ergonomically with all the controls in the right places.   The stereo sounds very good for a factory job.   And I find the seats, with the lumbar control, very comfortable (I drive 50,000 miles a year).   
This car is quiet.   There is very little wind noise in the cockpit.   My Taurus has no rattles.  You barely hear the windshield wipers when they are running.   Passengers don't have to shout to be heard at highway speeds.

The 3.0 liter engine has plenty of power for passing and more than enough to give you speeding tickets on the highway.   I would prefer a little more power off the line and at lower speeds - different gearing might be the solution here, but I think most people won't notice this.   I personally would prefer the more powerful Duratec engine

The car rides nice and smooth and tames bumps and potholes very well.   I find the steering a little stiff and could be a bit quicker, but once again I don't think the average driver would find fault here

You can probably get a much better deal on the Taurus than 
on a Camry or Accord.   If you keep your cars very long you might come out ahead financialy with the higher resale value offerred by the Japanese cars.

For those of you convinced the Japanese cars are the way to go, I think you be surprised at how close Ford has come to almost matching them in quality.
