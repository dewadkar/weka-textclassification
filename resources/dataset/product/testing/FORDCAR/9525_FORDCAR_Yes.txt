            I am an owner of a 1995 Black hard top Mustang.  I bought this sports car new and still can honsetly say that this car is all that is suppose to be and more!  From it's sleek body look of a black cat to the plush interior comfort of a soft cashmere sweater.  Most people will grow tired of the same car by this time and I have to admit I still enjoy how it handles today and how the underbody and engine is still holding together very well.  It's performance is still outstanding.  Although, the model that I own is only a V6, it still has the pickup that is needed to 0 to 60 and it gets great mileage both in-town and highway.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone that is looking for a sports car that is affordable, very comfortable for two to travel, and won't kill you on insurance costs.  I have had no problems with anything going bad on it except the sensor gage for the fan.  I will warn any buyer of a mustang that they should remember to change the sensor about every 30,000 miles.  As we all know if the fan doesn't work, the car over heats and a head gasket or two could blow.  Hard lessoned learned on Insterstate I4 and a long way from home.  Honestly that is the only problem I have had with the car and never had to take it into the shop except for regular oil changes and/or transmission oil changes.<br><br>
