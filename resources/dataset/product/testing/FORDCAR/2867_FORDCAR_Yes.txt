            Let me be perfectly honest with you folks out there.   My 1993 Ford Escort wagon was not my first choice of automobiles when I was shopping for a new vehicle seven years ago.  So why did I buy it?  Well to make a long story short I was at a Ford Dealership for routine maintenance on another Ford product that I had leased.  Suddenly I saw this very nice looking 6 feet 2 inch male get out what appeared to be a very small white Ford Escort wagon.  I wanted to strike up a little conversation with this nice looking man so I asked him about his vehicle.  I�ve been in love ever since (with my Escort Station Wagon not the guy�we never got farther than that day�s informative conversation on the Escort - -smile).

Bessie (as my family affectionately calls this car) has proven to be a trust worthily and dependable compact vehicle.  I have not spent money for major repairs on this vehicle (ie engine and transmission work).  I have spent a few dollars for routine maintenance to replace items such as the brakes, timing change, struts, clutch, etc.  Which to me is pretty amazing since I have put way over 130,000 miles on this car since I drove it off the dealership lot.  

My Escort�s 1.9 liter four cylinder electronic fuel injected engine has gotten me from point A to point B quickly and it�s not a gas-guzzler. I have traveled from Detroit to Chicago and back to Detroit on a tank and a half of gas (before the gas prices started going through the roof).  The 1993 Ford Escort�s unibody construction (the frame and body is one piece instead of the body being bolted to the frame) makes the ride surprisingly comfortable and the car itself more stable. Even my boyfriend who is a Chevy guy has admitted that my little Escort is a good riding car.

But wait folks, I�m not done talking about my love affair with this vehicle.   My main reason for keeping this car for so long is�CARGO SPACE!  The 1993 Ford Escort Station Wagon has a 60/40-rear passenger seat and can carry its weight in gold.  I have transported a dryer from Chicago to Detroit, moved a washer from cross-town and even had 2 by 4 lumber ride as an passenger from time to time. 

I love this car and plan to drive it till it won�t drive any more.  My 1993 Ford Escort has turned out to be a bargain when I purchase it for around $11,000 seven years ago.  It is still a bargain if you purchase it use for it�s blue book value of around $2,500 today.   I recommend this car to anyone looking for a little more than you will pay for.
