            Living in a rural area and wanting reliable transportation I went shopping for a Chevy Blazer. Lo and behold there is one that was just traded in for a new one. Being  a Chevy man my whole life I figured this was the one for me. Wrong!! The thing rode like a lumber wagon plus I was looking for something with a little more room. Up pops this '92 Ford Explorer. Two tone brown, good body, powerful V-6. Let's take a drive. Three years later this truck has been a workhorse. I drive it every day for, pleasure, plus the best part has been moving my daughter to college. I can get just about everything inside this explorer, to make it in one trip. If I had bought the Blazer, I would have had to make 2 trips if not 3 to get the same amount to my daughters school. Only complaints are that the thing is sometimes difficult to work on, plus the gas mileage could be a little better.<br><br>
