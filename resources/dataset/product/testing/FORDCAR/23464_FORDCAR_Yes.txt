            Recently, we bought a Y2K Taurus for my wife.  After owning three previous Tauruses, we expected to be happy...and we almost are.  This car is an example of evolution, rather than revolution.  It still uses the 3.0 V6, albeit more refined.  Handling is good.  Fit and finish is as good or better than anything made in the US.  Mileage is satisfactory, as is pickup, braking and other driveability issues.

Why have they almost got it right?  Ford has messed with some real comfort issues.  First, the upper door jamb has been redesigned to smack tall people in the head.  Admittedly, I'm big (6'-4&quot;, 275), but I never had trouble getting into our '87,91 or 94.  Ford has also reengineered the interior so that passenger room in the front seat is smaller.  The driver side entry is better, because the power seat can be adjusted lower, but I seldom drive, but usually ride.  

Ford has also gone to the coded ignition key.  While this might be a great theft deterrent, don't ever lose one.  The replacement must come from the dealer and costs about $120.00.  Hell, I'd almost rather they'd steal the car than lose the key.

I've enjoyed every Taurus we've owned, but I think that Ford could have achieved the new body style (which is actually longer than the old one) and still made it an easy to enter and exit car.  They could have left me with legroom.  This is supposed to be a standard size car, but it's not what I'd consider to be standard sized.  The similarly sized Chevy Impala gives much more ease of entry and interior room.  It's a shame that the Chevy is a piece of junk.  <br><br>
