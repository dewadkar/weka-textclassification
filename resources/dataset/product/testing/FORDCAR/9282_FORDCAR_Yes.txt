            I have to confess something to everyone. I really don't know anything about cars. Like two weeks ago, I just learned how to check the fluids and replace the windshield wipers, that's how bad I am. I was thinking of going to that APEX technical school in New York City that they advertise on daytime TV, just so I can learn how to fix my own car, and appreciate some of the finer intricacies of automotive technology. Maybe next year.

We rented the Ford Contour because our old Volvo was in the shop. The first thing I noticed was that it had very lousy gas mileage. I remember somebody else on epinions.com quoted 25 miles to the gallon. I wouldn't be surprised if that was accurate. Even our 1986 Volvo Station wagon has better engine efficiency than that. In this age of expanding gas prices, you really don't need a gas guzzler. And in my opinion, anything under 30 miles to the gallon is most probably a gas guzzler. Even a BMW, the pinnacle of automotive perfection, averages 30 miles per gallon (this stat is for the 330i, i assume they are more or less with varient models).

Other than that, I didn't have any major problems. One day, two of my friends and I wanted to go out to an event taking place at a Hare Krishna farm commune in Western Pennsylvania. I drove there all the way from western Suffolk County, Long Island (NY). I didn't have to refuel on the way, but I only had 1/8th of a tank when I got there. Luckily, gas there is an amazing $1.40 per gallon. Middle America might get boring at times, but in this respect, it rules.

Some complain about a sedan/sports car hybrid, but in my opinion, it is a good idea. I managed to get from NYC to western Pennsylvania in 3 hours, thanks to the high speed capability of the Ford Contour. At one point I was going 100 mph, but most of the time I had cruise control at 90 mph, without a complaint (except from my friends, who swore I was going to get caught by the police -- but I didn't! Ha-ha!).

Weaving from lane to lane, passing car after car, I felt like I was in one of those BMW commercials -- oh wait a second, BMW commercials usually have the car driving in some obscure windy mountain road in some obscure German town called something like Veinersteinerhazeldorf, but if the people at BMW USA would make commercials based on my example of reckless driving and passing people on the road, I do think they'd sell more cars.

On a side note, I would like to try and rent a BMW next time (maybe go on a trip to see my friend on the boring marine base in south carolina?), and try and go 140 mph on the I-95, while playing a tape of Kenny Logins' &quot;Danger Zone&quot; on maximum volume. That should be fun, until the local sheriff of some backwater southern town pulls us over and puts us in jail and sets the bail to $800.00. &quot;Sheriff Hoss, excuse me sir, do you take Mastercard?&quot;

On one hitch, the night before we left Pennsylvania, I went to a very dark driveway to go to a friend's house there, and I stupidly backed out of the driveway into a cement block (why a huge cement block was out there in the middle of farmland remains to be seen). It screwed up our wheel alignment badly. I was so afraid to take this thing on the highway. I went to the nearby temple and prayed for a safe journey home, and sure enough, our wheel alignment was fixed by early morning. At this point, my carhorn worked as well, which was ridiculously funny because when I rented this thing a month prior to that, the carhorn was completely dead, and it stayed in this condition until that morning. The moral of this story? Don't expect divine intervention to fix all your wheel alignment problems.

The bottom line? Sport sedans are neat, because you can drive really fast, all while seating four fairly comfortably. But complications such as lousy gas mileage, poor durability, and poor designing (oval cars where you can't put stuff on the dashboard really suck), make this car an overall mixed bag. I'd rather drive this thing than a Kia or a Hyundai, but overall, I do think I want to save up for a BMW, or at least some kind of economy car with excellent gas mileage. I probably shouldn't be driving like a crazy maniac (or that NASCAR guy Jeff Gordon, take your pick) on the freeway.<br><br>
