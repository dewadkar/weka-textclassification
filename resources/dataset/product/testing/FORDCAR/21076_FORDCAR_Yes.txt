            In 1993 we bought a brand new Mercury Villager, which I loved for over 122,000 miles. Toward the end of its life with me there were some small problems (the rear air stopped working, the half-shafts were worn out) but I always said I would gladly buy another Mercury...that is, until I got my new Windstar SEL!!!!!

I am very fortunate, this car was a gift from my father, so I don't even have a monthly payment to complain about. My van is named VanGogh (or, Van-GO!), since my Villager had been named Van Morrison. It is a beautiful sort of metallic olive green color, with tan leather interior, captains chairs, an upgraded sound system, dual air, and the automatic dual sliding doors. While it did take a few days to figure out which button to push to open up the left or right doors on my remote, I have nothing bad to say about this system. My Mercury was nice, but in comparison, this is a luxury van. We live in Las Vegas, where superb air conditioning is a requirement, and  I set the rear air to the 2nd fan, the front to the 3rd, and my kids are constantly telling me to turn the air down. The automated dashboard reminds me when I need gas, and checks all fluid levels automatically. There is great cargo space in the back, and the captains chairs keep my kids separated enough that they no longer draw blood in traffic. 

On the road, the van is whisper quiet and extremely comfortable. I get almost 400 miles per tank of fuel, and at $1.75/gallon, I need the best mileage I can find. Even using both air conditioners doesn't seem to effect the mileage. The paint job is clear and bright, and mine came with chrome Ford rims. I almost feel like I have a Mercedes van, so I can't complain. I have read several other of the anti-Windstar reviews, and I think those people simply got a bad car. With my extended warranty, I am covered through 95,000 miles, so for a family, I highly recommend this vehicle. It is stylish, affordable, comfortable, and roomy (I have to transport my hockey-playing son and all of his equipment, and we have ample room for everything and everyone). I recommend this van with 5+ stars!!!
