            I bought a truck because I am precisely the kind of man who is not likely to buy a truck.  Let me rephrase that:  I am not the kind of man who people would begin to suspect to have an inkling about considering buying a truck.  I teach English at a prep school in a big metro area, I have cats, and I live in an apartment at a place with palm trees and a pool.

And yet, something about a truck--not an SUV, mind you--but a truck with a cab and a flatbed and a trailer hitch on the back.  Something about the general shape of the truck and the thrust of its design drew me to it.

Then my father-in-law loaned me his boat and had to get something I could haul it around with.  So a-truck shopping I went, skipping merrily all the way!

In looking over the reports on carious publications and on the web and in pricing out used and new trucks, I decided that I wanted to go with a domestic model, which meant of course Ford, Chevrolet, or Dodge.  The Dodges I drove didn't do a whole lot for me, the ride seemed a little skittish, and the general consensus among the powers that be was that Dodges were a cut below the other two makes.

I liked most of the Chevys I drove--the S-10s in particular--but the models I looked at were a little too tricked up or a bit overvalued as used vehicles, and I would say that people must have been overpaying for the Chevys on the whole.  They hold their value, I understand, but I didn't feel quite right about the price I was being asked to pay and the hard-line the dealers were taking with vehicles with the years and mileage I was looking at.

Which brought me to the Ford Ranger, since the 150s and up were certainly more than I needed.  The ride was nice and light and powerful for me, although I sometimes wish I'd gotten a V6 rather than a V4.  Overall though, the truck is powerful enough for what I have to move (furniture, big plants, the occasional boards for building stuff) or for what I have to pull (a 15-foot boat).  The value was very good for what I got, and even the Rangers hold their price fairly well.  You can always trade your model in for a newer one after a year or two.

I have just the cab with no bench in back, and it's a little cramped for family traveling, of course, but usually it's just me up there by myself.  There's enough room for whatever groceries I buy or stuff I need to keep locked up.  You can always add a lockbox in the bed, as well.

One thing with the model I have, the window in the back of the cab is a little less-than-rugged, and I did have one time when the molding was pried off and the cab broken into, but I never keep anything in the truck, of course.  And people rarely steal a Ford Ranger, the vehicle is so common.  All in all, it's a good truck for getting me to and from work and a great truck for doing chores and projects on the weekends and vacations.  And you'll always be the first guy called when someone is moving.

The only problem I've had, and I understand this has been something to watch on the Rangers, is that the transmission will burn out from time to time.  I myself have been through one--but it was under warranty and cost me just the inconvenience and embarrassment of driving a Probe for a few days.  So be sure when you're buying new to get a long warranty, and if you're buying used you get the dirt on the transmission.

Tell them I said so.  I may teach English, but I know that the transmission on a Ranger is bound to give you trouble at least once.<br><br>
