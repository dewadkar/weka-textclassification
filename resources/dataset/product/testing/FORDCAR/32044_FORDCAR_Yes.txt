            We bought a 1996 Ford Explorer new because my husband had always wanted one.  I was not happy to trade in my mini van and wasn't thrilled with the idea of an SUV.  Boy was I wrong!  I love it!  It's roomy, comfortable and very easy to drive. I don't feel like I'm driving a truck. I love the fact that I can store the groceries in the back and have even more room than I did in my mini van!  The kids are comfortable in the back seat.  It's roomy.  I have two teenagers and a carseat and they are all comfortable back there.  The leg room is great, of course.  I like the fact that the back seat folds down all the way or partial (depends on what you need) for that extra room for hauling. It's very easy to drive and maneuver.  In the four years we've had our Explorer the only thing we've had to do to it is tires (it seems to go through the ones it came with very quickly) and the thermostat for heat.  That's pretty good for a four year old vehicle!  We had running boards installed to help us get up because I'm short but it only adds to the look.  It's a very sharp looking vehicle and we get compliments on it all the time.  I'd definitely buy one again.<br><br>
