            Well, Here's your lemon story.  I bought a 1995 Mustang (V6) new from the dealer.  I loved the car, the body style, the interior -- everything.  At 2000 miles a fuel injector was replaced.  At 4000 Ford was replacing my engine.  Not to mention the horror story of the dealership wars!  After that it was constant - I had an electrical short in the tape deck that no one could ever find, my oil pressure guage didn't work and was replaced, the emergency brake was replaced and the window mechanism was replaced 3 times and I still had problems.  Needless to say, the car was eventually bought back and I received a 1998 Mustang V6.  I've had this Mustang for almost 2 years and no problems yet.  Definately love the car.  Now the only drawback is the snow and ice - mustangs are sleds in the winter!<br><br>
