            What a sporty little car!  It looks cool and drives great.  This little baby caught my eye as soon as it came off Ford's assembly line 3 years ago.  Sporty, yet economical, it's a great budget buy for a young person.  The body styling is aggressive and stylish, with the headlights and tail lights adding a real head-turning appeal.  Where else have you ever seen  headlights like these?  

The small, compact body gives it great maneuverability.  It has the ability to slip in and out of small spaces like city parking lots or a packed highway without having to worry whether your back end is clearing any obstacles. Steering is easy and responsive and side and rear views are unobstructed.  Gauges, dials, and controls have been placed well and are somewhat reminiscent of the Taurus.  The interior is comfy, but nothing to shout about.  It is an economy car, and there will be some give and take.  It's a nice, comfortable interior though the seats have a few lumps that could get uncomfortable on long drives.  The backseat is rather exceptional for a compact sport coupe.  Two average-size adults could fit rather comfortably, though getting in and out is a squeeze.

Gas mileage is a respectable 22 to 25 mpg, and with gas prices going even higher for the winter, this is extremely important.  

Power is decent.  It doesn't quite live up to it's aggressive appearance, but when compared to another car in it's class, the Honda Civic, the ZX2 holds it's own with a 130 hp engine.  Acceleration is acceptable and on it's way to being impressive for it's class, and braking is good for the more dare-devilish drivers who wait till the last minute. The ride is average for an economy-class vehicle..not exceptionally smooth, but not horrible either.  It has it's share of bumps and rattles and road noise. 

Most ZX2's already come fully equipped, even though most features are optional.  You can get leather seats, full power, CD Player, sunroof, and keyless entry.  It comes in cool colors like yellow, green, or midnight blue, as well as the more traditional colors like black or silver. 

Cargo room is ok, but the back seat folds down to give you more space.  

I would suggest buying one a year or two old, since at 12k to 15k new it's not quite worth the money (in my opinion) but at 7k to 9k for a 97-98, it's well worth it, especially if you only plan on owning it for a year or two. It is still an escort, and comes with all the little problems escorts have in terms of value loss and relative cheapness, but for the sport appeal, it's a great car for a young person.   <br><br>
