            This is by far the best small car in the market. Do not mistake the hatchback to be a small car. When you park this next to any other sedans or it's category, it is actually bigger. It has the best handling and  cornering of it's class, smooth ride and nice acceleration. It comes with ford's Zetec engine which produces 130hps and 130lbs of torque, overpowering the very popular Civic (except the Si). The interior is perfect fit for the car. Seats are surprisingly comfortable for a car of it's price and it wraps you in. Standard equipment includes CD player and 15" alloys. Fuel economy is ok which gives about 25mpg city and 30 highway. It could get better since my car is still new. It only has 3700 miles and I drive 45 miles to work each way. I average about 80mph and it zips right along smoothly. No rattles, no problems so far except for a recall which was fixed in less than 2 hrs. I paid $12,800 (which includes a $400 recent college grad rebate) out the door (including all fees and tax), with a/c as the only option. You can't get another car like this for this price. And why would you want to pay more for the competition if it beats them in all aspects? 

UPDATE: Ok, i've had the car for a year now and here's my accessment. 5 recalls so far. Nothing major. A month after getting the car, I hit a big pot hole one night that i didn't see. It messed up the front passenger side shock and spring. I was surprised that it got messed up but i guess I hit pretty hard. A few months ago, I needed to get both rear shocks and springs replaced too, under warranty. Weird thing is, I didn't hit any pot holes this time. It just started rattling anytime the car went over bumps. A couple times, the gas gauge didn't work. It would stay at the E mark even after i filled up the tank. When I first took the car out of the dealer's lot, i noticed a grinding noise whenever I tried to make an extreme left turn (U-turn). Dealer check it out twice and claimed they didn't find anything. Finally i showed them the problem and they found the power steering pump was damaged. I wouldn't base the quality of the Focus on one ZX3. This could jsut have been my car. Maybe it wasn't transported carefully.
Even through all these problems, I still love the car. Everything's been fixed under warranty. I don't know of any cars at my price range that's as fun to drive. It looks cool and i love the interior. Stock radio system is great too. The best feature is that you can turn on the radio (with timer set for 1hr) even without the car keys.
