                As an owner of 5 speed 1994 Ford Probe GT, I have always had my eye on Ford Sports cars.  Recently I as the new 1999 Mustang was revealed to the public, I decided to do a little test driving.  I was extremely impressed with the cars visual design, so much so I at first considered trading in my car for one just based on looks.  That was before I got in though.  Although the design of the interior is stylish and well planned, it is unoriginal and almost identical to previous years.  Almost every one I looked at on the lot I visited was automatic which was a big minus, and the gearshift in the manual ones looked funny as it was too close to the dash and bent up at a strange angle.
     Next was the road test.  Of course I had to drive a 5.0.  I was immediately impressed by the cars speed, performance, and acceleration, but was immediately turned of to its poor handling.  I found my Probe to have much more precise steering than the Mustang.  In addition, while the mustang my win in the long run, I could easily keep up with most models of the Mustang as my Probe has excellent acceleration too.  Acceleration in the Mustang should be far superior to other cars.  The Mustang is a legend and Ford needs to stop relying on the name and looks to sell it.  I have seen a lot of dissapointment in recent years in all sports cars.  While Mustang is still top of the line in my opinion, it could be a lot better.<br><br>
