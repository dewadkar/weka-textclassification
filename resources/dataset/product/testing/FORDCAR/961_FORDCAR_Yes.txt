            A few years ago, after borrowing my dad�s truck to go to the dump or haul even the smallest of cargo from Home Depot, I had finally reached the boiling point, and decided it was time for a truck. So, after a few weeks of looking and researching, I bought a 1999 Chevy S10 extended cab. The truck had 68 miles on it when I drove it off the parking lot, and I felt like the queen of the road. 

So, it was a little bit of a sad moment, when I decided that the S10 was just not for me, and it was time to move on to a bigger truck. Well, actually, it was a combination of factors, many of which had to do with the size of the S10 and it�s ability (or rather lack of) to carry extra passengers. After hearing countless complaints from passengers who were forced to ride in the back of the cab (in the �jump seats�, as they are known), I realized that they were cramped and unsafe if I were to have an accident. 

The bottom line: I wanted a <I>real</I> truck, one that could haul things and would have a larger cab for passengers. Oh yeah, and since my partner and I are trying to have a baby, the extended cab had to have plenty of room to safely accommodate a carseat.

I started looking on the internet, and I had narrowed my search down to one vehicle: a 1997 or newer Ford F150, two wheel drive. I checked NADA prices, shopped around, test drove dozens of trucks, kicked many tires, and listened to more sales pitches than I care to count. So after doing all this research, I am happy to report that I am now a proud owner of a <b>2000 Ford F150 SuperCab</b>. 

I was able to pick up this truck for about $3,500.00 under NADA book price, but had to forgo a few �wants� to get it, and the truck I finally purchased has the following:

XLT edition
Extended cab
5 speed (with overdrive)
6 cylinder (4.2 EFI liter engine)
2 wheel drive

Granted, in my dreams, I would have preferred to get a Triton V8 (which is either a 4.6 or a 5.4 liter engine), with an automatic transmission. However, I figured since all of my vehicles since I was 19 have been stick shifts, this one probably would be just fine. Besides, I don�t plan on hauling a trailer or boat, and I am not in the business of towing a trailer full of cows or llama�s, so I really didn�t need the extra power that the Triton engines offer. Sure, the resale value on an automatic with a V8 is higher, but since I was planning on keeping this truck �until it dies�, I figured that these two options really wouldn�t matter in 10 years. 

<b>Power</b> -  As I mentioned, the truck has a V6, 4.2 liter engine instead of the Triton V8. I was a bit concerned with power, as the dry weight of the F150 is around 4,500 pounds, but I have found that the 5 speed tranny really works well with such a �small� engine, as you have more control over the RPM�s. Need more power? Simply downshift if you are in town, or step on the pedal to pass, the engine has plenty of power to get up the steepest grades and will not disappoint when you are in need of a quick lane change.

Another thing I like about this truck is that the gearing is very high, and allows you to drive at a lower gear, in a higher RPM range, which results in more power. This is especially helpful if you are doing city driving, as you don�t have to shift as much as you would expect. In the mileage department, the 2000 Ford F150 is listed as getting 16 mpg city, and 21 mpg on the highway, with an estimated yearly fuel cost of just over $1000.00. Of course, those with lead foots can expect to spend much more at the pump. 

The engine also features a �fail safe� cooling system, and will run on three cylinders, and then alternate between the other three, in the event of the engine overheating. And while the truck itself will probably be gutless, this features does allow you to at least get to a service station, without blowing up your engine. As far as towing capacity is concerned, the F150 is rated to pull 4,000 pounds. 

<b>Options galore</b> - Okay, I will be the first to admit it. I <I>really</I> wanted something with �power everything� and cruise control, so I opted for the XLT package (note: the XL package is more of a work truck, with manual windows and locks). Besides power locks, mirrors, and windows, the XLT package includes a tilt steering wheel, A/C, and cruise control. This package added about $600.00 to the price of the truck, and was well worth it, as they really give the truck a true feeling of a car, in terms of amenities. Also included in this package is an AM/FM cassette player. There is an optional factory CD changer available, but I highly recommend forgoing this option, and going with a 3rd party stereo and changer. 

Safety features include restraints for six people, as well as a driver and passenger side airbags. For those who want to put a small child or smaller adult in the front, the passenger side airbag can be disabled by using the key on the front panel of the dashboard. 

<b>Interior</b> - As I mentioned, a big concern for me was the seating for passengers, especially in the back or extended part of the cab. So, while truck shopping one day, I had a friend bring a few of his sons carseats, and I am happy to report that there was plenty of room in the back seat, which is a bench seat that fold up for extra storage in an �80 � 20� fashion. Room wise, the backseat is very generous, and can seat three adults, facing forward, comfortably and safely. 

The front seats are the �60 � 40� bench style, which a fold down console in the middle that allows for extra storage, or a sixth passenger. There is an option for power seats, but these are on the cabs with the �captains chairs�, which are more common on the V8. Besides, I figure after nearly 20 years of driving, manually adjusting my seat really wasn�t going to be that difficult, nor was it worth the extra $250.00 for this option. 

As for comfort, the seats are extremely comfortable, and feature a lumbar support in the drivers seat. The material for the seats is a cloth/velour, which looks nice and wears fairly well. Still, I am going to pick up a set of seat covers from the upholstery so as to save the wear and tear on them.

Another thing that really impressed me about this truck is the amount of storage space. As I mentioned, the back seats (which are accessible by opening the back two doors on the extended cab), also fold up, offering space for hauling groceries and items that might slide around in the bed. Besides this, there are two storage compartments in the overhead console (which also includes a compass and an outside temperature gauge), as well as the center console, and all of the doors, included those on the extended cab. Another nice touch are two standard sized cup holders, as well as a smaller one, intended to hold smaller cups, such as coffee. 

<b>Handling</b> - Honestly, the 2000 Ford F150 handles extremely well and provides a very comfortable ride, even on the bumpiest of roads. Steering and acceleration are very responsive, and the truck really feels more like a luxury car, as the suspension really soaks up the road. Believe me, trucks have came quite a long way, really are more like cars with a bed, as this one is. 

<b>Warranty</b> - The 2000 Ford F150 comes with a standard 36 month, 36,000 mile warranty, whichever comes first. Also included in this is roadside assistance in the event of a breakdown, flat, or lockout.

I should also mention that there is a theft prevention system on the F150, which features a coded key system. This feature allows the ignition to be started with only a special key, thus preventing (ideally) the truck from being stolen. I highly suggest storing the spare key in a safe place, as replacements keys (I am told) are a costly $50.00. 

<b>Overall thoughts</b> - After looking for this truck, and despite it being used, I am quite happy with it, and am looking forward to many years of driving it. I was a bit concerned with the engine being �only a V6�, but am confident that it will well serve my needs of commuting and the weekly trips to Home Depot. Those looking to safely travel with a few kids while hauling something in the bed of the truck need look no more than to the 2000 Ford F150.

As always, thanks for reading!
