            The Explorer is the best equipped, most reliable, and the most comfortable in its class.

When my wife and I decided to buy and SUV we looked at them all: the Rodeo, Pathfinder, Blazer, and 4Runner.  Although the Pathfinder and 4Runner were very nice they just couldn't touch the complete package offer by the Explorer.

I have a 9-month-old and a dog.  The Explorer makes traveling them the two of them a breeze.  The carseat fits great in the back; and  the dog loves being out of the weather.  My wife loves how easy it is to get the stroller in and out of the explorer vs. the Ford Contour.

For value, comfort, resell value, and safety look no further than the Ford Explorer.
