            I purchased my Windstar in 1996.  It was a year old.  It had only been used as a rental, and so for a '95 model was practically brand new. I believe at the time we paid $15,000.00 for it and have never regretted it.<br><br>My family was just beginning to grow and still has plans of growing so we needed something more reliable that the little Ford Mustang we had, (I love my mustang!) and more roomy.  We lived in Texas and had family in <br>Missouri and Oklahoma so needless to say we were making a lot of long trips.<br><br>I fell instantly in love with my Windstar the moment I saw it and new it was <br>for me when I sat behind the wheel.  It is the most comfortable vehicle I <br>have ever had or hope to have.  At first I wanted a full size conversion van and was disappointed at the idea purchasing a mini-van, but my Ford<br>Windstar changed all that.<br><br>My Ford Windstar gets almost as good a gas mileage as my Mustang and <br>has an even smoother ride.  It rides just like a car.  I especially like the way the dash slopes back giving it not only a classical look but also a very comfortable foot rest on long otherwise dreary road trips.  <br><br>My Windstar seats 7 or 8 adults comfortably and has multiple cup holders <br>around the van.  <br><br>My Windstar is also just a plain good looking van.  It's white with red <br>pin stripes and has a beautiful blue interior that is very resistant to wear.<br>I love it.  It's part of the family.<br>  <br><br><br><br>
