            I purchased a 98 Windstar in Spring of 1997 and now have 50,000 miles on it.  I did not get a Dodge after having put a transmission in our last one (1994)(so did everyone else I knew).  I liked the extra room however we have had many minor problems.  For one thing the wheels can not be balanced (2 new sets of tires, several balances, trip to dealer under warranty did not help).  Currently the brake light is always on, they cruise control quit working, the seat panel fell off, and the rear heat operation is sporadic.  I still have my 94 van and it drives smoother than the Windstar.  Next time I will return to Dodge and just plan on putting in a new transmission at 50,000 miles.     <br><br>
