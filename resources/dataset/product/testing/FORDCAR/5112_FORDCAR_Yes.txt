            Purchased this car in July of 1997.  I loved this car.  Of all the cars I have ever owned, it was a favorite.  Its manufacture date was 10/96, so it had been in inventory for a while, so got a good deal.  The MSRP was 24,350.  If looking around, keep in mind that the LX was top of the line for 86-98.  In 99-current, it is the base model.  (What was Ford marketing thinking.) I liked the design of this auto, contrary to public opinion.  It had all options except sunroof.  The DOHC 3.0 V-6 ran really smooth.  In 97 it was rated at 200hp.  It was quite, rode well, tight body, and had no squeaks.  The reliability was great.  We never had any problems with the car.  We had to sell it to my aunt when our family exceeded five.  She still owns it and loves it.  My wifeï¿½s heart sinks whenever she sees it.  Great car!  You can get a slightly used one for a great price due to the fact that Ford has flooded the market with this automobile.<br><br>
