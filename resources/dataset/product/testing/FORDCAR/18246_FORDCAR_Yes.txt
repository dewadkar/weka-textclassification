            Okay.  I've owned my 1991 Ford Escort Pony since 1994.  Only now am I selling it.  I bought it in 1994 at age 17 for about $5500.  It looked fancier than it actually was with a maroon paint job and pinstripes (apparently common on the otherwise stripped down Pony).  The car had about 25,000 miles on it at that point in time.  Now, keep in mind that there is NOTHING electronic on my Pony (we're talking it didn't even come with a radio OR a passenger side mirror) so those kinds of issues couldn't arise.  Also, so far as other options go, it is a 5-speed manual with no power steering.  Well, I haven't ever had any problems.

My 'scort as it's known as, survived four Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan winters with little wear.  It's bounced down hundreds (if not thousands) of miles of dirt roads with little damage.  Even more importantly, it survived me...a teen driver and me a college students.  Amazing if you ask me.  

I've only had a few problems with it, most caused by me.  I replaced two clutches.  The first burned out like five years ago and the second was faulty.  And, fortunately, at no time have I been left out in the cold or for that matter stranded by the old 'scort.  In fact, it still starts on the first try every time to this very day.  Impressive, I must say, for a serious budget vehicle.  I just had to also replace the alternator.  And, to be quite honest that's all for mechanical problems that I've had with the car.

This car also has survived spinning out on I-75 during a blizzard, snapping a stop sign in half (it didn't even get a scratch), two hit and run accidents (the other drivers ran), a few fender benders, and a hail storm.  The worst?  The hail storm.  It totalled my car.  In fact, my insurance company was the only one fixing the vehicles.  It did $2500 in damage on a vehicle worth $2200.  

So far as comfort goes, as with any small economy car the back seat isn't the most comfortable, but I have to say that it is fine for short or medium-length trips.  Also, the front seats are standard bucket seats.  Nothing special with no extra padding at all.  As I've mentioned earlier, my particular model has no options.  There's not air conditioning, power locks, power doors, power steering, a passenger side mirror, and I had to install a stereo.  But, all-in-all, it was a great bargain and a great car for me.  

So, now I own a 10-year-old Escort Pony with a lot of miles on it.  The body looks fine and it is rusting mainly under the Ford sign on the trunk (a common place).  There is a nest of hornets living in the frame.  But, besides that it has new tires and is up for sale.  $1500 OBO anyone?

I wouldn't suggest buying one of these at this point in time because of the age of the vehicle, but to be quite honest it was and still is a pretty darned good economy car.
