            If you need a dependable station wagon then the Ford Taurus is the one I recommend.It is roomy in every aspect.It is very comfortable on long trips and I have even slept in mine.The gas mileage has been excellent and the only repair I have done is replaced the transmission after 174,000 miles.This has been as good as car as you could ask for.My Taurus is total electric with power everything.I really just don't know what else to say about this great car!I bought this car used from a friend for 300.00 and it has giving me my money's worth.I highly believe in this car and I would recommend it to anyone. My wife survived a head on wreck in her Ford Taurus wagon like mine.This is the car for this family.  <br><br>
