            My father and I purchased a '96 Ford F-150 XLT because he wasn't comfortable with the body style of the '97s. We didn't get many options, primarily the 5.0L V-8, power controls, captain's chairs with a fold-down arm-rest in the center seat. We also got 4WD, A/C and a cassette player.

Since I don't like chrome, the dealer graciously swapped the front grill for the solid black one from a lesser model.

Thought the engine struggles to speed (it has 225hp, but doesn't feel well matched to the transmission) the load capacity is pretty impressive. I've hauled over a ton of sod in the back and noticed only that the braking was a bit longer.

The stock tires and chrome wheels were a little lame (seemed tiny in the wheel wells) so we quickly swapped them out for some Michelin LTX A/Ts and some new aluminum wheels.

The A/C has an odd habit of switching to the floor or windshield vents when going up a steep incline. I don't know why this is unless there's a vacuum problem.

Three main gripes that may not be deal breakers: Things just don't want to stay on the shallow bucket seats. If you go down any sort of an hill, expect them to fall to the floor (and possibly under your brake pedal. Stuff also tends to fall between the seats and it's much more difficult to retrieve items than in most cars. The seats are fairly comfortable and the inflatable lumbar bubble is a little helpful. Second gripe: there are no notches to hold the doors open if you are parked on the side of a hill. It is very awkward if you have your hands full, to open the door and hold it open while putting your load into the cab. Finally, there is no lip in the footwells to keep things on the floor from rolling out when you open the door on an hillside. This is probably to keep the step in from being even higher, but it makes opening the door a test of dexterity when you have loose soft drink bottles or something that might roll sitting on the floor.

Reliability-wise, the truck has been dependable, though it is not a primary vehicle for either of us and hasn't gotten many miles. The ride is a little rough, but not terribly so.

If you plan to load mulch or dirt in the vehicle, be sure you cover the tailgate hinges while loading. Debris can easily get caught in the hinge and make it difficult to close.

Small people might have trouble finding a good driving position without electric seats (ours are manual). They might also have difficulty getting in--it's quite a step up with not much to grab onto. The lack of door hinges can make this even more of a problem.

The center armrest console is handy and holds tapes, spare change and two drinks (nothing too tall, though.)

The radio is sufficient, but we just took the base cassette player.

There is a fair amount of storage space behind the seats, enough for an aftermarket wedge-shaped cargo box we picked up.

We didn't cross-shop the Chevrolet very closely since neither of us liked the interior, but in hindsight, the Chevy's might have been more functional. We both liked its exterior more than the Ford.

In summary, aside from those minor inconveniences, it's been a good truck and we have been pleased with its utility. Hey, it's a truck, not a luxury car!
