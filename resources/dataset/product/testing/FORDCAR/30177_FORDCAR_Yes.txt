            I've had my Escape XLS V6 for 7,000 miles now.  It's a company car, so I don't necessarily bear the weight of sticker shock, but it also gives me an opportunity to view it in a neutral mindset.

My car cost $25,800 sticker, and came with the usual XLS package plus the in-dash 6-disc changer (automatic sunroof, cruise, etc.)  The only option I didn't get was leather, mainly because the upholstery was so nice it seemed like overkill.  The seats are very comfortable.  I'm 6'0" and 240 lbs. and I still feel like there's room all around.  The power seats offer plenty of adjustment and legroom, and all the controls are in easy reach.  The gauges are well-lit and have a cool black on white effect that is hard to explain but easy on the eyes day and night.

The ride is good for a small sport-ute - you'd really think this car has a longer wheelbase.  My other car is a '98 Accord EX Coupe, and I would say the ride is obviously softer but very similar in most other respects.  We live in NEast PA, so we get our share of snow and ice, and so far the 4WD has worked well both in auto and manual.

My only issues so far are minor.  There is a decent amount of wind noise on the highway - most of it from the shape of the front windshield - but it's only noticeable in complete quiet, so a radio or passenger can drown it out.  Also, the gas mileage can vary if you're heavy on the accelerator, as I have a tendency to be.  The V6 is pretty responsive, but you can suck the gas down if you gun it too much.

Overall, this is a good car, and once my company takes it back I might consider getting one for myself.

One cautionary note:  I have the 6-disc in-dash changer.  It broke in December.  It is now March and I am still waiting for the replacement.  Although Ford has repeatedly told me they will fix it under warranty, I would strongly recommend you look at an aftermarket radio if you like this in-dash concept.  I have heard nothing but bad things about the changer, but it shouldn't take away for the quality of the car as a whole, which I would rate as quite good.
