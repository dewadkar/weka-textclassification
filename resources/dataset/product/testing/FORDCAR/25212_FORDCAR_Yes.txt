            I love my 1997 Splash. I have owned it since it was a newborn, and even specified its exact build. However, it is not without its problems (afterall, it is, ahem, a Ford...). Here is what I think.

THE BASICS

My truck is 4WD, with the sport suspension package and the towing payload package. This means it sits a little higher, and rides a little smoother than a similar Splash without these options. I highly recomend the sport suspension package, as it makes the ride much less truck-like. I chose the purple color (called sapphire blue), but that is of minimal importance. (although it gets me lots of compliments). 

THE GOOD STUFF

My truck is small, which is good for me, being 5 feet tall. Conversely, it sits high, which is also good for my short stature-- I have very few blind spots and can see ahead in front of other cars. It also gets better gas mileage than larger trucks- about 22 mpg average, 19 mpg in the city.

The 4WD has come in handy many a time in my snowy climate, as has the antilock brake action. Neither has failed me yet in 5 years. The sport suspension makes for a smooth ride, especially in "off road" conditions. I haven't actually used the towing package, but it has added noticeable low-speed power, as when driving up steep hills in snowy conditions. 

The truck bed as come in handy over the years- I've gone through 3 in-town moves of my own, and several friends' as well. I am proud to say that I have moved entire households in the bed of my small truck! (albeit over several trips!). 

The front seating area is roomy enough for me- I do not have any type of extended cab, and there is ample storage space behind the seats for things such as gym bags, book bags, shopping bags, and the like. It would be difficult to store anything larger there, or anything that is too rigid. However, it is a truck, and front storage capacity is not a selling feature. On the subject of seats, I have the 60/40 split bench. This means the driver seat is connected to the middle seat. This never made much sense to me, as whoever sits in the middle has to sit as close to the dash as I do, which is pretty darn close. It seems like it would make more sense to have the "60" portion be on the passenger side.

My truck has held up well over the years. I have had no major repairs- my anti-lock brake line came unhinged once, and had to be bolted back into place, and a bad transmission cleaning resulted in cracked washer that cost about $100 to replace, and thats about it. I did get the free replacement tires in the Firestone scandal, which was a nice bonus.

THE BAD STUFF

Nothing great is without its downside, and my truck is no exception. Although I mentioned gas mileage as one of the good features, I'll mention it again here. It IS a truck, and 19 mpg may be more than some are willing to live with. Turn on the 4WD, and you can almost see the gas guage falling. 

In addition, Rangers are compact trucks. This means you dont get all the bed space of a full-size. The Splash, in particular, loses even more bed space due to its flared wheel beds. This is not a major problem, it just means you can fit less in a load. Also, the bed can be hard to unload- it isnt difficult to chuck things in, but due to the high sides, it is sometimes difficult to reach things that are sitting low in the bed- I usually need to step up on the side steps to reach in.

Of course, the interior space can be cramped if you are a larger person, or if you are riding 3 deep. That is definately not comfortable for more than a few minutes, even though I am not a very large person.  Other things to note are that my "premium" stereo system was hardly that (it would probably be more worthwhile to buy your own system), and the lack of power seat controls.

SPECIFICS

My truck is a 97 Ranger Splash in Sapphire Blue. It has a 4 liter, v6 engine, with the sport-suspension, off-road, and payload towing packages, in 4WD. Extras include the premium sound system, 60/40 split bench, power windows/locks, theft-detterant system, and bed liner.
