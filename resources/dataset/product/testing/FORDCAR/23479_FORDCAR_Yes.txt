            Reliability: Of the 9 new cars I have owned in the past 32 years, including a 5-Series BMW, this is the only one with no (zero) sample defects.  I bought this jewel 2 years ago and have just turned 20,000 miles. So far all is perfect!

This LX(base model) is equipped with an above average sound system that automatically lowers the volume when the engine is stopped, keeping you from having a heart attack when you crank up forgetting that the kid drove last. Power mirrors, power windows, and a good air-conditioner are included as well.

Power: The base model 3.0 V-6 with 150 hp is more than adequate, starts instantly, and runs flawlessly.  Some misfiring at idle began at 15,000 and was remedied with a $2 bottle of injector cleaner.

Handling: The optional 16 in. wheels and high pressure radials give the car a secure feel and this along with totally quiet brakes satisfies me.

Fuel Economy: as per sticker

Headroom:  A lot.  I'm tall, and I'm telling you, it's a lot.

Note:  Quiet- Twice I've cranked it with the engine running, and once in a fast food parking lot, I stopped when a pedestrian was walking backward as he spoke to someone.  He didn't here the engine and walked backward into my stopped car.
 
Stars:  *****
