            I've had my Escort for a little over a year now. I bought it from Hertz, who sells fairly new cars for great prices. My little white Ford Escort was (and still is) my first car, and for a first car, it's great. I know that Escorts have a bad rap from their 80's and early 90's profiles, but after Ford redesigned this little baby for the 97 model year, it blows its ancestors away. 

I didn't buy this vehicle. Sure it was my money spent on it, but my parents chose it. I'm 17 (I got the car when I was 16 and just got my license), what do you expect? For it's price, go for it. I'm on a budget--I have to buy my car, pay for my gas, and pay for my insurance. Nothing was bought for me. I'm not trying to brag or complain, I'm trying to get through to whoever the lucky person is who is reading this to tell them that this car is super affordable! I got a 1998 Escort SE (the top notch model) w/ power everything for under 9k. 

I like most everything about this vehicle. The doors have a guard built in on the lower side which helps to prevent minor dents. The gas mileage isn't too bad--I get an average of 31-33 mpg on mixed highway/city. It's comfy and fairly roomy (even though the back is a little small--but what do you expect w/ a compact car? btw, I'm 5'4&quot;, so this is my opinion--you may have problems if you're 6'+). The trunk is nice and big for mega shopping trips (y'know, to spend all that money you save by buying this car!) and vacations.

However, there are a couple things I don't like. 110-hp is kinda wimpy. I'm a chick w/ an attitude--I'd like a little more power! There isn't a trunk release inside, but hey, it's just extra exercise walking to the back to open the trunk. And the pickup is just a little bit too sloooooow.

Overall, the ride is smooth and the steering is loose enough for movement but tight enough so you don't loose control. It's fun to drive--just don't try to race any sports cars b/c this little baby doesn't have a chance of winning. If you want a good car for under 13k, try this car out. If you can afford something higher up, then go for the more luxurious car. But for me, a first time buyer, this car is great.<br><br>
