            The 1996 Ford F-350 crew cab 4x4 with the power stroke 7.3L diesel is a perfect towing machine for a family of four. This vehicle equipped with a 3.55 transmission ratio is worthy of towing a loaded fifth wheel (around 10,000 lbs.) across the United States and get 11 miles to the gallon. The cab is spacious for all family members and offers the added luxury of pull down arm rests, one in the front seat and one in the back seat. The diesel engine may take some getting used to for those of you not used to the noise but it offers much more power than a gas motor. The truck has a stiff suspension that takes the added weight of the fifth wheel with ease. I found no problems with side sway or pushing when the bigger trucks pass by you as your combined weight is in the area of 17,500 lbs. The truck sits relatively high off the ground and usually requires running boards to be installed. This added height is not a problem with the bigger fifth wheels as the trailer manufacturers are now building higher units that don't require a lift kit to match up to the tow vehicle. This takes some getting used to but after a few pulls you will feel at ease with the height and weight ratio.With all the smaller tow vehicles that are on the road now I highly recommend a truck of this size for stability and protection.   <br><br>
