            Our 1996 Ford Windstar has been in the family since it was new.  It has been a great performing vehicle, serving us well with no significant problems.  Other than a persistant low-frequency "hum" from the engine manifold, no problems.  We have not had to take this vehicle in for any repairs in over 70,000 miles.  The ride has been and continues to be quiet and solid.  We're actually still on the original tires, brakes, plugs and shocks! 

The only problem we have had is a low rumble like hum from the engine upon take off.  We have a 3.8 liter six-cylinder engine and the noise shows up on technical service notices.  However, the dealer just couldn't hear the problem and it's not enough of a bother to fight for a fix.

If you are in the market for a used Windstar, we strongly suggest going for the quad bucket seats if you can find them.  We purchased the regular bench seat in row two, and were very disappointed with the lack of head rests and uncomfortable, flat profile of the seat.  However, we found like new second row buckets removed from a van upon conversion - using ebay.com!  A bid of $125 plus $99 shipping led to the seats, easy installation (had to pull up the carpet to cut from below, but final job looks factory perfect) and great comfort.  The company from Canada selling these second row benches still has several sets on ebay right now - but make sure you get the ones for the right year Windstar!  The body style changed later on to accommodate the second sliding door, so the chair mounts changed too.

Our mileage on regular gas has been 20 to 25 MPG.  These are roomy vans; removing the second and third row seating, we were able to fit an upright piano on its side with no problem. Paint has been solid and durable - we don't wax this vehicle, yet the clearcoat still is clean and has plenty of shine (garage kept).

While the older Windstars may not be the most stylish of the minivans, they are solid and reliable.  It seems that Ford has finally fixed all the leak problems we've experienced on other Ford products.  A big relief.
