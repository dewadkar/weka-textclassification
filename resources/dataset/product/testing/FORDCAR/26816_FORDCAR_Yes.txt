            I recommend the Ford Expedition to everyone I know who is looking for a large car or SUV.  It is reliable, roomy, comfortable.  I bought it to tow a 32' camper.  Of the few vehicles with family seating that are equipped to tow so much weight, the Expedition is the nicest looking and rated the best. It also fits into my garage which also stores an F-150, work bench, two kids' bikes, a fridge and a freezer!  It is a two car garage, really! Ford really does make the best trucks. 

My favorite feature has got to be the movable foot pedals.  My husband does not have to move the seat when he drives it, only the pedals!  There is plenty of room for cargo and passengers, at the same time.  It is just a great family car.  

The one thing that I do not like about it is the gas mileage.  When I first got it, I was getting around 13 mpg around town.  My Expedition is equipped with the average fuel mileage computer and I keep an eye on it.  I have discovered that if I accelerate slowly from a stop, the mileage does not suffer so much.  Now I am getting around 15mpg.  

The four wheel drive model does sit a little higher than the two wheel, so the running boards are a must and anyone who has difficulty climbing should really think about it, but for most people, it is not a problem.

The back seat is great (the middle seat, if all three rows are in).  Three tall adults can sit comfortably...really!  I would buy another one in a heart beat!<br><br>
