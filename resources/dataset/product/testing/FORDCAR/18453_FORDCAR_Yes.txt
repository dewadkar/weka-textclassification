            I recently bought my second Ranger and I love it.  It feels great to drive.  The steering is responsive, the brakes work flawlessly, and it is very reliable.  On top of this, the truck gets good gas mileage, and has good power to boot.  
I owned my first Ranger for more than six years, and it was five years old when I bought it.  In all that time the only major repair I had to do on it was replace a flywheel.  Not too bad if you ask me, considering this truck had more than 100,000 mile on it.  Other than that I did no other work to it other than oil changes, tune ups, and other regular maintenance.  I also knew that I could get in that truck, turn the key, and it would start up and get me where i wanted to go.  How many other people can say that about their vehicle after it has that many miles on it.  Alas it came time to buy a new truck however.  With that great experience I had with my first Ranger I can say that I really only considered getting another Ranger.
As great as  the Ranger is, it is not for everyone.  If you like big trucks, with large powerful motors, then you won't like a Ranger.  Also if you have large items to haul, don't buy a Ranger, get a truck that fits your needs.  Also, if you are a serious off roader, then the Ranger may not be your cup of tea either.  Rangers are light and small, like all compact pick-ups.  These two facts do not make small compact trucks ideal for off-roading.  But if you are a serious off-roader you will more than likely spend more than a Ranger would cost anyway.
If you want a truck that is dependable, need something to haul small things, no larger than furniture, and feels great to drive than a Ranger is in your future.  If you live in regions that receive snowfall than a four-wheel drive Ranger will easily get you around.  Even a two-wheel model will do, just throw some weight in the bed and off you go.<br><br>
