            Here's my two cents on the 1997 Ford Explorer XLT. I've been leasing my vehicle since 12/96, and I've had 45,000 miles worth of interstate, city and country (gravel) road driving. With the end of my lease approaching I've driven a handful of other Explorers. Here's what I've found:

1) the gas mileage stinks - this is a reality of driving truck based SUVs. To complain about this is akin to an Eskimo complaining of snow and cold, gusty winds.  I have driven an average of 15,000 miles per year, and I fill up the tank every 5 to 10 days. This was quite a shock, after driving my '85 Toyota Celica for twelve years, but you get used to it. For what it's worth, the cheapest unleaded gas seems to have no impact on driving performance.

2) On the outside - the paint is holding up very well.  The only problem I've noticed is small areas of rust in the hollow areas inside the front bumper.  I've noticed this on other Explorers, too.  One's opinion of Ford's ovoid styling is quite subjective - I like it fine, but that's me.
The factory tires are still going strong - it looks as if I'll get at least another year out of them.

3) Engine performance - my truck has the SOHC V-6 mated with the 5-speed automatic transmission.  I've driven a '96 V-6 (no SOHC, 4-speed), a '98 V-6 and a '97 V-8.  Acceleration, especially while at highway speeds is MUCH better with the SOHC V-6 and V-8 engines.  The older V-6 engine has nothing left in reserve when you need to pass or merge. It seems to me the SOHC V-6 has as much power as the V-8, and it costs less and has better gas mileage.  I have had no engine-related trouble.


4) On the inside - the upholstery is holding up well, and has been able to hide the myriad small stains that come with everyday driving.  The seats are still very comfortable, and can be adjusted to fit drivers of various height/weight combinations.  The instrument panel is uncluttered, and logically laid out - in fact it's not too far removed from the layout in my old Celica.  The sound system (AM/FM/Cassette/CD changer) sounds excellent, however, occasional annoying pops have plagued my system from the beginning.  The problem is worse with cassettes, and since I usually don't listen to tapes, I haven't pursued this issue.  The CD player is not prone to skipping until you hit big bumps or &quot;washboards&quot; on gravel roads.  The A/C &amp; heater work very well, the interior is never uncomfortable for long.  The rear climate control system is highly recommended if you have frequent back seat passengers.  Controls are large and easy to see, and easy to use, even in the dark.  I've had two mechanical problems: a finicky seat belt latch and the light in the external keyless entry keypad failed - both problems were repaired under warranty.  The keyless entry option is very handy.    Another nice feature is the overhead console which houses an outside thermometer and compass. These things are like power windows and locks, once you've had them you don't want to go without.  The cargo area is immense for a compact SUV and comes with a retractable cover to hide the contents.

5) Driving experience - I've found the Explorer to be more carlike than I initially expected.  My brother-in-law works for Ford and claims the '97 Explorers have the same suspension system as the Lincoln Town Car, but I've not been able to validate this claim.  The handling is fine, and although the manual and visors are emblazoned with warnings about driving SUV's, I've found the transition from a small sports coupe surprisingly easy.  The Explorers sit up high, so you have a commanding view of the road, until an Expedition or tractor-trailer pulls alongside.

While not a true all-wheel drive vehicle, the &quot;Auto&quot; setting always sends at least 10% of drivetrain power to the front wheels.  When the system senses slippage, it directs more power to the front.  &quot;4 High&quot; distributes the power fifty-fifty between the front and rear wheels.  You may switch between these modes on the fly or while sitting still.  I live in an area that can receive significant amounts of snow and I've never been stuck or felt like conditions were too bad that I couldn't leave home if I wanted. I have never switched to &quot;4 Low&quot;, but with the relatively low ground clearance, the Explorer is not made for serious off-roading.

6) THE BOTTOM LINE - I'm buying this truck at lease end.  The buyout cost is about $1,100 less than best price I can negotiate from a dealer.  When I tell the dealers my buyout cost they throw up their hands and say &quot;Buy it!&quot;  The plusses are many, the minuses are few. For a family like mine, with two small children, a minivan is probably the more logical choice.  But I'll pass on the mommy-mobile until we outgrow seating for five.<br><br>
