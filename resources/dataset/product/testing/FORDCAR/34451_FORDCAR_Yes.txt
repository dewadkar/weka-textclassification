            When i wrecked my car I we took it to the ford dealership to get an estimate on it then took it to a few other places and decided to go with Ford (the lowest) So after they were ready for us to bring the car in we took it and they said it would be two weeks. Well two weeks went by and We called and they said that they had got the wrong fender and are waiting on the right one to come in, ok no problem so then when they got the &quot;right one&quot; in they called on friday morning and said that it would be monday because yet again they got the wrong one in. So monday came and we called them and they had the right one and were putting it together just then, and it would be ready that afternoon well after they put it together they realized that they didn't put that headlight brace in. So it would be the next day. Well they put that on and then they told us that they were sending it to the paint shop. Ok so then they said they had the wrong headlight so it would be the next day, the next day they didn't get the right one and then the weekend went by. So monday came and My dad had to go down to the dealership and sit there and make them work on it right then and wouldn't leave without the car. so they finished it right then and we finaly after 3 and a half weeks got the car fixed. For anyone who has car troubles i would recommend making the dealership a last (i mean last) resort. I know I'm not going back there unless i absolutely have to <br><br>
