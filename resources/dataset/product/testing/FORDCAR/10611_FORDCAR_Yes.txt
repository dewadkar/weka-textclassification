            I just bought my 2000 Ford Ranger. Ford only made 250,000 of my model because It is the Ford Ranger Sport. A awesome truck. The sport has more suspension then a regular Ranger. I read the manual and it said that it is meant for a person that loves to camp. I also got the extended cab with the 2 extra seats in the back. The floors aren't rug they are rubber, they say the most durable material in any pickup truck. In the front of the truck there is a honey comb grill. It looks sharp! Too bad the truck only gets 16 miles to the gallon. I recommend this truck to all the guys out there who love Ford pickup trucks. I do not recommend this truck to any girl because there is a high step when you first get in. The torque is awesome in my opinion this truck is a great racing truck out in the wilderness. Even though it is not 4x4 it still tears up terrain. I bought this truck because it looks better then the F-150.
