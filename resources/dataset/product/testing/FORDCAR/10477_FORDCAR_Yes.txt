            The Ford Ranger is the absolute best light truck on the market today.  It looks stylish and it rides like a dream.  It can also keep up with the Chevy S-10's on the road.  I wouldn't trade mine for 5 Chevy's and I was Chevy through and through until I bought this my first Ford.  It has an automatic transmission that shifts very firmly.  It rides quietly, even when operated in four-wheel drive.  My Ranger has over 100,000 miles on it and it hasn't missed a beat.  So if I was in the market for a good mid-sized truck I would definitely get the Ranger.  It is also roomier than the true mini-pickups, like the S-10's and Nissans.<br><br>
