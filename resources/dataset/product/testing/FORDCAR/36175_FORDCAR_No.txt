            I never really drove a Ford until my car got smashed and i needed a rental. I rented the Focus SE (i had no choice). It has the 110Hp sohc engine which sounds pretty nice. Personally I dont like the styling both interior and exterior. It is too crazy for me. The exagerated wheel arches and the odd shaped tail lamps just dont do it for me. Something plain and simple such as a Corrolla or Protege is what I like. But if the car had other things to offer i may be able to live with it, but it doesnt. It is slow. I couldnt believe how slow the car was even though it was an automatic. When pinning the gas pedal the transmission seems to get confused. It takes a while for the gears to change, and its not as crisp as it should be. However, cabin noise is very minimal and the ride is smooth. When turning somewhat agressivly the tires chirp. Making a right turn at 40kmh is all you need to get them chirping. Oh yeah, visibility is poor too. Even more so at night. Fit and finish is poor in my opinion. Things seem to be loose and not properly assembled. The car i drove had 20000 kms on it and already the interior dome light was burnt out and the mirror adjuster was broken. The car doesnt feel solid at all. Maybe this car was just assembled poorly. Or is it the design? I sure hope they make them sturdier in Europe because the American built ones just feel like they are going to fall apart.<br><br>
