            Purchased this car in Sept of 02, with 128K on it.  One previous owner.  It is the base model w/ 5 speed.  No cruise or A/C.  From a sellers standpoint, does not hold it's value well.  (Paid 1800!)  Very roomy, the seats hold up nicely to the wear and tear of day-to-day use.  The 5-speed feels really nice and smooth.  I owned a 93 Escort for 7 years, and did not have any unscheduled problems with that car, so I am happy to be back in the Escort line.  25-28 City/35-38 Hwy, is great gas mileage these days.  Overall the car handles great and keeps on moving.  Even with 4 adults in the car, there is still room to spare.  The trunk holds all of my outdoor gear at once, golf clubs, fishing great, tent and sleeping bag, with room to spare.  

Problems, just the cup holders, which it sounds like I am not the only one.  They are not deep enough to handle tall drinks on curves.  

Overall, Great car, could not be happier.
