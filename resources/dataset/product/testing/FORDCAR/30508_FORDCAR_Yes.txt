            My F350 is a fine truck however having problems with Ford fixing two major problems.  Problems are as follows:
1. My truck is a early model.  The air intake is in the fender well and I have a problem a loud sucking or as I call it a loud howling noise from that area.  Ford's district mgr refuses to fix the problem.  Dealers in other areas have solved this problem by rerouting the air intake to the front grille like the later Ford models and this does fix the problem. 
2. When I start the Powerstroke after setting for awhile I get a loud thump noise from under the hood.  I continually complain about this but nothing seems to be done to fix it<br><br>
