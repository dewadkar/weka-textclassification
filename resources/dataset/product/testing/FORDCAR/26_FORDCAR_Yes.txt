                I bought a 1999 Ford Taurus LX. I really like that car a lot. It provides safety and reliability. This car has a lot of body force and power. When I drive this car it feels like I'm driving a nice strong heavy sports car.

    Some of the things I hate about this car is it's hard to park because of its size and length. Taurus is 197 inches long. This car is a gasoline hog, my car also jumps a little when I'm driving. My car has a nice smooth ride to it. Some of the things I like about this car is it's a large car, it has great acceleration, a big trunk, and it has special functions. This car has better functions than the Ford Crown Victoria Base Sedan. Some of the special functions I have in my car is automatic windows and locks, dual air bags, keyless remote control, overdrive, emergency trunk release, middle front seat flip fold with three cup holders, storage compartment, and a cell phone compartment. It also has a large glove compartment as well. The dashboard on this car is very large.

    I paid $24,000 for my 1999 Ford Taurus LX. Ford Taurus is a nice family sedan. My Taurus can fit a full size 6 passengers. If you can't afford a nice family sedan like the Ford Taurus then I would suggest you to get the lower car model which is the Ford Taurus's baby brother the Mercury Sable. They both are made from the ford motor company and share the almost the same strength and size. I would say the Ford Taurus is more stronger than the cheap Mercury Sable. Mercury Sable would cost around $15,000.
