            Want a valuable truck without the gas guzzling. Buy a ranger. This is my second ranger and I haven't even parted with my first.

My original 1994 ranger has over 150k miles and still runs like new. I just bought the 99 for a fresh start but I will keep the 94 for work purposes.

In both models gas mileage is excellent. Out of the 3 years I have owned the 94 I only had to pay for general maintenance. 

The only downfall is that it  lacks in power. it takes a little to get the speed up there but hey at least it helps from not getting any speeding tickets!

If your in the market for a light-duty inexpensive truck that will last a long time, I recommend highly checking out a ranger and talking to other people that own one.<br><br>
