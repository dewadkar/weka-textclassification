            I bought my 1991 Tempo after a year in a 1981 Plymouth Reliant-K car (a nice reliant automobile :).  The price was good and it has a fairly solid reputation (lets face it - if you could afford a Lexus you would buy one - but you can't.  So this is your option.  For the price range it is quite a good car).

I haven't had any major problems - replaced a few parts, did some fairly expensive front end work (CV joints, tire rods ends ... turns out it would have been cheaper to just replace the entire front axle - but hind sight is always 20/20).

What I love about this car is that with its lowly 12 gallon tank I can drive from Fargo to Minneapolis (240 miles) and then zip around the city for 2 days before hitting the 1/4 tank line.  GREAT fuel economy.  Another thing to love about them is how damned cheap they are to fix relative to other cars in this size (read: imports).  Also they are pretty easy for the do-it-yourselfer.  I have found doing many repairs, and all maintaince, to be very easy.  And if you need something like a seat (I replaced one a while back) they can be readily found at any car recycling yard for under 50 bucks [I paid 25]).  It also has a surprisingly large trunk.  I've driven it for 3 years in Fargo ND winters (including the infamous one in 1997 that flooded the entire Red River Valley region) and never been stuck in the snow, ice, etc - and yes ... I do drive on unplowed roads.  It also is very reliable starting with a block heater.

What I hate about the car?  It is a compact - but I knew that getting into the deal.  Its 4cyl engine (there is a 6cyl available) is kind of weak [98hp] but I have no trouble keeping it at 75 for long trips.  The sound system is not great - but its not bad either.  Kind of a moot point.

Who needs this car?  If you're reading this - then chances are you do.  There aren't many cars in this price range and size range that can still be found in good shape with relatively low miles.  The Tempo is available as an all whell drive (AWD) model as well - which I probably should have bought, but didn't.  If you're looking for a car that will get you through a few years - will be more or less reliable and is inexpensive to repair then this is the car.

Lets face it - if you think you're getting a Lexus for $2000 then you're deceiving yourself.  But if you know what you are getting into and don't hold delusions of grandour - this is a quality automobile from a quality company.  Avoid the late 80's models if you can - the early/mid 90's are pretty decent though.

I still drive mine even now that I can afford better (well - I did buy my wife a better car :)
