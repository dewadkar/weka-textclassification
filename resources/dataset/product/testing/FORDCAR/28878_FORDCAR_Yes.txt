            The New Explorer Sport Trac is a very versatile SUV. While it isn't quite on sale yet, when it is you'll notice it. This is a hybrid vehicle; a four-door SUV with a truck bed about four feet long. This vehicle shares its front-end styling with the new Explorer Sport, which will be on sale in the fall. The truck bed may be shorter than a truck, but it can be extended. By opening the gate, and pulling another gate forward, the bed is about a foot longer. This feature is also on the Nissan Frontier Crew Cab. The back window rolls down to let even more air into the spacious cabin. 

The interior can be equipped with four captains chairs, with two center consoles, and an optional six-disc in-dash CD player. From the inside, this Explorer is just like its counterparts, with no area inside behind the second seats. The bed comes with tie down hooks, to secure anything from cargo to a motorcycle. The roof can be equipped with a rack, to hold any number of items. 

The power on this hybrid may be a problem; it comes with the V6 engine on the regular Explorer. Ford may see the demand for a V8, and offer that in the coming months. 

Think of this car as a American-built Nissan Xterra, with a pickup bed instead of an interior storage area. The Ford is a little better it this area because carrying bikes and such outside will keep the inside cleaner.

Look at this when you go to buy a regular Explorer. <br><br>
