            I have a 1992 Ford Tempo, and I wish I didn't. This car is the definition of the word lemon. Everything that can go wrong with a car has gone wrong with this one. I have replaced two starters, the alternator, and all of the hoses. The electrical system has had to be rewired. The power windows only work on rare occaision. The power locks have never worked. The power steering has gone out, twice. The brakes are mushy. The gas mileage is frighteningly low. The service engine light went on the second week I had it, and no matter what I have repaired it never goes off.
You want more reasons to avoid this car? The jack that comes with it is useless. The windshield wipers stick. The turn signals have a habit of sticking, and not deactivating after you complete the turn. The odometer doesn't work. It leaks oil. It leaks transmission fluid. It makes funny noises. It dies constantly.

Is there anything good about this car? I like the color. It's a nice bright red.

In conclusion: I hate this car. The Ford Tempo should be avoided at all cost!<br><br>
