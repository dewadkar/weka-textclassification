            The Mustang carries over its 35th anniversary redesign for the current model year and is again available in four trim lines - Coupe, Convertible, GT and GT Convertible. All come standard with front and rear fascias, side scoops, grille, tri-bar taillamps and hood scoop. An interior decklid release and child seat tether anchor brackets are added safety features. New colors this year are Sunburst Gold, Performance Red and Amazon Green. The optional V-6 Sport Appearance Package includes rocker panel striping, leather wrapped steering wheel, rear spoiler and new 15 inch 6-spoke aluminum wheels or optional 16 inch 5-spoke wheels. Really, it's just an all around great car.<br><br>
