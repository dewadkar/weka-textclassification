            I bought my Ford Escort just under a year ago and I am very happy with it. I have put 80,000 kilometers on it since (long commute) and have had no problems with it. It of course has great gas mileage with it's 2.0L 4 cylinder engine and a 5 speed manual transmission. It also handles surprisingly well for what it is...a (small) family sedan. The independent suspension and 14" tires are mainly responsible for that. I do wish that I had the rear disc brake option for some more sporty driving.  For those drivers out there, a slight touch of understeer under heavy cornering is predictable...unless you get on the brakes! While I am on the brake subject there is one problem not only on this car but many new ones. The actual disc on disc brake cars do not last as long as older ones. They are built with less "meat" on them and subsequently are more prone to overheating and warping. I have already replaced my front discs. Anyhow, the interior of my Escort is typically Ford. Everything is plastic and it feels like it could break under my fingertips at the push of a button...but so does Chevrolet, Pontiac, Dodge etc etc. I would like to see a North American car company come out with a higher quality interior (Yeah right!).The sound system is not bad for average use. I have however, modified it so I won't go in to detail.

The engine has had absolutely no problems and continues to run smoothly. You should also note that I have been using 100% pure synthetic motor oil. For this makes an enormous difference in the life and operation of any gasoline engine regardless of size, age, type or other peoples opinion!  Sorry, just a little Syntec plug.
