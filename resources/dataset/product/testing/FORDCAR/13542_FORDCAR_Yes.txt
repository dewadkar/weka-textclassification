               I recently bought a 1999 Ford Explorer.  I decided to buy it because I wanted a SUV.  The Ford Explorer appealed to me because it is a fairly cheap SUV and is safe.  
   I love that the Ford Explorer is a safe car.  Its background tests show that it can be used for the family, which is my primary concern.  I also like how it makes me feel in control of the car and how it is fairly cheap.  The thing that I don't like about the car is how much gas it eats!  I have had a lot of cars and this by far eats the most gas!  So if you buy this car, be prepared to give up a lot of money to feed your car!
   This vehicle rides fairly smooth.  It is not the best car for smoothness, but overall all it is okay.  The car keeps road noises out very well.  The Ford Explorer also makes you feel in control of the car.
   A person with a family should drive this car who doesn't commute to the city for work.  Believe me, it is a pain to drive it into big cities as it is too big and hard to park.  Also, you should be prepared to spend big bucks on gas if you want the Ford Explorer!
