            I am very indifferent when it comes to the F150 series of Ford trucks, but Ford really improved the quality in the F350 series. Its really in a class of its own. There is no other truck that could match the massive structure of this truck. I am truly impressed. This truck is great for towing mass weight, or just plain driving over cars on the road. Seeing this truck come up behind you on the road, is like watching a mobile skyscraper. The durability and reliability, of this truck makes me believe that Chevy might not be the only good American truck. I recommend this truck to any buyers, especially construction related buyers, very useful.<br><br>
