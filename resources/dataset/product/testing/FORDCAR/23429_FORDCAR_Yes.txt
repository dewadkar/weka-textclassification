            I should first start out in stating that I own a 2000 Taurus SES. 
<p>
Ok, now also understand that I bought the car brand new, and I was 18yrs old. Now, you may ask yourself why an 18yr old would want a <i>Taurus</i>? Here's my answer: It's a downright value packed car. 
<p>
It doesn't do one thing spectacular, but it also does not does anything miserably. It looks nice, handles good, has good power, and will last a good while.
<p>
With that said I will give you the rundown of the Taurus I own.
<p>
200hp Duratec V6 (DOHC 3.0L)
4 speed AX4N Automatic Transmission
Black/black, cloth interior
Mach radio w/6 cd changer
Adjustable Pedals

<b>Exterior</b>
The newly redesigned for 2000 Taurus is arguably the best looking bodystyle for the Taurus since it's 1986 inception. It features nicely contoured doors and fenders, a sculpted front end, and a Jaguar-esque rear styling. The design is not ground-breaking, but it is still very handsome.

<b>Interior</b>
The two-tone interior is very pleasing to the eye, and has a nice airy feel to it. It boasts more interior space than most of it's competitors, and feels much wider inside. The seats are firm, but not so much to make you sore. Cloth material is of high quality and is very durable and soft to the touch. Gauges are easy to read, and simple to use. The radio buttons are oversized for ease of use, and the CD changer in the center console is much more convenient than other manufacturer's whom place it in the trunk or glovebox. However, I would have preferred the in-dash changer found in some other cars. 

<b>Ride & Drive</b>
The optional 200hp V6 found in the SES Taurus is a very capable and rewarding engine. It lacks the low rpm torque of the Nissan Altima 3.5, but it does hold it's own once it gets into the higher rpm ranges. Above 3500rpm the engine seems most happy, and will pull all the way to it's 6200 shift point happily. 
Ride is excellent in this Taurus, as it has been for the majority of it's 16yr life. It absorbs potholes with ease, and is not phased by normal road conditions. 
Handling is surprisingly well-weighted and for the most part very predictable. The problem is that it is very ride-biased. It seems the engineers may have overdamped the shocks a tad, which causes some moderate handling quirks. Brake dive is evident on hard stops, body roll is also evident in quick maneuvers. However, it is never so floaty that it is unbearable.

<b>Summary</b>
For the $20k I spent on this Taurus I received a fairly large list of accomodations. With some suspension fine-tuning, and transmission adjustments this Taurus would give the Camry/Accords some hefty competition.
