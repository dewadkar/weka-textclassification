            Ford has finally made a car that impresses me in every way.  Ford's Focus ZX3 is a work of art!  Style and fun are blended together with economy and sensability to create a beautiful car that is uniquely tasteful and destined to be the defining car of this generation.

The ZX3 is exceptionaly user friendly.  The cockpit area is laid out so that all of the controls are comfortably in reach.  The gear shift on the five speed is beautifully done, with a brushed steel look that has the feel of the Audi TT interior.  The ZX3 is classified in the compact catagory but has an amazing amount of interior room in both the front seat and the back.  My husband is 6 foot tall and could not reach the clutch pedal if the seat was all of the way back.  The sound system is more than adequate and the seating is very comfortable.

The ZX3 has a four cylinder engine that is really peppy.  I mean it is not a sports car by any means, but with the five speed you won't be the last off of the line at the red light either.  The clutch in the five speed is miraculously easy to use which along with the inexpensive sticker price makes this the perfect car for the first time driver or college student.

If you are a die hard Ford fan take a look at the ZX3, if you are not a Ford fan or are not familiar with them give the ZX3 a looksee, you will be impressed.<br><br>
