            In the market for a truck took me to my local Ford dealer.  I am a bit biased in that I do not buy anything but Ford products.  I was looking for a 1996 F-150 Super Cab.  Couldn't find one ANYWHERE.  But what I did find is a 1996 F-150 6 cyl. auto, long bed with 96,000 miles on it.  The truck had been well cared for and the engine was immaculate.  I bought the truck because I missed my 1994 F-150 so much and don't care for the newer body style.  Anyway, I did buy the extended warranty (just in case).

The truck has classic good looks and runs great. I have not had any major problems with it but a few minor ones.  But after 107,000 (now) you'd expect a few.  A few words of wisdom, if your transmission &quot;jerks&quot; when shifting from 1st to 2nd, it's an actuator spring in the transmission.  Don't let the dealer tell you it's not.  Been there, done that! On two different Ford trucks. Also, if you hear a rattle that seems to be coming from the passenger side rear wheel, it's the thin metal bracket that holds the leaf springs together.  On top of the leaf spring, under the bracket, is a piece of rubber.  Both of mine have worn out.  Don't go to the dealer for this.  Go to a auto parts store and buy a $1.99 brake pedal pad for a Honda.  Trim off the lip and secure it on top of the leaf spring and put the bracket back on.  Works great and it's cheap.

Other than those few minor things, it's a great truck.  It truly is build &quot;Ford Tough&quot;.<br><br>
