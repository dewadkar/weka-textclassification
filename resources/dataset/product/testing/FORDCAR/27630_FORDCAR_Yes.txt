            I went into my dealership to buy another outfit, but when I saw the Ford Escape, I just had to test drive it. After the drive, I came back and bought it. What can you say about a outfit, you can go to church in and also, take to get you to the mountains. All in one outfit. There is nothing about the outfit that I didn't like. Sorry, there was one thing. The Firestone tires had to go. Thanks to Ford for making my dream outfit.
The outside is just so, easy to keep clean. The gray around the bottom, helps so, you don't get rock chips on the paint. I think that is wonderful. This outfit is just easy to wash and keep up. I love the inside, it has a lot of room, more than my car did. It doesn't look like it would have more room but it does. The drive is just heavenly. My back doesn't hurt after a three hour drive to see my sons. I will be keeping this outfit, so a long time. It is everything that I have ever wanted and the price is just great.<br><br>
