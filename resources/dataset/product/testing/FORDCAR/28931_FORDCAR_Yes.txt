            The 93 I currently own is the third explorer I've had. The first was a '94 sport that I bought in 1995, this was a great vehicle that I had no problems with in the 3 years that I owned it. I think the only repair work done in that time was front and rear brakes. The second was a 1998 four wheel drive sport which I loved dearly, unfortunately a month to the day after I bought it, it was slammed into by a drunk driver and totaled which brings me to the '93 four door I currently own. I bought the '93 for
$12,000 just over a year ago. Since owning it I have replaced the muffler, front brakes, tires and starter motor, which I don't consider to be too bad as I now have a vehicle that I would drive anywhere with no hesitation. I have never had a break-down or any other major problems with any of the explorers I've owned. <br><br>
