In August of 1997, it was time to start looking for a new car.  With the exploding S.U.V. market, I began comparing the Chevrolet Blazer and the Ford Explorer.  It's true that the Blazer was less expensive, and I did prefer the styling of the Chevy a tad bit more.  But after comparing crash test results and owner satisfaction surveys in CONSUMER REPORTS, I opted for the Ford.  The model I chose is the 1997 XLT with CONTROL TRAC, 4.0L SOHC engine w/ 5 speed automatic transmission.  

I live in New York City, which means my version of off-road capability is the infrastructure of the NYC road system itself.  The ride is quite compliant, not being as stiff as the older models of Explorer's that I've driven.  The CONTROL TRAC feature simply means that all 4 wheels receive power all the time.  This is standard.  There is a switch on the dash that allows you to select 4WD HIGH or 4WD LOW for more vigorous off-road applications.  If you're a city dweller like me, you will probably never use this feature.  At any rate the CONTROL TRAC works extremely well.  Pulling away from a stop sign in snowy or wet conditions is simple:  Step on the gas and drive away.  NO SLIDING!  

The controls are well laid out, easy to get to, and quite simple to use.  One complaint about the interior:  I have power front seats, and I do wish the front seats moved back just a bit more.  I'm average in height (5'11&quot;) but could still use a bit more room, especially when driving on long trips.

The standard anti-lock brakes do a great job, though you have to be careful not to brake hard and turn sharply.  The Explorer, like many S.U.V.'s has a tall center of gravity and a narrower width, which makes the vehicle feel less surefooted in some manuvers.  A quick, jerky lane-change on the highway, or a sudden braking and turning motion (for instance:  avoiding a child that darts into the street) will raise your heart rate, since doing so makes the Exlorer feel as if it's leaning way over, with the possibility of flipping at any moment.  

On the plus side (and this is a BIG PLUS!) the raised height of the vehicle, the tremendous amount of windows, and the huge rearview mirrors make it so easy to view the road ahead, as well as the surrounding traffic.  I've found that by properly adjusting the rearview mirrors, there are almost no blind spots on this vehicle at all!  This gives me more time to react calmly and smoothly to the challenges of everyday driving.  

Cargo space is great!  To me that's pretty obvious.  

Mechanically, I've not had any problems with the vehicle.  My only real complaint is that the fuel economy is quite poor.  In town I average no more than 12 M.P.G.  My highway mileage is equally unimpressive:  19 to 20 M.P.G.  The gas tank is big, so the distance traveled between fillups is not an issue.  However, you will notice a substantial gas bill each month.  

Overall, I like many things about my Explorer.  I love the high vantage point, the traction afforded by the CONTROL TRAC system, the humongous cargo space and the general good ride.  Had I to do it over again, I probably would have.  The lack of fuel economy is irritating, and the different handling aspects must be kept in mind for safety's sake.  But all in all, I gotta love my S.U.V.!
