            I bought a '99 Ford ranger supercab,XLT, 4X4. I specifically wanted a small pickup truck with 4 wheel drive. I checked around for quite awhile, reading information on the internet, magazines etc. as to which model was best in it's class. The Ranger seemed to top them all and after test driving several of the competition I had to agree. I've owned this vehicle for slightly over a year now and it rides the same today as it did when I bought it. Very tight (no rattles) and somewhat smooth for a small pickup. There is a slight wind noise through the side windows but I either got used to it or its minimal. I have the 6 cylinder engine in this one which has decent power, but you still need to kick it down when passing.
The seats are very comfortable in front but like all small pickups the back &quot;side&quot; seats face each other and are made for children at best. I could fit five in here for a short ride but 3 of them better be children. If there are children in the back be careful starting and stopping abruptly because they may smack their heads on the back window (ask my kids they'll tell you:-) The supercab does make for a nice area to store items, when you don't want them in the bed of the truck. I use it more for that reason than any other.
Gas mileage is slightly lower than the competition, probably in the 14 to 18 mpg range.
The truck is very sound and has not been back to the dealer for any type of warranty work! The stock am/fm stereo cd player sounds great!
The four wheel drive option is fantastic and uses the standard Ford switch on the dashboard. Very simple!!!!!
Some recommendations if you're in the market for a small pickup:
First of all...Buy a Ranger!!
Get the supercab, but buy the model which allows the rear doors to open. This is a nice feature that I wish I had. It makes it much easier to get in and out and also to place bulky items back there.
If you can afford the costs get some of the option packages like remote mirrors etc...if you're used to having these in your other vehicles you'll definitely miss them (I know I do).
