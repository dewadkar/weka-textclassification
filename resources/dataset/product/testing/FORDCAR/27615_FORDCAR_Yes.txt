            I wanted a car, my wife wanted an suv. We drove an escape and we fell in love. For $23,500 we got an XLT 2wd(who really needs 4x4 anyway when you got fwd),leather, sun roof, 6cd changer, and running boards.We love the way it handles and the V-6 WILL spin the rims off the tires.We just got back from a 600 mile round trip and we love it even more.We got about 25mpg and cruised at 80mph all the way to our destination. It's nice having a unique ride that people stare and point at.It's amazing how many people don't know about this little truck.I'm sure ford will sell a bunch once the word gets out.Just a couple complaints. The dealer would not budge from the sticker price.This will change once thier lots fill up.Second, it could use a little more lighting in the interior. It's sometimes difficult to find the ignition key hole in the dark.<br><br>
