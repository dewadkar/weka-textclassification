            I own a 1997 Ford Taurus SE Sedan that I purchased used in 1998. On May 1st, 1999, my birthday, by the way, I decided around midnight to hop in my car and drive to the local quick mart to get a soda....yes a soda, I was not intoxicated.  On the way home, I pulled into the turning lane to turn onto my street, when suddenly BAM!!! I hit another car head on going apx 20 mph. The other vehicle was a luxury van, going apx 35 mph, that I totaled out..sorry guy if your reading this.  I got out of the car, shaken a bit with a few scratches and bruised chest, but, I WAS ALIVE!!! The repair company told me that the air conditioner had to be replaced because of the impact. Every window was shattered, both airbags deployed, but, the car didn't look really that bad. The insurance company decided not to total my taurus out and fixed it. At that time my car was valued at about $8000 before accident. The total cost to fix was $9345. It didn't make sense..but, I accepted, and the now car looks and drives like it has never been wrecked before. 
The minor problems consist of replacing antenna that was ripped out by the car wash, rattling door after wreck, stereo can not be changed out easily, trunk leaks a bit..possibly because of missing antenna. Also, I can't seem to sell it and my trade in value is zilch because of the great number of them out there.
Bonuses include lots of leg room...the kids aren't driving you crazy by kicking your seat, huge trunk..love that! My poor taurus has to suffer the abuse of 3000 miles a month while I commute to and from college. The long drives are pretty comfy for someone of my size (petite)
The Ford Taurus, unless it's a SHO, doesn't do anything for the single chicks out there. It's flat out UGLY. But, it is safe and I can't complain. I could still be driving that Pea Green 1973 Buick LeSabre that I paid $100 for when I was down and out. Now that car is definitly not for the single chicks!!!
Overall, The Ford Taurus is a pretty decent car that has proved itself to me time and time again. It's a safe car for all you moms out there..but remember singles...this car is not for you!!
