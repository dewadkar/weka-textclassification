            My 1994 Ford F-250 SuperCab 4X2 HD pick-up is  quite a tough truck. I have the beast of all engines, the 460! I only get &quot;9&quot; miles to the gallon, but hey, if you want to keep up with the big boys you've gotta pay!

What I really love about my F-250 is the convenience of repairs. You can find an auto shop or parts just about anywhere, even though I've had zero trips to shop myself. I bought it a year ago, used. It has an incredibly smooth ride and handling package. The seats although they are conversion seats are wide, comfortable and cushey. This truck can also haul a 3 horse trailer loaded without a problem and lots of torque! 

The only drawback for me is the warm-up time on cold mornings. It takes forever to warm up and defrost. I'm always late because of it! Also, our truck has a 5-speed standard transmission and first gear is hardly ever used. It is really low geared. We live in some rough country so it comes in handy though.
