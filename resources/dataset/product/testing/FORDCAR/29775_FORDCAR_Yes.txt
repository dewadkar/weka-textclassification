            I bought an SUV because we live in a rural area where snow can be a problem. Also my wife is disabled and I needed a veh. big enough to 
hold her electric scooter in the rear. The Explorer was the only US 
SUV wide enough to hold the scooter cross wise in the back without putting the rear seats down.. We bought a '97 Eddie Bauer new.Financing thru Ford was easy,but int. not the best.The veh. was beautiful.Has many bells and whistles. After 2 1/2 years and 34,000 miles I am not happy with it. The ride stinks. It is nickle and dimeing me to distraction.Of the many new cars I have purchased I have never had one that had to back to the dealer as often as this one. 3 recalls and countless adjustments and repairs. Nothing really big yet but it seems to be endless.Emergency brake handle broke, brake rotors warped and had to be cut twice in 25,000 miles, 3 different &quot;check engine &quot;light problems, RR dr lock quit working, low gas mileage, rough idle, and two problems with the auto climate control. The dealer is terrific about fixing things but they shouldn't go wrong to begin with in the first 30,000 miles. This is NOT a good highway veh.At speeds over 60 in is not very stable.At 70 mph isn't downright hairy.On the plus side it does accomodate the electric scooter ( Rascal) crosswise in the back. Ford paid the price of having the winch re-installed from my old car which lifts the scooter up into the back. The 4x4 works well. The V-6 has more than enough power, but the gas mileage isn't so hot, about 16 mpg. Right now I don't think I would buy another Ford when I replace this veh.I had hoped when I bought it that it would last 5-6 year but now think I will replace it as soon as it is paid for next year.   <br><br>
