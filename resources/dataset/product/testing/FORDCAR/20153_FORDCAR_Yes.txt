              We purchased our 2000 Windstar about one year ago and have not regreted it one bit.  We had been driving a 97 Chevy Astro and got tired of the box like design and the auwkward handling especially in the winter.  This purchase defintally was a step in the right direction.

  I feel in love with the ride right off the bat, it was like riding on a cloud.  It handles the curves wonderfully and the engine sure has plenty of get up and go.  We are stationed in Germany now and let me tell you, get up and go is a must.  The total ride makes a long trip not seem so long.  The leg room is also a plus for our family.  I have 4 children and 3 of them are boys.  My 12 year old is already 5 foot so you can understand why leg room is a must.  

  The Stylish look is another feature that attracked us to the Windstar.  It is areo-dynamic and that helps with gas milage, there is not as much wind resistance as with other vans.  We get 17 - 20 miles a gallon which is a very good thing with the price of gas these days. 

  I also like the seat belt light that is very clearly seen and even gets my fathers attention and has him even buckling up just to get the light off.  I am glad he buckles up for whatever reason, Good Job Ford!!

  The removal of the back two seats are pretty easy even for me, but the back seat is very heavy and is not an easy  job for person.  We have 2 bench seats in our van which is what we needed.  The van seats 8 adult confortably.

  The tempature controls are a very big plus in this van.  You can have one temp in the front and there is two controlls in the back so each row of seats can be comfortable.    The 4 doors is a  wonderfull feature.  You have easy access from either side and that is so nice.  I just wished I had this feature when my kids were babies.  I hated having to put the baby near the only door in the back  because I was always afraid the children  would bend the babies legs trying to get out.

  Power mirrors is another feature that I really like.  There is nothing more agervating then needing to adjust the passangers side mirror and being the only one in the car.  You have to pull over, if this is even an option, and break your back trying to adjust it.  I know as a mother I do not need any other distractions, the kids are sometimes more then enough!LOL

  The other features that I really am thankfull for is the  Secure Anti-theft sytem, Interior lighting and Dual Airbags.

  I am very happy with my van, and after having a great experience with the Ford Windstar, I will defintally purchase a Ford again.
