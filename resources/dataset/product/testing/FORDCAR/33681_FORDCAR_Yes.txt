                  I have a 1998 ZX2 sport and absolutely love it!! It's quick, it handles amazingly well and gets good gas mileage. I'm at 35,000 miles without a single problem, and am very pleased with my purchase. The interior  of the car is comfortable, even for my 6'4'' boyfriend.  All of the controls are well placed, in fact, everything on the ZX2 seems to have been well thought out and planned with the driverï¿½s comfort in mind.  The only thing I'd change would be the size of the glove box (way too small). I'd recommend the ZX2 to anyone who wants an affordable and sporty car, that is immensely fun to drive. <br><br>
