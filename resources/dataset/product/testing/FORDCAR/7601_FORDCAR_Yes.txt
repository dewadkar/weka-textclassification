            I have a 98 Eddie Bauer edition with the Triton engine.  I love it even now after 42000 miles.  In the first year I had nearly 26000 miles.  I took it in the snow, mud, heavy rains (flood) in the fields, off road, on the highway on the pacific coast and canyons of california.  You Name it I did it.  The car performed and (knock on wood) has not given me any huge problems.  

The ride is amazing I had prior an Explorer 1994 limited edition &amp; the expedition is better riding.  The length was not hard getting use to as I came from a 4x4 ride &amp; experience.  I must say that the extra room is fantastic.  I have had 8 adults in the car and we were all comfortable.  The extra toys air conditioner, load leveling and sound system helped.

The gas economy is typical of a truck this size I get 15 on the highway (speed above the limit) and over all 13-14 in the city.  Any one who wants gas economy needs to go some where else.  This vehicle makes even the die hard Chevy people green with envy.  I have friends and family who love to pick on it but are 1st to ask to take this car to football games and events.

I had the Explorer til I reached 94000 miles then sold it to my brother who loved it so much he has already asked if I will sell the Expedition to him when I hit 1k.  

The car is fantastic in all kinds of weather, it can go to any event and stand up against all in its class.

To say I am selective is to note I also own a 98 Lexus Gs300 and I still drive my Expedition 1st.

Get yourself one &amp; enjoy the ride<br><br>
