            When we were shopping for a new car back in 1995, we looked at every
type. We decided on a SUV for a family car. We looked at all the ones
on the market and drove all the ones we could. We checked the books and
Consumer Guides and they said that the Ford was the Number one  that
was out at the time. We tried the ones locally and on vacation and found
one that we liked. It was just what we wanted. I had a five speed transmission and the only thing it did not have was leather seats, but
we bought it anyway and we have had it since 1995 and we love it.
It is roomy enough and yet it is easy to park and drive. We also got the
4 wheel drive and plan to take it to the mountains and maybe even the
snow. We live in the South and we travel every summer on a car vacation
and it is really comfortable to be on the road.
There are some negative reports on them in the press however, we don't
have any negative things to say about it. 
The vehicle is perfect for families and I even carried furniture in the
back with the back seat down. It is like a small truck. The only thing
that I do not like about it is when you have to carry a gas can or 
something like that you must leave the windows down as the smell is
too strong. Not like a trunk in a car.<br><br>
