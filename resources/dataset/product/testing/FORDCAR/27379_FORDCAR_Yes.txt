            I wanted a vehicle that was heavy duty, could fit up to 5 people comfortably, and haul things if I needed, and this was the only vehicle that fit the bill.  SUV's are the rage, but have the drawback of not being able to haul large items ...this truck can do everything an SUV can, and you can load up a washer and dryer in the back if you need to.  Gas mileage is a little tough, but is comparable with the mileage on most SUV's.  The ride is even better than our Toyota Camry.  I opted for the Lariat package, as it is really not that much more for what you get (chrome wheels, leather, pin striping)  The vehicle is a little pricey, but you can tell by riding in the truck that it is well built and will last a long time.  I did my homework and was patient and ended up buying mine for $1,000 over invoice.
