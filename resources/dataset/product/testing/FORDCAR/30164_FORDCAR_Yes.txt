            The Ford Festiva, what's not to like about it.  My mom has had two different 1991 Festiva's and they are awesome.  They get about 45 to 48 miles per gallon, and it only takes about $9.00 to fill it up.  We have been to Myrtle Beach, which is a ten hour ride from WV, 5 times.  We can get within an hour of the beach before we have to fill up again.  I think this car would be great for students because of the mileage, cost, and it could fit at least five people in the car.  We rarely have to take it to the shop, maybe just to get the oil changed but nothing major.  I like the hatchback too.  It allows for easy access to anything in the &quot;trunk&quot;.  I highly recommend this car to anyone who wants to save money, because it definitely does. <br><br>
