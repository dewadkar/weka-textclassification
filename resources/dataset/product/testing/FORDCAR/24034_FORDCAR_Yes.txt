            I love my Expedition.  I bought a 1997 model in 1996 right when they first came out.  I was driving a Toyota 4-Runner that had just gotten too small for my family.  We went out on a Saturday afternoon to drive one.  It took exactly 2 minutes of driving down the road for me to fall in love with it.  The steering is outstanding.  At first when you drive one, you can over compensate when driving down the road, drive carefully.  After a few days you become used to it.  It can turn into very tight places, considering it's size.  It rides smoothly and comfortably with plenty of room for people who like this feature.  We have a 4 wheel drive model XLT, unless you do a lot of off-roading, don't bother with 4-wheel features.  The one thing I hated about the &quot;Ex&quot; was Fords lack of thinking concerning a CD player.  You had to pay extra for a CD player which I thought should definitely be included considering how much money we were paying.  They had zero cup holders in the 2nd set of seats if someone happened to be sitting in the middle.  They did not have magazine holders behind the front seats for the people in back.  I heard that Eddie Bauer models had this feature, but it should be included in XLT, it's an easy and inexpensive convenience.  The back controls for the radio are pretty much useless, we have never used them.  If it were a separate radio unit with head jacks, it would be better.  We were required to pay extra for running boards too, which I thought was cheap because after all, this was almost 7' tall, running boards should have been a factory addition, not an extra.  People who do a lot of family activities, or like to take people with them, it's a wonderful vehicle.  We have used ours for everything imaginable, camping, hunting, off-roading, going out on the town in Dallas/Fort Worth, it's really a great vehicle.  If you don't like big vehicles, then don't buy one, you'll only be miserable.  But it is amazingly easy to handle, steer, turn, park into tight places.  The gas mileage is so-so at about 14 city, 17 road, but that's pretty standard for it's size.  All in all, I give it an A+!<br><br>
