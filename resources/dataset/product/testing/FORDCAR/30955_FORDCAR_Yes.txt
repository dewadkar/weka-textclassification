            If you love finagling a loaner from your mechanic . . . if browsing the aisles of car repair stores turns you on . . . if trying to identify new rattles and noises from your car is your idea of intellectual stimulation, then the Ford Contour is the car for you.

I bought this car three years ago for my wife.  It was two years old at the time and ran fine for about six months.  Then the problems began.

First, some of the interior amenities belong in a Barbie plastic car.  The two cup holders are not embedded into the dashboard like one would expect, but are retractable spring-loaded push-button jobbers that look like something out of a sci-fi flick.  My son stepped on one and snapped it off; my wife snagged the second one with her purse strap.  Tadah!  No more cup holders.  

The seat belt buckle's plastic housing broke off into two pieces,and on hot days the rear-view mirror droops like a daisy.  But those were minor points compared to what was in store for us.

After two years of ownership, the car started hesitating and dropping out of gear.  I took it to my mechanic, who quickly diagnosed it as the transmission was going out.  The transmission?!  Seriously, when you buy a two-year old car, do you honestly start planning to replace a transmission in two years?  How many four year old cars drop their transmissions?

My mechanic didn't work on transmissions, but he gave us the number of a guy who did nothing but.  I called him and he told me that he will work on any transmission on any model car . . . except the Ford Contour.  Wouldn't say why, just didn't like them.

I was resorted to towing it to my friendly local Ford dealership Service Center ($$$).  They were happy to repair my car, of course.  The short story?  It took them a MONTH to find a refurbished (not new) transmission, and they charged me $2500 to do it.  Naturally, the warranty was expired, but at least they gave us a loaner.  I had to borrow money to pay for the car repair, and I still haven't paid the car itself off, so I make two payments every month for a worn-out car.  

Color me disgusted with the Ford Contour.<br><br>
