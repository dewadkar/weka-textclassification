            I have owned three VW's in my life but have always wanted a truck. Now being married and having a two-year old with another baby on the way, the practicality of a truck diminished. My wife protested me selling my VW and getting a truck. So after hours of research and talking with two mechanics, who are friends of ours, we decided to get a Bronco. 

We found a nice '96 XLT that had been meticulously maintained and bought it. Yes the price listed is correct, we got a GREAT deal. I am in heaven and my two-year old can't get enough of riding in the back seat and being able to see the road ahead. My wife now loves it so much that she prefers taking it on trips, as opposed to her 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The 5.8 liter V8 has great power and is not noisy. My wife comments how quiet the vehicle idles every time we come to a stop.

Some of the problems that people mention about these vehicles are true. Gas Mileage is mediocre but can be improved. Installation of an improved air intake system (I installed a K&N FIPK) and a good air filter (AMSOIL or K&N) will get you a couple of miles to the gallon and improved power. In addition, I have a new Borla exhaust system which has added another mile per gallon and more power. The price you will pay for these parts is about $500 in total but it is worth it. If you can install them it will save you the labor costs, installation is not hard for those who even only slightly mechanically inclined, like myself. They will probably never need to be replaced; the filters only need to be cleaned and retreated every 30,000 to 50,000 miles for the life of the part(my little one could do that if I let her use the oil treatment) and the Borla Exhaust will run about $375 but it is aircraft grade stainless steel guaranteed for 1 million miles (no kidding).

Entry into the back seat is tight for adults but it is a two-door. Also, the set up of the the back door is a pain. You have to put the rear, power window all the way down so that you can reach in and release the handle to drop the tailgate down. This is not convenient for loading or unloading groceries, dogs, boxes, etc.
