            You read right, I won my 1999 Ford Mustang Convertible on the Price is Right!  It has definatly been a dream come true.  While everything about my Mustang isn't perfect, I still love car.  Talk about a teenager's dream.  I now drive home along the beaches of Malibu with the top down.
  
   There are a few small design flaws that I wish Ford would have looked at.  First of all the placement of the little things.  The cup holder is right behind the stick shift and thus I can't drive with a drink in the holder.  The cd player is also right behind the stick shift.  I can put cd's in while I am driving, however it is difficult to pay attention to the road and the cd at the same time.
  The seat controls are under the seat.  Now it is great having electronic seat controls, I think they would have been much easier to use had Ford put them on the side of the seat.

  I did have one problem with the passenger window not closing all the way under the convertable top, but when I took the car into the Ford dealership, they were quick to fix the problem and since then I have never had to worry about it.

  Yet, how can I complain.  The car runs great.  I get about 250-300 miles for every 16 gallon tank.  I upgraded to the Mach 460 speakers and they are great.  The sound is loud even with the windows and the top down, flying at 100mph.  The convertable top flies open and closed.  I can basically open the top at the same speed that I can open the windows. The back seat is a little cramped for college kids, but when the top is down, no one complains.     
 
 This car is great for any young person who loves the attention of driving a true American classic.<br><br>
