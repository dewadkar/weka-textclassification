            Our 2002 XL Ford F-150 supercab pickup truck is a very pretty white color and it came with an automatic transmission and has an 4.2 liter 6 cyl.engine which is fuel injected with overdrive. 

This truck has a full size bed with a bedliner and a matching camper. This truck offers comfort and convenience than a traditional pickup, by this truck having the supercab it is bigger and can transport more people than a regular truck. 

This certain 2002 Ford F-150 supercab pickup truck is idea for a family because of the full size seats in front and in the back. Which was why we chose this truck, it is very roomy. Adult size people can easily sit comfortable in either the front or back seat.

The truck has a bench seat in front can fit 3 people and it has what I call a split bench seat in the back which also can fit 3 adult size people. The reason I call the back seat a split seat is because the way the seat is made, the seat can be pulled up at one section for extra storage room.

The controls for the wipers, and blinkers are located on the gear shift which located on the left side of the steering wheel. The overdrive button is located at the end of the gear shift which can be turned on with a simple push. The truck came with air, an am/fm stereo with a cassette player. The stereo system is very clear sounding.

The side rear doors can only be opened if either one of the doors to the 2002 Ford F-150 supercab pickup truck is opened first. These side doors are about half the size of the regular doors and can be opened by simply pulling on the handle that is located just inside the door.

Also the back window in this truck can be opened by unlatching the latch and pulling it opened. The glass on the camper which is right next to the back glass on the truck can also be opened by sliding it opened. So, there is east access to the camper part.

When we first test drove this 2002 Ford F-150 supercab pickup truck we were surprised at how easy the truck handled and the power that it has. The automatic was smooth shifting as we gained speed. The ride was very smooth and we didn't feel like we were riding in a truck at all. 

This truck came with a standard 4 wheel disc brakes, with 4 wheel ABS. The truck also came with dual airbags, If a child is riding in the front the airbag can be turned off by inserting the key into a slot and turning it off, then the airbag can be turned back on by the inserting the key again.

The interior of this truck is very nice, the seats are a gray fabric and are very comfortable, the seats had adjustments so that they can be adjusted to fit the drivers needs. The dash board is all black. There is a holder that can fit 2 cups that slides out located just down from the stereo for easy reach. 

The exterior of this truck is very stylish. It has a rounded body and flush mounted headlights, a locking rear tail gate, and the camper can be locked by simply turning the knob. The grille is chromed, and the wheels are very attractive.

As for as the gas mileage goes on our 2002 Ford F-150 supercab pickup truck well, with the gas prices going up once again and taking into consideration that we have only filled up the tank once since purchasing our truck I really can't comment on that right now but I know that with this big truck it will coat us a tad more than a car for gas.

We purchased our 2002 Ford F-150 supercab pickup from Dave Sinclair Ford in St. Louis, Mo. We bought it used and it had 26,000.00 miles on it for purchased it for the price of $16,400.00. This truck came with a 3 year or 30,000 mile warranty and of course the 30 day or 3,000 mile if anything goes wrong warranty. 

Dave Sinclair Ford made our purchase very easy, the salesman and the finance person did make things go smoothly for us and were both very nice and made sure we understood our truck and how the finance was being handled.
