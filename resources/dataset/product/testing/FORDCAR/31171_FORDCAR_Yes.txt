                        I bought our mustang in 1998.  I got the 4.6 GT model.  What  I liked about this car was the power and speed it had.  This car could do  135 with a quarter of a pedal left.  the bad thing about it was the size.  It is difficult for anyone over 6 feet to get in to the car. Once you are in the car it has enough room in the driver and passenger sides.  The back seat, or should I say the non existent back seat, was very small and I encorage anyone over the age of 5 not to sit back there.  The Mustang has lots of good things like I said it is fast, it handles extremely well, it rides nice and gets good gas mileage.  We never had a problem mechanic wise, with it the biggest strike aganist it is that the Goodyear Z rated tires were great for handling, but horrible for the snow and ice.  We got rid of the 'stang because we needed something that was all year round so we got a new F-250 Superduty with the 7.3L diesel.
