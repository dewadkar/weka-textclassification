            I just bought an adorable 1996 Ford Escort and I love it!
I've had a Ford Escort in the past, so I know that even though people like to make fun of Ford's little generic car, these little babies are dependable and affordable. 

<b>Looking Good</b>
 
Ok, so I'm not driving a Mercedes, but I actually feel proud when I sit in the drivers seat, because my Escort does look good. Mine is black, and it has the original paint job which is still shining beautifully with barely any scrathes or dents.  (Whoever had this car before me, must have adored it as much as I do!) The inside is really nice too - roomy and practical.  The front bucket seats still slide perfectly for adjusting for comfort, and the pretty grey material is not torn or worn even after almost 6 years of use.  All of the knobs and handles are original and working perfectly.  (Not like the peice of crap Geo Metro I once owned, where all of the plastic peices like doorhandles, air vent ducts, radio buttons, etc, were falling off after the first month.)  This car also came with nice silver rims, not cheap pop-off hubcabs. Plus, the air conditioning works great, so not only does the car look good, but the driver and passengers stay looking good even in the hot Florida sun!



<b>Spacious and Practical</b>

The back seat is roomy enough for 3 people to sit comfortable and there are seatbelts for each.  What I really like is that this vehicle is a hatchback, so you can lay the back seat down and double your packing room from the trunk space.  I recently did this while moving into my apartment, and was amazed to find out that my entertainment center fit right into it. I felt like I had a little pickup truck! It was great!  The trunk space even with the back seat up offers a lot of "luggage" room.  There is a tire space for the donut underneath all of that space, too.  And again to please the eye, Ford including a lovely "shade" or covering that attaches to the hatchdoor to "hide" your valuables from probing eyes. It's nice that you can take it off easily as I did while I was moving. Even the glove compartment is roomy! Not only am I storing the typical paperwork there, but my portable cd player also.

<b>Safety</b>

I will admit that while I was shopping I had been considering a vehicle a bit bigger than this. Not so much for interior space, because my Escort gives me plenty of that, but for safety because there are so many huge SUVs out there and I have a 5-year-old, and I don't like being the little one on the road.  But I DO feel safe in this car and I'll tell you why.  First of all, this is the first car I've ever owned with airbags.  Dual, at that.  Secondly, all of the seatbelts are in tiptop shape, and the front belts are automatic, which makes it nice because then I don't forget to buckle up. The brakes work great and the pick up even for an automatic is trustworthy.  All of my exterior lights function properly, as well as the speedometer, and warning lights. (The factory radio is still working like a dream and is located right by the lighter, all very easy to access while I'm driving.)  
I also like the fact that it has childproof locks, so when I buckle my son into the back seat, he can not open the door from the inside. He must wait for me to open it from the outside to let him out. This gives me more piece of mind while I'm driving in the front. And finally, the rear window is nice and large, so when I'm viewing things in my rearview mirror, I have a very clear view with hardly any blindspots.

<b>Ok, yeah, but how does it run?</b>

It runs great! I have an automatic transmission and it shifts into each gear smoothly.  For being a used car it still purrs, and when I'm waiting on a red light there is no rough idling.  

Under the hood, the engine still shines, and everything I need to check is easily accessible, from the oil dipstick to the transmission fluid dipstick.
 
One more thing, I'm getting about 30 city miles to the gallon, which is making me extremely happy, because I can fill my tank for $10 and drive all week.

Well, there you have it. I love my Ford Escort, and it saddens me to think that Ford won't be putting out these wonderful cars anymore. But then again, who knows? Maybe my little Escort will turn out to be a classic. He he. It's possible.

I do recommend this vehicle, as I'm very satisfied with mine. It is a cute, reliable, practical, and affordable vehicle.
