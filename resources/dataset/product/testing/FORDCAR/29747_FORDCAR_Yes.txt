            We purchased our 1997 Ford Explorer just before our first child was born. I had had a 1986 Ford Mustang convertible until that point and knew it wouldn't be practical to drive around with a new baby with the top down!The Explorer has not given us any trouble since we bought it and has done extensive traveling. We now have over 77,000 miles on it and have yet to have a problem. The size is perfect for carrying a small child and all of the 'essential&quot; items that are needed when traveling with our now almost 3 year old.  It feels safe to be riding higher than cars and I doubt I would choose to purchase a car in the future because cars now seem so small compared to the Explorer. It's a heavy vehicle, safe, yet handles easily. I would highly recommend the Ford Explorer- especially for new parents.<br><br>
