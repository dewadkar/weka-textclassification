            The Ford Expedition XLT 4WD has joined our family about a week ago and I love it.  This SUV has great features especially for women. They include adjustable power seats and foot pedals, outside digital temp, digital compass, second row access to radio including headphone jacks, automatic diming on rear windows. This truck is equiped with running boards and grasp handles on all four doors for easy loading yourself and passengers. The running boards assist  with small children for easy climbing in and out with out lifting your children. 
My truck has a powerful V8 engine and 4WD for outdoor fun no matter where you travel.
I have four children and there is plenty of elbow room without them stepping on each others toes and without complaints.
This SUV as a family car beats any minivan any day.
I suggest this Ford Expedition for any family who has several children and a husband who loves trucks. This SUV satisfies the entire family.
