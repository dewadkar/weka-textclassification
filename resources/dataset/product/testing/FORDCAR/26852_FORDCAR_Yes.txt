                My wife and I were looking for a 7 or more passenger car or truck when we looked at the Ford Expedition. I am 6'2 and my wife is 5'1 so finding something that suits us both was not easy. This truck seats 8 and has the room we need for shopping. It was not a hard choice this was the vehicle we needed. I have had many bad salesmen shopping for cars but this time was different the ford salesman was very polite and did not do the high pressure sales pitch, he let us take our time and shop around.                There is so much to love about this truck its hard to to pin down just a few but here goes. First to fully enjoy it you must get the Eddie Bauer package, its a few dollars more but well worth it. All leather seating,the soft fluffy kind. The driver seat has heating for rear end &quot;leather is cold in the winter&quot;. Speaking of winter the all wheel drive is great for this midwest weather. It has moving pedals with the touch of a button they raise or lower this is very useful for my wife as she would have had to sit closer to the steering wheel to reach the gas and brake with air bags and her size,not good. I have recently had a chance to tow with it, I have a two place snowmobile trailer and you cant even tell that is back there by the way it handles. If I had to say theres one thing I dislike it would be the automatic head lights, I feel the need to shut them off my wife says its a control thing. By the way she just loves them.<br><br>
