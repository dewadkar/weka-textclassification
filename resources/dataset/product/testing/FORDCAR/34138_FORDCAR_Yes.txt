            I bought an '86 crown victoria for less than one thousand dollars and it never ceases to amaze me.  It's got a V8, a 5 liter engine, and over one hundred and fifty horse power.  This car might be old but it can definitely kick some but. It has a great pick up.

I have ran into a couple of problems with this car including: windows not working, alternator not working, A/C not cold enough, and some little minor problems.  But the car is 14 years old and it is bound to have some problems.  I have had the car for about 2 years now and I have only brought it into the shop twice.  Most of the problems that occur with this car are minor things that can be fixed without taking it to the shop.  I love this car.  It is a tank.  I don't have to worry about dying in a car wreck in this car.  You could probably run into a brick wall at 50 miles per hour and still walk away.  It isn't hard at all to park, and it has a great suspension system.  The speakers weren't too good though so I got them replaced, ad I put in a CD player.  Other than that everything about my 'Vic is cool.  

I love this car.  I am going to keep it until I die or until it quits on me.  I don't know which will come first.

It has tons of space also.  Good for long distances.<br><br>
