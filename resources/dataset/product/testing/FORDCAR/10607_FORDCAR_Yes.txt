            The Ford Ranger is a comfortable pickup truck that best fits the ideal use of a teenager, a driver that is just beginning, or a college student.  The reason that I bought this pickup is because of the reasonable price that is offered with it.  These days pricings on cars are becoming outrageous.  The Ranger comes with an affordable price that is usually around 10 or 11 thousand dollars, brand new.  Now that may not include all of the luxuries that come along with the much finer trucks today, but it is the most reasonable price that you will come by.  I love my Ford Ranger because I have had it since 1995, and it has not lost it's value, and still runs like the day I bought it!  When driving this truck I feel very stylish, not as if I were driving something that I would be embarrased in.  The people that would appreciate this pickup the most would more than likely those who are first time drivers, or the college kids that are away from home.  Because of its' dependability and its' stylish look it would definitely be the best buy on the market for a pickup truck today!
