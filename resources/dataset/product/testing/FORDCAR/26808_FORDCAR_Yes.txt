            Having a family of three, I can't tell you how this car comes in handy.  When we carpool to soccer games, we have the whole soccer team fitted comfortably in the car.  Now, let me tell you about the features and why it is a good car.  First of all, the room in that car is just amazing.  If you like music, you got to get this car.  Second, if you ever get into a crash with another car, you will be totally safe. The quality of the leather they use is great too.  This is the only car I have fallen in love with ever in my life.  It is a MUST on my list.  Thank you for reading this. <br><br>
