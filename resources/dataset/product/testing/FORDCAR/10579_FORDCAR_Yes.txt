            I recently purchased a 1992 Ford Ranger pickup.  It has a base 2.3L four cylinder engine, four speed plus overdrive transmission, and is two wheel drive.  I like the feeling of sitting a little higher than some other traffic, which is much different than my previous car, a Nissan Pulsar NX.  The truck is a little bit on the slow side, but drives smooth.  It currently has 135,000 miles, but still runs like new.  I have installed an after-market stereo, but still has the stock speakers.  It sounds pretty good, but could use a little more bass.  One problem I've had with the transmission is that the rear seal leaks transmission fluid.  One surprise I found is the transmission, although manual, used automatic fluid. I think anyone who likes small trucks should buy this truck, but if you're looking for much towing power I suggest you go for the optional 4.0L V6. <br><br>
