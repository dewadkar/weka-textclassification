            my boyfriend got a '99 ford explorer sport last year and since then things have managed to keep going wrong with it.  they had to recall it because the power steering could have possibly caused the car to not be able to stop, the rear windshield wiper broke the third week, and the front passenger window wouldn't go down.  the car looks great and drives well (as well as an suv can, i guess), but the small problems decrease its appeal.  it doesn't get the best gas mileage, but it is very spacious and very quiet on the road.  it handles very much like a truck but is comfy and has great speakers and sound.  it would be a good car for people active in the outdoors; it has racks on top and is roomy enough to transport equipment.  families as well would enjoy this car.<br><br>
