            This should be Fords new catch phrase! The problem with that is it wouldn't help them sell their crappy cars. I own a 1988 Taurus Station Wagon. I had always sworn I would never by a Ford. Then, my Mother bought her Taurus Wagon and was so happy with it that, when I had the chance to buy mine, I went for it. I should have test driven the car and done some research first.   ....................................................................It has a V6 engine but, you can't tell. It feels more like a V2 engine which, I know, doesn't exist. It has no pick up and I often have people behind me rather aggrivated by my inability to get out of their way or my own for that matter. Being a used car, I figured the fuel injection was just gummed up. So I bought some fuel cleaner. This did not help at all. Then, I asked a mechanic about the problem and he said that these cars have a tendency to get tired. Tired? Have you ever heard of a car getting tired?   ....................................................................Then, there's the transmission problem. Sometimes, when I put the car into drive it will kick into gear really hard and the car lurches forward. I also have the same problem with reverse sometimes. Plus, when the car changes gears while I am driving they grind together. From what I have been told, this is because the gears are made from shoddy material. So, if the car takes a fair amount of abuse, the gears start to strip. Eventually, my transmission will need to be replaced.  .................................................................... One good point about the car is that it has electric seats. They adjust in so man ways it is impossible for you to be uncomfortable. They even have lumbar support. My husband who is 6' 2&quot; and is very picky about how he sits didn't have a complaint! Even on a long trip. Another is that it has  a neat little compartment under the floor in the way back that locks with your trunk key. This is really good for when you are on a many store shopping excursion. As long as you don't buy anything too big. It is also good to keep your dangerous car chemicals (antifreeze, ect) and tools in if you have kids.  ..................................................................... Even if I were given one of these cars for free I would probably think twice about taking it. I am not usually one to look a gift horse in the mouth but, when the horse comes with this much trouble you need to be wary.    ......................................................................Update 6/30/00  I had a reputable mechanic look at my car. One who has worked on my cars for years(My father). Guess what! My spark plug wires were bad. I only had four out of 6 cylinders firing. My fan wasn't working. So, the car was overheating. Plus Two of my motor mounts are gone. So that explains the transmission problem. Also a few other minor things were wrong, like the pcv valve hoses had dry rot, the spark plugs needed to be replaced, ect. Now that the car has been worked on some it is running much better. I was told a bold face lie by the so called &quot;Professional Mechanic&quot; I had brought the car to in the first place.( But that is another Opinion to Write!) Next time I'm taking my car directly to my Father!       <br><br>
