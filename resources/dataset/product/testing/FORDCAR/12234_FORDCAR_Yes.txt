            I have owned my Ranger for 4 years now.  I have put it in the shop for one problem since I have had it.  And that was when I put 143,000 miles on it.  It has been the most dependable automobile I have ever had.  I owned two other automobiles before it.
It is a 94 Ranger with a V-6, regular cab.  It has never once broke down on me.  The battery has never been dead.  The only thing I have changed on it has been the engine fluids and the clutch(at 143,000 miles).  I don't know how Ford did it, but they built probably the best compact truck available.
Not only do they run excellent, but they also look really good as well.  It does not take much to customize the Ranger either.  
I do however recomend the V-6 engine over the 4 cylinder.  You will understand if you test drive both.  The extra power comes in handy when needed.
My mom, sister, and I all drive Ford Rangers.  Another added bonus is that you can purchase one for under 13,000.00 dollars, brand new.
I have had a number of friends get stuck in mud(etc), and my Ford Ranger has pulled them out with little or no problem.  I have pulled many trailers and boats behind my truck as well and never once had a problem.
The only issue I have with the Ford Ranger is that in my regular cab, there is not a whole lot of room.  But if I was really upset about it, I would just go get an extended cab.
Overall, I have never known a small truck to perform as well as the Ford Ranger has.  I do recommend it to anyone who asks.<br><br>
