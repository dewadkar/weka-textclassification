            We just bought our Windstar in April of this year.  We tried out several other Makes of vans, even other newer Windstars, but none drove as smooth and quiet as this one.  At the end of April we drove it from Wisconsin to Las Vegas for our vacation, and it drove great. No problems what so ever.  It cost us $220.00 to drive there, through the mountains in Colorado.  We figured it would take that much for our car also , so it was average on gas.
   We like the back seat radio controls and plug in for cd or tape player. Also all seats are removable, except front, for loading up with whatever. Drives really well up and down the mountains without having to shift gears.  never had to add oil once during our whole vacation, which was two weeks.  
  The only thing that surprised me is when you drive behind a semi, it starts wobbling really bad, but I think that is with any van.
   Heater works great and very seldom have to have it on high. Air conditioning vents in the ceiling quickly cools the whole van.
