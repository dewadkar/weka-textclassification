            I bought my '99 Explorer in 2002 with 60,000 miles on it. To begin, I'll say that I have been satisfied with the truck. I hope to keep this truck for many many miles and years, it's enjoyable to drive and it's a good looking vehicle. There are some drawbacks to this vehicle, though. 

Firstly, I have the sport model; it has very little room for an SUV. Keep this in mind, the vehicle seems bigger than it is, especially if your previous vehicle was a car rather than an SUV. Once you rock this thing around town a few times and try to bring three our four of your friends with you, you will realize that you should have gotten the four door, and you should have gotten something with a third row of seats. 

The second potential drawback is the 4.0 Liter SOHC motor. The 1999 came with two 4.0 Liter options, the SOHC motor and the pushrod engine (the X motor if you're looking at the VIN). The X motor is considered more reliable, and there is known technical issues with the SOHC engine. They SOHC motor had 'timing cassette' issues, which without going very deeply into the technicalities, is very expensive to fix. Stick with the X motor if purchasing the Explorer. 

The 1999 also had an issue with oil sending units and the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor. The oil sending unit wiring will come loose and cause the oil gauge to sit at the 0 PSI reading, this isn't a huge deal unless you don't realize what is going on and a dealer charges you a few hundred dollars to correct the issue. The MAF sensor tends to get dirt and grime on its resister which makes the computer think that the engine is running lean of fuel, which sets a Check Engine light. This also isn't a huge deal, again barring huge dealer charges for diagnosis for those who don't know any better. 

I have read a lot of reviews of this vehicle (not just from epinions, but some of them I don't agree with.  I understand that many people are very impressed with the smooth shifting of the automatic overdrive transmission.  I would debate how smooth it really is, I think each shift is pretty noticable.  For me this is a good characteristic, as I like the feel of a solid shift.  However, if you are thinking about an explorer based on the "smooth" and "inperceptable" shifting of the automatic transmission, your probably looking at the wrong vehicle.  The engine shows very good power for a 4.0 liter 6 cylinder.  Any major towing will require the V8, and if you drop back to te 1998 model, you will have the option of the 5.0 liter engine, which is very nice.  For daily driving and hiway combat, the 4.0 pushrod motor is more than sufficient.  

I've taken the truck off road a couple of times.  It actually improves in handling when on the trails.  What on the hiway might be percieved as a rough ride, is on the trail a very nice and stable performance.  I really like this truck in the tall grass.  On the hiway, though, it can get a little rough, especially if your in Missouri where the hiways are horrible.  I personally got used to the road feel, some people I've talked with have not.  I recomend an extended test drive before buying this truck, make sure its for you.  I would recomend it highly, but I like driving, I like working on vehicles (but nothing major), I like the feel of the road.  If you just want to slip in your vehicle and forget that you ever left your couch, this may not be the truck for you.
