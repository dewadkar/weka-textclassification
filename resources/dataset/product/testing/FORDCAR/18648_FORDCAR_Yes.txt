            I never thought I would buy an SUV, but when I was in the market for a car, none of the models out there appealed to me. Cars in 1997 were ugly. So, I looked into an SUV.

I wanted some hauling capacity (I had always wanted a truck, but didn't like the fact that you couldn't lock up the back).

The fact that I am higher than I was in my GEO Storm is great. I love the roominess, although that comes with the typical price of lower gas mileage. The 6-way power seat on the drivers side is great, although I have little reason to adjust it now that it is in the right position. The CD changer works like a charm, and I love my remote keyless entry.

My Explorer Sport holds four people comfortably. I have never had occasion to carry any more. The split back seat allows you to carry long things in the back and still seat one person in the back.

I have had a few minor problems. I find my Explorer to be noisier than it should. I have wind noise. But, generally it has been a great truck. I'm very happy with my choice.

If you are going to buy an SUV, check on how much the insurance will cost compared to comparable models. I found that my explorer would cost $100 less a year to insure than a Chevy Blazer.
