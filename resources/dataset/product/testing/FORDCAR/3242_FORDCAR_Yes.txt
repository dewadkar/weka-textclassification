            The thing about Fords is that you either love them, or hate them.  There really seems to be no middle ground.  I had always drove GM vehicles all my life, up until my truck that is.  About 3 years ago I sold my car and I wanted a truck.  I bought a 2 year old '95 F-150 XL.  To be honest, the XL was and to my knowledge is the work truck model, quite utilitarian.  It came equipted with vinyl floors, no carpeting.  This worked out for me as I take my truck to the lake an aweful lot, and camping.  This way I can wash all the mud and dirt off the floor with little effort.  Also standard was a bench seat.  Not my idea of style, but hey, it isn't that bad.  It doesn't offer great support, but it is comfortable enough to do your driving from point A to point B.  My vehicle is a regular Cab model.

Ford had done an excellent job in making the '95 F-150 more car like than it's competition of the time.  It has &quot;Car like&quot; side mirrors.  Also, the dash is stylish, not the boxy, cheap looking dashes found in the Chev and Dodge back then.  While that really isn't tops on my shopping list, the fact that the dash included a full range of gauges was a nice touch.  The only thing excluded was the tach, but then again, my truck is an automatic, so it really isn't an issue.  Also a nice feature is the automatic overdrive.  It can be disable by the touch of a button nicely integrated at the end of the gear shift.  This comes in handy for hauling heavy loads, so you don't damage your automatic transmission.

The F-150's of '95 came with 3 engines.  The V6 is underpowered and gets negligable fuel economy improvements over the 5.0L V8 (302).  I have a 302 in my truck.  It has enough power and torque to haul some heavy loads.  I have had 1900lbs + in the back of the truck, and never any problems.  Also available is a 5.8L V8.  This engine provides even more power and torque.  The 5L has been more than enough for my suburban needs.  It has been ultra reliable, only requiring oil changes, and a rad flush since I bought it.  It also has started flawlessly in the cold Manitoba Winters.  I have had the vehicle start after sitting 20 hours in -40 degree Celcius weather, with out having the block heater plugged in.

Exterior styling is pleasant to the eye.  I have seen the extended cab model of this truck, and it looks great too.  There are many of these vehicles on the road, as they are North Americas top selling vehicle.  So finding parts is easy too.  I recently replaced the standard matte finish grill and headlight bezels with the chrome ones off an XLT model I found at the auto recker, that had been in an accident.  If I had to find a fault with the exterior of this vehicle it is the paint!  I know Ford has had problems in the past, and for the most part the finish of my vehicle is fabulous.  But the paint seems softer than what I was accustomed to with my GM Vehicles.  It didn't take more than a little rub up against my fence with the truck door, and I left a little mark.  

On the negative side of things, the engine noise is loud in the cabin.  And the ride is choppy.  But hey, this is a truck, remember?  I once again site the paint quality, but maybe that is just a personal thing.  Also, interior build quality is not what one would expect to see in a sedan.  The large &quot;plasticy&quot; glove box in my truck looks cheap.  

Over all, this has been a fabulous vehicle for me.  It looks and rides great.  It also has been trouble free!
