            Over the past five years, there has been an unprecedented increase in sales of SUVS.  The market has met demand, as there are many different types of SUVs, that cater to many different markets.  I'll go through these first.

<b> LUXURY SUVs </b>

As you would think, this category is defined by the price.  In this category, you will find both capable off-road machines, and those that are meant to be cars on steroids.  Some examples of the category...

Lexus RX300/RX470
Toyota Land Cruiser
Lincoln Navigator
Cadillac Escalade
BMW X5
Infiniti QX4
Mercedes M-Class
Acura MDX

the list goes on...

<b> MIDDLE CLASS SUVs </b>
This is the classic &quot;soccer mom&quot; SUV.  It's not too expensive, but it's no Kia either.  These are meant to be minivans with a little more edge, but do not perform especially well off-road.  These include...

Chevy Blazer/Oldsmobile Bravada
Ford Explorer/Mercury Mountaineer
Toyota 4Runner
Nissan Pathfinder
Honda Passport/Isuzu Rodeo
Dodge Durango
Jeep Grand Cherokee

<b> LOOK AT ME, I AM HUGE SUVs </b>
These are the ones that are big just for the sake of being big.  You know them when you see them.  These are..

Ford Excursion
Ford Expedition
Chevy Tahoe/GMC Yukon/Suburban

<b> OFF ROAD SUVs </b>
These can be defined as those on the market before the big boom, and have stayed the same.  The list is small...

Jeep Wrangler
AM General Hummer

<b> BABY SUVs </b>
There's a lot of these out there.  These always come in at under 30,000 dollars. They are technically SUVs, but are too small to serve the purpose of &quot;sport&quot;,  and barely handle &quot;utility.&quot; with few exceptions.  They are...

Toyota Rav4
Honda CRV
Chevy Tracker
Kia Sportage
Suzuki Vitara/Grand Vitara
Isuzu Amigo

The point of this list is to show that there are many brands of SUVs, and yet the Ford Escape manages to escape them all.  Technically, because of its 25,000 pricetag (tops), it would go into the Baby SUV category.  But, it is much larger and much more capable than any in that list.

The Escape is essentially a cheaper Explorer.  It is hardly smaller, and it has about the same power as a V6 Explorer.  They can be easily mistaken, except for when you look at the price on the window.

The Escape shares a platform and most of its body with the Mazda Tribute.  It is not the first V6 in the class, as the Grand Vitara already has one.  However, this v6 is much more capable.  It puts out 200 horsepower, which is more than the 160 horsepower a base Explorer gives.  It also has better suspension than the others in its class.  If you are in the market for a &quot;baby SUV&quot;, but want to go off road just a little bit, choose the Escape.  Hands down.

Just because it is powerful does not mean it is refined. Everything that is available to a middle class SUV is available to the Escape.  You can even have leather seats, which is unheard of in the market.  Also the ride when you are on the road is quite smooth and carlike, which is something that everyone shopping in this market is looking for.

Here's the bottom line.  Ford has always been one of the best makers of SUVs in the world.  They are the most popular, hands down.  Now Ford has entered the Baby SUV market, and has totally obliterated the competition.  The competitors will be scrambling to update their inferior selections.  If a Baby SUV is what you are looking for, I wholeheartedly recommend the Escape.  Heck, if you are looking for a middle class SUV, take the Escape, and go on vacation with the 5-10 thousand you save on your Escape, which is just as capable and spacious.
