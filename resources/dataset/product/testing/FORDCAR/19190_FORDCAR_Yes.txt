            I love my little Aspire, as silly as that might sound. It's the most stripped-down vehicle I've ever owned - kind of like the original VW Bug only more room. I bought it used (29,000 miles) because I was moving to the big city and wanted something that could zip in and out of tight spaces. I know very little about cars, but I think I made a good choice.

It's nothing fancy, but then, I'm not into fancy, I'm into getting around town in a dependable vehicle. I've had not one minute of problems with it; the only money I've spent on it so far (it has 45,000 miles now) is maintenance.

My Aspire handles well, turns on a dime, although it does not have power steering. On the highway it's kind of rough; it doesn't grip the road very well, especially during rain or wind. But it does fine around town and it's powerful enough to get out of the way.

If you want something sporty or powerful, this is not the car for you. If you're into functional and basic, it's just fine.<br><br>
