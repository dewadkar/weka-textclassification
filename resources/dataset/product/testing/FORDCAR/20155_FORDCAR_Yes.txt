            The 2000 Ford Windstar is an exceptional car.  I got it fully loaded and itis great to the best of my knowledge.  Ford makes great cars... I only have three problems with it:

1.  It has trouble going up steep inclines (like my driveway)
2. The headlights are not very bright
3. Sometimes the automatic doors freeze when it is very cold

Other then that the car is great.

When dropping my kids off for school, I no longer have to get out of the car to close the door.. Now, I have to press a button (inside the car, right next to me) and the doors close by themselves.  Its great and its no hassle.

Furthurmore, There is minimal trunk space, but when you take the back seats out it creates a lot.  Sometimes, my family of four doesn't even fill it up! (which is very rare considering we pack so much.)

The Ford Windstar is reasonably priced and fits great with a family of 3 to a family of 5.  (if your family is larger then 5 people, you should probally opt to get two WINDSTARS.


Other then that, its great for a family or people who are lazy to keep after a car.
