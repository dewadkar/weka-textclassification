            When I saw my first glimpse of the <b>Ford Focus ZX3</b>, I was walking along Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C. I had been looking around for a replacement car for my 1991 Toyota Tercel for a few months, so when I saw the ZX3, I stopped dead in my tracks. I was instantly in love. The styling of the ZX3 (and even that of the more sedate 4-door models) is young, fresh, sporty, and European in nature. From outside of the car, looking in, the occupants in front and back seemed to have plenty of room and be comfortable. I decided that I would stop by my local Ford Dealership on the way home that evening and take the Focus ZX3 out for a test drive.

A couple months after that initial test drive, I drove off the lot with my own Sangria Red 2000 Ford Focus ZX3. The decision to go with this car, rather than one of the three I had been considering previously, was made after careful research and several trips to the dealership to take the Focus out for a spin. Looking back, I don't think I could've made a better choice for myself.

<b>The ZX3 Experience...</b>

Two of the things that I wanted in a new car came standard on the base model ZX3: A CD player and 5-speed manual transmission. Actually, a lot of things came standard on the base model ZX3... 

<b>Take the speedy (yet still fuel efficient) and responsive 16 valve 2.0L engine</b>, for instance. Tied with the 5-speed manual, it's a dream. The more expensive SE and LS sedan models come standard with a 5-speed, but only the pricey elite ZTS sedan comes standard with the ZX3's peppy 2.0L engine.

<b>The ZX3 also comes standard with 15&quot; aluminum alloy rims</b>, an option that is not only attractive aesthetically, but improves the ride and handling of the vehicle tremendously. The Focus comes with high quality BF Goodrich Eagle tires right off the lot. They aren't Perellis or other high performance tires, but they are practical and the average driver won't need anything more than that.

One problem that I have noticed on the ZX3, however, is that there is a rather large an inconvenient blind spot on the driver's side, right over my shoulder. The column that has my seatbelt attached to it blocks an area that has caused me to almost merge INTO a couple of vehicles. Checking over your shoulder AND using your side mirrors before you make a move to change lanes is a must.

<b>The ZX3's standard factory sound system with detachable-face CD player</b> has incredible sound quality, as well as ease of use. The buttons are all big and accessible, so you don't even have to take your eyes off the road to change the station, track, or adjust volume. Speaking of volume, the stereo senses your speed, and in turn adjusts the volume automatically. On the few occasions that I have found this option inconvenient was when I had another person in the car who was trying to have a conversation with me... There was no way to get a good background music volume; the sound was either blaring or nonexistent. That, I feel, is an easy adjustment in volume range that Ford could make in later models. Another good thing about the automatic volume adjustment is that I may turn off the car with the system pumping at piercing levels, but when I climb back in later, the volume has been adjusted to a comfortable level. And lastly, I about fell over when I realized that the CD player had a detachable face. I find that incredible in a factory system.

<b>The ZX3's driver's seat has a height-adjustment option</b> that I have only seen on more expensive luxury vehicles. I loved this option. It mattered way more than I ever thought it would, making the drive more comfortable for me in all my 5'3&quot; glory; I can see over the steering wheel! The crank for height adjustment is located under the seat, and was a little weird to use at first, but once my seat was adjusted, I didn't find the strange crank a problem at all. Unless someone messes with it, I won't have to use the crank again at all.

<b>The ZX3 comes in lots of very attractive colors.</b> I know, I know... What does this REALLY matter, right? But, if I'm going to dish out almost 13K for a vehicle, it's going to be in a color I like. I'm sure that most of you are the same way. I picked the Sangria Red, but the ZX3 also comes in dark blue, blue green, dark green, orange, bright red, white, silver, black, and gold.

<b>The seats in the ZX3 are comfortable</b>, and the upholstry colors, while far from boring, are in harmony with the rest of the interior design. About a month after purchasing my ZX3, I took a 1500-mile round trip behind the wheel, as well as in the passenger's seat. The first part of the trip (a good 11 hours behind the wheel), seemed to fly by with as little discomfort as can be expected for such a long period of sitting still. My lower back did not bother me on this trip, as had been the problem in the past with the rock-hard, unsupportive seat in my Tercel. The only thing I think these seats could use is the option to adjust the amount of lumbar support you recieve.

<b>The interior of the ZX3 is roomy and well-designed.</b> I have heard some people say the dash looks strangely strained or over-designed. But I believe the contrary: it's convenient and fun to look at. The only beef I have with the dash is that on the passenger's side, the cupholder is a little cramped by the dash column above it, and even if I get a small drink at a fast-food joint, I have to maneuver the cup strangely to get it to sit correctly. 

I am, unfortunately, a smoker, so I have used the ashtray in this vehicle quite a bit. If it matters to any of you, I found the ashtray location a little awkward to use, but I suppose that I should quit anyways, and this wouldn't be a problem for me anymore, now would it? The rest of the interior is wonderfully designed, with all the buttons for air, heat, and vents easy to find without taking your eyes off the road, and the vents themselves are very easy to adjust for air flow. 

The quality of the materials that make up that dash are the only thing I truly call into question... I have noticed recently that parts of the dash have paint that's chipped off, revealing black plastic beneath that is in stark contrast to the gray and silver of the rest of the interior. There seems to be no reason for the paint to have chipped off; I have never seen this happen before. It is something that I am bringing up with the dealership when I take the car in for it's next scheduled oil change.

<b>The backseats in the ZX3 are suprisingly roomy and comfortable</b>, with an amazing amount of headroom available. The amount of footroom available to backseat passengers varies greatly, but even with the front seats pushed all the way back on their tracks, passengers have found leg and knee room acceptable for short trips. Longer trips may cause problems for the taller passengers who must climb in the back.

<b>The ZX3's hachback trunk provides a great amount of room</b>, whether it be for groceries, moving boxes, or a wheelchair. I have had all three shoved into this amazing vehicle, and with the fold-down seats, I haven't had any problem fitting what I've needed to fit into this vehicle, within reason. Remember, folks, this isn't a Silverado. But for a small, compact car, I couldn't ask for an easier car to pack all my stuff into.

<b>Lastly, the ZX3 is just a FUN car to drive.</b> I really couldn't have asked for a better car. It offers me all the power, drive, and comfort that I could have ever wished for in a compact car. The price is amazingly right for this fine piece of machinery, well worth every cent I handed over to Ford to have the privledge to drive off the lot. A couple of months after I bought my car, Ford send me a Focus Care Package that included this cute digital sport watch that I wear almost every day now. How cool is that? They definitely know their demographic. 

I absolutely love this car; love to drive it, love to look at it, love to clean it and care for it. I just plain love it. I am proud of my purchase, and I love all of the attention that I get when I'm out in it. I have people asking me about the car almost everyday, and I do not hesitate to tell them all about it. Everyone gets an earful!

The ZX3 wasn't voted 2000's <b>Car of the Year</b> in America, Canada, in Europe for nothing. Go find out for yourself! Test drive the wonderful Ford Focus ZX3 today!<br><br>
