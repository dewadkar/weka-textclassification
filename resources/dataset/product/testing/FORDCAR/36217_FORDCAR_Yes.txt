            The 2000 Ford Focus is an excellent car.  The handling is exceptional due to Macpherson suspension on the front and independent rear suspension.  The telescoping steering column makes it easier to get comfortable.  The controls for the cruise control are easy to distinguish without looking.  The seats are some of the most comfortable I have ever sat in.  The drivers seat has a height adjustment the can raise or lower the seat approximately one and a half inches.  The leg room is more than would be expected in a compact car.  I being 6'1&quot; can easily leave the seat part way forward for more leg room in the rear and still be comfortable.  The back could have seat releases inside rather than just in the trunk.  Speaking of the trunk,  it has much more room than other compact cars have had in the past.  Overall the 2000 Ford Focus is an excellent car with the 2.0 engine getting between 25 and 33 mile to the gallon depending on the type of driving.  I would recommend this car to anyone who needs good gas mileage,  room,  and comfort. This car is a well designed and built automobile.<br><br>
