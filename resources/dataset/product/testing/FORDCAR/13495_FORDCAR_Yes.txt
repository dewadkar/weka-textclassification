            I purchased my '99 Ford Explorer in May of '99.  As to this date I've not regretted this purchase.  I received great service from my Ford dealer.  There have been several recalls but now of them of any great importance. I have 2 teenage children and they both have plenty of room.  The model I purchased was an Eddie Bauer and it has all available options with the exception of the moon roof and the CD changer.  My explorer was put to it's first test about a month after it's purchase when we had to make an emergency trip to Dallas (we're stationed at Camp Lejeune, NC).  This vehicle performed great on the highway and especially through the mountain regions of I-40.  A draw back for me oh this vehicle was I went from driving a Mitsubishi Diamante to driving this SUV, this Ford is obviously larger and it felt like it might roll the first couple of times when forced into urgent breaking situations. Just give yourself time to adjust if going from a car to a larger vehicle as such.  As far as trips to the dealer for repairs, it's been to the dealer 4 times for repair of the rear wiper unit, the dealer admitted to Ford having this problem with this line of vehicles.  Basically it has a mind of it's own, works when it wants and hopefully I won't be going through all that again.   Excellent audio system with a standard Mach system.  An all of this is at a mere insurance symbol 8. Ford offered on the lot financing that beat all the banks and credit unions.    <br><br>
