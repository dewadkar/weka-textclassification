            I went out in 1989 to buy my first new vehicle. When all was said and done, I bought a 1990 Bronco II.  I have friends who owned this vehicle, and they highly recommended it.  I am still driving it.  She has got a few hail dents on the hood, and almost 100,000 miles on her.  She and I have gone through college, and three moves together.  I rarely have to fix anything on her, and those things have been fairly minor.  A muffler needed replaced, and  the electric motors for the windows needed replaced this year.  The shock lifts on the back also got replaced this year.  These are things that I had to pay for out of my own pocket when the warranty ran out.  When she was under warranty, I took it in a few times.  Those times included work on the A/C, a recall on something, and the radio exchanged out.  All in all, I think I got a really really great sports vehicle.  I planned to drive it until it just can't move even with  mechanic's style CPR.  I love my vehicle.  I have had many offers of people wanting to buy it, and my answer has always been the same.  &quot;It isn't for sale, and if you really like it, try a used car lot for one.&quot;  Ford stopped making Bronco II's in 1990, so until someone peels my hands off the steering wheel, and tells me it can't be revived.  You can see me in my maroon and silver Bronco II riding the range.<br><br>
