            I've had my 1995 Mustang for 4+ years and I love it!  It's a very fun car to drive.  It has been very reliable and, due to regular maintenance, has never been in the shop for repair -- other than for the pesky 'check engine' light, which fortunately was a problem with the light and not the engine.

There is a button to turn off the overdrive (this prevents the car from attempting to shift into 5th gear) when going up steep hills.  This works fine, but going up steep hills causes it to 'rattle' even though the engine has sufficient power.

The front seats have ample leg room and are very comfortable.  However, the back can quickly get cramped.  A person over 5'6&quot; would probably not be comfortable for any length of time, if at all.  It is best used as a two-person vehicle.  I wouldn't recommend it for someone who needs easy access to or frequent use of the back seat.
