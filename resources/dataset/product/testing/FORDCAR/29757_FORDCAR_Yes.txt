            This is the King of the SUV in my opinion. I am presently driving my second Ford Explorer.  The ease of handling on the road combined with roomy interior were the two strongest selling points for me. This is a much heavier vehicle than the Jeep Grand Cherokee...Just open the hood on an explorer and there is no comparison.  This makes me feel much safer knowing that there is more metal between me and a crash!!!! I love the fact that the passengers in the back seat can control their own heat and air conditioning. There are numerous features that make riding in this vehicle a pleasure.  Passengers can plug into the sound system with a headset while others can carry on a normal conversation! The front bucket seats are the most comfortable I have ever ridden in. If you want a comfortable, dependable ride...try the Ford Explorer.  <br><br>
