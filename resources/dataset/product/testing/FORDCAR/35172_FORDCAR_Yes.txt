            I found the car salesman of my dreams--one who didn't play the &quot;I have to ask the manager&quot; game.  He asked what I drove and if I was happy with that size car, and said he had just the car for me--the Ford Escort ZX2.  And he was absolutely right.  I not only got a car for under $12,000, but with such incredibly low interest that it wasn't worth taking money out of the bank to pay cash (I hated the idea of car payments).  

This car has get up and go over the mountains, gets fantastic mileage, and has not given me a single problem in the almost two years since I purchased it.

My only regret is not paying a little more and getting electric windows.  I did go for the remote security lock--no one should be without it.

My Escort is a stick shift, so I can't speak for the automatic ones.  This one handles like a dream.  

This car is for people who want a sporty looking car at a reasonable price.<br><br>
