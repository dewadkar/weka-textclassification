                  I really wanted to express to all the readers out there how much we love our full size Ford high top conversion.  We were looking for something big enough for a family of 5 but with options the kids like as well as us.  No vehicle out there compares to a full size van conversion.
      Our van has a beautiful limo like interior, with mood lights, TV, VCR, Nintendo hookup, and headphones, so the kids can watch TV or a movie and we can still enjoy the radio.  It also comes with built in dust buster which is always charging and ready for use.  The leather interior is actually easier to clean then any other interior we have had before.  The rear sets fold down into a bed when needed, ( for parents or kids ).
      This van is a lifesaver on long road trips.  Between the nintendo and the VCR, the kids are always happy and kept busy.  No other SUV can accomplish that and remain comfortable as well as reasonably priced.  May I suggest also looking for a demo model.  We found one with 6,000 miles on it and it was marked down from $38,000 to 30,000, and we talked them down to $25,000.  What a deal.  Well, hopefully this helps someone out there that is in the market for a big SUV, but has not decided on a particular type yet.<br><br>
