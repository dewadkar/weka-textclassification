                        In my opinion I would say that the Ford Ranger is one of the best mini trucks on the market. I have owned one for three years and nothing has ever gone wrong with it. They are very comfortable as long as you purchase an extended cab model because the regular cab models do not have much space inside. You can upgrade the Ranger with all power, four wheel drive and other great options that can make the Ranger a great ride. Also if you are interested in the show trucks these are very easy to make into a show truck. Also the aftermarket parts are not to high so you can fix a pretty nice showtruck for almost nothing. So, I believe if you are looking for a nice midsize truck I believe that the Ranger is a very good way to go.<br><br>
