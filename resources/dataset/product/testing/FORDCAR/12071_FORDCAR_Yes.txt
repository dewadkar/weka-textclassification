            I bought my 2001 F-150 XLT flareside 4.6l a.t.regular cab in July 2001 and have not been disappointed yet.There have been no problems (knock on wood) with the truck that I am aware of.My only dislikes are that the truck seems to wander slightly when you go over 65 miles per hour.I know this is not a race car and that the problem can most likely be fixed with some sort of after market product.My other problem is the tires on the truck (P235/70R16) are to small for the size of the wheel wells.You can get bigger tires but only at the expense of a package upgrade, otherwise Ford will void the warranty if you put bigger tires on.I can't wait till my warranty is up so I can beef this truck up a bit.My last problem is there could be a couple of more inchs (6-8) of room behind the seats so you can put some stuff back there without having to step up to the extended cab models.
