            I Bought a 98 model Ford Ranger step side almost a year ago. This truck had just over 18,000 miles on it when I bought it and it now has over 36,000 miles. The Ford Ranger power and horsepower is pretty good for the money, with it's dual over head cam high out put four cylinder it will not only haul a fairly good size load but it also has the power to get up and go when needed. I have the five speed model which I am very pleased with, the easy clutch and smooth shifting just adds to the ranger enjoyable and easy ride. The Ranger also has more ground clearness than most other trucks in it's class. Now as with any truck have no weight in the back can cause the back end of the Ranger to fish tall on wet roads, but the Ranger recovers well in most cases. The Ranger really is a all around fun go any where truck. <br><br>
