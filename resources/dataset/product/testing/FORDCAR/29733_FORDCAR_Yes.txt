            I got the explorer sport because my sister's lease was up and the price was pretty good, but it really has been great for everything that I've needed.  As a college student in the northeast that often needs to move a car load of stuff or people but don't really want to be driving a boat this car has filled my needs perfectly.

As far as the engine and other particulars everything has performed to my satisfaction.  I don't know all the benefits or what they give me, but I have never felt that it was underpowered or had any major service problems.  I did need to get a new clutch (at 38,000 miles) put in, but that was because it had not been driven correctly.  

It's important to know that the explorer sport truly is a truck in sheep's clothing.  Although it has a nice interior and all that good stuff, it feels like a truck as it accelerates and grips the road.  I have really like this aspect of the car because I feel more control.  Even still I don't feel tossed around when I hit a bump or something.

What I've really like about it has been how well it works with my needs.  I can easily give people rides places and still have a totally full back.  I would not say that the back two seats are very comfortable.  When going on a roadtrip, the back seat is a little undesirable but totally functional.  On shorter trips the back seat is fine.  It officially holds two people (with seatbelts) but three can squeeze easily.
