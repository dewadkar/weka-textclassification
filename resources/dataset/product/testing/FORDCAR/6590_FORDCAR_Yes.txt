            It has been one year to the day that I have owned my Ford F150 pickup and would like to share with you readers my thoughts and opinions about this product. The F150 is the best selling vehicle in the country and for good reason. The ubiquitous ford F150 is a favorite of small business owners as well as commuters who need a reliable inexpensive pickup. I purchased this vehicle for multi use and use it everyday for commuting as well as weekend getaways. I purchased this vehicle over the Dodge primarily because I liked the looks of it better (more aerodynamic) and chose it over GM's line because of price. The comparable GM was $3500 more expensive. This vehicle does not drive like a truck at all and with the exception of turning radius and height (4WD), drives and rides like a car. I like the ergonomic feel of the controls and smoothness of the ride.(my other vehicle is a Cadillac for comparison) The truck does shift kind of rough sometimes though with a lurch from first into second. The truck has 17000 miles on it now and the brakes are starting to squeak somewhat on hot days and especially in traffic. (I have the 4 wheel disk brake package). If you are looking for economy this truck is probably not for you. I have been getting 16 MPG average city/Highway. I have the Triton V8 in this pickup and I wouldn't suggest getting a smaller engine especially the V6 that is standard in this pickup. I had one of these before I realized that the engine is just too small for a vehicle of this weight and size. I have 3 small boys that I throw into the back seat with ample room for them. Adults would have a hard time back there and I wouldn't want to travel more than 100 miles in the back seat myself. One last note is that I feel very safe and confident in this vehicle. I live in an area that gets snow and ice in the winter and the 4WD coupled with the ABS makes the vehicle feel rock solid. I also have the tow package on this vehicle because I tow a horse trailer. Towing is a breeze with this pickup with ample power. I use this truck pretty hard and don't baby it. I expect it to have a useful life of about 20 years. Buy this pickup if you like the simplicity of Ford products and a safe vehicle. Don't buy this soley for commuting or the occasional trip to the lumberyard - buy a mid-size or small pickup instead. By the way, get the invoice price from edmunds.com before you negotiate with the dealer, you'll save thousands. 
UPDATE:
I am adding this addendum now that I have owned this for two years. Still no major problems. The fuel economy got better as it broke in. I now have 36K miles on it with no regrets for purchasing this vehicle. I still like its solid feel and looks. Resale is not bad either.
