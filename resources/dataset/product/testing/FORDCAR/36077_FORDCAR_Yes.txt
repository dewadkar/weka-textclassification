            When I first heard about the Focus last year, I thought that it cost about $2000 more then it did. I loved this car. I especially liked the SE wagon and the ZTS sedan the best. In December 1999, we went to a Ford dealer and test drove a wagon. It was great! We are planning to buy one around December 2000.
The Focus has Ford's new "edge" design also found on the Mercury Cougar.I think that they should make leather seats an option on the SE too as they are on the ZTS. The Zetec has plenty of power, but a 6-cylinder would be better. The problem is that there is not enough space for it under the hood. I love how the controls are arranged. the dash is very sporty. The trunk is very large for a sub-compact car. I like the standard cargo cover on the wagon and the standard alarm system. when you sit in the Focus, you feel like you are in a more expensive car that you can only dream of owning. Well, you don't have to dream with the Focus. There is plenty of room in the front and back seats. 

The stereo system works very well. An am/fm cassette player is standard on the LX and the SE. A cd player is standard on the ZX3 and the ZTS and optional on the SE. The memory button panel can be removed by pushing a small button on the cassette player. If removed, the radio will not work.  This is a great feature. Also, fog lights are standard on the ZX3 and included in the SE sedan sport package which is an option on the SE sedan. Wood panels and door pieces are standard on the ZTS and a silver radio panel is standard on the ZX3. A five speed manual trans is standard on all vehicles except the wagon. A Ford dealer told us that it will be on the wagon in 2001 though. 

A moon roof and power seats are not available for 2000, but may be for 2001. This is a great car! You can build your own at www.ford.com. Good luck!
