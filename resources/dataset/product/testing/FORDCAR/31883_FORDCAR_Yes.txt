            I have A 1997 Ford Escort Wagon LX. It was bought new off the lot. This can is great for people with young children that can't yet afford a van.
For starters it's very economical. We average 29 miles per gallon. It's also great for stop and go city traffic. With the large trunk and fold down seats you can pretty much put anything in there. It's really easy and fun to drive and that's what i live about it. We opt. for the stereo up-grade, and have the security system with the key less entry. It has a 2.0 liter in-line 4 with a 4-speed automatic engine. We haven't had any problems with our car except that the transmission made a rattling sound from about 3,000 miles to 9,000 but you only heard it when you reved the car really hard. From what we know we weren't the only people with that sound and that it wasn't unusual and it goes away. I also recommend to go with the all season up-graded tires they might be louder, but are the best for driving under all kinds of weather conditions- believe me cause I've been thru it all in that car. So if your looking to buy a great versitile car under $15,000- fully loaded, then this is the car for you!
