                  Until 1998 Dodge was the only supplier of full size V10 powered pickups, but Ford has since added a 6.8 liter V10 to compliment this heavyweight. While not as bold as the 1999 Dodge ram V10, the F-250 V10 offers great competition. The 1999 Super Duty F-250 is offered in 4 models, the 2 door regular cab, the supercab, the 2 door 4x4, and the 4 door 4x4 extended cab.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>
  

  When you settle yourself behind the wheel of the 1999 Ford F-250 4 door extended cab, there really is no telling the difference between its little brother, the F-150. This all changes however when you start the engine. Although the F-250 Super Duty comes standard with a 235 horse powered 5.4 liter V8, and has an optional 7.3 liter Turbo Diesel V8, the 6.8 V10 is the most powerful and is noticed immediately with the robust exhaust note. With 275 horse power on tap with the V10, you would think <b>performance</b> would be kinda sluggish, this considering the vehicle weighs nearly 9,000lbs. 275 horse power moving this weight seems almost 'lude.' But the V10 does an excellent job moving this weight, especially with it's 410 lb-ft of torque at a low 2,750 RPM. My test truck was matched with a 4-speed fully automatic transmission, which did a great job shifting to get the most power out of this engine. From a stoplight, the V10 powered F-250 moves effortlessly , and does so with the sound of an aggressive growl. The Triton V10 offers excellent performance, and hauling up to 10,500lbs can be accomplished. Cruising at highway speeds is not exactly quiet, but the F-250 offers a relatively quiet ride. Handling is not really the F-250's strong point, but for such a a large truck, it does quite well. It rides and drives much like an F-150, and feels very composed. The steering is perhaps a little too light, and lacks the feel of the road. The F-250 does roll around corners, but for a truck this size roll in most cases is inevitable. Brakes in my test truck were of the 4-wheel disc variety and included 4-wheel ABS. For a vehicle of this magnitude, the F-250 V10 stopped fairly well, but if you are used to driving small cars, beware! 

<b>NOTE</b>
expect to get around 10 MPG with the V10 on the freeway, also 5 and 6-speed manuals are available.  

  The Super Duty series offers a Strong, steel box-section <b>chassis</b>, which lies beneath the cab. The <b>suspension</b> is identical to its smaller brother, with coils at the front, and leaf springs at the rear in two-wheel drive form, or live axles front and rear when offered with the 4wd.  

  <b>About the Engine(s)</b>: Ford has gone the more modern route with the engine design. All engines offered are of overhead cam design. The 6.8 liter V10 is based on the Base 5.4 V8, and features stepped connecting rod journals and a balanced shaft which results in smooth power delivery. There is also a 7.3 liter Turbo Diesel Engine, that offers much more torque, but less power.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

   The <b>interior</b>, like the F-150 is very 'car like'. The F-250 SD has easy to read instruments, a modern dash, logically placed controls. The drivers position is excellent, and so are the seats. A split bench up front that offers loads of comfort and support. Some amenities included a center console, power everything, power seats, cruise control, a tachometer, a cold Ac, and dual air bags. The rear is fairly easy to get in and out of, with the 4 doors this compliments easy access. Room is ample everywhere, even in the rear, the F-250 SD offers seating for 5-6 adults.

     <b>Price & reliability</b> With all the options my test truck had, the price 'brand new' tipped the scales at nearly $32,000.  Base trim lines started at around $22,000.  Today, and when I test drove this truck in 2001, prices were still very high, my test truck was still over $26,000, and I'm sure the base models are still going to be pretty high as well. I do not own this vehicle, so I can not comment on reliability, it was just a test drive, I suggest going to Consumer Reports, or just asking around. The Dealer told me the SOHC V10 was one of the most reliable engines in the world, but as we all know, dealers will 'most of the time' do anything, or say anything to sell a vehicle.  


<i>Conclusion:</i>

 If you are going to go with a Ford F-250 you probably will be better off going with the less powerful trim lines. With the gas you'll spend filling up this massive truck's tank, you could buy yourself a Hummer. As a truck for the big rig enthusiast this vehicle is recommended 100%
