                Hello my name is Bodie. I bought the ford focus hatchback.  There were several reasons I did.  The first, was that I had an American truck. And, by knowing this, I knew that Ford would give me a better deal on the the trade in.  Also, because I wanted a car.

  A small car.  One that is quick easy to drive,and gets good gas mileage.  The Ford Focus is all of that and more.  What I love about the Focus, is its futuristic body style. 

In my opinion it is very original.  Plus, the stereo for a factory unit is very good. I have no complaints there.  It's very roomy and more foot and storage space compared to it's counterpart the Honda Civic.
 
 The Focus also has a larger and more powerful engine.  I really don't have any complaints on the car, as of yet, but we will see.
So far, it has got the job done and that is to get me to work, and not spend a lot of money on gas.  

The people who should buy the car, are people who are looking to spend a lot of money,and are looking for a sporty, reliable car.  <br><br>
