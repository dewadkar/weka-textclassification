            I received a '95 Ford Mustang as a gift on my 16th birthday.  I picked this specific car because it was a fun, stylish, and sporty vehicle that was affordable enough for a first car.  My family definitely got it's money's worth.  I've been driving this car for five years and the only problem it has had with the mechanics on the car is the alignment got slightly off track.  Inside the car is a different story.  The makers of this car did not do a perfect job gluing in the accessories.  In the last year, the interior door molding (where the handle is) came unglued and came off the door.  Also, the hook that holds the visor came off.  Finally, the paneling by the radio, air conditioning, and stick shift has started to peel.  Other than that, everything else is in tack.  The air conditioning has never had a problem.  It drives really smooth, and it corners very well.  The pickup as it changes gears is quick and smooth.  I love driving the Ford Mustang and hope to trade it in the future for a 2000 Mustang.  (or maybe a newer one than that)<br><br>
