            After months of test driving just about every compact car in the marketplace, I finally unloaded my 1996 GMC Jimmy 2-door and bought a 2001 ZX3.  I know - quite a change, but I wanted something cool, but economical, and the ZX3 has delivered thus far.  

Like I said, I spent every weekend driving my wife nuts testing out Civics and Sentras and Proteges (oh, my!).  I usually had to pry myself out of them with a can opener.  The decision to purchase the ZX3 was made almost the instant I sat in the car - I am 6'4" and used to driving an SUV - when I realized that I actually had plenty of headroom and MORE lateral room than in my truck. 

I opted for the 5-speed tranny to eek every last bit of performance out of the 2.0 liter Zetec engine.  Other than that, my car has just about all the options save for the 6-disc changer and hand-cranked moonroof.  It also got the "Performance" package with the 16" 6-spoke aluminum wheels wrapped in 205/50 rubber.  AWESOME...

Don't get me wrong, this is no Mustang GT or Trans Am, but if you keep the tach in the 3000+ range, this car is a blast to drive.  It sticks in the corners and feels solid on the highway even at 70+ MPH.  

The rear seats fold totally flat, and I've already made several trips to Home Depot carrying closet doors and other oversized items with no more difficulty than I had in the Jimmy.

When I talk about places to put "stuff," what I mean is that there really is no good resting place for a cell phone, palm pilot, Altoids, change, etc.  Someone on the design team did, however, decide that to the left of the parking brake should be a pen-holder.  Why?  I just don't know.  I guess you could put your cell phone on the passenger seat, but taking a left turn to quickly (see above comments about handling) and you'll jettison the phone out the window.  I usually stash my cell phone in one of the cup holders and the Altiods in the other.  This is about all they're good for.  

The cup holders are kind of shoved up under the dash.  Try fitting in anything taller than a coffee mug, and it's like threading the needle.  A Big Gulp is out of the question.  My advice: Buy a can of Scothguard because you're going to be holding your Big Gulp between your knees.  (PLEASE don't try this with coffee!!)

Incidentally, I drove the ZTS as well (that is the most well-equipped Sedan) and I enjoyed it.  My wife, though, already has a 4-door so I wanted the ability to haul a little more stuff in the hatchback.
