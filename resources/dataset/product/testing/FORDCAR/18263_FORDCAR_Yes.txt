                 Okay, I was driving my 1985 Jeep Cherokee when my transmission exploded for the fortieth time.  I decided cars were evil, malignant creatures and they should be done away with forever and we should find some form of transportation involving those transporters from Star Trek.  But then, I found my Ford Escort!
    
      It was a 1991, with some rust on the wheel wells.  But, it was only 300 bones!  I mean, how could I go wrong?   That darn Jeep cost me 1200$!  I figured it would last a few months till I could get something better.  But, lo and behold, a year has gone by and NO problems with it!  It's zippy, too.  I blew away a Beretta GT  (Mine has a 1.9 liter engine, some have 1.8's I guess) and my friend's 1998 Subaru Legacy at a red light.  Oh, I mean, my friend did.  I would never race at a stop light, that's illegal..... I also got cocky and tried it with Mustang 5.0.  Well, sometimes, we need a lesson in humility.. Anyways, for a nine year old wagon, this thing is fast both off the line and goes 85-90 MPH no problems.  It gets 30+ MPG highway, around 22 city.  Not too shabby!  It's a 5 speed manual, I haven't heard good things about the autos. It's roomy, but there are some squeaks that have me vaguely worried.  Engine's really quiet though.  If you're looking for a good, reliable car, you can't beat these things!  BTW, don't look for them for 300$, The guy who sold it to me was a complete idiot.  

On a sadder note, I recently crashed this car into the back of another one.  Totalled it.  But, I got him as good as he got me.  And of course, guess what I hit?  Who said a Beamer?  That's right, I killed a BMW 328i.  I am so proud.
