            <b>General</b>
I've always been a "four wheels and an engine" kind of guy, you know, "point A to point B".  I'm not into $30,000+ vehicles, in fact, I've never paid more then $12,000 for any vehicle I've ever owned.  I feel that a vehicle is the worst possible investment a person could possibly make.  In fact, vehicles are right up there in the ranks of worst investments along with penny stocks and Arizona Beachfront Property.

<b>My Entourage</b>
One thing is evident though, you need one to get where you're going, unless you live in the city and use public transportation.  I've owned a few "junkers" in my time, in fact, I have one right now that I use to commute back and forth to work in.  It's an '86 AMC Renault Alliance that gets close to 40 miles to the gallon and only has 29,000 original miles on it (for real, I found out it was an elderly lady that owned it previously, she was the one and only owner of the car as well).  Everyone makes fun of it, but you know what, it gets me back forth to work at minimum cost and I'm not putting unwanted miles on my Explorer.

<b>Started to stray (sorry), back to the subject</b>
Anyway, back to the Explorer.  I have the 1995 Eddie Bauer edition Explorer.  I just bought it a few weeks ago and it had 74,000 miles on it.  I got both the Renault and the Explorer from a private dealership in Stannards, NY for $11,500.  The previous owner was the original owner, just like the Renualt.

<b>PROS:</b>
-Very, very comfortable, leather seats and power everything!
-CD changer, sunroof, AC, tilt, cruise, system monitor
-Front and rear climate control
-Very roomy, rear seats fold down for extra cargo space
-Rides like a dream, very smooth ride
-Luggage rack, class III towing package
-4WD high(auto)/low

<b>CONS:</b>
-Not very efficient on gas, I get around 15 miles/gallon
-Sluggish on hills, especially while towing a trailer
-I expected more from the 4.0L V6
-Roll-overs possible, from what I've read about this SUV

<b>Looking Forward</b>
As you can see, I haven't owned this vehicle very long, therefore there isn't much to the CONS list.  I'm sure that after a few months I'll have more to report on both lists, I'll be sure to update this Epinion at that time.  As far as the gas mileage goes, I really haven't owned a large vehicle before, so for all I know, 15 miles/gallon might be okay.

<b>Final Recommendations</b>
All in all, I would recommend this vehicle to anyone, as long as you know the vehicle has been taken care of.  I know that the used car thing is not for everyone.  I'd prefer to pay a little less to get a decent vehicle that has some mileage on it, but I know not everyone thinks the same way, so be sure your comfortable buying something that is used.

Also, I'd like to recommend Dave's Auto Center to anyone that is in the area.  Stannards is just south of Wellsville, NY, east of Olean, NY or west of Elmira, NY.  Dave is an honest car dealer (yes, I actually used the words "honest" and "car dealer" in the same sentence, this was not a mistake).  He was up front about everything about both vehicles I bought from him.

Dave's Auto Center is run by David Davis right out of his home, so you know he's not out to rip you off (because, you obviously know where he lives!).  He has a limited selection, but he can find almost anything you want.  Dave spent a few years as a manager at a dealership in Wellsville, NY, so he knows the business pretty well.  If you're in the area, it might worth the trip.
