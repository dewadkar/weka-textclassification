            It took me a few months to make a decision: my old 1993 Mercury Tracer Wagon reached sixty thousand miles on the clock, and although still ran perfectly, I felt it was the time for a change. I have always been a Ford person, I have to confess. To be more specific: a Mercury guy. Besides the 1993 Tracer Wagon, I owned a 1995 Mystique and a 1995 Sable LTS. I also have to acknowledge that I lost my interest in Ford's products after the body style change applied to 1997 Tauruses and Sables: I thought that they were the ugliest vehicles on the roads!

And finally, I had to get rid of my small wagon. What am I going to look at? A Corolla? Perhaps, a Cavalier or a Civic? In June of 1999, I took a trip to Poland to visit my in-laws (my wife's from there). While trying to stay calm stuck in the traffic jam in Warsaw behind the wheel of our rented Opel Astra (a GM car made in Poland and Germany, equivalent to Saturns in the United States), I noticed this strangely shaped white car: a cross between an 1950's French Citroens, contemporary German Volkswagens, and a Swedish little Volvo's (not yet known in America). That was it! Love from the first sight!

I bought my 2000 Ford Focus SE Sedan (white, of course) in March of 2000. The car is roomier than it appears, incomparably less noisy than Escorts and Tracers, and the SE trim level will offer you &quot;the all power&quot; stuff you might want (except for the power seats which would be a desired and necessary addition, especially for five-foot tall women like my wife).

The car handles great! It seems a little sluggish during the highway merging attempts, but I would still take this car over the four-cylinder Mercury Mystique or Ford Contour (both too heavy for their powerplants).

The price is right: my SE sedan was only around $15,000.00 range and with the low financing in lieu of rebates, it really grows big in my eyes.
