            I like my Love my F150 it is a 1997 F150 supercab, black 4.6l v8 automatic, two wheel drive. The thing sits on 265/75/16,it has the look to make the heads turn, and I have an exhaust system on it that makes the neighbors all look, all you perspective ford buyers, this truck is incredible, when I got rid of my Bronco I looked at them all Dodge, Chevy and Ford the F series is the best out there, they are the smoothest and the most plush, I would only change one thing, It needs a shade more power from the 4.6, it gets the job done but it really needs a little more punch, the stereo is great and the seats are incredible, unlike the rock hard offereings from Chevy and Dodge, the only thing this truck lacks to the bowtie and the mopar is power but if you just want an excellent truck buy the ford you will not be disappointed.<br><br>
