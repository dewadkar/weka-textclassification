            My girlfriend first told me she wanted a truck I downed the idea, because I am a car man. I never liked trucks, no room. So she brought it home and to my surprise it looked good. She got the Sports package with a sunroof and back leather cove. I liked the ride, not bouncy or stiff, just like a car. So then I got to drive it once, and the first thing I noticed was the fact of being up high. I though " this is going to hard to move around in real traffic " but I was wrong. It handled just like a car. Turns nice, but parking was what I expected. The steering wheel just grinds when you can't turn anymore. But overall it was great. The super cab has room for one adult or two small kids. They have seat belts for each side. Now if you want to go on a trip, you might want to load luggage in the truck bed. The 4 wheel drive works nice, it got us through the winter just fine. Our drive was our worst nightmare, but not this year. The only big flaw was fish-tailing on ice and slippery roads. Drive slow or get sand bags.... a lot of sandbags.
