            Oh, if they hadn't discontinued making this van, I would have bought another!!!  We own a 1994 Aerostar that we ordered new with options that we wanted and needed. If you can find a good used Aerostar, you might really find a good buy, depending on your needs.

So, why did we buy an Aerostar?  First of all, I wanted a vehicle for towing my Starcraft tent camper on local and long distance trips. Secondly, I needed room for two teenage boys, my wife and all the luggage and stuff we haul when camping and/or traveling to see our families.  And, I hoped to get a minivan that would handle western NY winters.  Finally, I didn't want to spend a fortune (but I did spend more than I planned).

So, were we pleased? Yes - this van has been great for traveling.  My sons can recline in the rear captain's chairs and relax or sleep while we are on the road.  The third seat has provided extra seating for carrying friends of the kids and extra cargo.  The third seat also folds down when needed.  There is just a tremendous amount of room for people and cargo. Gas mileage averages around 18 mpg (13-15 when towing my 2,000 lb. trailer), which is better than what I average with my new 6 cylinder Explorer (read and rate my review, please).

Reliable - yes, this has been a reliable van.  It now has over 87,000 miles on it, and repairs have been a minimum.  The air flow sensor had to to be replaced, and I think that was the only repair needed other than normal items such as shocks, brakes, tires etc.  Believe it or not, I'm still using the original battery - five years is a long time for batteries in our climate.

When I first purchased this van, I wondered how my wife would like driving it, and how would it handle in the snow.  Well, my wife loves driving vehicles that are a little higher off the ground and she likes the visibility she has in the van. The length can be a little long when backing out of tight parking lots (our van is the extended length), but we have gotten use to it, and we just proceed carefully.  I wish the back-up lights were a little brighter.  As to handling the snow, I was quite surprised at how it handles in snow.  The limited slip rear axle really helps, and to be safe, I use snow tires on the rear in the winter.  You will notice a difference in winter driving if you take out the third seat - the extra weight over the drive axle does help.  If you really get need traction, try a couple of tubes of sand in the back for added weight.

Honestly, if they had still been producing this van, especially with the new SOHC engine found in newer Fords, I would have purchased another.  Obviously, anyone reading this review is probably considering purchasing a used van - so check it out carefully and good luck!!

September 2000 Update!  O.k.....my van is very close to 99,000 miles, and it still runs great.  I had to have a switch replaced in the steering column which was causing the &quot;check air bag&quot; light to flash. Other than that, I just keep driving it....and I'll probably keep it for two to three more years unless it gives me major trouble. I still wish they made the aerostar...better value for the buck than the Explorer (see my review!).
