            I have owned a Ford Escort for a little over eight years. I bought it from a guy I work with and he took good care of it. You know the usual maint. and stuff. The car had 45,000 miles on it then. I gave $2,400 for it and what a steal. I have never had to do any thing but change the tires, muffler, and oil every 3000 miles. It now has 124,000 miles and doesn't use a drop of oil, and runs great. I live in Indiana so it is starting to rust some because of the salt they put down for the ice in the winter. I still just can't seem to let it go. 
I put a hitch on the car and it does really good pulling mylittle 12 foot fishing boat. You wouldn't think a little 4 cyclinder engine would pull much but it does a pretty good job.
This car has done everything I have asked of it and more than I expected it to do. I love it. 
We have taught 2 kid how to drive with it and that was good because it handles so nice. It was easy for them to control, and it's not one of the fastest cars in the world so they couldn't do to much hot rodding. They seemed to like it pretty good. 
This car takes me to and from work every day and to and from fishing and never any problems. Still runs great!!!
This car handles good, pretty good accerlation, and more power than you would think. It also comes with a very nice sounding stereo system. I would highly recommend this car to any one that wants anice little car to get around in. Not for the big family thats for sure. Gets about 28 miles to the gallon of gas on the highway and about 24 in town.<br><br>
