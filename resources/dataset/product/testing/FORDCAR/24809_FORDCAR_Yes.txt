            Ahh, the Ford Mustang.  It's been around for 35 years and I hope it lasts at least another 35.  For those of you who are looking for a fun, sporty and fast car that's LOADS of fun to drive, this is for you.  I personally have had one for the past seven years and would gladly buy another if my circumstances were different.  So let me give you a few pointers if you are considering one for yourself:

As far as options go, that's up to you.  All new Mustang convertibles have a glass rear window and rear defogger (which wasn't always offered.  Mustangs have had glass windows since the 1987 model I believe, but they didn't get rear defoggers until after 1994).  Glass rear windows are important; they won't crack, fade or turn yellow after a few years (unless someone abuses it).  Plastic rear windows will.  

Any convertible can leak.  Make sure you spray the roof around the windows and windshield area with a hose, then look inside the car for puddles or drips.  I was lucky with mine - it was raining when I went shopping, and a few Mustangs I looked at were dripping inside the car before I even took it for a test drive!  If you do find a leak, DON'T buy the car unless you want bigger, wetter headaches later.

Power windows are mostly standard on any Mustang convertible, as is power steering and brakes.

Cruise control is nice to have if you ever road trip or just have to drive on a highway for a while.

Automatic transmission is a good idea if you live in or near a big city, as using a clutch can be a pain in stop-and-go traffic.

A nice stereo system is important to many drivers, young and old.  Ford counts on that and offers an upgraded system, but I can tell you from personal experience that you can get just as nice a system (or better) for less at most car audio shops.  If you opt not to buy an aftermarket stereo, don't worry about it.  Stock car stereos have been pretty decent since the mid-80's, and they get better every year.

Any Mustang has decent power under the hood (I have the tickets to prove it!).  Traditionally, the Camaro or Firebird has always had more horsepower, but I personally like the rumble of a Mustang V8 over the others.  Mustangs sound like a sports car should, not just an overdone lawnmower engine.  Be advised, though, the 5.0 engine on older Mustangs (1987-1994) have a known problem:  The main engine seal can fail with as few as 50,000 miles.  So be wary of any Mustang 5.0 that seems like too good a deal for the price.

If you do decide to buy a Mustang convertible, here's my best advice to you:

Don't be impulsive (at least not entirely).  Have patience.  You're going to spend a lot of money on a Mustang (or pretty much any other car, for that matter), so DON'T settle for anything less than EXACTLY what you want, especially if it's brand new!  I knew what I wanted when I went shopping for mine, and it took less than a week to find it.  I even lucked out and found a better car than I had expected.

If you find the model, color and equipment you want, inquire about the car.  However, be careful about the salesman.  A good one will slickly try to talk you into putting money down if s/he can't get you to buy it on the spot, usually to &quot;be sure&quot; that the car is held for you.  Don't believe it.  The next person who walks in and signs the paperwork to purchase it will drive off with the car.  And although the dealership has to return your deposit, it's going to take a lot of time and effort to get it back.  The salesman will attempt to talk you into buying a different one instead.  Then you're back to square one. 

Price isn't everything.  Yeah, we all want the most for the least, but rest assured, you will get what you pay for if you're not careful!  Before buying one, make sure you've &quot;researched&quot; the car so you know the general price range for the car you want with the options you want.  Different equipment can drastically affect the price tag!

The truth is, if you find the car you want, check with the other local dealerships to make sure they don't also have the same car before you buy it (no Mustang is unique - there are many different combinations, but odds are several dealers will have the same exact car, especially if you're just a general shopper like most people).  You then have an advantage, because you won't have to settle for your first choice if you don't want to.

And finally, ALWAYS have a mechanic or someone you trust look at the car before you buy it.  They might see something wrong that you missed.<br><br>
