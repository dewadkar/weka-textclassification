            Before this car I was never an SUV person or even cared much about cars. They just got me from A to B. But something about this one made me fall in love with it. I bought my Escape XLT in February and have loved every minute of it. The handling is great, just like a car, so you can zip around, brake, and corner smoothly. The 200-hp engine gives you plenty of acceleration. but you still get the roominess of an SUV. There is plenty of cargo space once you fold the seats down, which by the way fold completely flat. The mechanism for folding them does seem a little flimsy to the touch, but I've had no problems. 

The interior on the XLT is great -- don't get the XLS. The arm rest hides a huge storage space, and there are plenty of nooks and crannies for stuff up front. I splurged on the leather seats, sunroof, and in-dash CD changer and I am so glad I did. The extras really make it more comfortable, and I am usually someone who likes to pinch pennies. If you are worried about wind noise, then don't get the sunroof. And have the dealer remove those ridiculous side-step bars (they are just bolted on). 

Some minuses: Gas mileage isn't that great (hey, it's an SUV), not really meant for off-roading (but I don't care, I live in the city), and some of the controls are a minor annoyance -- the gear shift gets in the way of the radio and rear defrost button, and the ignition switch is in an odd place on the steering column.

All in all I love this car. Before, my boyfriend and I used to argue over who had to drive. Now I always volunteer.
