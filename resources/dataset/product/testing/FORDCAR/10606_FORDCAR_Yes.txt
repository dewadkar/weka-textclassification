            I bought this truck because you get a lot for your buck, moving up from a compact car.
The first thing I noticed is that there seems to be plenty of room inside the cab. The controls are all within reach, and the instrument cluster is nicely laid out and clearly visible. The XLT Model is comfortable to drive, nicely styled with the flare side and supercab, and one tough little truck.
What I don't like about it is the fuel economy, and lack of power with the 3.0 Liter V6 engine.
This vehicle gets looks, it is one sharp looking truck, and fun to drive.
This truck should appeal to all people except those with special needs.
