            I looked at the 2000 Ford Focus in an effort to cut my monthly car payment.  I had previously owned one of the smaller SUV that I wasn't totally impressed with after a year.  I turned to the Ford Focus for several reasons.  The key one being that I wanted a smaller and safer car.  I test drove several of these cars over a period of about eight months.  I finally settled and found the perfect color and the right price.  A navy blue Ford Focus sedan SE.  (Hey, did I mention my payment dropped $100 a month?  Woohoo!)

What I love about this car compared to others in its class is the ease of which I can get my son in and out of his carseat.  I'm not sure what it is about other cars in this class, but I had a much harder time with the car seat situation. 

TRUNK SPACE!  Wow!  If you haven't ever glanced in a Focus's trunk, you won't beleive how much room there is in there!  I have more room in this trunk than I did in my SUV!  That's a great feature for a mom or anyone who likes to travel.  

Speaking of travel, I took this car on the road for 700 miles and it was very comfy.  All of my luggage fit into the trunk...and NO, I'm not a light packer!  My gas mileage consumption is superb and I love getting by with a $10 tank of gas at the pump!  Even with today's higher gas prices!

In short, there's nothing I've found to not like about this car.  I've had five cars...four new ones...in my life, and this car has earned the honor of &quot;the perfect car for me&quot;.

If you're looking for a compact car, I would recommend to look to the Ford Focus first.  Go ahead, shop around...but I can bet you'll at least look at it twice!<br><br>
