            In 1998 I bought a 1997 Contour. It was a previous rental, and I did not think there would be a big difference from buying new. It was a nice looking car and it had a lot of features in it such as power locks, tilt, and cruise. The car was wonderful for the first year that I had it, but then the big problems began.....

One day I started the car and smoke started pouring out from under the hood. An electrical harness had caught on fire. Apparently the harness was too close to the wiper motor, and they were rubbing. Or so I was told. (Gee, that same day the car was in the shop for a recall on the electrical system).

But wait, gets better...A week after I had my oil changed..all of my oil disappeared!!!! After spending almost a month going through oil consumption tests where I had to bring my car in every 3-5 days,it took Ford 3 weeks to figure out where my oil went. Then another week to replace the engine.

Well guess what.....to this day the car does not run correctly. I get surges as I drive on the highway and the car feels like it is going to stall out. But, don't you know &quot;there is nothing wrong with my car&quot;.

Needless to say.....my future purchases will not be Fords!!!!!<br><br>
