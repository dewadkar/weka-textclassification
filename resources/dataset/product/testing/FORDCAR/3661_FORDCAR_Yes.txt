            I am 21 years old.  I learned to drive on my parents' 1996 Crown Vic LX.  Not exactly the kind of car I expected to be in, but hey, who cares?

Needless to say, I was not too thrilled about driving around in a &quot;grandma car.&quot;  Man, was I surprised when I took the Vic out on my own for a test drive.  

The Vic really can move at high rates of speed.  Not to associate this car with recklessness, but I've had it going 105 up a pretty decent grade, and it still handled well.  The best part is that at high or low rates of speed, the car usually handles well.  I say usually because every once in a blue moon, the speed sensitive steering acts up and you will find yourself having to turn the wheel too little or too much to make a turn, but it is something that you can learn to live with.  One other problem that I have recently experienced is that when the engine enters higher revs, I hear this odd ticking sound.  I have no idea what it is, or if it is a problem, but it is irritating

I definitely found this to be a great car.  Not only does it handle well, but I have driven it for four hours without a stop.  The adjustable driver's seat really makes it easy to retain feeling in your butt.  Also, the back seat is roomy enough to sleep in.  My only complaint about the interior is that the radio console and a/c are just out of reach, even for a tall guy like me.<br><br>
