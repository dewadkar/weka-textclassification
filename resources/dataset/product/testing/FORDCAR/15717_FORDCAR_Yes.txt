                The ford windstar has to be the greatest minivan in the world. One day about 5 years ago I was driving my windstar and I was going around bell circle (revere MA) which is one of the most dangerous car rotarys in the country.
 I made a tun on a green light when a mack truck made a sharp turn and hit the side of my windstar. Surprisingly I was O.K. One reason is the great seat belt safety this van has. When I got out of the van to see the damage that was done.It turned out there was only a medium sized dent and no real heavy damage.
 I went to have the van fixed at the ford dealer. They said it would only cost about 600$. Unfortunately the service at the dealer was terrible and it took me two weeks to get my van back and fixed.
 The point is this van withstood a bad accident with fairy minor damage making it the safest vehicle I had ever seen in my whole life. I reccomend that everybody get a ford windstar. It will protect your family.Not to forget this is only a 1995 windstar and the new ones have improved in safety.So in conclusion the ford windstar is the best minivan you'll find.<br><br>
