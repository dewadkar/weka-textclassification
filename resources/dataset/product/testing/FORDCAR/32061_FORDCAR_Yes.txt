            When it was time for me to purchase this vehicle, I through out my past procedure for picking a truck.  My last truck was a 1988 Jeep Wagoneer.  It was so cool.  But it broke down and cost me so much money. 

For this vehicle, I did a ton of research.  I found that in 1995 Ford upgraded it's explorer and came out with a highly reliable car. Plus it had everything that I needed.

I found myself with a 1996 Ford Explore Eddie Bauer addition.  It is very nice and comfortable.  Everyone in the car gets a nice ride, even the dogs.  I have a sun roof that never leaks, an incredible stereo system with a 6 CD changer and a car that has only been in the shop 3 times in 3 years.  2 times for a regular check-up.  It's a very nice car.

But it doesn't have that SPARK.  There are 50 million of these cars on every block.  This car does not make you feel like you are the coolest thing on the road.  You are very safe on the road, but not all that cool.

Other cons - Cup holders inadequate.  Car phone in center council takes up too much room and is obsolete.  Older dogs have problems getting in the back because it is high off the ground (compared to jeeps.  Window on driver side has a slight whistle at high speeds.
