            I purchased my Contour in the Fall of 1998 shortly after the Mid Year model change.  I was looking for a sporty car that had both a V6 and a manual transmission.  I looked at used BMWs, a couple of used Nissan SE-Rs and a few Volkswagens.  I was under impressed with all of them especially for the asking price.  Then I started reading some reviews written about the Ford Contour.  They were truly glowing and chock full of praise.  I had to see why an American car of this price range was getting such accolades so I scheduled a test drive.  My first experience with a Contour was a 1998 SE Sport fully loaded.  It was a program car with 6,000 miles on it.  I pulled it out of the parking lot and was absolutely blown away.  I couldn�t believe that the engine was pulling all the way to redline.  THEN I tried some twisties. WOW I was in love.  I had to have it from just one drive.  Alas the Dealer wouldn�t deal with me SO I test drove another Contour from a different Dealer,  this time a 1998.5 SE Sport.  I bought that car on the spot.

After spending countless hours and logging 23,500 miles on my 1998.5 Contour I have to say I have nothing but praise for it.  I have had only one minor problem that required a visit to the shop.  It is relatively rattle free, and gets decent gas mileage, for a sport sedan.  The only problems I have with it are build quality, cheap plastic inside and the cup holders.   A few of the body panels don�t quite line up correctly, and there were some initial squeaks and rattles that I had to hunt down and tighten up some dash screws.  Ford fixed the post 1998 cup holder problem with a part that you can purchase for $10.00 at any dealer.  

Driving this car is an absolute blast.  The engine is willing and able to scream all the way up to its 6750 RPM red line, the brakes will haul it down quickly and let you tame all but the tightest hair pins.  I find myself seeking out longer and twistier roads to drive down simply for fun.  The stock springs and struts are fairly stiff but not so much as to hurt ride comfort.  This car is more fun than a 4 door should be.  The clutch engages at just the right spot, not too high not too low, and the shifter has a nice not too long throw to it.  Depending on the shape of the Transmission fluid the shift quality can be a bit notchy.  A change to either a synthetic fluid or Ford�s new MTX-75 fluid will change that.  Steering feel is precise and the beefy steering wheel communicates the road perfectly.    The Fully Independent Rear Suspension handles bumps in the middle of turns very well and also adds a bit of what Ford calls �Passive Rear Wheel Steering�.  That basically cancels out much of the understeer associated with Front Wheel Drive cars making this car very neutral handling and easily thrown into a four wheel drift.

The Ford Contour is going the way of the Edsel. Ford decided that this outstanding Global Car isn�t making enough money.   It truly is a shame for people seeking new cars that are both sporty and practical.  I am not talking sporty as in typical Pontiac throw up some cheap ribbed plastic and call it a sport car sporty, I truly mean SPORTY.  The V6 Contour can do  0-60 in 7 seconds and some change, has Great handling ability, is very agile  and possesses  wonderful road manners.  With a .8 g skid pad on stock tires (poor quality stock tires at that) this car is begging to be tossed hard into any and all corners.

The good news is for used car buyers.  Depreciation of the Contour is slightly above average so a person in the market for a sporty daily driver fully loaded can purchase a 1995 Contour SE for a little over $4K or a 1998 Contour SE for around $10K.  This car is made to be a great second family car if you have more than 1 child.  Or a wonderful Family car with one child.  The trunk space is fairly large and can hold a weekend�s worth of luggage, a stroller and baby stuff.  

If you are in the market for a Small Mid Sized car that is Fun and Practical the Ford Contour is for you.  This car stacks up well against the much pricier Audi A4, BMW 323i, And Volkswagen Golf Cars (Jetta, Golf, New Beetle).  It simply outshines all in its Price Class (GM Clones Grand Am, Alero, Skylark etc)  It handles well in all trim levels and is an exceptional value.   I have done just about everything a car can do with this Contour.  From a weekend Autocross to hauling pine bark to landscape the yard, long highway trips and short daily commutes.  This is the only car that I have ever driven that gives me a smile every time I crank up the engine and drive away!  If you don�t like a high Smiles Per Hour rate while driving avoid this car, it is much more fun than driving should be allowed to be!
