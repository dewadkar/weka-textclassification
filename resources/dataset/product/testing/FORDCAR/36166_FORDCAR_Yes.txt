            Honestly, I've had a lot of fun driving this car over the last year.  And minus one glaring glitch, I�d recommend it to anyone who, like me, digs an economical work commute.  Obviously the 2000 Focus ZX3 won�t compare well to a typical mid-sized car�s list of features, power, or dazzle, but for $14G it's not bad.  Not perfect, but not bad.

While it�s not the best economy car you can buy (more on that later), it's definitely interesting.  Its egg-shaped styling, sporty handling, ample space, and economical engine all rate positively with me.  On the other hand, the acceleration is drab next to its sporty demeanor.  The acceleration can be a real pain when merging into freeway traffic, and over the year it seems to have gotten slower.  Is it possible?  I think even my old 1996 Sentra was even more responsive.  And according to carpoint the ZX3 is rated with 135 lb-ft of Torque @ 4500 RPM?  Perhaps the automatic transmission is just inefficient.

When I rate this car I�m comparing it with other economy cars I�ve experienced in the past: a 1992 Geo Prism, a 1994 Dodge Neon, a 1996 Nissan Sentra, and a 2000 Nissan Sentra.  Of all these cars, the ZX3 easily ranks in the number two spot behind the 2000 Sentra.  So, overall it�s much cooler than your average economy car of past years, but like I said before, I can�t say it�s �the best�.  If you want a recommendation, try test-driving the 2000 Sentra instead.  I was simply amazed at what Nissan packed into the GXE model for only $15G.
