            Christmas was not very long and for my birthday I got a Ford Explorer.  When I first saw it I immeadiatly fell in love with it.  It is red and is a four by four.  It drives very smooth and is very comfortable as well.  The ford, to me, is probably the best looking brand of car.  Any explorer, no matter what year, always looks good.  However, I must suggest that if you are seriously thinking about buying an explorer, go with a 92 or 93 Eddie Bauer model.  Red and blue are the best looking colors.  The explorer has no downfalls and is great.  Please review my other opinions about cars and other items.

Thanks
