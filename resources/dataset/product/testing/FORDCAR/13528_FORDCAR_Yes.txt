            As a teenage driver, I was slightly apprehensive about driving such a large vehicle. I didn't think I would be able to handle such a large, massive SUV. However, I quickly grew accustomed to the height and power, and I can safely say that I love this car. 

I am 19 years old, and I have been driving a Ford Explorer for two years now. From the very beginning, I felt like I was driving a car. I never had any trouble with the height or the size. The Explorer is built in such a way that it takes up half the road, but is still versatile and surprising dexterity in its own way. 

One of the best attributes of the Explorer is that it is one of the safest SUV's, according to Consumer Reports (second only to the pricey Lincoln Navigator). It is the best SUV for side-on collision, and does well in front and rear. 

So far, I have had very little car trouble. The front grate began to fade from its jet black towards the end of the first year, but it still looks fine. Ford replaced it anyway, with no trouble (I recommend the warranty, it is completely worth it). 
The only problem I've had was that the back windshield wiper also stopped working. I now works some of the time, which is a little bit annoying. 

In regards to gas, it usually costs 24.00 to fill up (with regular), and I get at most about 330-350 miles for that. 

The seats are very comfortable, even in the back, where my 6' brother can sit easily. Being a college student now, I often fill my car with friends, and they always have plenty of room. I also used this car to move to and from college. The trunk is enormous, especially when the back seats are put down. I was able to fit a whole dorm room in this car! 

I have ridden in several other SUV's including the Blazer, Cherokee, and Tracker. The comfort and smooth ride of the Explorer blows the rest away. I did not feel as safe while in the other cars. 
The Explorer's height is a large bonus, and I find it hard to drive normal cars after riding in such a large one. 

Overall, I feel that the Ford Explorer is the most worthwhile SUV on the market today. It is a wonderful, safe, comfortable car with plenty of versatile room for transport. I plan on owning it until it dies, and afterward I may even buy a new one.
