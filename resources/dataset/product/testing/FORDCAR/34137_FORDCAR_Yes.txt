            In the early spring of 2001 my wife and I decided that a vintage muscle car was not a sensible choice of transportation anymore, at least as long as we were still going to college. I spent way too much time under the car and way too many tuition dollars went to parts and gas. We needed a car that was reliable and would haul our gear and buddies around in decent comfort and safety. I had had some good experiences with an �86 Grand Marquis that took me on a cross-country trip a couple years ago, so we agreed that an early nineties Crown Vic should meet our requirements nicely without breaking the bank.

We found our car, a �91, only a week or two after we actively started searching. Its first owner had fallen ill and wasn�t able to drive anymore. His son was able to present all the repair and maintenance bills from since the car had been new so we didn�t need long to make a decision. Ten months have passed since we purchased the car during which we put about 10.000 miles on the clock. Here�s the story.

When we got the car, the cruise control and the passenger side power door lock weren�t working. Since we live in Southern Cali we had the air conditioning refilled which set us back a hefty $250. -. I sometimes have the feeling that it could blow a little cooler, but it never takes longer than five to ten minutes to effectively cool at least the front of the passenger compartment, even in 100+ degree weather. The interior is spacious and the leather seats are comfortable and provide an outstanding lumbar support, which is nice if you have back problems or tend to get tired on long trips. Despite my 6�2�, head- and legroom have never been an issue in this car, even when I took the back seat. The most important controls are placed ergonomically and clearly visible on the dashboard, although some of my shorter friends do have to lean forward and reach over a bit in order to reach the heater controls due to the size of the car. I have never been convinced by the trend according to which a wealth of controls is incorporated into the turn signal lever, and that�s exactly where the wiper controls are on the Crown Vic. As a result, the lever feels bulky and somewhat flimsy, although I must admit that I haven�t had any problems with it so far (then again, I had to use the wipers only about three times since we bought the car). The ability to move my arms freely while I drive has always been a luxury that I�ve appreciated so I usually don�t let a third person sit in the front, but it�s nice to have that option.

The Crown Vic is supposed to be one of the safest cars around and given the abundance of sheet metal it�s wrapped up in I believe it. The interior is well padded with no sharp, protruding edges, the only potential hazard being the totally inadequate, on the rear seats completely absent, headrests. Even a mild crash will cause a nasty whiplash and chronic back pains that will likely last you a couple decades as a sweet reminder. The brakes, since we�re on the subject of safety, work very well overall but are susceptible to fading on extended downhill drives and have an occasional tendency to lock up pre-maturely, even when only moderate pressure is applied on the pedal. The ones on our car have also become a little grabby lately; new pads might be in order.

In the handling department, the Crown Vic is a pleasant surprise. It provides a reasonably smooth ride that will only be disrupted when crossing abrupt bumps, which can be encountered quite often here in downtown L.A. and will cause especially the rear suspension to kick back violently. When that happens in the middle of a curve, be prepared to suddenly have your rear-end relocated sideways by half a foot. Not a problem as long as it�s dry but watch out when it rains!

Picking up the pace a bit and trying to hustle the car through the canyons of the Santa Monica Traverse Ranges is actually more fun and less work than it might initially seem. Understeer is very moderate for a passenger car this size and after you�ve gotten used to the overly soft steering and the little feedback it provides you�ll be able to pick your turn-in points with surprising accuracy. Point and shoot. Put the gearshift lever in �Little D�, anticipate the downshift points of the automatic and use the throttle to balance the heavy Ford � fun. Even without the rear sway bar body roll is tolerable for a dinosaur like the Crown Vic, the key being a smidgen of extra smoothness in the transitions. Side-support of the seats is non-existent but then again, this boat was never intended to carve the canyons the way I like to do on occasion. And remember, the slower you are the faster you�ll be going. Don�t rush this baby, keep your cool, ignore the howling of your whitewalls, and you�ll be surprised how well she�ll keep up with the Hondas.

Now, what fun is canyon carving if you can�t power out of the turns? The 302V8 never seizes to amaze me, be it in my friend�s F150, in my other friend�s Cobra, or in my Crown Vic. Off the line, you don�t quite feel the punch this motor really packs due to the long gears and the size of the car but once you hit the open road, it hauls butt, alas at a price: gas consumption is down to 15mpg in the city and 20mpg on the freeway. However, that�s a small price I�m willing to pay for the kind of performance and reliability I�m getting � with 130.000 miles on the odometer, the engine pulls strong and doesn�t burn a bit of oil.

I�ve mentioned water a couple of times. Yes, it�s a problem. Off the line, the Crown Vic will ALWAYS spin the tires as long as it�s wet out, no matter how gently you treat the gas. In wet corners, be prepared for some sliding action � fun at times, but mostly annoying and downright dangerous in L.A. city traffic with a bunch of cars around you and drivers who are freaked out already just because of the fact that it rains. Luckily, the rear-end politely announces each slide and breaks out gradually, giving you ample time to react. Annoying nonetheless, I couldn�t imagine having to drive this car in the snow. I guess I�m just not adventurous enough for that kind of activity anymore.

Problems? Everybody who�s ever had a vintage muscle car as a daily driver will merrily laugh you in the face. No, the Crown Vic doesn�t create problems, at least not to the magnitude an older car does. So far the light in the glove box has gone out, the plastic grommet that connects the detent cable to the throttle body had to be replaced, and the passenger side power window has recently begun to act up. It works, but requires a little help from a gently pressing hand. Also, at 130.000 miles, the transmission seems to be on the downside of life � occasional shudders at the shift into overdrive indicate worn converter clutches, a problem I expect seriously having to take care of another half year down the line.

If you are looking for a luxury car but you�re on a budget, go for the Crown Vic. It�s comfy, reliable, safe, easy to handle and park despite its size, and so uncool it starts to be cool again. And, maybe most importantly if you�re spending a lot of time in traffic, it�s fun. There aren�t a lot of cars you can drive in L.A. traffic that are as relaxing as this one, especially at this price. Just give it a little shove with the throttle and let it coast down Sunset Boulevard all the way to the Ocean. If this one should fall apart another 100.000 miles from now and I still can't afford a German luxury car, I�ll buy another one. It's that good.
