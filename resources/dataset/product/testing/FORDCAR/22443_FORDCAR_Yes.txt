            Saturday, February 20, 1999 dawns bright and crisply cold at our home on the coast of Maine.  Six inches of new snow are on the ground, but the roads are clear.  I am in a particularly good mood.  Today is our 28th wedding anniversary.   I�m feeling pretty smug, since I�ve already presented my wife with her anniversary present � a beautiful antique corner shelf, originally made during the Civil War.  She�s pleased; I know this, because she�s spent her first three waking hours today arranging and rearranging an assortment of knick-knacks, potted plants, and various other decorations on it. 

Over morning coffee, I ask:  &quot;what do you think we oughtta do today?&quot;  &quot;Go look at cars,&quot; she responds laconically.  My immediate unspoken thought is: &quot;What?! An expensive Civil War-era antique corner shelf ain�t  enough?  You want a <i>car,</i> too?!&quot;

Actually, we�ve been talking about buying a second car for a few months now.  We recently bought a small house in the country, and it didn�t take long for us to figure out that two cars are essential.  My wife has already said she wants the second (as yet unpurchased) car.

Who am <i>I</i> to argue?  So, we pack our ten-year old son off to visit a friend and then pile into our trusty 1991 Honda Accord with 107,000 repair-free miles on it.  (That�s <i>another</i> review to write!)  First stop: our local friendly Ford dealer in Wiscasset, Maine.

We walk around their used car lot for about two hours, looking for that one car that really suits my wife�s fancy.  She sees a few, and I test drive them (She positively <i>hates</i> test driving cars).  Neither one of us can make up our mind.  When I return from the fifth test drive, I spy my wife standing next to a really clean looking, dark green 1997 Ford Ranger pick-up, with automatic transmission and a tonneau cover on the bed...

...&quot;You know, I was thinking,&quot; she says, &quot;Maybe <i>I</i> could have the Honda, and we could get a truck for <i>you.&quot;</i>

&quot;Hah! Twist <i>MY</i> arm!&quot; I think, grinning broadly.   We take the truck out for a spin and we both like it.   On the way back to the dealer, she says: &quot;Let�s see if we can get a better buy on a new truck.&quot;  <i>MORE</i> arm twisting!  We go to the new truck lot.  And there it is...a brand spanking new 1999 Ford Ranger, mid-Atlantic blue, gleaming brightly in the cold February sun.  Practically <i>pleading</i> with me to take it home...

...Truck and man bond almost immediately.

Well, we look around a bit, test drive a couple of other trucks, hem, haw, and generally make a pretense of not buying on impulse, but in the end, it comes down to Me And My Ranger.  To make a long story short, after closing a very VERY good deal, ($12,000.00, no money down,  0.9% financing over 4 years) I get to drive it home.

So what did I get for my money?   A brand new Ford Ranger XLT, with the following features:
� Bright Atlantic Blue exterior 
� Medium graphite gray interior with cloth bucket seats 
� 2.5 liter,  4-cylinder, 16-valve engine with electronic fuel injection 
� 5-speed manual overdrive transmission two- wheel  drive, rear wheels driven
� Regular cab and short bed
� Air conditioning; solar tint glass; spare tire lock; power steering/brakes; rear anti-lock brakes; digital AM/FM stereo cassette.

Nice list of features, you say;  but how do you <i>LIKE</i> it?  Well, now that I�ve driven it for over a year, I can state with confidence  that, despite a few drawbacks, it�s an excellent truck.  Here�s why:

� The engine is <i>VERY</i> fuel efficient;  Over a 15 month period, I�ve averaged about 27 MPG combined city and highway driving.  The engine is also somewhat under-powered, considering the 3,200 pound body (the <i>truck's</i>...not mine!) it has to push down the road.  Lack of power is especially noticeable on hills when in either 1st or 5th gear.  
� The 5-speed manual overdrive transmission is excellent, and an ideal match for the 4-cylinder engine.  Shifting and clutch actions are swift and sure, and the clutch, brake, and gas pedals are comfortably  positioned.  
� The truck handles very well indeed on almost all surfaces.  The suspension is stiffer than most compact pick-ups, so the ride is not quite as &quot;car-like,&quot; but since I�m not driving a car, that�s a good thing.  The power steering is responsive, with almost no play in the steering wheel.  Even on snowy and icy roads, the truck steers straight and true (as long as I stick to safe speeds. . . which I do.)  The power brakes are excellent, with no side-to-side pull at all.
� The cab is spacious, with excellent headroom and leg room (even for my 6�3&quot;, 240-pound frame.) I bought this truck with the regular cab, so I find that carrying extras - especially large items - is a problem in inclement weather. 
� Ergonomically, the cab is very well designed.  Controls are large, easy to see, and easy to reach.  The dashboard indicators are also large, attractive and easy to read.  The interior is whisper-quiet, even at highway speeds.  The cloth bucket seats are very comfortable and dirt resistant.  
� The environmental system (heater/defroster/air conditioner) is excellent.  The same holds true for the 4-speaker stereo AM-FM cassette player.  (I�ve since added a 6-CD changer, which also sounds superb.)
� Overall vehicle construction is of very high quality, with a solid, durable feel.  There are no squeaks, rattles or other annoying noises to contend with. 
� Over the long run, this truck has turned out to be very practical for my purposes.  It has been excellent for general cargo hauling, yard work, and other around-the-house chores.  I�ve found I don�t miss 4-wheel drive at all,  since I neither drive off-road nor use a snow plow. 
� Repair costs have been non-existent.  I�ve only experienced a couple of minor cosmetic glitches, both covered by warranty. 

The 1999 Ford Ranger has been a constant companion for 15 months now. I rely on it every day to get me to work and to keep things running smoothly around the ol� homestead. It's been an excellent vehicle in every way - quiet, comfortable, economical, useful, and a pleasure to drive.
