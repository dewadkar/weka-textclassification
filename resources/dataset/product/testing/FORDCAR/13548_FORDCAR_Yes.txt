            According to the National Safety Commission the Ford Explorer is in the top five safe Vehicles manufactured today. I have owned several for the past five years. Maintenance is almost none; simply the vehicle needs regular oil changes every 5,000 miles. I highly recommend this S.U.V for on road and off road. Contacting the Online National Safety Commission will also answer any FAQ you may have. This S.U.V is quiet riding has easy turning radius, and is so comfortable that you do not know you are on the road. The average price is $28,000 but worth the price. I bought my first in 1994 and have owned two more after that because I just wanted to upgrade to the next Years Explorer. I highly recommend that you test drive this S.U.V. at your earliest convenience.
