            My father purchased a 1996 Ford Explorer at the end of the model year, moving past the small station wagons that he had driven for years. The model he chose is pretty bare-bones--a two wheel drive XL four-door.  It came equipped with a five speed manual transmission, and doesn't even have a rear window defroster--so our Explorer is a true SUV--not a leather wrapped truck for the soccer mom set.

The base model has a powerful V-6 engine, and the manual transmission is the easiest I have ever driven.  The truck is rugged and durable--in the 82,000 miles it has been driven, it has needed nothing other than oil changes and tires.  

The interior is comfortable and practical, if a bit spartan.  There is plenty of room for five adults...and enough cargo space to hold a whole family's trappings for a week vacation.  The optional roof rack increases the amount of &quot;stuff&quot; you can take along.  

The negatives probably apply only to this stripped model, but here they are:  The interior is covered in low-buck butterscotch colored plastic, making it feel cheap.  It seems to lean excessively when cornering, and the rear wheel drive setup makes it prone to sliding on wet or icy roads. It also rides like a truck (well, more like a hay wagon) but I personally dont consider this a negative. 

Overall, the Explorer XL is an excellent value--roomy, dependable, and attractively priced.    <br><br>
