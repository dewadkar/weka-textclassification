            I received the vehicle for Christmas! What a surprise! The vehicle is beautiful! The Eddie Bauer version is loaded and luxurious. I love having the third row of seats, since I'm always carpooling! I can fit my three plus another three (sits eight in total but with passenger side airbags it isn't safe to sit children up front). All this, and I can even park it in a regular space. 

The drive is smooth and it can be steered with just the slightest touch. One of the features I love best is the &quot;miles left before empty.&quot; I never again have to guess how much further I can go once my fuel light goes on! 

The only negative the Expedition has is the lack of cargo space. The space between the last row of seats and the hatch JUST fits my compact stroller. To fit a load of groceries I have to push the last bench forward...which is fine unless there is someone sitting on it! Overall, for everyday, it's a great vehicle. For travelling with a big family, you may want to buy an overhead suitcase compartment.<br><br>
