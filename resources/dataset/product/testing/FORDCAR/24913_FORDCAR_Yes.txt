            Ms Rite, Happy to say, you are dead wrong.  The mustang may not ride like a caddillac, but it will out corner and out accelerate one anyday.  The mustang wasn't built to ride like a caddy, it was meant to do the latter as mentioned in the last sentence.

The Mustang does not sit that low, I have never bottomed out at any speed, even on speed bumps.  Just don't take them at more that 15 m.p.h.

Not nearly as bad as that neon I bought you.  Talk about riding low and bottoming out.  My god, I'm surprised the underside is still in tact.

As far as the snow, I don't drive my precious machine in the snow, do I?  that's why I bought that stinking neon, (it's not much of a loss if wrecked) that and I don't want our kids stinking MY car up with their puke and other bodily functions!

For the performance you get it's much worth a little sacrifice in ride quality.  Much better than the ride quality of that '93 Z28 I had the pleasure of beating the hell out of over a weekend when the dealership loned it to me before I bought the mustang.

As for the part you wrote about it not handling the road well.  The only reason you think that is because you are ignorant.  Ignorant because you have never driven it.  Maybe one day you will understand what all the hype is about IF I ever decide to let you drive my precious baby!
