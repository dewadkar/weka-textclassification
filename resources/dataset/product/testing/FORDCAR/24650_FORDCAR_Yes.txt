               We got this minivan because we had outgrown our car.  I hadn't wanted to get a minivan because I prefer to drive small cars.  But I LOVE my van, now.  It drives easily and is not that much different from driving my car. 

   Plus, we got the extended model so that we have room in the back for groceries and extras. We have to have lots of room because we have five kids and all of them always have to bring something along.  During the winter, when everyone has their coats with them, there is plenty of room to put them.  

   The only thing that I can complain about is that they don't make an 8 passenger Aerostar.  We are going to have to get something different when we have another baby and I am so happy with this van that I would probably get another one if they made an 8 seater.   <br><br>
