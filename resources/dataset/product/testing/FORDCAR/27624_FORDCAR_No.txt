            When I was in the market for a new SUV, the new 2001 models were just coming onto the market.  There are few things I love about this vehicle, although the things I do like are major.  The offroading abilities of this car are average.  It has front and rear independent suspension, allowing for a nice ride on the street, but sometimes not the best choice for offroading.  However, the car is short.  The negative thing about this is that it limits your cargo room, which I must say, is extremely limited.  The escape is almost undoubtedly safe, as Ford's reputation goes.  
       Now for the driving.  The Escape's steering is not quite that of a BMW, but its ok.  The pickup, however, is above average.  DO NOT BUY THE 4 CYLINDER ENGINE.  It is unbelievably slow, and it is pitiful that Ford would even try to get people to buy it.  The more fitting SUV for this size is the Mazda Tribute, the Escape's twin.  I prefer the tighter suspension, and quasi-nicer interior.  Consider it over the Escape.  In conclusion, the Escape is OK for a person on the market for the average in compact SUVs, and it is more of a car anyway.
