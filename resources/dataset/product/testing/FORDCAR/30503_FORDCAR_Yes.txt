            Ford crossed into new territory when it became the first automotive manufacturer to create a totally new chassis and body for its heavier duty trucks.  The risk was rewarding -- Ford's Super Duty series is all that it should be.  The trucks are big, tough, powerful, and durable.  The problematic transmissions of yesteryear have been replaced by top-of-the-line Allison transmissions.  The new transfer cases are also more durable.  The Super Duties are, however, subject to the inherent flaws of heavier duty pickups.

The Super Duties excel in terms of pulling power.  Ford offers different Super Duty suspension packages; you can get exactly what you need from F-250 through F-550.  The engines for the Super Duties are powerful.  The standard 5.4 liter v-8 provides ample power for most of us, with 245 hp and 345 ft/lbs of torque.  For those who need more, Ford has the answers.

The Triton v-10 provides 420 ft/lbs of torque -- powerful by any standards.  The v-10 will pull nearly anything.  It also provides that extra v-10 acceleration (rare in a fullsize pickup) while retaining acceptable fuel economy -- around 12 mpg.

The Power Stroke diesel engine gives you a ground-stomping 500 ft/lbs of torque.  What the v-10 won't pull the Power Stroke will.  The downside?  You lose the acceleration of the gasoline-powered v-10, though you gain a little ground in the fuel economy department.

The Super Duties lack in off-road prowess.  While their part-time 4wd systems are rugged, they are also simplistic.  Limited slip differentials are as high-tech as Ford will offer.  The full-time system that GMC offers is not available.  The trucks are heavy and have poor weight distribution -- as with all pickups, the weight is concentrated over the front wheels.  The turning radius is poor -- it is difficult to turn around if you end up in a tight spot.

The same long wheelbase that gives the trucks such a poor turning radius also provides a suprisingly smooth highway ride.  You'll never confuse a Super Duty with a BMW, but body roll is also suprisingly minimal.  For a heavier duty pickup, the Super Duties handle quite well, making the huge Super Duties fun to drive.  The feeling of power when you are behind the wheel is amazing!

The interior of the Super Duties is appealing and functional.  The gauges are easy to see; the climate/stereo controls are easy to operate.  Roomy?  I couldn't ask for more.  Of course, the back seat in the Supercab models is a little tight, but the Crew Cab back seats are as roomy as any vehicle on the market.

Nearly all pickup trucks on the road today represent a compromise, to some extent, between a road-worthy car and a load-worthy truck.  The Super Duty is a TRUCK -- it fills that role perfectly (hence 5 stars).  If you are looking for a smooth daily driver that you can park downtown, the Super Duty is not for you.  But if you want a real, hardcore, powerful pickup, the Super Duty is the ticket.  The Super Duty is great -- provided you want a TRUCK.
