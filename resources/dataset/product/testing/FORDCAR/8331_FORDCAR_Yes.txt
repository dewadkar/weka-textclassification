            I think everyone buys a Probe for its looks.  My 93 GT is a hot looking car.  But looks, unfortunately, are not everything.  However, I've had the car for only about 10K miles (grand total of 67K) and here's what I know: The day I picked it up, it completely died on the interstate for about 30 seconds.  No power, nothing.  I screamed, yelled, waited, and then it started right up.  After inspection by the dealer, nothing could be found. Since then, mechanically, it's great.  

I've had minor problems with quality:  Power antenna not very functional, driver side door panel is falling off, passenger side door doesn't close tightly (ever), windshield leaks a bit, side molding falling off, hatch can't stand open on its own, cassette player functions slowly.  But I'm glad that it runs well, considering the horror stories I've heard.  You can get a cheap deal on Probes, and they are good runners.  

Other complaints:  I'm 5'11&quot; and with the power moonroof, headroom is cramped.  The whole car is a bit cramped, actually.  Raves:  Decent power, good looking, mechanically reliable (knock, knock, knock).  This is my first &quot;Near Ford Experience&quot;, as my GM Loyal family has said, but the only thing I can really complain about are minor.<br><br>
