            My husband's dream was to have a truck that he alway wanted. He had bought me my car pontiac sunfire 1995 new, and now it was time for him to have his.

 We shopped  around and came to the Ford Dealer and in the show room there my husband saw this beautiful truck and was loaded to the gills, and then he said, &quot;that's the one&quot;. The salemen came to us and said,&quot; you want this one&quot;, and my husband said yes! Before you knew it we were test driving it and then the salemen said you can take it home and if you want it we can talk over the price and at this moment we said we will take it.

 The looks , different than the normal F-150 XL series custom. The truck has super large tires with mags that elevates the truck higher than the other truck of the series and adding the metal material covering to the back of the truck, and step side bars, front grill shield, and price was good of $32,000.00. 

This truck is great on the road  and gas is good by the mile. Smooth riding, and comfortable extend cab setting for 3 people also and a lot of room. Come in a lot  of colors, and we choose Marroon- Metallic. Its great for family of 5. I would recommend this f-150 serie truck to all my family and friend.<br><br>
