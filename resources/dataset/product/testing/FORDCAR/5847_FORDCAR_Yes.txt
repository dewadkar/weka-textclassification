            I am one of those minority auto control types. I like a stick. Just call me auto anal. So in my quest for a manual transmission, I ended with a Ford Taurus SHO. I did not think I wanted the power, my last Taurus was a 4 cylinder stick.

This car is different. Why does ford call it a Taurus? It is heavier, better riding, more comfortable, 15&quot; wheels, more sprightly and powerful. Yet gas mileage is good.

Watch out for repair costs. Compared to my old 4 cylinder Taurus, I get bill shock each time I had a comparable repair. Now that I have 130 some thousand on this guy, its starting to happen. I had 200 thou on that 4 cylinder I mentioned. Repair costs are at least 50% higher. Much of that is because the parts are not the same, much heavier. 

Who should or should not buy this car? I don't think one of these high testosterone ego types should. When I am challenged by these types, I don't try to beat them. I don't need to nor want to. But this car could and therefore would be dangerous in the hands of some idiot out to prove his manliness. But for reliable, comfortable driving with reserve power --- and manual control, its a fine auto.<br><br>
