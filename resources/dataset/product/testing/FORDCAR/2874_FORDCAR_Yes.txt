            I have owned a 1984 Ford Escort GL Wagon and a 1993 LX wagon.  I recently traded the '93 for a Toyota RAV4, but it gave us 120,000 miles of almost completely trouble free operation.  The only repairs made to the car was a new cigarette lighter and the replacement of a power window connection on the driver's side of the car.  At the time I traded the car in February, everything worked.  I had my '84 Escort for nine years and 114,000 miles. The original Escort was not as reliable as the second generation models, but the only repair was a replacement alternator when it was four years old.  Ford actually paid half the cost of replacing it, though the car was out warranty.

I will concentrate the rest of my review on the '93.  It was a green LX wagon with beige interior.  Rare for an Escort, it had power windows and door locks and premium sound system.  It stickered at $12,720, which was extremely reasonable.  The car's handling could best be described as okay in dry weather, and a little scary in wet or frozen conditions.  Brakes were adequate.  The ride was fairly good, the driving position excellent, and the controls were easy to use.  Build quality was great and no interior or exterior materials ever cracked, fell off or crumbled.  The paint held up extremely well.  It was a good, dependable ride, but it did not really excel in any areas.  And resale was abysmal.  I could only get $1,400.00 for it at trade in time.<br><br>
