            I owned a 96 Ford Explorer, then bought a 02 Explorer (Awesome Vehicle), but needed larger vehicle to pull new Hybrid camper.

Hello 03 Ford Expedition ! 

After about 8000 miles on my custom ordered 03 Expedition, I must say I am mostly happy with the vehicle. The Ride and handling for such a huge vehicle is amazing, like a 5000 pound vette, even when towing our 5000 LB Hybrid. The IND REAR SUSP really shines through on this vehicle. The 5.4 V8 is very smooth and has plenty of power for the job I am using it for, but lacks the horses of the larger GM engines. If only we could put the Chevy Duramax Diesel into the Expedition ! I did for the first time experience some door rattle in the drivers side door under certain highway conditions, but from other reviewers, might be a bulletin on this, almost like the top of the door was loose. I will get this checked and update.

Excessive break dust on the wheels is a pain too, especially the front, even after a short trip !

Gas mileage is about 16.0 MPG HWY and 12 City, towing about 11 MPG. I knew this when I bought it so this is not an issue, although improvement would be great.

The DVD ENT system keeps the kids quiet during trips and with headsets, they can watch movies while we listen to CD's or the radio. The 3rd row seat is roomy and has seating for 3 and all seats have shoulder harnesses.

This vehicle is great for those long trips, we completed a 2100 mile trip recently and found the large cabin space
to be a real asset. The vehicle was really comfortable to drive, and the passengers never complained once.

My only real problem, I purchased a Ford supplied bug defector with the vehicle and at above 50 MPH in certain wind conditions, more times than not, it sounds like your driving in a hail storm as the wind is improperly deflected onto the windshield. Fords solution which I think is crappy, to remove the shield. It's their shield, it should work. I left it on and just tolerate the noise for now.

The large mirrors are great for towing, but makes for a tight fit going in and out of the garage. The supplied Con Trac tires performed bad in 2 panic stops for Deer, almost like driving in snow on dry pavement so I swapped them out with some GoodYears after 800 miles, braking was really enhanced after this. TIRES DO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, but it still doesn't stop as quick as the 02 Explorer. 

The vehicle has been in for service once, door adjustments, hatch leak and Bug shield noise with noise still not resolved except for taking off the shield and letting the bugs chew up the front of the hood.

Overall, I am very happy with this vehicle. I do have a car to drive locally, If I only had 1 vehicle I would have kept the V6 explorer as the Huge Expedition is not great as an every day vehicle especially trying to get into parking garages or passing gas stations.

UPDATE: AFTER 13000 MILES, THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE, AND A CRAZY ONE AT THAT.

SEEMS FORD DIDN'T PROPERLY SHIELD THE ELECTRONICS IN THE 03 EXPEDITION AND CERTAIN ELECTRONIC SIGNALS, MILITARY AIRCRAFT DOPPLER RADAR AND WEATHER RADAR WILL CAUSE THE GAUGES TO SWEEP, A/C TO QUIT, WARNING LIGHT TO ALL GO ON, DOORS UNLOCK, DVD AND RADIO TO SHUT OFF. THIS ONLY LASTS A COUPLE OF SECONDS, BUT THE A/C MAY NOT WORK TILL THE VEHICLE IS SHUT OFF FOR QUITE SOME TIME, THE MESSAGE CENTER SCRAMBLED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE OF THIS. IT IS ANNOYING AT THE LEAST. FORD SAYS THEY ARE REDESIGNING THE INSTRUMENTS AND WILL FIX IT, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN !

I LIKE THE VEHICLE BUT THIS IS NOT GOOD !!!!!!!!!!!!!
