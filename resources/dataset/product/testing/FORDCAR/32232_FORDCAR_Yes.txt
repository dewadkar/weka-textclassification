            I've driven many different kinds of cars.  My Ford F-150 is the first car I've owned.  It's almost a shame, as it has now spoiled me for all other cars.  There are a slew of good things about this truck, and most of the bad ones are common to all trucks.

Every car has some unfortunate design specifications. The F-150 is not exempt.  The sound system in this truck is nothing to write home about.  While the original radio is an acceptable AM/FM cassette, I put in a CD player and am now very pleased with its performance.  There are seatbelts for three in my truck.  I've had four in the cab for a short distance.  Of course, one can toss a dozen or so in the back.  However, if you're trying to carry lots of passengers (not cargo), don't pick this truck.

Certain features of this truck stand out as exceptional.  I've gone 7000 miles in nine months and haven't had to take it in for anything.  The truck now has over 65,000 miles on it, and according to its log it's never been in for anything other than regularly scheduled maintenance.  I've changed its oil and oil filter without any trouble, and the spare tire was easy to put on when I did have a flat.  Every time I help friends change apartments I am always amazed at how much stuff I can fit in the back.  The truck sits up fairly high, but if you butt it against the curb it's easy to get everything in it you want to.  I can see my pickup across an entire parking lot.  It is tall and bright blue.  Even in a pickup heavy state like Texas I've only seen one truck of similar color and size in nine months.

There are certain things you should expect from any pickup.  It is a big car, and you don't want to forget that.  The single blind spot I have some trouble with is the one behind the driver�s left shoulder.  A glance back can sometimes miss little cars right next to you, but by leaning forward a bit they can be picked up easily.  I get sixteen mpg.  It's not a good number for a car, but from what I've heard and seen it's very good for a 4WD pickup.  My pickup has a very large turning radius.  That's good and bad.  The bad news is that I have a tough time pulling headfirst into parking spots.  The good news is I've gotten very good at backing into them.  Watch out for curbs on tight turns.

I plan on keeping this truck for a number of years.  I haven�t had any problems with it, knock on wood, and am very pleased with its performance.  Until I need more passenger space or gas shoots up in price astronomically I can�t see any reason for a different vehicle.
