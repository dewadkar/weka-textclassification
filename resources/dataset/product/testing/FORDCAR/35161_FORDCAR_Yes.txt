            In June '99, I set out to buy my first car.  Ahhh, the daunting task ahead of me.  As I drove down Auto Row, I stopped at lot after lot looking for the &quot;perfect&quot; car.  As I came to the final dealership, Ford, I shuddered.  I pictured a box-style car with bad design and no class.  Was I ever surprised!  I told the salesman that I was interested in a two-door (which happens to be VERY hard to find these days), sporty, economical car.  When he recommended an Escort, I cringed.  But when he brought me up to a white ZX2, I was in love.  This car is not anything like I had imagined.  The design was sleek and had a spoiler on the back.  The interior was roomy, but gave me that feeling of comfort.  The gas mileage was excellent, both city and highway driving.  And the best part of all- the price!!!  Through a special weekend sale- I drove away with my new little car and only paid around $13,000 (and that's including the financing fees).  I put $2,000 down and my monthly bill is about $215.00.  As I said, very economical these days.  So if you are looking for a great car for a great price- a Ford Escort ZX2 may be the car for you!!!! <br><br>
