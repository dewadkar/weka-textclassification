            I recently had the pleasure of driving this vehicle which is the newest addition to the Ford pickup line and I must say that I was impressed.  I am an auto broker so I deal with vehicles all day long and Ford Super Duty trucks are my specialty.  I picked this truck up and drove it 100 miles to the auction in Tampa Florida and was quite surprised by the feel of it.  The F-150 sits very comfortably especially compared to the F-250 or F-350.  The F-150 offers a smooth ride with very little road noise, and a passenger area loaded with all of the creature comforts you would expect from Ford.

On the other hand, if you are looking to tow anything substainal you might want to shy away from this truck, it isn't built for it.  The payload on this truck is quite alot less than an F-250 and slightly less than a regular F-150.  I also recommend that you opt for the upgraded engine which is the 5.4 litre, the standard 4.6 litre, though peppy in a mustang, doesn't offer the kind of acceleration you need in a truck this size.

All in all the 2001 Super crew is a great truck for your family and the next step in the world of trucks.
