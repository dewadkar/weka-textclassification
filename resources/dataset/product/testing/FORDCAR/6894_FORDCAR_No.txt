            I have a 96 F 350 4x4 with 351 eng. and C6 Trans. In 17000 miles I have lost both exhaust manifolds due to leakage. The transmission went out,a spark plug rusted into the head and broke off,the calipars have stuck causing poor braking the paint,white vehicle,developes small rust spots on it and mileage is 10 mph at best.The service writer at ford told me that ford has had a problem for years with exhaust manifolds,especially on 351 eng.,her own mid 90s ford developed the same rust problems.When I bought the truck I told salesman I was going to use it as a tow vehicle. I tow a 3500lb trailer and this eng.trans combination with 4.10 gears has all it can handle. Ford must be doing better with the newer super duties. On yah I was told by the dealer that ford has now fixed the premature problems with exhaust manifolds,they do not use that eng. anymore. Good fix? <br><br>
