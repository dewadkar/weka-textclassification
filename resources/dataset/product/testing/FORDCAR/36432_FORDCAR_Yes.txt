            I just traded-in my Ford Probe GT, auto. Coupe about a month ago. It bought it at 91,500 mi. and traded it at 129,000 mi. During the 37,500 miles and 2.5 years that I had this car, it was an absolute pleasure to drive. I only hope my new cars are as good as this car was.

PROS: 
-This car war extremely reliable.
-It had very comfortable front seats and the gauges were easy to read.
-The car was pretty fast (125 mph easy)!
-It was the best car I ever owned.
-Good looking design.

CONS:
-Good amount of road noise at highway speeds.
-Virtually no back seat room. In fact, you can really only have two people in there comfortably on a long trip. If an adult sits in the back, you have to drape you legs across the other side.
-All the parts that Ford recommends are incredibly expensive. The tires which are VR-rated cost about $160 each. The alloy wheels run $300 each. The fog lamp broke and they wanted $150 for one fog-lamp.

***The car is vulnerable to theft because thieves can pull the window out a little bit and pop the lock up(the window doesn't go into the frame).***  

Overall, in owning this car I had to do the following: I had a leaky brake caliper seal. Firestone (Expert Tire) lied and told me that this would cost $815 to fix because you need to fix both calipers at the same time. This wasn't true, So I replace both rear calipers (even though I didn't need to), four new rotors, and front brake pads myself for about $250. The only other repair was to the front right CV Axle for about $130. Otherwise no other repairs were made. Although, when I traded it in they told me that the water pump was leaking and I was overdue for a timing belt.
    I took this car from where I was stationed in Oklahoma to Washington State (back and forth 4000 miles) 4 times when my mother was sick. I never had a problem. In fact, when I bought a 2000 Dodge Intrepid I took the Probe because it was more reliable.
