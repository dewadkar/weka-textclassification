            my dad owns a 91 ford bronco and it gives nothing but problems.  don't get me wrong, i love this truck but with a little less problems it would be on top.  the electronics are the main problem.  the factory deck crapped out after a couple of years.  first the display wouldn't work and soon after it wouldn't play tapes at all.  next the window motors went.  i guess that in time they are supposed to give way but i have replaced them three times already.  replacing these motors is a fairly easy task but requires two 1/2 inch holes to be drilled in each door to gain access to two of the three bolts.  the steering gets thrown off fairly easily.  this is a problem that i have noticed in ford trucks.  i owned a ranger and had this same problem.  when i say thrown off i mean that the steering wheel feels loose, like it can move a bit to the left and right without it feeling like the wheels are turning.  we don't do any major off-roading with this truck either.  however this problem can be fixed with a simple wheel alignment.  the brakes were the next thing to go.  at first i thought that the master cylinder just needed to be replaced.  the brake pedal did feel better after this was done but still didn't feel quite right.  when we took it in to the mechanic he said that the calipers needed to be replaced.  don't no why this was because we haven't slammed on the brakes before they were replaced.  the largest problem that we had is the engine.  it burns a lot of oil.  there are many possible problems like dropping a ring or losing a, for lack of better terminology i'll call it a retaining ring on the valve.  this occurred before there was 85k on the odometer.  no we don't do much traveling with it, it is mainly to get around town.  my friend's dad also had a similar problem with his 92 f150.  that f150 needed a rebuild well before 40k.  that engine could have possibly been a lemon but who's to say.  again don't get me wrong about ford trucks, i love them but they come with their problems.<br><br>
