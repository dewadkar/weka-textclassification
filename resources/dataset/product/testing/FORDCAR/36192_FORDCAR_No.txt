            The Ford Focus has a very good ride for a small car. It is a much softer and comfortable ride than the bumpy ride typical of many small cars.

The car was also easy to stear and the automatic transmission ran fine.

The Ford Focus also has a nice sounding stereo for an inexpensive car and included a cassette player something many small cars do not.

The car is set up pretty well also (easy to see out of and buttons and knobs easy to reach.)

A big issue with Ford cars however is how well they keep their value and the frequency and price of repairs. Fords in the past have not held their value as well as other cars and have needed more repairs and repairs which are proportionately more expensive than others. For example the Escort which this car is replacing required the replacement of a whole light set for $80 when the outside plastic cover which should have cost $5 to replace broke. The light set did not allow for the replacement of the plastic cover alone. I do not know if the Focus is similarly built.

One major problem with the Focus was the replacement of a lost key. Ford was unable to replace the key and said that it would take several days to get to it and they wanted $300.00 to replace a lost key. <br><br>
