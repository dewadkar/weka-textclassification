            After years of driving my Geo Metro and my husbands Chevrolet Cavalier, my husband and I decided that a new car purchase was in order. Don't get me wrong here, the Geo Metro has been a pretty reliable little car, and the Chevrolet Cavalier has endured many a mile down the Houston highways, however, when the Geo Metro's air conditioner broke and we were told by 3 mechanics that it would be at least $600 to replace the compressor...we knew that the Geo Metro would have to retire. Afterall, we live in Houston where air conditioning is NOT an option, but more of a necessity!! 

So, we set out to find the best new car we could find for our small wallets. My husband and I test drove the Kia Rio, The Kia Sephia, and Toyota Echo. We found all of these cars nice, but not nice enough to commit to a purchase. Especially the Kia Rio. WHAT A TINY CAR!!! The warranty may be nice, but after 6 years of enduring the Geo Metro and it's small size, we weren't about to go down that road again! Next we test drove the 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier, The Hyundai Accent and The Dodge Neon. As much as we like the chevrolet cavalier, we already owned one and were looking for a change. We did like both the Hyundai Accent and the Dodge Neon however, and had actually narrowed it down to choosing one of the two, when my mother (who works at a Ford Dealership as a customer service representative)seemed almost offended that we hadn't even tried out the Ford Focus. "Everyone loves their Focus!!!" she exclaimed. "We've gotten alot of complaints about alot of things, but the Focus rarely gets a complaint...you should at least test drive one!!" My husband and I agreed, and decided that we should at least take one for a spin. Afterall,what harm could it hurt??

My husband and I arrived at a Ford Dealership to realize that the Focus comes in many flavors...stationwagon, 4 door sedan, 4 door hatchback(zx5), and 2 door hatchback(zx3). We decided to test drive the 4 door sedan, when the 2 door hatchback (zx3) suddenly caught my husband's eye. 
"Oh NO you don't!!" I exclaimed. "I've endured that damn Geo Metro for 7 years, and I'm not about to go back to a tiny hatchback again!! I want to test drive the 4 door!". 
"Wait a minute" he said. "The 2 door isn't that small, and look...it even has a CD player". 
O.k....I'll admit it...the CD player interested me. My husband and I own 5,000 CD's and neither the Geo nor the Cavalier had a CD player installed. It would be nice to listen to our CD's in the car, and hey...the 4 door sedan didn't have a CD player in it!!!
"o.k" I mumbled..."We'll test drive both and see just how small this hatchback really is compared to the 4 door".

The Ford Focus is not your average looking car. With a European design, it not only stands out from the crowd on it's looks, but on it's comfort and driving as well. Immedietly upon sitting in the the Ford Focus, my husband and I could tell that this car was different from the rest of the cars we test-drove. The seats sit higher up, leaving you with a feeling that you are sitting higher than most of the other cars on the road. With 3 extra inches of headroom from most other cars, there is plenty of head room for even the tallest of drivers and passengers. Both the 4 door sedan and the ZX3 are VERY roomy for their size, and both my husband and I were amazed at how much room there actually is in both cars. Heck,even the console and dash are positioned perfectly, with the radio higher than the air-conditioning system for those of us who fiddle with the radio more than the temperature controls, and the Focus just glides down the highway as if it were a luxury car and not an economy car!! What can I say....THE FOCUS IS A DREAM!!!!!! 
After having test drove both the 4 door sedan and the ZX3, we decided that we HAD to have a Focus, and ultimately decided on the ZX3 for it's added features and 15 inch wheels.  

I can honestly say that after having test drove most of the economy cars out on the market, that the Ford Focus is hands down, one of the best cars out there. My husband and I are completely in love with our Focus, and love to take friends and family for rides around the block. My father-in-law loved our Focus so much, he went out and bought one himself!! Now if that doesn't scream great car, I don't know what does!!
