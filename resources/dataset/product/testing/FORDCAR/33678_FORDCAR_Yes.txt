            I was originally looking for a Honda and willing to pay the extra thousands of dollars,I saved when I purchased my Ford Escort ZX2.
Starting college in Sept.I'll have enough expenses without spending a lot on a car. I didn't even know what a Ford Escort was and when I was looking for cars, It caught my eye. It's good on gas and has the power to get up and go. I wish it had a little more leg room in the back for passengers but as the driver I don't have any complaints. 
I drove a Toyota Camry prior to my escort and I don't feel any difference in the way it handles. I basically will use my car to commute to school.
Anyone looking for a economical car should check out the ZX2, You'll be surprised it's a Ford Escort. Excellent for moms with small children since it is a two door. Being a two door it is a little difficult for larger people to get in and out of the back as any two door might be. <br><br>
