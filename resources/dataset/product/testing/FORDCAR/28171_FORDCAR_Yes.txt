            <b>My</b> Light Evergreen 1995 Taurus was in the Bargain News, a Connecticut-based publication known for many years for its used car listings, for $3,500, in August 2000.  There were 126,000 miles on the clock but most of them seemed to be highway miles put on during a long commute.  It turned out to have broken motor mounts, (an especially ornerous repair on a Taurus) but was in good shape otherwise, and ran smoothly and quietly.  I bought it for $1600, replaced the motor and transmission mounts, performed basic maintenance and a transmission service (essential insurance for any Taurus owner) and it was good to go.

<b>And</b> go it does.  This car has the optional 3.8 liter V6, an engine that was something to avoid a few years ago.  In this case the owner showed me documentation that all of the correct Ford updates were performed, including the <b>extremely important head gasket upgrade</b>, so I wasn�t too concerned about durability.  The 3.8, with 26% more displacement than the standard Vulcan 3.0, changes the Ford�s performance from acceptable to brisk.  0-60 acceleration is improved by about a full second, and there is torque to spare, making highway cruising a real pleasure since you aren�t constantly downshifting to maintain speed on hills.  The standard 3.0 Vulcan does a reasonably good job at this too, for it�s size, but, as the saying goes, �There�s no replacement for displacement�.  The 3.8 surprised me by burning no more fuel than my 1987 3.0 equipped Taurus (see my Eopinions review), and was at all times very quiet and smooth.  

<b>Although</b> this is a base model Taurus, the level of content was a pleasant surprise.  Excellent air conditioning, power windows, locks, mirrors, and driver�s seat, tilt wheel, cruise control, remote trunk and fuel filler door release, courtesy lights everywhere, front and rear center armrests, fully aluminized exhaust system (you never see these cars in a muffler shop) , alloy wheels, and even 4-wheel disc brakes were all present.   The 4-wheel discs are excellent, dragging the big Taurus down from speed very quickly and with surprisingly little effort.  They are hard to find on Tauruses of any year, but if you do run across a used example so equipped, you should consider it a real plus.   

<b>Ride</b> and handling are what you would probably expect from a big Ford;  soft, comfortable ride and easy handling with numb power steering and lots of understeer.  Quiet and comfort are the dominant factors and aggressive cornering definitely takes a back seat.  The 1995 is the second generation Taurus, and it differs in this area from the 1987 (first generation) I owned previously.  The 95 suspension has a bit more �float� than did the 87, which was a bit tighter and seemed to offer slightly better control.  I would guess that the 87 was probably lighter in weight as well.  Also, the 95 suffers from more squeaks and rattles, because its interior is comprised of many small panels (especially around the dashboard) which all fit into one another, and all of those surfaces rubbing together produce unwanted noise.  Like the 87, this Taurus seats five adults in reasonable comfort, four if you want everyone to have plenty of room.   

<b>Remember</b> to have a qualified mechanic check out any prospective Taurus purchase beforehand!
