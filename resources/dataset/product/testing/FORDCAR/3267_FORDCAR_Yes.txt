            Our F-150 is a Red with Silver bottom, XLT Super Cab 4X4 with the 5.4 V8, Off road and Towing packages, Go Rhino Brush guard, Nerf Bars, Lighted Visor, Bed liner, and caps. We were also lucky to get all the interior goodies including the hidden 6 disk CD changer and overhead console. 

Gas mileage:

Through out the summer we were able to get 16mpg with or without the Air on and since winter time it dropped between 14.5 and 15.5 mpg in 2wd or 4wd. I have been very impressed with the fact that no matter what we do other then towing the mpg rarely move unless you really get on it for fun.

Engine:

This truck has some serious power! I had to haul a parts car from my Mom�s to my house 3 weeks ago and on the way back I had my 700lb Polaris Sportsman in the back and was pulling the car on a large Auto Transport from UHaul. I came up on a very slow driver and when I needed to pass him I could barely tell I had any weight behind me. As soon as I hit the gas I was gone. The only thing I felt was the play in the receiver hitch, other then that it was as responsive as it is empty.

Interior and Family stuff:

One of my favorite things about this truck is when it comes to kids it has a rear door on both sides! I never have to walk around the truck if I don�t want to. Plus it had a switch to shut off the passenger Air Bag if you want one of your kids up front. There is so much room in the cab I can even stop at Wal-Mart or the grocery store after a trip to Menards! J I really like the Drivers side grab handle they added in 2000 along with the overhead console with built in temp gauge and compass. I just wish they added a trip computer to calculate mileage and other information.

Brakes:

I was very impressed when I saw that this pickup came with 4 wheel antilock disk brakes all the way around. I was under it changing the oil and also noticed that it comes with multi piston calipers for more stopping power! All this on a truck really surprised me and I had to avoid looking at the rear drums on our 97 Accord.

Drivability:

We took this truck on a trip to Wausau this summer for my Cousin�s wedding. This is a 3 to 3.5 hour trip from our house so it was a good test for traveling. The ride was very comfortable and my back never ached. (back almost always hurts since I was in a car accident 5 years ago) The cruise only fluctuates 1 or 2 MPH on the big hills where it down shifted to hold the speed. I have driven many vehicles long distances and my pet peeve is when a vehicles cruise control can�t hold the speed limit!  Speaking of cruise controls, this is one of those where if you have it already set, it will increase 1 MPG for every press of the Accel button and decrease 1 MPH for every press of the Coast button. I go from a 55MPH zone to a 65 MPH zone hit the Accel button 10 times and it speeds up to where I want it. This is my favorite type of cruise set up!! 

Some days on my way to work I feel like I�m gliding down the road but you will notice the cracks in the roads if your trying to feel them and can easily ignore them. You do have to remember it is a truck so it does have stiffer suspension then lets say a Cadillac but it excellent for a truck!! 

At this time I do not hear any rattles or feel any shakes while driving.

This is a beautiful truck and is always followed by compliments even by some Chevy and Dodge guys!

 

It is still a toss up which vehicle we like better between our F-150 or our Accord. As far as this truck goes I haven�t found anything I don�t like other then the mileage but then again it is a truck.
