            I moved to Los Angeles from New York three months ago.  After spending more than two months with my brother shuttling me around town (hard to live like that in LA), I opted to purchase a Ford Explorer Sport.  

Buying in August as dealers begin selling the 2000 models, I was able to negotiate a price at invoice.  I also benefited from a $500 rebate and .9% financing for three years.

I purchased the vehicle because of its general utility.  As a 6'5 270# guy, the interior dimensions of the Explorer were very appealing.  The ergonomics were superior to those of the Cherokee.  

I recommend the upgrade to the SOHC cam engine if the automatic transmission is chosen.

The 80 watt sound system is great to all but the most discerning audiophile.

Beware of the flare fenders.  I liked the looks of them at first.  After a while, however, they started to look cheap and toy-like to me.

Happy trails.<br><br>
