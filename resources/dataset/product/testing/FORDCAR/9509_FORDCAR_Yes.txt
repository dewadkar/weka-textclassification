            My dream car, I finally own it! I swear I was having dreams about this car for weeks. It all started when my husband went to the Ford dealer and bought a new truck last month. I went with him to pick it up, and that is when I saw it. A laser red metallic<b> 95 Mustang GT.</b>

I had owned my Grand Am for 6 years, and it was time for another car. We were going to wait a few months before looking again, but I really loved this car. We decided to check around at other dealers first, and also check on insurance for it. We did look at many different <b> Mustangs</b>, but none that I liked as well as this one. The insurance for a <b>Mustang</b> is on the high side, but they are rated a number 6 on a scale of 1-10 (10 being highest to insure).

So after looking at other <b> Mustangs</b>, we bought the<b> 95 GT</b>. I love how this car drives. The features it includes are:

<b>* 5.0 V-8 engine
* driver and passenger air bags
* power rack and pinion steering
* anti lock brakes
* remote keyless entry
* tinted glass
* dual power windows and door locks
* power side mirrors
* sport tuned dual exhaust
* tilt wheel
* mach 460 AM/FM cassette
* interval wipers
* fog lights
* cruise control
* air conditioning
* illuminated entry
* traction-lock axle
* rear window defroster
* sport seats with power lumbar support
* 4-way power driver's seat
* cargo tie down net in trunk </b>

It is also in like new condition, with 40,000 miles on it. We bought this with the extended 2 year warranty, and if is anything like our many other Fords that we have owned, we won't have to use it. 

The disadvantages to the car is that it doesn't get great gas mileage (but not too bad for a big engine). The gas mileage listed for it is 17 city driving and 25 on the highway. The back seat is also not made for tall adults. We have 2 small children, so that isn't a problem for us. It only has one drink holder also, and I am really missing the three I had in my previous car. It is also a rear wheel drive, but the 5.0 models come with a traction lock axle. I am hoping this will be a good feature for winter driving. 

So far, I am very impressed with this car. I hope it doesn't disappoint me. <br><br>
