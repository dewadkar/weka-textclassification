            I ordered the 1999 35th edition Ford Mustang as soon as I could after seeing pictues of what this car would look like.  I owned an '94 Mustang at the time which was the 30th anniversary edition and I truly loved.  It seems Ford keeps getting better every time it redesigns the 'stang.  This is the 5th Mustang I've owned and I'll continue to buy them as long as they are being made.  It is a great, head turning sports car which is very reasonably priced for the middle class person.  The car has plenty of power and gets great gas mileage.  I upgraded to the Mach 460 stereo system on both the &quot;94 and &quot;99 models and would never settle for a regular stereo again.  I could just get in my Rio Red Mustang and ride around for hours listening to the great sounds.  The only problem that I could find with the Mustang is that there is minimal leg room which isn't a problem for me as I'm short but could present one to a tall person.  The seats tend to become uncomfortable if you are taking a long road trip so be sure to plan your trip accordingly.  Go test drive one of these babies and see if you don't want to just Ride, Sally ride!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
