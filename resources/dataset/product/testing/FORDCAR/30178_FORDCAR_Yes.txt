            This was my first new car after graduating with my master's degree 2 years ago.  I wanted an SUV and checked out almost all of the models available.  At first I had my heart set on a Tahoe, but after some consideration, I decided that I did not need the extra size and power and certainly didn't need the extra cost.
Ford Escape was my favorite mini-SUV from the start.  First, the price is right for a 4 wheel drive vehicle.  I think the interior is roomy and has about as much space as a regular car but with the difference that you can put the seats in the back down to handle larger items that wouldn't fit in a standard car trunk.
I ordered the top trim model.  The moon roof is as good as any on the market.  The MACH stereo is good, but it's not the best I've seen.  Speakers are very good.  The seats are OK but not extremely comfortable.  I think that the leather on the seats is kind of cheap.  I like the space available in the console and the drink holders are well designed.  There is also somewhere to dump change which is handy for my quarters, nickels, dimes, etc.  I love the way is handles and find it quite "zippy."  I have already received one speeding ticket!
The cruise control buttons are on the steering wheel which is OK but they don't light up at night.  Also most of the window buttons and door lock buttons also do not light up at night.  My last complaint is that there is no way to turn on the dome light - you have to individually click the light buttons which can be a pain.
