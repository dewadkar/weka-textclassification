            I know, I know. The Escort isn't the most glamorous car out there. I, however, love my 1998 Escort ZX2, and I'll tell you why in a minute.

First, I should mention I've owned three Escorts and have had just about no trouble with them. I started with a 1993 &quot;plain Jane&quot; Escort that held up admirably for years. I then purchased a 1995 Escort GT for my wife, and she loved the thing. After my wife and I divorced and I wrapped by Ford Contour around a tree, I purchased my ZX2. At the time, I figured, &quot;Well, I've got no wife. I've got no kids. So this little two-door jobby should work out fine.&quot;

The best thing about this car is that it's quick as all get-out. The ZX2, of course, looks like Ford took a regular Escort, gave it two doors, widened it here, lengthened it there and put too much engine under the hood. This car weighs in at a little over two tons, and is pulled down the road by a 130-horsepower Zetec engine. That engine produces a fair amount of torque just about all of the time. If you hit the accelerator, you're gone. And, seeing how it only cost about $13,500, that feeling alone is worth the price. This car is a go-kart for adults, and is a heck of a lot of fun to drive.

As for styling, the car looks aggressive and fast. It looks rather like an Escort that got tired of being pushed around by sportier cars, so it added some beefier tires, snazzy wheels, a few swoops here and there, and vowed to get even. This car was made to appeal to folks who are out of college and starting careers in that it looks sporty and moves down the road pretty quickly. As I was 29-years-old when I purchased it, I suppose I fell into the group to which Ford decided to market the ZX2.

There are a few downsides to the car, though. First of all, understeer is quite noticeable, as it is on many smallish, front-wheel drive cars. Additionally, the five-speed standard feels wrong at times. The feel of the clutch is great, but shifting feels a bit stiff and awkward at times, and it's sometimes hard to find reverse.

Reverse is a fine gear, and I'd hate to not be able to back up my car. With a little pounding, though, I've always been able to get it in reverse. Still, the shift travel could have been considerably smoother. I can't imagine buying one of these things with an automatic transmission because it's a heck of a lot of fun do downshift into fourth on the interstate, wind up that engine and fly by people at silly speeds. A bit difficult, perhaps, but a sporty car is more fun with a standard than an automatic any day of the week.

Then, there's the storage space. Drink holders are all over the place, buy they're small. The trunk, also, is small, but I may have expected a bit much as I was used to the generous space offered by the old Escorts with hatchbacks. The interior and gauge panels do their jobs, but they're nothing to write home about in terms of cool styling.

The last complaint is the stereo. It's kind of tinny and not to powerful. Worst of all, don't plan on changing out the stock receiver, cassette and CD-player -- they're in a weird configuration that's not suited to custom units. Fortunately, you can have both a CD and cassette in this car.

Does it make a good family car, though? Well, I found out a few months after I purchased it because I got married to a woman with a two-year-old son. While a car seat isn't exactly what you'd expect to find in a ZX2, the boy seems pretty comfortable back there. He's about the only one, by the way, who'd find those tiny back seats comfortable. My wife and I prefer her Saturn as a family car. It's not as quick as the ZX2, but is more roomy and has more storage space.

This car is a fantastic value. It's cheap, reliable and fun. It travels well in snow, and gets you from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot; very quickly and in an enjoyable way. The thing corners like a charm and makes drives down curvy state highways a true thrill.

Before I conclude this sprawling mess, I've got to throw in my story about the Honda Accord. I test drove one of those before buying the ZX2, and liked it okay. The salesman told me how much I'd have to pay for the thing, and I asked, &quot;Are you kidding me?&quot; He told me he might be able to talk to someone to back-off the mid-$20k price, but I told him to keep his car. I could afford it, but why should I pay that much cash just so I can have a fairly unimpressive vehicle that says &quot;Honda&quot; on it?

As for the Civic, it's both cheaper and more boring. Saturn, Ford and Chrysler, I suspect, are having fun kicking the soup out of the Civic with their low-end cars that are a lot more fun.

Image doesn't matter that much to me, so I'm glad I picked up my cheap old ZX2. It might not be impressive to those who are concerned with such things, but it's a heck of a lot of fun.<br><br>
