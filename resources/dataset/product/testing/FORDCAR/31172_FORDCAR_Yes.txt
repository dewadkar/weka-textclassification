            Of all the cars I've owned, the Mustang is by far the best value and definitely the best bang for the buck.  I bought my '98 GT brand new back in May, 1998.  It has almost every option except for ABS brakes, which I now wish I had gotten.

Here are my impressions of Mustang ownership compared to other cars I have owned (2 Pontiac Trans Ams, 2 Mustangs, 1 Acura Integra, 2 Porsches, 3 BMWs, 1 VW):

Quality.  The build quality of the car is vastly improved over the previous generation Mustangs.  The handling, braking, steering feel and overall feel of the car is also far above the previous generation.  Compared to the foreign cars I've owned, however, the Mustang falls short.  There are a couple of small buzzes and creaks that I hear on my daily drive that are irritating.  Considering the performance and level of equipment I got for the money, I guess I can't really complain about the level of workmanship.

Comfort.  I am 6'2" and really wish that the front seats would have more travel.  I know this was fixed on the '99 and up cars, but unfortunately I cannot get accustomed to the new chiseled look of the newer Mustangs.  Down the road I will find a fix for the seat travel problem.  The other problem I have is with the seats themselves.  Although the seats are very comfortable, they are not the ideal seats for a "sports car."  These are the kind of seats I would expect to find in an entry level car, not Ford's pony car.  Overall I find them mediocre at best.

Additionally, the headrests leave a lot to be desired.  My fiancï¿½ had a '96 Mustang GT with better headrests than my 98!  The 96 had headrests that could be adjusted for height and tilt - and were bigger than the current ones.  Although far from perfect, they were much better than the garbage in my '98.  The current headrests look as if they have been taken out of a mid 70s Ford LTD.  For a tall driver, they are useless in case of a rear end collision.  I plan on taking out those seats soon and installing a pair of aftermarket Recaros or Flofits to correct this matter.  Aside from those two gripes, the car is quite comfortable.  I have taken it on a few extended trips and it has fared quite well.

Performance.  The car accelerates quite well and allows you to cruise with traffic effortlessly.  My fuel consumption average has ranged from a low of 18mpg combined hwy/city driving to a high of 25mpg on extended trips.  For the kind of visceral thrills the car provides, it's a bargain to own.  It runs equally good with 87 octane gas as any car I've owned.  No complaints whatsoever.  If you are looking for the brutal acceleration of the Camaro Z28 or Firebird Formula/Trans Am, the '94 through '98 GTs will disappoint though.  Handling is on the safe side, understeering quite a bit.

Reliability.  My car is about to hit 40,000 miles and I have only had one non-scheduled visit to the dealer.  The driver's window fell out of alignment and wasn't closing properly.  The dealer fixed it in one day and the service was excellent, which is a far cry from the service I was used to in the 80s from Ford dealers.  Aside from the window problem, my GT has surpassed every car I have owned in terms of reliability, even my Acura Integra.  I have been running synthetic oil (either Mobil 1 or Amsoil) since about 10,000 miles and highly recommend it.

Overall.  If you are buying a Mustang GT expecting to have the performance of a Corvette, the handling of a Ferrari, the brakes of a Porsche, and the overall refinement of a BMW, you will be highly disappointed.  If you are looking for an affordable modern muscle car, then you've come to the right place.  If you are ready to live with the noisy exhaust, cramped quarters, higher than average visibility to highway patrol troopers, higher insurance and overall lack of refinement from this muscle car, you cannot go wrong.  If I drive my Volvo for a week straight without touching the Mustang, I begin to wonder why I bought the car in the first place.  However, after the first couple of miles behind the wheel of the GT I am reminded why.  It is fast, reliable, relatively economical and a whole lot of fun to drive.  Then I look at how much I have spent on repairs in almost 40,000 miles and an even bigger smile comes to my face.

Update: My Mustang served me well up to 47K miles, when I took it to the Lincoln dealer and traded it in.  Regretfully (I say that because I miss the car) they gave me a very good trade-in allowance and a new 2001 Lincoln LS is now occupying the spot formerly taken by the Mustang.
