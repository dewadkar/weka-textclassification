            I bought my 1999 Ford F150 Regular Cab 4X4 in October, 1998. As to this day, I <b>LOVE IT!!</b>  I have always liked the design of the Ford trucks and I've always heard good stories about their reliability.  When I graduated from college and got a real job, I decided to find out for myself.  I ordered my truck with almost every option.  It is the XLT model, 4X4, 5.4 liter Triton V8, automatic, flairside bed, trailer tow, off road package, CD Player, etc.  It took about 8 weeks to get the truck after it was ordered.  This was less than the estimated 10 weeks.  I was pleasantly surprised.

The truck is great for all types of needs.  If you need to tow something, there is more than enough power.  If you need to take a road trip, the truck is comfortable enough for 1500 mile trips that I've taken with it.  I've even gotten as high as 19 mpg on the highway.  That is pretty good for a full size 4x4 truck!!  It will also haul large loads and is excellent off road and in the snow!! If you need a vehicle to shine and look nice for in town, this truck will do it. (Dark blue with chrome wheels helps here!!)

I now have over 22,000 miles on the truck with only one problem.  That problem was an oil leak that Ford took care of very quickly.  I was treated very well, even though I'm only 24 and some dealers of other manufacturers treated me like just a punk kid!!

I can't say enough positive things about this truck.  It is an excellent, dependable source of transportation.
