            My Toyota lost 4th gear.As a Home Health nurse, my car is important. Bought a '98 used with 23,600 miles on it Memorial Day weekend.  It handles great. Did have a problem with gas tank.  Seemed the sensor was stuck and the fuel gauge wouldn't go to empty, so I barely made it to a station a few times. Finally they repaired it, but forgot to put a new O ring  in place and my fuel tank leaked. Got it fixed for good.  Had to have the whole front electronic panel(speedometer, etc) replaced.This was fixed under warranty. So now instead of showing actual mileage, they put a sticker on the door panel with mileage statement when it was replaced.  I get 22-26 miles per gallon of gas.  I have a V-6 with good power, power windows, power side view mirrors, AC, PS, electronic over drive( small button on left had side of gear shift knob) This helps slow you down into curves, or down hills, without having to brake.  I use it when I see a police car regardless of my speed. 4 door, great family car. Lots of room.  Seat belt adjusts up and down so you aren't choked. It handles the mountain roads wonderfully, no squealing, don't see any wear on the tires yet.  It has had 2 recalls. Shift plate panel and I can't remember the other. First American made car I've had in 11 years.  Couldn't afford a Toyota, but I am pleased with this vehicle.  <br><br>
