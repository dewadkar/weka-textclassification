            This review is not about the new style current Ranger . It is about an older version , a 1986 white one . Bare bones truck . It didn't even come with a radio since it was bought as a supposedly temporary work truck for the family business . It's a little 5 speed . No carpet in it . As I said , no original radio (it has one now ) . 
And guess what . This little truck is still our company truck , not to be gotten rid of until she literally goes belly-up on us . It has well over 300,000 miles on it . It has been in at least 3 accidents in my memory , all minor thank goodness ! It was backed over a street sign . It is used to haul all of the equipment for our phone service . The average weight she carries , 7 days a week is about 500-750 pounds . It also has a large shell and carries 2 ladders as well . 
The only thing wrong with this truck after this long ? The driver's side seat belt wore out and the stick shift needed a new handle . And this is without regular maintenance . I can't remember the last time the oil was changed . The shocks were finally replaced when we noticed that they had visually worn through the casings . 
If you can find a little truck as nice as this one ... Buy It . You won't be sorry . <br><br>
