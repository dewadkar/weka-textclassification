            It's sometime after midnight, and I'm sitting at a stoplight at a quiet intersection heading out of town.  My bright red 1992 v6 Ford Thunderbird has around 120,000 miles on the odometer, and despite the fact that the mileage is so high and the transmission has had a slow leak since it was resealed at 60k, and I have a 65 mile drive home to the rural area where I live when I get off work at 11:30pm, my Tbird has never left me stranded.  

Another car pulls up next to me, a newer looking Mustang.  I glance over, and the driver locks eyes with me and jerks his head toward the road ahead.  I look away, tempted, but reminding myself that after my Tbird turned over 100,000 miles I had decided to take it easy and baby it along.  But...I roll my windows up and look back at the driver.  Through the tint, I can see that he's still watching me and doing that head jerk thing.

We both inch forward, waiting for the light to turn green.  As soon as it does, I hit the accelerator.  The Tbird's back tires thrust it forward, and it lunges forward.  I see the Mustang in my side mirror; he's right at my flank, and I can see his car jerk as he shifts.  But the 'bird is first as we hit 60 miles an hour, and that's as fast as I'm willing to go on a dark road where I have seen deer many times at night.  I back off the accelerator, and the Mustang charges past me.  As he goes by, I see the 5.0 badge.  If we had kept it up, he surely would have blown us away, but I counted it as a victory.  I patted my 'bird on the dash and promised it that was the last time I would ask it to go head to head with someone, and it would be smooth, even paced driving from there on out.  I retired my Thunderbird with a bang.  Sadly, last year, the Tbird was totaled when I gave it to my brother to drive and he cracked it up.  No, he'll never be forgiven for that.It had 148k on the odometer and was still running strong.  

My father bought the Thunderbird in 1994.  After my father died in 1995 I took the payments over.  The car was always special to me because my father had always been so proud of that car.  It had 20,000 miles on it when my dad bought it, and I believe the sticker prices was around $13,000.  It was BRIGHT red, not that cheesy "laser red" that Ford put on later Tbird, but a screaming red that made me cringe every time I looked at.  After I got used to the glaring color, I could appreciate how sharp it looked when polished up, wheels gleaming white, tires shiny black.  It literally turned heads in this state; at a donut shop once, I was walking out, and when I looked back I saw the clerk had come from around the counter and was standing with his face pressed against the glass, staring at the Thunderbird.  The rear wheel drive took some getting used to; the Thunderbird was not as forgiving as the lightweight Chevy Beretta I usually drove.  For a v6 it could really dig out at the stop lights; it outsprinted all comers, except for two Camaros.  

The only real complaint I could make about the Tbird was about the seats and the stereo.  The stereo was pretty poor sounding; I've come to the quality that GM leads the race in factory sound.  The seats, although well padded, were very flat, and could get uncomfortable on long trips.  Not much leg room in the front, which was something I got used to, and even less leg room in the back.  But it was a smooth, quiet ride on the freeway.

There are a couple of issues that I've noticed people seem to have with the 90s Tbirds that I'd like to mention.  
 
<b>Flickering Headlights</b>

At about 90-100,000 miles, I started having a problem with the headlights flickering after driving 15 miles or so.  It was in and out of the shop several times, and I was charged for replacement switches each time, as they tried to figure out what the problem was.  Resolution: multifunction switch in the steering column.  Hopefully, this will save someone out there with a Tbird with the same problem some time and money.

<b>Transmission</b>

At 60k, my transmission started pouring fluid out in the driveway and needed to be resealed.  Ever since that incident, I was plagued with a very slow leak - topped off at every oil change it was okay - as long as I took it to an oil change place every 3,000 miles that actually checked and refilled the fluids, it was okay.  However, I have heard some real nightmare stories about Ford transmissions, the Tbird tranny in particular.  It seems that there is a Vehicle Speed Sensor that fails sometimes, and crooked shops will charge the customer for a new transmission.  If your transmission is slipping, beware, and realize that this could be the problem.  My mother owned a 95 Mercury Sable with a slipping/jerking transmission, and this turned out to be the problem.

I loved my Thunderbird.  It had the best of all possible worlds, and was the first car I ever owned that I didn't get bored with after a year.  Every day I wish I still had it, and if Ford still made RWD Tbirds with that body style, I'd happily buy a new one.  I now drive a 95 Monte Carlo, which I would consider to be in the same class as the Tbird.  The Chevy is a big, nice, comfortable car, but it just doesn't hold a candle to the Tbird.
