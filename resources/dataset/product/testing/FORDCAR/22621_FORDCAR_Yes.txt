            Bought my brothers 1986 Ford Aerostar. Actually, given the price I paid for it, you might say he gave it to me. The ride is smooth, quiet, livingroom comfortable on a trip. Plenty of power. Good gas mileage. Pretty to look at, fun to drive.

Just don't drive it too long! I mean, give it up after it turns the odometer over once. First, the wheel bearing. Then the brakes. The A/C. The driver's side power window. Next, the passenger side power window. The radiator started to leak. The transmission went out. Lost the alternator, although it did hold on for almost a year just barely charging.

Almost forgot. The rocker panels rusted out almost overnight. There one day, gone the next. Replaced both U-joints, but it still clanks when going into gear. Bought new top of the line shocks when I got it, but they didn't last long. Probably the springs are a little worn.

The drivers seat is leaning badly to the left. Ask my brother Tom why that is!!! 

OK, lets be fair. This is all normal maintainence, really. The problem is the normal maintainence came all at once, it seems. 

Don't get me wrong, I love the van. Runs and rides great. Because of the price I paid for it, I'm still way ahead of the game, financially. But what if I'd have purchased it from a used car lot? Hmmmmm. I probably wouldn't be feeling as pleased with it. 

So, would I buy another one? Sure if the price was right. 
My step daughter, Kim, just inherited the van.

I just bought a 1994 Chevy Astro Van. $24,000 dollars when new. Very nice. Second time I drove it, the key locked in the ignition, wouldn't shift out of reverse, and something broke in the steering column. 

Stay tuned for an update on this, my latest adventure in the fine art of van ownership.<br><br>
