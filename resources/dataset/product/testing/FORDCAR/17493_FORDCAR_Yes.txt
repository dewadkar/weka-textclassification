            I have just purchased my new 2002 Ford F150 work truck.  I ordered it striped down because of what I was going to use it for...a work truck.  Even this base model was more than I expected.

Interior is nice, with easy to clean lines, vinyl flooring, and a bench seat.  It is comfortable seating with plenty of seat adjustment.  Air conditioning is plenty to deal with the 100 degree days we have just experienced.  The stripped down am/fm cassette player is all you could ask for at this price.

The V6 is plenty of power to pull me up the hills around town.  Five speed manual transmission is smooth as silk and very easy to drive.  Steering is how it is supposed to be.  Easy enough to turn in parking lots but not too sensitive for highway use.

The exterior is nicely done.  There is plenty of room to put in decals and signs for your business.  This is one sharp looking truck put together with a great package.  For a work truck....who could ask for anything more?
