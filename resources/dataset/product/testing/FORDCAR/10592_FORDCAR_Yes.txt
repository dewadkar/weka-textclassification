            I purchased my 2000 Ranger new from my local Ford dealer.  I must say that compared to an S-10, I would choose my ranger any day. The 2.5L 4 cyl. has adequate power, (faster than a 2000 S-10 anyway). It's definately not a race truck but has enough power to pull a small trailer or boat. I would opt. for the 4x4. I did not, and I regret it every winter.  Rating for snow use is about a D. The regular cab could also use a little more space. If you are 6ft. tall or above, consider a bigger truck or an extended cab Ranger, or you will be eating your knees. The suspension could use some help.  I had some helper springs installed and that helped out alot.  The flareside bed looks good, but takes a lot of space out of an already somewhat small bed.  There are many companies that make add-on, accessory or upgrade parts. Clear lenses, etc.. I have had my Ranger for 36 months and have 40,000 miles, and have never had one mechanical problem.  Although my speedometer cable is making a noise in the dash now, but that is it. Just keep the oil changed and I believe you will have yourself a very reliable daily driver that is affordable, looks good, and will never let you down.
