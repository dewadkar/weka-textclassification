              My wife and I bought a 1994 3.8 V6 Mustang last summer as a combination second car/fun toy.  We spend a bit of time choosing just the &quot;right&quot; car for us, and when we first saw the Mustang we thought that the combination of monthly payment and insurance costs, that the car wasn't going to be what we were looking for.  

  Well after checking on the insurance we were truly surprised to find that the Insurance on a V6 Mustang was actually cheaper than the car we already owned which is a 1995 Pontiac Sunfire (go figure!!).  Not only that but the monthly payment wound up being cheaper too!!

  Needless to say we checked it out pretty good before buying it, we took it to a mechanic and the whole &quot;nine yards&quot;, and everything looked good.  So we bought it that next saturday afternoon, with a 30 day warranty.  Well we had it for just over a month and the Transmission &quot;nuked&quot; on us!

  I had quite a hassle finding anyone that could re-build a Ford AOD-E (Automatic Over Drive-Electronic) transmission not to mention one that could be recommended.  After finding one and taking the &quot;tranny&quot; to him for him to figure out exactly what happened and whether or not it was even worth re-building.  We discovered that the AODE transmissions in the 1994 V6 Mustangs weren't the strongest Factory trannys available.  So we wound up installing some heavy duty direct Clutches in it so that it would operate more like the AODE from the GT version tranny. We also purchased a TransGo Valve Body Shift Kit for it and had it installed during the re-build.  Problem solved!  One other bit of advise is to re-place the head gaskets on the car ASAP with some heavy duty ones too!! Ford has acknowledged the fact that the Head Gaskets are weak on them, however has not done a full re-call on them as of yet.

  Other than those two little problems we had with the car since purchasing it, we love the car completely and wee don't ever plan to sell it.  We even take it up to the local drag strip everynow and then and we have a basement with all sorts of peformance parts to be installed on it as soon as the weather gets better!!

  The car is an absolute THRILL to drive, decent acceleration (made even better by a NOS kit and 3.45:1 rear end gears to replace the stock 2.73:1's), good handling (We installed a Strut tower brace to further enhance the handling), one thing to note is that Mustangs have never been good at stopping, and even with that addition of rear disc brakes starting on our model year is no exception. (we hardly even notice it now that we are used to driving it).

  This car is not for everyone however.  If you have Children that are a decent height they will not be comfortable riding in the back seat as it doesn't have a lot of leg room, because of how the front seats are mounted further back than would be on most cars, and Adults would be hard pressed to find a remotely comfortable seating position in back (however the front seats are better than a lazy boy!).  Don't plan on buying a Mustang as a grocery getter either as the trunk is only big enough to fit about 4-5 grocery bags without crushing your bread or eggs.  If you are looking for a car that is just plain fun to drive and to toy around with that gets reasonable gas mileage then don't over look the V6 Mustang.<br><br>
