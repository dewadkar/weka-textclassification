            <b>If you were a car manufacturer, you would do just about anything to have an icon on your hands. Whatever the secret is, Ford Motors knows it: the Ford Mustang is just that.</b>
Thus, this car needs little introduction to the buyer. In fact, many people who purchase a Mustang know what they want from the very start� 
With this in mind, I made the drive to a nearby Ford dealership and gave the base V6 Mustang (fit the budget) a whirl. After returning the keys two days later, I had a pretty good grasp on what the ��Stang� was all about.

<b>EXTERIOR:  8</b>
The Mustang got a major makeup job in 1999, and is unchanged for 2000, minus a �Sport Package� that is available for V6 models. The Mustang's new edgy look took some getting used to for me, but after a while, I began to like it. Even the base models look <b>more aggressive</b> than before. The rear track is wider, giving the Mustang a larger rump. The outer sheet metal all around has been rounded off as well. Outside of these cosmetics, the Mustang still sits on one of the industry�s oldest rear-wheel chasses. I guess Ford�s opinion is �why change a good thing?�

<b>INTERIOR: 6</b>
Inside the Mustang, you will see very few changes if any compared to previous models (even 1993). Thus, the <b>dash looks clean but dated</b>. Cheap plastic abounds, which doesn�t spell �durable� in my book. The manual shifter is rather odd-looking for my tastes. It also blocks access to the CD controls. The automatic shifter doesn�t give you this problem once it�s put in �drive.� The climate system is around average, but the sound system did not impress me at all. I�d recommend upgrading to their Mach Sound System, or just doing one all on your own. (<i>A side note:</i>The Chevy Camaro�s stereo sounds much better, although the rest of the interior advantages go to the Mustang.) There seems to be a lot of room inside the Mustang, but the back seat is ideally suited for tots. Getting in and out of the back seat is quite a chore, too. The trunk of the Mustang is small, and the glove compartment won�t hold anything more than the owner�s manual.

<b>ENGINE: 8</b>
Marked improvements in power were made for 1999: the 3.8L V6 is up 40 ponies to 190hp, and the GT V8 models have been upgraded to 260hp. The way I see it, the new V6 (which gives you 220 lb.-ft. torque @ 2,750 rpm) gives you <b>a lot of punch for the money</b>- something you didn�t see before the upgrade. While the base engine is not as powerful as the Camaro/Firebird engines, it still gives you confident passing ability and may be enough to dissuade you from buying the pricier GT.

<b>RIDE:  7</b>
The Mustang�s suspension was revised for 1999. With these changes went some of the harshness of the ride of previous models- I could feel the difference. The ride is <b>more solid</b>, too. You will still be able to �drive by Braille,� as the saying goes, but the ride is pleasant enough and not jarring. Even though the Mustang is a sports car, its engine makes a little more noise than I�d like, especially under hard acceleration. I had to raise my voice numerous times when conversing.

<b>HANDLING: 7</b>
The Mustang does a decent job handling corners and split-second emergency maneuvers. Some body lean was noticed when I intentionally swerved the car around. The brakes of the Mustang were also improved for 1999, and do well when called upon. I recommend the optional All-Speed Traction Control for more sure-footed performance. You may find it�s worth the price.

<b>VALUE: 7</b>
The Ford Mustang is a <b>reasonable value</b>: for a pretty good price, you get pretty good performance out of a pretty good sports car. Many people buy the Mustang for the looks, and it will not disappoint. I found the Mustang to be a little stingy on features, but it holds its value better than its GM rivals, which will cease production within the next couple of years. Plus, Mustangs are very easy cars to modify and upgrade.

<b>RELIABILITY:  6</b>
Consumer Guide has listed reliability for the Mustang as �average,� but recently I have noticed an increasing number of disgruntled Mustang owners. The way I see it, any further research will uncover both really happy as well as really ticked Mustang owners. Still, the Mustang did not make a strong case for solid build quality when I drove it: the doors shut with a clang rather than a thud, and a few rattles could be heard coming from the trunk area when I went over bumps.

<b>THE VERDICT: AMERICA'S PONY CAR HAS IMPROVED... BUT COULD BE BETTER</b>
I can see how the Mustang has done so well: it outsells its GM rivals (Camaro/Firebird) by about 2 to 1� <i>combined</i>. In my opinion, it appeals to a broader base of consumers than the GM twins do. But to say I was convinced the base Mustang is the <i>best</i> offering for a sports car in this price range might be stretching things a bit. But if an icon is what you want, and you don't mind that everyone <i>else</i> is driving one, then give the Mustang a look. 

<i>*Note: This review concerns the BASE V6 Mustang, which is far and away the most popular model bought by consumers. If you want info on the GT or Cobra, check out some of the other excellent articles on this site.</i>
