            This is a car that can and will change most opinions about full-sized cars. When many people look at this car the most popular opinion that comes to mind is a lumbering, slow, fuel-guzzling oaf that ruins pavement as it wallows down the road. In reality that could'nt be more wrong. For instance, slow has little meaning if any meaning to my car when the accelerator petal is dropped to the floor. Many modified "sport-compact" cars have been taught a lesson in power at many stop lights by my Ford, and toll continues to rise. This car is among the first year equipped CV's to receive the all new 4.6l OHC V8. Horsepower in base models was 190,  on models equipped with dual exhaust that figure rose to  
210(however, i've been recently hearing that police package CV's had 225, but i am unsure at this time if that is true). Now some might say "but my Pontiac Grand Prix supercharged has 240 horsepower, how can you say that you can beat me from the stoplight?" Easy, the 4.6 flat out revs quicker. Thanks to its over head cam design, this engine does'nt need to use its own power to overcome pushrods in the valvetrain. This engine simply doesnt have them. Also this engine is way more reliable than any i have ever owned in the past. 
I honestly think the engineers and designers who worked on this engine really did thier homework, good job Ford! 
The most money i've ever spent on service was $160.00 for a tune up. Currently my '92 has 240,000 mi. showing on the clock and i swear it feels like it's just "broke-in".
Now as for the interior I think they have done a good job, the styling is good for it's time, and guages and controls are easy to read and operate. room is at an all time high in this car, or in other words it's just plain big. With ample head and leg room(the only complaint comes from my wife who says she doesnt have enough leg room, but she's 6'2"!). Also how many people can actually fit 6 people in thier cars; anybody? Speaking of room this car has enough trunk space to almost be classified as an SUV. However, the seats are relatively flat and cant support you if your trying to corner this car. I know I have grab hold of the arm rest when executing a sharp curve at 60mph, but i've been told that bolting Recarro seats in the car would solve that problem. The problem with that is you reduce your seating capacity. Another point to make is that handling is surprizingly good. This car can almost corner as well as a sports car, Even in inclement weather. The only downside is lack of road feel. lets face it, this car is heavy. So its never going to corner like a Porche, but it will hold its own against most cars on our roads today. I do however still see room for improvement, so all you road warriors take notice these cars are being modified by people who know, and they most likely wont take prisoners. The dark side of all this, is the brakes. Sorry CV fans but this is the one area where this car sucks. Truely better brakes should have been a top priority when engineering this car. The 10" front rotors and 3" single piston floating calipers should have been put on a smaller, lighter car. The brakes easily overheat and badly warped rotors are the end result. Go figure, they have to stop a 4000lbs. car, I personally think the people resposible for designing those brakes for that car are insane. I just dont know how else to say it. I mean going fast and handling are great, but ride gets too exciting when you just cant stop as well. Now lets talk practicallity. I'm sure that many still believe that you can't have a full-sized car and good fuel economy too. 
Wrong, even with the mileage showing that mine does I still get 18-19mpg city and 25-26mpg highway. Which is exceptional when you take into account all that does in fact work against this car in that department(i.e. weight, size, engine, etc.). Really there is not a lot about this car that I dont like about this car but I really find the styling of the body lacking. I'm sure all of you know what I mean when I say, it looks like Ford took the front end of a T-bird. The rear end of a Taurus, and put a bubble in between. This is not the most glamourous car on the road. 
But hey, at least it looks better than a YUGO.  :-)
