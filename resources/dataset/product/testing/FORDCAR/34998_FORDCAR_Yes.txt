<TEXT>
            In 1990, having tired of my worn out Toyota, I decided to step up - by twelve years.  At the local Ford dealer, they had a Probe that just wasn't getting the interest.  I saw the midnight blue GT, and wanted to drive it just to see how such a big car could be in the sport class.
After fifteen minutes, and after scaring myself with the acceleration of this front-wheel drive turbocharged machine, I knew it had to be mine. That is a decision I've never regretted, BUT, I have been challenged.
* The good points:  
It loves to run at 85 on the freeways and Interstates, and gets an honest 30 to 32 MPG!!!
Outside, this is a fairly small car, but the inside is spacious and comfortable.  I can drive the Probe for eight hours, and still be able to stand, walk, and feel great.
The five-speed stick, coupled with the turbocharged 4 cylinder gives me plenty of pickup, but seldom do I need to punch it hard enough to show anything on the turboboost. It still runs GREAT after 140,000 miles.
* The facts of life:
After ten years in the California desert sun, the paint is shot, gone, kaput, and has been getting that way since 1994.
Maintenance is expensive when it needs to be done, which, fortunately, is not often.  I have had to replace both power window drives, at $500+ each, and the front struts have been replaced.
* The oddities:
The panel gauges sometimes have nothing tom do with reality.  I'll be driving along, and suddenly, without apparent cause or reason, the gauge shows top-limit hot, the ammeter shows full discharge, and the gas tank is suddenly full.  After a while, everything settles back down.
It also groans!  Yes, it actually makes a deep groaning soound somewhere in the panel, maybe once or twice an hour.  The Ford mechanics have no huess as to what all this is about, and have been absolutely baffled on the gauges problems.
* Overall:
I love the car, and will probably repaint it next year.  I was sorry to see Ford mess with, and mess up the Probe, and the GT version with the turbo charger is definitely missed. If they built a Probe today with a blower, I'd seriously consider it.<br><br>
