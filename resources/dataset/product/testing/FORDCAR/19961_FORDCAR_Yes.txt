            We bought our Ford Taurus used almost 2 yrs ago. Before we had a truck that only three people could sit in. Anyway I became pregnant, so now we need something  that will seat one more.
We went to the same car lot where we got the used truck and traded it in for our '90 Ford Taurus.
We picked this car because of the nice look inside and out. The outside was a little sporty, but not to extreme. There were no scratches, dents or anything.
The inside was just as nice, all the seat belts worked, no rips or holes in the seats. 
The only thing that didn't work was the air conditioner.
The person that had this car before us really took care of it, we even found a toy in the backseat in the cushion :)
Of course we have had to have minor things done such as change the oil, get the brake pads looked at. Got to expect that with any car.
But I love our Taurus<br><br>
