            I personally own a 1998 Contour SE V6 5 speed.  It was ordered from the factory with all options but the moon roof.  This car is fantastic to drive, corners like its on rails, accelerates like a V8.  The suspension, V6 and 5 speed make this car a poor mans BMW.  However don't expect the quality of a BMW when it comes to interior plastics.  I have leather seating and it helps take away from the cheap plastics.  When most folks think of the Contour they think of the 4 cylinder automatics that abound at the rental agency.  Test drive the V6 SE 5 speed and you will change your mind.  This car is the best value/performer on the market today.  On a sad note, Ford has decided to discontinue the Contour/Mystique.  So hurry in and test drive, you won't be sorry.  As far as reliability, there have been 5 recalls on my Contour.  This however has never hampered the cars reliability.  At 25K its solid as day 1.    <br><br>
