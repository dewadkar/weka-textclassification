            One of those silly e-mail joke lists made its way across my desktop on a recent afternoon -- my buddy the Goddess of Geophysics is a prolific joke-forwarder (praise her!). This particular entry in the ongoing joke wars was one of those lists with titles like <i>You Might Be A Redneck...</i>. This time, the title was <i>You Might Be From Texas...</i> (the GoG is Cajun right down to the bone, and as such delights in tweaking the noses of the big-hatted folks to the west of her homeland). Down around number sixteen, the list said "...if you've ever gotten a new car home and found out it wouldn't fit in your garage." 

Well I grinned a little, but I really didn't think a lot about such things happening until the nice young guys at Enterprise sent me out with a sparkling white Ford Expedition for three days a few days later. I climbed in and motored on down from Austin to Houston, making mental review notes as I drove. I stopped at a client's office for a few hours when I got to town, and then along about six o'clock I headed over to my hotel. I was poised to wheel the Expedition into the parking garage when a bright yellow-and-black sign caught my eye: <b>Maximum Clearance 6'1"</b>! 

I was suddenly aware that I couldn't see the top of that white whale unless I was standing on its running board. "Just how tall <i>is</i> this thing?" I wondered to myself. "Am I about to make like Max Headroom?" I wasn't taking any chances, though: I reversed out of the garage entrance and parked in the oversize lot.

It's a darned good thing I didn't absent-mindedly drive straight in; 'cause topping out a $33,000 SUV would have severely depleted my bank account. The 2WD Expedition -- according to the specs in the owner's manual -- is six feet four inches tall. Throw in the roof rack, and it's about six-six. Hmmm, I'm thinking, this vehicle is just about the right height to play small forward in the NBA! But looking at my my notes from the three-day rental tells the whole sad story: while the whale's got the size, the whale just doesn't have the moves.


<b>One More Time When Bigger Ain't Necessarily Better</b>

The Expedition is little more than a gussied-up enclosed pickup truck. Because it's been enclosed, though, it's lost the characteristic utilitarian nature of a pickup truck: while you can fit cargo into the back of the thing, you can't fit very much (and not very dirty cargo, for that matter). Because the frame members were designed to be truck-like, the Expedition rides and handles like a large, top-heavy pickup truck. If that's what you want, then fine. If you're expecting a comfortable car-like ride (as might well befit a vehicle in the $30K+ range) then perhaps you should be looking at something else. At an actual car, perhaps? 

Somebody out there advertises that their SUV is "positioned between the toys and the tanks" (struth, it's Edward Hermann, shilling for the Dodge Durango). The Expedition is definitely on the "tank" end of the spectrum. The last time I found myself driving something this size, it was pulling a seven-bottom plow... But enough editorializing about whether anyone actually <i>needs</i> a vehicle like the Expedition; let's get to the review.


<b>The Lap of Semi-Luxury</b>

The interior of the Expedition (XLT edition) is a far cry from utilitarian, though it's not truly luxurious, either. The vehicle seats eight, with the front two in cushy captain's chairs, the middle three in a capacious bench seat, and the hindmost triplet crammed into a space reminiscent of the rear seat of a VW Beetle (the <i>original</i> Beetle, mind you). That back seat folds flat for additional room, and can be removed to further expand the cargo space. With seat three in place, there's little room for luggage except perhaps a few overnight bags. A standard rack allows for roof transport of luggage (a questionable concept for so large a vehicle). Either side or both on the middle seat also fold forward (on a sixty-forty split) to partially expand the cargo area; cunning little snap-down fillers create a flat surface instead of lumpy-bumpy seat-backs and -bases. Access to the rear seat is over the folded right-side seat; it requires two pretty strong hands to operate the catch and flip forward the seat components.

Throughout the passenger compartment you'll find several small cubbies on the doors; of a size sufficient for scrapers, CDs, maps, and other hand-sized items. Console storage is of a good size, but the glove compartment is barely large enough for the owners' manuals and warranty documents. Neither compartment, by the way, can be locked. There are also small trays for change or chips molded into the console; these feature removable non-skid mats in the bottom. There are two snazzy ceiling-mounted holders for sunglasses or a garage-door opener; neither would hold my non-standard shades (Gargoyles, if you must know).

Cup holders abound -- two molded into the console, two on a slide-out (one of which holds a removable lidded ashtray), and a pair on the back of the console for middle-seat riders. There's no place for the poor schmoes in the back to set their Big Gulps, though. Two power ports (one defaulting to cigarette lighter status) grace the dashboard; there's a third port at the rearside base of the console.

The passengers sit on high, as if passing judgment on nearby traffic. The driver's seat features power-enhanced six-way movement plus lumbar adjustment; the steering wheel tilts (although through a somewhat narrow range, I thought). For the little lady (or little man, I guess), the pedals may also be adjusted up and down using a dashboard-mounted switch.


<b>Semi-Mechanicals</b>

The standard AM/FM/Cassette (no CD player in the rental :( ) is pretty much plain vanilla; no special capabilities and just ordinary sound. There's a handy set of switches on the back of the console so that middle seat passengers can join in the fight over the radio controls. There are also two headphone jacks that take the small-diameter (2mm?) pin plugs found on portable electronics.

The climate control system also offers separate controls for the front and rear sections of the vehicle, with both ceiling- and console-mounted controls. The dashboard controls feature Ford's normal senseless design, in which there is no separate on/off button for the A/C (it's merely one position on the selector dial). The climate control had no difficulty in keeping up with the typical Gulf Coast temperature and humidity; I cannot speak to the efficacy of the heater.


<b>Other Goodies</b>

- remote-controlled, heated sideview mirrors
- two-way lift gate (though just opening the glass leaves the window sill 40-inches plus above ground level)
- lighted running boards
- rear-window washer/wiper and defroster
- keyless entry pad
- intermittent wipers
- power windows/doorlocks (including "mommy" locks) and remote-controlled entry/alarm system
- steering-wheel mounted cruise control
- Dual front airbags (no passenger-side switch, however)


<b>The Guts</b>

The optional 5.4-liter V8 ($700) ran well. The 260-hp power plant pushes the 5000-pound vehicle around with good reserve power; it also obtained far better gas mileage than I had expected. On my 400-mile trip, most of which was highway driving, I averaged 16.3 MPG (EPA estimates are 13 City, 18 Highway). The "smart" electronic four-speed automatic transmission operated smoothly, without that annoying "hunting" sensation when suddenly accelerated at highway speeds (Dodge, take note).


<b>The Ride</b>

Other than its ridiculously large size, the major problem I had with the Expedition is its road handling capabilities. The vehicle is sensitive to crosswinds because of its high profile - a 20mph quartering wind had my ride wandering all over the lane. The driver has little feel for the road; having been separated by the sloppy steering typical of big American-made vehicles and a suspension tuned far more for ironing out bumps than for maintaining control. There is quite a bit of lateral sway over uneven roads, further detracting from the vehicle's handling.


<b>The Down and Dirty</b>

<i>On the positive side</i>, the Expedition has power to spare and will carry five people in comfort (and another three in relative comfort). Its high-output yet fuel-efficient engine yields highly competitive fuel economy while providing a towing capacity of 5500 pounds. Performance is better than average, ride is average. In comparison to the Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Expedition has better fuel efficiency and better handling (although that isn't saying much).

<i>The accelerator pedal:</i>

+ better than expected fuel economy
+ good power and a stable transmission
+ roomy cabin with lots of creature comforts
+ comfortable seating
+ ample middle-seat room and comfort
+ Ford's dual sun visor system
+ clean dash with readable layout

<i>Stuck in neutral:</i>

= lackluster ride
= a sound system that's non-remarkable
= adherence to the ford "oval" motif in interior design

<i>On the negative side</i>, the Expedition lacks useful cargo space when the third seat is in place. While the passenger cabin floor is not abnormally high (the 2WD version has surprisingly low ground clearance), the captain's chairs make entry and exit difficult. Being of average height and agility, I found that the running boards were a hindrance instead of a help. The high profile makes the vehicle handle poorly with a crosswind; the Expedition mostly handles like an overweight pickup to begin with
 
<i>The brake pedal:</i>

- clunky optional running boards
- easily effected by crosswinds
- integrated A/C and airflow control; no discrete on-off switch
- side-to-side sway on uneven surfaces
- massive size (76" tall, 78" wide, 205" long)
- limited cargo space with third seat in place
- difficult access to rear seat


<b>The Recommendation</b>

If one is convinced that he or she needs a vehicle of this size, I'd say this one's quite probably a winner. Before you buy, however, look long and hard at your actual needs. As equipped, the vehicle sells for $33,165 -- a great deal of money to pay for a vehicle that doesn't meet your needs. You will not, I wager, carry lumber to build a deck in this thing*, nor will you take six passengers and all their luggage on a cross-country vacation unless you use the roof rack or pull a fifth wheel.

I'm personally opposed to the SUV phenomenon, but don't let that influence my recommendation. As SUVs go, this one is above average. As vehicles go, this one is below average. I give it good marks on comfort and quality, and it appears to have a well-designed power train. On the other hand, I feel that a vehicle this massive should have more cargo space, and I remain unimpressed by the ride. 

That's my story, and I'm sticking to it... 



<i>* On Saturday, I watched a woman cautiously loading a half-dozen or so ten-foot deck boards into her full-size SUV. She had them resting on a quilt folded over the tailgate so as not to scratch her finish, and had the other end wrapped in a sheet and resting on the console. Me, I'd have just tossed 'em in the pickup bed, tacked a red flag on the end, and driven off. I had to giggle...</i>
