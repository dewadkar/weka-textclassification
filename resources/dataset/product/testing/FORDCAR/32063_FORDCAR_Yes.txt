            When my daughter was born we had a two-door, front seat only truck. My husband adored it but clearly, it was getting just a tad bit cramped when Emily came into the picture. I always felt uneasy about her being in the front seat with us, but since there wasn't a back seat and we didn't have the money for a larger vehicle, there wasn't much we could do. Grocery shopping had to be done on only good-weather days and whenever we bought something it rode up front with us. 

Last September we decided to see if we could finance something bigger, so we went to our local Chevy/Ford dealership and checked out the SUV's. We were approved, miraculously enough, but not without a ton of finangling. The bad news: our monthly payments would be higher and we had to buy used BUT...we could now buy something bigger. 

My husband often reads the Consumer Reports and told me that the Ford Explorer ranked number three on the list of safest SUV's. This definitely put it in the running for our next vehicle. It was between a 1996 metallic red four-door Explorer and a black Chevy Blazer (which ranked 13, I believe). 

Well, the Explorer won and now, nine months later, we are expecting our second child who will be able to sit in his carseat next to his big sister quite comfortably. Our trunk space holds our daughter's stroller, our groceries, pool items and various odds and ends. We are still sitting up fairly high (although not as much as my husband would prefer, being used to a big truck previously)and don't burn gas as fast as we did with the truck (a definite bonus when you like to get out a lot). It rides smoothly and sits five comfortably, with plenty of leg room.
