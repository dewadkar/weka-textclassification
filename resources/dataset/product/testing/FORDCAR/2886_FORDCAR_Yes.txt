            I have my Ford Escort for 7 years now, and I love it. While it certainly can't be called the best car made by Ford, it still has a lot of useful features and such that makes me recommend it to people. 

My car's version is a station wagon, making it pretty roomy all around. The car is relatively small but is large enough to fit 4 people and a large dog (a bit cramped however). Not as useful as a van or such for groups, but not small enough that you just cannot fit that many people in it. The cargo area it small  and doesn't really help for trips but you can probably fit your stuff in the back. 

The mileage of this car is great, and maintaining it is easy. I didn't have to take it into the shop too much and when I did, it never was anything serious. 

This is a very nice family car that I can recommend to many. It is easy to maintain and has good gas mileage combined with sporty looks and a nice feel which make it a very good car.<br><br>
