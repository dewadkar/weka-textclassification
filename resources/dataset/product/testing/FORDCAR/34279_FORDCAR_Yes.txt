                     I enjoy my Ford truck for work and for family driving. I bought the f-150 supercab 4x4 series. I needed a truck durable for work ,yet comfortable for family driving. It is great for hauling fairly heavy loads such as wood, furniture, appliances. Some smaller trucks do not have that capability. They can only handle small loads. Compared to Chevy and Dodge the Ford drives smooth and is easy to operate. It is also gets better gas mileage than them. The four wheel drive is a must have in the snowy conditions. Two wheel drive trucks are much harder to drive in the winter without weight in the back. I didn't have too put weight in the back of my F-150. It drives like a champ in any weather condition. The main thing that turns me off though is the price. It has an expensive price tag. Also the brakes seem to wear out quickly. But overall i would recommend this truck to just about anyone.That is if you are comfortable driving a full size truck.   I wouldn't recommend it to elderly people because it would be hard for them to climb in it.<br><br>
