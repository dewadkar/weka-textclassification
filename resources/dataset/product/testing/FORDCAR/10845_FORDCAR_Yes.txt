            We just bought our Ford Windstar about  4 months ago. And we love it. I have to transport daycare kids and take my kids to and from dance lessons, karate lessons, boy scouts, etc.. And there is ample room for friends to come along. I love the fact that you have two different controls for the rear air and front air. My kids and I dont agree on the temp. The built in car seats in the middle seating section are very handy with my daycare. I don't have to purchase more seats for these guys. They just pull down and buckle in. And they are safe and secure without the heavy bulky regular care seats. Then when you are done with them. You just raise them up and they go flush with the back of the seat. You dont even feel them or see them when they are closed. The rear seat folds down for hauling things. I have used this more than once when going on long trips or coming from Sams bringing home food. I highly recommend this  vehicle. The only problem is they all seem to ahve a problem witht he rear door sensor not working right. Therefore your rear light stays on from time to time thinking that your door is open.<br><br>
