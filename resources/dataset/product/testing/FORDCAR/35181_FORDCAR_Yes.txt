            We bought this car back in the summer. It had gotten to the point that we didn't have anything dependable. My husband travels to work every day and
we needed something dependable. We had gone shopping for something new. 
I had looked at other cars. But when I had test drive this car I liked it
When you put your foot on the accelerator it has such a good get-up-and- go when with todays traffic every car needs. It is comfortable for long trips that we need to make. The gas mileage is good. About 31 miles per gallon. It also is good for our daughter to drive. <br><br>
