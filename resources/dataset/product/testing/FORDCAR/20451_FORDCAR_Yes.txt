            When my boyfriend first suggested getting a Ford <b>(DIESEL)</b> I was not pleased.  My family has always had a Chevy/GMC thing over Fords.  I have heard stories about how horrible the gas mileage is that they get, how the paint fades, etc.  <p>We drove from PA to IL to get this truck and let me tell ya I was even more angry about the purchase-to-be because of the long ride.  I hate to travel.  My feelings changed when I rode in this brute of a truck.  The truck rides very smoothly and it is very roomy!  The 7.3 L Turbo Diesel engine gets very good gas mileage for a truck due to a chip my boyfriend bought after getting the Ford which makes it all the better.  The interior is the beautiful Lariat Leather.  The truck is fully loaded and has had no problems with any electrical stuff since we bought it six months ago.  This is a very heavy duty nice vehicle for someone who wants a truck <i>and</i> a blazer.<p>The only drawbacks that I have noticed is that in the <b>winter</b> it doesn't do so well in 2 Wheel Drive due to the heavy weight of the truck.  Hills can be very hard to climb and it may not move very well in a foot of snow.  Thanks to the trusty 4 Wheel Drive this really isn't a problem.  It also requires about ten bucks more than other trucks to change the oil due to being a diesel. <p>One experience to share is that my boyfriend let a friend borrow it <b>once</b> and he had it in a ditch.  The ditch was very, very deep and it climbed right out of it.  What we learned from that was the truck is very powerful and to never let a "friend" borrow something expensive. :)
