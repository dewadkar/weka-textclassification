            I found a used '98 ZX2, after my Tracker got totaled, for just under $9k. Credit life and a 6_year/100,000 warranty. Although it's a little cramped inside, it's a fun car to drive. Plenty of zip for getting in and out of Houston traffic, handles well (a little body roll; stiffer struts and sway bars may help), and looks pretty cool. Mine came with the CD player(although I need to take it in to get it worked on) and moonroof. I get right at 33 mpg highway and around 27 mpg city with a 12 gallon tank. It's a good car for commuting, although it gets a little tiresome on longer (200-mile) trips. Road noise, mainly wind, makes highway travel a little uncomfortable, too. The fold-down rear seats come in handy, especially if you mount a bike rack on the trunk, making it possible to access the trunk. Mine has the 5-speed standard transmission, giving the car a little edge against an auto tranny as well as better mileage, too. Gauges are easy to read, and controls are simple. God car for a college student or commuter, or if you just wanna look cool.
