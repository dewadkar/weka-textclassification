            I commute over a hundred miles a day for work, therefore I needed to have a reliable car. When I turned 18, I decided to purchase a 1996 Grand Am. I really enjoyed the car, however by 1999, I had 85,000 miles on the car. The blue book was $4,500, however I owed $10,000. 

My boss, being the type of guy who works with numbers all day, made it clear to me that I had two options. I could pay off my Grand Am (quickly), and until then risk being involved in a car accident where the car got totaled. It would then be my responsibility to pay off the difference in the loan. My other option was to buy a new car, if I could find someone to allow me to roll over upwards of $5,000. Ford Credit did it, and I've got a 1999 Ford Escort ZX2. 

What a sporty little car!? I don't get extraordinary gas mileage (30mpg), however the 2.6(?) liter engine has some get up and go! I've got a 10 disk cd changer, moon roof, power everything, the premium wheels and sound package, and it's the Sport model. Sticker on the car was $15,500, but I got it for around $14. 

I get a lot of compliments on the way the car looks, and I haven't had a single problem with it. It's got 20,000 and I've only taken it in for oil changes. 

I was amazed at how well it handled in the winter months. That is extremely important for a young lady driving in excess of 100 miles a day for work. 

As for bad qualities, it could be slightly more comfortable to drive. There is no arm rest for the driver's right arm. There isn't a lot of places to store things (ie: change holder). I rarely have any problems with my back on long trips, where as before I got this car, I would. I don't recommend the ZX2 model to anyone who has children, however I don't recommend any two-door vehicle to people with children! :)

All in all - I recommend the Ford Escort ZX2! :) Drive safe!<br><br>
