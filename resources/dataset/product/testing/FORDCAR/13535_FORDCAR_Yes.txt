            I purchased a 1999 Ford Explorer Limited this summer.  I just returned from a trip  with it  from Wisconsin to  California.  I pulled a trailer, and ran into a snow storm in New Mexico.  The all wheel drive was really nice on the slippery roads, and the many standard features were very nice to have on a long trip.  I thought the gas mileage was acceptable, but I would have liked to do a little better than 14 MPG.  Considering that I did haul a classic car back to Wisconsin, I felt that 14 MPG was acceptable.  I especially like the heated seats, as I do have back problems, ant this feature makes traveling long distances very comfortable.  Also the automatic dimming rear-view mirror is nice to have for night traveling.  
     I now have almost 20,000 miles on my Explorer, with no problems of any kind.  It has been a pleasure to drive an all kinds of weather, and road conditions. The 5-0 V-8 engine is very responsive and makes passing cars great.
    I would recommend this Ford to anyone who has to  haul thing.. (trips to the store, camping etc.) with the rear seats easily folding down for a large storage area.  This Explorer is great also for Wisconsin winters, not having to worry about shifting it into 4-wheel drive, and then back out again.<br><br>
