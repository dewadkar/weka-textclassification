            So how does the Explorer stack up as an 8 year-old used vehicle?  Using my recently purchased 96 XLT, 2WD, V8, with 102K miles as an example....very well it seems. 

Even with 102K on the clock, the body is tight, handling and ride are smooth and predictable, and the interior is not falling apart.  This vehicle has a very typical maintenance history of regular oil changes, replacement of worn out parts, and some electrical glitches (mostly windows).  The A/C compressor was replaced at 90K. 

Despite spending most of its life outside, the paint is still glossy, the trim is corrosion free, and the sunroof doesn't leak.  There are no cracks in plastic pieces, except the headlights which are still crazed & slightly yellow even after buffing.  They can be replaced for $90.00 using aftermarket units on Ebay.

The drivetrain is tight and leak free.  Really....no drips at all.  Very impressive.  The 5.0 V8 is a perfect fit for this 2-ton vehicle, although maintenance access is not as easy as the 4-liter V6 or 4.6 V8 in later models.  This Explorer has the trailer package, including limited slip.  The extra tranny cooler adds much to the vehicle's durability.   

It has 3 year-old Michelins (235/75-15) that have about 60% tread left and are wearing perfectly.  Also very impressive.  Front end linkages and joints are all tight.  The steering is dead center with no shakes.

You will not hear me complain about fuel mileage here.  This is a big 4,000 lb. vehicle with a V8 engine.  I'll gladly take the hit at the gas pump for the great power this engine provides.

Also, the Explorer safety issue is bogus, IMHO.  These are trucks, not race cars.  If you run your tires at 20 lbs. pressure (or less!!), overloaded on a 90 degree day,  
guess what?  they will pop!  Explorers are no more dangerous than any other vehicle with a higher than average center of gravity.  I'm sorry Ford took such a hit on this issue basically because of owner ignorance and neglect.  

This is just one Explorer, so your results may vary, but much of the great condition of this SUV can be attributed to good design and build quality.  Certainly good maintenance helps, so if you're shopping Explorers in this year and price range (under $8,000), do your homework on the candidate you choose, be careful and you will most likely get a good used SUV value.
