            <b>Updated Jan 16, 2004:  RIP to my beloved Probe.  Taken out by a pothole on a dark, winter road after 282,000 reliable miles.  The engine damage cannot be repaired.  Rebuilt engines are not available, and a new one would cost $5,000.  I am truly saddened at the loss of my old friend.</b>


I'm one of those stereotypical women who doesn't know (or care to know) more than the absolute minimum about automobiles.  What I value is ease of performance, reliability, and perhaps just a tad of snob appeal.  I want a car that meets my needs and requires little more than filling the gas tank and conducting routine maintenance chores.  My 1993 Ford Probe SE, purchased new at an end-of-the-model-year sale, has always been that kind of a car.  

After 7-plus years and 215,000 miles of local commuting in the Washington, D.C. area, the Probe remains an exciting and reliable vehicle.  In terms of major repairs, it has required a clutch replacement (largely because of its owner's heavy foot) and some relatively minor transmission work--less than $2,000 all told.  

As important to me, my Probe has been a joy to drive.  I like the sense of control provided by a manual transmission, plus the ease of driving provided by automatic steering.  My little black Probe gives me both.  It also gives me cruise control when I want it, and an instrument panel that even I find sensible.  The front-wheel drive is reliable on wet roads, and considering its size and weight, it even has reasonable control in the snow.  The long, low design of the body allows for unimpaired vision in all directions, except perhaps straight up--and that too might have been provided had I opted for a sunroof.

The engine is quiet and responds quickly to my wishes.  Don't ask me about 0-to-60 capabilities.  I'm sure they're impressive (or at least acceptable), but they remain among those details I don't really care about.  I'm not a spitfire on the highway, so as long as it moves out smartly when the light changes, I'm happy.

Gas mileage is another of those performance factors I can only guess at, as I wouldn't bother to keep track unless I suspected that something was amiss.  I know my car has a 12-gallon tank, and I know that my commute to and from work is 88 miles--over both rural and urban roadways.  I can make three and a half round trips to the office, plus a bit of local marketing, between fill-ups.  Based on that, I'd estimate my mileage (using medium grade unleaded gas) at about 30 miles per gallon.
 
Having previously owned a couple of Toyotas, an Audi, and a Volvo, the Probe is the first American-made car I've ever driven.  I admit to being a bit of a foreign-car addict, and I never thought that an American car could hold the slightest attraction.  The Probe's Mazda engine was thus a major hook in getting and keeping my attention back in 1993.  The sporty European design also appealed strongly.  

Don't misunderstand.  My Probe isn't perfect.  By purchasing the SE model instead of the more option-laden GT, I missed out on a CD player to go along with my tapedeck and AM/FM radio.  I also missed out on the jazzier control panel (which is really no great loss in my book).  Most important of all, though, I missed out on the one item every commuter really needs:  a cup holder.  Finally, I should note that the small back seat isn't terribly useful or comfortable for an adult passenger--especially over a serious distance.  

All things considered, I'm happy with my Probe.  I hope it endures yet another 7 years!  If so, I'll be sure to write a followup for Epinions.
