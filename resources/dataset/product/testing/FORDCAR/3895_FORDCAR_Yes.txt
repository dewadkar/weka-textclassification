            I have owned my Focus now for a little over 3 months and I love it.  You know on those commercials they show the family going over, I think it was railroad tracks, and the grandmother is holding a cup of tea and it did not spill.  Well, it did not lie my focus has enough shock protection to go through the deepest potholes with ease.  Now I know a lot of people have these biases against owning a Ford and so did I until I drove this car, it handled so smooth and nice and the gas milage is outstanding.  I can drive almost 400 miles before I have to fill up again, which is nice when my job is driving all around town.  This car is definely economical and sturdy.
I also found that unlike most compact cars, this Focus is very roomy.  I am a very tall girl ( 5'11) and I don't even touch the roof, I have plenty of room for my giant legs and feet to move around which is suprising for me since mine is manual transmission.  The trunk is also huge and can fit 4 regualr size tires in it.  The Focuses also come with an excellent bumper to bumper warrenty as well as nice rebates and insentive packages.  The car is also a very competive price.  My Focus cost me a little over $11,000 after rebates and it is fully loaded with every little feature you need.  Child locks, airbags, power windows and locks, tilt steering, power steering, cruise control and climate control, heated seats and much more.  now I don't know a lot about car, I won't lie to you, but I feel like I got a great deal on my car and it is perfect for me and my life syle.
