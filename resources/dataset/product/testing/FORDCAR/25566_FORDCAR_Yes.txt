            The new Sport Trac is an ideal multi utility vehicle. I did however find the bucket seats very uncomfortable. The vertical rise of the side bolsters was too high and sharp. It was like sitting on two rails. My local dealer graciously had the problem resolved by removing the leather seat covers and tapering the bolster at an angle. The wedge that was cut off of the inside edge of the bolster was then glued to the outside of the bolster to accommodate the otherwise surplus fabric in the cover, making it wider with a less radical rise. The seat now looks like, and in fact is as comfortable as, any luxury SUV bucket seat.<br><br>
