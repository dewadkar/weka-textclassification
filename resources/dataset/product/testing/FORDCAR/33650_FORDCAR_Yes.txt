             I own a 1998 FORD escort ZX2. It is a year and a half old! It has been a great car. I now have 36000 miles on it, with not one problem. It has very good power, and is easy to drive! I own 7 cars, age from 1970 to 1998. it is one of the best cars i have ever own. It is a very good car to drive to work, but i would not buy this car for a family, it is just too small.
