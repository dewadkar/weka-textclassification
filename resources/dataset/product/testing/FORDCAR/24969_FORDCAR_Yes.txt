            The Mustang is a very attractive car, but how powerful is it and how's it's performance?  Is it comfortable to drive?  And most importantly, is it fun to drive?

After an accident I bought a 1989 BMW 325is.  This following my ownership of a Mazda RX7 which I loved.  But after my experience in the accident I decided I wanted a larger car.  The BMW didn't please me because it just wasn't a sports car, even though it was sporty.  When I started looking again, I wanted a sports car.  I decided on the Mustang because of it's affordability in a new vehicle, it's newer, more attractive style, it's power, and also it's slightly larger size.

My mustang does not have the Mach stereo system, and I must say the system it does have is quite weak, something I personally plan to rectify soon.  However, as a 5'5&quot; woman I find the seats amazingly comfortable, and while I wouldn't call it roomy, my 6' boyfriend fits comfortably in the front seat.  The back seat is perfect for my child.  I bought the GT Coupe and I recommend the leather (better for children who are constantly finding stains around themselves--leather doesn't stain).

The power of the Mustang V8 is very pleasing, it offers all speed demons like myself all the power and performance we might want.  The gas petal is very touchy though and takes some getting used to.  I would recommend you go out and show the Mustang's skills off to your friends as much as possible to get a little practice handling a heavier car.  Although it is heavier, this gives the car more stability, and does not seem to detract from cornering or taking off at your speed of choice.

By no means is the Mustang a comfort sedan, and if you don't want to feel and hear the road under you, then it is not the car for you. However if you feel the need for speed and do not want to spend $60,000.00, the mustang is a blast to drive.

One of my favorite features--the choice of an automatic.  I have an automatic and while to most sports car enthusiasts automatic transmissions are only for the Grandmas, the Mustang's V8 automatic is a viable choice because the effect on performance and control is negligble, and the automatic transmission is easier on your legs in rush home traffic.<br><br>
