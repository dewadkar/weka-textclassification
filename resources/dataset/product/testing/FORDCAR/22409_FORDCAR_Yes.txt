            The 1999 ford escort zx2 two door coupe is a great car to have.  This is a very nice car with a very low sticker price.  My parents bought one for traveling and now i find that I drive that more than I drive my own car.  It has a lot of options to it.  It is very good on gas mileage.   As a matter of fact there is only one thing wrong with this car, and that is the seats.  it is a subcompact car, but I would consider it a really compact car when you sit in it.  The back seats are pretty small.  To me a car need to have good heat in the winter and good air condtioning in the summer.  So far it is great in the winter for warming up in a short period of time.  It really doesn't need that many repairs at all just standard routine maintaince.<br><br>
