            My wife and I have been shopping around for a new vehicle. We finally chose the Ford Expedition XLT. Well we continued shopping around anyway and put in a price quote with carorder.com. They said they could put me in an Expedition (Eddie Bauer) for 32,200. When we went to the dealership, they were having a Truck/SUV sale. We saw the Explorer Limited Edition and took a GOOD look at it. It had everything that we wanted and more. It even had more than the Expedition. We decided to take it for a test drive. It surprised us that the salesman didn't go with us. He didn't ask for our address, phone number or anything. All he said was &quot;bring it back when you're done.&quot; WOW.
Well, my wife and I both had a chance to drive it and we were more than impressed. This SUV had EVERYTHING. It even has a message recorder on the drivers side sun visor so my wife can leave me voice messages such as &quot;don't forget to pick up Kotex on the way home from work&quot; YUCK (lol).
Well, we decided that we liked this vehicle much better than the Expedition that we had looked at even though it was more expensive (about $5,000 more). Anyway, we decided to do the paperwork on it and were pleasantly surprised. With the trade-in on our existing truck ($7,500), the factory rebate ($1,000), and the down payment ($1,000) we could get into this SUV for about $27,500. WOW again. We are just waiting on the word now to come pick it up.
This vehicle is very pleasant to drive and has plenty of room for the kids AND cargo.
All in all, this a perfect vacation, business, or family car.<br><br>
