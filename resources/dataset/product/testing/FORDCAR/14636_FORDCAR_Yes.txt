            I love my new Focus Wagon!  From the moment I sat down in the car I knew it was the one I was going to buy.  The 6-disc cd changer is fun and convenient.  I also got leather seats and side-impact airbags, making me feel like I'm in a luxury car, but staying under $20,000.  There are pockets all over the place, in the doors, the back of the seats, and even small pockets in the front of the seats.  I was really surprised by all of the little features that make the car so comfortable.

I'm 5'4", and in many cars the seat belt doesn't sit well on my shoulder (even if the height is adjustable).  The adjustment on the Focus is wonderful.  I was able to adjust the belt perfectly.  There's also a height adjustment for the seat, so you can determine how high you want to sit.  Also, the steering wheel not only adjusts up and down, but adjust for depth as well. This is a great feature for me, since I have to sit close to the foot pedals, but don't need the steering wheel right up against me.

Once I started driving, I was surprised how quiet the car was.  I could hardly hear the engine at all!  We also took it on the highway, and the response was excellent!  I had no trouble with acceleration, and the handling is great.  

The cruise control has 5 buttons, and took me a minute to figure out.  Also, I take toll roads to work, and the cruise control accelerates too fast for me when I hit the resume button (going from 40 to 75mph).  It still gest a lot of use from me, as my commute is mostly highway.  

The trunk space is <b>WONDERFUL</b>!  I was able to fit in my big, bulky stroller, and still have plenty of room for groceries.  It has more room that a lot of suv's that I've seen, and I haven't been able to fill it yet.  

I've had the car for about a month as I write this, and I'm very happy with it.  If I decide to go with a newer car in the future, I could see myself in the same model again.
