             I bought a 1991 Ford Taurus, 2nd Hand of course. It was garage Kept and in perfect condition. I bought it because I had heard From A Friend That It Was A Very Reliable Car And It Also Has Plenty Pick up to it. I Love the Rack in Pinion steering, and the Handling of the car. My car has the Premium wheels, bigger Engine, loaded. Red interior, White / Silver exterior. However the Ford Taurus has been known for Bad engine Mounts and Transmissions going bad in them. However these problems are Not all that bad they may turn you from purchasing this vehicle. However I fully recommend this car to any family and / or Anyone. Plenty of Head room along with plenty of leg and Shoulder room. I Highly recommend this dependable inexpensive Car. I Love it and I am sure you will also.
