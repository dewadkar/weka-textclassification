            We bought our Ford Explorer XLT after we found out we were expecting our second child.  During the selection process, we discovered the Explorer to be a roomier, more reasonably priced SUV than some of the major competition.

With two small children who still ride in carseats, we needed more room than what we could get with the average-size family car.  We also needed storage for a double stroller, diaper bags, toys, and groceries, etc. Living in Missouri during the long winter months also provided a need for the 4WD feature.  After test-driving several sport-utility-vehicles and mini-vans, this Explorer was the best option for us.  Compared to the other similar sport-utility vehicles, there was far-more storage space due to the fact that the spare-tire rides underneath the vehicle.  Also, there was tons more head room and passenger room in the front.  The separate heat/cooling options for the back make our children more comfortable as well.  The 4wd is super-easy to use, and we have used it a lot during the winter months.  

The one major drawback to this particular vehicle is it rides a bit rougher than the other sport-utilities that we tested.  The ride is more like a truck than a passenger car, but the roomier seating, head room, and storage more than make up for this disadvantage.<br><br>
