            The Beach Boys really knew what they were talking (or singing!) about when they said the T-Bird was &quot;fun, fun, fun.&quot; Even if I DIDN'T live near the beach in Fort Lauderdale, I would love to cruise around town in my silver Thunderbird!

Believe it or not, I DIDN'T buy this car... it was a gift from some special friends (yah, VERY special, huh?)! But after driving this one I WOULD buy one in the future!

Whether in heavy city traffic or on the freeway, my T-bird drives very nicely and has so much &quot;pep&quot; that I have to watch very carefully to &quot;keep the foot off the pedal&quot; and not land myself in trouble! It drives so smoothly that driving at 60-65 MPH actually FEELS more like 45! Got to keep that eye on the speedometer driving this thing, or you'll end up with a ticket! :-)

The seats are very comfortable, with plenty of leg room (I'm tall). Back seat also has quite a bit of leg room and is comfortable. Good circulation of air conditioner, even in back seat.

One thing I especially like about this car is that it &quot;turns on a dime.&quot; This is especially helpful if you life in the city and frequently need to make turns in small spaces or U-turns (yes, it's LEGAL in Fort Lauderdale!)  :-)  Even though it's a bit larger car than I'm used to, I find it as easy to drive as the smaller models.

Maybe I am showing my age :-)  but the only type of person I would NOT recommend the Thunderbird for is someone who lacks the discipline and self-control to drive it right! Speeders and &quot;rage-aholics&quot; etc., had best stick with something a bit more sedate. But otherwise -- if you want a &quot;dream car&quot; -- this is it!!<br><br>
