            To all you chaperoning parents; here's the ticket! A van that rides like a Lincoln with the roominess of a stretch limousine - the Ford Econoline, E-150 Conversion model(with 5 children and a dog we had to have something more than a Chevy Cavalier). We couldn't be happier. This is the second conversion van we've owned and the upgrades since the first one are impressive. Captain seats, blinds, fold-down couch, sleek running boards, stylish detailing, and the T.V./VCR make this van truly a family vehicle. Compared to the Ford Windstar (the van we owned before this one), this van beats it hands down. For almost $4000 less than the Windstar (same year) you get twice the space and triple the features. As most parents know, the biggest headache is the long drive to your child's sports event. Not any more; now we just put a tape in the VCR and ride in blissful entertainment. (We eagerly anticipate a spring trip to Florida...). The only drawback is the gas consumption. If that matters more than all the other advantages, don't purchase one of these. We average 15-20 miles per gallon (and 20 is with the wind at our back, going downhill!).  All in all, our family wouldn't trade this vehicle for love or money! Get one!<br><br>
