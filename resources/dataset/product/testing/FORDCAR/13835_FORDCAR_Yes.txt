            The Contour is probably more car for the dollar than you are going to find anywhere else. I wouldn't call anything about the Contour &quot;inspired&quot; -- but given the fact that you can pick one up a 98 used for 10K or so, it's very hard to complain.

The car has great room for the front passengers, but limited room in the back seat - which is what you would expect from Ford's &quot;premium compact car&quot;. The ride is solid, but not exciting - which is what you would expect from a car that doesn't pretend to be a sports car. The trunk room is awesome - much more than you would expect in a compact.

All of the controls and accessories are well laid out, with the notable exception of the cup holders, which are kind of tucked behind the gear shift on the automatic - not easy to get to at all. I have the SE, which has just the right amount of toys - power windows, power locks, tilt, AC, etc, etc, and it all works great.

The car has seen more than it's share of recalls, but they have all been pretty minor - so minor, in fact, that I'm kind of amazed Ford bothered with some of them. I can't fault Ford at all for their after sale care.

Looking through other opinions, I notice that one person complained about the gas tank being impossible to fill, that the pump keeps kicking off every 20 cents or so when filling up. This is probably due to bad valve in the filler neck of the gas tank. Mine had the same problem. This valve is actually part of the emission control system, and Ford will fix this on warranty with not problem. 

I also saw that one opinion writer complained about vibration. I'll admit that the road noise is a bit more than I think it ought to be, but vibration is nothing I've experienced. If anything, the ride is much smoother than you would expect in a car in this price range.

I bought my Contour used in 1998 - it is the 1998 model year, and I bought it at the end of the year. It had 18000 miles on it from serving as a rental car, so you know it was driving hard and beat up as much as possible. Since then, I've put another 18000 miles on it, and the thing is just absolutely reliable. Never ever hard to start, never ever a hassle of any kind whatsoever. 

If you're in the 10 to 12K price range, I think you couldn't do better than to pick up one of the excellent cars. Don't expect to be thrilled with its styling or performance, but you won't be disappointed in any way at all. <br><br>
