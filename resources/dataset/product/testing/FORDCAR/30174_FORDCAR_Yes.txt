Ford Escape 2002.

For 2002 the Ford Escape has been declared the best in its class for interior space and the best in its class for passenger comfort and room. 

At first I thought that the Escape would simply be a mini-Explorer but once I saw and had the opportunity to drive it I then realized that this SUV had a character of its own. 

As Ford promised this baby sport utility vehicle does handle very well, they say like a car, I think this is a bit far fetched but it will give you a smoother ride than most SUVs and will offer the Escape owners some of the benefits of a SUV. 

The interior of the Escape is very well designed and it is also in the interior and mostly on the driver side dashboard that it resembles the most to an Explorer. Once I sat behind the steering wheel, I felt as if I was sitting in my Explorer all controls are located at the same place and they are all easy to reach. 

Although the Escape is suppose to be a diminutive SUV the front occupants will have more than enough room and as for the rear cabin there is sufficient space for the passengers to be comfortable and the cargo area is also large enough and comparable to the Explorer. 

It is evident that Ford designed the Escape to appeal to younger generation, and I think they will succeed. You could say that it has an "urban cool" look to it.


The durable plastic front and rear bumpers gives an The new owners will also be offered a selection of bright and lively colors to choose from. The one I drove was a bright yellow, surrounded by soft Grey side panels and bumpers. It certainly was eye catching and head turning, the ideal for those who want to be noticed. 

The Ford Escape is equipped with a V-6, 3.0 liters engine that will develop 201 horsepower. The transmission is a 5-speed automatic 4 wheel drive. It came equipped with an Anti-lock breaking system. The Ford Escape will do 22 miles per gallon in the city and 26 on the highway.
