            I was a single mom looking for a decent car to get to and from nursing school, and ended up buying a 1991 Ford Escort Pony (the most basic form of transportation you can buy short of a Yugo). The price was right ($65 a month and $65 a month in insurance----combined less than most people pay for a car payment alone). I only had it for a year, but it was the best car I owned. I am not a big fan of Ford because I have owned cars made by them before that have given me nothing but headaches, but I will give them credit for the Escort Pony. 
It was destroyed when a woman ran a stop sign and hit it on the front end....when the insurance company paid it off I was upset....it was worth a lot more to me than what it's book value stated. I will say this...she hit me at 35mph with a mini-van and the car held up pretty well for it's size.
The gas mileage on them is unbelievable too....with gas prices skyrocketing, I wish I still had my Escort now. I could travel too and from school and work all week on one tank of gas, and even from almost dead empty the gas pump stopped at under $15.
It did not have any great extras like power steering, but it was the best car I have ever owned for New England winter driving. When it got smashed it had 140,000 on it and was still running like new..it always started, and never once stalled out on me.
It was not the fastest thing on four wheels, but is definitely one of the most reliable. I would recommend the Ford Escort (Pony or other models from 1991 to anyone).<br><br>
