            This past summer i bought my 1999 Ford Ranger extended cab off road truck.  I am pleasantly surprized with it's options and handling ability.  My truck is fully loaded with all the options and is manuel and i love it.  It handles great on all the turns and since it is a V-6 i have plenty of power for all my needs.  The 4x4 is great in the winter and whenever i am hauling or off-roading.  If you are looking for a truck that isn't huge but has all the power you would need, the Ranger is the way to go.  The ride is quite smooth considering it is a pick-up. The only downfall that i have found is that the seats in the extended cab area are tight.  You surely would not want to make someone travel back there for long.  <br><br>
