            We purchased a 2001 Ford Explorer Limited no more than 6 months ago. WE LOVE IT!! its a wonderful car for yourself or for a family! It rides great, and it appears it will forever.  On the scale of SUV's the Ford Explorer Limited is in the upper half on the price range, but dont worry you get what you paid for.  This SUV is one of the best on the market, we have owned a montero sport by mitsubishi and we have also owned a Jimmy by GMC.  None of these cars compare to the quality and reliability to the Ford Explorer Limited.  And dont worry this car looks great too, very stylish, everyone will want to ride in your FORD.  
        We have been very happy with the car.  The Ford Explorer Limited comes with anything and everything there really isnt anything that you cant get on this car that you can on another.  The only system that this car would be even better with is Northstar or one of the satelite directional things.  Anyways the 4WD is excellent especially if you are more of the offroading person or just live in a more winter setting with snow. It has been battle tested on ice and snow where i live so no need to worry.  On the new version on the steering wheel you can control just about every feature of the car, there are buttons for the air, radio, cruise control, lights, and thats all i can think of.  One of my favorite options on this car has to be the Heated Seats that are of great use during the winter of just whenver you are cold, the heat in the seats gets up in full blast within seconds.   The SUV comes with a great 8 speaker BOSE audio system, this system will suit rap music to country music.  A couple of other features with this car is a 5 cd disc changer and a single cd entrance on the main console, power seats, leather seats which i suggest getting in grey,sunroof, and  just about anything else you can imagine except the kitchen sink.

   There have been a few minor problems that we have noticed with this car, the biggest one is that the gas mileage really is not good its about 16 on the highway and 12 in the city, within the first month we had the car we had two broken front windowns, there was no object that hit the window it was just broken but Ford covered both, it was just a minor incovienence.  Also the sealent on the drivers side window started to come off which we had to get fixed.  One thing that hasnt been a problem but is kind of annoying is the rear wiper it seems that when you turn it off it is amazingly loud but i guess that is just me.  One thing i have really noticed is that this car is very loud, if you are coming from a large truck say the Expedition (which we also owned) or a smooth riding small car then you are going to have to take some time to get use to the noise, when you drive the car for the first month it seems like there is a big windstorm.  Once you have driven the car for a while you will get use to it.

Overall we have had a good experience in this car and we have been really happy in our decision to purchase this car.  If you are in the market for a new one, take it out for a test drive, i think you will be surprised!
