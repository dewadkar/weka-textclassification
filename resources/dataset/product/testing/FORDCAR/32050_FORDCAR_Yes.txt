            1996 Ford Explorer Sport: 4L V-6,2x4,AT,PS,PB,PL,PW,CC,AC,AM/FM/Cassette.

I purchased my Explorer in mid-97; it already had 30k miles.  It didn't take me long to change the stock tires to passenger car tires to improve the ride and lower the road noise.  The tire change did both.  I don't know if anyone else has experienced this but it would get loose in the front end when I hit any water on the road.  Very scary stuff.  The new tires helped that, too.

The Explorer offers all the utility and style I was seeking.  This thing is beautiful in the dark, sitting in the cockpit, with all the controls illuminated.  Everything is clearly visible, even the cruise controls on the steering wheel.  Ford did a great design job with layout and style.  The vehicle is sufficiently powered with the 4L V-6.

My Explorer now has 63k miles.  It's had standard regular maintenance but it has required no repairs.  The gas mileage has not been bad, I average about 20 MPG to a tank.  It's a little better on road trips.

There are some problem areas, mainly the seat belts.  The front passenger belt will engage (lock up) when you try to put it on.  Not everytime but often enough to be very aggravating.  The rear seat belts experience the same problem less often and they sometimes don't want to release when you press the button.  Being the procrastinator that I am, I have not had these problems looked at by Ford.

I would keep this truck for a long time if it had a factory moonroof, remote keyless entry, and CD player.  I cannot bring myself to alter the beautiful interior with an aftermarket stereo.<br><br>
