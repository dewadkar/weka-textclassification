            In 1997, my oldest son totaled my car - a 1993 black LeBaron convertible with literally option Chrysler offered. I was heartbroken. I loved that car! It handled well, it drove well, and it had everything.(And my son was uninjured, even though he was broadsided on the driver's door by a car going over 40 mph!)  However, I couldn't find another to replace it. 

I had to have a convertible, though, and I loved the looks of the new Mustang when it was released, so I test drove several (used). I ended up buying a 1996 V6 bright blue Mustang convertible. It was nice. It handled well, and it had decent power. But, it just wasn't the same as my LeBaron. I didn't grow attached. Good thing. My younger son totaled it 6 months after we got it!

Ironically, he was broadsided on the driver's door by a pickup truck going 45 mph. He walked away from the accident uninjured. That fact made me willing to buy another Mustang.

This time, we got it right. We got a black 1996 Mustang GT convertible with leather interior and all the toys. It handles well, it rides well, and boy does it have power. And I am very impressed with the excellent stopping distance. A car pulled out in front of me and I thought that I had no chance in the world of missing it - but the car stopped on a dime! 

We have had this car for 2 1/2 years without a repair - of course we only have 45,000 miles on it. 

I only have a couple of complaints. First, the motorized convertible top is SLOW! Second, the kind of tires you need to put on this car -&quot;Z&quot; rated tires - don't last more than about 20,000 miles and they are expensive! 

But, if you want a fun car to drive, with a back seat at least large enough for someone to sit in for a very short period of time, the GT model fits the bill. I cannot tell you how many people - perfect strangers - have complimented me on my car - workers at fast food drive-through windows - people at stop lights - people in the grocery store parking lot. 

I love it, my husband loves it, and my two sons want it.<br><br>
