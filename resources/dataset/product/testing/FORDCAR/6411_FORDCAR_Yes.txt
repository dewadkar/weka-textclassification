            Well my dad bought the 1990 Ford Aerostar in March of that year. I was only about 7 years old at the time and i loved it the day we got it. Now i am 18 and My dad has a new Windstar and i glady took over driving the Aerostar. I love this van. I like the design of the body because it doesnt look like a typical "carlike" minivan. Its body style is unique. The van is very reliable. It just crossed over 100,000 miles in September of 2000. I drive the van about 50 miles a day and it runs great. The only drawback is the lifter somehow became loose so it smacks into the top of the engine producing a loud ticking noise. This has been happening for about 3 years and the van still runs good. The v6 engine produces more power than most people think. The drive is comfortable, the seats are very nice and the height in the vehicle provides a good view of the road and traffic. Controls are very easy to reach and operate. The room is excellent, plenty of space for my picky passengers and plenty of legroom. Since i started driving the van i put about 10000 miles on it and not one thing has gone wrong. It is also a very tough van, Its been through allot and never falls apart or breaks down. It corners really well which helps in wet situations by allowing me to regain control quickly {sadly i learned that from experience.] I was very sad when i found out Ford stopped making them in 1997, because after this one i plan on owning another. My friends and i enjoy my van, we gave it a nickname T4. I recommend this vehicle to any family looking for a unique low priced minivan. If only Ford would restart production....

**UPDATE** Its now May of 2001, T4 is still around! Everyone said there is no way the van would reach 100K miles, it now has 107K and nothing has gone wrong with it for years [except the ticking engine.] I am now looking to fully restore the van.

**SECOND UPDATE** October 4th 2001 T4 was totaled in an accidnet. After realizing what the van went through i truly do give it credit for keeping me and my cousin alive. The van lost control and went into a telephone pole and then through a wooden fence and spun around several times. The structure of the van held well enough to make us walk away without a scratch. R.I.P T4....111067 miles and 11 yrs old.
