            Hello,

I love my Ford F-150 supercab.  The fourth door in the 99's was a wonderful idea.  I have had three F-150's and by far this on is my favorite.  It is so convenient to be able to go and open the doors from either side.  Packing and unpacking is so much better.  The only thing I can think of is the noise reduction needs to be worked on.  There is alot of noise driving down the highway.  I have had it checked out at the dealership and they have told me that is the truck.  Nothing is wrong as far as the truck goes.  Please make it a more quite ride for people that enjoy cruiseing down the highway listening to there music.  Also, the fold down console is not very convenient for your arms.  Make the console longer.  The fog lights are wonderful.  I have been able to get home at night many times with your fog lights. I lived fifty miles out of town in the mountains.  There were nights it was snowing so bad, I could not see the road in front of me.  The fog lights is what got me home.  I wouldn't have a truck without them. If anyone wants a wonderful truck, get yourself a Ford F-150 supercab.  You will wonder why you did not do it before now.
The seats are very comfortable but solid.  This makes for a long drive a very pleasant and comfortable drive.  Remember, drive a Ford F-150 and you will see what I am talking about. <br><br>
