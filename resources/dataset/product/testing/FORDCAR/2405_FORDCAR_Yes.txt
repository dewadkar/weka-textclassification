            Not a bad deal in a used truck.  The gas mileage is not what I'm used to at 12mpg (my 91 ranger 4x4 got 26mpg) good thing it has dual tanks.  Good running truck with a smooth ride for a large truck.  Roomy interior - don't like the factory cup holder - it is a pain if you want to put 3 men in the seat.  The factory sound system works well, the tuner really pulls in the distant stations.  The payload is awesome, I've already hauled over 3000# in one shot with no problems.  It is a strong towing vehicle.  Overall I like this truck.<br><br>
