            The 2000 Explorer is an excellent car.  It is built well, has a lot of power, is safe, and is very comfortable.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an SUV.   The ford that I own is a SOHC 4.0 v6 XLT four-door.  I chose not to get the V8 because it does not allow you to lock it into 4WD or a low range of gears.  I have had it since September and it has yet to see the dealership again.

PROS:

Well, where can I start?  The car has a lot of power, it is very reliable, and it is extremely comfortable.  People in the back seat are never cramped.  It rides very well and handles great without a &quot;top-heavy feeling&quot;.  The torsion bars in the front work great and is adjustable as well.  The back feels great and something that I discovered is that it has 3 shocks in the back.  2 are lateral and 1 is horizontal from the top of the differential to the frame.

CONS:

The only compliant that I have is the mileage.  It is not really bad but I would like it to be better.  I plan to help this with a better intake system and 16 inch rims.  Other than that, the car is great and I recommend it to all.

By the way, if anyone knows about performance part for this car please let me know.
