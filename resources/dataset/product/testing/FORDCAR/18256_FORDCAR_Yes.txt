            I have a 1991 Ford Escort LX; I'm 16 years old and this is my first car.  I totally recommend this vehicle.  Throughout the time I have had it, I haven't had any major problems, which is suprising considering the age of this car.  It's reliable and gets good gas mileage.  

This is the perfect car for a teenager.  For parents, it is a relief to know your child is protected and won't be broken down on the side of the road every other week.  It's an automatic and easy to drive and handle.  The only problem I have noticed is when the car reaches 65 miles per hour on the interstate.  It becomes a little jumpy and the steering loosens slightly.  But, my dad is basically a car expert and he believes this is nothing to worry about.

Buy this car - you will be happy you did!
