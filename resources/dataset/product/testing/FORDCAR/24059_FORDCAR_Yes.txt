            I purchased a 1997 Ford Expedition in January 2000.  I had wanted a SUV for years and could not afford one.  I was looking at  Chevy , but came across my Expedition and took it for a test drive.  It was love at first drive.  It has all the room that I need, but without the big size of a Chevy.  I have two children (girls) and spend a lot of time transporting them and their friends to and from places.  With all the room (front seat and two back seats) there is more than enough room for 8 persons, who can all ride without sitting on top of one another and having to share their thoughts with one another due to the massive space inside.  The ride is nice, and I like the feeling of being in a large vehicle, god forbid we are ever in an accident.  This vehicle is more visible to 18 wheelers and you don't feel as intimidated when passing or being passed by one.<br><br>
