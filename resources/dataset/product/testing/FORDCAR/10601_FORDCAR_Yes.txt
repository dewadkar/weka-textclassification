            I bought a 2000 Ford Ranger about a month ago. Be assured, however, this review is not written by somebody who has only appreciated this vehicle for 30 short days! I have also owned '97, '91, '84 and '83 Rangers in the past.

To start, the Ranger is a handsome truck from the outside. It looks like a truck that you could easily put to work, not just wax and drive on Saturdays. (No offense to Toyota, but I owned a 1990 Toyota Truck and I gotta say I wouldn't try to haul anything bigger or heavier than myself and a passenger in it. Flimsy sheet metal and other questionable material quality just too scary.) The 2 and 4-wheel drives all sit on big Firestone Wilderness 15&quot; tires. The doors shut with a satisfying 'clunk,' and everything from the door handles to the bumpers look like they're made to take a beating.

For the interior, Ford has chosen the &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; approach, utilizing the same dash that has graced the Ranger, Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer since 1995 (and inside reports have it staying in all these vehicles, as well as the Sport-Trac, well into 2003) The controls are placed just where they should be. Kudos for the easy to read radio and climate controls. All Rangers get 2 very usable cupholders on the center hump, and most have a handy storage compartment between the 2 VERY comfortable front seats. Dual airbags are standard, with a deactivation switch for the passenger side.

The major drawback to Ford's little hauler is the powertrain choices. Mine has the 2.5 liter inline 4-cylinder. I chose it because I only drive mine back and forth to work, rarely hauling anything in the bed. I have towed other cars, as well as hauled engines in it before, but I wouldn't recommend this engine AT ALL if you plan on working your truck daily. It gets great gas mileage, and does quite well for what I need though.

Do not, I say DO NOT choose the 3.0 liter V-6 unless you are a very successful, sexy, confident person and need some disappointment in your life. Not only does it average about 12-16 MPG (based on my personal experience) but I didn't find it to be any more powerful than my 4-cylinder. In fact, a 4WD (running in 2WD) with the A/C on seemed MORE sluggish than the 4 banger!

I guess the only real choice, if you have the money, is the 4.0 liter 6-cylinder. Now here we have a quick, powerful engine that gets as good or better MPG than the 3.0. It's perfect for hauling a load, or climbing a mountain. It really is a good engine on it's own, not just when shadowing the other 2 choices.

All in all, I'd recommend this truck to somebody in the market for a compact truck. If you're a contractor looking for a truck to bring to the site, for God's sake buy an F-350! But if you're an average Joe, looking for a stylish, practical truck for day to day chores and driving, Ford's got you covered!<br><br>
