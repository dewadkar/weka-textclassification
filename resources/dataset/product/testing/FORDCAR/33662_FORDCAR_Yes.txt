            About ten years ago I would not have been caught dead driving a Ford Escort.  They were the bottom of the food chain as far as I was concerned.  However, Ford again came up with a "better idea" and designed the Escort ZX2.

I bought my 1998 Escort ZX2 new after owning a 1989 Thunderbird for nine years.  I had prepared myself for a big adjustment but was pleasantly surprised.  I first chose the ZX2 because of its low price and sporty look.  When I test drove my car, I fell in love.  The four cylinder, front wheel drive car offered a smooth ride and was quick to pick up speed from stop signs.

After I bought the car and drove it on a daily basis, I enjoyed it even more.  The fuel mileage is excellent and after almost 26,000 miles the only repair I have had done is a cracked windshield.  The car still looks sharp, drives great, and offers a comfortable ride.

I would recommend the Escort ZX2 for a single person or a married couple with no more than one child.  The car has a fair amount of interior and trunk space.  However, riding with four adults in the car and the air conditioning on takes a definite toll on the power and fuel mileage.

The only thing I have found that I do not like about my car is the lack of a mirror on the sun visor.  Perhaps this has been added to the newer ZX2's.
