                 I have always preferred Ford products. When buying a car
I expect to keep it for awhile. Every Ford I have owned has             given me years of satisfaction. That is until I bought a Taurus.
     One year after buying my car the trouble began. My wife
was driving when she noticed the &quot;Service Engine Soon&quot; light 
came on. She drove the car to the dealer and the Service Manager
said we needed a new transmission. Fortunately our warranty had not expired.
     As far as everything else, I am quite satisfied. It drives
smoothly and the engine seems to have a lot of power. I have
also been satisfied with the gas mileage.
     Before buying a Taurus it would be best to talk to the
Dealer about this. Ask about its history of transmission problems
and what Ford is doing to correct this problem.<br><br>
