            I love my Mustang!!!  It's a great car.  Drives great.. has wonderful pick up and go. Cold cold air conditioner has many accessories and the price of the car is well worth it.The seats are adjustable not only front to back on the driver side, but also up and down which is great for us short people.  There is also a spare cigarette lighter plug for our cell phone. The size is just right not to big not to little. It comes standard with a cd/tape cassette which is the best of both worlds.  The trunk area is spacious and you can lay the back seats down to add extra room for long items. I this this vehicle is great for everyone of any age.  After I bought my car 4 of my friends bought one also!!!<br><br>
