            I love my 1998 Ford Expedition!  It meets all of our needs- it can handle towing around two large boxers, one active toddler, and a load from Costco all without getting too crowded.  It drives like a car, yet you stand tall above the rest.  It is easy to park and manuver around in.  
I could see myself owning this same vehicle for the next ten years and not getting sick of it.  
The expedition has plenty of room (much more so than our previous SUV, a Jeep Cherokee).  The only downside to it's massive size is that we had to buy a shed to make room for all the stuff we had to move out of the garage so we could house this bad boy!  The other downside is that it is a gas hog-- I probably only get about 11 or 12 miles to the gallon.
I would recommend this vehicle to people with kids who need lots of room, and who hate the way minivans look.
We have owned our Expedition for a year now, and so far have not had a single problem with it.  Try it, you will love it!
