            I bought my Car in May of 2000 and have had my problems with it.  But over all it is the best car I could have purchased at that time.

I payed only 2200 dollars for my car, and a week after i bought it the fuel pump went out when i was driving so i took it to Ford Dealer(Biggest Mistake ever)  Had It fixed and some test ran on it, but the depressing thing was that while my car was there someone punch my locks and ford would not pay for damages.

I put on an after market exhaust sytem on it, after that my oil pan gaskets leaked and my third gear synchros went out. I had that fixed and it only cost 1300 buck to have my tranny rebuilt and a new clutch.  So far i have had only those problems with it and have become an expert when it comes to fixing anything on the probe.

IN short this car is the best car in the world and ask anyone who owns one to verify it.<br><br>
