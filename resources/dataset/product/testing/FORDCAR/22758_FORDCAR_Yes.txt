            I bought my Ford Explorer in 1993 when they weren't the &quot;station wagon&quot; of the 90's.  I have a dirt road 1/3 mile long with lots of ruts and bumps.  I haul pot bellied pigs and my dog, straw, heavy food bags and drive on the lawn.  My Explorer has lasted with general maintenance and new tires! This vehicle is great for riding tough!  I change the oil regularly and the air filter maybe once a year.  This vehicle is not made just for good looks.  This vehicle is for someone who wants to run their car, haul, and off road.<br><br>
