            I was in the market for a car because I had just totaled my 1993 Achieva.  I wanted something comparable.  I hadn't been looking far nor long when the '95 Contour caught my eye.  It wasn't even cleaned up yet, as another couple had just traded it in.  It had only 37,000 miles on it at the time (7/97).  I loved the color (champagne), the body style and the interior.  Purchase price was $12,500, a little higher than I wanted to pay, but I figured it was better than paying less for a car that I may hate after a few months.  I hadn't done any research on the car, and was not familiar with the model.  But, to my liking, it had power windows and locks (beats stretching across the car while driving), dual air bags (decreased insurance premiums), anti-lock brakes, cruise control, and the gear shift (automatic) between the seats (providing a sporty feel).  During the test drive, it was sooo quiet.  While stopped at a light, I could not tell the engine was even running.  The stereo sounded great, the A/C blew ice cold, and the heater blew very hot.  It was easy to steer, easy to drive, and seemed almost to float.  The only options I would have preferred that it didn't have were a cd player and a titled steering wheel.  I could live without those.

Now, a little more than two years later, I still like my car.  It doesn't float anymore, and I hear a little rattle somewhere between the dash and the console.  The paint is showing wear.  I have to keep in mind, however, that I have put an additional 50,000 miles on the vehicle since I bought it.  That's a lot of mostly city miles in a little time!  I've had to put a little money into it for repairs, probably less than $700.  Not too shabby in my opinion.  That money covered the replacement of one sensor module (normal and to be expected after so much time/mileage).  The other repair... I honestly can't remember.  It was one of those things that occur every now and then in most makes/models, but it's not a sign of a bad car.  I also had to replace the plug wires.  Somehow, the wires got burned.  $36 for the wires, free labor from a friend.  I could have done it myself with the right tool.  I've tried three times to give the car a tune-up.  Each mechanic (the first being the Ford dealership) informed me that the plugs are platinum and will not need to be changed until 100,000 miles or more.  The tune-up apparently will cost me about $129 - $150 as an electronic analysis is part of it, but if the plugs are replaced with platinum, it should be good to go for another 75,000 - 100,000 miles.

To sum it up, I really like my car.  I do not regret the purchase, even though I suspect I did overpay a little.  For me, it's comfortable to sit in and to drive.  My husband is 6'1&quot;, so he feels a little cramped, but he still prefers my car over his van for long trips.  My two pre-teen girls can still lie side-by-side in the back seat and catch some sleep when needed.  Also, we've not had any problems fitting luggage for four into the trunk.  For a sub-compact/compact vehicle providing efficiency, safety and comfort, I definitely recommend this vehicle.
