            I do not own an Expedition, I drive one for my job.  It is a base model Expedition and it is, due to my job subjected to much off-road use and abuse.  The ride and room in these things is great &amp; I especially like the fact that they sit pretty high up.  The 4x4 is easy to engage and works pretty good.  

However, after about 45k miles the 5.4 liter Triton V8 starts to lose power &amp; by 60k (hard miles) it is quite a dog.  Likewise the body starts falling apart as well.  Many of our vehicles had the front fenders cracking and rubbing against the doors, a problem Ford fixed.  We had a big problem with wheels coming off, but I think that is due to hard nature of the use we put them to.  Although a base 4x4 model, our vehicles have am/fm cass, cruise, some are XLT's and also have power seats and overhead consoles.  All these items continue to work quite well.

Ford portrays these vehicles running around in the wilderness, they can do that some, but overall it's better suited to shopping mall excursions and the occasional snow drift.  <br><br>
