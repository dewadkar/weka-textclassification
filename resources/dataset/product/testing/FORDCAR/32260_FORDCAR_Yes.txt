            On May 23, 2003, I was in a motor vehicle accident driving my 2001 Ford Windstar Limited.  I was rear-ended.  All of my occupants were wearing seatbelts and we were hit at the Police Officers estimate of 50 MPH.  My wife and 4 year old daughter were passengers and were taken to the hospital by ambulance, for possible back and neck injuries.  I drove myself in another vehicle to the hospital for the same reasons.  Our Windstar took a major hit, but with the way it is built we were completely safe from major injuries.  The van estimate in damage was $12,800.00.  So if you are planning to purchase a minivan, I would highly recommend you get the Windstar.  Safety is a big plus on this vehicle.
