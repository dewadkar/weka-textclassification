            I listed the title as &quot;cloaked blessings&quot; for many reasons.  My husband and I purchased the vehicle used. I was terrified that it was a lemon or had been a flood car because we started having all kinds of strange electrical problems.  Of course the problems occured after we move far from the dealership.  The clock would start to reset almost every day.  some days the stereo wouldn't come on. Little strange things like that.  Not to mention that my daughter could roll down the electric window in the back seat after the car had been turned off.  Well, Ford was ahead of the game.  Turns out that our battery was dieing.  The car is smart enough to shut down completely and conserve energy enough to start the engine.  This way, the driver, hopefully, will not get stuck.  We changed the battery and everything was perfect (it really baffled our mechanic until he found this out).  As for the windows, another feature.  For passengers inside a car that was running but is now turned off, until a door opens, the windows remain fully functioning, even with the keys out of the ignition.  With that knowledge, I am again loving this car.  Another strange but nice feature is that the 96 XLT 4WD that we have also has both disc and drum breaks.  It has all around disc breaks plus separate drum breaks for the emergency break.  I have been led to understand that this is very unusual these days.  

These reasons in addition to the many other reasons given in positive reviews, I love my Ford Explorer and feel confident when I buckle in my children.<br><br>
