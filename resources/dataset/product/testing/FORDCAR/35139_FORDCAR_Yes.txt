            I needed a compact car that offered good fuel mileage had four doors, and enough room for two car seats.  I looked at several different makes and models and choose the Escort.  When I compared the ride offered by each car, the Escort stood out as being exceptionally quiet.  It does not have the normal tin like or hollow sound of a small car.  This won me over.  I chose a basic package with the exception of an automatic transmission (my wife never learned to drive stick).  I was satisfied with the bottom line price $12,000, which included the extended warranty.  

The car has great pickup and shifts very smoothly.  I am very happy with the responsiveness of the braking system.  I travel a lot of congested highway miles and I have the utmost confidence in tight situations.  I average in the mid 30's per gallon of gas.

I would only recommend this car to a small family.  We have two toddlers so the back seat offers ample space.  I like that the back seat folds down and offers space into the trunk.  This works great when we take the kids to the drive in theater.  If you have bigger of a family you should steer away from this car.

I can't say that there is much about the car that I hate.  If anything has soured my experience it has been dealing with the maintenance department where I bought the car.  You would think in this day and age of computer systems your warranty would be on file somewhere.  The first time I took my car in for an oil change, a covered feature for the first 25,000 miles with my warranty, the dealership charged my wife for the service.  The claimed they had no record of us purchasing the warranty.  Rather than argue she paid the $25 bucks and came home.  Then I did the arguing.  I went straight to FORD and complained.  Within minutes I had an apology from the dealership and a refund offer.  It pays to speak up for what is right.<br><br>
