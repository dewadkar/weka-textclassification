            New for this year, the Ford Focus ZX3 is the premier vehicle of 2000. What got me hooked to this vehicle were the streaming good looks and cheap price. As I continually got interested in this vehicle, I found out that it is drives better than other cars in its class.

The standard engine in this 5 speed manual transmission is a 2.0L V4. It has 130 horsepower at 5300 revolutions per minute. With rising fuel prices, this car is just what you need to save the gas money. The gas mileage is 26 in the city and 33 on the highway. Tank capacity is 13.2 gallons.

The one thing that I see as a downer for this vehicle is the small size. However, if it was bigger, I think that it would lose its flashy charm. Here are some interior dimensions:

                       Head Room (Fr/Rr)       39.3/38.7
                       Leg Room (Fr/Rr)        43.1/37.6
                       Shoulder Room (Fr/Rr)   53.7/53.5
                       Hip Room (Fr/Rr)        49.4/49.5

At a height of only 56.3 inches, getting into the vehicle may be difficult for taller drivers. Surprisingly, this small vehicle can tow 1000 pounds.

The ZX3 has disc/drum brakes, rack and pinnon steering, and independent suspension in the front and back. Some other vehicles in the compact class have independent suspension in the front, but semi in the back.

Priced at only $12,055 as its base price, you may not expect many standard options, but that is not the case.  Standard features include driver and passenger side airbag, alloy wheels, anti-theft system, rear defogger, fog lamps, power steering, AM/FM radio with CD player, second row folding seats and a tachometer. If you are planning to buy the ZX3 I would suggest the optional air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, power locks, and automatic transmission.

Basically if you want a car that is fun to drive and gets the attention of people everywhere, then the ZX3 is for you. Yet, if the smallness of the car is backing you away, then maybe the Focus SE or LX sedan or SE wagon is for you.
