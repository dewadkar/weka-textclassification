            We bought the Windstar after a year of a small car with a baby.  And after checking out different makes and models, we always came back to the Windstar with better facts.  I love the fact it has the Automatic Sliding doors, and very comfortable to ride in.  I cant really say much about hating this vehicle, its a wonderful make and model.  The only thing they needed on the Windstar was a handle on the outside of the rear, so you can shut the lid easy.  It has been troubles with a baby in hands and groceries in the other to shut properly.
I make alot of road trips and its like riding on air....you never notice a bump in the road, and your child never wakes!  I love my leather seats to death, never thought i would, but with a child its easy to wipe up that spilt juice or that mud they had on there shoes.
I think everyone should own a van.....With or without kids.  My parents have talked about getting a minivan the windstar at that since i have gotten mine.  Anyone that ever has more that 4 people or with kids or going out to dinner. instead of taking 2 cars cause you have the carseat and there just isnt enough room in the back for that and 2 adults!

A wonderful Make behalf of Ford!  Will always buy there products, and will never get rid of my van!  If i have too i will get another one!
