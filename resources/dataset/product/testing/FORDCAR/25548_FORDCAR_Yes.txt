            I didn't know this vehicle even existed until I started looking at cars at the dealers. The more I looked at it the more I liked it. It's design was unique, modern and, rugged looking. I have had Ford products in the past and I was always happy with them. After looking at it in and out, going over the features and the specs, it appeared to meet with what I was looking for perfectly. All that was left was to take it for a test ride to see if it was something I could live with over the next few years, and be satisfied with. 
Well, after just a few feet down the road, I was already impressed. I truly believe this car feels like a much more expensive car than it is. It feels solid, stable, smooth. The seats are extremely comfortable. The power is adequate, it was also pretty quiet. Not truck like at all. I went ahead with the purchase, and have since taken it off road, and again this car was a joy to drive, and gripped well in loose gravel, mud and ice. I have to say that my wife and I also own a Land Rover Discovery that we are very fond of, but we both are fighting for the keys to the Sport Trac. It is very comfortable, drives nice, it's actually fun, and very practical. The 6 cd in dash player and moon roof are two great options as well. We have the tan leather interior, with white exterior, and have had many compliments so far. For the money, I think it is a great buy, and beats the competiton as far as power, towing, interior room.
I love it!<br><br>
