            I've had my 1992 Ford Explorer for awhile now and it is still in great shape with no major problems so far.

I can feel it's age, but it does run nicely for an almost 8 year old vehicle.  The biggest problem is city driving.  The stop and go of city driving clogs up the fuel system and causes the Ford Explorer to run roughly.  An easy although time consuming solution is to simply take it on a road trip.  After driving for about 2 hours at 70 mph (Texas speed limit is 70 mph) using super unleaded, and the Ford Explorer purrs like a kitten again.  It runs real smooth after that.  A month or so of city driving starts to clog the fuel system back up though.

One thing I don't like about the Ford Explorer is that it only goes up to about 85 mph.  Although, I must honestly admit that that is probably a good thing and has probably saved me a lot of money on speeding tickets.  At least in Texas, they raised the speed limit to 70 mph.  Now, ironically, we can all drive the same speed we used to drive at, but now it's legal.  :)

The biggest pain in the neck I have had with it is the air conditioning.  It has gone out on me several times which is a big headache and very expensive to fix.  In Texas, air conditioning is almost a necessity and the mechanics know that, so repair costs are extremely high.

The interior has stood up well over 8 years.  And the exterior has held up well as long as I kept it well waxed.  People often thought it was new after I fully detailed the vehicle.  

Overall, if you take care of this vehicle, it will last a very long time.  The quality is remarkably good for a Ford.  I am saying that since Ford tends to have a reputation (rightly or wrongly) that they make great looking vehicles, but Chevrolet makes great running vehicles.  I've been happy with this Ford Explorer and still drive it today without problems.
