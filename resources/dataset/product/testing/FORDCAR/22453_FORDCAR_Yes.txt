            I also have a Jeep Cherokee Epinion.  I buy all of my vehicles based on capability and performance,  not on bells and whistles.  I bought a 1999 Ford Ranger XLT 4x4,  5 speed manual, 4.0 liter engine, 4.10 rear end, 4 door extended cab,  regular bed,  16&quot; wheels, with a topper.  This is my second Ford (the first was a 1992 Probe that has 180,000 miles with NO problems, and that my Mother owns and drives today).   I find the vehicle to be extremely smooth and strong in the mountains (I live in the Rockies at 9000ft and work at 5500ft;  a commute I make every day on winding mountain roads).  It has plentiful torque and power,  loaded or unloaded,  and is very capable and safe in the snow (which we get from Oct. through April--sometimes in copius amounts).  As a matter of fact,  when I left the house today there were about 20 fresh inches of snow on the driveway and in our development which the Ranger handled famously.  I replaced the tires and brake pads at 25,000 miles(2 items I go through MORE than the average.) I had a tick in the engine(from the time of purchase) that Ford acknowledged.  They replaced the engine at no cost and agreed to extend the warranty. The Ranger rides like a dream on top of the 16&quot; rims,  both on the pavement and off.  The 4.0 liter is very strong,  as I can run the high mountain passes at about 80mph with plenty of pedal left.  The long wheel base inhibits some of its off-road capability (high-centering), but the smallish stock tires weren't helping that either.  At about $21,500 with the topper,  it has been all I could have hoped for and then some to this point.  It's MUCH stronger in the hills than ANY of the comparable Jap trucks I drove (including those in the $25-28,000 range),  and has more interior room and a larger overall feel.  It feels like a BIG truck,  without the BIG gas bill.<br><br>
