            I was looking to buy a car about one year ago and I spent several months researching a vehicle both online and in the showrooms.  I finally settled on the 1998 Ford Mustang GT and have been a pretty satisfied customer.  The other cars that I was considering at the time were the Honda Prelude, Toyota Celica, Mitsubishi Eclipse GT, and Acura Integra.  I really didn't think that I would buy an American car, but I was very impressed with the Mustang for three reasons:  Power, Size, and Price.

I was really impressed with the horsepower of the Mustang relative to the other cars in its class(now the 1999 version has even more horsepower-260)the other cars that I test drove didn't have the same powerful feel of the Mustang.  

When it came to size all of the cars were small(obviously) but the Mustang had the most room both in the front and the back.  I've been able to carry four adults in the car for some short trips.  It was still very uncomfortable, but in the other cars it would have been impossible.  

Price is of course the limiting factor in buying a car and the Mustang was the most car for the least money.  To get a similarly priced Eclipse it was in the range of 24000-25000.

If you are going to buy the Mustang I would recommend a few basic options that are a must.  The 17 inch wheels and upgraded tires are worth the $500 price tag.  The low profile tires are expensive to replace but they enhance the cornering ability and the feel of the road under your car.  Another option that is a must is the Mach460 sound system.  It is a huge improvement over the stock radio.  It is surprisingly good for being a Ford radio, but obviously not the same quality of the Bose systems found in some other cars.  The last option that I thought was a must was the leather interior (Black leather for my metallic black mustang).  

Though I really like my Mustang there are a few problems with it.  It is a fairly noisy car.  I hear a lot of wind and road noise when I'm driving on the highway and this can be annoying at times.  Also there are some creaks and rattles that are starting to develop after several months.  Also, the stick shift would occasionally get locked out of reverse requiring me to re-clutch.  I took this to a dealer and they were unable to find the problem.

Overall the Mustang is a great car for a reasonable price.  It is fast, relatively roomy, and cool car to cruise around in.<br><br>
