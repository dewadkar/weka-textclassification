            This is a really nice truck.  Just like my Probe GT, I ordered it and got exactly what I wanted.  I used my A-plan for the purchase so I got it a little cheaper than invoice.  Bought it in September 1999.

F150 Lariat 4x4 Supercab short bed
5.4L V8
Wedgewood Blue w/ Silver
Gray leather interior (standard w/ Lariat)
Towing pacakage
Black side steps
All power (standard w/ Lariat)
Ok...basically, everything is standard w/ the Lariat... :)
I added a bedliner later

It's a great truck, I can't complain too much.  The color blue is darker than I expected based on previous years, but I am still happy w/ it and I really like the silver accent at the bottom.  I really like the truck, tho it took some getting used to in order to drive b/c I was used to a Ford Probe GT...much smaller and handles much differently.

I bought the truck b/c I was always needing to borrow a truck for something.  I have another house which I am renovating and I was always needing a truck to haul tree limbs, trash, drywall, moulding, wood, etc.  It was just something that was necessary for me to get things done.  I also decided that since my car had over 100,000 miles on it, it might be a good idea to have a backup...and a new 'nice' vehicle.  Don't get me wrong, my car is still great...and I do use this truck as a truck.  It is not just for cruising around town and does go offroad into my brother's farm quite often.

Now to the real review...

Mileage

Ehh...it's a truck, remember that.  I get about 14 in the city and maybe 16 or so on the highway.  Typical of a V8.  It is generally better than the Dodge trucks which seem to be real gas guzzlers.  There are things you can do aftermarket to increase your gas mileage.

Comfort

Very comfortable.  It is a good vehicle for a long trip, tho the gas could get expensive.  The super cab is nice for hauling more people.  The 4 doors are great for letting people in and out and throwing in luggage or tools...whatever you need.  The 4 doors are a great thing.  The back is comfortable for adults, tho the seats aren't probably what you want for a long trip.  The front seats are fine for adults on a long trip tho.  I opted to not get the captain's chairs.  I stayed w/ the bench seat b/c the extra $400 for captain's chairs would be a waste.  The basic difference is that you get a large center console and lose the ability to have three people sit up front.  The seats and amount of leather are basically the same.  I don't recommend the captain's chairs unless you just want them for the looks or really, really need the different center console.

Parking

It's a big truck...I can never park it right the first time.  I almost always have to readjust before it is just right.  I can park it just fine in a big field tho... :)

Problems

No problems to date.  I have 11,000 miles on it so far.

Performance

Very good.  It has plenty of power for whatever you need.  I haven't towed w/ it yet, but I have no doubt that it can pull anything I want w/in reason.  It accelerates well for mergin into traffic, passing, etc.  Remember it's not a sports car and will not move along like my Probe GT does.  That took some getting used to.  It has 4 wheel antilock brakes standard.  That is nice and gets an insurance discount.

Cockpit

The interior is laid out very well. You can see all the gauges and get to everything very easily. The center console could use some improvement.  It is not really all that deep for a lot of things.  It also has dividers for tapes...but my truck came w/ a CD player.  That means that you don't really have a way to store CDs very well.  That's ok, b/c I lug my CDs around in a case of their own anyway.  I really really wish the truck had the 'fade to black' interior light like my Probe does.  It fades gradually until it off instead of just going off when the door is closed.  I also think the ignition key slot should be lighted like my Probe.  It is hard to find w/o turning on the interior light.  I wish you could turn on the fog lights w/o turning on the parking lights.

Stereo

The stereo is typical.  I think the dual media one should be an option for the Lariat if not standard.  That means you could play CDs or tapes.  There should be no reason why it can't be offered since both type stereos will fit in the same dash.  The sound is very nice w/ a lot of bass.  I like the way the controls will light based on what you are listening too.  When you listen to the radio, the buttons are lit w/ the radio options.  When you put in a CD, the lighting changes to reflect the CD options.  I just realized I have never had the CD player skip...even when I was driving around in my brother's field...which is not smooth at all...kind of like driving over continuous speed bumps... :)  I wish I had the options my brother had on his Explorer...dual media in dash player w/ a CD changer also.  The problem w/ the F150 is the changer will be factory installed into your center console.  I'd prefer it be under the seat and not take up the premium space in my console.

Exterior

I got Wedgewood Blue as my paint w/ a silver accent at the bottom. It is beautiful.  Is it obvious that my favorite color is blue?  My Probe is blue too.  The paint seems durable so far.

Tires...

I still have the factory tires...Goodyear...not Firestone... :)  I like them well enough so far.  The chrome steel wheels look very nice w/ any tires tho...except whitewalls...

Durability...

It's very durable for the time I have had it.  I can't complain.  It is a truck after all...it needs to be durable.  Despite the fact that I got the 'luxury' truck model, I do use it as a truck all the time.  I added a bedline b/c it was just the sensible thing to do.  I haul everything and anything w/ this truck.  I look forward to some snow so I can use my tow strap and pull some people out of the ditch this winter...just another reason to lock it into 4 wheel drive.

Space...

The interior space is good.  You can easily haul 4 adults.  The front is spacious and the back is moderately comfortable.

Recommendations...

I got keyless entry w/ this vehicle as well and highly recommend it.  The keypad on the door is great for getting in w/o your keys.  I would like to revise the interior a bit.  I'd like the fade to black interior lighting, a light for the ignition so you can find it in the dark, and lighted mirrors.  A better sound system option would be nice too.  I mean, this is the luxury truck and it should have all the options that you can get on the Explorer.  I want to add a bedcover also...the one that retracts like a garage door and rolls up in a box behind the cab.  Heck, a power sliding rear window would be nice while I'm at it.

Overall...

I have heard of problems w/ much earlier years of the F150.  This one seems to have a lot of bugs worked out.  I wish the cab was as big and luzurious as the comparable Chevrolet, but what I got is fine.  I like the truck and plan to keep it for as long as I need a truck.  If I get to the point where I don't need one, I will probably replace it w/ an Explorer.

Oh yeah...for some reason every friend I have that is a girl wants to drive this truck and just love it...which is the reason for the title...I still haven't figured that one out tho.
