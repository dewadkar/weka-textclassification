            Overall, I love this truck.  My wife wanted one.  I wanted to spend less money.  But she eventually got her way and we purchased an Estate Green 2003 Ford Explorer Sport Trac.

I love that we can fit 5 people comfortably in the car-like cabin.  I love the looks (although a little "girly.")  I love having a pickup truck in the household for those gardening purchases at Lowes.

We got the Pioneer premium sound system, which is a little pricey, but sounds really good for an OEM system.  Much better than the CRAP BOSE system in my Corvette.

We did not get the bed cover from the dealer, but ordered it aftermarket.  I'd suggest the factory cover.  We also got the bed extender, which is inexpensive and well worth the money.

Our Sport Trac is the XLT Premium and has all the goodies except leather, which the wife didn't want.  (Saved me $!)

Acceleration is acceptable and ride is ok - a bit "floaty" and harsh, but not too bad.

The vehicle is really good in nearly every respect except one:  It hydroplanes far too easily.  Coming down the mountains on 25 between Hendersonville and Greenville we hydroplaned badly and from the left lane, I ended up barely saving the vehicle after sliding across two lanes into the emergency lane where I was able to regain traction and straighten it out before leaving the roadway.

Basically, we have just had to slow way down in the rain, much slower than in most cars.  I realize we are running 265 tires (wide) and that hydroplaning comes easier with wider tires, but they have deep tread and it is a heavy vehicle (4,000+) and would I expect it to be better in the rain than it is.
