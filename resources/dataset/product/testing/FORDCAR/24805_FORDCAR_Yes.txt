            Thirty-six years ago Ford introduced a sporty little coupe called the Mustang.  It was well-powered, had decent handling (for the time) and looked great.  In 1969 the BOSS 302 cemented itself as a performance legend, and received rave reviews for its handling prowess.  In 1971-1973 the Mustang got bloated and underpowered (1972-73), but had perhaps the best factory suspension offered in a Mustang up until 1994.  Now the  cycle has been completed.  After two decades of sloshing through the puny underpowered cars of the '70s and the well powered crates-on-wheels of the '80s and early '90s, the Mustang has finally progressed to another level, achieving that pinnacle of performance not seen since 1970 (the last BOSS 302).

The Mustang finally got through its awkward years ('94-'98) with little fanfare (nice little cars, but they lack the last edge of refinement and power needed to complete the package) and now has moved on in 1999-2000 to become what it has been striving toward for the 30 years since the last BOSS.

When I finally got to drive a new Mustang, I was delighted, gone is that annoying thud of the too-tight rear suspension, and gone is that propensity to run out of guts right as the SOHC valvetrain starts to pay off in reduced frictional losses.  The new GT is awesome.  I love this car, flat out.  The engine is a dream that combines a fittingly robust exhaust note with the proper amount of thrust for enthusiastic daily transportation.  The car corners marginally better that the last generation, but that was not a short-coming in the old car buy any stretch.  The most endearing change made to this version is the solidity of the body structure, the '94 eclipsed the '93 and the '99 did the same to the '98(same as '94).  I only have two complaints about the new Mustang.  One, the shifter is weak and imprecise, it is the same unit that has been used for ages in the Mustang and any aftermarket piece is a vast improvement, and two, the interior is still a little too cramped in the footwells.

I have yet to sample the new, more powerful V6, but have heard only good things about it.  I also would recommend that any owners order a set of Eibach lowering springs, they drop the car one inch and make it look right, you don't even notice it because it puts the car where you think it &quot;should&quot; be in the first place.

Before I finish up, I should also say that the GT coupe is probably the best alternative for most buyers, it is cheaper, faster, and quieter.  It also is guaranteed to have fewer things break over its life, because it has fewer things to break, and personally, I'd take the coupe for myself in a heartbeat.

In summary, Ford finally got it right, and I LOVE the fact that you can still get one with a solid rear axle (they may not be the most comfortable way to set up a suspension, but man, are they FUN!!!).  This is the Mustang that can be driven every day of the year, and never wears on you (or your back).<br><br>
