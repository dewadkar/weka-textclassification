            I have been an Suburban owner for about 4 years now.  It has been a great investment.  Held resale value superior to mini-vans. 
Great in the Winter snow and our long lane to our house.  Wife and kids always make it home.  Not used in Suburban area, or for soccer.
16-18 MPH with 350 V8 in 1500 sub..  First set of tires are still on at 56,000 miles, should get 62,000-65,000 on first set.  Some vans get 15,000-25,000 per set.
I am consider the Excursion, and just got done with a overnight test drive of one.
Yes, it is bigger than a Sub, but it still fits in my garage just as well.
Milege is below my 1/2 ton Sub, but on par with the 3/4 ton sub with the 7.4L.
Performance is good.  V10 has plenty of get up and go.
We pull a 6 place snowmobile trailer, and a 10,000 pound boat with our Sub, the Excursion will handle this with ease.
Access to the rear-most seat is much better on the Excursion than the Sub.
Rear doors are also an improvement over our 96 Sub, and over the 2000 Subs.
Bucket seats are a little too narrow, makes a little wind noise around doors, little more busy to drive than a Sub.
