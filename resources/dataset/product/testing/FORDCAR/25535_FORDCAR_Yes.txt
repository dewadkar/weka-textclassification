            So often, I am disappointed when &quot;concept&quot; cars move from the pages of automotive magazines to the showroom.  Frequently stripped of detail and &quot;mainstreamed&quot; for lower prices and wider acceptance, concept cars tend to go from exciting to mundane very quickly. Not so with the new Ford Explorer Sport-Trac, Ford's answer to the four-door truck craze.  

<b>Looks</b>
The Sport-Trac is a head turner.  It doesn't look like a stretched truck, it doesn't look like a lopped-off Explorer.  It's lines and proportions make this hybrid vehicle unique in its class.  The front fascia, shared with the 2001 Explorer Sport, further distinguishes the truck from it's suburban brother, the ever-popular Explorer.  Inside, the truck lives up to the <i>Sport</i> portion of its name with white-faced gauges, and nickle colored accents on the door and dash.  

<b>Space</b>
Inside, the Sport Trac is nearly identical space wise to the Explorer. Front seat passengers find plenty of leg, head, and shoulder room. The backseat <i>seemed</i> a bit smaller to me than the traditional Explorer.  This is probably a psychological thing, though, since the rear window is right behind the seat.  The short bed of the Sport Trac is not practical for heavy haulers--you won't see any four by eight sheets of material back there.  But for the weekend gardener, outdoor enthusiast, or person seeking an alternative to the SUV cliche--the Sport Trac will be more than adequate.  With the optional tonneau cover, the bed will serve as a spacious trunk for family vacations.

<b>Amenities</b>
The Sport-Trac I tried (proudly owned by a good friend of mine) was well equipped with all power features, overhead console, CD player, cruise, air conditioning, keyless and remote entry, and a host of other amenities.  One interesting feature was a power rear window that allowed access into the bed. Under the front seat armrest, instead of a traditional console, is a soft-side bag that clips into place and can be removed.  This was an interesting feature that, it would seem, prove quite useful.  Another thing I liked was the rubber flooring in the truck--which added to the rugged appeal and seemed like a practical alternative to carpeting.

<b>Handling and Performance</b>
The standard 4.0 liter V-6 provided ample power for day to day driving, though I imagine it would be a tad weak for towing purposes.  Unlike the full-sized Explorer, the Sport Trac seemed to hug the road, with negligible body roll and none of the &quot;rear end sway&quot; I have experienced with other rear-wheel drive sports-utes.  The automatic transmission, which I was disappointed to see controlled by a steering-column mounted shifter, was smooth and responsive.

If you are in the market for a four-door truck, I would suggest the Sport-Trac. If the performance of my father's Explorer is any indication, the Sport Trac should provide years of reliability. Its futuristic looks will garner stares at the stop light, and its versatile design will allow it to step up to any chore you put before it.<br><br>
