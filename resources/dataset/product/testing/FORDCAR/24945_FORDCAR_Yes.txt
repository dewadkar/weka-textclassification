            I've driven ford mustangs since my 16th birthday. I was given my first for my birhtday. It was the 1988 mustangLX.  Being young and reckless I can guarantee to you that these cars can take a beating a live to tell about it, over and over and over again.  That particular car is still running wonderfully after twelve years really tough years. Now that I'm a mom and tamed I can still rely on mustangs to be safe and reliable; and look very cool. Although i prefer the look of the older models(especially the 1964) the newer versions are still one of the best looking cars on the road.<br><br>
