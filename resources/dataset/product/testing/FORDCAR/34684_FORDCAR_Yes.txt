            I love my Thunderbird.  This is the first "new" car I purchased (it was a program car). I was so excited in September 1995 when I drove this car off the lot.  I had test drove several cars.  I had dreamed of a Mustang but about cried after I finally drove one (another story).  The T-bird is just the right combo of sport and sedan.  My car is a unique color (or at least when I got it) - Chameleon Blue.  It looks purple but changes color in the light. I accidentally hit a pole at the bank with it and was pleasantly surprised that the body shop matched the color very well.  I can't tell the difference.  

The power of this car is incredible.  The 4.6 liter V-8 is a nice powerful engine.  The car handles like a dream except at take-offs on wet pavement.  You can not accelerate quickly if you are coming from a complete stop on wet pavement or the rear-end will try to come around on you.  For that reason I do not recommend this car for the novice driver who has a lead foot.  As an experienced driver I know that this is the case and I accelerate gently in wet conditions.

I like the color coding under the hood.  It is nice to be able to check my fluids myself and know exactly what I am checking.  The only complaint with the engine design and layout is the placement of the oil filter - hard to get to from the top or bottom - my solution - take it to an express oil change place - it is worth it to let them mess with it.

The front seat is comfortable.  The back is a little tight for an adult when the person in the front of you puts their seat back.  Unfortunately the proliferation of SUV's and pick-ups has made driving difficult for us car lovers.  They park on either side of you in parking lots and it is difficult to see to get out, they block your view on the road and at exits of parking lots.  I don't consider this a problem for the T-bird itself but one for all who prefer to drive cars over those massive vehicles.

This is the second T-bird I owned (the first being an 84).  I was deeply upset when ford cancelled production of them as they were being made.  I don't know what I will do the day that I have to go to a car lot and pick out another car.  They just do not make them like the T-bird.

UPDATE - March 2002 - I am still driving my precious T-Bird.  I have not had to have any major repairs on it.  Outside of routine maintenance I have spent $450 on repairs, a rear brake booster and the oil sending unit.  So, yes it is still simply the best to me.  I have 116,900 miles on the car and look forward to putting at least another 50,000 on it.
