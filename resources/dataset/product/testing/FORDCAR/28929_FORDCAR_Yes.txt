            I just bought the new 2000 Ford explorer Sport and I love it. It drives like a dream. It has excelent hydrolics and shocks. I have never had a car that drove this well. And i've had plenty let me tell you. The steering is excelent and always in line. This car has so much room that I was tempted to sleep in it. The air conditioning blows so silently that you forget that it is on. This car has so many places to put things so you don't have to worry about losing thing under you seat. I also really like the panic button. I don't know why but i have so much fun with it. The alloy wheels also look really nice. The Sound system is Incredible. I have never heard factory speakers with such power. There are also really high ceilings so if you are tall you are not singled out. And there is a great trunk. It is really big and the back seats fold forward and under to give you even more room. Party in the Explorer. I definatly recommend this vehicle. The only thing I would get that was not in the package are the automatic seats. Other than that it's great<br><br>
