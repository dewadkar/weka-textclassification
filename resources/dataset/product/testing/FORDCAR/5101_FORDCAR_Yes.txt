            We purchased our 97 SHO Jan. 01 with 34K and in perfect shape.  We decided not to opt for the additional warranty at $1300.  Bad Choice, at 40K, just out of warranty, the tranny went out.  After several phone calls to Ford (we buy company and personal vehicles only through them and have a huge list of loyalty cars, 6 new and 3 used, and father used to own ford dealership) they offered no help for the $2600 cost of replacing it.  Since then the check engine light has been on, although nothing seems to be wrong, so we have decided not to pay them to dig around to find out what is causing it, since their doesn't seem to be a problem.  Just after that the tires went bad and cost us about $600 to replace them with Z-rated, which is really your only choice.  The alarm seems to go off in the middle of the night for no apparent reason.  And also the dome light goes on and off as it pleases, which we just found out from the Ford garage that it MIGHT be (they are not sure, we just have to take the $140 gamble) an oxygen sensor.  We also lost both keys and had to pay to have it towed ($95) 1/2 mile to the Ford garage so they can make a new one.  The car is at 60K right now and the speakers have all crapped out, but you can't change them without spending some $$$ or you can buy factory speakers but that is still $$$.  The CD player has almost entirely quit reading CD's but to replace the Console it is a mess so just live with it.  The interior floormats also got stained and we are looking at $250!! for new SHO floormats.  

But the good stuff...It is really a high performance car if you know how to drive it right.  Switching from an escort to this would probably be too much.  This is also not the type of car you want to buy for your 16 year old, they will hurt themselves.  The interior is roomy and comfortable, and the trunk is huge (2 sets of golf clubs fit perfectly).  Long trips on good roads are comfy, but in town bumpy roads are a little rough and bounce you around a bit.  MPG is average, about 18 on mine.  For the price it comes with alot of good features like leather, sunroof, power everything, V8 235hp engine, etc.
