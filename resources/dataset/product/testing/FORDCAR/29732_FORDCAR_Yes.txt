            A few nights ago, my friends needed a favor. They asked me to drive them to the L.A.X. airport on a Friday night. Do you know what the airport is like in the summer, on a holiday weekend? HELL! Of course that didn't stop me from volunteering my services. It got even better. They fed me pizza, gave me beer, and let me borrow their SUV for nine days. 

Can I tell you how stoked I am? Let me fill you in on the type of cars I've had to drive in the last ten years. My first car was this piece of Sh*t (to be sung to the Adam Sandler tune), which was on its last leg literally. The bumper was tied to the frame with some thick rope, the sunroof was opened whether you wanted it to be or not. 

From ol' Betsy, I moved on to Sarah, a Chevrolet Sprint. It was the size of a Tanka Toy. It was great for parking in compact places but had its share of accidents, no not by me! Needless to say, Sarah was put to rest and Naomi took her place, &quot;Miss Hawaii&quot; as I called her. She was a dark beauty with a few rust spots. What can I say, she lived by the beach and the salt water hovered upon her &quot;Jetta&quot; body. She was around for awhile, but then the headaches started to set in. Actually it was my wallet that started to feel the pain. She was becoming high maintenance, so I had to sell her.

Now, I have Ruby. A Mercury Topaz, which drives well, but isn't the most glamorous of gals. She got into a fight with some other chick and was left with a big scar on her right side. Poor thing! Once again I wasn't driving. Anyway, Ruby is sitting in my friends garage taking a little vacation, while her momma is babysitting something much bigger, and much much better! 

I'm in love with Eddie!! Mr. Bauer to you. He and I have bonded in the last few days. This wasn't the first time I've had the privilege of sitting in Ed's lap. This was however the most time I've ever spent cruising with him. He makes driving in L.A. a wonderful relaxing,  experience. I've taken him everywhere. He's been gettin' a little crazy wearing his smooth leather outfit. The way he's built I can tell he's been working out again. I'm purrrrring...with excitement!

I've been enjoying the way he handles the road, the power underneath his hood, and his all around smoothness. I love the way he sits up high and intimidates those other little guys. As for the way he passes gas, well he could do a little better mileage wise. 

Eddie makes me feel pretty darn special when I'm driving him. He also has plenty of room for any necessities that might need to be dragged along. We were able to fit three huge luggages, stroller, duffle bags, a child's car seat and a few other bulky items. There was still so much room left. 

All in all, I can't complain. Until, my friends come back in another week of course. Then I will probably sit and cry about the man I fell in love with...Mr. Eddie Bauer. Meanwhile, I'll just keep enjoying our time together. I'll let you know how he handles me going on a date. Didn't I tell you? I was out crusing with Eddie the other day, and I met a cutie pie on the road. He gave me his digits and now we're supposed to go hang out. See, Eddie has the midas touch. He sure is a looker! Both chicks and dudes dig him. I didn't know he was such a swinger...I'm sure going to miss him!
