            My husband and I purchased our '95 Ford Aspire to replace his '87 Pontiac 6000. I drive a Ford Festiva, the predecessor to the Aspire, and I'm very pleased with it. My husband is 6' tall, and likes having a big car, so I had to talk him into test-driving the sub-compact Aspire.

Suprisingly, he liked it immediately. This car has ample head room and leg room, even for a tall driver. Kia Motors (who produced the Aspire for Ford) used a cab forward design to maximize the interior space. The backseat is small, with most of the leg room devoted to the front driver and passenger seats. We have the 3-door hatchback version of the Aspire, and it has a folding rear seat that provides ample cargo space.

The Aspire has comfortable seats and a bright white instrument panel that's easy to read. The heating, rear defrost and air conditioning work wonderfully. The Aspire has a softer suspension than the Festiva, which minimizes the discomfort of a rough road. The drawback to the softer suspension is that the Aspire does not corner well at high speeds. 

The Aspire has a 1.3L 73 HP engine. Although I've heard many complaints about its performance, the acceleration is adequate, even with the automatic transmission. The car accelerates quietly and the automatic shifts smoothly. 

The dual airbags and crumple zone design give me a feeling of safety in the Aspire. I've heard other people describe the Aspire as dangerous because of it's light weight, but the Aspire's light weight actually enables it to brake much quicker than our Pontiac 6000 or any of the other bigger vehicles my husband has owned. Last week, a truck in front of me rear-ended another vehicle, setting off a chain reaction of rear-ends. I was able to stop just in time, but five other cars weren't that lucky.

I really enjoy driving this car, and so does my husband. We only paid $2900 for a '95 with 74k, so this car was extremely affordable. This price included a security system and $1200 stereo/CD player with a subwoofer that the previous owner installed only 8 months ago. The gas mileage is incredible at around 30 miles per gallon.

I would recommend this car to anyone who needs reliable, affordable transportation. The Aspire is a great second car for a family that's already making big payments on a mini-van or SUV. It's also a great car for a couple like us who don't have kids and need enough room to throw our camping gear in the back.
