            I purchased a 1998 V6 Mustang in February of 2000 from McDaniel Ford in Hicksville, NY.  It is my first car that I have ever owned.  The car came with 16.5K miles on it and cost me $13.7K  I felt I should have gotten a GT, but the insurance was not worth it.  I could have chosen a few other cars, but the Ford Mustang really catches my eye.  Even though I see plenty of them out there, it is still a head-turning car.  Anyway, I had narrowed my choices down to two different Stangs.  They were both 1998's but one was silver and the other black.  I chose the black one with the black interior because it is a lot more sporty looking and more of a guy's car.

The seats are very comfortable in the front and the driver's seat has a power button that can make the seat go front, back, up and down.  The passanger seat has a lever and only goes front and back.  I was surprised to learn that the view of the road from a Mustang is great.  The way the front is designed lets you see the whole road ahead of you.  Nothing that is on the car (dash board, hood, steering wheel) really gets into your view of the road.  However comfortable the front seats might be, there shouldn't even be back seats.  My friends have a hard time sitting back there without bumping their head on the back windshield when we hit a bump, and it has almost absolutely no leg room.  I can only really fit 1 person in the back comfortably.  If anyone sits behind me, I have to move my seat up, and that usually means my knees are in the steering column.

The steering of the car is pretty heavy.  I have driven my mothers new Acura 3.2 and I can't keep control of the damn thing.  The steering on my Mustang is not sensitive at all compared to most cars nowadays.  The ride itself isn't really bumpy, but you do feel those speed bumps and potholes twice as worse than any other car I've driven.

I was disappointed in the stock engine performance of the V6 Mustang at first.  The car came stock with 150HP and a dinky single exhaust pipe that bends down (and looks very ugly.)  It had no GT exhaust, so it also sounded like garbage as well.  But I learned that there is always room for improvement.  I put in a K&amp;N Air Filter and put on a '99 GT dual exhaust, for performance, and as well as looks.  There are so many things you can do to a Mustang to increase performance and enhance looks.

Overall the car is really fun to drive.  You do turn a lot of heads, and a lot of Honda Civics try to race you (hehe, silly imports.)  I would recommend this car to teenagers and adults alike.  I love my Mustang.
