            I first saw the ZX2 while at the Ford dealership looking for a Mustang.  This sporty little car definitely caught my eye.  I had never see the car before and I couldn't believe my ears when the salesman told me that it was an escort.  I know, you probably see them more now, but they are still a hot little car.

The first thing I noticed was the styling.  The headlights look rather strange at first, but they grow on you.  The styling is overall pretty nice, but the back end needs some work.  The reflector on the back goes all the way across.  However, any aftermarket tailight cover can fix that.  

Then I went for a test drive.  I was used to an old Mercury Tracer, so this thing definitely flew!  We took it onto the highway, and I was definitely impressed with the quickness of this little 4 cylinder.  This is probably due to the sporty 2.0L Zetec with 130hp, which doesn't seem like much, unless the car only weights around 2500lbs. The light weight design also makes the car very easy to drive.

The next thing I noticed (which is probably what really sold me)was the price.  I was able to get an automatic with all the packages (a/c, power everything, cruise control, etc.) fog lights, and a sunroof for $13,500.  

This car is very sporty, but can also make a very nice econocar if you don't need sporty.  If it is more speed you are after to compete with Civic's and Integra's, then a ZX2 with a manual transmission is perfect.  If you just want a inexpensive car with great gas mileage, the reliability of an escort, with a little quickness around town, then it is also perfect for you.

If you are interested in an inexpensive sports car that you can work on, the ZX2 is just that.  The aftermarket for the ZX2 is growing every day, and there is even a car club for the ZX2 (www.zx2.com).  This is a good car to consider if you are looking into the Civic, Cavalier, Sunfire, etc.<br><br>
