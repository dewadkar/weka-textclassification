            1999 Ford Taurus SE - A joy to drive.  Ours came packaged with all the essential goodies.  Light Convenience group, Electronic temperature control, remote keyless entry with alarm, 24 DOHC engine. and etc, etc.  The car is comfortable and provides a relatively comfortable ride.  The 24 DOHC V6 engine provides all the necessary power to pass when needed.  However, you do suffer some MPG for this increase in horsepower.  There is plenty of leg room, even in the back seats.  And the trunk provides plenty of storage space.  Stereo sounds good, however it could be improved some as far as clarity and bass.  Automatic temperature control is great!  Works like a household thermostat, just set it and leave it.  The best feature is safety.  My wife and kids were rear ended at approximately 40MPH.  The other car suffered about $5000 in damage.  The Taurus suffered about $2500.  The most important cargo, my family, was undamaged.  The rear impact absorbers took the brunt of the impact!  Would I recommend the Taurus?  You better believe it! American Made! Safe! and FUN TO DRIVE!  <br><br>
