            This is my first time to own a small Ford car. I have always had Ford Trucks until I bought this Focus. I can say that I have been quite impressed with this car so far. 

The car came with virtually everything on the options list except for Heated Seats. But you dont really need heated seats here in the South. When I say everything, I mean everything. It has ABS, Traction Control, Leather Seats, Power Moonroof, Automatic Transaxle, Audiophile 6 disc in-dash changer with separate Amplifier and Subwoofer mounted in the trunk. It is a very dark Blue on the outside with Medium Grey Interior. The outside is complimented by a small spoiler on the trunk and fog lights up front. Overall, a nice package to look at. It even has 16 inch wheels with low profile Pirelli Tires as Standard equipment! 

This is a very nice and fun car to drive on a day to day basis. It has a nice steady, somewhat firm ride. Quick steering feel. It will stop on a dime. 

The Ztec 2.0 DOHC engine has a nice sound to it and it also LOVES to rev high. But, it could use about 30 more horsepower to help it out. I read that the 04 Models have a larger engine that puts out almost 145hp, so that should solve that issue. 

I bought this car to save gas and it has done exactly that. I am averaging about 25mpg in the city with an automatic. Better on the Highway. I expect to get a bit better as the car gets more broken in...I only have 1300 miles on it right now.
