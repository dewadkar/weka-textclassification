            After leasing two Mercury Villagers for 4 years, we decided that maybe we should purchase a new van when our lease ran out.  Well December 1998 we went looking for a Dodge Caravan and the dealer let us know that Ford was offering 2.9% financing so we decided to look at the Windstars.  Well I'm glad that I did because I absolutely love my Windstar.  I feel that it is much more roomier and comfotable that the Village ever was.  The only drawback that I regret now is that I didn't get the captains chairs for the middle row.  We had that with the Villager and during that time we had two children in car seats and I thought it was inconvieniet because my older child had to climb over the seat to get in the back but now that they are getting older I find that two seats would definitly be better that one bench seat.  So my next one, will have the captains chairs in the middle.  We also love having the sliding door on the drivers side as well.  We would recommend this vehicle to anyone that was looking to purchase a minivan.  <br><br>
