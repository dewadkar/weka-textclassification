            I had previously written about a 2000 Mustang that I had rented and a friend owns.  I thought I could write about my 1995 convertible just to give an idea of how this car handles over the years.

I bought mine used in 1997 in great shape.  It's a stick, V6 with a spoiler.  Had &lt;30000 miles on it and now has close to 65000.  I usually do driving around town.

The best thing about the mustang is the looks, it's a very sleek looking car but more important than that is how this car 'behaves' over the years.  

I haven't had any work done to this car, except regular maintenance.  When I was buying this car, I had heard a lot of stuff about American cars not doing so well over the years, and especially problems with the Mustang convertible top.  I take the top off and on quite a number of times, and in 3 years never had a problem.  One thing I have noticed in my Mustang (along with quite a few American cars) is that they start squeaking and squealing after a few years. I drive my Mustang really nicely, and these squeaks aren't ones from the door hinges etc, which can easily be taken care of. Sounds like the car is just getting old.

While it is 5 years old, this is something I never see in cars like Accords and Camrys.  Now I would never buy one of those, and prefer my Mustang to those cars, I just wished Ford did a little bit more work on these problems. Overall, the car has worked out great with regular maintenance.
