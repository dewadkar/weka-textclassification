            I just recently ordered a new mustang convertible in the V-6 variety. It is a purchase that I have been saving for for a long time. It had been worth it. Below is why.

Few cars are as all American as the Ford Mustang, to some that is reason enough to give the Mustang consideration as a car purchase.  However, the cost money so let me give you some reasons why you should buy one.

They are fast. I have a V-6 in the convertible 5-speed version. It won't push you back in your seat in a sprint, but it does make 193 Hp with a 5 speed and the top down and that is just fun. The car also handles much better than the Mustangs of old. The suspension is tight, but not punishing. If it only had an independent rear suspension it would be perfect. But then again you don't buy this car to have it ride like an Oldsmobile.

Mustangs come with standard with CD players, a 5 speed, cruise and power everything. What they are lacking is ABS and traction control. You can pick these up as an option. I suggest you do both if only to get the traction control. Other than that, you have everything you need with this car. 

You know if you are Mustang person, and if you are you'll really like this car. I personally think the GT is a little unrefined. It's too loud with it's deep rumble and really doesn't have that much performance considering it has a higher price, lower gas mileage and increased insurance premiums. Not that the GT isn't a fun, it surely is, but you pay a lot for those 70 extra horses. 

If you get either though, you won't be disappointed.
