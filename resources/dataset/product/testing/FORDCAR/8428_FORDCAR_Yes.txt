            i own a '94 splash supercab with the 4.0 v-6. i am completely satisfied wih this truck. i'm not a person who hauls alot of things so the size of the truck bed doesn't bother me that much. its big enough for what i do. this truck is quick. its got some good getty up and go. i have the 2wd model and have had no engine troubles, oil leaks, rust, paint peeling, major failures at all and i'm on 100,000 miles. its a great durable truck. it has rear fold down seats which are very convient for rear passengers, and when the passengers aren't in the back you can fold the seats up and that will improve your storage. now i'm a stereo buff so i put a 10&quot; jl audio sub behind my driver seat and still had plenty of room in the back for a passenger on the passenger side. i bought this truck because it was a very pretty metal flake blue and the engine was tickling my fancy quite nicely. i feel that this would be a perfect truck for someone who isn't looking for major towing loads but maybe for medium to small towing loads. its great for 2-5 people. if you love stereos you could fit 2 12's in the back of this puppy. if youre into performance, this is probably one of the fastest trucks out there stock. and if youre into endurance, this truck has given me no problems at all. <br><br>
