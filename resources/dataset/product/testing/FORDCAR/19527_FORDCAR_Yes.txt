            I previously owned a 1998 Mustang GT 5 speed that I truly loved.  Despite some of its shortcomings, dollar for dollar the '98 GT was a great car, if a little slow.  I traded that car in on a 2001 Lincoln LS for my wife and began missing my muscle car almost immediately.

In September of 2001 I bought a new 2001 Mustang GT with the only option being the automatic transmission.  In November my wife and I took a road trip out to Washington DC and headed back using only secondary roads (like the Blue Ridge Parkway).  The Mustang performed flawlessly.

The 2001 is such a drastic improvement over the 1998 that I owned that I have to break down the improvements in sections.

Engine: 

1998 GT: The engine sounded strong but had no torque down low and ran out of breath over 4000 rpm.  It provided lackluster acceleration when compared to the GM twins - Camaro and Firebird.

2001 GT: The minute I got behind the wheel at the dealership I noticed the power difference right away.  The car pulls much harder from low rpms and breathes a little easier above 4K rpm, although not as easily as the Cobra with its magnificent DOHC 32-valve motor.  Still, a huge improvement over the '98.

Suspension:

1998 GT: the ride was fine.  It was firm but never harsh and the handling was woefully inadequate for a car with sporting intentions.  Understeer is the name of the game.

2001 GT: the ride seems improved and the handling feels a little sharper but it's still far from an excellent handler.  Thankfully there is a huge aftermarket to help me fine tune this part (Griggs, Maximum Motorsports, etc.).

Brakes:

1998 GT: Sadly my '98 did not have the optional ABS (should have been standard equipment anyway).  The brakes were ok but I felt that a car that heavy with that kind of performance should have had larger brakes.  My old VW Corrado weighed in close to 400 pounds less and had brakes just as big.

2001 GT: ABS and traction control take all the worries out of driving in the rain.  The traction control can be turned off for competitive driving (I autocross) but during the typical rainy summers in Florida, it's a very welcome addition.  The two piston calipers with ABS improved braking considerably over the old car but I still think it needs a little more swept area, especially if you plan to drive it aggressively like at an autocross or driving school.  The Cobra's 13" front rotors are an easy bolt-on and will be replacing my tiny front brakes in the near future.

Other than that, the car feels the same.  As it should, the dash remains the same except for some minor changes.  The seats are just as bad as the ones on my '98.  This was corrected by replacing the miserable front seats with a pair of aftermarket Recaros (Best money spent on the car so far).

My car currently has 21,xxx miles and I could not be happier.  Sure, the quality could be better, the seats SHOULD be better and the styling, which is a manner of personal preference, is quite nice.  I have been just as happy with this Mustang as my wife has been with the two previous Mustangs she owned.

It's unsophisticated, crude and does not make a whole lot of sense these days but the minute you get behind the wheel and step on the gas, all your worries are forgotten.  This car is a blast to drive and incredibly cheap to maintain.
