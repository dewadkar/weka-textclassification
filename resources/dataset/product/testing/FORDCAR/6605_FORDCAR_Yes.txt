            I have recently purchased a 1999 Ford F-150 and thought I would share my opinion on it. This is a very reliable vehicle, however, the 4.2L V-6 engine makes it a little too light for any real work.  If you are going to purchase a F-150, the Triton V-8 is a must.  It has a lot of room behind the seat, but if you are going to have more than two people in the vehicle, then a super-cab would be a wiser investment, as the middle passenger gets very uncomfortable on long trips.  This is a solid truck with lots of space in the back.  The fuel economy is average, around 20mpg.  The warranty seems good on it, but I will update that if I ever have to use it.  The handling on this truck is supurb, although it took a few days to get used to.  The 5-speed transmission handles quite good, but I'm sure an automatic is just as good.  Overall, I would have to give this vehicle a 7 out of 10 as it is a little too light for my liking, and now that I'm in it I wish I had a 4x4 <br><br>
