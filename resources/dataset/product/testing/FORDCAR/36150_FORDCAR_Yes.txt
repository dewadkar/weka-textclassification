            So, here I am, shopping for my 1st brand new car, and not really getting anywhere.  I keep seeing the Ford Focus, but it just seemed so small.  I finally decide, &quot;It won't hurt to take a look.&quot;  I was in love.  

Although the exterior makes it look like a small car, the Focus is anything but small.  The interior is very large, with a molded dash which gives more viewing through the windshield.  The back seat is enormous compared to the size the car seems, and it is so comfortable to drive.

It handles like a dream. Security is definitly felt when you're in this car.  The steering wheel is thick and leather wrapped, which makes for a good grip and the stereo system, while not the best, is very nice.  It has good sound quality.  The only thing I didn't like, was that power windows were 300 dollars, and it doesn't come with an arm rest standard.

The arm rest also if you feel you need it, is a little cheesy.  It's very skinny, and you can't fit much inside it.  Other than that, The car is perfect in my opinion.  It's not a giant beast, and it's not a peanut, either.  It's really the perfect size, and it has just about everything you could ask for in a car.  

The radio and mileage indicators are all digital, and the a/c has a rapid cooldown button for those nasty summers we sometimes get here in Houston.  It also comes standard with power, remote entry locks and power mirrors.  Anyway, I would recommend this car to anyone that asked.  I love mine and would never need anything else in a car.<br><br>
