            I bought my Ranger used with 64k miles, I wasn't intending to buy such a new truck, as I was needing it for work. I found it for a good price, and I do like the body style alot better than the '93-'97 Rangers.

The truck has the poor little 3.0 V6, I wish I would have gotten a 4.0, but the 3.0 gets the job done. When I bought the truck several months ago, I would get 17-17 MPG (mostly country back roads). Now that the weather is warmer, I'm getting 18-19mpg, which isn't too bad, but could be better. 

It does have the four door option, which I've found to be very handy. I'm always putting stuff in the back, and with the extra doors, I don't need to always be tipping my seat back forwards. Much easier to get tools and other heavy items in and out.

The two small jump seats in the back are too small and crowded for anything but small children, but since I almost always am the only one riding in the truck, they haven't been a problem.

The Ranger rides very nicely, I put new shocks on it, as the old ones were worn out. Very smooth and comfortable, much better than our Corolla.

Overall, I'm very happy with my truck. I wouldn't consider buying anything any other model of compact pickup. I'm working on customizing it, with 16" wheels, a Borla exhaust, better audio, etc. I've heard of Rangers with over 200k miles, and even one with over half a million. With good care and maintenance, I hope mine will last that long!
