            My third of four cars, the GT compares well with most of the others.  
THE GOOD
The car has plenty of power, more than you need and enough to get into lots of trouble.  Inexperienced drivers (especially those who think they're hot stuff and really aren't) are eventually going to do something stupid in a rear-wheel drive V8 automobile.  This is a given and should be taken into consideration if you're shopping for somebody who's not yet of legal drinking age or older.  But for those who know what they're doing behind the wheel, the Mustang's present V8 is a beautiful thing.  Acceleration is very responsive, and if you tighten the throttle cable about a quarter inch or so (very easy) you don't even really have to push the pedal, you just think "faster" and you're going faster.  It's great.
The 1996-1998 exterior styling is still, I think, the best looking Mustang since the sixties, all curvaceous and sexy like a pony car should be.  The rear window is glass instead of plastic like a lot of smaller convertibles.  
With the top down, wind noise is surprisingly low for a convertible and the front seat passengers don't have a lot of wind buffet to worry about.  The rear seat passenger, if you're silly enough to put one back there, will be experiencing a realistic simulation of the early days of barnstorming.  But you're not going to put anybody back there anyway.
For a Ford, the A/C system is remarkably efficient, especially considering that convertibles are hard to climate-control anyway. I never really lived in a climate where I used the heat much but it worked fine when necessary.
I only had one minor maintenance problem with this car.  Of course, I was in love with this car and treated her like one of my better girlfriends, so this may have helped.  Take care of her and she'll treat you right... That was my biggest fear when I bought this car to replace my Honda--Fords have terrible maintenance problems, or at least that's my expectation.  The only thing that went wrong was a short in a line somewhere in the emissions control unit.  This needed a dealership computer to fix, but it was not a problem that actually required fixing--unless you don't like having the "check engine" light on all the time.
Let's face it, you look good driving this car.  You feel good driving this car.  You put the top down and everybody around is immediately consumed with envy.  You will be in love with this car, despite:
THE BAD
Most of the interior is cheap plastic.  Not as cheap as the Camaro or Firebird, but cheap and not very comfortable.  I added a 2" foam brace to the left armrest, which made it much more comfortable but wouldn't be necessary in a better-designed car.  
Because there's so much cheap plastic, the car will develop rattles.  By 60,000 miles the rattles were not bad or constant but intermittent and partially dependent upon what was on the radio (Metallica=rattles; NPR=no rattles).  These might get worse, or not.  Tough to say.
The stiff racing suspension, great for some things, is not good on poor quality roads such as you might find in, oh, Del Rio, Texas.  You will feel every pothole and crack in the pavement in this car, though not as bad as in some.  This car should be driven on good smooth roads as much as possible.
We'll just admit now that there's no room in the backseat.  This is not a four-passenger car despite the fact that the seats are shaped as if two people could sit in the back.  Three is the max, and the third person needs to sit on one side and put their feet on the other.  Use both seatbelts.  You would do well to consider this a two-seater with extra space in the back for cargo.  You'll use it because...
The trunk is, as you would expect from a convertible, tiny. It is in fact small even for a convertible because the Mustang design limits the size of the trunk even in hardtop models.  Again, if you're shopping for a convertible or sports car, you've already resigned yourself to this fact (or you'd better, soon).
The car should come with an alarm.  You can push a button on the keychain and the horn will honk, so you'll feel like you've done something, but the car should come with an alarm and does not.  After all, it's a sharp looking machine.  People want to steal them.
Visibility to the rear and sides is fairly limited with the top up.  It is not as bad as the Camaro/Firebird, which feels like a cave, but high-speed lane changes require extra vigilance on your part. The transmission on my car (her name, of course, was Sally) could be a bear when shifting into reverse with a cold car.  Of course, you always shift into reverse first thing in the morning to get out of your garage, so this was a common occurrence.  The transmission does not like to shift into reverse.  This problem was getting worse as I passed 60,000 miles. 
The oil filter is nigh on impossible to get to.  If you change your own oil this will give you fits every time.  It's very badly designed.  Likewise for the oil filler nozzle.  You will have to purchase one of those long curved funnels if you change your own oil or find that you need to add oil from time to time.
The glove box is too small.  It's so awkwardly shaped inside that you can't even fit the owner's manual into it.  I hope the engineer responsible for this has been fired.Despite all of the foregoing, I absolutely loved this car.  But then there was...
THE UGLY
Driver negligence and the poor roads in rural Oklahoma ultimately resulted in my killing this wonderful machine long before her time was up.  But there was good in this awful experience.
I rolled the car over.  She hit a fenceline and flipped.  It was a one-in-a-million chance and, frankly, I'd never, EVER expect anyone else to roll a Mustang.  The center of gravity is about three inches off the pavement.Fortunately for my neck, I had put the top up literally two miles before this accident occurred.  The car rolled over and came to a rest on her top.  The windows and windshield provided a bit of stiffness, but the top itself held its shape amazingly well and I found myself suspended in my seatbelt with at least two or three inches of clearance above my head.  
Needless to say I walked away from an accident I should not have walked away from.  I credit a lot of things for this, but undeniably the sturdiness of Ford's convertible top is a part of my good luck.  If for no other reason I'd recommend a Mustang to anyone who's looking at a drop-top.
