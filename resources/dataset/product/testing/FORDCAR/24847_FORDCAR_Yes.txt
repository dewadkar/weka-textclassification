            I have always owned Firebirds, Trans Ams, or Camaros.  I always liked the body style and the fact that they are fast.  I do not like the 2000 Camaros and was told by the dealer that Camaros will be discontinued in 2 years.  So, I went looking. 

 The only car which appealed to me was the 2000 Mustang Convertible.  After driving it, I was in love.  It is fast and responds well.  I enjoy driving this car.  It has a great sound system, a nice interior and a smooth ride -- and, it is fast! 

 I do not like the driver's seat.  They certainly could have designed it better in my opinion.  You can move the seat to your preference, but, unfortunately, I have never been able to position that seat to comfortably fit my height.  I am not a tall person.  Just can't get that seat to suit me. 

 If you don't like fast cars, don't get a Mustang GT.  You will constantly watch your speedometer and not enjoy the ride.  While I don't &quot;speed,&quot; I must have a car with some &quot;punch.&quot;  My Mustang will get me out of harm's way if necessary.  And, I love the wind in my hair!<br><br>
