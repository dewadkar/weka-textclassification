            I have owned to Ford Escort's in my life.  I bought these because they were older models and very cheap.  I soon found out why they were so cheap.  I used my first Escort (an 85 model) to commute over 60 miles to work.  I found it to be very easy to drive and extremely comfortable.  The problem was, that the clutch disk wore out on it.  Being a front wheel drive vehicle the repairs cost over $600 on a $30 part.  Most people prefer not to drive a standard anyway, so this won't matter to you.  My biggest piece of advice for this car is DON'T BUY A STANDARD.  The repairs are extremely difficult for the home mechanic and extremely high in a shop.  Secondly, I have found that the smaller 1.6 liter engine is far more fuel effecient and reliable than it's 1.9 liter counterpart.  The difference in power between these two engines is practically unnoticeable. All in all a decent car, just make sure you don't pay too much.<br><br>
