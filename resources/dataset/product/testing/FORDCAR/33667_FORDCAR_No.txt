            We got our second escort a few years ago, but i'm not exactly sure why.  They are very light, but the engines are not very strong.  If you get four or five full grown people in the car, it definately struggles going up big hills.  It seems very much like a golf cart in the way that it feels and drives.  It zooms around town and handles well, but it isn't anything special.  some of the advantages are that it is very reasonably priced and it has very good gas efficiency so it is pretty cheap to keep running.  This car is good for someone in a city who will not have much to lug around nor have many passengers to drive around. <br><br>
