            I bought my Ford Ranger because I wanted a compact truck that had good bed space and towing abilities. I have to say, these trucks have to got to be some of the BEST automobiles ever produced by Ford. I say this, and I don't even have a brand new 2000 version of the truck.  I bought a 1992 beige Ford Ranger. I love this car.  It has never once been in the shop, and I don't think it ever will be.  

Now, if you were looking for  a truck for heavy duty work, then honestly I would not recommend a Ranger, b/c of their size.  Although, if you just love trucks, and need it to carry stuff only sparingly, then this is the truck for you.  They are sporty, fun, compact, and VERY easy to drive.  

Now, some things I LOVE about my Ford Ranger is the automatic transmission, power windows, power locks, it's reliability, and how easy it is to adjust to.  There really is only ONE thing I hate about my car, and that's the fact that it has no extended cab feature, but anyone purchasing a Ranger could easily choose one with that included.  That is basically all the info about my Ford Ranger, and if you're looking at compact trucks, I strongly suggest you think of purchasing a Ford Ranger.<br><br>
