            After owning a Bronco II and 3 Explorers we couldn't wait for the Expedition to become available.  We ordered the car as a 2WD, XLT with leather, 6 pack CD, Prem sound, rear air, running boards, larger OWL tires and the 4.6 engine.  It has worked out to be the best car we have ever owned.  It is a pleasure to drive on a trip.  Very quiet and comfortable.  Gas mileage on trips runs 21 or so and the power band is acceptable.  We have driven this vehicle 60,000 miles in just 3 years.  This is a record for us.  I just replaced the OEM tires (Goodyears) @ 59,600 miles and although the tread looked good I was losing confidence in their ability to perform in the wet.  This is by far the highest mileage I have ever achieved with OEM tires. 

We have not had to take this car to the shop yet for any thing except routine service.  It still looks and drives as good as the day I got it. I have thought some about trading for a new one but there is not enough difference to support the cost.  I also bought the extended warranty when it was new.  (6 year / 100,000 mile full warranty) This is also a consideration is keeping it longer than usual. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone that is looking for a full sized SUV.   <br><br>
