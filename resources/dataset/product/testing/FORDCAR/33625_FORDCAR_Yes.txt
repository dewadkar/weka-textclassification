            Having spent the last two days about nonstop in my oldest daughter�s new car, I finally feel that I am qualified to write a review about her 1998 Ford Escort ZX2 Sport Coupe. My father took her shopping for her new car, and since he would be co-signing for her, it was very important that he approve of the car she was purchasing. They found this particular Escort at our local Ford dealer, and they gave her a three year extended warranty on it.  It had been a program car, meaning that it was more than likely used as a rental car, but it only had 17,000 miles on it. My father talked the salesman down to $9100.00 to get the payments down to what my daughter could afford.

Now this is a really sporty looking car, nothing like the Escorts of days gone by. This car actually looks like a cross between a new Mustang and a new Taurus. My daughters car is a two door Sport Coupe, and has a small spoiler on the trunk lid and a small ground effect spoiler under the front bumper. And if any of you happened to read my review on Nationwide Insurance, these two little items, turned my daughters car insurance bill into a nightmare. But that is another Epinion.

This particular Escort is a metallic green color, but I have seen the same car in a variety of other colors from blue to a copper color. It can also come in a four door style, and with no Sport package. These cars all have a 4 cylinder, 130 horsepower, 2.0 liter dual overhead cam engine and are front wheel drive. With a 5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic transmission. Dual air bags, keyless entry and anti-lock brakes are options. My daughters� Escort has the automatic transmission and all of the options. The interior of her car is gray, both front seats will lay back into a reclining position and the rear seat will fold down in two separate sections to access the trunk. This is also useful if you want to haul something a little long in the trunk. The trunk of this car is fairly large, which was actually a surprise for a car as small as this.

Now on to my driving experiences with this car, in the past two days I have driven in this car in every driving condition imaginable, with the exception of snow, and put about 900 miles on.

Let me start with driving this car in normal driving conditions on just two lane highways, slightly curving and fairly flat. Excellent, this car handles the curves well, will shift into overdrive when pulling a hill, but will not drop below the speed limit of 55. I was well pleased with the car in this situation.

Interstate, again normal driving conditions, no rain, slightly mountainous terrain. While the car had no major problems, semi�s have a tendency to move this car around on the road slightly. I was traveling 65 (the speed limit), but the truck drivers felt the need to travel faster. Since I was traveling alone with my four year old, I was comfortable doing the speed limit. When a semi comes up behind the car, you can feel the back end lift slightly, then when along side, it will push you slightly to the edge of the road, when the semi pulls in front of you, it will actually pull you along for a little way. I know that you can get this feeling with just about anything you drive, but it seemed more exaggerated with this smaller car. Also when you start into the mountains, this car does seem to shift a lot more, and does lose a little speed. Again, about what I would expect with a small four cylinder car.

Interstate driving in rainy, foggy conditions. Again I could feel every large vehicle that was passing me, only this time, everything was passing me. Since this car is so small and low to the ground, the water laying on the roads was thrown on the windshield from the passing semi�s, so badly, that I spent most of the time going 45 miles per hour so I could at least see something. We even put in new wiper blades thinking that this may help my vision, but it did not. In this department I was not pleased with the car at all, as a matter of fact, I felt down right in danger.

Two lane mountainous roads in high fog and rain. Here I could travel a little more comfortably since I was not being passed all of the time. The built in fog lights on this car are excellent, I am talking pea soup thick fog, and I was still able to see the road well enough to travel at a fairly decent speed. While again the car did seem to lose some power on the large hills, I have come to expect this with a four cylinder.

While the car is small, the seats are comfortable for short trips. But after spending four hours in the drivers seat, my legs and back end were starting to get a little cramped.
All window, radio, wiper and heater controls are within easy reach of the driver. And the stereo does have a nice sound, my daughters� Escort came with an AM/FM, Cassette player.

The two door version of this car was built for people with no children, but since my four year old is in a booster type car seat now, it was really no problem to place the car seat in the rear seat of the car. She can get in it herself, and I did have to step one foot in the back seat to buckle the belt. Because of the air bag I could not allow her to ride up front with me. The four door model would be fine for people needing to hook up car seats.
Also traveling with four adults in the two door version can be slightly cramped. But for short distances it is not too bad, other than entering and exiting.

For the most part, I was very pleased with the performance of this car, with the exception of the interstate rain travel. It is estimated that these new Escorts get 33 miles per gallon for highway driving and 26 miles per gallon for city driving. And from my calculations this is about right. It does get excellent gas mileage, and the handling on most roads is wonderful. But I would not recommend these cars if you happen to do a lot of long interstate driving in poor weather conditions. But for what my daughter does, which is mainly local driving, it is an excellent car for her. Looks sporty enough for a 20 year old girl to feel good in, plus with the excellent gas mileage it does not cost her much to drive. Which is a good thing, since between her car payment and insurance payment she does not have a lot of money left over at the end of the month.<br><br>
