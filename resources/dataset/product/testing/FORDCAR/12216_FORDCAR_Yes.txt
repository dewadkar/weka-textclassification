            I needed a car with a lot of space.  When I went to purchase a used car, I wasn't looking for style, or color...I just wanted to fit comfortably behind the wheel, and have someone be able to sit behind me.  I couldn't believe how much room I had left around me after getting in for the first time.  
My T-Bird is a brilliant turquoise color.  I couldn't believe how pretty it looked.  Although it's a medium sized car, it still has that sporty look and feel to it.  The seats are very comfortable.  In mine, everything is electric and fully adjustable.  And this car has a lot of gutt!  Even the rear defrost is fast.  
The nicest thing about the Thunderbird...the insurance companies have no problem with handing out lower rates to cover.  It handles nicely in all weather conditions.  The heaviness of the body helps in the snow as well.  Although, because of it's ability to pick up speed quickly, you have to have good tires.  The stearing is highly responsive, and the car takes corners well.
Flaws: Not a lot of leg room in the back.  Short legged folks are Ok in the back, but probably not for long drives.  <br><br>
