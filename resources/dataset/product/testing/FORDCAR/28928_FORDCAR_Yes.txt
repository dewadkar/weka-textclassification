            Well I would not get a two(2)wheel drive and then complain about that it is not a good offroad vehicle, when in fact, this vehicle is a lot better than you describe it to be,and about your shock issue? just like you said&quot;I bought the v6 because you did not want the four wheel drive(which would have been more use for offroad)?? The one you got is a very nice vehicle or you would not have paid what you paid? And it is also mainly for street use(but will go a lot more places than the blazer would go. or for that fact why would you buy a vehicle without trying it out to see if it is what you want? basically if you wanted a vehicle with stronger shocks and more offroading ability, then you should have bought the four(4) wheel drive instead of the two(2)wheel drive model!!! Thank heaven for some smart people to help people when they do stupid things???Howard D.<br><br>
