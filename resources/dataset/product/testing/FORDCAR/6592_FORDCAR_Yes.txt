               For anyone you wants a vehicle for hauling, towing, offroading, or just wants to plain out smoke them back tires,look no further. I bought my 1999 F-150, supercab XLT shortbase with the 5.4 Triton in August, and I absolutely love it. My previous truck was a 97 F-150, with the 4.2L V6. Even though I love that truck too, I just couldn't pass up the deal on the 99. The engine is awesome, with plenty of torque at low RPM's. It sits up high (even for a 4x2) like a truck should. It handles great, with most of the bumps soaked up by the suspension. Interior is made with good materials that don't look cheap, and looks great also. 4th door makes everything much better for loading stuff in back. The only really negative comments I have is the gas mileage (of course) and wet weather traction. I would recommend this vehicle to any new truck buyer, or any previous F-150 owner who is looking for a fullsize truck. Trust me, you can't go wrong.<br><br>
