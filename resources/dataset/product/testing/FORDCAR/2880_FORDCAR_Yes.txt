            When my parents first went to buy a '93 Escort, they took one look at it, thought about the price, and told the salesman they would take it.

&quot;Without a testdrive?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; they replied.

I've taken over the driving of the vehicle now.  Since they bought it seven years ago, it has undergone all sorts of roads and has acquired 175,000 miles as of this morning.  When I looked at the mileage, I decided that I had to share this feat with others...

The only problem it has had was a worn out fan belt.  Pretty good record, huh?

The only fault I have with it is that the assembly line workers didn't hook up the brake light wires.  Only the top, middle light works.  I've had two policemen warn me about it saying that I need to get it fixed.   (I admit I'm a procrastinator and haven't done so yet...but that's my fault.)

This car will last me several more years I'm sure, but what amazes me the most is even though it was made seven years ago, it still maintains a nice, basic, and attractive style that I'm proud to ride around in!
