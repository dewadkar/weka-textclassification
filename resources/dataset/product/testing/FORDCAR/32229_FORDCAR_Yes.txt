            The reason I chose this topic is because the thing didn't go back far enough. What I realy want to write about is the 1980 Ford Bronco, one of the best and strongest vehicles ever made. The only bummer is gas mileage, but if you are looking at long distance traveling it actually is pretty good. These trucks are built really strong and my family always feels safe and secure when riding in the Bronco. I love knowing that the doors and sidealls and double reinforced steel, and it's fun to take the top off in the summer time and feels like you are in a fancy pickup truck. When you drive a Bronco you feel ike oyu are on the top of the world and nothing can hurt you. People who are experienced drivers,traveling a long distance or living in the mountains should seriously look into buying one of these trucks, look for one in the 80's because they were built stronger back then.<br><br>
