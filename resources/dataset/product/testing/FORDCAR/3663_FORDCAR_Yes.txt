            I had a 1988 Ford LTD Crown Victoria LX for a very short time, 
(8 months). I sold my wonderful 1985 Chrysler Fifth Avenue to my brother since he desperately needed a better car, could not afford a new car and did not trust used car dealers. He knew I took extremely good care of my cars and is still driving the Chrysler with over 130K miles on the odometer. 

My Crown Vic was the upper-level &quot;LX&quot; model, silver metallic with a light half-vinyl roof, burgundy velour interior, with the cast-aluminum &quot;turbine&quot; wheels, white-wall tires and top-of-the line stereo system.  

It had Ford's ultra-reliable 5.0 litre (302 CID) fuel-injected V-8. This engine is very easy to work on. Plugs, wires, etc. are very accessible. Changing the oil is a snap. The car had an awesome heating and air conditioning system. The car heated up instantly in the winter and the air conditioner was so efficient that if run full blast on a long trip, you could freeze to death even on a blazing hot day. The factory stereo had clear crisp sound. It also came with a full-size spare. 

The car handled well for such a large car and gas mileage was respectable. I admired the car's solid construction with its full frame, rear-wheel drive and solid steel bumpers. There was also the added amusement of frightening the driver in front of me since many police departments use Crown Vics. My car could pass as an unmarked police car at a distance.

You may ask, &quot;Well, if this was such a great car, why did you get rid of it so soon?&quot; It was stupid little things that drove me nuts. The grille on the door mounted speaker fell off every time I closed the driver's side door, there was a big gap on the fabric covered C-pillar insert, the plastic covers on the seat belt anchors were forever falling off and worst of all, the dash pad cracked and crumbled over the left speaker leaving a big hole although I Armor-All'd the dash pad religiously. 
I also advise anybody with a velour interior to stock up on lint rollers.

The main reason I got rid of the car was the 1989 Mercury Grand Marquis LS. The Merc is virtually the same car as the Ford, but it is prettier with its Lincoln-esque styling, and seems to be put together a lot tighter than the Ford. I took one look at the Mercury and came back three weeks later to purchase it. I kept the Mercury for 5 years until I traded it for my present 1994 Cadillac DeVille. I never experienced any problems, big or little,  with my Merc and I should have kept it until I ran it into the ground.<br><br>
