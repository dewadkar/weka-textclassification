            I bought a 1999 Crown Victoria LX on 6/30/01 with 37,000 miles on it. At first, I fell in love with the car. The car is great in the city for comfort and quietness over bumps and those other loud noises, but like I said in my cons, it needs more power. The 1999 LX has 200HP standard, but for a 2 Ton+ car, this is barely enough. I have to put the accelerator 1/4 way down to get the car to pick up even reasonably from a stop light to keep up with traffic. Fuel economy is a little off par considering I owned a 1983 Oldsmobile with a 5.0 Liter 307 Engine and got 1MPG better than the smaller engine in the Crown Vic did (probably due to weight). However, this car has pretty much proven to me that it is practicaly indestructible. The weight and *acceptable* power of this car proves that it is one of the last real American full-size sedans on the road with comfort, features, passenger comfort (BIG CAR) and all-around good drivability. For anyone that wants a big car, I would *highly* recommend the Crown Victoria by Ford. I love it even though I bought it used!!!
Passenger space is more than excellent depending on the height of the driver and passenger and is well suited for 6 people.
