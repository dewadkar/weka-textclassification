            I purchased a 2000 Taurus SE August 14th , 2000. My reasons to go to a Ford dealership were varied. I have had two Ford vehicles in the recent past. Most recently was  a Ford Escort Wagon, 1992, and prior to that a 1987 Ford (Mercury) Sable. Both cars went well over 150,000' with out any problems.

Another reason for my Ford choice was the location and cleanliness of &quot;COLUMBIA Ford&quot;.(Columbia CT)

As for my new car...the 2000 I bought is Gold, with leather seats and a few accessories. The handling of the car is very good. Steering seems smooth and accurate. The suspension is tight and handles country roads as well as highway driving extremely well.

The overall &quot;new&quot; look of this 2000 Taurus is different from the 1999.  There is a square trunk where as the prior years model had a smoothed front and rear. The new Taurus reminds me of the 1999 Lincoln Continentals. Very nice!

Acceleration is good. (Though, the 24 valve is better).  When A/C or Defrost are in use the acceleration is diminished noticeably. Both work well and the Max AC is terrific, and more economical than regular A/C.

I have searched and looked for any and all problems with my new car to be sure to have all corrections/problems repaired or fixed immediately. 
BUT alas, I have yet to have a problem. 

My biggest criticism is the car comes with FIRESTONE Tires.
