            The Ford Ranger is  sharp looking truck and provides a comfortable ride.  I t has been great for getting back and forth to work and has been very reliable.  However if you want to pass someone the four cylinder engine does not provide enough power to do it without downshifting, and I would always hesitate before trying to pass on an up hill slope.  Overall the paint seems to be holding up very well as are the factory alloy wheels.  Braking and handling provide no major complaints  If you are looking to do heavy hauling this is not recommended though it should do fine with the 6 cylinder version.  This is going to be  a wonderful starter vehicle for my son when he turn sixteen next year.
