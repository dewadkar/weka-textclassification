            V-10 power. Oh its so cool. But the gas mileage. You know this truck is as nice as they come. 

I have 90,000 miles on my f-150 and its never been to the shop. I expect the same from the 250. My buddy has replaced his Dodge tranny twice since I bought the 150. 

Leather seats(id get the buckets if I had it to do over. Went out to courtesy ford in Colorado. They sell more Ford pickups than anyone in the country. They sell em cheaper too. It doesn't have as good a suspension as the f-150, the turning radius is horrible. Parking difficult, But for my money thereï¿½s not another truck made that can tow, Haul, turn heads, and hold up like my 250.  


Boy I wish Priceline hadn't quit the webhouse/gasoline deal. I'd really get the diesel if I was you.
