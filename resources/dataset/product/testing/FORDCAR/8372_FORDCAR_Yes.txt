                 My husband and I ventured out to buy our first new (used) car together a year and a half ago.  We were the model car shoppers.  We spent a week going to many different car lots, looking at hundreds of cars, and test driving more than our share of cars, trucks, and SUV's.  But when I set my eyes on a shiny silver Ford Explore XL, I was done shopping.  <b>This</b> was the vehicle for me.

     After a year and a half, I can honestly say that I still love my Explorer.  Besides just looking nice inside and out, it has several other features that I love:

     <b>Easy To Operate</b>
   The Ford Explorer is easy to drive.  All of the important controls (windshield wipers, cruise control, air etc..) are close to the driver and easy to operate.  It doesn't have a million fancy gadgets you'll never figure out how to use.

     <b>Room, Room, Room</b>
   This SUV will comfortably seat five people and still have cargo room in the back.  I have no problem piling the month's groceries in the back, and the rear gate makes it even easier.  For those really large loads, the back seat can be folded down to provide extra room.

     <b>Durable</b>
   Our Explorer goes camping with us every summer.  It easily tackles the rough terrain of the Idaho forests.  The 4 wheel drive also helps for those snowy winters and icy roads.  It also withstood numerous outings with our eighty pound German Shepard.

     <b>Reliable</b>
   I drove this car 250 miles a day, three days a week, for a year while I was going to college.  I never had any problems other than it seemed to guzzles the gas, but most SUV's do.

     &quot;Is there any downside?&quot; your probably asking.
My only problem is that the back seat tilts back which makes it more comfortable for passengers, but makes it hard to keep a rear-facing carseat level.  You have to place a towel under the front of the carseat.  As soon as they can face forward, it is not a problem.  If you don't have any children in carseats, then it definitely isn't a problem. :~)

     I will put up with this one small inconvenience for all the other joy my Explorer has brought me.
