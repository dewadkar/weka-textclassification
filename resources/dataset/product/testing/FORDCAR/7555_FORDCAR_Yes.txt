            We bought &quot;big red&quot;, a 1998 Ford Expedition 4WD Eddie Bauer to replace my aging 1989
 Bronco  4WD XLT. I'm a Ford guy from way back, with my share of speeding tickets from
street racing '65  mustangs.

Big Red (my wifes name for the truck; I just call it &quot;the truck&quot;) is intended to support and
complement our lifestyle, activities, outings and our need to &quot;go buh bye&quot; -- we love road
trips.  Not counting the gas mileage (17-19 MPG cruising, 12-14 towing the boat) this is 
a great truck to take on short and long trips alike.  Tons of room inside, plus a sturdy roof
rack.  The gas mileage isn't a concern for us, since I commute less than 5 miles to &amp; from
work each day; all the gas is used up on weekends.

We opted for the Eddie Bauer trim package, since it offered several things we liked that 
are not available in other packages.  It made me mad that ford forces you to the 
top-of-the-line truck just to add a few simple features: the power-flip rear windows help
move air thru the truck, and the sunroof is a must-have in southern california.  We also
chose the heated seats (which my wife thought was a dumb idea; until the first ski trip and 
subsequent cold butt), the CD changer and the towing package.

We didn't get the third read seat, because it's too small for any normal human to sit in, 
and the extra room in back is much more convenient.  Besides, storing the rear seat when 
it's not in use is tough.  Adding the sunroof deletes the overhead console &amp; rear-air
conditioner, but without the rear seat, you don't need the rear air.  We like to take our two
dogs on trips, and folding-down the middle seats leaves plenty of space for luggage, 
&quot;stuff&quot; and 230 lbs of rotweiler.   There is also room for 4x8 sheet goods from the lumber 
yard, but the back hatch  won't close; I've carried a lot of plywood with the rear hatch tied 
to the  trailer hitch.  Use an old pillow between the hatch and the stuff you're carrying, to 
protect  the hatch.

Driving the truck is like driving my livingroom; comfy, adjustable leather seats, air
conditioning, good sound system and a great view.  The side-view mirrors are a bit small 
for my taste,  especially compared to the elephant-ear mirrors that the bronco had. 

For towing, the 5.4 liter triton V8 is somewhat underpowered, especially up steep grades.
Switching off the overdrive and shifting into second provides a plenty-powerful 60 MPH
up the steepest hills, which is tolerable, but I sure wish for about 75 more horsepower and 
additional  torque.  Maybe a bolt-on supercharger is in the future; who knows. 

We also opted for four-wheel drive, since the bronco had that, and it's come in handy 
several  times a year, either pulling someone who is stuck, or to avoid getting stuck myself. 
Strap tire chains to all four wheels, and it's an unstoppable way to get to the ski resorts 
in style.

At the time we were shopping, expeditions were very popular, and it was hard to find what
we wanted on a dealer lot.  We ended up ordering one, using the AAA pre-negotiated price
offered  by an AAA approved Ford dealer.

The truck is a bit over 1 year old, with 17K miles, and no problems.  Recommended.
