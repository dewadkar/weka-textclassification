            In February, 2000 I ordered a 2000 Excursion XLT with the optional diesel engine.  Three months later, Ford still had not picked the order to build the vehicle.  It was then that I sold my '98 F-150, and I was now stuck without a vehicle.  The dealer had an XLT with the XLT upgrade package, but with the V-10.  They gave me a great deal, so I bought the V-10 instead of continuing to wait for the diesel.  Also, I am a bit of a do-it-yourselfer, and the service requirements of the V-10 are much easier that the diesel.

I have a 27' travel trailer that I was towing with the F-150.  It was equipped with the 5.4L V-8, but it struggled in Northeastern PA, where the interstates and turnpike are more like a roller-coaster than anything else.  I needed something that could handle my trailer (up to 7600 lb.), my three children, and the power to pull back up the other side of the mountain.  So far, the V-10 seems to do the job.

I love the roominess of the vehicle.  In the second row seat, three adults sit comfortably.  They have more than enough leg room, and the access in and out of the vehicle is great.  The third row seat is a little narrower, but can still fit three people.  The only drawback to this seat is foot room.  Your heel is against the platform for the seat (probably there to raise the body above the frame to make room for the 44 gallon fuel tank), plus your toes are stuck in the mechanisms for the second row seats.

The cargo options are many.  There is plenty of room behind the third seat.  This time of year, I constantly have my own personal softball equipment plus a Little League team's equipment.  This stays behind the third seat.  If I need additional room, I can simply fold down the second row seat, and have a lot of additional room, without removing the third row seat.  Finally, I can remove the third row seat, which is on rollers, and is incredibly light for its size.  This gives me a full 4' x 8' cargo area.

I would not recommend this vehicle equipped with the optional 5.4L V-8.  That engine is fabulous (I had it in my '98 F-150), but would labor too much moving this large Excursion.  Then, towing would be out of the question.  When making a decision to purchase, two things need to be weighed heavily;  the performance/economy of the diesel vs. the ease of maintenance on the V-10.

The diesel requires the same oil change frequency as the V-10, but the filter costs approx. $10, and it takes 15 quarts of specially formulated oil at approx. $1.40 per quart, for a total DIY cost of about $31.  I have heard stories of people getting up to 20 MPG with the diesel, but I have a relative with the same engine, and he gets about 16 MPG, whether empty or towing.  Plus, there are other items with the diesel, such as changing the fuel filter every 20K at a cost of about $80.  And accidentally run the fuel tank empty?  Good luck getting it started.

On the flip side, a DIY oil change on the V-10 cost about $7.50, and there is very little other periodic maintenance other than air filters, etc. that would also be required with the diesel.  However, running empty. I am getting about 11.5 MPG.  When towing, I get about 9 MPG.  This is still acceptable.  With the 44 gal. fuel tank, the range is still almost 400 miles.  (With my F-150 with the 5.4L V-8 I was only getting 7.5 MPG, with a 25 gal. tank, my range was only about 180 miles.)

Many people are critical of the Excursion's size.  When it is sitting in a parking lot, it looks massive.  But in reality, it is only 4&quot; longer than my F-150 that I had previously (F-150, SuperCab, short box).  Therefore, there are a lot of longer vehicles on the road, specifically all of those trucks out there with SuperCabs and 8' boxes.  The Excursion fits into my standard size garage, but the radio antenna hits a little hard.

So far, my biggest complaint is real petty.  I feel that most of the people that will purchase and Excursion will also be towing, they could have made it easier to mount a brake unit.  There is absolutely nowhere that I like to mount the unit.  I like to hit some solid metal in the dash, and there is none available.  Also, the location of the wiring plug under the dash is less than desirable.  Finally, you must realize that this is built on the Ford SuperDuty chassis, and when the rubber meets the road, especially the rough road, the ride is a little rough.  A lot of the panels inside give a good rattle and shake when you go over some rough road or railroad tracks.

Who should buy an Excursion?  Someone who needs to move a lot of people, or a lot of cargo and still need room for people.  It is a great family vehicle.  Since I bought the Excursion, all three of my children want to take it instead of my wife's 2000 mini-van.  If you are faint of heart at the gas pump, don't buy it.  Every time I fill up, it cost over $50, and I have not really run it down.  All in all, the Excursion is an excellent vehicle.  On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 9.<br><br>
