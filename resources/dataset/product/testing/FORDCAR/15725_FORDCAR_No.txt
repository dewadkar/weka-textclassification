            This van is great for families who have several kids with lots of friends. It is safe and comfortable, but it has had MANY MAJOR reliability problems over the past years, and has NOT been driven that much. Seriously investigate reliability before purchasing. The options you have to buy to make this a decent car (power windows, locks) make the price uneccisarily high. Overall, I would not purchase this vehicle without some kind of statement/guarantee/additional insurance from Ford. But I must say, this van has tons of cargo room and seating comfort, especially with the captain seating option. We bought this vehicle to haul seven people around town, but we have used it for schelpping ping pong tables, trampolines, and more. <br><br>
