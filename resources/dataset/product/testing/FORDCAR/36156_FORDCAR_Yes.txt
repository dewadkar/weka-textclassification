            I have, admittedly, been a Ford driver since I was 18 ten years ago. At first I drove crappy Escorts and Tempos because that was all I could afford. But then I had a Mystique followed by a 99' Cougar--the little sporty one.
While I enjoyed driving the Cougar with it's smooth five-speed transmission and throaty V6, I wanted a car with better gas mileage and had come to admire the Volkswagen Golf a lot. So when the lease was up I went to the Volkswagen web site and configured me a Golf. It said I could have that fine little car for about $16k. I printed out the web page and carried it in my eager clutches to the VW dealer.
I test drove a Golf and liked it fine. I sat with the dealer and proudly showed him my web page. &quot;I would like this car,&quot; I said with a big smile.
Well, don't ask me what twisted dealer math they used, but somehow the dealer managed to make that $16k bad-boy total a much-less-acceptable $21k! Frustrated at this seemingly false advertising experience, I drove to my Ford dealer and checked out the Ford Focus, which was the only car that I felt looked near as cool as the Golf.
I test drove a ZX3 with a 5-speed manual and....I...loved it! Not only did it drive better than that Golf did, what with the smooth, short-throw shifter, its tight, variable assist steering and control-blade rear suspension, but it was so comfortable to drive that it made me feel relaxed just sitting in it. The interior space was noticably roomier than my Cougar or even the old Mystique I had. And this was SUPPOSED to be a compact car!
Finally, the price pasted a smile on my face I still sport when writing checks to Ford Credit. A slim $14k, fully loaded. Power windows, CD player, remote entry with chip-on-key security and plenty of power.
For the environmentally conscious, the car gets 25-30mpg depending on your driving habits, and qualifies as a LEV (low emissions vehicle).

I have had so much more fun with this vehicle than any other car since my old baja-beetle that I would recommend it to anyone interested in a good small car. Test drive it, and you will not be disappointed. There's a reason this car is car of the year in the US and Europe, and why Ford uses these little gems as Rally Racers in the WRC. It's because this is a GREAT car!<br><br>
