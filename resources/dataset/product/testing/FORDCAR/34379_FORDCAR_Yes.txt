            I changed careers 3 years ago and had to drive further to my workplace, therefore it was time to find a car that not only got good gas mileage but had to be comfortable enough to accomodate a 6 foot 6 inch man - me. The Taurus SE has become, over my 30 months of ownership, the perfect answer. 

Not only does the Taurus have a comfortable ride and excellent room, the controls are very easy to locate and use. This Taurus averages 25 miles to each gallon, even though it carries the optional 200 horsepower, 24 valve engine. And believe me, it has more than enough power to get you out of tight places when you need it most. Merging onto the highway? Fuhgeddaboudit because this car will lead you right ahead of the pack. How about braking? Excellent and long lasting. I've driven 54,000 miles and have only used half of the brake lining. All the options were dandy as well. The C.D. changer never skips, the moonroof doesn't leak or give wind noise, ( something you hardly ever hear from other moonroof owners ) the climate control works like the thermostat in your house, and the sound is pretty quiet. Also, the back seat area was nice enough for 3 children without any crampiness. I've taken three 400 mile trips in my Taurus and am happy to report no problems, just an amazing ride.

If you are a big person who needs room, comfort, good gas mileage and aren't looking to spend too much, then the Taurus SE is the perfect car for you. You will be hopefully as happy as I am.
