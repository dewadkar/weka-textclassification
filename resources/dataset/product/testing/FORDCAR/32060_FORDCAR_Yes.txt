            Over the years, my family has owned many vehicles but the one distinct one in my memory is our 4 door 1996 Ford Explorer.
My family has always been a fan of Ford cars ever since my parents first got married. They had many types of Fords, and we own two now. I think that they bought this one because they were so satisfied with the others they had bought. Along with our spruce green 1996 model version of the 4 door Explorer, we also own a 1992 blue version of the Explorer. The only difference is that the 1996 is a newer version and it has more features. Basically, I think my family bought this car because they are so fond of Explorers.
I love a lot of things about the vehicle. I'm not a mechanic or anything, so I can't really get into details. All I can say is it's a great car. The things I love most about it are all the features of it. It is my first car with a CD player, it has a monitor that tells the temperature outside, it has a sunroof (which is optional but still nice) a radio controller in the back and on the steering wheel which are very convenient...and many other features. I also noticed that the vehicle drives very smoothly and I don't think we have ever had a problem with it in the four years we've owned it. Another thing is that it's a very attractive vehicle and I like the look of it.
I can't really say that I hate anything about the car because I can't think of anything wrong with it. I really like it a lot!
Even though I was underage, my parents were still nice enough to let me take the truck for a few spins once in a while. First of all, I like to drive it because it's automatic and that's so much easier than to drive a standard. It's also a very smooth car to drive, and the 4-wheel drive makes it convenient for rough terrain such as the beach. It's a great experience to drive this car...I can see people falling in love with it by just taking it for a test drive!
I think anyone could buy this car. It's a really modern car and I think that anyone would like it. I would even buy it myself! It's not weird looking, so teenagers wouldn't be embarrassed to drive it, and it's also sophisticated looking so parents and even grandparents would be comfortable driving it. The features make it easy for anyone to drive, so I could say it is an all-around perfect vehicle! <br><br>
