            The 2000 Tauri is the best combination of performance and value this year. The new Taurus combines a slight body change with the same great features that have made it a best seller in the past. I just bought a 2000 SES sedan, and I absolutly love it. And keep in mind, I'm a 19 year old college student. The car has room for myself and 3 or 4 friends to pile in and head out on a road trip, yet it still has the performance of a much small sedan. I raced it against my cousin's 2000 Merc Cougar AND SMOKED HIM BY 3 CAR LENGTHS. There simply isn't a better performance sedan on the market (except maybe the SHO) that can still get 25 mpg cruising the highway. I would highly recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
