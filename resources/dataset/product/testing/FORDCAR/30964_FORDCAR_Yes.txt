            I was looking for a simple transportation. I bought a 95 Contour because I think I got a good deal.

I drove a Contour once at 1996 and I was not very impressive. A lot of people rate this car as a American BMW and I don't agree on it. Well it is a German Ford and BMW is German car. They do have the similar attribute. Seat is firm, suspendsion is tight, car is solid. Contour is a 'sedan' like MB C230, Opel Vectra. What make it differ from BMW are the balance of the car, the engine. The V6 has 170 hp but the torque is low for that size of the engine. I believe this is the main reason why the sales figure is low. The engine should be used in German where the speed is usually at 180+ km/h. With 55 mph limit, you need to have a engine has more torque than the V6 on the Contour. Comparing 323 or the pervious generation 325, the BMW has more torque given the size of the engine is about the same size. Behind the wheel the V6 Contour is just like driving a 318. May be the Contour is faster at the high speed.<br><br>
