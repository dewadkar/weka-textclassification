            I just bought a 1997 Ford Explorer with very low miles and fully loaded. I have had nothing bad to say yet, I have had it back to the dealership once and that was for a common problem which was the chain adjusters or tensioner. And the dealership was great. Fast service, no hassles, and even drove me to where i need to be while the were servicing my explorer. Besides that I really have nothing bad to say about the ford explorer. Matter of fact, I really enjoy every aspect of the explorer from the 4 wheel drive, the moon roof, sporty wheels and expecially the great sounding jbl sound system! I give this sport utility two thumbs up!<br><br>
