            I have been using my Ford F-150 for a little over a year now. It is still a dream to turn the engine every time I get in it. I use my truck for outdoor recreation and extensive highway driving. It handles GREAT in the mud and snow. This truck has done everything I have asked of it from towing to climbing sloppy hills and crawling over large rocks to get to remote lakes. Its amazing that a truck so smooth on the highway that looks great, can also plow over and through trails like a tank!
The fuel mileage of my truck is as expected since it is a lot larger than most vehicles on the road. I get about 18 miles to the gallon on the freeway and around 13 in the city. I notice the speed of my truck does not decrease when going over hilly freeway terrain. The Triton V-8 just seems to keep pulling and this is even when I am pulling my camper trailer with an estimated loaded weight of 4200 pounds.
The interior room is plenty and the added rear bench seat is good for carrying the family around or just throwing items I do not want wet or stolen. The rear supercab doors are very handy for quick accessibility to the rear bench seat. 
The stereo with 6 disc changer sounds great and keeps me awake on long journeys to visit relatives when there is no radio signal on long stretches of roadway. The front bucket seats are plenty comfortable as well. It seems as if I cover miles quickly compared to the truck I traded for my new Ford F-150.
All in all I would say this is the best truck I have ever driven and my friends are always wanting to drive it. I feel bad for them.
