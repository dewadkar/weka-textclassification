            The 1999 Ford Explorer is a fantastic car from its looks on the outside to its handling, to its features--you will love it.

When you first approach the Ford Explorer, you will notice a very well designed outside from the very distinguishable wrap-around headlights, to the rear of the car, you will love it.  I my opinion is the Explorer is a complete SUV from the outside.  What I mean by this is that some other SUV's, like the Mercedes and the Lexus look like the designers did not finish the back of the car.

Let us move to what is important, the ride.  When you sit in the Explorer, you will notice that the SUV wraps around the driver.  All the dials are within reach, the gages are easy to see, and everything is well marked.  These features make the driving experience better.

If you are looking for a luxury car, this is not the place to be.  The ride is not going to as smooth as those types of cars.  When you drive over a bump of the car, you will definitely feel it.  However, this only adds to the fun factor of the vehicle.

The acceleration of the Explorer is not as fast as a Jeep, but that does not make a big deal.  In addition, a quick acceleration in this SUV may not be wise because it will waste a lot of gas.  You are not going to see great mileage in the Explorer, however I have found it seems to better than most.

The 1999 Explorer seems to have some problems.  For example the windshield whippers engage at random times which seems to be a large problem in the 1999 model.  Also, the hood was recalled, but I assume any new purchase would have this problem fixed.

Finally, if you are looking for a lot of space, the Ford Explorer has more than any of the other SUV that are in its class.  As you can tell, I really like the Explorer and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a SUV.<br><br>
