            Ok, so I'm anal.  I reviewed all the safety and consumer figures for six months before selecting a car.  And I bought a Mustang.  (again! I've owned a half dozen or so in my driving years.)  I love it.  I have a V-6 with standard transmission.  Even in heavy traffic, it's fun to drive.  My pony car has the Mach stereo system which takes the driving experience to a whole new level.  It is not at all uncommon for someone to glance at me and catch me jammin.  I have a Crystal White hardtop and it sure seems to attract a lot of attention.  Ford really brought back a lot of the same eye catching features in the new bodystyle that gave the classics their appeal.  It's comfortable (except the back seats, but then the back seats of a mustang have ALWAYS been small cramped and uncomfortable.. space isn't why you buy this car!) and handles well.  Getcha one!!!  I've had mine for just over a year... <br><br>
