            More important to me than the road test is the sit test. I am tall and large enough to need a the seat belt extender on an airline. I had read about the Focus Wagon and found one after calling 4 dealers - others had heard and apparently bought them off the lots. There was good headroom and I felt that I was sitting in the car and not wearing it. The seat test passed with great grades.

Next came the road test. This is not the car to buy if you like to hear tires squeal when you start out. It is the car if you like to hold the road and corner without fear. Good suspension, adequate power with the ZTech engine and decent mileage.

After 5000 miles I feel that the decision was good. A good riding and good looking car that makes sense for a commute or pleasure trips in the countryside.<br><br>
