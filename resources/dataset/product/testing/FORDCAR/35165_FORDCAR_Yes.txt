            Having recently moved to VA and in need of a car that was affordable and good I went to ford.  When they said all I could qualify for was an escort I went no... but then they showed me the 2 door sport coupe and I fell in love.  For a two door there is a lot of room inside the car, it only sits four but you all have enough room.  It's a 5 speed and handles wonderful in the snow having been in the desert for 9 years I needed something that would make it through.  It does not look like the typical escort box that we are all used to it's sleek and nice to look at, hugs the roads and has a smooth ride.

I don't recommend someone who is 6'2 buying  this car but at 5'5&quot; it's comfortable, low cost and a great way to rebuild your credit if that is what you need at Less than 12K you can't get a better deal.<br><br>
