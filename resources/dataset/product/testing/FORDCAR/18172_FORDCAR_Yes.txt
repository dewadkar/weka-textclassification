            Its 6 years after I bought my alpine green 1996 Probe SE and one day after I sold it. I decided to write this for anyone seeking a used car. What can I say about this car to give it the credit it deserves but never got. 135,000 miles later I finally had to breakdown and give it up. This car did anything I pushed it to do. I ran it hard and fast and it kept up the whole way. Of course I did run into more problems than I expected, but they were usually small. I chose the smaller engine with the standard transmission. To this day the car still has amazing power. The clutch was replaced at around 75k. Major problem however is the airconditioning. It has gone out every summer since Ive had it including 2 weeks after it was purchased. And in TX you do not go without AC, hence the reason its gone now. cost more to fix than the car was worth this time. Oh and if you get a probe invest in a 2 liter bottle of coke because you'll need it. I found it was the easiest way to get the acid off of my battery and start the car. After numerous times of trying to have whatever the problem was repaired I just gave up and kept a bottle in the trunk at all times. the problem with the battery happened on a regular basis. 
anyway, if you are looking for a reliable used car for yourself or your kid or something, if you arent mechanically inclined i wouldnt recommend the probe for you. like i said there were quite a few SMALL problems but those do add up. but if you are capable of minor repairs go for it. this was the first car ive ever owned bought at age 18 and i will tell you i cried when the new owner drove it off. oh and they hold up remarkably well in accidents. it was hit by a fast moving truck from behind with minimal damage. So to anyone looking for a used probe. as long as it has a decent amount of miles go for it. its fun to drive and with proper care to the exterior the style still looks great.
