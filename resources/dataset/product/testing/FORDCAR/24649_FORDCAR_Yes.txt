            This is a well-designed, roomy van and I love it.  It is a pleasure to drive.  It holds 7 passengers comfortably and with the rear seats out can hold an amazing amount of items.  It is probably the most versatile vehicle that I have ever owned.  The motor (3.0) runs perfectly and my mileage is 22 - 25 on the highway and 18 - 20 in town.  The interior is well laid out and has quality carpeting and upholstery.  The captain seats are very comfortable and the Aerostar is a good cruiser on long trips.  I do wish that the passenger seat moved back and forth and was not stationary.  Everything works on this van even after 150 K of miles.  I am impressed!  (front and back wipers, windshield washer front and back, cruise control, heater, a.c., radio, power windows, interior lights, etc.)  It has a solid "truck-type" body and is well built with very few rattles.  I previously had a Ford Econoline van and it was loose, noisy, not economical, bulky, and hard to drive and park.  My Aerostar is tight, quiet, has good mileage, and is a dream to drive and park.  I also like the looks of the Aerostar.  With the sloped front windshield and the neat, boxy exterior, it suits my needs perfectly.
I have had only a few problems with my Aerostar.  I replaced the water pump at 152,000 miles.  The front power windows have been a problem, but it has been the cheap plastic buttons that operate the windows and not the window motors.  These buttons crack easily.  Also the window channel gaskets need to be lubricated with silicon regularly in order that the windows will slide up and down easily.  I have had some rust problems in the rocker panel areas just below the front doors and on the driver's side down in the lower areas beneath the gas filler lid.  The original paint job is not the best and I will need to repaint this vehicle in the near future.  I have replaced brake pads periodically on the front disk brakes, but I see this as routine maintenance.
  I am a professional person and I drive my clients around with pride in this vehicle; yet on weekends I can easily haul 4' by 8' sheets of plywood in my Aerostar.  After driving this vehicle for some time, I have regained my faith in Ford products.  Thank you Uncle Henry for producing a fine vehicle.
