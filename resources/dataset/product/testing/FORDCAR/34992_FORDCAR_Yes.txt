            The first generation Probe was the first successful meeting of Ford stylists and Mazda engineers. Based on the 626 platform, the Probe's Mazda twin was called the MX-6.

I drove my Probe LX from new to 140K with no major problems to speak of. The experience I had lead me to a second generation Probe as well as a Ford Escape (Mazda-engineering again).

Engine:
1.8L 4-cylinder mated with a 5-speed stick. I had no problems in the city or on the highway - lots of pep. Gas mileage was super - once a week fill-up.

Handling:
Quite good though there was some front-wheel drive hop in wet weather or on hard acceleration.

Interior:
Nicely appointed 2+2 seating. Very smart front passenger seat design had a nice "fold-away" to let passengers get to the back seat. Back seat was tight for short adults. Also, the high center console made for impossible movement across one side to the other.  

Dashboard was unique - the entire instrument pod moved with the tilt of the steering wheel - at the time, only the Porsche 928 did the same thing. However, I had the LX which was fully loaded with a digital dash and a rear wiper. The digital dash wasn't informative since the numbers were always a millisecond off. The center console had a "weather" system so the digital display would also say things like "ice forming" "temp dropping".

Rear hatch had huge liftover and some of the plastic fixtures for the window cylinders cracked in the sun.

Quality:
I had no major problems with the Probe. Heater failed because of burnt-out fuse. Pop-up headlamps failed once - also because of a fuse.

Value:
A 1st gen Probe is now 11 years old. I'd recommend a used Probe as long as you've got service records and that the pop-up lamps are fine. The 4-cylinder engine is very reliable and the rest of the car is quite reliable as well. You could also get a V6 in a Probe but that's overkill.  Avoid the Probe GT as it was powered by a problem-prone turbocharged 4 cylinder engine.
