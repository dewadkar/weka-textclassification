            I have been driving a 5.0L 1991 Thunderbird since it was new.  It now has just shy of 200,000 and will still blow the doors off everything on the road except for a V8 Mustang, and it will even run with them.  It required no real maintenance until it had over 50,000 miles when the transmission needed overhaul.  The last year I've started having to replace worn out components, but maintenance is still much less than a payment on a new car.

Basic mechanical reliability has been good.  The starter is a weak point.  The Thunderbird was never designed for a V8, and when they crammed the 5 liter V8 in they had to install a tiny, exotic, and expensive high output miniature starter.  I am on my fourth one.  

You have to be careful with this car on wet or slippery roads.  You can very definitely lose it if you get ham footed.  An intelligent driver can get a lot of performance out of it, but this much power has to be managed wisely.  Don't try and teach your teenager to drive on a damp day in this car.  Trust me on this.

The paint and exterior plastic on my car is all pretty much trashed.  The Texas heat has fried the black paint and the black plastic on the bumpers is peeling off.  The interior is holding up pretty well, but I had to put locktite on several interior screws to keep them from backing out.

This car is for the long distance driver.  It is very happy to go 70mph all day long.  Unlike most foreign cars, big American V-8s develop most of their power at low rpms.  This means that the engine turns very slowly when the four speed automatic locks into overdrive, giving a very quiet and smooth ride.  At 70mph you have a huge reserve of power should you need to pass or manuever. 90mph is just seconds away if you ever need to go there.   It even gets decent mileage on the interstate.  Around town, it's best to own oil company stock.

The cruise control on this car is kind of lazy, it doesn't nail the speed well on hilly roads.  

The seats are comfortable and they have held up well, but they are not as good as on the imported luxury cars.  Why Detroit can't go the last mile for really world class seats has always been a mystery to me.  When it was new I almost installed Recarro seats, now I wish I had.

You can't argue reliability against 200,000 with no major breakdowns.  I'm holding out for a new car next fall, when I plan to send my TBird to honorable retirement after a decade of faithful service.  

I don't recommend these cars because they really don't make any logical sense.  A Tarus or Camray are more sensible.  But if you like it, you'll like it.  (This concept is covered in the Tao Chen.)  <br><br>
