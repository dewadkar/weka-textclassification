            The Ford Focus is awesome!!!!!!! I had seen this car a couple of weeks back and finally had the chance to see it first hand. I was not disappointed. Needing a new car for the new Millenium, I FocusED myself on the Ford Focus. I did some price comparison and visited several dealerships. All salesmen had nothing but praise for the vehicle. This sounded to good to be true. I test drove the Focus and they were right. Not only was the Focus a great looking car, it had a great ride. The room for the driver and passenger was more than comfortable. I being a little extravagant, opted for gold metallic Focus with cream leather seats.These seats are very comfortable. You have individual controls to adjust the driver seats higher or lower and also a control to adjust the support of the back for driving around town or for long trips. Being a avid listener of different types of music, i chose the cd player. The sound system in the Ford Focus was very well balanced. If you want bass.....you got bass. If you want to listen to some classic Chicago....play away!!! You can become enveloped in the music and cruise into the night with the great suspension of the Ford Focus. The Focus is very responsive. You do not have to worry about skipping cds....this car has great suspension system. The ride is very smooth. And to top off the suspension system I insisted on having the aluminum rims....This is one great looking car. if you like convenience, my car came with a nice little remote that allows me to open or lock my car with the push of a remote button. And for those who are very security conscious, Ford has incorporated a chip in the key that interacts with car to start it. Without the key, thieves get nowhere!!!! I highly recommend the Ford Focus for the single individual to a new starting family with the Ford Focus ZTS. The Ford Focus comes with the new clips to securely keep your little one in the car seats that are being manufactured to be very safe and secure. If you are a individual like myself who is very meticulous and conscious of your money...Do not fear purchasing this vehicle....You will not regret.I love the stares and ah's as I drive around town. In one word......AWESOME!!!!!!<br><br>
