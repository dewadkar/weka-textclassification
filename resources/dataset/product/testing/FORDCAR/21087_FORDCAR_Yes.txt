            My wife and I own a 99 WINDSTAR that we bought in Feb 99 and we have had no problems with it at all. WE HAD A 97 AND HAVE LEASED FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS FROM FOR WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS WITH 3 DIFFERENT VAN'S.  WHEN WE DID HAVE A PROBLEM FORD FIXED IT THE FIRST TIME IS WAS IN THE SHOP.  WE WOULD BUY ANOTHER ONE WHEN THIS LEASE IS UP. THE RIDE IS GREAT AND IS VERY COMFORTABLE. SHE REALLY LIKES TWO SIDE DOORS AND WITH A SET OF TWINS AND TWO OLDER KIDS ITS EASY TO GET IN AND OUT. WE HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL TRIPS AND HAS A LOT OF ROOM.<br><br>
