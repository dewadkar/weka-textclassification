            I bought this car in Sept. 1994 (the first car I purchased myself).  My biggest consideration in choosing a car was that it have plenty of power and preferably a V-8, which is getting harder to find.  Another consideration was a reasonable price.  Since I drive on the interstate each day to work, I enjoy having the power of a V-8 available.  I also wanted something with a sporty look and 2 doors.  I also considered purchasing a Mustang or Camaro.  However, both of these models were considered sports cars, which meant higher insurance rates.  The T-Bird is considered a Sedan (lower insurance rates).  Thus, I decided to purchase the T-Bird after a test drive.

As of December 9, 2001, I have thoroughly enjoyed both owning and driving this car.  The maintenance costs have been fairly low.  I currently have a little over 57,000 miles on the odometer.  During this time I've taken the car to the dealer for the 30,000 service and to the Texaco quik-lube for oil changes every 3,000 miles.  Apparently the oil filter is in a tight place (the quik-lube guys comment on this almost every time I bring my car in for an oil change).  That's why I let them to do the oil changes!  After Christmas I'm going to have the 60,000 mile service done just to check things out.  Other than this I've only had one other problem with the engine around the 30,000 service where there was a knocking sound coming from the engine when I accelerated.  The dealer said this was caused by a need for new spark plug wires.  I haven't had a problem since.

Overall, this is a great car with plenty of power and room.  I also have the climate control system which I find very useful and convenient.  You just have to set the temp you want inside and the system determines if you need heat or A/C.  A great car, too bad they're replacing it with the new model which costs much more. 

Update:  December 14, 2003

I currently have a little over 68,000 miles on the odometer and I haven't had to spend that much for repairs on the car.  In June 2003 I spent about $1,000.00 for car repairs which included new front brakes, front end alignment,new automatic transmission gaskets, oil change, and labor costs. I also had to purchase a set of tires around that time.  But other than that the maintenance costs have been pretty minimal since I purchased the car.  One other inherent weakness with a V-8 T-Bird is a tendency for the rear wheels to spin when you encounter slick surfaces.
