            I've been driving the 2001 Explorer Sport for 1 month. Very happy with the appearance, style and ride. I went with the Convenience, Cloth Comfort and Sport packages and standard CD player. Nice instrument panel layout easy to read white panel, except the rear window wiper and rear defrost controls are a little out of reach. 

Nice things:
&gt;I like the small compartment that houses the garage remote control, keeps it out of the way.
&gt;Plenty of cargo room with the rear seats down for transporting small items up to the size of a dishwasher or large fish tank with stand. 
&gt;Also a nice job on the cup holders, the main cup holder is huge, big enough for a super gulp with no chance of spilling.
&gt;Adding the Convenience group gets you the rear air ducts for AC and heat. With controls for fan speed and radio controls, a nice feature for a lower-mid priced car.

Not so nice:
&gt;Living in Florida the A/C must work very fast, it doesn't. Compared to my last vehicle ('97 Jimmy 4-door), it takes 45 seconds longer to get cool air. That may not sound like much to complain about, but when you step into a hot car sitting in the parking lot, 45 seconds seems an eternity.
&gt;Take off power not too great either. I've been told that after the first 3,000 miles that your power increases, I guess I'll find out in another month or two. Passing power is really bad, and considering the city gas mileage of about 16 MPG, you would think better engine performance.
&gt;Adding lumbar support in the seats would have been a nice touch, the seats need additional support in the back.
&gt;Getting in and out of the back is a nightmare. I still haven't figured out how exactly to easily get the passenger seat forward and then back into the original position without having to use two hands and a lot of oomph!

Over all I have to say that I liked my '97 4 door Jimmy more, the payments were less, for much more car; more amenities, more power and more doors. Oh well, I only have this for 35 more months...
