            A couple of months I bought a 1991 Ford Explorer XLT.  I have always wanted a SUV but could not afford a new one.  A good friend of mine, who owns a car lot in Kaufman, had a 1991 Ford Explorer for sale and I bought it.  I have not been sorry that I bought the SUV.  There is only my husband and I and the Ford Explorer is big enough for us.  It gets real good gas mileage.  I can get over 200 miles on a tank of gas and with the price of gas, that helps out quite a lot.  The back seat lets down and I can haul things in the back. The back door has a handle that will open the window or the door.  The Explorer, to me, handles well on the major highways or the back roads. All controls are at your fingertips.  The cruise control is easy to set.  There is nothing that I hate about the car. This is a good vehicle for a small family, or with couples who have no children.<br><br>
