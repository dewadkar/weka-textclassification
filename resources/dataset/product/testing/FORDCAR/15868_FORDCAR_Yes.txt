                       I decided to purchase this vehicle because i wanted a sport utility that had the most luggage space i could get for the buck as well as the looks.
           I did some delivery work and had owned a mini-van. it had the space but not the power or handling i needed for the Oregon weather. i started looking for a sport utility and it took about an hour or so to decide that the explorer was the way to go. The power was excellent and the drive was like a car. It has been my work vehicle and my personal vehicle. I put over 60,000 miles on it in one year and had very little repairs. When you are in the car for over 8 hours a day you want comfort and here you have it.
         I found that it has more than enough space to sleep in while camping, and i`m not a small person. I actually have a hard time saying anything i really dislike about this ride. It meets my expectations. And for all those tests saying it rolls over easier than others, they are way wrong. I drive this like car and i drive crazy. Never had a problem taking corners fast or flying on curvy roads. It holds 5 people comfortably. Plenty of leg room for the driver and everyone. Overall a good ride. <br><br>
