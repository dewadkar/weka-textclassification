            I really wanted a Jeep, but my wife and the 0.9%APR really talked me out of it, and I am really happy that it happened.  My wife had a RAV4, previous to our marriage, and I fit in that thing like a polar bear in the sahara.  I was tight, cramped and I hated that thing with a passion.

The Explorer XLT Package was a real good fit.  My wife and I are both over 5'10, and we each fit comfortably, even in the back seat.  And, I never get in the back seat.  

The Explorer is great handling vehicle it really turns on a dime.  I have even have had Dodge guys tell me that my Ford turns in about half the distance of their trucks.  It has great power, I tow a jetski about 5 months of the year and this truck does not even think twice about it.  The funny thing is, my buddies with their jimmy's have to wait for the boat ramp to open up, but not me, I drive down on the beach, back it in the water, strap up the ski and we are gone.  Though, the only ting I dislike is the fact that I need to open up the back hatch to see my trailer because of the blind spots while backing it up.  

This is a fairly smooth ride, with some ground noise.  Also, it handles very well at higher highway speeds.  It does like to drink gas, but we seem not to notice too much, it mostly is a rec vehicle that we just mostly drive around town and to church.  

I would recommend to anyone from the city dweller to weekend warrior and anyone in between.  Have fun and drive safe<br><br>
