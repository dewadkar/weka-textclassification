            In 1997 I leased a '97 Ford F-150, XLT 4X4 truck.  This was my first ever four wheel drive truck.  It was a standard cab, AT, 4.6 intimidator. I added dual exhaust, and oversized agressive tires.  I called it the intimidator because of the off road ability.  I took on the river bottoms of the Red River in Grand Forks, MN.  Others would try to out the abilities of their Chevs, and Rams against my Ford.  Hands down was the results to every challenge.  Although their comments were brief, they couldnt believe that my F-150 took on and completed each run on this muddy, sloppy river bottom.  The other four wheelers either didn't take the challenge or had to be pulled out!!

I now own a '99 Ford F-150, 4X4 OffRoad flare side, AT, 4.6 in dark tudor red.  Again with dual exhaust and 4&quot; cannon ends.  With the larger engine, the duals sound great!!  I have dressed it up with vinal flames that come alive in different lighting. I also sent away for blue Zeon halogen headlights, that not only personalize the truck but make nite visibility,(especially in rain) a pleasure for driving.

My truck is my toy, but it also is a workhorse.  Due to a storm, I helped a friend clean up from fallen trees.  I hooked a tow rope to trees and pulled 4&quot; diameter trees out at the roots.  

I usually trade trucks every two years or so, but Im gonna hang on to this one till it drops.  The towing ability is outstanding.  You can hardly notice you have a trailer attached.  The ride is extreemly comfortable with cloth 60/40 seat.  Just hit the cruise, and enjoy the ride for miles.  The steering and handeling amazed me while doing 85mph,when I was forsed off a  freeway by a inattentive driver.  While I was in the left lane, I was forsed to drive into the grass between north/south bound traffic.  I held tight to the steering wheel, and slowly touched the brakes.  After slowing down considerable, I was able to steer back onto the freeway.  After the shock, I was amazed because the truck responded to my commands.  It was almost like driving on a cloud.

Needless to say, I love my Ford F-150 and I encourage anyone, in question of what to purchace, to give the others a drive and compare.  However purchace a Ford F series truck........<br><br>
