            PROS :

1) Great comfort.  All kinds of interior will work, the seats are wonderful and don't hurt your back.

2) Gorgeous looks.  The SN95 Mustangs are pretty much all great-looking.  They're sporty but kinda classy as well.

3) Fast.  If you know what you're doing you can make a Mustang a great racecar.  

4) Good price.  This is a great car for a price that isn't expensive at all.  For a 1994 some might think it is, but even the newer ones like 2000 and 2001 are around 25000 if you don't get one that's really supercharged.

5) Handles great.  They're easy to steer, accelerate fast, take corners well, and are fun to drive.

6) Smooth ride.  Not many bumps unless it's on the road and is very peaceful.

CONS :

1) Insurance on these cars is pretty high.  If you're lucky you could get it about 100/month but I pay 150 because of who drives it.

2) Low to the ground.

3) There isn't much room in the backseat so it's not a great family car.  But it isn't awful, two people can fit back there all right.
