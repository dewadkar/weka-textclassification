            I purchased one of the first SVTs manufactured. This car is quick, handles great, and is always fun to drive. I can take this car on the interstate and push 100 MPH for as long as I like (although I don't really recommend this behavior to the general public). Highway on and off ramps are its finest strength. When you can corner fast enough to hit the acceleration lane faster than the highway traffic, you know you have a winner. The brakes are huge and can stop this car as fast as you can accelerate it. You can autocross this car right off the showroom floor.

My only knock on the car is the reliability. I will list all problems (get some coffee!): rear brake pad not homogeneous and gouged rotor (warranty fix), front brake disc warped because service tech overtorqued lugs (warranty fix), water pump went @ 60K (non-warranty fix), third gear synchros wasted (warranty fix - replaced with new trans), second and third gear synchros wasted on new trans (non-warranty fix, $1600!!!), fuel filler check valve warped due to improper material selection (warranty fix, actually &quot;secret recall&quot; aka Technical Service Bulletin), bulb went on interior clock - I actually have one of those - the new ones don't (warranty fix - the bulb is soldered in so you can't just drop a new one in), emissions sensors went - one at 40K - one at 50K (non-warranty fix, about $200 each).

I am an engineer and used to work for Ford Motor Company, so I guess I got what I expected out of a first-off. At first I thought I was to blame for the trans, but I started to take it easy after the first one went back to Dearborn and it happened again, only worse. Maybe there is too much power for the trans? 

One piece of advice if you live in a cold weather state. Buy a set of snow tires. The stock tires (Eagle GS-C or F1, depending on vintage) are no better than getting there on foot.

Ford insists on putting the button only radio in cars. I hate that thing.

The seats are mighty comfortable for the front pasengers. I have a friend who is a automotive seating design engineer (Plymouth Prowler), and he gave them a thumbs up. The back is cramped for anyone over the age of 12.<br><br>
