            I purchased a '99 Explorer Sport in June of '99 and just love it. I previously had a '93 Sport and found it to be a very comfortable and durable vehicle and wanted to continue with a new one. I test drove the others so i could make an informed decision before i plunked down $28,000 on a new vehicle.
 I found the Nissan Pathfinder to be an unattractive vehicle with a thin and cheap feeling interior to match. The Isuzu Rodeo was better looking but with the same cheap looking interior and a poor control layout for the instrumentation yet they did have a good rebate program at the time. 
 The Toyota 4-runner was a nice vehicle but seemed narrow in comparison with the Explorer. The Chevy Blazer was very cheap looking when compared to all of the other vehicles yet it rode more like a car than the rest. I preferred the ride and overall value for my money thus purchased the Ford.
 It has in the past proved to be a very durable vehicle in the past and the new one has proven the same thus far. It is a vehicle for someone without little kids and carseats yet they would be very comfortable with a 4-door Explorer. The climate control has been great with plenty of cold air in summer and warm in winter. The leather seats comfortable but cold to initially sit on in winter. The premium sound system with rear controls and cd player continue to deliver superior sound that Fords have been known for. Go buy one and never fear bad weather or road conditions again.<br><br>
