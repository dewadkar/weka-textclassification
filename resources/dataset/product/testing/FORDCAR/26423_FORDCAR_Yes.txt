            Ford Winstars are the coolest minivans on the market, well i guess as cool as you can get for a minivan.  All of a sudden all of the other minivans look alot like the windstars, way to go to set the trend.  Fords minivan the windstar is about loaded with all the options that you can think about.  The come well equipped with a great safety package, actually the best one out.  They have pretty good power, and run rather well.  My Mom has one and its got alot of miles on it now and it still runs nicely, the only bad thing is the transmission, our driveway is slanted upward and when you put it in reverse to go down the driveway it pops into gear instead of just going into it.  That is my only complaint well that and they hub caps were so good that someone stole them from us but oh well, we can get more.<br><br>
