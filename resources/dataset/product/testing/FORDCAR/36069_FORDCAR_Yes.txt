            My previous car was a V8 Mercury Cougar, so I was looking for something smaller with good gas mileage around town.  My Ford Focus ZX3 Hatchback reminded me how much fun a practical car could be.

I love how it handles on winding roads or in city traffic. The ride is excellent for a car this size, due to the suspension and long wheelbase. The small size is just right for me.  I appreciate having leg room equal to that found in a mid-size car. The upright seating position and great visibility are pluses. Fit and finish are excellent on my car, an autumn orange with light grey interior.  Squeaks are minimal, but I've only had it for 3months, so time will tell.  I got the anti-lock brakes and stops are smooth and straight.  The standard CD player sounds better than the premium sound system I had in my Cougar.  Gas mileage is good for city driving.  No power windows were available, but for me, I like to be able to crank down the windows before I get into a hot car.   

I have to remember that this is an economy car.  So the engine, while adequate, is not meant for racing with the automatic transmission, and I realized that with the 5-speed it would be quicker.  However for city driving, with tons of stop lights, the automatic is a better choice.  Ford did some cost-cutting with quality of materials: sound proofing in back, sun visors are small and cheap, carpeting is thin, to name the most obvious.  But for the price, I knew I couldn't have everything.  One thing that I make a conscious effort to do: watch the door locks.  I noticed when I brought my car in for service, the first thing the technician did was to check the door locks before he shut the door.  The doors lock automatically at about 4 mph, so just make sure you unlock them if you step out, or lower the window a bit to avoid a lockout. It's really easy to do.

This car would be great for a small family, someone on a budget, or someone who just likes the idea of driving a fun car, with unique styling. There aren't that many on the road yet, and they do attract attention.

Update:  After 4000 miles, I still find the ZX3 fun to drive.  The car is great in both city and highway driving.  No squeaks or rattles, although the stereo is often up at full volume:)  One oil and filter change so far, plus a recall for a fuel injection part... that was taken care of in a few hours.  To sum up, it's been a great little car. Comfortable and fun.

Any negatives to add?  Not really. Just be aware that it has only a 4 cyl engine.  Even with the 130 horses, it can keep up with highway traffic, but it isn't fast from the start.  But I came from a V8, so the 4 cyl z-tech is fine if you know its limits.  The 5 spd would be more responsive than my auto trans., but the auto is a smooth shifter and great in stop and go, rush hour traffic.
