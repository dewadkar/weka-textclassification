            If internet cookies are as evil as some believe, I just put a marketing doofus at Ford the Motor Company into Betty Ford the Clinic. When they try to connect the dots on a Crown Victoria page hit with Sex Pistol and Black Flag downloads from Napster, someone's going to reach for the bottle.

Let's get the obvious out of the way first: The Crown Vic is the poster car for the AARP and the Fraternal Order of Police. Find a retirement community or a Dunkin Donuts and there ye shall find big Ford sedans. This car is so Republican it makes your teeth hurt. Now for the less obvious: The boring Crown Vic buyers are on to something. Dollar-for-dollar this is one of the best large sedans in the world.

For being a geezermobile the Crown Vic has handling manners that are nothing less than astonishing. The steering is taunt and responsive, transmitting ample feel from the front tires and with good weighting to make placing the car where you want it much easier than the GM entries. Thrown into a corner the Crown Vic will list, notably more than a European sedan, but given it's image the body roll is a probably a lot less than you expect. The same applies to the ride. It's not as taunt as a Mercedes E-class or BMW 5 series but the Vic only feels like it's lacking poise when the nose dives under hard braking. It's not excessive but it does clash with the character of the handling everywhere else.  

The engine is a marvel. The Crown Vic was the first recipient of Ford's overhead cam Triton motor. I worked at a Ford dealership the year it debuted and the new motor transformed the car. The 4.6 liter engine is simply delightful, smooth and quick to rev with it's 215 horsepower spread across a wide powerband. The four speed automatic shifts smoothly and decisively, adding to the teutonic feel. Braking is adequate for a 3000 pound-plus sedan, but like the nose dive this is one area where you won't wonder if someone forgot to put the three-point star on the grill.

Wind and road noise are almost totally muted at freeway speeds and beyond. The cabin of the Crown Vic is one of the more pleasant places to pile on the miles. The instrument panel layout is as good as any car in it's class, with legible gauges that can be read at a glance and excellent ergonomics. The seats are big enough to make an NFL lineman feel at home but have firmer padding than Detroit iron of old. And while the clean exterior lines don't draw excessive attention to it's size on the outside, the cabin never lets you forget that this is a <i>big</i> car. You can pack four real adults on board and know that they will still be on speaking terms at the end of the day. What's good for Grampa also works for hauling your friends to a Phish concert three states away-or for hauling the kids around if the minivan and SUV craze has left you looking for something different. 

I also can't think of a better vehicle for getting from A to B in a hurry. No, the Crown Vic won't outrun a Ferrari, but it can move at extra legal speeds with almost total invisibility. What do you think when you see a Crown Vic coming up fast in your mirrors? Cop, right? What do you think a cop thinks? Plant a half-dozen antennas on the trunklid like some Crown Vic buyers do and you may never get pulled over again-heh heh.

For the less anti-social type, the Crown Victoria offers an impressive package of space, comfort, safety and performance at a bargain price-less than $28,000 fully equipped. It's only drawback is that it won't make a statement about who you are. But if you need that kind of thing, I personally recommend cruising past the retirement communities and donut shops with Black Flag's &quot;Slide It In&quot; turned up on the stereo. Just don't tell the marketing people at Ford.
