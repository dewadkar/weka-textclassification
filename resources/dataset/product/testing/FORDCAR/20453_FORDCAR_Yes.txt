            Our family bought this vehicle for the family. We had a ranger that was getting a little to crammed.  The overall satisfaction with the Ford F250 super duty crew cab is good.  The only thing is the size makes it hard to find parking and the amount of gas the truck uses.  The gas mileage is not so great.  Driving this vehicle makes you feel as thought you are king of the road.  People looking for a vehicle that will go just about anywhere and need the extra comfort of the crew cab this is the truck to look into.  People looking for a economical vehicle should look into a smaller truck with better gas mileage<br><br>
