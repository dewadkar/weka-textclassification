            After spending most of my driving life couped up in a (now deceased) Nissan Z car, it was time to buy a new car.  I was a sports car kinda guy, but I needed something a little more practical... something that fit my lifestyle which seemed to involve moving every 6 months... as well as a lot of outdoor activities.  I didn't want to cave in to the SUV craze and a station wagon was completely out of the question.  So I decided that perhaps I should stick to the sports cars, and headed down to the Ford dealership to look at the Mustang.

I first saw the 1999 Ranger XLT as I was walking across the lot to the showroom.  It had a very sport aggressive look that seems missing from most compact pickups.  On a whim, I decided to take it for a test drive... I wasn't seriously thinking about buying it, after all pickups were for cowboys and construction workers.  Needless to say, 2 hours and $16,000 later I was driving it home.

I love my Ranger for its versatility.  You can pile a bunch of wood in the back and drive through the mud, and then hose it off and take your date to the opera that night.  With the 3.0 litre V6 and 5 speed manual transmission, it has all the pep of a sports car....and handles nicely too.  Get bucket seats, power windows and a CD player, and the Ranger has a luxurious feel inside while effortlessly plowing through the harshest climates outside.

My Ranger continues to be rugged and reliable, and I still love to look at it sitting in my driveway after its been washed.  My only real complaint is that the regular cab does not give much room for stuff.  The seats are roomy and comfortable, but if you have a backpack or briefcase and somebody in your passenger seat, you have to throw it in the back. If I could do it again, I would have gotten the supercab.  

This truck is great for a single guy who wants a fun, stylish and powerful pickup to throw a tent and a mountainbike in the back and go play in the mud.<br><br>
