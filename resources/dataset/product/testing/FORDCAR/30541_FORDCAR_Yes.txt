            We purchased our 1992 Escort when it was brand new.  We wanted a car that got good gas mileage and could also hold a family as we were newly married.  To this day we have NO regrets!

My husband drove the Escort back and forth to college (60 miles round-trip) for 4 years and still drives it back and forth to work today (60 miles round-trip).  It still runs great and we are still able to use it with our family of four.

We have a 5 speed manual transmission and other than a squeak here and there, it has the smoothest and quietest ride I have ever had in a car.  We have purchased new tires, but have not had any major problems since we purchased the car.

We would highly recommend this car to people that are looking for a good car for a good price.  <br><br>
