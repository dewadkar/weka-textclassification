            The only complaint is the paint job. It started going away when the car was 4 years old. I went to Ford and other body shops and they all said it was just that paint, nothing I could do about it. Ford knew it was a POS job, but they weren't willing to do anything about it, like they did the Taurus'.

As for the oil leaks, they're normal, I'll get them fixed when I do the clutch.  The wind noise is a drawback when you have company in the car,  then it's a strain to talk over, especially on longer trips. But if you use it as a commuter car, where you're mainly alone anyway, the radio drowns all that out.

Other than that, this car has been good to me, it is very reliable in any situation, and it keeps me safe.

I will definationly buy a new one some day.<br><br>
