            I do not personally own a Ford Explorer, but my Mom and Dad have had 2 of them and My sister currently owns one.

I think this is a strong, good, dependable vehicle and has a sporty look to it as well.

The inside of these Explorers are very roomy and have a lot of options as well.  Most of them come equipped with air conditioning, 6 disk cd players, and cruise control.

The 4x4 models are great for winter time driving, and make it a breeze to get though the snow.  The 4x4 feature gives you a added peace of mind when driving in the snow.

We have pulled our boat with My parents when they had theirs, and my sister currently pulls a 21 foot Rinker boat with hers.  You wouldn't want to go any bigger than a 21 foot boat with one to save wear and tear on the vehicles drivetrain and engine.  However, it does pull up to a 21 foot boat fantastic.

The Explorers offer a great and comfortable ride, and very quiet inside.

The Explorers are very nice handling vehicles and are comfortable to drive short and long distance.

If you are looking for a SUV, I highly recommend looking at the Ford Explorers.<br><br>
