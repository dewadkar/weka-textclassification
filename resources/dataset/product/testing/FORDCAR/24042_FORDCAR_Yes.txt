            I have been very pleased with my 1997 Ford Expedition.  It has a smooth ride for a sport utility vehicle and believe it or not, the inside stays nice and cozy during the winter.  This is a huge step forward from the Jeep that I was driving prior to its purchase.  It offers plenty of legroom and storage space and cuts into parking spaces like a dream.  Very easy to drive regardless of its size.  Perfect for the carpooling mother.
I do not recommend this vehicle to someone who is on a tight gas budget.  Mine only averages about 13.6 miles per gallon and most of my driving is highway miles.
Overall I would say that I am very pleased with this vehicle.<br><br>
