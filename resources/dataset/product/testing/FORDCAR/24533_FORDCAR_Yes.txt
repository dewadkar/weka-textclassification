            We bought the 1997 Ford F150 V-8 Extended Cab with Tow package for the purpose of pulling a two horse trailer, hauling hay, and driving around our dirt &amp; gravel property. This should not be too much to ask of a vehicle supposedly designed for this purpose. Unfortunately, it was. 

For example, we hauled a load of hay out to our barn in the winter and ended up stuck in the mud. To Ford's credit, their roadside assistance program covered this and they sent a tow truck out to &quot;unstick&quot; us, which the tow truck driver did - after he stopped laughing that is. Our truck was not a 4-wheel drive but then again the mud involved should not have required a 4-wheel drive to drive through.

The truck hauled our two-horse trailer nicely but was a bit sluggish uphill. After our mud incident I did not trust it on anything but paved roads so that really limited my use since I do a lot of trail riding and horse camping and need to be able to haul on gravel and dirt roads. On the other hand, someone who only hauls to large shows, on paved roads might like this truck for its good looks and the ability to customize your trailer to match the truck.

As a daily driver I loved this truck. (Although do you really want a daily driver that gets only 12 to 15 mpg?)It handles like a car and with the captains chairs was very comfortable to ride in for long periods of time. The back seat is rather small for adults but our young children were fine and the third door made installing carseats a breeze. The other nice thing was that the passenger front airbag had an on/off switch so that children could ride up front when necessary.

The bed was nice, carried everything we wanted no problem. Also, the tailgate locks which helps prevent theft. Our truck was a bit pricey at $25,000.00 especially since it didn't do the job we bought it for but if you want a truck just to say you have a truck this is perfect. For real work I would recommend either moving up into the F-250+ or trying a different make altogether. <br><br>
