<TEXT>
            I purchased my 1997 Explorer new and have not had any problems so far. I have 40,000 miles on it. I used to have a Bronco 2, but the quality of the Explorer far exceeds it. The gas guage had a recall about 2 years ago, but that was fixed without a problem. The Firestone recall applies here, but you get 4 new tires at no cost to you. Not a bad deal. The Explorer is built solid, thus the gas milage is not the greatest. The back seats fold down for extra storage space, and if you have 3 people, you can just fold down half of the back seat. I have the optional CD player which works great, and now I don't know how I did without it.<br><br>
