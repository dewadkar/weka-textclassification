            If you like a car with a European feel, this is a very nice vehicle.  The ride is a little firm, but the handling on twisty roads is superb - I hit 50 consistently on Topanga Canyon driving into work this morning, and that's at least 10-15 mph faster than I would get on the Taurus/Sable. [Topanga Canyon is an extremely twisty road which is a major handling challenge for any car].

The main complaint I have is the buzzy engine.  It seems to deliver when pushed, but is horribly noisy and feels less than confidence-inspiring.

The seats are comfortable, but the cabin has a very compressed, initimate feeling that you might or might not like.  Going from a Mercury Sable rental to a Contour, I found that I missed the extra room and the smoother 6-cylinder engine, but preferred the handling and general &quot;feel&quot; by a significant margin.

Don't dismiss this car just because it's a buzzy four; I found that it grew on me as I continued to drive it.  The handling makes it an alert and almost happy companion.  I think the same car with a six would be a pretty good driver's car.

As you probably know by checking some of the other epinions, this car is basically the same as the Ford Mondeo in Europe.  As far as I can tell, this was Ford's first truly successful &quot;world car&quot; - one that was essentially the same in all markets.

If radio performance is important to you, this is one of the few rental cars that I'd recommend.  It pulls in even the weakest stations.  On the  Taurus/Sable, I couldn't get the public jazz station 88.1 at all; in the Countour it came in loud and clear.  Sound quality was merely OK, though - but the Sable was no better.

On the whole, I'd rent one again -- but I'd really like to try a 6-cylinder model.  Definitely a better driving experience than competing vehicles such as the Nissan Altima (so boring I forgot everything about it but the CD player after I left it).
