            I purchased the Ford Explorer Sport Trac because it was very different looking from any truck or SUV I've ever seen. Very sporty looking.

I really like the four doors and the short bed as I don't use the vehicle for hauling.

I have had the vehicle for 30 days and the wife, dog and I have made several short trips with luggage. The ride has been smooth, quiet and pleasantly comfortable. Lots of head turning.

I think ford has a winner and here are some suggestions that will only improve the chances to sell more.

  1- Find a CD changer manufacturer that has the shuffle feature for the CD's. My version only allows shuffling on the CD that is playing. I like to shuffle the CD's.

  2- Redesign the power seats and perhaps the manual seat to allow the seat to slide back about 4 more inches. Doesn't quite go back far enough for me and I'm 5'11&quot;.

  3- Allow passenger seat to recline another 15 degrees.

  4- Put some space between the lumbar control and the door. Not enough room to turn the lumbar control with the door closed.

  5- Move the power port from the passenger side of the console to the top of the console just below the storage lid. Difficult to reach from the drivers side.<br><br>
