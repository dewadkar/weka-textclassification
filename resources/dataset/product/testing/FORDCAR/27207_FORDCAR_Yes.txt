            For the past 20 years almost, I've owned nothing but economy cars (I started out with a 1984 K-car and worked my way up to a 1997 Toyota Tercel).  So I know what I'm talking about when it comes to compacts.

I don't actually own a Ford Focus, but I did have use of one for a week (and I drove it extensively during that week).  Therefore I can't comment on reliability or durability, but I can still tell you that I was very impressed with the Focus.  

When it was first introduced, I thought it was an UGLY car.  I still think the 2-door model and the station wagon are ugly, but the 2001 4-door (which is the type I drove) has a sleek look about it and is not visually offensive.

The interior is also impressive with smooth lines and well laid out dashboard.  The car I used was fully loaded with power everything so I don't know what options come standard, but I really liked the power seat height adjustment feature.  I'm average height so it isn't a huge deal to me, but I certainly could see how somebody who is either taller than average or shorter than average would really appreciate this feature.  Another feature that was great was the self-adjusting stereo volume.  The volume would automatically adjust itself in proportion to the speed you were traveling, so you never had a problem hearing it over the engine noise or continually adjusting it yourself every time you came to a stop or picked up speed.  It's a little thing but it's nice to have.      

What I was most impressed with overall was the feel of the car - I didn't feel like I was driving an economy car.  It was surprisingly roomy inside with plenty of head room and leg room, and there was enough space between the driver's seat and the passenger seat so that you didn't feel like you were pressed up right next to somebody.  The back seat comfortably sat an adult (behind the passenger with the seat pulled forward about halfway).  If the seat was all the way back, then the rear adult passenger would have felt a little cramped.  But still plenty of room for kids if you're looking for a family car.  The trunk was very spacious - I fit a set of golf clubs, a golf cart, and luggage for two people in the trunk with no problem.  

One thing that most economy cars have that the Ford Focus didn't was that "tin can" effect.  All of the vehicles that I've ever owned (with the exception of my Tercel), sound like a tin can when you close the door or drive over a bumpy road (and you felt like you were in a tin can when on a bumpy or gravel road).  The Focus sounds and feels very solid, even on the bumpiest of roads.

The gas mileage was great due to the 4 cylinder engine, but of course the sacrifice for that is power.  Mind you, considering the size of the engine, it could have been worse.  I wasn't able to pick up speed in a flash, but I had no problems passing - even on an incline.  

The only real complaint I have about the Focus is the cruise control.  When traveling on a flat highway, it works fine.  But as soon as you come across even the smallest hills or valleys, your speed starts to go all over the place.  I found myself not even using the cruise control most of the time because of this.  

Other than that, I think this is an all around great car.  I'm going to be getting a new car in the next couple of months, and the Focus is definitely on my short list.
