            The Mustang -- the original pony car -- is all-new for 1999 with improvements to every single system under its brand-new skin. 

The Mustang has only two true competitors, the Chevrolet Camaro and the Pontiac Firebird. Like the two GM pony cars, the Ford Mustang comes in many guises. There are V6 and V8 versions in both coupe and convertible body styles along with the Cobra, the super-performance model that competes against the Camaro SS and the Firebird Ram Air. There are Japanese and Korean coupes that compete with Mustang on price, but they don't offer pony car performance.

The Camaro and Firebird are slightly more powerful than the Mustang GT (by 45-70 horsepower). But the new Mustang GT is quieter, rides better, and offers better interior ergonomics and quality than the Camaro and Firebird. The Mustang GT is also less expensive than either of the GM pony cars by several thousand dollars. Those advantages make the Mustang GT the best all-around car in its class.
