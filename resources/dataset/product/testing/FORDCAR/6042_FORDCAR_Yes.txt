            If you find some of General Motors' "land yachts" appealing but don't want to part with the change for them and you're considering a "luxury vehicle"...you are near the end of your search if you're thinking <b>Crown Victoria.<b>
I purchased an LX in 1995 and wondered then what more could they add in the way of options!  The 95 I drove had 15" wheels but the 98 I went for has the 16" equipped and I could definitely notice a difference.
The Crown Victoria <b>WILL<b> seat 6 grown adults comfortably but I think somebody must have had the idea of 2 sets of couples taking an interstate drive in mind when this car was developed.  
I honestly have not looked into towing capabilities of this car but feel certain even the basic engine could handle whatever is latched to it.
Besides the fact that this model has a distinctive, classy look to it, this car seems to have a well-engineered background.  Law enforcement agencies have been using Crown Victoria for what appears to me as a record number of years.
If that were my main comparison, then let it be.
I don't know if the "Interceptor" model is available for the public but I <b>WISH<b> it were!
I'm satisfied with what general production is offering and would like to see an unbiased comparison with some of Mercedes Benz's offerings...really.  I personally think the Crown Victoria could win over MB enthusiasts hands down.
If you have the time, test drive one and don't be hesitant to pin the accelerator, (safely) to the floor.  The car is <b>BIG<b> but it has power to spare.  It does NOT have an "all over the road" feel to it.
It's a good, safe, solidly built machine.
Pssst, when I was young and dumb, I didn't even like Ford, but that was a carry-over from a "Ford, breakfast of Chevys" T-shirt.
This has been my opinion...thanks for reading.
