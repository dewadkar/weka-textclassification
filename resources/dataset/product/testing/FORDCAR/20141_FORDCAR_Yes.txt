            We absolutely love this van!  Ours is a 2000 Windstar SE that we purchased in November of 99.  Part of the reason we love it so much, is the fact that Ford has provided us with excellent customer service.  But, aside from that, here are a few more reasons...

1.  There is so much room!  Compared to a sedan, it feels like a bus roomwise.

2.  It is very comfortable.  Ours has leather seats, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  The lumbar support on the drivers and passengers seat is an added bonus.

3.  For being a &quot;family vehicle&quot; it is very sporty.  I'm a young mom, and so to give up the &quot;coolness&quot; of a car was hard for me until I found this van.  It is definitely very classy looking with the chrome trim that was available on our model.

4.  The sound system is incredible for being stock.

5.  Having the automatic sliding doors is something I would never give up now.  Being able to click the remote and have the door open by the time I get to the van is great for when you have your hands full, or on a rainy day.

7.  I love the grocery bag holders in the back!!!

8.  Knowing that it is five star rated for safety makes me feel very, well...safe!  And, I also like knowing that moms have designed this with other moms in mind.

I don't think there is anything I don't like about this van.  I think the only downfall to having a van is the gas mileage.  But this van is no worse thank others, so I can't say that that is something I dislike.

This van is great to drive.  You don't feel like you are driving a monster.  You actually like you're in a car, just higher up!  It corners nicely, and can really &quot;get up and go&quot; when you need it to.  The ride overall is very smooth, and better than a car.

I think anyone with children should invest in a minivan.  They are the ultimate family vehicle!!!<br><br>
