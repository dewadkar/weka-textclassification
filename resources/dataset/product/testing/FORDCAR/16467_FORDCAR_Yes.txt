            This is my fifth Ranger.  Although it is a 1996, it still looks as new as a 2000 model.  Absolutely dependable, quite comfortable and roomy even for someone as large as myself at 240 lbs and 6'6&quot;.  My previous Ranger, a 1995 was probably the best vehicle I have ever owned and I've owned 46 cars and trucks in my lifetime.  This one I found at a local new car/truck dealer and when I drove it couldn't tell it from a new one.  

After nearly three months and 4,000 miles, it hasn't disappointed.  It starts, stops, handles, looks great.  Although it doesn't have the comfort of a Lexus (what pickup does?) it is quite comfortable even for long trips (have taken several).  Fuel mileage is quite respectable at about 18 overall.

When comparing the Ranger to its competition, it should be obvious to anyone with a discerning eye that there is no competition.  The Ranger is the gold standard for comparing any other like vehicle.  So long as I buy pickups I will need only stop at the local Ford dealer to find what I want and need.  Absolutely recommended without hesitation.  <br><br>
