            About 9 months ago, I purchased a 1997 Ford Taurus. This car looked as good as it did new. It is very clean, inside and out. I could tell that it had been taken very good care of. 
The main reason I was looking at a Taurus is because of all the good things I have heard about how safe they are. I have driven and owned so many different cars in my life, but I have never driven one quite like this one.
There is no lack of power. In fact, I am very impressed with the mechanical performance. The steering is excellent in every weather condition I have faced with this car.
You'll always get a comfortable ride, whether you are going 20 mph or 75 mph. Most of the time, I get 25 miles per gallon. I do city and highway driving, so I just figure my mileage by the tankful.
I haven't had any problems with this car. It looks good, drives good, and is affordable to drive. There is very little noise while driving. 
I have taken my Taurus on several road trips , and I have always been impressed with the overall performance of this car. It seats 4 adults very comfortably and has plenty of trunk space. 
I sure didn't go wrong by getting this car!<br><br>
