            I have a 1996 Ford Taurus.  This car is so reliable and safe it is surprising that how much abuse this car takes. This car collided with a deer. Damage was minimal to the car. In fact I did not think any thing happened to it after I hit it. The deer was killed and tossed a good 20 feet into the ditch. I looked at the car only one of the light covers was busted and a slight distortion to the fender and hood �Hardly noticeable�.

This instance is the only time it really saw a repair shop except for general maintenance. 
This car also is pretty peppy for the price. Excellent passing ability for speed and handling. 
Winter driving handles well on black ice and even was able to drive through quite well..

Described in two words: Safe and reliable
