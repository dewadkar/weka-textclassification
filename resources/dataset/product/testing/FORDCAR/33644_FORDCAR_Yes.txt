            After having had a wide variety of automobiles, I have finally found a car that is an excellent value for the money.  I have got to say that my Ford Escort 4 door Sedan is Great!  

My major reason for purchasing this car was the great price.  I bought this fully loaded with Air, Power windows, door locks, alarm, ABS, nice factory model stereo.  

I like the sleek way it looks and it handles very well on the road.  I do feel safe and confident in this car.  It has a 4 cylinder motor, and therefore the gas mileage is great.  I average about 21 mpg in the city, and about 28-31 mpg on the highway.  

It has dual air bags, which is nice as well.  It is a car built for smaller people though.  I have a great field of vision while in the car.  The trunk room is enormous!  

Another great little feature is that part of the back seat folds down so that if you have something long to put in the trunk, it makes it so much easier.  The riders in the back have room, and don't feel cramped like most do in a smaller vehicle.  

I love this '98 Ford Escort!  <br><br>
