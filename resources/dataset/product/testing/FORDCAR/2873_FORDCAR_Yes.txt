            I bought a 1993 Escort used in 1994 as my first car. Now, in 2000, with 123,000 miles on this car, I still have it, and it's still in great condition, both body and mechanics, and I love it. It's easy to drive and is very roomy for its size, but it doesn't look like your mother's station wagon either (phew!)

As a young person just starting out, I have to have a car that doesn't cost an arm and a leg to maintain so I can get to and from work and do all the basics of everyday life. This car has not let me down. In fact, it took until my car hit 115,000 to need something other than basic maintenance! Through observing friends and relatives, I've noticed that it's fairly rare to go that long without something other than new tires, new brakes, oil changes, etc.

We live in Minnesota, and winter can be hard on cars. My Escort has done its best to keep me going in even the coldest of days. It has only refused to start due to cold once, and it was literally 50 degrees below zero that day. Heck, I refused to get going that day, too! I certainly didn't blame it.

This car gets excellent gas mileage. I find myself getting about 35-36 mpg on the freeway and not a whole heck of a lot lower than that in the city. I have been able to trust this car not to overheat in the extremely hot weather that Minnesota can get as well.

My only complaint about my Escort is that it eats bulbs like you wouldn't believe. No sooner do I replace one than another goes out. They can get rather irritating and expensive to replace, but considering all the other things that can go wrong with cars, this is definitely preferrable to just about anything else.

I highly recommend a Ford Escort for a first car for a teenager or for someone who enjoys getting a good value for their money in an automobile.<br><br>
