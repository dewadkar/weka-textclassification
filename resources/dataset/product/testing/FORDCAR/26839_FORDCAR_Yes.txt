               I writing this review not to trash such a powerful suv or say its greatbut the facts are in the last bench seat you have to be five four to be comfortable. I'm almost six foot and when I sat in back I was very cramped! The EDDIE BAURER EDITION is very nice and good looking, but me being a little over average size I recomend the FORD EXCURSION or the CHEVY SUBRBAN. but if there are going to be kids in the back instead of adults yuo are gonig to do just fine in this model. The thing that impressed me the most was the huge engine and excusite design and craftsmanship. But the price for the average model is nice the upgrades to editons and/or upgrades will quickly raise the price to a big number. so if you are upgrading be wise! certain upgrades are not worth the dealers price.
