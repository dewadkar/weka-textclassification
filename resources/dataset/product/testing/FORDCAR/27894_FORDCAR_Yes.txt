            The Ford Queen Victoria sedan is probably the best American made luxury car on the road today.  Though I myself do not own this car, my elderly parents do and I have had the honor of driving them on trips to my sister's home half way across the country in it.  

It rides like a dream.  Smooth comfortable rides are the rule not the exception in this vehicle.  The seats are so comfortable they could double as beds if they would lay back just a little further.  The lumbar support in them is ecstasy for my wife who suffers from chronic back pain, and its high profile makes getting in and out easy for my elderly parents.  

It is quiet.  Road and engine noises are muffled somehow to make it easy to hold conversations with people in the back seat without having to turn around to be heard.

It requires little to no maintainence outside of the usual 3,000 mile oil change and winterizing.  With the cost below $30,000 this is also one of the least expensive luxury cars on the road.

It is also hard to argue with the car that most State Police agencies choose for their officers.  It must be quality.<br><br>
