            I read the reviews about this car and I think the owners of this little bug are not very fair... I decided to write an opinion as well to express my feelings about the car I drive every day.

<b>Why I bought it</b>: first of all I was looking for a small car, with a great miles/gal performance that would fit into my budget. I wasn't looking especially for a new car, but even used, I wanted it as new as possible. I bought a '97 Ford Aspire in October of 1998. It was used but still under warranty for the next two years so I thought it wasn't too bad for $6000 (the price was way below the blue book value). I bought it from a German cars dealership that got it for a trade in (imagine somebody trading in a Ford Aspire for a Mercedes...).

<b>Features</b>: Ford Aspire was the follower of Ford Fiesta in the small cars line created by Ford. I think the first model was out in 1994 and they've only made it for 3 years (1997 was the last year). It has a Mazda 1.3L engine which delivers 63 horse powers at 5000rpm. You can find it either with 2 or 4 doors, manual or automatic transmission, with or without air conditioning. It also has:
-air bags for both the driver and front seat passenger
-34/42 miles per gallon (city/highway)
-huge trunk space

For a complete list of features I recommend the following site: http://Reports.IntelliChoice.com/reports/sponsors/NATIONAL/frameset.asp?SPON=national&amp;DEFSPON=CV&amp;PROD=1&amp;REPORT=9724010&amp;TRID=0&amp;P1=0&amp;YEAR=1997&amp;MAKE=Ford&amp;MODEL=Aspire

<b>OK! But how does it run?</b> This is my first car and I have no basis for comparison but in my opinion it runs great. It doesn't have much power and a &quot;nervous&quot; driver would hate this car. However I am mostly calm when I drive and I fit very well with the small engine. As for the long trips I am very proud about driving this car from Richardson, Texas (right next to Dallas) all the way to Canada in two days, 15 hours a day (going around 75 mph). Didn't have a problem, as a matter a fact I <i>never</i> had a problem with this car. Only once I had to call the dealership because the engine wouldn't start. They said it was the battery and exchanged it for a new one.
And if you are thinking about the room inside it, don't. There is enough  room for legs in front, as a matter a fact it is much more spacious than a lot of other cars. It is a little small in the back, but who's going in the back? I mean for a small family (me and my wife) it is just what we need.

<b>Conclusion</b>: I like this car and I consider it a great asset. It runs well, it doesn't eat a lot of gas, and beside oil changes it doesn't need a lot of money for maintenance.<br><br>
