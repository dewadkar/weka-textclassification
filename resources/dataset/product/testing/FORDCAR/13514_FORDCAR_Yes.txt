            I love my 99&quot; Ford Explorer, I'll never drive another car again.  It's a Explorer from here on.  I bought this sport utility because the dealership I was working with worked with me, on price and payments. They had the color and the truck was ready for me in 2 hours.  I walked in test drove and it was mine.  The Ford Red Carpet Lease plan is great and affordable. I love being able to see everything now, much different than being so low. Anyone that has small children should only buy or lease a Explorer that has 4 doors.  It's quite a challenge with car seats. <br><br>
