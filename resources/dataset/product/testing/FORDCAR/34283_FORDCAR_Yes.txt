            I purchased my F-150 for the simple reason that it had the horsepower I wanted with the highest mileage.  I am happy to say that, it paid off.  All the power with a average mileage of 18 mpg.  Plus it is a very comfortable truck to drive.  I love the extended cab, it fits my entire family of 5 comfortable.  The 6 cd changer is a great option also and it is in a good spot.  It's a head turner in the red, &quot;people love trucks&quot;.  I would buy another, there is nothing not to like about this truck.<br><br>
