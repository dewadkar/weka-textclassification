            I received a Ford Escort as a present.  It was a 1997 model, bought used in 1999.  It was been an extremely reliable and useful car, plus I think it is a very attractive car.  I have had no problems with it in over 10 months of ownership.  It gets good gas milage, I've had no problems with the motor.  The radio and tape player are good quality and give good sound.  The air condition is more than adequate to quickly heat and cool the car- if anything it is too good, because it can heat the car up before you realize it and make it too warm.  It is definitely a good car for the price, especially when purchased used from a dealer.  Because of the size, I would not recommend a family who has/wants more than two children, as the back seat is small to fit car seats in.  Overall, it's a great car for a small family or a single person.<br><br>
