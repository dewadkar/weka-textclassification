Compared To: I personally haven't owned any other vehicles as I said this is my first. However my mom has a 1997 Jeep Cherokee Country, my dad a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherrokee 5.9 Limited and my brother a 98 Chevy S-10 Extreme. They are all fun to drive and I would say get an SUV over a car anyday :)  

Review Summary: This is my first car or else I would have something sporty :) This car was chosen by my parents and given to me. After reading some of the other reviews i'm scared to death as to what could happen to me. But i've had the car for about 1.5 years now and I haven't experienced any of the problems that are stated here. The engine has 96,000 miles on it and the only things that have been replaced were the motor mounts, (ford recall) Alternator and the water pump. Other than that this car has been a real trooper. Acceleration with the 3 Liter V6 is a lot better than you would expect with a car this size. Really flies in 3rd gear. Gas mileage seems average. Anybody reading these reviews has probably already decided that the Ford Taurus isn't the car for them - but i'll go out on a limb and say that it has been an overall good car for me. Its always started when I needed it most and has never broke down on me as severe as some of these other people.
