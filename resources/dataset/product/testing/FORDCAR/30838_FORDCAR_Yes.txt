I have had my <b>1991 Ford Explorer XLT</b> for a little over a year. I bought it with 105,000 miles on it. During this time I have driven it for over 30,000 miles.  I have had it in the shop only for scheduled oil changes and tire rotations.

I drive every day for work in all weather conditions. I also drive my Explorer off road from time to time.  The Ford Explorer runs well and has excellent handling on snow and ice as well as in the mud.  I was particularly happy with my Explorer on December 28, 1999 when I was driving to Columbus from Cleveland as the first winter storm of the year blew through blanketing the streets with snow and causing white-out conditions.  I was driving south on US23 toward Columbus and I counted 14 cars along the side of the road. One accident was a 6 car pile-up.  After seeing these accidents, I was cautious but I felt comfortable in my Explorer.  Needless to say I arrived home safely and I credit much of my safety to my Explorer.

I have compared it to a Chevy Blazer of a similar year and
the Blazer does not compare.ï¿½ Not only does the Explorer have more storage
room, it is also much more comfortable to drive.

My Ford Explorer is very reliable and I feel safe driving it.  I highly recommend the purchase of a Ford Explorer.
