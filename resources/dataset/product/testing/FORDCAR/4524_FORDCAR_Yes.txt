            I bought my 1999 Explorer Limited V8 with 55,000 miles on it. It now has 68,000 miles and is as stronger as ever (stronger, actually). I've only had to do regular maintenance which includes an oil change every 4000 miles using synthetic oil (Mobil 1), new shocks (Monroe SensaTracs), and transmission flush, fill and filter change. It has a comfortable ride, though more trucklike than a car. Having owned pickup trucks for my last 2 vehicles, this is a much better ride. Someone stepping up from a car might feel differently, however. I like trucks but I wanted more of a "family" vehicle this time but didn't want to give up too much.

This vehicle is solidly built and, having driven an '03 Explorer which rides even better (4 wheel independent suspension), it seems like Ford is starting to catch up to the Japanese made vehicles in quality. There is one minor rattle that I'm sure I can fix by removing the front door panel but this is to be expected in a vehicle with 68,000 miles. 

I have done some upgrades as I am a bit of a performance fanatic: air intake, custom exhaust, and stereo and speakers. There are a lot of parts out there for the 5.0L V8's as Ford has been making this engine forever, though they went to the 4.6L in 2002 (I believe). 

Overall, I am very happy with my Explorer and hope it keeps me that way for many more miles.
