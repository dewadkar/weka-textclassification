            When I first bought my '91 Explorer it was to haul kids to sporting events because I'm a coach. This vehicle is great for this job, however the fuel economy was not the best at approximately 16.5 mpg. So my wife and I decided it would mainly be for me back and forth to work, until we found out how comfortable and easy it is to drive. We have a Corolla also and we were going to drive it on trips and weekends because of the fuel consumption of the Explorer, but no way! we drive the Explorer most of the time and the Corolla takes my wife back and forth to her work only.
It is not the best on ice and snow considering it is 4 wheel drive, but it is better than just front wheel drive, also it is heavy so it is hard to stop on ice, and it uses brakes up often, approximately 50,000 miles. It is much better than a truck, and I love it.<br><br>
