            Now that my sons are off to college, it was time to downsize and replace the Aerostar van with a compact Ford Focus wagon.
Having been quite pleased with other Ford vehicles, I started searching for a compact vehicle that would still enable me to transport a tuba, string bass or cellos (fringe responsibility of being a band/orchestra teacher).  As my research showed, there aren't very many options when looking for a wagon on a low budget. When all was said and done, the best buy for me was a Focus wagon.

So, I ended up ordering a ZTW wagon equipped the way I wanted it to be: side airbags, anti-lock brakes, metallic tundra with medium parchment interior. As a resident of New York, all 2003 models are shipped with the 2.3 liter engine which increases the horsepower and provides a little more zip. With 5,000 miles and three months of driving, I can share my likes and dislikes.

First of all, after driving an Aerostar van, Explorer and Crown Vic, the Focus is fun to drive. It has plenty of zip and handles very well. Around town and commuting to work, I'm averaging 26 miles per gallon.  On the highway, I've pulled 30 miles to the gallon. The car rides quite well and is comfortable for longer trips and will cruise down the highway at 70+ mph without a second thought. This puppy also has plenty of zip for passing trucks and turtles on the thruway!. Although I miss having power seats, the adjustment controls for position and height seem to provide adequate comfort adjustment. Road and engine noise is minimal.  Years ago, I drove and Escort wagon and hated it....the Focus is a vast improvement.  The rear seat folds down easily to create cargo room.  The telescoping/tilt steering wheel helps with driver comfort, and the basic sound system (AM/FM, CD) sounds quite good and has a ton of controls and options. Again...one has to remember that this is a budget compact....if you want more amenities, you'll want to move up to the Taurus wagon and be willing to spend several thousand more.

Areas of concern:

1. If you try to drive with the rear windows down at highway speeds, the noise is deafening.  This care has a design flaw  that Ford has not fixed.  I read about this before purchasing the car...but when it's warm, I use the air conditioner as I don't enjoy to noise that goes with open windows.

2. At the present time, oil filters for the new 2.3 engine are in short supply. It took my dealer some time to find one...they are on backorder from Motorcraft parts.

3. Why can't they put an exterior latch on the hatch door? To open the door, you must utilize the button on the key fob or the button located on the dash. A latch would have been nice.

4. If you plan on using this car with kids in the back, be advised that there is only one cup holder.  For crying out loud, why doesn't Ford provide at least holders for two drinks???

5. Rear seat has no head rests.  I think this is a real safety issue, and if I were going to be driving the vehicle with passengers in the rear on a regular basis, I may have had second thoughts about purchasing the car. Again, 95% of the time, I'll be in the car alone or with my wife. 

6. At the time I ordered, carpeted floor mats were standard, but they stopped including a cargo shade, and the mat in the cargo area is a carpet (no rubber/vinyl side for carrying messy items).  I ended up ordering a Weather Tech mat for the rear.

Finally, the car seems to be well built...fairly well finished.  With the Ford rebate and Ford dollars on my credit card, there wasn't another wagon that I could have purchased for the same or lower price. So, if you are in the market for a compact wagon, I'd give the Focus serious consideration but look carefully at other vehicles and choose the car that best suits your needs and finances.
