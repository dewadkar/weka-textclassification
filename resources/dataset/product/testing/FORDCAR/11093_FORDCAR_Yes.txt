            From the moment you climb into the cockpit of the SVT Cobra you realize you're in a high-performance muscle car. The wheel is wrapped thick with leather for optimal grip. The seats wrap around your thighs with the pedals within easy and comfortable reach for just about any driver. Turning over the motor causes the car for rock slightly from the torque; the initial roar from the exhaust quiets down after a moment and gives way to a gentle rumbling hum. You're met with a stiff clutch pedal that reminds you what kind of vehicle you're in. Depress it, ease the shifter into first and hold on... 

OK, so its a fun car to drive and its fast. Brakes are a dream. Cornering and handling are very acceptable. 

What it is: A suped up mustang in which Ford has replaced almost every part and has fine tuned each for optimal performance. It drives like a muscle car and rightfully so. Don't buy the car if you're looking for the ride of a Lexus. This is a reincarnation of the old "pony cars" from the late 60's and 70's. Price, Power, and Performance in order of importance. Further down the list are things like heated seats, dual climate control, compass, etc... basically, all that stuff that equates to higher sticker prices or lower power. You get one or the other, not both. 

It is a daily driver for a lot of us. Be gentle with the pedal, not every launch has to demonstrate the power the car hides. It actually gets OK mileage if you drive it with a little respect. I'm averaging about 18 MPG for my mainly city driving. Yeah, so 18 isn't anything to write home about but I'm certainly doing better than the guy who bought the Excursion to carry the kids he doesn't have and pull the boat he's looking to buy down the road... And, I can drop the top and cruise all around in a beautiful and very limited car. (only about 8000 Cobra's made in 2001 compared to the millions of cars Ford produced. my car is one of less than 250 of its kind in the world!) 

What it isn't: It's not a Corvette. That being said, it certainly doesn't carry the price tag or the hefty maintenance charge. It isn't a Lexus, again, see above. It isn't a maintenance hog despite the popular myth. Every car has its annoyances. its part of life. Ask the Porsche owner about maintenance and annoyances. Guess what, the enjoyment of driving such a fine car is worth some of the crud you have to put up with. The caveat, understand that when you buy a performance car, be prepared to pay more when things go wrong. Whether its a vette, a Jag XKR, or even a Volvo S80 T6. You're going to pay more for outages. 

1999 Cobra's did have some mechanical problems that were fixed by the dealer. The cars do make a little noise and the dealers do like to say "that's normal". Ford took the problems seriously. So much so that they opted against producing an SVT Cobra in 2000. (The Cobra R came out but it was a very limited, ultra high performance car that was several years in the works). When the 2001 was released, Ford had really created a wonderful product. Many Cobra owners believe the 2001 to be the best run ever for the money. 

Aftermarket parts are everywhere and this car is the perfect canvas for modifications. These cars scream off the production line but really let loose with a few mods. 

Bottom line. The SVT Cobra is a superb muscle car that is marketed to car people.
