             My husband and I got our first Ford in 1993 for $1900.00.  I was not to happy about it but my husband thought this was a great deal so we did.(Don't tell him this).  It was the best deal we have ever made. We probably would still own it but a 90 year old man ran  two red lights going 65 miles per hour and hit us and totaled out our car.  Almost totaled out me too!  But when the time came to get a NEW car,guess what your right another brand new FORD ESCORT!  After that accident I was so afraid to get behind the wheel of a car that I did a research of ALL kinds of different models and makes. A bit scared of the Ford Escort but after research I realized it was not the Escort fault that I got hurt so bad it was just the way we we're hit. The 84 Escort did not have air bags in my case would not have helped because I was T-Bone hit on the driver side. So today My Escort has air bags in which I did research and for sure air bags can save life. Sometimes they can do injury but not take your life.(but in some instances could not be helped) Also each door has a set of intrusion bars in which would have saved me from so much damage to my body.  This was put in the Escort 1990 and each one after.  I know I might not get hit again but I truly know when I get into my Ford Escort I will be as safe as I could be. We just have to try to KEEP the safety of others and ourselves on the roadway..DON'T DRIVE DRUNK- DON'T DRIVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS!(INCLUDING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS)DRIVE SAFE!
