            My husband and I bought our Explorer January of 1998! I love our Explorer! I like the way you sit higher than most cars/trucks. It allows you to see above some vehicles... making it somewhat more alert.

I love the style of the Explorer! It is such a big vehicle. We have had no problems with anything besides our brakes.

Okay... As much as I love our Explorer.. it has some downsides.  I use to think it had so much room... AS we added our second child, the back seats barely can handle two car seats and a diaper bag. A smooth ride it is not going over speed bumps. 

If you are tall (my hubby and I are both 6')  and have to have the front seats all the way back, the back people have no leg room. 

This SUV is great for someone who doesnt have tall friends or more than one kid. If you do, I may suggest a bigger SUV!
