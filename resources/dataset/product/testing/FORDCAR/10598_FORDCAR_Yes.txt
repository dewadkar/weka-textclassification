            the ford ranger is a tough little truck.  for me I like my truck to go off road and the little ford ranger is a mean off roaden machine.  the one time i have ever gotten it stuck was when me and some friends were off roading really off roading.  I burred it down to the frame.  it took a suped up off roader to pull us out.  the bad points is the radio has problems reciving if you live out in the boonies. The ranger is a quick truck and handles very well.  I would recomend an automatic rather a stick.  and the northland eddittion xlt.  go for the options it's got nice ones.<br><br>
