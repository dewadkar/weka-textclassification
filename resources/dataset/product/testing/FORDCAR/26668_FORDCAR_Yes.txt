            I am the proud owner of a 1995 ford escort. In my opinion, these are the sturdiest, best cars on the market. They are small and affordable. They are not gas hogs and are perfect for the daily commute to work. Some models of the escorts also have a sporty appearance which makes them awesome to drive. Contrary to popular belief that the escort contains a lawn mower engine, mine has often proven to be a very powerful machine considering the size. So, if you are looking for a small, economical car that won't give you a ton of problems, get the ford escort. <br><br>
