            The 2001 Ford Mustang GT is a fantastic vehicle if you are looking for performance and exterior aesthetics.  The 4.6L V-8 generates an awesome 260 HP and will get you from 0 to 60 in under 6 seconds.  The car is nimble and quick, and has abundant power particularly when you reach 4000 RPM.  Even at speeds in excess of 120 mph, the only telltale sign of your blistering pace will be the rapidly dwindling fuel tank indicator.  Handling is excellent, and the 17 inch tires grip the road like glue.  Braking is also very good (and this is critical for such a powerful car).

There is little to complain about with respect to the exterior.  The Mustang's body is supple and clearly reflects the muscle underneath the hood.  The convertible top fits snugly when raised, and when lowered, the Mustang is a real beauty.  Wind noise is only a mild inconvenience with the top down thanks to the powerful and well-designed Mach 460 stereo with a six CD changer.  My only complaint about the exterior is the ridiculous useless fake hood scoop (if only the scoop actually increased the airflow to the engine ala the Pontiac Firebird Trans Am "Ram Air" . . .).  The worst part about the bulging GT hood scoop emerges after a car wash -- no matter how hard you try to eliminate every bead of water from the hood, once the car starts to move or you leave it unattended for a few minutes, you will find a seemingly endless stream of water pouring from the scoop.  However, everything else on the outside of the vehicle looks fantastic.

The interior, sadly, and not unexpectedly, cannot match the wonder that lies beneath the hood.  On the plus side, the interior of the Mustang is much more comfortable and pleasing to the eye than either of its two biggest rivals -- the Chevrolet Camaro and the Pontiac Firebird.  The dual cockpit theme is commendable, and the gauge layout on the dashboard makes sense.  The aforementioned Mach 460 sound system is unbelievable, and is really welcome with the convertible top down.  The seats, however, are a big disappointment.  Unless you like the full recline position, good luck finding any utility in the headrests.  If you drive for more than two hours, expect to be rewarded with a severe backache (so keep a masseuse on call for these situations; on the plus side, the coolness of the GT might afford you a passenger who has a day job as a masseuse).  And forget about using the back seats for anything other than extra storage room -- leg room back there is all but nil.

If you have a lead foot (like most GT owners do), you might as well ignore the EPA fuel economy projections for the car.  The GT engine drinks fuel like a college student drinks free beer at a frat party.  Insurance costs are sky high as well.  The GT's attractive price (approximately $22K for the coupe to $27K for the convertible) more than makes up for the increased fuel and insurance costs, however.  When you consider the GT's abundant power, reassuring handling, handsome appearance, and decent interior, you will find few, if any, legitimate competitors in the sports car market.  Even though many Americans drive a Mustang, you will still be sure to turn heads in your GT, and more importantly, will be able to rocket down the highway at unbelievable speeds.  All and all, there is but one true American muscle car -- the Mustang GT!
