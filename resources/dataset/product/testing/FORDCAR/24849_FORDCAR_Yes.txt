            I purchased a 2000 Mustang GT new and have put about 16,000 miles on it so far.  This car is amazing, but that is because it gives me exactly what I want.  With it's base 260 HP and 300+ lbs of torque this car really moves and you can feel it.  The high amount of torque makes it a lot of fun to drive on the street.  It also runs very well at the track.  I have taken the car to a 14.00 @ 101MPH in stock form and I really can't drive.  I know people taking them well into the high 13s totally stock.

The exhaust in stock form is very nice sounding, but if it isn't enough for you there are many aftermarket parts available to help you fix it to your liking.  There are also a lot of aftermarket parts available for the car even though the market for the 4.6L in the new GTs isn't as big as the 5.0L it is getting there.  These engines have a lot of potential with the overhead cam design and react very well to forced induction.

The only things that this car really isn't that great with is a few of the parts quality and the lack of back seat space.  I know that most people buying a Mustang wouldn't care much about the back seat, but some may.  It really isn't comfortable for anything other than small children.  The issues with quality aren't overwhelming.  I have only had two problems with the quality of any of the parts so far and they were both because of me racing the vehicle.  I broke a clutch quadrant at the drag strip (which in turn friend my clutch) and I had snapped a clutch cable that I was using with my new racing clutch and aftermarket clutch quadrant setup.  The parts weren't designed to take the abuse I was giving them, but the clutch quadrant is a poor design.

Overall I would sum up the car by saying that if you want a car that is heavy on the performance and not as much on the comfort level this car is for you.  It really reaches back to it's Muscle/Pony car heritage and brings back the spirit of those cars.
