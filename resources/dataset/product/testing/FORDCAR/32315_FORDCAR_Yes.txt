            After a 5-year "break" Ford finally restores its new Thunderbird.  The Thunderbird has gone through many changes over the years.  Now, Ford has decided to bring back the T-Bird with the same "essence" as the original.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: Unmistakable, 1950's Thunderbird in a clean, modern setup.  The styling is very eye-catching to say the least.  Bits of chrome here and there add a bit of elegance to what is otherwise a sporty roadster.  Wherever the car goes there is sure to be a crowd.  I especially like the "eggcrate grill" and the hood scoop (even though it's not functional).

<b>INTERIOR</b>: About what you would expect in a 2-seat roadster, only a bit wider.  With the top up I feel cramped.  There is very little headroom for me.  The driver's seat is power-adjustable 6-ways, the passenger, just 2.  Personally, I like the power lumbar support.  Entry/exit is actually pretty good too due mostly to the fact that the doors are not too long.  The dashboard is shared with the Lincoln LS, though the T-Bird has its own gauges (black-on-white w/purplish/turquoise needles).  It takes about 10 seconds for the power-operated soft top to fold down.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The new Thunderbird is powered by a 3.9-liter DOHC V-8 engine that produces 252 horsepower at 6,100 rpm, and 261 lb./ft. of torque at 4,300 rpm.  It is mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission.  Both come directly out of the Lincoln LS.  Personally, I was hoping that a 5- or 6-speed manual transmission would be available.  Although the T-Bird's peak torque is at a rather high rpm, I feel it still provides good passing power even at low speeds.  I averaged only 15.8 mpg on the recommended premium fuel during my short test drive.

<b>HANDLING</b>: With a curb weight of 3,775 pounds, the new T-Bird is not as agile as most other 2-seaters.  There is little body lean in corners, and the 17-inch wheels provide good grip.  Despite the weight, the car is fun to drive.

<b>RIDE</b>: Although it's not as smooth as the Lincoln LS (they share platforms) it rides better than most 2-seat roadsters.  Ride-wise, it is much more comfortable than a comparatively-equipped Chrysler Prowler. 

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: The car is too new to tell if it is reliable.  It shares a LOT of parts with the Lincoln LS, though, but should be more reliable given that it is a brand new vehicle.

<b>VALUE</b>: Although more practical than most 2-seaters, the T-Bird does have its disadvantages as a 2-passenger roadster.  All in all, I think the new 2002 Ford Thunderbird is in a class by itself!
