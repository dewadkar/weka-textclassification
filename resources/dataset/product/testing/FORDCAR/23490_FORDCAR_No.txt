            I purchased an 89 Ford Taurus new because I fell for the hype &quot;Best selling car in American&quot; THAT DOESN'T MEAN A THING except a lot of people were deceived by the numbers. I've had expensive repairs all along and visited web sites that say Ford knew of the bad transmission (just spent $3,000 for a rebuilt one 6 months ago) when they were building the car. They even have a site with a lawyer suing the company. There are many, many people like me. Now I am faced with another $1,700 to fix the head gasket valve and engine mounts. I want another car but can only spend $8,000 for a used car. Don't talk yourself into a car before you do your homework and be practical about the car.<br><br>
