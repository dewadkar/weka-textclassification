            This truck has been no problem at all.  I don't wanna say something that will make it start to break, but hey, it's not been a problem at all!

I've done the serpentine belt, breaks, thermostat, air filter, spark plugs, tires, and battery.  After all that, and 136K miles, and 5 years, I'd say it's one heck of a car.

I have not religiously gotten my oil changed, I did it about every 15K to 20K miles.  I recently started getting it changed at a regular schedule, and got my radiator flushed.  Someone told me that the 4.0L truck engine from Ford has a tendency to be a problem if you don't get the radiator flushed regularly.

There is a problem with this model as it relates to the 4WD.  After 1996 Ford built Explorers with a modified truck frame.  The 1996 and previous do not have this.  This makes it necessary to rotate your tires a lot, about every 3-5K miles.  You might do this, but if you don't, you get some serious chatter on the tires, and some really bad road noise.

Outside of all that, the truck is great.  Performance ain't what it used to be, what do you expect after 5 years?  In any case, the performance isn't that bad, I can still merge onto the highway just fine! :)

Keep an eye on the recalls.  I replaced my anti-sway hookups before the big "Firestone Fiasco", and never owned any Firestone tires.
