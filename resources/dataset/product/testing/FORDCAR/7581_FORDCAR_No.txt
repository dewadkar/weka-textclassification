            When my friends started to find out I was driving an expedition they all called me big &quot;pimpin&quot; Shawn. Cause The big SUV's are supposedly &quot;pimpin&quot; cars. Well when you look at them.. yeah they are very nice in a monsterous way. They are hogs of the road. They need one of those signs on it that says oversized load. I don't like driving it cause its just too big. I always park it as far away from the other cars at parking lots cause I'm afraid I might not be able to get out of the car, or worse yet not able to back it out of the parking spot. 
The worst part of the car is it's amazing ineffeciency with gas. I end up never useing the air conditioner, because the amount of money I'm spending on gas is just so ludicrous. And it is taking it's toll on me. I live in southern California where the temperatures are soaring into unbearable levels. I can't complain about the amount of space the car has. It is very roomy. and you can fit like 7 people in it comfortably. This is defenitly a plus when your the designated driver at a pary or something of importance like that. If you have no need for the very large amount of space this car has... DO NOT PURCHASE IT. however if you have to move around a bunch of kids every day. or you need a very large carpool... THIS IS THE CAR FOR YOU. <br><br>
