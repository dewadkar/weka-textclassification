            I bought my 1996 Ford Contour as a program car in 96.  It had about 8,000 miles on it and now it has a little over 50,000.  I drive pretty rough and the car has withstood my beating.  I think its a good car and all, but I think it had too many recalls and problems.  Sure, I might have caused some of the problems.  I liked the car a lot and it got me from point A to point B.  But, sometimes it just made me mad.  One time I got in my car at night and the front headlights worked, but the dash and rear-end had no lights.  It was very dangerous driving home and later I found out that it was recalled for an electrical problem.  If you buy this car used make sure that the dealer has fixed that problem (they will do it for free).  This car was a little expensive on gas.  I have a 2000 Toyota Celica now and there is such a big difference on what I pay for gas.  The Toyota is much more gas efficient.  The only major problems I had with this car were that the rear bearings went and that there was a problem with the fuel filter.  Asides from those details, the car had a smooth and quiet ride.  I never broke down, so I felt it was rather reliable (asides from the one time w/the lights).  I would recommend that someone buys this car used only if the electical problem has been fixed.<br><br>
