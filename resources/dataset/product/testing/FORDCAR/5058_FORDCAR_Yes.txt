            I needed a vehicle that could handle a very high (600+ pounds) tongue weight on its hitch and that could seat four people very comfortably.

After weeks of research, I determined that only the Silverado or the SuperCrew (or the as-yet unreleased Tundra) would do the job.

I chose the SuperCrew because it has a better reliability record than the Silverado.  Because I am not willing to spend over $30,000 for a pickup truck -- or for any vehicle -- I searched for a late model used specimen.

My search ended when I found a 2002 Lariat version at a dealership.  It had 12,000 miles on it and was loaded.  It also has leather bucket seats, which I wanted because the bench seats are not supportive enough and I like the console better than the fold-down seatback version that comes with bench seats.

While I like the seats, they are just a bit narrow, which causes the side bolsters to bother my thighs a bit.

The rear seating area is outstanding.  At 6'2" I can sit comfortably in the rear, even with the front seats moved all the way back.  I have seen some models that do not have head restraints in the back; mine does, and I consider them to be very important.

I also researched engine choices very carefully and decided on the smaller V8, the 4.6 liter, because the 5.4 liter has had some reports of spark plugs blowing out of the aluminum heads.  When this happens, the entire head must be replaced -- very expensive.

The 4.6 has adequate power, especially for a 2-wheel drive setup as I have.

The ride and quietness are very good for a truck; somewhat jiggly, but secure.  Handling and braking are adequate to good.  With no load in the bed, the rear tires will break loose easily on wet pavement, a malady common to virtually all pickups.

I really like the automatic climate control system in my Lariat, as well as the turn indicators at the end of the mirrors, which give some warning to drivers on either side.

I also like that the truck came wired for trailer lights.

I am still getting used to driving such a large vehicle (I previously drove a Honda Civic).  I get about 15-16 mpg combined city/highway with conservative driving style.  People say to pretend there's an egg between your foot and the accelerator pedal, and I think that's a good idea.

Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.  This is the first modern American vehicle I've bought, and so far the experience has been a good one.
