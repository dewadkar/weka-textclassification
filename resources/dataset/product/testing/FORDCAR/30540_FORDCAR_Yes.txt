            I bought my Escort new in 1992 right after graduating from college as an inexpensive commuter with good gas mileage.  

This car is excellent for the RIGHT person.  It delivers with the great gas mileage and is very inexpensive to maintain.  I maintain my car very well and it has given me great service.  

POSITIVES: -overall inexpensive
           -roomy interior and trunk for a compact, I've driven X-country 3 times and have literally lived in the car for much of that time.  Fold down back seats make for more room too.
           -This car has the automatic seat belt system with separate lap buckle.  I love this but I think most people dislike it because they get strangled by the automatic cross-chest belt.  I don't though, I am used to it and love it.  
           -I like the styling, that's not as important to me, but some aesthetic appeal is important and this has it.
           -Nimble, maybe this is a function of my driving ability and familiarity with this car, but I feel I can maneuver it just about anywhere.  It is very easy to park and driver.  The manual transmission is wonderful.

NEGATIVES: -might be underpowered for some, I could do with a bit more power, but the gas mileage more than makes up for it
           -road noise, on the highway, the road noise is uncomfortable for me and tends to delete low end sounds from my stereo.  Something to look for when I get a new car, whenever that is.
           -safety, I think this car is rated pretty low on crash survivability.  I got into a major side-impact accident and had not a scratch but head-on maybe it wouldn't do so well.
          

This car is very unpretentious and will not turn heads.  I love it and even though I can afford a much, much nicer car, this Escort does all I need.  At 105,000 miles its getting on but still hasn't provided me with any major maintenance disasters.  If you are a practical person who enjoys good value and doesn't get caught up in affluenza (the consumer's disease) this is a great car for you. <br><br>
