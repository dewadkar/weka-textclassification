            I purchased a new 1998 Ford F150 XLT single cab two years ago.  Now pushing 33,000 miles, I have been extremely pleased with the vehicle.  The F-Series is the best selling truck line for a reason.  The truck has never given me any mechanical difficulty, and is a blast to drive thanks to the 5.4 liter engine.  If you buy an F-150, I would recommend choosing the 5.4 over the 4.6 or six cylinder.  You will notice a more responsive throttle, quicker acceleration, and an easier time when towing a boat or other equipment.  Another great thing about the F-Series is that, due to its popularity, you will have no problem finding after-market parts for your truck.  From brush guards to bed rails to performance chips, there is a wide variety of accessories available.  I also recommend a Flowmaster dual-out muffler to give the truck just the right sound, and a Superchips performance chip to increase torque and horsepower.  If I ever am able to part with my truck, I will purchase another new F-150 (perhaps a Lightning ;).  I have been completely satisfied with the performance, appearance, and comfort of the vehicle.<br><br>
