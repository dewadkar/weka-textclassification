            Bought a Ranger Trailhead on the A-plan six months ago.  For those of you that don't know what the Trailhead is it is a fake 4X4 (raised 4X2 with torsion bar suspension and the big Firejunk tires).  I have the 3.0 with the 5sp Manual.  It gets good mileage, around 20 in town and 22 on the road.  It is a great looking truck and there aren't that many Trailheads out there.  

There is a terrible grinding/squeaking noise coming from the dashboard, which to me sounded like an ungreased speedo cable.  The noise would start at 45 mph, get continually louder until about 75, and then quit altogether.  Since this vehicle is not especially stable at high speed, 70-75 is my usual max, which means I'm stuck with this irritating sound whenever I'm on the expressway.  

Took it back to Ford and mentioned that it might be a bad speedo cable.  The service manager laughed at me and said &quot;that'd be really difficult since it's an electric speedo&quot;  I felt real dumb and went home.  I crawled up under the truck and saw, if you can believe it, what looked like a speedo cable.  I took it back and a different gentleman said &quot;sure, it has a speedo cable&quot;.  They checked it and then said that they could not help me because the noise was caused by air entering my intake, and that was a design issue.  

Talk about shining you on.  Apparently they had better things to do that day than fix the problem. I'll have to make myself a permanent fixture at the dealership until they correct it.

I really like the truck overall, except for the instability factor and the irritating squeaking/grinding noise.  One thing that did scare me silly happened on I-71 halfway between Louisville and Cincinnati the other day.  I was in a leisurely unbanked turn when I hit a raised portion of the highway that had slightly buckled.  I thought the rear end on this thing was going to come back around.  If I didn't drive 8 hours a day for a living I might have lost it.  It shocked me to say the least, one of those losing your breath for just a second kind of things.  I think I probably would have been better off with the standard 4X2, but the Trailhead just looks so darn good. It's a tradeoff, you can look more boring but be safer, or look cooler banged up or dead.

I don't believe that the Trailhead is offered for 2001, so there won't be that many floating around.  If you want a lookalike 4X4 without that high price tag, these trucks are great.  However, with the really short wheelbase and ultra high center of gravity, they aren't for wild driving.  I must admit, I generally pray that I don't get sideswiped while driving on the freeway, cause this baby may end up defying gravity.<br><br>
