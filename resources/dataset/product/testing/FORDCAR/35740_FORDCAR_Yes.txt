            I had a Camaro that wouldn't quit breaking so fed up I decided to get rid of it.  I was actually looking for a import and my brother convinced me to just check out a mustang dealership in orlando.  So I did, as soon as I got in and cranked her up, rev'd the engine I loved my car.  
    The sound of the mustang is so mellow, you can hear the power in there.  Girls seem to love the it.  It just looks intimidating and smooth.  
    The Mustang has a pretty good size trunk, the back seats aren't very big, so I pretty much use mine to set my bag on or groceries.  The front seats are both very comfortable.  Unlike the Camaro and the Firebird when you ride in a mustang you don't feel like your driving a modern sports car, you feel like you are driving a real Muscle car.
I have the Mach 460 system with a JVC LH 3100 Cd player, I get great sound, I have never wanted to buy a sub, because I get as much base as I need which I never got with the Camaro.
All the switches and controls are easily reached while driving.  The AC is very cold.  And I have never once had a problem with my car, I give it a little better than regular maintenance and I keep her perfectly clean.
I have 99 GT rims on mine, and its also pretty cool to see all the Pony's all over the car, gives you a little more pride when you drive.  
I would never want another car, but I will probably get an older mustang 60-70 and a new one in the future.  
I plan on adding Black leather seats and then she'll be perfect for me.
