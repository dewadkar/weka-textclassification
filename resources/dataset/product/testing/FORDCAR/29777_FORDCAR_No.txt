            I recently was in the market for a used \SUV.  I went to the Ford dealer, to see what was in their used car stock. The salesman told me they had just received a 97 explorer on a trade, and he thought the car was in excellent shape.  I took his word for it, and took the car out for a test drive.  Let me tell you, this car was from from good shape.  It drove terribly.  The steering was loose and out of control,  the engine sounded like it was going to explode, and the acceleration and power were nowhere near what i expected them to be.  I told the slaesman what i thought and walked out of the dealership.  That testdrive indicated to me fords quality, and their desire not to have you pleased with your car, but to make a sale no matter what. <br><br>
