            I bought a 1999 Ford Contour brand new in 2000.  It was one that just hadn't been sold, and I got it for only 13,000, with power windows, locks, mirros, casette, everything except ABS and Cruise Control.

What I love about the car is the styling, inside and out.  It is very contemporary, yet not flashy, like some other new cars.  It handles extremely well, and even the four cylinder has great acceleration.  I wonder what the V-6 must be like?  Also, the gas mileage is great, I am getting nearly 24mpg on this car, which I think is great for a car of this size.
There are several things that I do not like about this vehicle.  One thing that bother me a lot are the seats.  They are not comfortable at all.  At least not the front driver's side.  It's okay for about fifteen minutes, and then my lower back starts burning.  However, I solved this with buying a fifteen dollar seat cover, that has eliminated this problem.  Another thing that bothers me is the placement of the power lock and window controls.  On the side of the door is not a good place, and I find it hard to reach.  Having it placed on an armrest on the left side would make more sense.  The only other thing I can complain about is that my car doesn't have the extra exterior styling parts that the SVT has, but, oh well.  Also, the rear seats seem cramped, but I have never had to sit in them, and am only 18, and will probably have a new car in about 10 years, so it should be fine until then.  But those who have to carry children around, but want to stay in this class may want to look at the Dodge Stratus (extremely roomy) but more expensive.

This car is very fun to drive, particularly on windy, hilly roads, where the nice acceleration and precise handling make rounding every corner a sheer delight.  

People who should buy this car are those that want good styling, a reliable car, good fuel economy, great handling, and fun to drive.  And those who want the room of a larger car, with four doors, but big enough to not be an economy car.
