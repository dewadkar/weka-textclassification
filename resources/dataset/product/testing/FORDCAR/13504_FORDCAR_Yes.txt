            I like the explorer it feels solid the interior has excellent by satndards and it a good V6 cummuter for me.I go on skiing trips with the explorer and it has been excellent all year round i think that it uses to much gas in so little time but i wont hold it against that because SUVs do that and to top it off it one of the best SUVs on gas..so it mainly good for a SUV but compared to small cars its poor.. or below average.I once took my explorer down the slop the thing did not slip at all i went down there at 80 MPH and didnt feel a thing and went down full blast!And the explorer has allwayes won all the 4x4 awards which the blazer hasnt but close. But the Explorer is still a gas buster !!!! and the Explorer is very good and strong,durable to handle routine cummute in every day life.!! very BIG the cargo is very very big !!! the interior is just amzing !! and you cant even hear a sound when you go down very quickly down the highway! acelleration i would say is above average!Thats what i would say.Get one get one FAST!! i enjoy mine you should too !! :) <br><br>
