            It was the first week of June in 1992 and as any normal teenager that was not in school <b>I was still asleep at 11 am.</b>  The phone woke me up with my Daddy dearest on the other end telling me to get up and get ready.  I quickly responded, �Do you have any idea what time it is?�  My father then replied, <b>�It would be in your best interest not to question me and get your butt out of bed and be ready by the time I get home.�</b>  As a teenager I was the one that would stay up all night and sleep all day.  All these questions were running through my mind as to what was really going on and what was he up to.

You see I had begun my first job in May and my father had told me that I needed to have a job before he would buy me a car.  Thus I would in turn have to pay for everything but the car itself.  Little did I know that this 16 year old would be getting her very first new car that hot, summer day in Arkansas.

We drove to the local Ford dealership where it is the only place my father will do business.  He is only a Ford man if you know what I mean.  By the time we arrived I still was not clued in that this trip was for ME.  Earl greeted us, as he is a friend of the family and my dad�s personal salesman for all his vehicle purchases including personal and business.  It was quite obvious that Earl had been clued in by my father and quickly asked me, <b>�Which color do you want, Tara?�</b>  My puzzled reply, �Huh?�  The three of us quickly walked towards the <b>brand new 1992 Ford Probes</b> that were on the lot.  My dad then told me to pick a color.  I chose red but then I was informed by my father that red was not a good color of a car for a female to own.  I was a little disappointed as I am the type that likes the flashy scene.  I looked at all the Probes on the lot and then I decided on white.  <b>My dad was quite pleased since he replied that white was the only color of a vehicle that a woman should own.</b>  It is funny that he still reminds me of this to this day.

So my dad asked me if the white one was okay with me.  And like any other 16 year old I replied, �YES!�  You can imagine I was still in shock.  I never really expected my father to buy me a new car since he had bought his first car himself and didn�t believe in buying it for me.  I am sure most of you know what I am talking about.

As I sat in my car for the first time ready to drive it home I am still in awe.  I actually pinched myself to make sure that I wasn�t dreaming.  Neither my father nor myself had ever driven a Ford Probe before but that is what he wanted me to have so he bought it without so much as a test drive from either of us.  I would say that I was quite a lucky young woman with a brand new <b>1992 Ford Probe LX</b> that was a bargain.  The vehicle retailed for over $18, 500 and my dad purchased it for $14,500.  Thus I was reminded quite frequently for the next year that the payments were running him in the neighborhood of $430 per month.  My dad always does the short term financing if he does not pay cash for a vehicle.

My <b>FORD PROBE LX</b> was the step underneath the GT model.  I was the first in the family to have a car that was an automatic.  I learned how to drive a standard before I was 12 years old.  That was all that was in my family and unfortunately the dealership only had automatics on hand.

<b>What features did my 1992 FORD PROBE LX have to offer me?

�SUNROOF

�CASSETTE PLAYER

�REAR DEFROSTER

�CLOTH INTERIOR, GRAY IN COLOR

�AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCKS

�AUTOMATIC WINDOWS

�A/C

�POWER SEATS

�MANUAL SHIFT BUTTON 

�CRUISE CONTROL</b>

The above items were the main attractions to me.  I really liked the manual shift button which was one of my favorite options.  At the press of the button it would allow you to shift like you were really driving a standard instead of an automatic.  Another favorite was the sunroof.  Since then I have become addicted to the <b>sunroof luxury</b> and will miss it dearly as the <b>Jeep Grand Cherokee</b> that my mother will be giving me soon does not have this feature.

Within a year my dad and I worked out a deal where I took some of my money that was left to me by my grandfather and I paid off the car.  At this point I could do what I had been dying to do since I received the car but he wouldn�t let me.  The first thing I did was get my windows tinted with limo tint and a Cobra alarm put on my Probe.  I then purchased a new Sony head unit and cd changer for my car.  Yes it was a great bargain once again that I received from my uncle.  I was a walking advertisement for his business.

My <b>1992 FORD PROBE LX</b> was an awesome first car for me.  The gas mileage was excellent.  I received approximately 22city/25highway mpg.  In the 3 � years that I owned my car I put a whopping 72,000 miles on my vehicle.  Yes, I was never home and always out and about with my friends.  My car drove like a sports car and looked like one too!  I never had any problems with the way it handled on the road.  The engine was a V-6 which my dad thought was going to be a little too much for my lead foot.  But anything less than a V-6 would not have been acceptable in my opinion. 

You may be wondering what happened to my jewel of a car.  A cold day in December 1995 a vehicle ran a red light and smashed into the right side of my car.  It was immediately totaled and I was devastated.  From the driver�s seat as I looked over to the right door I could see the ground outside as the door was completely caved in.  It was a miracle that for once I didn�t have anyone with me as I always had someone with me.  Luckily I was on my way to work and was just a few blocks away.  I was actually quite embarrassed as several of my coworkers showed up at the scene along with my boss.  It seems as a loyal customer had informed my place of employment that I was in a wreck.

I was quite lucky, as I only had to have stitches in my picky toe.  The only thing that saved me from further injury was the tint on my car.  It was what was holding up the shattered glass.  It was quite an amazing site.  I ended up getting close to $10,000 for my car from the other guy�s insurance company.  I was quite happy to find out that my Probe still had so much value being it was three and a half years old and 72,000 miles on it.

I then used this money and some other money I had to purchase my Mercury Cougar XR7.

I still to this day miss my baby.  It was one of the sharpest vehicles in town and by far one of the nicest ones compared to most teenager�s vehicles.  So many wonderful memories come to mind when I remember my <b>1992 FORD PROBE LX.</b>  It was a true gem.  It was an awesome car with no maintenance problems whatsoever.  I highly recommend this car if you can find one.  They are truly safe, cute, and economical.  The only thing I didn�t like was that my sunroof was not automatic.  If I wanted it completely off it would have to be taken off and stashed in the trunk.  Oh well times have changed and you rarely see sunroofs like this anymore.

<b>~HAVE A GREAT DAY~</b>
