            I bought my Ford Focus for economic reasons and found a car that has remarkable handling, good acceleration (great if you have the standard), moderate on gas, and the ZX3 model is remarkably roomy for 4 passengers or with the back seat folded down tons of cargo room.  The focus drives and looks (on the inside) bigger and better than it looks on the outside.
My opinion is anyone with a small family or first time buyers should look into this remarkable economy car with luxury handling. The focus I purchased is the ZX3 (hatchback) with a standard transmission and only basic options and I found that is all you really need in this car, it's quiet ride make the radio seem  loud at it's lowest setting which is both pro and con but to me it's a pro, so if you are young looking to buy a car that you can put a system in look into the focus, however if you are not into the ultimate radio system, the standard radio w/CD is of excellent quality.<br><br>
