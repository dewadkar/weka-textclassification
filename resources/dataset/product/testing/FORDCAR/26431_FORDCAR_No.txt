            Ford sets up extended warranty program costing ford 200 million dollar in response to class action lawsuit covering faulty engines in 94, 95 Windstars. Ford has since extended this program to cover additional models that have 3.8L V6 engine (tauruses, sables, mustangs). 2 million Ford vehicles are covered but not  96 Windstars. Ford gives horrible customer support. Replacement engine blocks are in high demand and on back order. It takes Ford 8 - 11 weeks to replace faulty engines. Center for Autosafety in Wash. D.C. is considering further action against Ford on behalf of 96 and later year Windstar owners. Stay away from Windstars!!!!
