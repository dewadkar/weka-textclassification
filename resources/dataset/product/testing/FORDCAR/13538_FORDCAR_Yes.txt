            We bought our 1999 Ford Explorer in July of 1999. We were expecting a baby later in the year and my little Chevy Cavalier just wasn't going to be fun to get a car seat in and out of. My husband and I really looked long and hard for the &quot;right&quot; SUV. We even rented a couple for a day or two at a time to get a really good &quot;test drive&quot;. We finally chose the Explorer because it wasn't &quot;too big&quot; and it was very comfortable. Of course, much bigger and far more comfortable than the Cavalier. We opted for the 4 dr,2 WD,XLT version. Living in Florida, we didn't feel that we needed the 4WD. I was especially pleased with the smooth ride that the Explorer offered and the many standard options. 

I really do enjoy my Explorer, but kind of wish I'd gone for the bigger Expedition. I like having the extra cargo room, but think I'd enjoy the optional third seat for more passenger room instead. There have been a few times that the extra passenger space would have come in very handy.
