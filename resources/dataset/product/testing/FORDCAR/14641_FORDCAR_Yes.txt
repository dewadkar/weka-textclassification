            After almost 2 ï¿½ years in the Focus I can say it is a great car. I really love the direct steering and the sporty feeling with the 5 speed manual and the stiffer European suspension that came with the Street Edition Package. Also the 4 wheel disk brakes with ABS are excellent and very aggressive. 
I also love the front sport seats and the nice 6 CD changer radio. 
Beside two recalls and a few cosmetic issues we never had any trouble with that car so far. It is roomy, reliable and almost economical. The fuel economy could be better. Ours is a 5 speed manual and I get about 32 miles on the highway which is not that great for car that size and weight.
The car has lots interior space and a huge trunk which is bigger that the trunks of many compact SUVs. Only the leg room for the driver could be better.

The cons are the bad quality bars of the factory roof rack. If you are thinking of getting a bike rack then you should go for aftermarket bars like Thule or Yakima. 
I also do not like that the rear seat can not be split on the bench but only on the back rest. So you can&#146t get a flat surface on one side only. 

And unfortunately Ford does not care too much about standard safety features. ABS, rear head rests, side air bags and rear disk brakes are only available as option. The VW Jetta wagon comes standard with these features.
And why does Ford leave the compartment for the A/C cabin air filter empty? This is only a $20 item. So if you want one you have to get one yourself from Ford. It is available as a replacement part.

What I would like to change/add:
A dome lamp for the rear seat would be nice because the front one does not reach that far, automatic A/C climate control which is available in Europe, a Diesel engine like the TDI from VW.

You may ask why I did not go with VW TDI wagon? It was not available the time we bought the Focus. I really like the Focus Wagon, but I would have the choice right now, I would probably go with the VW because the better standard safety equipment and the TDI engine.
