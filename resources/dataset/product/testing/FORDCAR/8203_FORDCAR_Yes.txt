            A year and a half ago, my husband and I leased a 2001 Ford Expedition XLT.  The primary reason was for the seating capacity; however, because we needed the cargo space, the third seat spent most of the 18 month period stored in a spare room.  When we needed it, it was a hassle to bring it down a flight of steps, remove all the baby gear and install the seat.  Even then, the short people had to sit back there for lack of leg room.

Problem solved in the 2003!!  The third row seat:  We were so impressed with the fold down third seat and the way it drove and handled, we traded in our lease with 18 mos to go on it and bought this car outright.  Granted, now we have the Eddie Bauer edition, but really there can't be that many differences besides little conveniences and novelties.  We opted for the manual fold down 3rd seat and I would highly recommend this over the push button.  Why?  Two reasons:  it folds down much faster and that's one less electronic device to go bad in the future.  There is more leg room for those sitting in that rear seat also. 

Safety features:  The middle row passengers have a shoulder belt in addition to the lap belt.  This is great because I can now put the baby in the middle where she should go and feel like the seat is more secure.  We got the air pillows on the side - an option, but a very good one.  This, I thought, would help my children and the front row passengers in the event of a side collision.  There would be something between their little heads and the glass then.  Ford changed the way the front of the vehicle is as well to assist in accidents.  The way it was explained, since we haven't experienced it firsthand, is that the bumper is more in line with the average car.  This will help on impact - help both vehicles in fact.  I know I like the bumper on this new one.  The other model stuck out too much and I'd run into the garage wall a little too often (slightly kidding).  

Enhancements:  the bigger mirrors are wonderful!  I get a better sense of what is coming up behind and what's on the side.  The middle row seat is split 40/20/40.  The 20 part of that can be pulled forward, so that when the baby is in her car seat, the passenger can reach her easily (or me at a stop light).  The climate control is great - no more either too hot or too cold.  Remote rear door entry - I like this in case I'm shopping and just want to drop the bags in the back without opening the entire car.  You can also open just the window portion of the back.  The rear windows by the 3rd row open out a bit, allowing for a nice air flow with the windows or moon roof open.  The option of automatic headlamps, so that if you are in a cloudy area, then sunny, then back to cloudy, you don't have to constantly fool with the lights.  They will come on automatically according to the sensor.  The ride!  I almost forgot!  It's like a car.  When going over speed bumps, the wheels are independent and I can go more than .002 mph over a bump now!  It rides much, much better than the old version.  The seats are more comfy and slightly bigger, too. Even with the 3rd row up, I can put the stroller in the back - something I couldn't do in the previous model.

Other perks:  The CD player is now in the dash, giving more room in the center console.  There are two memory positions for the driver's seat.  This is great for one main reason:  when someone else gets in the car and adjusts the seat (hubby, guy who changes the oil, etc), I can adjust it back easily and quickly without trying to do it while I'm driving. The second row seats are much easier to move and fold down for those getting in the very back.

Some things I don't like as much:  the mirrors move down when in reverse.  This could be a good thing, but I can back out just fine and it seems like it will be one more electronic thing that could go bad.  I miss the glasses holder since we have the sun roof - seems like they could have stuck one somewhere.  There are a million (well, maybe about 11 ) cup holders - who drinks that much?!  When they put the CD player in the dash, they removed the cassette that went with it before.  Although I rarely used it, the option was nice to have.  Could be an option we didn't know about (to get a cassette player)
