            My husband surprised me for Christmas with a brand new 2000 Ford Mustang, I was a little worried when he pulled in the garage with the new car because we had not been looking at this particular car to buy.

Well, now that I have been driving it for a month, let me say I am very happy with his decision to buy a mustang! He chose the V6 coupe and this car has enough power to get me where I need to go fast!  It is extremely comfortable to drive and feels like the car is totally wrapped around you when you are sitting in it.  It handles very well, the brakes and steering are quick to respond.  Also, the car feels heavy, so even though it feels like a snug fit, I feel safe while I am driving it. The 190 horsepower gives you enough power to drive up hills and cruise past most pass without any effort at all.  I absolutely love this car and am always looking for a reason to drive somewhere. Also, for a V-6 it gets fairly good gas mileage at 27mpg.

I must admit however, that I am a big Ford fan, and have driven fords for almost as long as I have been driving.  But the Mustang is probably my most favorite.  I can also vouch for Ford's dependability, as I have never really had any major problems with any of my previous Fords.  With this new 200 model Mustang, Ford has really gone all out.  I am very impressed and so is my husband (who I never thought would buy anything but Honda's!)  

The only problem I do have is that there is not very much room in the back, so it is really not a family or passenger car, but we manage anyway. Also, the trunk space is pretty tight so it is hard to fit anything but the big stroller we have inside.  But somehow we manage, and I would not want any other car.  I am definitely Ford satisfied!<br><br>
