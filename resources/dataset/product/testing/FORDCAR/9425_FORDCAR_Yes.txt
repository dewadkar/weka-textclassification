            As kids in the 60's, me and my brother nailed a 2.5 horsepower Briggs & Stratton upright engine onto a wooden go-cart and after many failed attempts of push starting we finally got the thing to work. I am not sure if I was the one driving the cart, or if it was me running behind, but I do remember the huge cop car suddenly looming up from behind us and, to our utter horror, pulled us over.  The officer let us off with a warning and ordered us to push the thing home, but the sheer joy of our success, undoubtedly like what the Wright brothers must have shared, will never be forgotten. The feeling of that chugging little engine that could, tugging us forward with each tut-tut-tut! In spite of our shocking encounter with the policeman, the driving seed was sown. I still wonder where we got the baby coach wheels for that go cart...
Fast forward to 2003 and picture the go cart morphing into a black, new Mustang GT.

THE TEST DRIVE
I knew as soon as I began driving: THIS WAS MY CAR. No whimpy off the line acceleration like the RX-8. I could feel myself connected to the engine. It's kinda like the "MATRIX" movie; no one can be told about the experience; you have to hear and feel it for yourself. I was intrigued but would not let on, forcing the smile away that was playing at the corners of my mouth. I shot through the night traffic, launching from stop light after stop light, feeling an incredibly powerful engine hurl me forward. Somebody smack me! I must be dreaming! At last a vehicle with some power! You must understand however, one of my former cars, a 1.3 liter Renault Alliance, would slow down when going over bridges. My last car was a 160 HP Camaro V6. This Mustang had 100 more ponies on tap and it was a V8. The shifter was notchy and a little too far forward, but my '93 Camaro was so notchy when new that it was hard to fing reverse. The Mustang's shifter is better, but don't count on very fast shifting.



INSIDE MY NEW CAR
I realize the front seats, unlike my 93 Camaro, do not fully recline. This was a major bummer with me as I love to nap during lunch breaks or at security policed rest stops during long trips. I found I could nap, however, by reclining the POWER seat as much as possible and using the rocker seat control to rock it back to the max. If worse comes to worse I could pull forward the rear seat backs, revealing a thru-way to the trunk interior and figure a way to stick my legs thru and catch some Z's. I know; sounds crazy, but the streets have always been my second home, whether I am on a motorcycle or in a car. At age 22 I traveled from Long Island NY to Mexico and then to Florida on a 100 cc Honda. I could go 55 MPH with the wind at my back. Camped in a tent that way for 3 years. Ahhh the 70's...but I digress...
Interior looks good, but hardly Mazda RX-8 or even Mazda6 quality. I would have preferred some AC vents that completely close instead of the dated rectangular ones. At least you can direct the air direction well with them.
The Mach 460 six CD sound system is plenty loud, but seems to lack the tonal quality I was hoping for. But it is the best car stereo system I have ever owned. The headlight pull out switch is something I would expect from a really retro vehicle. All of the other controls, including windshield wipers and cruise control are quite intuitive. There is plenty of head room for my 5' 11" frame.  Rear seats are suitable for small kids. Trunk space is great for a sporty car.  One of my co-workers wanted to see if I had a full sized spare and pulling up the trunk carpeting he ripped the soft padding. I wanted to grasp him by the throat and strangle the Bejesus out of him but restrained myself. Nicks and dings commeth and no man knoweth from whence they shalt come.

EXTERIOR
I cannot say which car company started the muffin car craze; probably Japan; but almost every car company, including Ford, seems to be following head over heels, or at least to a certain extent. What's a muffin car? A vehicle whos design is devoted to the curve. Example; the Ford Taurus and most Oriental makes. I suspect Honda to be the instigator or pioneer in this; you decide the appropriate word. A car that is agreeable to the masses yet dares not stand out. That, my friends is the muffin car. It has invaded U.S. shores and we Americans can't get enough of them. The design is everywhere, from sport cars to SUV's. Curves are in and the curvier the better. I could not buy a Honda for this reason. It's a friendly, generic but spineless design that dares not to contain any imagination. And we Americans eat it up with a spoon. But if anyone will notice; what was long ago different has now become common place and boring. Volvo held out for awhile but I can see the curves comming in with them also. I don't want a mommy mobile. Sorry Mazda6, the sport package makes you look like a souped up family sedan. Enter the square cut Mustang, looking like a step child about to misbehave...
It's appearance is open to opinion. This car would need very little modification for a movie roll; it's oversized fake hood scoop and side panel vents may get you the super hero roll, but I think rolling up to a mansion for a wedding in one of these will only get you snickered at; a racer boy reputation. Let's put it this way; it satisfies my inner child, and I mean that. May as well keep those GT premium wheels and don't opt for the bright chrome wheels. Don't try making the car into something it's not. The GT Premium wheels fit the car. They have a classic style and have  gotten me many compliments. Besides, I don't expect to be rolling up on any mansion weddings any time soon. Get my drift? When I look at the Mustang GT I see the last example of the American muscle car. The design engineers should be given a medal. They have come through for us. Pontiac screwed up the design of it's new GTO big time. It's one of the most generic designs out there and let's face it; the new GTO looks NOTHING like the origional. The new 2005 Mustang design ROCKS. THAT'S what I'M talkin' 'bout...Too bad it is a two seater, otherwise I would've waited.

DRIVETRAIN
There is plenty of locomotive power on tap for effortless passing or showing off. At 1500 RPM I am only running at 60 MPH. The engine is loping lazily along at just under 2000 RPM at 75 MPH.  It sounds busier though, but the low hum is probably the exhaust combined with tire road noise; this is a sports car ya' know. Redline is about 5750 RPM. At last I do not have to worry about not having enough power to zip me out of tight traffic situations. A pedal to the floor and I can leave my problems; all the muffin cars and econoboxes competing for the on-ramp from the toll booth, far behind. 
Update December 2003: I find this car can start from a full stop in 2nd gear with relative ease in normal traffic. This is a good thing since I find 1st gear is relatively short winded. At 4,500 miles I got about 20 mpg in city driving last time I checked, but don't quote me; I'd better check that again.
Steering is very accurate if not overly sensitive on the highway.
Braking is very good in my opinion. 

RELIABILITY
With only 249 miles on the odometer I cannot comment.


Once on the street I began to notice something strange about this car. It was attracting cops like a magnet. I would be just cruising along and notice a cop car passing me by, apparently giving up hope of ticketing me. Then another, then another. Hey guys, I know I look like an easy mark, but I am just a 52 year old who has never even seen "The Fast and the Furious" movie. I'm just trying to poke along and save some gas here. My last test only gave me 15.67 mpg. Maybe if I drive like a water walking saint I will get 17 mpg. I have yet to drive a long trip, and expect highway mileage to be better.  

UPDATE SEPT 2003:
I am in the midst of taking a trip from Florida to  Atlanta Georgia. I read about others getting 26 mpg highway but only could partly believe it until now. Driving at about 68 MPH with the AC running I could achieve 26.7 MPG. Driving at 70 MPH let me come away with 26 MPG. With an average of about 26 MPG highway, this makes me like my new Mustang GT even more. City driving is still about 16 MPG however.

These cars, from my research, are not even on the top 10 list of cars most stolen, to my surprise. Still, I contemplate a Lojack for my little V8 Stang.  

When all is said and done I like this car. Would I buy another? Frankly yes. Not that it is the best mind you, but you get so much, even leather was included in my price. I just did not see a better deal out there with more bang and goodies for my buck. Honorable mentions were the Mazda6 and the Toyota Celica. If I had to do it all over again I would consider more seriously the Mach 1 however.

You only go round once in life; why save it up for your grandchildren? I just wanted to know at least one vehicle with some uncomprimizing brute horsepower  while I am still able to drive. And now I don't just merely drive; I can enjoy driving, you know, with enthusiasm, being able to feel and hear what I am driving. What's the point of driving something that insulates you from itself? There is life is in this vehicle. It's in the rumble of the engine! It is in the handling and power! Don't you get it? Don't you remember?  Like that time me and my brother hammered together that wooden, chugging, motorized go cart. It finally came to life, surging ahead as I left my brother running behind, shouting for joy. The Mustang has brought  that nearly forgotten memory back for me.
