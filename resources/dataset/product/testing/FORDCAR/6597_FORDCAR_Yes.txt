              After paying off our car we realized we needed something bigger because we have two little boys.  After looking around, it seemed that the F150 supercab was the best deal on anything that would seat six people.  I have always wanted a truck but this is the first one I have ever bought.  It was a toss up between Ford and Chevy but at the time Ford was the only maker offering incentives to buy... so we went with Ford.  We settled on the V-6 because Murphy's law states that when buying a new big vehicle, the price of gas will surely go up, and it did!
   The interior room is very good and it will indeed seat six.  The A/C works great and the stereo is good too.  Road noise is quiet and the automatic tranny shifts good and you can lock out overdrive for more pep if needed by just touching a button.
   The body is sturdy but our XL model lacked any door ding strips which are sorely needed on a vehicle this wide.  The motor has good power but is slightly noisy from the outside (you think Ford would have caught that).
   The only warrantee issue was a defective instrument cluster which we had to bring back 2 times to get it replaced.  The hood got scratched while in for the cluster and they had to repaint it without much hassle.
  This is a good family car, believe it or not!  It is attractive, sturdy and useful for many purposes.  I hope to hang on to this one for a long time.  If you don't want to follow the SUV fad and might want something more practical look into this model.  The four doors work well and when closed only look like two.  I traded this truck in for a 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 at 37,000 miles and 3 years old.  The clear coat paint was cracking all over and would have needed a complete paint job before paying it off!  This could have been an issue because it was black and the Texas sun is just too hot.  I am not sure though.  Overall I was happy with the truck in everything but the paint quality.
