            I just bought a Ford Escort ZX2, and I am very happy with this fun little car.  Price was the determining factor in my purchase, and the Escort is close to the bottom price bracket for Ford autos (I've always been a Ford fan.) Just because the car is relatively cheap doesn't mean that the quality has been skimped on...this is a well-built car.  I have put 2,500 miles on it and there are no squeaks or noises indicating loose screws etc., nor have I noticed any other problems indicating shoddy workmanship during construction. I'm very happy with the interior layout, with all controls being very handy &amp; laid out well.  It is a little car though...if you're over 6 feet tall you may have trouble sitting comfortably in the driver's seat (I'm 5'10&quot; and my head brushes the ceiling when sitting with the seat all the way back.) The seats are very comfortable, and have good lumbar support.  I've only made one extended trip (of 3 hour duration) and found the seat to be fine for the whole trip. (Long trip seat comfort is important to me.)  It is a quick little car, and gets up to freeway speeds smartly...seems to handle well, although I haven't had it in the snow &amp; ice yet. It does seem like it will be fine in inclement conditions, but time will tell. I am happy with every aspect of this vehicle, except one minor oddity...I can't get the interior dome light to come on when the doors open. I have the moon roof, so the 'dome light' is not really a 'dome light', but it is different (and not necessarily good) not to have a light come on when the doors open.  All in all I am very pleased with this vehicle &amp; would recommend it to anyone looking for a relatively cheap, well-built, compact car.<br><br>
