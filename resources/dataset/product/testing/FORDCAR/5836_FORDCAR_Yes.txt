            The Taurus SHO is the perfect wolf in sheep's clothing.  It looks like a Taurus, but it has the (Yamaha) heart of a racer.  With a little after market help, the SHO can dust almost any sedan from Europe or Japan, leaving them baffled. 

When Ford decided to make the SHO performance sedan, they selected the Yamaha 3 liter, 24 valve, DOHC engine.  It is possibly one of the best and most reliable high performance engines ever produced.  It is conservatively rated at 220 HP.  But with a few after market tweaks, 260 to 280 HP are possible - and not expensive.

The SHO bucket seats are the best in any car with the exception of the optional seats in the C4 Corvette.  I like soft seats with some padding in the seat cushion, since I don't carry a built in cushion.  I find the Euro-Seats to be hard as park benches and they hurt my behind after awhile.  The SHO seats support your tail in comfort and you can adjust the seat in almost any direction.  I recently drove my SHO 1800 miles in two days in pure comfort.

The 4 wheel disc brakes are fantastic for street use.  Stopping distances are short from any speed.  So short that I carefully watch the cars behind me that can't match the braking distance.  The Bosch ABS is also among the best I've experienced.  

I will concede the brakes are not up to track use or auto-crossing.  I had to replace pads and rotors after a hard day at the auto-cross a few years ago.  Too much heat build up seriously warped the rotors.  There are lots of after market fixes for the brakes, if you choose to upgrade.  

The Mazda transmission is the weak spot of the SHO.  It just isn't up to handling all the power of the Yamaha engine.  Many SHO owners have problems with the clutch and tranny.  The problems can be fixed for about $1500 by a few SHO specialists throughout the USA.  

This is another problem with the SHO - Lack of skilled mechanics - and it's even worse now that SHO(s) are getting scarce.  I would let the local Ford shop work on the Taurus part, but the engine and transmission needed a SHO mechanic.  I drove 700 miles to Wisconsin for the 60K maintenance and was glad I did.  I'm going to L.A. for the next maintenance.

My SHO is 11 years old and has had a few problems.  More problems than I would tolerate in a normal car, but I am more forgiving in view of the extraordinary performance.  I drive the SHO hard and it comes back for more.  

Problems:

The OEM tires, Goodyear GT 4(s), are noisy.  Dunlops and Bridgestones are much better.

The OEM clutch failed at 30K miles and was replaced under warranty.  The clutch now has 98K on it and is beginning to slip.  Brake Booster failed at 50K miles and cost $330 to replace.  Starter failed at 90K and cost $350 to replace.  A/C failed at 100K.  Not repaired and I live in Phoenix.  Crankshaft Position Sensor failed at 102K.  Cost:  $300

Really not much maintenance for 130K miles.  I change oil every 5K miles and use Slick 50.  The engine is still running like new.  It has used one quart of oil every 5k miles since new.

The SHO is a great car for us middle aged guys lacking in maturity.  It is a perfect stop light racer.  It's a win-win.  If you dust someone, they got beat by a Taurus.  If they win, so what?  Either way their ego is deflated.

I would never give this car to one of my teenage sons.  It could be very dangerous for someone not used to the sudden acceleration.  The SHO will top 140 in stock form - so do be careful out there.
