            The Fox body escort built from 1987 to 1993 is among the most popular and most configurable cars for nearly any form of racing. It serves as an excellent canvas for those wishing to affordable enter the on track arena. The aftermarket performance parts available are simply extraordinary - everything from suspension kits to superchargers are widely available from dozens of ford Shops throughout North America. 

One of the most popular applications for escorts of the era is a drag racing set up. You could opt for an automatic transmission and fit it with a 3500 stall converter, or go for the heavy duty T-5 or Tremec 5-speed. There are limitless options available for the engine - carbureted, fuel-injected, supercharged, big block, etc. Depending on what class you choose - stock, modified, funny car - you'll have certain restrictions on what can legally be done to the car. This is one Pony Car that can really go fast in a straight line.

Alternatively, you could choose to go in completely the other direction - road racing. The twisting, turning, undulating road courses are not initially receptive of the Fox Body chassis in stock form. The body is highly flexible and can lead to a huge amount of oversteer when coupled with the very capable 225 HP stock 5.0 V8. Here's my advice on setting up the Fox Body for autocrossing or road racing (this assumes you already have the appropriate tires for your intended application).

Check out whether the doors close well. A misalignment of the doors could indicate that the car has been abused as a result of the body flexing under very hard acceleration. This flexing evidenced by the door problems can be exacerbated by the approach most 5.0 owners take to upgrading the car. Most tend to start by adding more power without first bracing the chassis. This only adds to the stresses placed on the suspension during acceleration.

The first stage of upgrading any Fox Body chassis should be adding subframe connectors. Make sure that you choose the weld-in type which has crossbraces. These serve to connect the front and rear subframes of the suspension. After a proper installation, there will be an immediate change in body roll stiffness. This is also a good idea to add to the drag racing Mustang. 

The next thing I would recommend would be to add a 4-point lower K-member or G-load brace coupled with a strut tower brace. The effect will once again be dramatic with the stiffened front subframe. Following this modification, jump into the shocks and springs. You'll want to choose a matched set which were designed to work in concert. Keep in mind that if you reduce the ride height too much (more than 1.5&quot; or so) you'll radically alter the suspension geometry such that you will increase dramatically the amount of bump steer - this means when you go around a corner you'll feel the car surging, or bumping. To counteract this effect, you'll have to get off-set rack bushings to reduce the angle between the steering rack and the wheel. You will also need to include adjustable caster and camber plates to take the greatest advantage of the reduced ride height and suspension dampening. I would recommend starting out with 1.5 degrees of negative camber if the car is also streetable. Keep in mind for the straight line crowd (drag racers) you'll want a set of shocks and springs completely different to help you with transferring weight to the rear wheels.

Continuing the road racing Mustang set up, you might want to consider replacing all the suspension bushings at this point with a polyurethane variety. I would also highly recommend a new set of upper and lower rear control arms. These will add the much needed &quot;hook-up&quot; that you'll need to adequately benefit from all the V8 muscle.

Next you'll probably want to look at changing the rear gear ratio. 2.73s are stock for most years, so I would highly recommend the 3.73 gears since there's no perceptible change in fuel economy or top end speed (until you start getting above 140 mph or so - on the track of course). While you're back there you might as well rebuild the limited slip, too. Combined with the upper and lower control arms, this will turn the 5.0 into a rocket without even touching the motor.

So, as you can tell, there's a lot you can do to turn the Blank Slate into a top performer with some work and perseverance. My favorite story about my 87 Coupe is during my first trip to Summit Point Raceway, WV (2.5 mile road course). I was barreling down the 3000 ft. front straight hitting about 120-125 mph (and having just past two cars) I was getting ready to enter the first turn pretty hot - I did a 5th gear to 3rd gear heel-and-toe downshift pointed the front end to late apex and planted my right foot on the accelerator. The tail came out just the slightest little bit as I kept my foot into it. I was able to carry a lot of momentum and in heading for turn two, the instructor sitting in the passenger seat asked - &quot;Is this suspension stock?!?&quot;. I mustered a terse &quot;Nope.&quot; as I four-wheel drifted through the next corner.
