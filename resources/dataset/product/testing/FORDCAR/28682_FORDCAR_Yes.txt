The 15 passenger stretch 350 version of the econoline has several distinct benefits and advantages for those who need a lot of room and a lot of power. You'll find that the space, cargo handling capacity when all seats are removed, is really incredible. With seating in place, the van still has room in the back for cargo, and room in the rest of the vehicle for a lot of passengers.

You typically find these vehicles in commercial service: Taxi, delivery, and church bus uses... and true, this is an ideal vehicle for all of these. I was first impressed with the power and pickup of a van as big as the extended length version. This is a really long, really heavy, really responsive and powerful van with an engine that can really get up and go when you want that acceleration. Great for towing too... but as big as the interior is it's hard to imagine anything that you'd want to tow that wouldn't fit inside!

Fit and finish is as good as any utility vehicle these days. There is ample room for storage and convenient places for drinks, change, maps, doo-dads, in the center console area. Visibility is great too, for such a large vehicle, which makes parking and moving through heavy traffic a breeze. The height of the driver seat really helps because when you sit in this van you're above all but the tallest SUVs.

The price for this much size and this much utility, strength, and relative comfort, is really reasonable. The average price is the mid to upper 20s fully outfitted if you shop well. This is a good value and a lot of van for the price. Now, if it were only available without Firestone tires...
