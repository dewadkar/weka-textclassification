            I purchased my used 2002 Ford Windstar in January 2003.  We had a 1998 Ford Expedition 4X4 that had a lift kit and 33" tires , dual exhaust , the works that we traded in on it.  Man was I stupid ( I guess ) . Over all I guess the 2002 Ford Windstar is ok . I like the ride that it gives you .  The looks of the Windstar are another pro of mine , I am generally a GM person my self (wife likes the Fords) and I am not to fond of the Chevy Venture body style .  The Windstar does have about the best braking system I have seen for a while with the exception of the all time Ford brake dust on the rims problem .  One thing that my wife and I truely love is the VHS/Tv entertainment system .  We have two daughters and one more on the way ( 12 , 14 months , due in April ) The entertainment system keep them so QUIET . 
There are some quirks that I am not real pleased with .  The rear heat only blows from the drivers side rear side panel near the floor, it is extremely noisy if you turn the fan up to the second fan setting or higher. I dont understand why they couldn't have designed it so that when you want the heat to blow hot it would come from the roof vents as well. The engine is extremly noisy when you first start it , it sounds like something is sucking a lot of air in it , it generally clears up after a minute or so. The engine is fairly noisy if you try to pass someone.  The Windstar has the typical Ford electrical problems.  Every Ford I have ever owned has had moderate Electrical problems .  I have had problems with the brake lights staying on after the vehicle is parked and you have gotten out of the vehicle , I took it to the dealer to have it fixed but it never would do it for them, isn't that always the case. The 1998 Expedition I had , right before I traded it in I was spending about $400.00 each month for about 3-4 months on electrical repairs. I have had to have the sway bar links replaced ( warranty )because of a clunking noise I would hear when I would turn into a parking lot that had a dip at the entrance . I had the same problem with the Expedition as well . Since I had that fixed about two months ago I heard the same noise a week ago , had the dealer to check it out , they drove the van and couldn't hear anything ( not having good luck getting these problems diagnosed at the dealer ) 
All in all I guess the Windstar is an acceptable vehicle . There are a lot of other vehicles I can think of that I would rather have but it serves the purpose for now. I probably won't buy another when I do get rid of this one , I  believe I will be getting another SUV , perferablly GM.  Good Luck if you have one or are thinking of purchaseing one.
