            If you want a good sports car do not buy a ford probe. I had a 95 ford probe for 5years. It was the worst mistatke that i have ever bought. Its a good car for the price you pay but i do not like the way the car handles. If you want to by a good sports car i would choose a ford probe. They are nice cars and are worth the money. Plus you have all the mustang clubs and all that. I had a lot of breakdowns with my probe. Also it cost so much to work on a ford probe. A new batter alone cost me $85.00 so if your looking for a care that is easy to maintian and cheap do not but the ford probe. Oh yea the quit making it. That should tell you somthing <br><br>
