            Well to start off my mom was looking for a car and mentioned how she'd always wanted a Mustang, so I convinced her to go look at one, so she fell in love with a v-6 convertible..she told me that and I told her that I'd disown her and my father if she came home with a V-6 pony car and convinced her to just test drive the GT. Well needless to say she has a GT convertible..she's had great luck with hers which benefited me since I'm still in College and mom and Dad still cover my insurance costs. And I decided to look into getting a Mustang found a used one in my price range...so here is my experiances with mine I've only had a few weeks but WOW this car is Fun!
Since I'm driving A Bright Red (I mean Bright) Mustang GT, you wouldn't believe all the heads that turn. I'm not sure if it is the Deep Growl that bellows out the stainless steel pipes or if it is the Almost blinding red. so far everything is great only thing I've noticed is the AC vents all seem to be busted but I'm having warantee fix that tomorrow.  The car Handles great, you can pass people easily almost no matter what they drive.  I've had a few camaro boys try me and yes the camaro might be a little faster, but I've beaten as many as I've lost, (so either some drivers can't handle their Z's or Z's really arn't all that great) and well to me the Mustang is alot better looking. The GT seats are comfortable (front) the back seats are however used for cruel and unusual punishment for the friends that are smart asses. Trunk space is fine for me the opening is a tad small but I'm over it. Bottom line I'd recommend this car for anyone even if you have small children, they'll like it cuz the seats seem to be made just for them. Heck my mother is getting close to the 50 mark and her and my dad love hers. For those other younger people trying to convince your parents to let you get one it helps if your parents have one already.

also  when i do venture back to my parents house the Drive way looks impressive with her Black convertible and my Red coupe sitting side by side. with both pairs of stainless steel pipes poking out the bumpers.

Oh one last thing opt for the Mach 460 stereo it is Amazing never heard a factory system so good, way better than friends old Bose/monsoon systems
