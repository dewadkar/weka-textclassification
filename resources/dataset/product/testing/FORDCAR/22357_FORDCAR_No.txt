            What a terrible vehicle for such a price.  This vehicle had nothing, but flaws and defects. It came delivered with dry ball joints, a twisted brake line, defective door gaskets, a bad door latch, rattles in the dashboard.  It was in the shop more times than not and the service department could never fix it right.  They were only good at making excuses for it.  Then of course, the truck gained a terrible vibration at 46K miles that couldn't be resolved, either.  The tranny became noisy at 10K miles. 

The 4.6L motor is truly an embarassment, significantly underpowered.  This vehicle couldn't even climb some highway inclines without downshifting and significantly winding out the engine.  

Who would ever have thought that someday one would have to pay $30K or more for a Ford!   <br><br>
