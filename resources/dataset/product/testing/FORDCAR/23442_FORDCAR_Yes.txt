            I recently bought a 2000 Ford Taurus after a rather laboriouos process of trying to decide what kind of car I wanted.  First I went looking on the internet.  There is a great survey given on the compuserve web page that asks you about your price range, accessories wanted, etc and then spits out a list cars that fit the bill.  Unfortunately, I had a very open mind about the car that I wanted so the list it gave me was pretty large.

First I looked at the Nissan Altima, then the Pontiac Grand Am, after that the Ford Taurus, then the Dodge Stratus, the Chrystler Cirrus, Honda Civic, Toyota Camry, and the new Saturn L-Series.  Too many cars to choose from....and with every car I looked at I was finding more and more accessories that I wanted.  At first, I just wanted a very basic car, ya know maybe power windows and some good AC, but nothing special.  However, after looking at all these cars I wanted a sun roof, leather interior, 6CD changer, etc.  So there is a downfall of just going out and looking at a bunch of cars....it's probably better to only have a few cars in mind, especially if you are on a tight budget.

Anyways, I decided on the Ford Taurus.  Why? because I could get everything that I wanted and at a decent price.  Also, they were running a special so the leather interior was free :)

Seriously though the Taurus is just an all around great car.  When I test drove the Taurus I could actually feel the difference between that and the other cars I had test drove (I have to admit the Honda Civic felt incredible to drive too).  The Taurus seemed to have great control and lots of pep.  I have had the car for two months now and I love it.  My father actually just went out and bought a used 1999 Taurus because the car he was driving broke down and he loved my new car so much.

Also, the Taurus is a very comfortable and roomy car.  The trunk is very spacious and there is lots of leg room for the front and back passengers.  The driver's seat is adjustable in 8 different directions and the car offers an option that gives extra lumbar support.  

There are a couple of things to think about when deciding what kind of Taurus to get.  The car that I have has a larger engine than the standard model, it obviously costs more, but supposedly adds a little to the life of the engine and increases the gas mileage....a big concern nowadays.

So if you are thinking about buying a new car I highly recommend the Ford Taurus...however I also recommend checking out a number of cars...but not too many.  Good luck      <br><br>
