            We bought our Ford Windstar GL because of the good things said about it - the minivan that drives like a car - and because in general, I trust Fords.  With three younger kids, it also gives us a lot of room to pack up and go.  However, the experience we've had with this one has us re-thinking our choice.  It is now in the shop for the fifth time since buying it a little over a year ago, and I wish the problems were more minor.

I do not feel it would be fair to only say negative things about this vehicle, as there are many good things too.  For example, it does drive like a car, and should, being built on a car platform.  We intentionally got one with the bigger V6 for the acceleration power, which it does very well.  The heating and cooling does a great job.  Seating is very comfortable and visibility is good.  Also of importance, it looks nice.

Having to take the van to the shop has been a major pain.  Two of the three kids have car seats, so those have to be removed each time.  Then there is loading everyone up, driving two vehicles to the dealer's service garage, leaving it, and driving home.  Picking it up is the reverse of this procedure - another pain.

Now to the details.  The biggest problem is the transmission.  The first time we took it in, they couldn't find the problem.  The next time they found a problem and supposedly fixed it by re-building part of the transmission.  The third time (every time with the same symptoms), they were short-handed and we picked it up after a week without anyone looking at it.  This last time, they have also supposedly fixed the problem, but the jury's still out.  Other things fixed:  something on the front-left suspension had to be welded back together, the steering rack and pinion mounting came loose, and the tape player quit working.  Luckily, these have been fixed under warrantee, but that is about to expire and I am left wondering what will break after it does.

We bought this Windstar used from a dealer, who had title to it for their own use, with 20k miles.  I don't know if they were rough on it to cause these problems or if it's just one of those vehicles that always seems to have problems, but I don't think it's typical of all Windstars.<br><br>
