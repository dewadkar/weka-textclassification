            we just passed 170,000 miles and the car is still going.  Unfortunately our family is not made of small people and this car is a tight squeeze, especially in the back seat and behind the wheel.  Ours is a 1990 and living in the snow belt of the north it has some rust (the hatch back stopped working over 5 years ago and we have had to replace the back left door for similar reasons.)
The upholstery has held up better than I could have ever expected the seats show little signs of wear.
We get great gas mileage, and have hardly ever been in the shop.  The only thing is that for the last year or so every time we fill up the gas tank we also have to add two quarts of oil.  There is no oil leak, but we don't know where it is all going.
It is a reliable car, but it is more man friendly than woman friendly.  I find that the steering wheel is positioned too low for a person to sit with their legs together (woman) and it is not natural for a woman to sit with their legs apart to drive a car.<br><br>
