            There was a time when we owned a real clunker of a car, and in order to visit our relatives, 7 hours away, we could either rent a car or replace the parts that broke on our clunker after a long trip.  We usually rented a car.  On one occasion, we got upgraded to a 1997 Thunderbird LX.

The particular T-Bird we received had one of Ford's &quot;color-change&quot; paintjobs.  In one light it was a deep green, and from a different angle it would appear dark violet.  Not all of Ford's &quot;color-change&quot; paints work, but this instance was fairly sharp, especially on the low-slung Thunderbird, which supports dark colors well.

On first impression, the T-Bird's 3.8-liter V-6 was sluggish and unresponsive.  I'd find myself standing on the gas pedal and wondering why nothing was happening.  Then I'd look at the speedometer and see the needle rocketing towards 90 mph.  That's the kind of performance this T-Bird exhibits:  Sneak-up-on-you-and-wallop-you-from-behind acceleration, with no noise, no fuss, no worry.  Press the pedal, go 70.  On the freeway, this car simply <i>ate</i> the miles up.  At a 75 mph cruise, plenty of passing power was available, and the car never felt anything but rock solid.

And solid is the way this big coupe handled, as well.  My mother-in-law went rocketing at a blind 25 mph curve at 60 mph, scaring the bejeebers out of my wife and I, and the car simply drove around it.  This is a large car that handles much smaller than it is, on the road.

For the drive home, I explored the cargo capacity of this car.  I loaded boxes in the trunk, a mountain bike ON the trunk, a chest of drawers in the back seat, and two kitchen chairs in the back and front seats.  Word to the wise:  If you're hauling a mountain bike on a trunk carrier, at 75mph, <b>make sure</b> your bunjee cords are new and strong.  There are few things to make your heart stop like looking in the mirror and seeing your $400 Cannondale horizontal to the road and flapping in the breeze -- clinging to the bike rack by its fingernails.  The upshot is that I took the wheels off the bike, and it fit in the trunk, <i>with the boxes already in there!</i>

On the downside, I found the seats to be too narrow for my 5'10&quot;, 170lb. (at that time) frame, and my back hurt mightily after a 7-hour drive.  Also, there was no setting on the climate controls that allowed un-conditioned fresh air into the car.  I could either have a window open, or have the AC on.  Or the heat, but it was 88 degrees outside already.

But, for a pure freeway machine, I haven't driven many that did it as well as the Thunderbird LX<br><br>
