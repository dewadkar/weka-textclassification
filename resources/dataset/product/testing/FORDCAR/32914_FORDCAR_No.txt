            I had in my head, a great review for the <b>2000 Ford Ranger</b> and then tires were recalled.  That alone made me want to return my truck.  Then to top it all off, I open up the newspaper and lo and behold, <b>ANOTHER RECALL</b>.  This time it's the seat belts.  This leaves me with the thought, <i>&quot;what next?&quot;</i>  I feel like I'm driving a time bomb, ready to go off.
 
 I will share my thoughts and feelings about the <b> 2000 Ford Ranger</b>  recalls aside, but I really needed to let you know how the recent recalls have affected my opinion on my vehicle.  I will never buy another Ford, ever again.
 
 <b>The 2000 Ford Ranger</b> is a sporty truck with power.  I had previously owned a <b>92 Ford Ranger</b>, but with the 2000 model, Ford had jazzed it up a bit.  It's an awesome truck for someone who wants to have the ability to haul with a pick-up truck, and the easy handling of a car.
 
 <b>What I like about my 2000 Ford Ranger:</b>
They made the hood look more like a Dodge Ram.  I think this gives the truck the illusion that it is actually bigger than it is.
 The handling is sweet.  The truck almost steers itself.  You feel as if yo are just guiding the truck in the general direction and it is doing 
 the rest itself.
 The cab is roomy.  We have the extended cab but I noticed they had actually widened the cab from the previous 92 Ranger that I had owned.
 I love how powerful the engine is.  It accelerates so quickly and smoothly.  It doesn't feel at all like a truck.  
 
 
 <b>What I dislike about my Ford Ranger:</b>
 Well, aside from the fact that my tire could blow at any minute and my seat belt might fail, I really don't dislike my truck.  Major tongue in cheek here.  I do LOVE my truck.  I don't the problems I've had with the tires and now the seat belt so because of that, it makes me wish I had not purchased this vehicle.  This is something I strongly dislike about my Ford Ranger.  Honestly, if it weren't for these recalls I'd have nothing to put here.  The truck is beautiful and handles like a dream.  It runs well, and gets decent gas mileage, crud from Ford anymore.<br><br>
