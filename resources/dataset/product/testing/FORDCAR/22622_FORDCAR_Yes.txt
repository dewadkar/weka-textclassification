            My wife and I purchased our '87 Aerostar LX in 1989 as our family of two was outgrowing a Sentra. We still enjoy the car - even with its 175+k miles. The only serious problem we have had was with the transmission which gave up in the first 6 months we owned it. A poor rebuild required a replacement when a keeper failed inside. At that time, the only major work performed on the engine to this date was accomplished - the heads were removed and de-scaled, new gaskets and head bolts installed. No other work was done on the engine. This van has traveled to California and Montana hauling a trailer suitable for the 4 of us and has made too numerous trips to the grocery store and whatever shops. Since we have put all but about 30,000 miles on it, I would say we have had a tremendous opportunity to detect all the faults that may have been present, and the only one we have found worth mentioning was the early model automatic transmission. One thing my wife enjoyed about driving our Aerostar was that it drove so much like a car! It is maneuverable in tight spots, predictable in its handling  and, even after 17 years of minimum upkeep, is still dependable. My wife, daughters and myself wish the Aerostar were still in production. The Windstar cannot its towing capabilities and the E-series vans are too large for us to feel comfortable in. This van has been used for deliveries for the last 3 years on weekends and still takes us to dinners, gatherings  and the usual &quot;Mom's Taxi&quot; destinations.<br><br>
