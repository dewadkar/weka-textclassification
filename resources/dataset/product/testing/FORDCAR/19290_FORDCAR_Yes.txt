            A year ago, my boyfriend got this crazy notion that my car looked better imbedded in the back end of a pick-up truck.  My car was totalled.  I was the only one injured.  While I was in the ER, he told me that he would get me a new car, but that I had to pick something &quot;safe&quot;.  (Like the old POS I had wasn't or something....!)  So, 4 days later, neck brace and all, I went car shopping.  We tried out (and I actually drove) 12 different cars from 5 different lots.  We drove 2 Contours - the only duplicate model.  The first one was a manual transmission - I could not get the car to go into reverse, because of the lift and shift thing you must do.  But he drove it, and liked it.  I had had a 97 as a rental car once upon a time and knew I liked them then.  We found one right here in town about 3 days later.  This one was an automatic transmission.  This is the one that I got.  It was high miles (salesperson's car), but even at 96000, it is still going strong.  I have put 20000 on it in the last year.  I do animal rescue, and do a lot of driving with that.  I also have a 4 year old who has a lot of activities.  This car has gone from WI to TX and back - twice.  We have had NO problems with the car.  We have fufilled all the recall requirements to date.  If given the choice, when we car shop again, I would look into another Contour.  If handled correctly and maintained well, any car will serve you well... but this one has exceeded our initial expectations.<br><br>
