            I had been looking to buy a new car for quite sometime now.  After much research, I went to the local Ford dealer and test drove the new Escape!  That was all it took!  I fell in love with this vehicle.  Not only is it very eye-catching and stylish, the ride was quite smooth.  The Escape comes with power windows etc. and much more standard equipment than almost any other small SUV.  The stereo system sounds great too! Needless to say, I ended up buying the same Escape that I test drove!  I bought the Escape XLS-4WD.  I have a number of options on the vehicle(perimeter alarm, am/fm stereo cd & cassette).  Driving the Escape feels just like driving a car!  I was rather surprised.  The Escape gives you  a very smooth ride and I blew past just about any vehicle on the highway without any problems.  The V6 engine with 200 "horses" is very fast and able.  The only bad thing that I have found is the gas mileage.  I do not believe that Ford has given accurate numbers for the MPG.  I have to fill up often and with gas prices up I am not too happy about this.  However, I am sure this problem is not unique to the Escape.
