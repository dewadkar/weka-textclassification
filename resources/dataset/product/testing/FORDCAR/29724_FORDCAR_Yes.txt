            The Ford bronco has recieved a bad reputation. Forever in my mind it will be viewed as the white getaway car of the infamous &quot;OJ&quot; Simpson. My father has this car, it is an Eddie bauer, and i love it to death. The only problem is that it has a bad ride due to its old age. Some of the plastic parts on the inside creak just a little bit, and the sound system was weak when he first got it so he then upgraded to a louder kenwood system with two twelve inch speakers, tweeters, and subwoofers. The car is a lot of fun to drive even though it is old and my dad has put alot of miles on it due to his trips to Florida. The only other problem i have with the car is that it burns alot of gas and it has a big gas tank so that means that you spend alot of money and you dont get what you pay for exactly. The truck is a nice ride and something that I suggest you look at or go for a test drive in one at a used car lot due to the fact that they stopped making it to bring in the new bigger Expedition. Although the Expedition is larger the third seat Ford put in it is a joke compared to that of the Chevy Suburban.<br><br>
