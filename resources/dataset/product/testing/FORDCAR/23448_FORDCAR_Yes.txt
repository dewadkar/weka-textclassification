                The 2000 Ford Taurus, is one of this years safest cars. It has plenty of features that are designed to keep you and your family asfe while on the road. 

<b>Interior/Ride/Handling:</b>
   The 2000 Ford Taurus handels fairly well for a mid-size sedan. The ride is much quieter and more smoother in this years model because of the additional sound insulation, and the new refined suspension. The higher roof also makes for easier airflow, which also reduces wind noise. The Interior is comfortable in the front and suitable for kids in the back. There is more headroom then the previous model.You can either get two front bucket seats or a front split bench seat. This year Ford added one more foot to the trunk space, which gives you more space for all your stuff.

<b>Engine/Specs:</b>
   The all new powerplant in the Ford Taurus is what is most surprising. The 3.0-liter Vulcan V-6 has been retuned to increase horsepower by 10 to 155bhp at 4800rpm. Torque is up 15lb-ft to 185 at 3950rpm. the DOHC 24-valve Duratec 3.0liter also has a higher output. than last years. 200lb-ft of torque at 4400, and 200bhp at 5650rpm, it's also thirty pounds lighter. the front disc/rea drum brakes and are competant with additional ABS. The station wagon comes with four wheel disc brakes.

<b>Cliche:</b>
    The all new redesigned 2000 Ford Taurus really surprised me. It gave me a new look on Ford's capability to produce an affective mid-size sedan, in a market where Camry and Accord are chewing up everybody. This car is new so its hard to tell if there will be any up-coming problems with this car. If you are in the market for a mid-size sedan that can take a beating, I would strongly take a look at the new 2000 Ford Taurus.<br><br>
