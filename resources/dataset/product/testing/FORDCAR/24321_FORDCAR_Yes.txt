            I inherited my '94 Escort from my mom, who bought it used with about 53,000 miles on it.  Having a career that requires her to drive a lot, the car had acquired about another 70,000-75,000 miles.  I've since put on a few thousand, myself.  Just before I got it from my mom, she had a near-accident which caused her to veer off the road onto an almost non-existent shoulder, causing a hubcap to fall off and the back passenger-side wheel hasn't been totally steady since.  I've owned it for the last two years, and have only needed to change the oil, get one belt replaced, and put in another fuse for the interior lights (the fuse was included with the vehicle).  I drive a little too fast for my own good, and I love curves WAY too much, so I'm kind of mean to my car.  But it's been good to me.  The acceleration's not the greatest, but it's there in a pinch if you really press it.  The newer Escorts have a little more pickup, as most of my friends have varying years of the same model.  I like the stereo, it's a good system, especially for a compact.  I also like the automatic seat belt mechanism, although it can take some getting used to at first.  It's also very versatile, because of it's size, I can manuveur in most places other cars can't.  I don't like the fact it hardly has power anything, like no power locks or cruise.  But for as much as I've abused it, it's a pretty good car for a student or someone who doesn't need to take long trips.  If cross-country driving is your thing, though, I suggest checking out a Cadillac--well worth the money.<br><br>
