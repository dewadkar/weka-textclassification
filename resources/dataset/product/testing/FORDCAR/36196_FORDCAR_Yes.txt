            This was not the car I really wanted, but now that I've had my Focus SE-Sony Limited Edition for 2 weeks, I can't imagine making a better decision with another car.  I wanted the New Beetle Turbo, but couldn't get financed.  A friend worked at a Ford dealership and told me to think about the Focus.  We talked back and forth for a week, and decided on my Pitch Black SE with dark charcoal leather interior..........  I didn't see it or drive it until I picked it up and the fit and finish just floored me.  I had traded in a 1989 Taurus SHO and couldn't believe that after ALL the problems I had had with the SHO, that I was buying ANOTHER Ford.  When they opened the door and I saw the interior I was shocked.......and really pleased and surprised.  It has a 5-speed Zetec with all the bells and whistles AND the Sony stereo that is scary, it's sooo powerful.  I could go on and on........which I have.  I hope everyone looking at similar sedans will consider this car.  I love the fact that the front doesn't look like any other car on the road........yet.<br>
