            Many people purchase Escorts because of the low cost. This is a large part of the reason I bought my Escort. However, I did not expect to get a lot of mileage out of it due to the amount I paid for the car. The car now has close to 100,000 miles and the only pressing problem is a bad ground cable which costs about 5 dollars. 

The only repairs I had to make on the car was a new celluoid which cost 12 dollars and some belt which cost 10 dollars. Oh, and a washer which cost 50 cents. 

The gas mileage this car gets is awesome. It is close to 300  miles to the tank. However, the car does not have a lot of power. It has the necessary power but no extras.

I would recommend and escort to any looking for a first car or a second car.<br><br>
