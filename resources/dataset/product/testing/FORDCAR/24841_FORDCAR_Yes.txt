This letter clarifies my experience with Ford regarding my purchase of a 2000 Mustang GT, 5 speed (VIN# 1FAFP42X9YF154566).  It has been forwarded to Ford Canada, Advantage Ford in Calgary, Alberta (where the vehicle was purchased), Marlborough Ford in Calgary, Alberta (where the car was serviced), the Consumer Report Online Forum, as well as the internet newsgroups.

In February of this year my wife and I purchased a 2000 Mustang GT from Advantage Ford, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  The salesmen were great.  They answered all our questions, and explained the car fully.  After the sale, the experience on this car slowly spiraled downward.  When we purchased our GM vehicle, the salesman, as well as the business manager, called me once a week for a month to ensure I was absolutely satisfied with our purchase.  I think we may have received a single call from our salesman at Ford.

When we went to pick the car up, they had forgot to tint the windows, as per the deal.  Even though it was pre-paid, I had to go out of my way to take the car to the tint shop to have it done.  

The car itself is very sharp looking.  The body is sound, the exterior construction is top notch.  The doors don't rattle when slammed, and we were very impressed.  The 4.6 liter engine has a lot of power in the upper RPM ranges, but is quite gutless at the lower RPM's.  Any shifts that aren't made very high in the RPM band, place the engine in a band that it has very little power.  The transmission isn't bad, but my 1967 Corvette had a way better gearbox.  The solid rear axle causes the back of the vehicle to side-skip dangerously if a the tires hit a break in the pavement on a corner.  This occurs even at slow speed.  The steering wheel lock is only on 180 degree intervals.  What good is that?  If you do get the wheel to lock when the rack and pinion is hot, it's almost impossible to remove the pressure from the ignition tumbler when the rack and pinion is cold.  My wife's 1989 Mustang GT had the same problem.  The interior of the car offers little to be desired.  The leather upgrade only affects the front buckets.  The back seat is covered in vinyl.  The front buckets are very uncomfortable to sit in.  They have no lumbar and no heat.  Long journeys in this car are almost painful.  In the winter, the car feels drafty and cold.  Turning up the blower fixes the heat problem, you just can't hear yourself think over roar of the blower.  The blower on low speeds has a very annoying squeak.  My friends 1995 Mustang GT coupe has the same annoying squeak.  Five years, and the problem is still there!  The interior is cheap grade plastic.  Many areas on the car have pieces of plastic extrusion that still weren't cleaned off before the car was assembled.  The map pockets on the doors have sharp plastic edges, and no inserts to make them look finished.  The whole interior probably cost Ford $50 to build.

All bitching aside, the car itself was a welcome addition to our family, until the problems started:
- At 5500 km, the transmission exhibited a problem where changing from reverse to first gear caused the transmission to lock up.  Disengaging the clutch caused grinding of gears.  After working the gear shift for about fifteen minutes, the transmission would free itself.  After complaining to the service manager at Marlborough Ford, he agreed to swap the transmission (as there was a TSB on this problem).  
- At 9000 km it developed an exhaust leak.
- At 12000 km it started to randomly stall when coasting to a light.  It went into the shop, and they found the low speed cooling fan wasn't connected, and they suspected the load from the high speed fan was stalling the engine.
- Returned to the shop because it continued to stall.  No fault found.
- Returned to Advantage Ford, where they re-programmed the ECU to eliminate the stalling problem.  It hasn't stalled as of yet, but the weather has changed.
- At 12500 km returned to the shop for a thumping noise in the transmission when changing gears.  I'm told this horrible sound is &quot;normal&quot;.
- Returned the next day for a seizing release bearing in the clutch assembly.  The whole clutch was replaced at this point.
- Still waiting on the re-call for the parking brake.  No big deal; the car really doesn't need to stop.

The service at Marlborough Ford was great.  They were tired of seeing me, but they always treated me with respect.  My only complaint was they lack the extra little care.  Not once did the car come from the shop clean.  When our GM product came from the shop, it had been washed.  In the land of Ford, the policy is &quot;Dirty in, Dirty out&quot;.  Upset with the problems this car has caused us, I called the Ford Customer Care Center.  It took four (4) calls to the center over a period of eight (8) days to actually get an answer about the car.  I finally got to speak to someone who would give me an answer, and the answer was &quot;Ford sells the car to the dealer, the dealer sells to the consumer.  Ford will do nothing for you, as it is between the dealer and you.&quot;  Thanks Ford!  Your product is substandard, your customer care is substandard, and your attitude towards the consumer is substandard.  I've yet to receive a survey regarding the service done at Marlborough Ford.  Ford, aren't you supposed to follow up on work done for your customers?

Leaving me with no options, I returned to Advantage Ford to see what they could do for me.  I was basically told all the problems from the car stemmed from the initial transmission swap by Marlborough Ford.  They were prepared to do nothing but continue to try to bring my level of confidence up on the car.  Once a lemon, always a lemon in my books.

So to summarize:
- Don't bother calling for Customer Care.  They will do nothing for you.  They don't care at all.  They really should change their number from 1-800-565-FORD to 1-800-FORD-SUX.
- As much as the initial sale at Advantage Ford was great, they don't stand behind their product.  They were more willing to pass the buck than look after my needs.
- The service at Marlborough Ford was great.  But, according to Advantage Ford, their mechanics were negligent in repairing my vehicle.  You be the judge.












So, after losing all confidence in the car (this was my wife's car), we decided to trade it on an Acura CL Type S.  This will be the last blue oval that will be parked in my garage.  So here is an estimated summary in what this car has cost me:

$10000		Lost due to depreciation on the trade.
-$2500 		Usage for the 13000 km on the vehicle, as per CAMVAP calculations.
$50 		Missed time at work to take care of the window tinting (which was part of the deal).
$50 		Gas burnt while the car was in the shop (75 litres @ $0.65 / litre).
$170 		Missed day of work for my wife when the transmission piled up in the back-alley.
$200 		Cumulative missed time at work for me to deal with the car in the shop.

Total:  $7970.  

So Ford, when can I expect my check in the mail?  &quot;Ford Quality is Job One&quot;.  I doubt it.  If this is the quality level of your service and product, then I guess I was the fool for buying your product.
