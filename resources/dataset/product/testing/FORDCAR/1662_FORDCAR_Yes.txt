            We just purchased a &quot;00&quot; Ford Excursion XLT.  Got a great deal too.  We pull a travel trailer, and have done so with a Dodge Durango. The durango had the guts to do it, but just did not carry through, plus, our luck with Dodges just isn't good at all. I guess we have always had bad luck with Chrysler/Dodge products.  

During a 4 day weekend camping trip, we wanted to look around.  We had been looking at the Suburbans, but just couldn't get a price we could live with.

We checked out the Excursion, and ended up buying it.  1) For the price, 2) size and 3) room, plus 4) it could pull a train up hill, well almost.

What we like about it is the interior room. Its built on an F-250 frame and we feel like it can handle what we need. No we don't go off-road either, just simple camping trips to state parks and RV resorts.

Although we haven't had it long, we pulled it back to South Texas (Corpus Christi Area) from the Texas Hill Country. We had a 25 mile per hour South-South West wind and even with that, while pulling a travel trailer, we got almost 12 mpg.   (5.4 L engine with tow package).  We wish the gas mileage would be better, but we went into this knowing, based on its size and what we towed, it probably wouldn't get that good, much any better.  By its self, on the road, we get 16 mpg.

Overall, and so far, we are very happy with it.  The ride is comfortable, its quite and roomy and high enough off the ground that we can actually see the top of the tires of big trucks that pass us, or that we pass (ha ha)

If you want room, if you want comfort, if you want towing capacity, go with the Excursion. If you just want to drive around town, get into and out of tight parking spots, this may not be for you.  For us, it is what we want all the way around. <br><br>
