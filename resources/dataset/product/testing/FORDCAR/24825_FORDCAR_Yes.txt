            My story begins on October 23, 1999. After a good 3 months of waiting, my baby finally came in. On this fine date I drove my first new car off the lot. <b>This truly is a great car</b>.  Smooth ride, TONS of power, and looks to die for. By the way, this is my daily car (driven to work each day) - I drive it about 120 miles a day 5 days a week. It has such an amazing feel of power.  My new favorite thing to do is Drifting.   Basically, when I'm in a turn I downshift a gear and punch it.  I got a video of myself driving my Mustang side ways for 4 seconds. It's great fun, but don't get caught! :-)  

By the way, I was also suprised how comfortable the interior was too. I'm just shocked about all these people posting how the interior isn't that good, this is not the case.  I think alot of people are expecting too much in terms of interior quality.  As for reliability, my Mustang has been fantastic/bullet proof! In 12 months I put 55,000 miles on it - and it's still running like new!  The paint is still new, there are no sqeaks, no rattles, nothing wrong.  By the way, this beautiful car was much more affordable than I originally thought. The dealer gave me a good deal and I also got a College grad instant rebate. The people at Ford were the only Car Company that didn't treat me like a kid. Most of these places wanted me to be a homeowner or have 5-10 years of established credit. Ford Credit Company left a good taste in my mouth.   Way to go Ford!

<b>More Pros:</b>

<b>*</b> A Legend... people will KNOW what kind of car you drive just by a glance.
<b>*</b> Sweet sounding engine through those awesome dual exhausts.
