            This is one of the biggest friggin Pickup trucks I have ever owned.. try getting in to a regular parking space with this monster.  I always have to park way back where I dont have to manuever around cars. I mean i mine as well buy a tractor trailer.  Other than that this thing is great.  Got your extended cab with 4 fully functioning doors and a huge bed.  I have carried so many huge things in that bed I cant rembmer them all.. It is quite an experience owning the biggest truck in the neighborhood.. I feel like a tru hill billy when driving this monster hehe. I would most likely recommend this to someone who doesn't care that you cant fit in to regular parking spots.  <br><br>
