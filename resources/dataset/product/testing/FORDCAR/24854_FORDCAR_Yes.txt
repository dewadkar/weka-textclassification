              I recently purchased a laser red mustang convertible.  I always dreamed of owning a mustang ever since I could remember.  When I finally drove the car off the lot I was not disappointed.  The car was just as perfect as I could ever hope for.  The power that the 3.8L is very impressive.  The 190hp is more than enough to lay you back in the seat.  I couldn't even image what I would do with the 70 extra that come with the GT, but I'm sure it would be a lot of fun finding out.  

  The mustang v6 out performs the camaro's v6 in both 0-60 and 1/4 mile times.  The car drivers like a dream.  The car handles small bumps with grace...but there is no mistaking that it is a sports car.  The black leather seats are very comfortable up front, and the back...well its a sports car...enough said. This baby turns heads every stop light and fill up.  Surprisingly since more than 110,000 mustangs were sold for 2000, which is twice as many the GM rivals combined.  

  The looks of the mustang are a much sharper and muscular look than the 94-98 styles.  You can tell that this is a real pony car. The fit and finish of this mustang is much more refined than those of the past.  Quality is definitely Job 1 at Ford.  .  If you want a piece of american automotive history, then buy a mustang.  The camaro isn't even made in the USA anymore, its built in canada.  Buy a mustang, and every time you drive it you will have a smile on your face.<br><br>
