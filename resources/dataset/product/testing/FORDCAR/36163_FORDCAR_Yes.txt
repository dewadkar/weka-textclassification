                 I did not enter the Ford Dealership in October, 1999, looking for the Ford Focus.  It had only recently arrived onto the showroom.  My saleslady was too busy helping another customer and I happened to be sitting next to a Ford Focus and another Ford car.  The car was a beautiful silver which immediately caught my eye.  Once I opened the door, I fell in love with the interior room and panel controls.  I climbed into the car and was very impressed with the arm and leg room in such a small car.  One I climbed into the back seat and saw the room, I knew this was the car for me!

    My saleslady finally came over and attempted to see me a less expensive Escort or a more expensive Taurus with a $2,000 rebate on either car.   I told her, &quot;No way!&quot;  It was the best decision that I could ever make.  The car has given me no problems and it is exactly what I need.  I can only offer praise for the car.  

     The only trouble that I have ever had was the car trying to swerve slightly when I was on the freeway crossing a high bridge on a windy day.  Once I cut my speed by about 5 mph all was back to normal.  Ford you have done it!  <br><br>
