                 You rarely hear of a truck being considered a family vehicle but I use mine in that capacity. I bought a 1997 Ford F-150 extended cab Lariat edition. It has plenty of room in the back for small children. I have a son who is six and a daughter who is two months. There is room for both of them and bags of groceries. It can also sit small adults well but the leg room in the back is very limited. The back seats also are not padded well and would not be recommended for adults on long trips.      The Lariat comes with cruise; power door, windows, seat (drivers), and mirrors. The floor is carpeted, but we put in plastic floor mats when we go to my parents farm. It is great for limited hauling and off road riding. On road it has a smooth ride but more noise than you may be used to in a car priced in the same range. <br><br><br>
