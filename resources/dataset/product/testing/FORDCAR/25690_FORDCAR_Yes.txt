            I have recently become the owner of a 2001 Ford Taurus.  I did not expect that I would ever be Taurus owner as this was a model that I was not even considering.  Until recently I was a Saturn owner.  The Saturn was still driving acceptably but I knew that it was a matter of time until maintenance and upkeep were going to increase.  So...I started shopping for a new car.

I originally started looking for another Saturn.  My other "Make" options were Honda, Toyota and VW.  After some research I realized that most of these brands were priced higher than I was willing to pay.  I ended up at my local Ford dealership only as a result of advertising for 0% financing.  I was only looking when I got hooked on the Taurus.

The car itself is loaded with options.  My car is the <b> SES <b> model and had the following features:  6 cylinder engine, A/C, Security System, 6 CD changer, premium sound system (which sounds better than any system I have ever had!), wood trim, tinted windows, alloy wheels, front and side air bag protection, steel cage construction, front crumple zones and engine dropdown (in the event of a head on collision), trunk release safety feature, child proof rear door locks, power windows/locks, traction control system, power moon roof. Oh and did I mention the adjustable brake/gas pedals?  (very nice feature!)
I am exhausted just listing the options.  All of this comes in a car that you can purchase for just over $20K.  I was partially sold after I realized all the features this car has and the relatively economical price.  I was completely sold when I test drove this car.  It has the feel of a much larger car;  roomy, comforting interior, minimal road noise, smooth ride, maximum head room, excellent visibility

Once I got the car home, I parked it in the garage and panicked.  What had I done?  Did I really need to buy a new car in today's economy?  After taking the car out and driving it a few days, my answer was a resounding "YES!"  I love this car and the comfort is provides as well as excellent styling.  I do not think I will come to regret this purchase.

A sidenote:  I was also very pleased with my new insurance premium.  This car is highly rated as a very safe vehicle.  My premiums were not much more than my 4 cylinder Saturn.  Insurance is something to think about when making a new purchase, too!

I recommend this car to families (excellent child safety features) and mature "singletons".  The "bang for the buck" is definitely present.  Younger 20-somethings may not be impressed with the less trendy styling or 4 doors.

Overall, I have to say that I would buy another Ford product again and will probably look at the Taurus in 5 years.
