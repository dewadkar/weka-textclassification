            I started looking for a car last year (2002). I was  looking for a sporty car with good looks and decent performance. I limited my search to vehicles under $25K, which left many options. I drove the Mitsubishi Eclipse (great style, poor visibility and power), Suburu WRX (boring looks, great power but pricey), Honda Accord (not exactly a sports car, but too expensive), Nissan Sentra Spec V (poor styling, good power but has bad torque pull), and the Mustang. I also looked online at the Hyundai Tiburon, Toyota Celica, and some GM cars.

The Mustang won me over on the styling and ergonomics. Even though it is a sports car, the visibility is good, and interior space is great (well, the front seats). I am 5'11" and slender, so I don't have a problem in most cars I drive, but my brother is 6'4" and usually has issues with headroom and legroom. He fits great in this car. 

I drove the V8 GT and loved it, but personally, I didn't see a reason to spend another $6K plus additional insurance. Also, I drive pretty aggressive and probably would lose my license within a week!!

I chose the "laser red" V6 with 5-speed manual transmission. I drove the automatic, but really why an automatic on a sports car? Plus with a smaller engine the manual gives more control and a sportier feel.

I've only had this a week, though it took me 8 months to decide. So far I love it. The 3.8L really gets the car moving. Compared to the GT, yes it is slow. But it outpaces the Eclipse and other numerous Japanese "pocket rockets". I live in a small town, and have yet been able to reach redline in second; I run out of room! That Camero SS next to you may reach the next light a little quicker, but oh, well; I can still beat all the Hondas.

I live in Wisconsin, and the winters can be nasty. This is a rear-wheel drive, and not everyone can deal with that in snow. The manual will make it much easier to control, but if you are afraid of winter driving, pick a front-wheel or even better an all-wheel drive car.

The handling is tight, but rather comfortable over bumps (helped by the 16" wheels). My buddy had a Mercury Cougar that would jar the fillings out of your teeth; this Mustang is rather smooth on the highway. Once you get used to rear-wheel, this car just begs to be tossed around, once again helped by the manual tranny.

The base model is all I could have asked for. At $19,000 it is a great value. Seats are very comfortable, instruments are clear and easy to read, and I really get a kick out of the "old-style" headlight switch...the ol' pull-knob. I am leasing it for about $250/month with no money down. I'm in finances and based on my needs the lease makes the most sense; I'll want to be in another new car in 3 years anyway.

Keep in mind I am 29, male with a wife and two young kids. My other car is a 2000 Ford Windstar, so I have a vehicle for the long drives with family. But we've been comfortable driving around with all four of us and a trunk full of groceries; though I must say when a kid is behind me I need to move my seat up a little, but not bad.

Thanks to all the other epinion users; your comments were helpful deciding on the Mustang versus other sports cars. Realize it is NOT a family vehicle, and you'll do no wrong. If you can afford the GT, go for it; more options and more power. Otherwise, you won't be disappointed with the "base" V6 3.8L. And don't complain about small backseats; it has them and works for kids and short trips with other adults.

UPDATE - November 2003 - After driving the Mustang for seven months, I love it as much as the day I bought it. I took it for a 1,200 mile journey, and it was great! No problems at all. It still turns heads, and the V6 has more than enough power. Still my favorite car that I have driven (at least that I could afford). I have one complaint still, and that is the stock radio is not very good. It is also a double-DIN design, so I can't find a perfect fitting unit; will just have to add a spacer. Just thought I'd give an update for you all.
