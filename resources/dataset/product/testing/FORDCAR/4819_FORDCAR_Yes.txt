            Several years ago I needed a good reliable work vehicle so I went shopping. I came across a 1986 Ford Ranger with a fuel injected V6, 5-speed tranny, with 129,000 miles. I liked it from the moment I laid eyes on it and bought it. I drove that truck for about 4 years and the only thing I did to it was put new shocks and a throttle position sensor on it. A guy I worked with heard me talk about it and offered me a fair price without even seeing it. I took him up on it.

He promptly blew up the motor and had it rebuilt. He blew out the tranny and had it replaced. He is currently putting another tranny in it. Guess some people have good luck and some have bad. In this case I think he just can't drive it.

This past summer a friend of mine and his wife divorced. She had both of their vehicles in her name and wanted to get rid of the 1990 Ranger she had. I told her I would give her what she owed, which was $1300.00 under blue book value and she accepted. It's an 4 cylender (can't have everything I guess), automatic, and had 144,000 miles on it when I got it. My wife drives 76 miles a day to work and back and never had any trouble with it. I now drive it to work and still have no problems. I recently put new front brakes on it and have purchased shocks to put on at a later date. When my buddy had it it seemed like he was fixing something on it weekly. 

I guess this leads me to believe that, once again, some people are lucky with vehicles and some aren't. I've only had one so far that I had problems with and it's the only one I ever bought new.

I like the smaller Rangers because they handle well on the highway and in tight places. I have no need for a vehicle to haul big loads and if I did I have a relative who lives close with a 3/4 ton Ford truck. This 1990 sits comfortable (cloth bucket seats), handles nice and accelerates just fine for a work vehicle. I just wish it had at least a 6 cylender.<br><br>
