            One of the soldiers in my reserve unit has a 1994 Ford Aspire, 2-door, with a manual transmission, and I got to drive the car on an 80-mile round trip last month for a unit errand.  This brought back some memories as back in 1994, living in South Korea where the Aspire was made, I owned the Korean domestic version of this car, known there as the Kia Avella.

Most aspects of the American market car were the same, with the main differences being a lack of airbags on my Korean model, and less luxury equipment on the American model.

Luxury equipment on an Aspire?  You bet!  My Kia Avella had power windows and mirrors, a nice sounding 6-speaker cassette stereo (this was 1994) and very nice cloth on the seats and door trim.  It also had more sound deadening material and proved that with enough insulation, even the smallest cars can provide a VERY quiet ride.  

The American model, in contrast, had a very basic AM/FM radio (since replaced by the car's owner with a decent CD system), crank windows, all plastic door trim and manual mirrors.  The seat cloth was of decent quality, but lacked the softness of the Korean model, and the car was just a lot noisier going down the road, though some of that may be attributable to age.

That was it for the differences.  The Korean model was considerably faster on account of perhaps 200lbs less weight (not making American safety standards does wonders for weight reduction), though the American model, while slow, isn't dangerously slow.  Even with the AC on and three adults in the car, the Aspire had no trouble cruising at 75mph.  Of course, I once took my Korean model from Seoul to Pusan (about 400 miles) with FOUR adults in the car, and with the AC on it had plenty of pep at high speed (120~140KPH).  I drove an automatic model in Korea and I must say that THAT car was dangerously underpowered.  Any way you look at it, this is not a performance car, and even with the 5-speed, plan your passing carefully.

What people buy these cars for, either new or used, is economy.  My car typically returned between 40 and 50MPG, which is simply amazing fuel economy for a gasoline-powered automobile with a four, rather than a three cylinder engine.  The American model returns roughly the same, though maybe one or two MPG worse on account of the higher weight.

Ride is smooth and the interior, while small, is well-designed.  Even in the cheaper-looking US model, there is nothing that makes a driver feel poor about this car.  The dash is nice-looking if simple (my Korean model had a tach, the US model doesn't), and the seats are supportive.  The shifter was probably my favorite aspect of driving this car, as with all Mazda's, is sporty and has excellent feel.  

If you don't know, I'll let you in on a llittle secret, the engine and tranny are made-in-Japan Mazda units, and the same car was sold in Japan as the Mazda 121.  All variants of the car were made in Korea by Kia motor company, which back in 1994 was partially owned by Mazda and Ford.  The Ford Aspire is actually the repacement/evolution of the Ford Festiva, which was sold in Korea as the Kia Pride and in Japan as the (previous generation) Mazda 121.

These cars have an excellent reputation in Korea for mechanical reliability, and while frequently the butt of jokes here in the US, they have proven themselves relaible here as well.  The Aspire is not glamorous, luxurious or even stylish (subjective), but if you are looking for a cheap, reliable used car that will not need much (gas or repairs), this one is hard to beat, just be sure to stay in the slow lane on uphill climbs.

Unlike the Festiva, which was a pretty quick car with this same engine, the Aspire shows the downfalls of marketing the same car in different countries.  The Aspire is a good car, but for the US market it needed more power to cope with the extra weight of US market safety equipment.  Kia introduced a 1.5 liter Avella in 1995 (another Mazda parts-bin engine) that made the Korean-market car something of a pocket rocket.  This engine should have been in the US model from the beginning, and would have, in my opinion, made the difference for the Aspire between a reputation for sluggishness and one of competence.  The Aspire was otherwise so good that it deserved the bigger engine for the US, and shows the dangers of a "world car" when there is no differentiation by country.
