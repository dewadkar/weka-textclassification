            The 95 E150 Ford was my fourth van and second Ford van. It was bought new with a 300ci straight 6 engine.The cargo van came with AC,sliding side door,insulated rubber mat floor, and a passenger bucket seat. I have since added two bucket seats, one bench seat and a side window.

My previous Ford van was a 78 E350 with a 351 V8. The 351 averaged 10-12 mpg. I therefore opted for the 300 6 hoping to increase my mpg significantly. Over the years I have averaged 13-15 city and 16-19 hwy.

The main problems have been with the front brakes and suspension. The first brake job was done at 12000 miles under warranty(without me even asking) Although I have never experienced pulling I have had numerous alignments because of uneven tire wear. I do suspect a weak front suspension system on the 150 model.The '78 350 had no such problems.

The drivetrain has been great and the performance adequate,although I have never towed anything.I had to replace the $70 oil pan gasket with $250 of labor, and the alternator belt slips from puddle splashes. We currently have 75000 miles on this van<br><br>
