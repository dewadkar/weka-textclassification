            I have been waiting for a truck like this for a very long time.  I have wanted a truck that would have enough room to carry my entire family (all six of us, including 3 teenagers) with the styling of a Dodge Ram.  Well, Ford came through with the 1999 F250 Super Duty Crew Cab!  The PowerStroke diesel engine has more than enough towing power for our travel trailer.  We have taken several long road trips (over 500 miles) and the ride was very comfortable.  Only real drawbacks are the low gas mileage (especially with 4x4 and automatic transmission) and the side mirrors (I will be replacing with towing mirrors).<br><br>
