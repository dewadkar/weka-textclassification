            I live in North Carolina and in the past couple of years have become a birder and outdoor enthusiast.  This has led to my driving on a lot of gravel and dirt roads - not really the best place for my '97 Mustang GT, and wanting to go places that the Mustang plain couldn't go.  I didn't need a vehicle that could go out and climb mountains - I wanted something that would be good on the regular roads for 95% of my driving and get decent gas mileage, but that could handle sand, some mud, etc.  The 2002 Ford Escape has turned out to be perfect for the task.

I bought a 2002 Escape XLT Premium 4X4 with leather package, 6 CD in dash changer and side airbags.  (Power sunroof, Power drivers' seat, Power windows and doors, cruise control, towing package for up to 3500 lbs, 4spd automatic transmission, 3.0L 201hp V6, folding rear seats, cargo net, cargo cover, air conditioning, center console with two cupholders and large storage area, storage drawer under the passenger seat, cupholders in the back seat are some of the other features of the XLT Premium, which is the top of the line model.  I did not look at the XLS or XLT Sport and Choice models so cannot compare them.)  The list price for my car was $26,025.

I really like the looks of the Escape - it looks rugged and durable.  I was not interested in a "cutesy" SUV; the thing is half truck for pete's sake.  The grey urethane bumpers and body side cladding are a great touch and I like them much better than the the comparable metallic versions on the Escape's kissing cousin, the Mazda Tribute.

The Escape handles quite well on the road.  The acceleration is decent - not up to the Mustang's standards, but nothing short of a gas guzzling V8 SUV was going to come close to that, and I was not interested in going down that route.  It feels a little "tippy" on highway exit/on ramps if taken at too high a speed, but much less so than Ford Explorers or Chevy Blazers, both of which I have driven for extended periods of time.  Other than that, I have nothing to criticize in the handling.

Although one reviewer has said that the Escape is not meant to go off road, it can do certain things quite well.  He is correct that it is not designed to climb a mountain.  I have, however, had it out on the beach several times and it performs quite well, with never a hint of getting stuck.  I've also had it on dirt roads I would never have taken my Mustang on, again with no problems.  No mud yet, though!  
The only criticisms I have of the Escape so far are in small details.  When I bought it, one of the speakers was not hooked up properly and I had to have it fixed.  This should have been noticed before the car was sold.  (This was handled very well by the dealership, however, about which I have no complaints.)  Also, the front brakes throw off too much debris and discolor the front wheels.  (I have noticed this on other Escapes, not just mine.)  This leaves the rear wheels nice and shiny, and the front wheels dingy.  These are minor nits in what is overall a great vehicle - the favorite one I have ever purchased for myself (its a decent sample size).
