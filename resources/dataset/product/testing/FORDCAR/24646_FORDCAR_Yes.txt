            Two years ago we set out to buy a new van.  We were currently driving a 1987 Ford Aerostar and we were very pleased with it.  It needed about $1500.00 worth of work to put it back into top condition.  We thought about doing that instead of buying a new one and decided we would go ahead and look around some.  

So the test driving and looking began.  We started with Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth Vans.  We drove around 12 of them.  Fell in love with one Chrysler minivan and one Plymouth minivan.  

Next we drove a couple GM mini-vans and were not pleased with them.  Then we went to the Fords.  We drove four Windstars.  Two brand new, two project vehicles (from 100 to 20,000 miles on the vehicle)and we were quite pleased with them also.  

And so over the next two weeks we narrowed our search down to 3 vans.  One new Chrysler, one used Lumina and and one new Windstar.  Price ranges varied from 14,900 to 5500. 

We now had our choice down to two the Chrysler and the Windstar.  We were leaving a shopping mall and as we were getting ready to pull out of the parking lot our granddaughter said, 'Papa, can be stop and see Grandpa Johns tombstone.'  The cemetery where my dad was buried was right across from the parking lot.  So I said 'sure why not.' 

As we turned on to the road and stopped at the stoplight we found ourselves looking at the used car lot in front of us.  As I turned the corner to go to the cemetery we both spotted a beautiful Ford Aerostar Extended cab.  

After visiting the cemetery we drove into the lot and looked closer at the van.  It was used, a 1993, beautiful customized red paint job with decal work.  Running boards, and an excellent price.  We had looked at three other 1993 Aerostars that were priced about 3,000 to 5,000 more than this one and wondered why such a low price.

We had to wait two days for the lot to open.  It was a Saturday afternoon and they closed at noon that day and so we had to wait for Monday.  We went down and asked some questions about the vehicle, they did not take trade ins at all.  They priced all the vehicles to reflect trade ins, and any type of haggling.  So the price you see is the price you pay.  

So we drove it and fell in love with it and have taken it to Memphis, (we live in Iowa) twice to Tulsa, once to Rhode Island and we have made many local (state wide) trips with this van and have had no problems at all.  It rides smoothly, runs smoothly, and is very economical.  We get around 25 to 28 mpg on the road and between 18 to 22 in town.

So for starting out to buy a new van, we bought a used one because of all the vans we drove we liked this one the best.  And money did not play a part in it.  We had the finances for either vehicle.  It was a matter of choice.  This van was simply the best.

So if you are looking for a new van, and really don't mind an older one, I would recommend the 1993-1995 Ford Aerostar Extended Van.  It is an excellent vehicle.<br><br>
