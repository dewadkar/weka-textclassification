            I bought my ford Tempo about two years ago .  Since then it has driven 20,000 miles more or less . I bought this car because I needed a car to commute 50 miles to school in . So after some haggling my father bought me my Ford Tempo GL at a used car lot .    My car has not given me as much trouble as I thought it was going to .  So far I have replaced the alternator , the brakes , the battery and done basic maitanence .  I hope that this car will hold out for another year , but that is not guaranteed , I feel like a ton of things are about to wrong with it .  I recommend this car to commuters on a budget .  I do not recommend this car if you want to pick up chicks ( its not a very attractive car ) . <br><br>
