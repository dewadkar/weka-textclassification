            Went shopping for a Taurus SHO and ended up with the SE with 24OHV engine option.  The SE was identically equipped as far as options, leather etc, and with the 24valve OHC engine, performance was too close to the SHO to warrant the extra cost. There was a time when the SHO was a car to own, no longer.  The only advantage the SHO offered was four wheel disc brakes.

Like most Ford products I have owned (been a Ford man since 1986) the seats are far better suited to my physique (short extra fat) than any other domestic car I have owned.  Six way power option affords unlimited control over your seating position. Long trips (12-14 hours) become a breeze.

The car is well equipped and the option list does not leave you wanting for much.

Overall fit and finish is what you would expect from this class of vehicle, no more, no less.

Performance is not too shabby, although I would like to get hold of the guy that decided the engine should be governed to 118mph.  The engine was pulling strong when I hit the no go zone (4200rpm), and if left to it's own devices would have topped out in the mid to high 120's.  Best power comes in the 50mph range.  Although not bad off the line, most rice burners will give it a good run.  Cruising at 80-90mph is like relaxing in your easy chair.

Split rear seats are great for those extra long items, bungy cords not required.

Gas mileage is the only thing left to be desired.

Only problem in 30,000 miles has been a faulty 'DOOR AJAR' switch,left me driving around with the interior lights on.  Problem occurred on a Saturday morning and I didn't notice the interior light had remained on, consequently, Sunday morning arrived with a flat battery. the dealer had to disconnect the interior lights for four days while they waited for a replacement.<br><br>
