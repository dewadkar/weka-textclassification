            As a sport utility driver, Jeep Cherokee, I had been interested in the Ford Expedition since it was introduced.  Unfortunately for me, I chose the traditionally reliable Toyota 4-Runner.  I will have to admit that the only expenses I had on the 4-Runner in 58000 miles of driving were tires, oil changes, one rear tail light, and gas.  However, the suspension was so stiff that I got to the point that I dreaded to have to drive anywhere.

When I took my son shopping for a new F-150 pickup truck, we noticed a couple of black Expeditions that were very sharp looking.  Since Ford had 3.9% financing, and with my trade, it was very affordable.  I took delivery the next day, and I couldn't be happier.

The Expedition has the small V-8.  Since I don't do any towing, I didn't necessarily feel I needed the larger V-8.   I have averaged around 17 miles per gallon on unleaded 87 Octane gas.  Some of the other large sport utilities require premium fuel.  Check that out before you buy.  The Expedition has a third rear seat which can be removed for more trunk capacity.  The luggage capacity is not very much with all three seats in use.  I can carry all my grandkids, plus their parents!
 
This one has 60 series tires.  It rides almost like a full-sized car, not a truck.  It also handles well for such a large vehicle.  The controls are easy to read and use, especially at night.  They are well lit.  I haven't had a backache since I purchased the Expedition.<br><br>
