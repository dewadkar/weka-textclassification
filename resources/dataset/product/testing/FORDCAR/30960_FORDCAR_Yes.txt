            We had bought a 95 Contour back in 1997.  I loved the look of the car and the way it drove so we bought it.  I had a love hate relationship with this car.  
Within a few months of buying this car I had it in the shop for problems with the brakes.  Luckily my warranty covered it but I thought that was awful fast to have problems with it.  The Ford dealership fixed that problem and then a few more things happened it.  Don't you know my husband who is US Navy was gone for six months and California was in the middle of El Nino and my rear light kept filling up with water and shorting out.  I was going through the light bulbs about 6 a month till they got the parts in that they needed to fix it.  Once that was fixed my rear view mirror fell off.  These problems may have been just that one car but my idea of the Contour was out the window at this point.  
Another draw back to the car was the back seat.  I hadn't realized how small that back seat was. It was fine if you were only going to have children back there but it wasn't comfortable for adults.  There was no leg room.  The front seats on the other hand were real comfortable.  
I can however tell you how well these cars handle in an accident.  Unfortunately the car was totaled.  I was rear ended and then spun under a semi.  The car didn't fare so well but I got out pretty lucky.  Just a lot bruising from the seat belt and my right arm was banged up (I think from the passenger airbag).  The airbags in the Contour are wonderful.  It felt like someone had thrown a pillow in my face.  I had always been worried about the airbags cause I am only 5 '4.  I tell you what those airbags saved my face I am sure.  
So as much as I would like to knock the Contour I won't.  It did get great gas mileage and ran great.  I just wish I could have owned it longer than 11 months.  <br><br>
