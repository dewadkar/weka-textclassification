            The F-250 Power stroke diesel is the best truck I have ever owned. I use this truck to pull a horse trailer and have found the transmission, automatic, reliable without a problem of jerky the horses around in the trailer. The mileage I have gotten with this truck in unbelievable compared to having always driven gas engines, as high as 22 mileage per gallon on the highway compared to 12-14 with the gas engine. I would recommend this truck for anyone that wants to haul a horse trailer as it is dependable and economical for its purchase price. Since owning a power-stroke I would never purchase another gas powered vehicle again. It is good looking with very pleasing colors to select from. Comfortable for a women to drive, which is a plus for so many of us out there hauling our own horses. Many trucks interiors are not designed to be comfortable for a women and this one seems to fit me well and my husband also is comfortable in this truck with there being a foot difference in our height and 100 pounds difference in our weight. It is an all around great truck. This is a truck that &quot;likes to work&quot;.<br><br>
