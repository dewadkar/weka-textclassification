            I have a 1993 Probe GT  and can say that it has been an incredibly reliable car for me.  What few problems I did have were easily and relatively inexpensively fixed.  My Probe has decent acceleration, fantastic handling, a well-designed interior and a great looking body. It still looks better than most other sport coupes out there, and drives as well or better than all of them.  

I purchased mine at 25K and just hit 81K with it so I've driven it for awhile.  The only problems that I've had are the ignitor module (part of the distributor), my 02 sensors (replaced cheaply with Bosch models instead of Ford's $212 ones), and the infamous rear calipers.  They were all cheap to fix with a little research and beyond them, it has been trouble-free motoring.  I don't abuse my car, but I do drive it hard and the little Mazda V6 still feels tight and like it has plenty of life still in it.  I've noticed a few squeaks and rattles, but the nothing major and certainly nothing that ANY car with 80K on it wouldn't have.  

I also purchased snow tires, and the car is a TANK in the winter with them on.  It's low center of gravity makes stopping on ice a cinch, and the front-wheel drive ensures that you'll be able to get going quickly.

As far as modifications, it isn't as easy to customize the Probe as it is an Eclipse (a turbo will do that for you), but there are steps you can take.  Exhausts, nitrous, supercharging, turbos, etc have all been done by &quot;Probers&quot;.  

Cons?  The car has HORRIBLE resale value, but this is a plus because you can pick one up very cheaply and get a great value.  Another con is the limited aftermarket support (since it is discontinued), which stems from the less than stellar acceleration.  Still, modifying your car is fun, and having a unique Probe is a lot of fun. Another con that I've heard but don't agree with is the extremely stiff ride.  People complain that it is far too harsh, but I don't really notice it.  Besides, the handling is too good to sacrifice, after all this isn't a Buick.  

I love my Probe and highly recommend it.  There are some lemons out there, but for the most part Probes are good, reliable cars.  <br><br>
