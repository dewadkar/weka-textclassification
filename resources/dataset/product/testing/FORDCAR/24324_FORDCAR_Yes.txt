            My wife and I had been married only one week when we purchased our first brand new car together back in December 1994.  It was a white 3-door Escort LX.  Why did we buy it?  Well, first off we are &quot;A-Planners,&quot; so we had buy a Ford to take advantage of the discount.  We did not want to stoop to the Festiva level and we could not afford a Taurus, so we bought the model in between.  

The best traits of the car, after 109,000 miles now, have been its durability, low cost of maintenance, fuel economy and its versatility.  Only major problem so far, and it was covered under Manufacturer's warranty was the brushes in the alternator needed replaced.  Regular oil changes and tire rotations seem to be the extent of maintenance so far. Of course brake work, new exhaust/muffler at 76,000 miles and a new belt have been about the extent of wear and tear replacement.  The car still has the original hoses with original fluid.  Only on the 2nd battery and on the 3rd set of tires (stick to Kelly Tires...they last and last...60,0000 miles no problem).  As for fuel economy, 30 MPG plus is standard fare for the Escort.  What more can I say about the hatch back version.  We have packed that car many times to the roof to go camping.  Never a problem!

Some of it's worst traits are its lack of power, body integrity and electrical failures.  Ever try taking a highway on-ramp at 70 MPH with the A/C going full blast in the middle of summer?  I bet it takes about 30 seconds to get up to 70 MPH.  But, what to you expect out of a 1.9 L 93 HP engine?  The hood and the area around the fuel lid started rusting after about 2 years.  This on a car, that receives no less than 26 car washed a year and annual wax jobs.  I think Ford needs to put better PAINT on its cars.  Lastly, I don't know how many light bulbs I have gone through in this car.  About three of the instrument panel lights have been burnt out now for 3 years.  Why won't the dome light go on when I open the door?  

The Escort has been a good investment, if you even want to talk about a car as an investment, and might be one of the best purchases we have ever made.  Will we buy again?  Probably not!  With our other vehicle being a 1998 Ford Explorer and the recent debacle with Firestone, Ford has proven that their loyalty lies not with the consumer, but with their best interest.  Replacement for the Ford Escort has already been decided.  Another long lasting car with a history of retaining its value...a 2001 Honda Civic EX.<br><br>
