            When I went looking for a new car I had no idea I would be the proud owner of a Minivan. I thought I wouldn't be able to afford a Minivan with all the features that I wanted.  
 The main thing was safety, being a mother of 3 children safety was a really big issue. So after looking at practically every make and model of the mid-size cars, my husband suggested looking at a minivan just for kicks. 
A salesman showed us a 1998 Ford Windstar. After we were told about all the safety features like the side beams in the doors that make it hard for the doors to cave in. I can't begin to describe how comfortable the seats are which make it great for the long trips we make. This Mini-van is not only luxurious it's durable. 
I work down a rough dirt road but now it's a smooth ride in my Windstar. It also handles on curves as well as straight ways.
 I also was surprised at the gas mileage that I get. I was expecting to get a lower gas mileage than I was getting in my mid-size car but I was pleased to find out for myself that I got just as good a gas mileage in the Windstar.
 The cons of the Windstar compared to other mini-vans that I looked  at were: there were no built in child seats, only 3 doors where others had 4 doors and they are a little lower to the ground than I am comfortable with.This is definitely a vehicle for families with children but I would not recommend for young drivers.<br><br>
