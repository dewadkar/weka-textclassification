            A member of my household bought a '91 Ford Explorer in February for $9,000.  It had 70,000 miles on it.  Ever since then, it has given him nothing but trouble.  He drives from Boston to Dedham and back every day and he spends about $50 a week on gas, alone.  He has had to replace an enormous number of parts, including the windshield wipers, ball joints, muffler, and front and back brakes.  Now he has been told by the Ford dealership that he needs to spend $2,000 to replace the engine.  This car is not worth the money he spent on it or the trouble that it has given him.    <br><br>
