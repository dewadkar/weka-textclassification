            My dad bought this 92 eddie bauer later in 1997. It had 86,000 on it, and it was pretty well taken care of. Well, a year later, I got my liscence, and I drove the truck (i actually dropped my dad off before work, and then picked him up for awhile) I drove 42 miles each way to school, and 17 miles each way to hockey practice 3 times a week, thats 114 miles a day 3 times a week, 82 on others. We never had a problem with the truck.

I got my own car, actually had 2, an 83 grand marquis, and then an 88 cougar, and my dad drove the truck to work every day. This was a 33 mile drive each way for him. The miles continued to add up, but the truck never had problems. I always maintained the vehicles in our family (i love workin on cars) so routine maintenence was taken care of. Then one day 2 years ago, we had an issue with the transmission, it was slipping in 2nd to 3rd. We got it fixed, and its been fine ever since. We also had the common issue where the truck shakes around 65 mph. We got that fixed, and its been fine since. We only had to recharge the air once, but thats routine maintenence as well, we upgraded to r-134, it took about an hour. We also had to recently change the valve cover gaskets, which really isnt that big of a deal. Almost all eddie bauers had the problem of the tan colored paint rotting out, we had this problem as well. We ended up getting that fixed, and painted the bottom black, to match the color of the truck. no more problems with that either (the cougar, as any of you who know about 87-88s knows, is a different story with rotting)

This year, sophomore year of college, i took the truck back and gave my dad the cougar. This would help keep the miles down, and the cougar was leaking oil, my dad didnt want me to deal with that while i was a school. Ive had the truck for 7 months now, and again have had no problems. The truck now has 187,000 on it, and its not showing any signs of giving up. The engine is a little tired, but that is expected.  

We are about to buy a 96 limited explorer (someone knocked over a light post last week and my dad ran it over on the expresssway, totalled the cougar, which was another great car, ford/murcury makes great cars) My dad actually wants the old explorer back and is giving me the newer one, if you can believe that, i think that is a great sign of how good this truck is. 

The truck has carried everything, dirt, lawn equipment, people (yes in the back), sand, anything you can think of, and the carpet is still holding up. The front leather seat has a rip in it, and the right rear speaker blew (thats my fault, i love loud music) Really this truck has been great to us, and its the reason we are getting another explorer.
