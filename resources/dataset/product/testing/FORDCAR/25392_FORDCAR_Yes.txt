               I bought a 1994 Taurus LX about a year ago.  In the past I have owned a variety of cars including all GM cars except Cadillac, Chrysler Corp. cars and Fords.  I must say that I am most impressed with the Taurus.  

   The LX model I bought has just about every option available.  From the inside it's more like driving a Lincoln than a Taurus.  The 6-way power seats with adjustable lumber support are heavenly.  I'm a large person, 6'5&quot; and 260 lbs, but have no problem with legroom or headroom.  The power windows and door locks are very convenient and the Keyless Entry system allows me to leave the car running in the winter when I run into the convenience store and still lock the doors.  The Moon Roof which either opens up in the back or slides into the roof is great for ventilation.  
   
   Being a music lover I am very impressed with the JBL sound system in the Taurus.  It came with factory installed CD player and a great Cassette player.  I had never had a CD in any of my cars before but will not be without it again.  

   I'm also very impressed with the 4 wheel disc brakes and the ABS braking system.  The ABS was another first for me and was a little different to get used to as was the front wheel drive.   The steering is a little different with front wheel drive but not at all hard to get used to.  

   The only things that I find fault with is the economy of the Taurus.  I have a fuel injected V-6 and even though I consider myself a light footed driver I find that I only get about 200 miles at most to a tank of gas in town driving.  That's partially due to the small tank (13-14 gals.) but also due to the fact that the air conditioning compressor cycles on and off even in the cold weather, winter months which reduces gas economy.  I have checked the gas mileage over several tanks of gas and find that I average around 12 to 14 miles per gallon.  I'm sorry to say that I haven't had the opportunity to do much highway driving, at least not enough to get a good idea of highway gas mileage.

   Overall, I feel very safe and secure in the Taurus and find it a very enjoyable car to drive.
