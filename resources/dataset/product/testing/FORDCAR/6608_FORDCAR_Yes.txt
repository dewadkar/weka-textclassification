            My wife and I purchased a 2000 F-150 XLT, extended cab in November 1999. I must say, we are very pleased. Our truck has the Triton 4.6 litre V-8 engine and drives like a dream. The interior is cozy and spacious, even the back seat. We have 2 small children, both still in car seats, and neither are cramped in the back. The bed carries strollers, groceries, and whatever else we might need to carry. We also have a high gear ratio (3.08) so we get roughly 18 MPG. While the baby Ford V-8 isn't as powerful as the Dodge or Chevy, it still provides plenty of getty-up for sensible driving. The 4.6 is also easy to modify, with a K&amp;N airfilter and dual exhaust systems. These 2 simple mods will cost you about $315 total and will net you 15 to 20 extra horsepower. The truck's MSRP was $24,465.00. By comparison, the Chevy Silverado with comparable options, but only a V-6 motor, was roughly $23,000. Yes, the Chevy has a little more room in the back, but it only has a 3rd door. My Ford has 4! This difference is priceless if you have children. It drives better than either a Chevy or Dodge (turning radius etc.) and is easier to maneuver in tighter spaces. We sit as high as most unmodified 4X4's, which gives us better road visibility. All in all, the truck is an outstanding buy under $24,500, and it's built, (ha ha) FORD TOUGH!!<br><br>
