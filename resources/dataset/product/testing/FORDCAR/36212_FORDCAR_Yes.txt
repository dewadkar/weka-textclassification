            Purchased a Ford FocusLX, FT&gt; Knox Gold W black interior from Brandon Ford in Tampa, FL.  had rear spoiler added soon thereafter.  Have been
treated w/ respect, kindness courtesy and I was amazed at this car. I am a
young baby-boomer.  Loved cars since I was 14, on a farm in KY, have owned
Chevy's, Mustangs, Escorts, Fiats, Toyotas, and others, and I would rate my
Focus at the very top.  Styling is so cool, driving is great due to excellent handling and driver seat positioning (Adjustable, by the way)
People give me thumbs up when driving my Focus.  I am so conscientious about keeping it clean and I am proud of this car.  It has class, sex
appeal, similar to the VW Jetta, though much lower priced.  It is not
at all &quot;up in your face&quot;, but I've notice people do double-takes to find
oout what I am driving.  Dealership was fantastic, owner Paul Levine poured me a cup of coffee when purchasing, Sales consultant, Ron Wienert 
was the most professional and courteous salesperson I have EVER encountered.  This is a genuine and sincere opinion.  My Focus is so cool,
and all family members from age 3, to age 65 love it.  Proud to back out ofmy driveway every day.<br><br>
