            Ford Thunderbird; the name alone says so much. American automakers and especially Ford have always seemed to name their cars based more on emotion than facts or market research.  Just think of it, U.S. cars have long used names that evoke certain emotions; Road Runner, Firebird, Thunderbird, Explorer, Expedition, Cougar, and Impala, powerful and descriptive names. Compare this to European and Japanese car names; 325i, V40, 626, Corolla � what is a Corolla anyway?  Even if you didn�t know �Thunderbird� was derived from a Native American god who brought prosperity, you�d still recognize the name and all it seems to imply. Thunderbird sounds powerful, mysterious, and proud. OK maybe there wasn�t much pride in the Thunderbirds of the late 70s and early 80s, but still, the name recognition alone has transcended those dark times when a T-bird was little more than a sorry copy of an under whelming Ford LTD. 

At the very least, Ford deserves credit for building the new Thunderbird at all. Plus, additional accolades should be given based solely on the fact that Ford chose to give this new T-bird a V8 engine and rear-wheel drive.  Has Ford been taken over by people who really love cars?  Very possible, just look at the semi-retro Bullit Mustang or the SVT Focus, or the crown jewel of Mercury�s past, the new Marauder.  Chrysler has recently resurrected the 300 nameplate, but the new 300M sports a V6 and front-wheel drive. Those who remember the 300 name (and isn�t that the point of naming a new car after an old car?) will first be disappointed by the very nature of the car�s drive train configuration. It�s actually not a bad car when judged on its own merits, but when judged in the shadow of the name�s past, it is found wanting. 

The new Thunderbird combines many attributes of T-birds past. Not content to simply copy one specific era, Ford has done an excellent job of blending the most noticeable elements from several old T-birds.  The new car seems to borrow most heavily from the four seat T-birds of the early 60s, often referred to as the �rocket bird� due to its round shape and rocket engine-like taillights. The rear and sides are clearly reminiscent of the �rocket bird,� while the two-seat configuration and front end styling seem to evoke the spirit of the original �55-�57 Thunderbird. The large, wide, egg-crate grille up front with small chrome bullets (driving lights on the new T-bird) inside that grille area are clear cues stolen from the early �Birds. Classic Thunderbird script done in chrome adorns the rear flanks, while front and rear bumpers are so subtly sculpted one can barely tell they are bumpers at all.

The cockpit of the new Thunderbird is a bit of a disappointment.  Brushed aluminum-looking accents brighten up an otherwise lack luster interior, and some people feel the white-faced gauges with turquoise needles add some flair. Really, there is nothing functionally wrong with the interior; it just seems to lack the pizzazz of the exterior. The center stack of the dash area seems to be lifted right out of the Lincoln LS � and it even looks a little bland for that car. A power tilt and telescoping steering wheel is a nice touch. If you want to jazz-up the inside, factory and aftermarket options are available to help the interior look a little livelier.  Body colored seat inserts and interior accents are available, as is a convertible boot cover with twin head farings to mimic the early 60s T-bird.

Seats are wide and comfortable, but lack a sporty feel. This is actually a good thing, other cars in the Thunderbird�s price range such as the Corvette offer sports seats that hug your body and keep you in place during hard cornering but often leave the driver feeling a bit cramped. The Thunderbird�s seats on the other hand are more wide and flat � this makes getting in and out a breeze.

Fire up the T-bird�s willing engine and it responds with a slight rumble.  The exhaust note is pleasant but never intrusive � honestly, a little more of the V8�s burble would be welcome.  One of the great things about this car is that it lacks the crudeness found on other modern American convertibles. The Corvette, Mustang and Camaro are all a bit rough and noisy, while the Thunderbird offers a bit of refinement. The Thunderbird isn�t down on power, even though it makes due with the same 252 hp, 3.9L V8 as the Lincoln LS, that same engine in the T-bird feels faster and more powerful.  

Acceleration is exactly what you�d expect from a car like this � more than adequate. The Thunderbird isn�t trying to prove something like a Porsche or Corvette, it is content to simply cruise along with plenty of extra power on tap should the situation warrant.  A car like the Corvette can certainly out drag-race a T-bird, but that would be missing the point. There are plenty of  cars that offer blistering straight line speed, the Thunderbird is a complete package and feels more at home cruising the boulevard on a warm Saturday night � top down, music up.

The 5-speed automatic transmission shifts up and down without drama. Occasionally, when the driver really floors the accelerator before the car has reached 5th gear, the transmission seems confused for just a second. There is a slight hesitation while the transmission finds the correct gear for the conditions.  Brakes bring the �Bird to a quick and straight stop with no evidence of pull to the right or left.

Handling is more touring car than sports car and as a result there is some body roll when cornering hard. The Thunderbird lacks the razor sharp handling of some European cars, but that compromise is well worth it during everyday driving. Uneven pavement and bad roads are not the spine crushers they could be had the Ford engineers decided to stiffen up the Thunderbird�s suspension in favor of super crisp handling. The ride is smooth and compliant making the Thunderbird capable of being both a week-end driver and everyday commuter. 17 inch wheels shod with 235/50 tires provide more than enough grip, plus the wide tires look really cool.  

From behind the chrome trimmed windshield, it gradually becomes obvious what a wonderful job Ford has done in capturing the essence of Thunderbird�s past. While driving this new T-bird, it really feels like you�re in an older Thunderbird. The round side glass and the way the top curves at the rear edge of that window combined with the long hood and short rear deck all give the distinct impression one is piloting a classic, there even seems to be a bit of squat in the back.  It is just amazing how well Ford has captured the look and feel of a vintage car, combined with the safety and performance features of today.

Overall, the 2002 Ford Thunderbird is an exceptional car in two ways. First it is exceptional that Ford built the car. Second it is exceptional how beautiful the outside of this car looks. Driving it is pure fun � the ultimate street cruiser.  This car gets noticed. Driving down an average road in an average town causes a lot of waving, pointing, thumbs-up and questions, lots of questions � �What is that?� �How much?� �What�s that color called?� �Do you like it?� �Is it fast?� �Where can I get one?� and on and on it goes. If you hate attention, stay away from the new Thunderbird. 

With an MSRP of $35,000 to $45,000 and actual transaction prices closer to $50,000, the Thunderbird is rather pricey for a two-seater and no available manual transmission.  Is it worth it?  There is just no way of saying for sure. If you fawned over T-birds past as a child, and now have the means to afford the finer things in life, there is probably no price you wouldn�t pay for a crack at this top-notch time machine. Given the choices for V8 powered convertibles, we can�t think of one we�d pick instead of the T-bird. Besides who doesn�t like a nice trip down memory lane? Especially when every one is oooh-ing and ahhhh-ing at the car you�re driving.
