            I originally purchased my new '99 F-250 because I had a travel trailer I wanted to pull around and go camp in.  Well, I ended up moving and selling the travel trailer, so now I have nothing to pull.  I ended up getting the V-8 5.4L 4x4 model.  The 5.4L is the minimum you can get in the super duty size.  I would have to suggest getting something a bit higher than 5.4L in this size of truck.  It's got decent umph, but could be better.  

So far, I haven't had a single problem (knock on wood) with my F-250.  Other than the occasional (3 so far) recall notices, I haven't had to take it in for anything.  I am noticing lately that the A/C doesn't blow very hard when it is set to MAX A/C, and I do plan on taking it in for that, but otherwise, everything is running smoothly.  I drove it around Nebraska for a few months in the snow, and it had GREAT traction in 4 wheel drive.  The back seat is roomy enough for a couple of short people or kids, but if you're over 6' you wouldn't want to sit back there.  

I've hauled 1 ton of bricks with no problems.  The only qualms I have so far is 
1.  It doesn't fit in most garages.  This is a truck meant to be left out in your driveway.
2.  It is very gas thirsty.  I get about 9mpg in the city.
3.  The turning ratio makes it difficult to park and take sharp turns.

Otherwise, I am very happy with my F-250, and would buy another one if I knew I was going to have something to tow or haul.<br><br>
