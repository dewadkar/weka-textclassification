            I am a recent buyer of the Ford Explorer, and out of all the car's and suv's I've had this has been the best one yet.  It has an extremely smooth ride and gets pretty good gas mileage for an suv.  Best of all, depending on how you look at it, I was recently in a car accident with it, and by looking at the car, you would have thought I would have been seriously hurt, but I walked away with just a few bruises.  The car has been repaired and it drives as good as ever.  Knowing what I know, I have much comfort driving.  Ford Explorer has been good to me!<br><br>
