            In May of 1995, I purchased a 1990 Ford Escort LX, 2 door, hatchback from a family friend. It was my very first car and really inexpensive. It had a 5 speed transmission. It didn't come loaded with any neat-o things, but it was my very own car in high school. Over the years, I've had to replace a timing belt, starter, battery, tires, thermostat, and engine mount.

It didn't come with an AC either, but had a great heating system. Although, the gas mileage was great and it was okay for the long trips back home when I went off to college. All in all, it was a descent car.

I say &quot;was&quot; because I recently wrecked it. It has yet to be determined if it the car is totaled. However, I don't think that I'll find a car that has been as reliable as it has been. To add to it, the automatic safety belt also saved my life.<br><br>
