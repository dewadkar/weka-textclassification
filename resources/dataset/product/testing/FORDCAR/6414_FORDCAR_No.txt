            We have owned a couple Ford Aerostars.  The 1990 model had several flaws.  The drivers seat was broken through normal wear and tear.  The Anti Lock Break notification light has never worked properly, yet there was never a recall or anything.  And the worst aspect of both is that these two and most of these models I have seen, are more apt to rust then other vehicles.  They are both have rusted out the bottom side panel between the front and rear tires.  The 1988 van has ran fairly well, however the 1990 model has had numerous mechanical problems. 

Many flaws have resulted from the mini-vans.  From the alternator not failing to a leaking gas tank.  They also have shakey starters in them as well, and a fuel injected engine that will not start without pressing the gas pedal.<br><br>
