            I have had Explorers since 1991. I started out with an Eddie Bauer...loved it...then went to an XLT Explorer for a company car...loved it. Then I just recently purchased an Eddie Bauer &quot;Limited&quot; and absolutely love it. It does everything but make your coffee in the morning.

I was attracted to a higher vehicle (I have always been a truck man)because it gives you a better field of vision and more protection in an accident than a regular car. I fell in love with the design as soon a Mazda came out with the Navijo (yes...the Ford Explorer is based on the Mazda Navijo design).

Granted the vehicle is heavier...so there is a mind set that you have to get into when it comes to stopping distance. You have to understand that SUV's can not be driven like a &quot;Bat Outta Hell&quot; and expected to stop on a dime. You also have to understand that the vehicle has a higher ground clearance so the center of gravity is going to make it a little top heavy. But again you have to understand the vehicle you are driving is not a &quot;low to the road&quot; sports car and cannot handle curves like a sports car.

My next vehicle I am going to move up to an Expedition...<br><br>
