            Ok, anyone who is looking for a car under 17,000 that is a coupe, should take a look at the Ford Escort Zx2.  This car has a lot to offer including exceptional power (a 130HP Ztech engine).  The Automatic will cost more, but I think it is funner to drive.  Lets hope that Ford dosent discontinue this nice car....

It has improved so much over the years!  I had a Mercury Tracer before and I loved it.  I love my ZX2 more though!  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality made car!

thank you
