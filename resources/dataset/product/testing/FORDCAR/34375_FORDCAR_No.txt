            I originally bought this vehicle because it was well priced and I thought it met all of my needs. As soon as I got it there were problems. Since then, I have been in every two months to have warranty service on the car done. It runs terribly. The car is two years old and it allready needed a new transmission. The car accelerates slowly and is uncomfortable. The engineering is terrible given that the seatbelts bunch up and everything seems to clatter around. As for the positives, the cruise control is easy to use! I would not recomment this car to anyone who plans to drive more then 5 mins a day without having to shoot themselves. I would also not recomment this for someone who does not have 5 hours a week to deal with the warranty service center, or for someone who likes to travel at over 15 miles per hour. <br><br>
