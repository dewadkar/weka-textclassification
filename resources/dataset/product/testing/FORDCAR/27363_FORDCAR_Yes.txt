            We just purchased the new 2001 Ford SuperCrew XLT. This truck has it all. Good looks and power. The 5.4 liter engine will pull our 3 horse trailer weighing in at about 4,500#s and a horse weight of about 3,000#s with the tack weight for a combine total of about 8,000#s.

 The fuel mileage went down somewhat with the overdrive off. Without pulling we are getting around 18-20 miles per gallon. I was really impressed with the strength of the engine. It won't win any races with this load but it did not have any loss of power on the hills around here. The inside is very roomy and comfortable. It has a very quiet and smooth ride.

 Some of the standard features of this truck are foot pedals that will adjust 3&quot; either up or down for a variety of different heights, automatic on and off light sensitive headlights and power windows that let you roll them up or down for 20 seconds after the ignition has been turned off. This truck has many other great standard options that are too many to mention.

 Some of the extra options would be leather seats, 6 disc cd changer, cab steps,remote keyless entry and two tone paint. It will seat 6 very comfortably with the bench front seat or like ours will seat 5 with the captains chairs with arms for the front seat.

 The only draw back for me on this truck is the smaller bed. It has a optional bed extender for a seven foot bed. The smaller bed also means a lot easier to turn around. I would recommend this vehicle to just about anyone. It would not be suited for some one who does a lot of hauling long objects. For towing though it was great. 

  I have just pulled our horse trailer a few times and have had the gas mileage go down from 11 mpg to 6 mpg. So if gas prices are a concern I would not pull a lot with it. I went 125 miles on one tank of gas. BAD BAD   <br><br>
