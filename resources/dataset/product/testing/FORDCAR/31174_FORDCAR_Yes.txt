            I bought my '98 v6 mustang mustang in 98 new for under $15,000 after all taxes and incidental charges and I must ask: Does a better deal exist?!?  It came with CD, tape, automatic everything (except the transmission of course .. gotta have a stick!), keyless entry, the works, and DAMN, the thing is fun.  On long trips I almost always have the speed limiter going trying to keep me at 110 mph and the thing is SOLID!  It feels like I'm cruising at 70 and is a JOY.  I've never had a single problem with it despite rather aggressive driving.  I recommend this car for ANYONE whether you drive fast or not.  If you're not interested in driving 110 or passing cars left and right (well, in the US, make sure you do it on the left) you still benefit from a low cost car with all sorts of features.  If you want to benefit from the car's power, well hell, you win twice over.  I couldn't be happier with my car; buy one!<br><br>
