            I have owned my '94 F250 4X4 for 3 years now. This truck has never not started or given me any reason to worry at all. I have put about 50,000 km. on it and have enjoyed every K. It is a hard riding truck but that is to be expected. I put the K&N filter charger kit in it and have been very impressed with the results, the 5.8L V8 just screams now and is will to give all that I ask for. I have mag wheels and upsized tires, I have added one leaf spring to the front stack to level the truck out a bit. I have spent a substantial amount of time in the back woods camping and the four wheel drive will get me ANYWHERE.

Service: When I bought the truck used I bought a used vehicle warranty. I must say that did come in handy.
The dealer will fix anything under the warranty no questions asked and that has been a good thing. I have replaced the water pump, radiator, u-joints, tie rod ends,
frost plugs, and a couple other small things. All and all maybe too many things, but not too bad.
