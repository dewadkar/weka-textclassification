            I am the owner of a roofing buisness based in massachusetts  and have a 12000# bri mar dump trailer ( used for on the job sight dumpster)  and previously owned a 1999 f 250 with the Triton 5.4 litre gas motor and  was never happy  with the performance of that truck.  So I
upgraded to this 350 diesel and can`t say enough good about it  considering the dump trailer empty weighs in @ 3400#  and i have  pulled loads to local transfer station with this weighing in  around 22000# combined weight of truck and trailer Although at this weight it is a challenge over all I love this truck and what a head turner it is.( all dolled up  xlt 4 wheel  super cab ,visor , wiper cowl, aluminum rims Truck and Trailer and lettered professionally ) I Get compliments everyday.
