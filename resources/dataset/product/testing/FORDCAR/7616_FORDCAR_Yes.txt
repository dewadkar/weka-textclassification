<TEXT>
            The 1999 Ford Mustang is a well built, slick car that has efficient 
power and feels very safe.  Eventhough when you drive it, it feels
like your driving a brick, I feel very safe in it.  The car is pretty 
big for a sports car but the seating in the back is a little crunched.
The front seats are confortable, but the back needs some work.  The
99 addition is the anniversary addition, so I think that this is a well
made car because it's the anniversary edition.  Off the line it's a little
slow but once you get going you got power.  I recommend this car for the
driver just getting their license because like I said I feel safe in the 
car.  It's not a small car that will just crumble if in an accident.  
I feel this is a car that is safe, has power and is a nice looking car.<br><br>
