            I started to lease my Ranger in July of this year. ('99) I love the look of my truck. It's green with the grey wheel well covers and the chrome front and back bumpers. It has the 4-door option, not 4 full doors though, but they come in handy when you have more than 3 people in your truck. I've had it in the mud only three times, and it's great to have if ya' like to go muddin'. (It's nothing spectacular though.) I replaced the stock cassette player with a JVC Kameleon CD player and the stock speakers actually don't sound that bad. It has a towing package which will come in handy in the winter time too. The only thing really wrong with my truck, well the 2 things wrong with my truck, is that it's a 3.0L V6 and it's bad on gas. Besides that, it's a nice truck. I've had many compliments on it and I've had many people look inside and around it. (It's fun to watch them walk up to your truck and then set off the panic button, or lock the doors and make it honk.) If your looking for a dependable truck with good looks, great history, and loads of fun, you should try a Ford Ranger on for size. I drive mine back and forth from Argos, IN to South Bend, IN twice a week. Very dependable.<br><br>
