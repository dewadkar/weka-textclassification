            This past week-end, I received an invitation I could not turn down.  A dealer friend of mine asked me to do him a favor. He asked me to give a demo of the beauty, ruggedness, durability of the F350 Lariat Super Duty Super Cab 4WD 2 Dr. Extended Cab to one of his best customers, an agribusiness patriarch.  Free opportunity to test drive this elegant vehicle!  That was the first idea to come to my mind.  When I asked my friend why this gentleman could not come to the dealership.  He replied that this guy buys so many Fords from him for his company that it was his way to give him customized service.  I thought he was right.  After all, it was a question of selling one more truck and making money.  

<b>Background:  Ford's Tradition Lives On</b>

Henry Ford, father of the Ford Motor Company, once said:  &quot;I will build a motor car for the great multitude...It will be so low in price that no man...will be unable to own one.&quot;  Without any doubt, Ford's F-Series pickup truck has managed to continue the Ford tradition of quality and innovation.  It is one of the most successful vehicle lines in automotive history.  

<b>Bonus Built or Built Stronger to Last Longer</b>

<i>2000 Ford F350 Super Duty Super Cab was built to last much longer.</i>
After reviewing with the dealer what my commission would be, I drove to a nearby gas station to fill the truck up.  Then, I headed towards the freeway.  Powered by a 8 cylinder, 5.4 liter 260 horsepower, the Ford 350 easily negotiated the entrance to the freeway under the gazes of other commuters. The exterior was a harvest gold color.  I checked around me to find out that the truck has power windows, door locks.  These features are standard on all XLT and Lariat models.  By the way, the 2000 F350 Duty Super Cab is now available in 6 models:  XL, XLT, and Lariat in 2WD and 4WD.  

If you are interested in this truck, you may want to require your own specifications.  Just like the aforementioned customer, you call the shots.  Actually, the depth of your pockets calls the shot here!  Some of the new features also include front tow hooks, spare tire lock, a heavy duty battery.  I am sure you will fall in love with the power trailer towing mirrors.  I also want to draw your attention to the buck seats.  This is a very convenient truck that will meet your individual needs.

<b>This truck is able to pull your trailer</b>

After about a 50-minute drive, I reached a little town called Goshen right on Freeway 99 here in California.  Going from Modesto to Goshen is a straight shot on the freeway.  After a few detours, I reached a compound and proceeded to the office.  There, I met an old man and two of his sons.  By the way, he talked, I could sense that this guy is not ready to let his youngsters call the shots around the farm.  I gave my presentation and showed the vehicle.  Before I even finished, the patriarch said he wants to trade in two of his trucks.  In other words, he wants two new Ford 350 Super Duty Super Cab.  &quot;Great!&quot; I told myself quietly.

I reached into my pocket for my Cellular phone.  I ended up leaving a message for my dealer friend on his voice mail.  Selling two trucks instead of one is going to make him happy!  Now, I understand why he goes out of his way to accommodate this guy.  He is an important customer!

<b>My impressions of the trip and truck</b>

I had fun driving through the Central Valley.  I enjoyed driving through the farms.  This truck was truly built for quality and enjoyment.
