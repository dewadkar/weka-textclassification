            UPDATE:
Since I wrote this review, I have gotten rid of this car and replaced it with a Nissan Sentra SE-R.

(Note that this review is for the 5-speed manual transmission Escort)

From 1991 to 2000 I drove a Nissan Sentra E, a peppy car that I managed to drive 119,000 miles before its head gasket blew. I loved that 4-speed, 2-door sedan and wanted to replace it with another Sentra after my &#14591 model bit the dust. I had to buy a new and car soon; you simply cannot survive in Southern California without a car.

Well, being that my credit is not the best in the world, I was turned down by every dealership I went to &#150 except one, a Ford dealership. Not what I had planned, but beggars can&#146t be choosers.

The salesman showed me a green 4-door 2000 Escort SE with a 5-speed manual transmission. I asked about a Focus but they assured me that with my credit, the loan for that car would probably not be approved. Honesty at a car lot? Wow.

I test drove the Escort, and decided that I didn&#146t have much of choice &#150 I needed a car NOW.

THE BAD
Okay, I was approved for financing and drove it home. The first thing I noticed was that the noise in the cabin from the 2.0L, 16-valve, 120hp engine was loud, especially at high RPMs. Not deafening, but loud enough to notice &#150 and annoy ya. Room for first and second shift throws for the 5-speed transmission could be better, at least for someone of my stature (5&#14610&#148 and 220 lbs.).

The stereo console resembles that of a Taurus, an oval-shaped unit that has controls for the AC, heater and radio/cassette. The design is indeed functional, with all buttons and controls clearly marked and within reach for easy use. This is fine and well if you plan on keeping the console intact with the factory-installed radio/cassette (like I am), but be warned if you want to buy an aftermarket in-dash stereo. I say this because if an aftermarket stereo is installed, the console will have to be replaced with one of lesser quality, which will completely destroy the smooth, organic look. Your new stereo will look so out of place that you will probably want to reinstall the factory radio (I know someone who did just that!). The sound quality of the stereo is not too bad if you don&#146t plan on turning it up too loud, or if you are expecting it to thump. Sound quality of the cassette player is just like, well, a cassette.

I&#146ve been driving with a 12-volt radar detector for years, and driving the Escort would be no exception. The cigarette lighter plug, which is placed stupidly over the passenger cup holder, leaves no room for the passenger&#146s beverage if it is larger than a regular can of soda. Oh, they can use the rear seat cup holder, but one swerve or sharp turn and their drink is all over the rear floor.

Speaking of the rear, getting in and out of the rear seat requires contortionist agility unless you are a small child. Once you manage to find a way in, you&#146ll notice that there isn&#146t much legroom, at least for adults. Kids will be just fine.

THE GOOD
Yes, there are some nice things to say about this little car.

For the price (about $12k, plus taxes and all that junk) it came with power steering, AM/FM cassette, intermittent wipers and AC. The only thing I wish it came with: anti-lock brakes (ABS). Not too bad for an economy car.

Truck space is adequate, and allows me to leave my golf bag safely stowed away and still have enough room for grocery bags. If I do indeed require more space, the 60/40 fold-down rear seat will give me just that.

Tires are surprisingly large for this car, which make for a smoother ride than those little 155/80 R13&#146s that most economy cars are fitted with.

Mileage is also a big plus. After almost two years I still average at least 25 MPG (city/highway combined). I&#146ve driven to Las Vegas twice, a 300-mile journey, on a full tank and still had a little over � left when I got there. I&#146ve also driven to San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico without any problems. I plan on taking going back to Las Vegas again within a week of this review.

That last sentence sums up what you really should expect from a compact car: reliability. Knowing I can jump in my car, turn the key and get going assures me that my Escort, despite its flaws, will be around awhile and still be able to give me the freedom I need.
