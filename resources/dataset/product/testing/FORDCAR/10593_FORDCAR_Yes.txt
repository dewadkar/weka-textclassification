                 I just recently leased a 2000 Ford Ranger XLT and love it.  I had to get a new truck when my lease ran up on my 1998 Ford Ranger.  And I wondered whether to get another lease on a new Ford Ranger or finish the payments on the 1998 Ranger.  But I went to the dealer and they gave me a cheap 48 month quote and I agreed.
     I like the front of the truck better than the '98 model because there is more room and more features in the 2000 model.  The cigarette ashtray is in a bit of an awkward position but if you don't smoke it doesn't matter.  The truck's back (XLT MODEL) is only for small kids, because they have fold down seats, but it is cramped and no leg room.  The Ranger is only for errands around town(not long 2 hour trips).  
     This is a great recreational vechcle and is a great truck for the price.  I enjoy just driving with my wife taking rides on a Sunday afternoon.  This is not a heavy duty truck but it can haul small things with the small bed, if you need something heavy duty Ford F150 is good for that. I really enjoy this truck and might even consider to keep it instead of turning it back in this time. <br><br>
