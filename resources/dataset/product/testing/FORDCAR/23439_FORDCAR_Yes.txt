            We bought our Ford Taurus Wagon in 1993. It was a 1988 model and had 2 former owners. It has been a gem until 2 months ago. 
We are the kind of people who run our vehicles and don't take very good care of them. 
Sure we change the oil, sometimes. We never take it for check-ups unless it's sick. lol. 
We have had a good time in this car. We have taken it everywhere we went. It has been a great one. 
The convenience of the 3rd seat in the rear is great. When we have extra children to take it really comes in handy. When the 3rd seat is down it locks and you can put your personal things in there and lock it so nobody knows it's there. Like when you go somewhere that you don't want to carry your purse or if you have packages and you go in another store.
This car gets great gas mileage. Even though these cars look long and hard to drive they are actually easy to drive. You can see everything around you and the mirrors work great. 
I would recommend this car to everyone who wants a wagon. As a matter of fact they are hard to come by. When we were looking to buy one, every time we went to a lot looking for one we were told they are hard to come by.
