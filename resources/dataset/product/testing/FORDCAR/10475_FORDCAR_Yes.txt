              Being a new college graduate back in 1993 I decided I was finally at the point in my life where I could afford a BRAND NEW vehicle.  I was excited and anxious to find something that would be the perfect match for me.  I needed something reliable with cargo space (and not to mention cute!). 
  My dad works for Ford and together we were able to find what I was looking for...MY new Ford Ranger Extended Cab pickup.  Being frugal at the time I bypassed the electronic windows and doors, but I never felt I was shortchanged with what I got.  It also just had a 4 cylinder but I never felt it was short on power for what I needed.
  I loved the design of the components in and out.  Everything was fully functional and the interior was roomy.  In the cab, there were two foldable seats with seatbelts.  There were storage bins on each side and a mesh storage compartment against the back of the cab.  One thing I particularly liked was being able to enclose the entire back part of the cab simply by pulling out a type of sleeve; it was great to use when you had stuff you wanted to keep concealed.  This was a funnnn vehicle.  I still have memories of cruising smoothly around the loop in San Antonio at night with the stereo cranked and all of the windows open.
  Well, those days ended when family life came along and we traded it in for a Ford Contour (ugh--I have reviewed that too if you are interested in seeing it).  When I get done with my second degree I'll again purchase a new vehicle and it will be a Ford Ranger.<br><br>
