            I had been driving a 1984 Ford Mustang and wanted a car that would be reliable and that had air conditioning.  I am a mother of two children and reliability was of upmost importance to my family.  My husband and I decided to trade our beloved Mustang in on a 1994 Thunderbird. 

 We bought it from Auto Nation so that we had a &quot;big name&quot; dealership to fall back on if anything went wrong.  Well, let me tell you the problems started almost the minute we drove off the lot.  The transmission was shifting hard from first into second, so much so, whiplash was a possibility.  So we took it back to the dealer, it was fixed. 

 A few days later, the transmission started downshifting on its own.  I would be driving down the freeway at about 65 MPH, then it would shift into second gear.  Talk about nerve racking.  So the car went back to the dealer again.  Needless to say, the car has been in the shop for the transmission at least 10 times, and nobody can find the problem. 

 When we bought this car, it only had 36,000 miles on it and it was in beautiful shape.  The problem with the transmission is not consistent and the mechanics can't seem to tell us what is causing it to foul up.  The LAST TIME the car was in the shop, I told the service manager that they wouldn't be seeing my car again until the transmission fell out.  That's how frustrated I have become.  I love my Thunderbird, but the transmission seems to be possessed by Gremlins.  <br><br>
