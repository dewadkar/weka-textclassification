            The Expedition is the perfect full sized car. I don't recommend the Eddie Bauer, for one thing it's more expensive than the XLT Sport Package. And another thing is the extra features you can get for it, covers the sleek style by cluttering up the exterior. All Expeditions come with tinted windows near the back, to make your Expedition even more sleek you should tint the driver and passenger windows also. It gives it a fuller more sharp look.

When choosing a color you have to consider your surroundings. If you live down a dirt road Black and White have tendencies to increase the look of dirt. It is all based on your opinion. I have an Expedition myself so i know this information from experience.

The handling of the car is great. 4x4's adjust the steering wheel's stiffness depending on how fast you go to prevent accidents on the road.

It can hold 8 people. The interior resembles a Suburban except the trunk space is smaller. But if you need more room in the car all the seats can fold down into a flat surface.

So if you carpool for anyone it is the perfect car and it's safety features are the best. If you have any other questions regarding the Expedition please feel free to post your comments.<br><br>
