            Will my 1993 Ford Tempo EVER die?

That is the question I ask myself frequently.  I told myself that I would keep this car, and drive it until it won't let me drive it anymore.  

I bought this car almost six years ago, when my beautiful Saab went to car heaven.  I needed a car quick and I needed something that I didn't have to push, tow, or pray over daily to start.  I had become so attached to my Saab, but for all of the wrong reasons.  I loved my Saab because it was stylish, looked expensive, and quite frankly, I looked kinda cool driving it.  Nevermind the fact that it broke down more than it ran.  When it died, I thought about how much money that I had put into it, and realized how materialistic I had become over a silly car. I had become everything that I despised; A person who cared about objects as much as people.  Don't misunderstand, I still wanted something that had a look that appealed to me, but dependability was my main goal.  A friend of mine told me about a Ford Tempo that had just hit the lot, and told me that I should consider purchasing it.

When I saw it on the lot, I wanted to release my lunch.  It was the ugliest thing that I had ever seen.  It's metallic royal blue color was the first thing that made me want to sprint, in the opposite direction, like a track star.  I don't like blue much, but this blue was making me ill.  The fat, rounded shape of this car, and the funky plaid seat coverings topped off the package.  This was definitely not something that I could get excited about.  As I was looking at other cars that the dealer had to offer on the lot, that eyesore Tempo kept sticking out like a sore thumb.  A Nissan Sentra, sitting right beside the Tempo tempted me with it's sporty, contoured look.  I wanted it.  But remembering my goal, the Tempo was a smarter, more reliable pick.  My mechanic friend said that it was in great condition, and I would be pleased with it's reliability.  I kept thinking about how ugly it was.  Yuck yuck!  Again, I remembered my goal, and I purchased it.  

I had a funny feeling about this car from the beginning, and my feelings have now been sufficiently justified.  This car is the most dependable car I have ever owned.  

With a 4 Cylinder, 2.3 Liter, 96 Horsepower Engine, it may not be ready for the race track, but it serves its purpose of smooth highway and in city driving.  On an average, I get about 30 miles per gallon of gas that I put in this little ugly duckling.  Compared to some of the other cars that I have owned, this makes me a happy driver.

The seatbelts automatically activate across your chest when you shut the door.  This is a big plus for those who forget to buckle up.  There are cops everywhere handing out tickets for not wearing them, so I do highly appreciate this feature.  

The interior is roomy, you can fit quite a few friends into a Tempo, and the seats are very comfortable.  The air conditioning is cold enough to freeze your nose hairs, but it will only blow out of the panel vents.  You cannot choose any other place to release the A/C, like you can with the heater.  With the heat controls, you can choose vents, floor or defrost/floor.  My Tempo is a sturdy feeling car.  When I bought it, it had a modest 20,000 miles on it's odometer.  It now has close to 70,000.  It has been to several states in the U.S. and each time, no matter the weather conditions, I have been able to drive feeling safe, and secure.

The most important feature of this car to me is that it is highly dependable.  In 5 years, I have only had it in the repair shop one time, and that was for very minor repairs.  This car just won't call it quits.  As much as I would like to buy a new car, I have promised myself that I would drive this one, until it won't let me drive it anymore.  Obviously, it must like me.  It still is running as perfectly as when I drove it off the lot.  

I feel like there should be a moral to this story, however, I can't think of a clever one.  Perhaps this;  Don't cherish things more than you cherish people.  Quit while your ahead.  Listen to your mother.  Stay in school..........Don't rate other reviews poorly, just because the writer doesn't know how to end their review.<br><br>
