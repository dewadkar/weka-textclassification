            For over a year now this car has provided me with fun and comfort. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a comfortable car that wants a good bit of get up and go when needed. 

The transmission (AX4N) is the only real weak point of this car (unless you just plain out don't like the styling). All five seating positions have a good bit of comfort along with decent headroom (when equipped with a sunroof). All buttons, indicators, and gauges are very easy to read and follow. Center shifter feels a little cheap but it would be ok if it was leather wrapped. Sunroof controls are great but I still keeping wishing for it close in one touch like it opens, but I can overlook that. 

Trunk space is the best. I haven't seen any other car that has more trunk space, and to top it off the rear seats fold down to hold even more. Very nice touch. Also located in the trunk of all 1998 SHOs is a 6 Disc changer. This wasn't the best of choice for the changer because it will tend to skip on bumpier roads but still not that bad. 

Road harsness is handled through a fully independant suspension connected to two stage struts. For the most of the ride it is set to "soft" mode which provides a nice smooth ride. Once you get start to drive it ruff or take a corner fast the struts will go to "firm" mode to keep the car planted on the ground. 

Another special feature in this car is the engine itself. The engine is a 32V V8 with a special secondary intake design to provide both better fuel economy and more low end and mid range torque. I will not go into detail on the secondary intake design of this engine but to learn more please goto www.v8sho.com.
