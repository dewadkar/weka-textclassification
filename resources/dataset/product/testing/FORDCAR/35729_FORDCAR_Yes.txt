            I purchased a 1997 Ford Mustang GT.  The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was that fact that it was stick (manual).  The car looks wonderful and had no body damage what so ever.  Just a missing Gear shift ball, so i went out and picked up a eight ball.

The car looks wonderful, black leather and black exterior.  No dents or scratches anywhere.  The car has an awesome body style and looks simply amazing when cruising through the streets.

The car came with the top of line features, cd player, nice speakers, leather, etc.  The car has a 4.6 liter engine, and has some serious gitty-up.  Not many cars can handle this baby on the road.

The handling is great.  It corners very nicely and you are able to make good manuvers.  The only bad side is your seated pretty low and have to get used to the lowness when driving.

The seats are fairly comfortable for 2 people.  I don't recommend filling this car with more than two people the back tends to be pretty small and not much room for people.  Althought the bucket seats are very well designed, with electronic adjusting.

The car was a great buy and I recommend it to any one.  For 17,000 bucks I feel it was a steal.  And, stick isn't that bad, after time it actually becomes fun to drive.  Not to mention you get a better jump off the line!!!<br><br>
