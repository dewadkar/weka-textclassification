            We are the proud owners of a 2000 SD crew cab, V10, LB, F250 and I have to tell you it is one hell of a truck.  We have had it for 2 months and I am still a little nervous behind the wheel of this bad boy.  Parking it is somewhat of an ordeal and I usually just head towards the end of the lot.  It is not just a girl thing, either.  My husband also finds parking this rig to be a real pain.  On the plus side, it has tons of power and can tow anything we want it to, it looks great and has lots of room inside.  I am really glad we went with the crew cab- it makes it so much more functional for us.  We also own a ford expedition and this is a much rougher ride and is a lot harder to park.  We have the V10 and are getting 11.2 mpg.<br><br>
