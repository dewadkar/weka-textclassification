            When we were deciding to purchase a new mini-van I was purposely looking for dual sliding doors with remote.  I had a van that had one and I absolutely loved it, and didn't want to step down to a van without it.  

We were JUST looking and spotted this van.  It has a two tone exterior color with tan on the bottom and spruce green on the top.  It looks like a medium to dark taupe really.  I feel in love with the way it looks, but did it have the most important sliding doors?  Upon closer inspection, we found out if had everything....that's why I feel in love with it, I was supposed to, right?   It had the leather interior, cd/cassette player (another BIG plus to me), captain seats in the second row, backup sensors, both doors were electronic and the all important towing package (ok, that was important to my husband).  

We drove the van and I did love the way it drove and handled and the kids loved it too.  It has all the regular items, like power windows, power locks, child safety locks on the doors, and the new Isofix system for car seats.  I thought that would be a great plus, only to later find out that there is only 1 car seat out now made for the Isofix system.  

The seats can all be removed for hauling bigger items, but I have never moved the seats, with 3 kids all the time, I can't move them around!!  

There is also a net in the back for keeping packages falling out of the car when you open the back.  Also there are hook-like spots to hang the plastic bags from the grocery store onto, so your packages stay in place.  There are 3 cup holders in the last row of seats and one big holder for the bigger items.  There are great fold down cup holders on the second row of seats on the captain chairs.  For the driver and passenger, there is a pull-out cup holder and change holder that holds any size drink you have.

This van has the towing package and I will tell you the only reason I know about this is because my husband makes a big deal about it all the time.  When the van has the towing package, you can tow more pounds and it also comes with the bigger wheels.  We can tow up to 2600 pounds.  I know that!!

Well, we ended up buying this van and I still have it and will not give it up anytime soon.  It now has 23,000 miles and there is nothing wrong it.  It did have the engine light on and when I took it back for service, they did find a "bulletin" on this same thing and they promptly ordered all the parts and fixed it.  

This van gets about 20 miles per gallon, which is good in my opinion and that is on the highway and around town.  It does have a 26 gallon tank and that does seem to make a difference with gas prices nearly $2.00 a gallon, it takes almost $40 to fill her up!
