            Let's face it. I drive everyday, everywhere through the crowded streets of Clearwater, Tampa, and St. Petersburg Florida. We're talking pot holes, bad traffic, hot weather, tourists and a plethra of all sorts of roadside nastiness. The Ford Taurus however is a top contender in my book. Every time you go out for a drive with these conditions you are literally putting your life on the line, with the Taurus I can feel a lot better about driving around because of it's safety features. 

It's a nice hefty car, built with potential disasters in mind, that won't crumple up if you find yourself the victim of a car crash. Airbags on both sides, secure (although I did have to call pop-a-lock once, and saw just how easily the car could get broken into.

It is a nice low profile vehicle. Perfect for not drawing attention to ones self, and depending on your profession that might be a nice feature to have in a vehicle. Not to flashy, but has just enough features and flair to be considered a "luxury car". I refer to it as "the working mans luxury car".

The stock stereo sounds great, but it's not something I would crank up to full volume and go booming around the town trying to impress the ladies with. 

Oh, yes, and air conditioning. We're talking ARCTIC FREEZE here. This cars air conditioning can give you pneumonia in July!
