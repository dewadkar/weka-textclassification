            A friend of mine recently made the purchase of a 1994 Ford Thunderbird and it is well worth the price.  It has many great features, and not many faults, but I will name what I can.

<b>FEATURES:</b>

- Leather seats
- Great stereo system
- V8 engine
- Good A/C
- Roomy interior
- Sleek exterior appearance

<b>FAULTS:</b> (and why)

- Leather seats ~ Hard to clean, and when the are clean they are really slick.
- Dark color ~ Hard to keep clean looking; chips and scratches are very visible
- Flood damage from the previous owner ~ Explains itself

Overall this car was a great find.  It has nearly all the features of a great sports car, but you can fit more than 2 people at a time.

Ford has done a great job in the past and they are still working hard to out-do the competition and my only hope is that they continue to do so.

If you are looking for a great car to have fun in, but still be able to take all of your friends with you, the Ford Thunderbird is the car for you.  Thank you, that is all.
