            My 1998 Ford Escort has almost 36,000 on it and I must tell you I have been very happy with my car. It is a four door, and the back seat is very roomy.  My kids can have their friends go with us on trips, as 3 people can fit in the back seat.  The front seats tilt back enough for roomy leg room.  My six foot 2 son's head does not hit the roof!  It is also very good on gas.  A tank of gas can last me around 150 miles.  I think it is very easy to drive and compact enough to find a good parking spot!  The trunk is spacious, also.  We camp a lot and I can fit in the trunk all the gear we need for a weekend, including tent, sleeping bags, firewood and cooler.  I plan to pass this car along to my youngest when he turns 16, I'm sure it will run as well for him as it has for me!<br><br>
