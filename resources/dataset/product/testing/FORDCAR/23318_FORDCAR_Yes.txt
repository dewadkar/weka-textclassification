            I do not own a taurus but I did have the chance to drive my boss' taurus wagon for a day and overall I found it to be a good car for the price.  I believe my model year he owns is a 1994.  In any case, the car is mechanically great after racking up over 125K miles.  The transmission is a gem!  Shifts are not noticed at all and there is never any delay of power going to the wheels between gears.  Acceleration is poor, but being it is a wagon and not desgined for fast driving, it is reasonable.  The standard 4 cyliner does well and returns descent gas mileage of around 22 MPG around town.  

Syling on the exterior is wonderful!  Back when taurus was first released in 1986, it was the first aforddable car to look aerodynamic and just plain cool for a sedan.  Beleive me when I say this taurus looks cool for a wagon.  The lines on the car are clean and it is designed to appear like it was formed from one piece of steel.  Right angles are minimized to giv ethis appearance.  Great idea!  

The interior is fair in this car.  All materials scream the word cheap, but have held up well after so much use.  The plastics and cloth used for the dash and seats looks as if it was mass produced; a bad thing.  The rear view mirror is too small, the instrument cluster too small, and the radio is monted too low.  Ford did put in steering wheel controls for the radio, but a better fix would have been a better designed dash.  The speaker grills are also very poorly done.  The way it says "stereo" on them makes them appear to have been buoght at a flea market and glued on .  The seats completely lack lateral support and make you feel like you are sittinng on a bus instead of in a car.

Overall, I'd reccomend the car to potential buyers becasue prices on it are low low low.....a nice example can be had for under $4500.  This is an excellent alternative to buying a priecy SUV.  The $30K+ you save can be used to buy a coupe or sedan as a second car that can be used when the kids don't travel with you.
