            Horses plus dogs equals Big Truck! When our F250 Power Stroke regular cab became too small for two people and three dogs it was time to upgrade. Our F250 had been an awesome truck with absolutely no problems so when the time came, it had to be another Ford.

After much searching, we chose the 2000 Ford F250 Super Duty Crew Cab. Big and Red! The Lariat package was unnecessary splurge but when you are already spending $35+, what's a few more thousand? From the moment we saw this truck on the lot, we knew it was the one we had to have. The interior has the feel of an Expedition. There is so much room in the front, you don't feel like you are in a pickup truck. The new 4 door option has turned out to be perfect for us. It holds eighteen 50lb bags of feed on a rainy day as well as three exited Cur dogs.

This truck drives like a dream. Ford has made this year's diesel much quieter. If I was a braver woman, I would not hesitate to take it into a drive through where I know they could now hear my order.

This is the most awesome vehicle we have ever owned. When the time comes, the next one will be the 4 door, without a doubt.<br><br>
