            I asked my Master mechanic to recommend the best running economy car to buy and he said Ford Escort. If I was going to be making car payments I did not want to be making repair payments at the same time.

I did purchase the extended warranty with my Escort. I know often you are told it is a rip off but in this case I broke even. I paid for the repairs over the three year loan NOT all at once. I did have to change the headlights a few times, they seemed to burn out quickly. I also liked the fact that any mechanic I took it too knew how to work on Escorts.

I like the fact that you can put the back seat down if you are carrying bulky items. There is plenty of legroom in the front. If you are tall like I am the back is a bit cramped. It is fine though for children.

I got great gas mileage with my Ford Escort. It was amazing on the highway.

I must admit though since there are so many Escorts on the road when I went to the mall it was a pain to find. I always had to remember a landmark or I would be looking all day.

If you are looking for reliable transportation this is the car for you.<br><br>
