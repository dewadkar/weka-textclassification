            The Focus was not my first choice. It wasn�t my fifth choice. If I had my way at the time, I would've never bought one. No, being 21 at the time, I wanted a Mustang or a Cherokee. The last thing I wanted was a 'cute' car. After being turned down by no less than five Auto dealerships for not having a Co-signer. One of which was even a hole in the wall, back door dealership that specialized in clunkers. I was praying for anything that rolled. I finally made my way to Ford. More of a 'What else do I have to lose' attempt than anything else. After some time, they got me into a Brand new 2000 Ford Focus SE. Thank God for their First Time Buyers Program. After having the car for one year and have put 20k miles on it. I can tell you that I absolutely love this car. From the look of the car to the handling and the room this car cannot be beat in its class. 

'Looks'

To be honest, I wasn't impressed by the looks of this car at first glance. For the most part, I thought the car looked good just that headlights and the snubby front end took awhile getting use to. The hatch back I thought, and still do think, leaves allot to be desired in the looks department. The station wagon stretches its body far enough to compensate for the snubby front end. Despite my first impression, I have grown to love the unique look of this car.

Interior

To look at this car from the out side, You could have flashes of claustrophobia from the idea of sitting it. Looks can be deceiving. In this case they are. I am 6' tall and can sit comfortably in this car. Being a compact car, people sitting in the rear seat may have some discomfort. Over all I am very impressed with the legroom and ergonomics of this car. It even feels roomier that my Grandmother Gallant! The controls of this car are easy to reach from the divers side. Blinkers, wipers, Cruise control can all be reached without taking any of your hands of the wheel. The hazard light switch has been removed from its traditional place from the steering column and has been placed in plain sight on the dash. At first I was wondering if they did this BC I would be using it allot. So far, after 20k miles, I have only used it to draw attention to my car BC it was parked in a fire lane. From the well thought out intersecting triangle design of the dash to the cup holders. This car gets two thumbs up in the interior department.

Performance

This is where there could be some improvement. Even though the z-Tec engine I have is nice, They could�ve got more than 130 HP out of it. It gets me 25 mpg so I think it�s a good trade off. Being young, I would like to have a Gas guzzling, 8 cyl. Engine that make you own the road (and many tickets). That isn�t economically feasible at this point in my life nor is it physically possible to fit one into that car. So, while my humble little car isn�t tearing up the competition at the drag strips its not tearing up my limited bank account either. The car handles very well, around sharp corners the car will list only a little giving you better control of the vehicle. The suspension handles very well, the car rides allot like cars in more expensive classes and not like the bumpy, rigid ride that I'm used to out of compact cars. The Focus is a little higher off the ground that most compact cars and as a result, controls can seem to get lose at higher speeds (90-100) due to the extra amount of air allowed to flow underneath the car. No, if you have spoiler it won�t help it just for show. Sorry.

Cargo Room

As far as the amount of objects you can carry in this car is amazing. I can fit my 10-piece drum set with cymbals, stands etc etc, a amp (for speaker cabinet), speaker cabinet, two guitars, 2 monitors, mixing board, amp (for monitors), keyboard, mikes, cables etc etc.. and still have room for a person to sit in the passenger�s seat. Wow. I was totally impressed with this. If you don�t believe me, go look at a focus (sedan) and you'll soon see.

Grievance

The brakes, ford decided to fit the focus with exposed metal brakes. There is no brake drum/cover (or whatever it is called) on this car. You can see the pads by looking through the rim. Since the pads are exposed, they can get wet, and will develop a bit of rust on them if they stay wet for a few hours. So for the first few times that you press your brakes they will squeal horribly until you wear off that fine layer of rust, (this is what a mechanic has told me). I found that applying and leaving your emergency brake on while you�re not in your car could help minimize that squealing. Never the less, its is an annoying and sometimes embarrassing problem. 


In conclusion, depending on what eyes you see this car through. It can either be a well designed economic blessing or a low-class cheap pile of bolts. If your used to Luxury cars like BMW's and the like, Steer away from the Focus, It'll never live up to your standards. On the other hand, To a young 22-year-old man, this car is just what the doctor ordered. A sporty looking, easy on the wallet, alternative to the gas guzzling SUV's and Muscle cars. Definite steps up from what most young people are used to driving. If this is you, A focus would be a great investment. Especially with the low price tag (12-17k) and Ford�s First time buyer program it's a great way to build your credit. The payments stay low too (I finance at 326/month). As for me, I plan on keeping this little buddy of mine for many years to come.
