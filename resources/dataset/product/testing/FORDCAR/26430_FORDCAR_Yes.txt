            The Ford Windstar has got to be the best family vehicle I have owned, or had the pleasure of riding in.  I have to admit, I'm a SUV man at heart.  I love the idea of having cargo room with four-wheel drive behind it.  The ability to take the kids to school, then ride off to go mountain climbing with a ton of lumber in the back is very appealing to me.  That's why, after having a little Dodge Omni for quite a while, I bought an 85' 4Runner when I realized I would have a family.  Although it fulfilled my daydream, reality soon set in.  It was old to start with, hard to get the kid in and out, and really bad on maintenance.  When I went to look for a newer vehicle to replace my decrepit 4Runner, I realized that there was no way I could afford one!  In the end, I had to give in to the statistics.  The Windstar is one of the top ten safest vehicle's on the planet.  The inside is pure luxury, and the backseat takes about 30 seconds to pull out for extra cargo room.  With features like breakaway mounts for the engine, automatic anti-theft, and the front airbags, I don't think I'd let my wife, along with our second unborn child, ride in anything else.  When I got a family, all my priorities changed.  Their safety is all I think of.  Doesn't mean I have to sell that old 4Runner, though.
