            We set out to buy an Escort or Tracer for our second car replacing a 9 year old Tracer which was a very dependable vehicle.  The sales rep at the Ford dealer is a friend of ours and advised us to hold off a few months until the Focus arrived as he had seen it at a preview and was very impressed.  Since we were friends and trusted his judgement, we waited several months and when the Focus's arrived we got the first look.  We test drove the car in city and country and immediately liked it.  We took one from the first delivery.  We have been extremely pleased with the purchase.  The car handles like a much bigger car and is comfortable on longer trips, a minus of the Tracer.  Suspension is tight and it corners very well.  Interior is very roomy for a small car.  a six footer can sit in either front or back seat and have headroom.  Visibility is excellent also.  We think that it is stylish also, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder.   We would definitely buy another and recommend it to friends.<br><br>
