            Ford offers some very impressive features in this car which is supposed to be their "entry-level" model.  For some reason Ford doesn't advertise this; but if you get the stability control (which is more than traction control) package (StabiliTrac), you get some nice extras:  4 wheel disc brakes and rear head restraints.  I had read about these items on the web somewhere; but until my car was delivered, I wasn't sure that they would really come with the car since Ford never mentions them in their literature.  These are two items that I like because they improve the safety of the car.  Being safety conscious, I also got the side air bags.  I had to order my car since no dealer had one with the stability control and side air bags on their lot, but who minds waiting a couple of weeks to get an inexpensive car with just about all of the safety features available anywhere?  INCREDIBLE.

The handling and performance have been great.  Good and peppy and 16" wheels handle Chicago potholes with barely a bump to the passengers.  Corners well (I'm not exactly a defensive driver) too.  Radio volume automatically adjusts to the speed of the car (faster=louder, slower=quieter) so that it isn't too loud when you come to a stoplight.  The steering wheel not only tilts, but also telescopes; and the driver's seat is manually height adjustable which I like even better than a power seat.

The three annoyances are the angle that the key goes into the ignition (feels awkward), the parking brake is awkward to pull-up with the arm rest down, and the headlight/high-beam switch doesn't push forward for high-beams and pull back for a "flash-to-pass" feature.  I got used to that last item on my old car.  Anyone at Ford reading this, please pass these items to the design team because fixing them would make this car perfect.

Overall, the car has been really nice.  Other than the dealer putting a small scratch in it when filling the gas tank for delivery (dooh!), there hasn't been a single problem in 3,000 miles.  I plan on keeping this car for a long time and have already changed the oil with Mobil 1 synthetic.
