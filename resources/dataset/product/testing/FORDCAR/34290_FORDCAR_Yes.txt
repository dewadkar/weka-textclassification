            When we finally decided our family of three needed to become larger we decided to opt for a larger truck. We knew for sure we needed a back seat and we wanted at least a third door. When we found out F-150 XLT with an extended cab and third door there was no doubt that we had found the right truck. The room in the back seat is awsome. 

My husband who is 6'3 and 280 lbs can sit comfortably in the back if he has to be back there for some reason. The a/c will practically freeze you out if you have it turned up and since I am native to Florida that really says alot. The stereo sounds great before you begin adding any custom speakers or any other item that you may have in mind. The front seat is roomy enough to sit reclined on a long trip. The drive in this truck is very smooth, almost comparable to a Cadilac. 

As a mother of 2 I would recommend this truck to anybody who enjoys driving a truck over cars and SUV's. It is roomy enough to be a family vehicle and great for even the single person or couple who enjoys the extra space that the back seat provides.<br><br>
