            Back in 1989 I was living in Germany and driving a German Ford Sierra, the first Ford product I had owned since '66.  I ended up in a five-car accident on the autobahn (rear-ended by a BMW), and had to buy a new car.  I needed a US specification car (so I could bring it back here) but one that was equipped for the autobahn.  The Sierra was totaled, but its good brakes, good handling and, yes, crush zones allowed me to step out unhurt and with no liability.  So I looked at another Ford product.  The Taurus SHO was an obvious choice.  I bought the Taurus by telephone, without even having ridden in one, and it was shipped to me in Germany.

My family and I used the SHO in Europe for the next 3 1/2 years.  I loved (and still do) that car on the autobahn.  If I wanted to drive up a mountain at 100mph, I did it.  Never kept the pedal to the floor long enough to find its true top speed; at 135 mph the horizon comes up on you awfully fast.  The speed-rated tires, four-wheel disc brakes, and solid suspension are confidence-inspiring.  The performance comes from an efficient 3.0 liter engine, not brute force, thus gas mileage is excellent  The driver's seat is the most comfortable I have ever enjoyed; I can drive 500 miles in a day and step out feeling fine.

My wife enjoyed driving the SHO on the highway, but not in the city.  It is a firm-riding, fast reacting car.  My SHO was one of the first produced.  The initial clutch (manual trans.) was a stiff and abrupt truck clutch, but still could not handle the load. Ford reinforced the clutch at no cost.  Later, at about 80-90,000 miles, I had the clutch replaced with a newer model which handles very smoothly.

Back in the United States, my SHO constitutes a temptation to speed.  It is a great open highway car.  Not a stop-and-go traffic car.  Not a winter snow car.  It performed very well in the high speed traffic of the Washington, DC, expressways.  When you see a gap in the traffic, it will get you there quicker than the competition.  The high reving engine and 5-speed allow you to select the right combination to maximize performance.

I drove my Taurus to work today.  After more than ten years and 136,000 miles it is still comfortable, dependable, has its performance, uses no oil, and can put a smile on my face.  My point is not to get you to buy a 1989 Taurus.  It does demonstrate that Ford can build and back a dependable Taurus.     <br><br>
