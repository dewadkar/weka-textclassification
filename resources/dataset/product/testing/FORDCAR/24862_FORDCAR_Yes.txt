            The Ford Mustang has to be the most beautiful, muscle bound, hardcore,rubber slinging, sports car ive ever had the intense pleasure of seeing. I am very honored to be able to get this car in the next couple of years, I hope and pray this will be the next car I get. I am madly in love with this car and I see absolutely nothing wrong with it. Ive always loved this car ever since my dad told me that he had had a Boss 302 Mustang. Ever since then I have wanted a Brand new Mustang GT with race yellow paint, leather interior, five speed, cd player,and basically fully loaded. I really like this car for many reasons the main one being that it is one of the last few American muscle cars. I truly believe that a mustang can beat any other muscle car on the market.  <br><br>
