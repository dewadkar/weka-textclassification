            This is my first "non-car" vehicle I've ever owned and I absolutely love it. It was difficult to pay as much for it as I did, but I am very happy with the purchase and would do it again in a heartbeat. It has just over 8000 miles and has never had any problems. The ride is smooth and quiet (I LOVE the lumbar support). My friends (whom drive trucks) are amazed at the ride comfort.

The bed may seem short, but it has never let me down. I've moved my kitchen table, chairs, furniture, and 2 Queen mattresses in the bed (not at the same time). Using the Bed Extender and the handy tie-down handles located at the top of the bed, it can carry a lot!

4X4 handles great too! It's gotten me through heavy snows and I actually got to use it off-road once (in the mud) with no problems. For more info, visit http://www.teamsporttrac.com
