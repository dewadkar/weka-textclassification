            I recently purchased my 1993 Ford Bronco XLT, and I love it. The Bronco is my first vehicle, and I had to have it the day I saw it. I had been looking around for about a year and a half, when I stumbled across this one on a popular used car search site. I had been indecisive of what I wanted. I drove other similar SUVS, like the Explorer and the Blazer, but I kept coming back to the Bronco. I had been told the Bronco is a beast of a vehicle, but it roughly the size of a Dodge Grand Caravan. Once you drive a Bronco, you'll never want to drive anything else. The Bronco handles very well, and has a tight turning radius. Driving the Bronco, makes you feel like your &quot;king of the road&quot;.

 When I bought it, it had 97,000 miles, but does not show it at all. The '93 bronco is the second year of the new body style, and just looks cool. My particular truck has an upgraded stereo system with a 10 disc Kenwood CD changer, and leather interior. The engine is the 302 cubic inch V-8, which gives the truck excellent pick up, and power. The truck also has a lighted running boards ( after market ), and a sun visor. I would recommend this Bronco to people who are looking for strong dependable SUV. People I would not recommend this to are people with families because it is only a 2-door vehicle, but if the rest of the family is willing to climb up into the spacious backseat, then it's not a problem.

Overall, I think this is the best SUV that Ford has produced, and it is a shame that it is not being produced anymore. When I bought my Bronco, people thought it was a new SUV, when it is actually 7 years old. This is why the Bronco is the &quot;forgotten SUV&quot;, and thats the way I like it!<br><br>
