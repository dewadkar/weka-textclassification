            I'm a car snob.  I like driving foreign cars.  So it was with more than a little trepidation I actually agreed to take a *gasp* Taurus at the rental car agency Christmas week.  But, like Mikey in the Life cereal commercials, I was pleasantly surprised!  This car is quite roomy -- took a ton of presents, luggage, plants and people and kept everyone quite comfortable.  Great backseat room for an elderly aunt who is used to having all the legroom she wants and without having to sacrifice the legroom of the person in the passenger seat.  Terrific heater (which, given how freezing cold it was, was a blessing AND a necessity!) got the car warm quickly -- and I actually had to turn it down relatively quickly because it was chugging out VERY warm air!  That's not something I expected!  The flip-up console in the front seat to hold drinks, tapes, etc. is exceptionally well designed -- and I love having the option of putting the extra person in the front seat if we're jamming people in cars to go somewhere!  Gas mileage was good as well.  Now the one I had from the rental car place had about 20,000 miles on it and was in good shape.  Last weekend I was given a fleet car to drive that was about 500 miles shy of 100,000 miles.  Same year car, too.  And guess what?  It was great!  The only thing I noticed that made me wonder was that the pickup between dead stop and first gear is a little slow.  In talking to the rental car guys I found out that this is common among Fords of all types (how would I know that?  I don't usually drive Fords!)  but it's certainly not erratic or difficult to deal with.  And the seats are VERY comfortable -- I spent most of the day tooling around in it a couple of times and found it very cozy. Guess I won't be asking for car-class upgrades to get away from Ford Tauruses anymore!

What would I change?  Seat heat for the front seat passengers (I warned you I was a car snob!).  And make the pickup from a dead stop a little better.  But realistically, I loved this car and it's going on my preferred rental list! <br><br>
