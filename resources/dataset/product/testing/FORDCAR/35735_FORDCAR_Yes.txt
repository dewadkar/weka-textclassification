            I purchased my first new car in 1997, a Ford Mustang GT. I still have it, and still love it. There have been no real problems to speak of, other than I have had to replace the tires once. However, that may be more of a testament to how I drive than the durability of the Goodyears. My car is still quick, powerful, and has that wonderful rumbling sound that knocks the doors off of anything with less than 8 cylinders. I keep it clean, and still get looks when driving by. It's a nice looking car. The seats aren't the most comfortable for long trips, and the back seat is definitely not for large people, but that's not the point of a Mustang. The Mustang is all about driving fun. It is about rolling down the windows, listening to the engine roar, and cruising in a legend. As long as you commit to maintaining the maintenence schedule (I would never let it go beyond 3,000 miles without and oil change), there's no reason to think that this classic American car won't perform as well as any old import. <br><br>
