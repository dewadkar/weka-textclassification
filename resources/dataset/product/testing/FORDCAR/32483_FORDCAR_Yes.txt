            I&#146ve always been a SUV-driving type of woman. My last vehicle was a 2-door1994 Ford Explorer. It wasn&#146t a 4x4, but it was still one of the best vehicles I&#146ve ever owned. 

Why buy a SUV if you aren&#146t going to purchase 4-wheel drive? I would, but I can never afford it. I also like the additional height that most of them have over standard cars. I suppose I could always get a minivan, but they're too slow and bulky and they scream &#147soccer mom&#148 to me. No offense to soccer moms but I&#146m going through a mid-life crisis here. 

Last February, it was time for a new one. I didn&#146t want a large sized SUV. They guzzle too much gas and I just don&#146t <i> need </i> all that room. I wanted a mid or small sized SUV. I also needed 4-doors this time. Mamma is getting older and I occasionally tote her elderly friends around, too. I could write a whole Epinion on the saga of extracting her elderly neighbor from the back seat of the Explorer. It was like the advertisement for the roach motel. <i>&#148They can crawl in, but they can&#146t crawl out.&#148</i> 

My favorite vehicle (appearance-wise) was the Nissan XTerra but it wasn&#146t rated very well in consumer reports. It was also terribly expensive. If I was going to pay that much, I might as well get another Explorer or perhaps a Toyota 4 Runner. The problem was, I had a budget of about $20,000 and every vehicle I wanted was totally out of my league.  

I test drove quite a few SUV&#146s that month. Since I&#146ve had such good luck with Fords and the Escape was rated fairly well, I decided to add this one to the list.  

My first Ford Escape test drive was in the XLS model. I didn&#146t care for this one at all. The front seats seemed cheap and it was also terribly noisy. I felt like I was in an old jeep, bouncing around. We went to another dealer and I was able to try out their next level, which was the Escape XLT.  They have one other level above this- The Limited, but this was just as expensive as the Explorer so why bother?  

I&#146ve been seeing these bright yellow SUV's all over the place lately and I wanted one! (once again, a mid-life crisis thing.) I wanted something sporty, young and cheerful. This is the only major objection Dear Husband had with me concerning my vehicle. He said yellow looks like a school bus and he didn&#146t want it. Since I&#146ve trumped him before on various vehicles he&#146s selected, I had to respect his decision on this one. 

Fortunately for him, the Escapes don&#146t come in yellow. They come in Aspen Green, Black, Dark Shadow Grey, Gold Ash, Oxford White, Redfire, Satin Silver, and True Blue. Since I&#146ve already had white and black vehicles (they get dirty fast), my next choice was Red. The only model they had on the lot was an XLT that came in Gold Ash. It looked more like champagne to me. Not unpleasant at all, but it wasn&#146t the splashy color I wanted, either. The interior is a color called &#147Medium Pebble&#148, or tan to me. 

The Escape XLT is <i>much</i> nicer than the XLS model I first tried. My vehicle came with a gray-black molding that covered the bottom half, giving it the sporty look I like.

It handles more like a car. In fact, it reminds me of my mother&#146s station wagon. Unfortunately, it drives a little bit like a station wagon, too. I guess I was used to my little Explorer that I could zip in and out of anywhere in an instant. This is a little bulky and I sometimes have trouble maneuvering it. This model (which I ended up purchasing) also didn&#146t have 4 X 4 capabilities. It is front wheel drive only.

This also came with optional step bars but if I had the choice, I wouldn&#146t have gotten them. I can see having them on a truck or large SUV but I don&#146t think this vehicle needs it. I&#146m 5&#146 6&#148 and all they do is trip me. I never needed them for the Explorer, either. 

My biggest complaint is that the front seat seems smaller. Not the leg room but in width. Even my 2-door Explorer had more room up front. The seats are not as plush as the Explorer but they're adequate. They're able to recline back far enough to make taking a nap comfortable. 

I find the front and rear wipers to be confusing to operate. They, along with the headlights are all on the left and right turn signals. I&#146ve had this vehicle for 11 months now and I still sometimes turn on the wrong thing. I was pleased to see an AM/FM radio with a 6-disc in-dash CD player. 

The back seat has ample leg room- certainly more than my Explorer did. The only thing I didn&#146t like was the rear head rests. I felt like they were blocking my view when I tried to back up. Since you have to take them out to put the seat down, I never bothered to put them back in. 

I find the cargo room to be adequate for my needs (grocery shopping and hauling small things) but it's not as large as the Explorer. 

My Escape has a 3.0 L, V6 Engine, which has plenty of pick up for this ex-ambulance driver! I do sometimes notice that the transmission has to catch up with me. I don't know if this is a flaw of this vehicle or if it's because I have a lead foot. I still think it acts sluggish in comparison to my little Explorer. 

We've just had our first major snow storm this year and this didn't perform as admirably as I had hoped. It has ample clearance, but it slid just like a regular car would have. 

My biggest gripe would probably have to do with the gas tank size. It's a 16 gallon tank. I don't know how big they normally are, but seem to be filling it up a lot more frequently than I did in the Explorer. This vehicle is listed as getting 19 MPG city and 25 MPG highway. 

I also chose to have a sunroof, security system and remote starter put in after purchasing this. 

Overall, this is a nice vehicle but I still wish I could have afforded another Explorer.
