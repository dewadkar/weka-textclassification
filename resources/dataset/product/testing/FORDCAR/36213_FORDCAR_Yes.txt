            I originally wanted a VW Jetta but due to bad experiences at the dealership I decided to try out the new Ford Focus.  I had seen it the day before for the first time and loved the sleek, straight back end of the car.  Since I am a fan of standard cars I decided to purchase a standard, 130 horsepower, black Ford Focus ZTS.  Let me tell you, this car has power and great acceleration.  I was pleasantly surprised.  All Ford Focus' come with CD player and the dashboard is visually pleasing.  Some neat features to this car are the windshield wipers which you can put on slow or fast and then there is a little dial numbered 1-6 which allows you to adjust the slow and faster to faster and slower.  Also, this car has keyless entry and on the key chain there is an option to push a little alarm that goes off for about 10 seconds so if, for example, you are being mugged you can push that button and set an alarm off.  Another great feature are the seats which can be adjusted up and down as well as front and back.  I think that this car would be great for just about anyone, except maybe the big family.  It seats 5 comfortably.  Truck space is of a pretty good size.  I recommend this car highly!<br><br>
