            SHOP AROUND BEFORE YOU BUY
Get the Saturday morning papers early and shop the loss
leaders from the dealers. Be prepared to get the run around
but if you stick to your guns you can get a great deal
I bought a New 2001 Loaded Eddie Bauer with Entertainment
rear parking control towing everything
List $40,800   I PAID $29,900
SHOP SHOP SHOP
This is the third Expedition we have owned
a 1997 1998 and now a 2001 Eddie Bauer
A few things influenced our purchase 
#1  Ford now included a lot of the luxury items
    from the Navigator. The auto climate control,
    the power pedal assembly, Rear distance warning
    and memory seats to name a few
#2  Ford came out with the rear entertainment system
    for $1300 and then make it free as a promotion
#3  Ford brought out a $2000 rebate

Overall I like this truck and having put over 60,000 miles
on our last two am fairly confident in its overall reliability. They still haven�t addressed its few bad characteristics.
The luggage area with the 3rd seat in place is not large enough
Access to the 3rd seat is hard and requires you to climb over the middle seat
The standard 17" tires and suspension package aren�t
up to the task 
No rear speakers for the 3rd seat passengers which means
making the sound too loud for everyone else so they can hear
