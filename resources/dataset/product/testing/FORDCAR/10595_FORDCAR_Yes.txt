            Every family needs a truck at one point or another. My family has personally retired four trucks in the last 8 years. When shopping, we look for something that gets good gas mileage, requires low maintenance, and is comfortable to ride in. We've had a Chevy, a Dodge, and a GMC, but once we got our first Ford, we found out what driving a truck is all about. The Ranger has a good size bed for hauling, a strong enough motor to tow just about anything, and all the amenities you get from a car. Ranger's with the extra cab and jump seats are especially nice for families with young children. 
Part and repair on the Ranger are very reasonable (not that I have had to repair anything). My truck gets about 22 miles to the gallon, which is good for a truck. 
Being a woman, I am always looking for a reliable car. I don't want to deal with repair work. I want to feel protected even in a small truck. I want to know that I won't break down in the middle of no where at night. In my Ranger, I have all the securities I am looking for. It has duel air bags, with a shut off switch for the passengers side. Adjustable shoulder belts allow anyone to wear the seat belt comfortably. Anti-Lock Breaks allow me to drive the California Freeways without fear. 
Reasonable price and easy on the insurance, the Ford Ranger is the best small truck on the market.
