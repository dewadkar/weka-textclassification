<TEXT>
            I bought my 5-speed 1994 ford probe with 138,000 miles for $3,100  at a dealership and I haven't had any real problems so far, I have only had to change the timing belt right after I bought it.

SPEED
The probe is very quick off the start but starts to lose power higher in the gears, but with only 118 hp it realy gets going.

GAS MILEAGE
It gets pretty good gas mileage and is supposed to be about 28 mpg in town however it seems I get a little less than that.

NOISES
Very quiet car with very little annoying sounds. Sometimes air leaks through and windows and I can tell there are a few loose screws in a couple of places but for the most part its very quiet.

CORNERING
Because of how high the probe is from the ground corning is not the greatest and theres a huge gap between the tire and the car, my friends tell me to lower the car almost everyday but atleast the probe doesnt scrape on every curb.

ROOM
I am 5'5 so fitting in side the probe is very easy however my friends which are all most 6 feet or taller complain about how small it is in the back seat (the front seat is fine). The only problem I have is the huge steering wheel that makes me have to slide in and out of my car.

AUTOMATIC VS. 5-SPEED
I have heard very bad things about automatic probes but I have never driven one before I still do not recomend buying an automatic probe.

SOUND QUALITY
Stock speakers are not that great if you like loud music but they are very easy to change only a couple of screws and since its a hatchback there is alot of room for upgrading your sound.

PAINT
The paint looks good but chips off very easy, everytime I wash my car I find one or two more chips  in the paint which really sucks.

INTERIOR
The interior looks good but there is no cup holder or handles and sometimes seems a little cramped.

BUMPS
I think I need new springs because it can get pretty bumpy.

DURABILITY
This probe has been through alot with 175,000 and probaly still has alot of life left.

LOOKS
I really like the way probes look and so do teachers that work with, they say it looks like a sports car.
