            On a recent vacation to the Florida keys, we needed a LARGE vehicle to carry the 10 of us down their plus our gear.  Well, the kind lady at the Budget Rent-a-car Counter showed us to our vehicle...a brand new 15 passenger Club Wagon.  At first, the shear size of this thing was daunting but we managed to get ourselves and all of our luggage inside and then some.

Once underway, it became apparent that this van was going to be much easier to drive than it appears.  With front and rear A/C, killer stereo, dark tinted windows, cruise control, power everything AND a diesel engine, this was gonna become our new favorite cruisemobile!

It returned an average of 15 MPG on mostly highway driving, which was commendable considering the pace that we maintained on the interstates.  It really was not affected much by cross-winds or passing tractor trailers.  The ride was smooth and it took bumps well.

After three days with this van, I was sorry to have to return it.  It's sheer girth commanded a new respect from other drivers.  Other than having to learn to bypass smaller parking places, I could live with this vehicle on a daily basis...if I had a platinum gas card.  Filling up cost nearly 62 dollars!!!!  However, if we had chosen the rental companies nice offer of filling it for us, it would have been even more.

Rent one, pile in your friends and have fun!!!<br><br>
