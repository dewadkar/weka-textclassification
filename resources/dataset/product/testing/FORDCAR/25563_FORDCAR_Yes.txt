            I traded my 1988 Toyota 4 X 4 in when I purchased my Sport Trac.  I was used to the small truck bed and found that I was not handicapped in hauling the things I need.  With the cargo extender my cargo is secure and for longer loads I can move out to the tailgate or remove the extender with ease.  My wife likes the simplicity of placing the groceries in the back knowing that they will not be rolling all around the truck bed.  The tonneau cover adds to the security.  It is strong and convenient.  Easily removed for larger bulky items.

The ride is comfortable, roomy and offers great visibility.  The rear window can be lowered with the touch of a button.  Likewise, it can be lowered or raised fully with one turn of that button.  The back seats are easy to access.  That is one of the reasons I bought this model.  I transport elderly people quite often.  They like to stretch out their legs (knee surgery) and the fact that their bottoms are not sitting on the drive shaft.

While some have criticized the mileage, the noise, and the appearance, this vehicle is just what I want.  The road noise is not unlike any other auto.  The mileage compares favorably with other trucks/SUVs.  And as far as the looks are concerned, it is a smart package.  

My one complaint might be that the automatic transmission accelerates seemed slow at start up.  This is probably due to the fact that I was driving it too much like a stick shift. Once moving the Sport Trac hums.
