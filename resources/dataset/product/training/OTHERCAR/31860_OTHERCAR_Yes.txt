            I love the huge LCD display & the compactness of the Casio Exilim EX-Z4U camera & 4Mpixels all for just ï¿½265. I really like the cradle it sits in for charging & USB connection & it can run for much longer between charges than the Sony. 

I bought the Casio with the intention of comparing it to my Sony DSC-P5 3.2Meg pixel camera & then keeping the one I liked most. The Casio Exilim Z4 beats the Sony on just about everything except what really counts & that is picture quality ! 

Graininess was more apparent when zooming on Casio images on PC & they seem to be a little noisy with slight blotches and perhaps because the colours seem unnaturally bright the pixelation seems more apparent than on the Sony, even though the Casio has slightly more pixels. Zooming in on an image on PC of a plain blue shirt almost gave the appearance of a checkered pattern with the Casio while on the Sony the colour tone remained smoother & more natural. 

I only use optical zoom as digital zoom reduces the number of pixels used. However when you switch off the Casio digital zoom it only remains disabled until you switch the camera off then on again which is irritating.
 
For someone less fussy than me about image quality the Casio is an excellent high quality super compact easy to use snapshot camera & I am torn between the two cameras becuase the Casio has so much going for it but much as I like its huge LCD screen & compactness I shall be returning it much to my dismay. I prefer the image quality of the Sony even if it does have an irritating silly little LCD screen.
