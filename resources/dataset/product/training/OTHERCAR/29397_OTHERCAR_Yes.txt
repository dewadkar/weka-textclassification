            For some reason (to me) Infinitis dont get near the respect they deserve. At the moment they are not held at the pinnacle that other luxury cars are. The infiniti provides a sleek design and a beautiful ride. I survived a six hour ride in a Q45 one time. Thats a lot for a car. 

The Q45 is silent, the motor purrs with each tap of the accelerator. When you talk about BMW, Mercedes, and Jaguar, without a doubt the Infiniti deserves to be there as well.

The price tag is lower than most in its class, yet it drives better than many BMW's I have ridden in. If you are in the hunt for a car of this calibur, and are sick of seeing millions of BMWs on the road, the Infiniti is for you. Original, sleek, and fun. <br><br>
