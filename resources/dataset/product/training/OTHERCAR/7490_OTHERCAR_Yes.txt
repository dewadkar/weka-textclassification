            When my Toyota Camry was repossessed (thanks to the ex-husband) I needed to find another vehicle and FAST!!  You see, I had planned a trip to visit my boyfriend for a few months and now had no vehicle to get there. 
I had no idea what  type of vehicle I wanted, let alone what kind I could afford.  
I visited a local dealer  who not only had several makes and models of cars but would also work with me and my less than perfect credit.  My mother is currently driving a Dodge Intrepid and loves it, so I started looking at Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth products.  The used car dealer had several Breezes and Stratus'.
The representative attempted to sell me a newer vehicle (1999 Suzuki Esteem) however, due to having 2 children, one in a car seat, I felt I needed a bigger vehicle.
She then showed me a few others but I liked the look of the Stratus and kept referring her back to that model and what needed to happen for me to purchase one.
I drove a 1997 Dodge Stratus ES that was equipped with all the &quot;whistles and bells&quot;, i.e. air conditioning, cruise control, power seats, power windows and velour interior. The interior is luxurious and comfortable.  The seats hug your back and adjust to height. On the trip from Maine to Virginia and back, I never once had any back pain or difficulty with siatica which I have experience in other vehicles I have owned.
The Stratus ES also had a V6 with overdrive and came with an auto-stick.  On the open highway, I have both a smooth ride and  all the power of a V6.  I also like the fact that the controls are all within reach for the driver.  
I love the feel, the ride and the handling of the Stratus.  The feel is luxurious, the ride is smooth as silk and the handling can't be beat.  I have yet to drive in the snow here in Maine but I love what I have experienced so far in driving the Stratus.  My boyfriend also drove the Stratus while in Virginia and he was impressed with both the handling and the smoothness of the car.
I have no idea what the Stratus ES costs new but I paid $10,000 for my Stratus ES that had 44,000.  I would recommend anyone to at least give this car a test drive and see what you think. There is nothing about this car that I dislike.  If gas prices would come down, I would absolutely love this car.  To fill this beast up, it costs about $25.00 (I'm usually on the gas lite). If I was recommending this vehicle to a friend, I would strongly encourage him/her to buy one.
