            For $499, this is one excellent camera.

The camera couldn't be easier to use. Within an hour after purchase, the included software was installed, and I was viewing my first pictures in the PictureEasy Software. The camera can be connected either via serial or USB ports.

The camera has been a huge hit at family parties. Since it can be connected to a TV to view the pictures, everyone really enjoys watching the &quot;slideshow&quot; at the end of the day.  

Since there is not film or developing to worry about, I find myself taking the camera along on many day-to-day events that I never would have before. My friends and I really have come to enjoy having memories of these &quot;non-special&quot; days captured.  The pictures are easily saved in an on-line photo album, for easy viewing or printing at a later date.  Plus, they can be emailed to anyone with a quick drag of the mouse.

Picture quality is excellent, even when the pictures are produced and printed by a professional service.

Overall, an excellent product!<br><br>
