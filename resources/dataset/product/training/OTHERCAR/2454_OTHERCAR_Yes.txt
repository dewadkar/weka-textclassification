            Overall this is the best vehicle I have ever owned.  It has a very powerful V6 which also has a dealer optional supercharger!  Naturally aspirated I can get this truck to up and go faster than most of the compact "boy racers" out there.  I use this vehicle for recreational offroading and it continues to amaze me.  Heavy snow is also common where I live and it muscles through it better than the full size trucks that I pass who are stuck on the side =).  I have also driven two seperate, 18 hour, 1 day trips in this vehicle.  I am 6'2" and the drive was above average.  I have made more trips for warranty work than needed because the dealer I took it to repaired it incorrectly.  The initial repair was caused by me "testing its limits" which I might add, are very high.  I did not choose the TRD option because I have aftermarket goals for this truck.  The non-TRD axle is larger and has more applications for aftermarket traction control devices. The interior is satisfactory, but for a truck, it looks very nice.  Like with most trucks, there are some dash rattles and squeeks that can be cured with a little foam and some digging around.  Also, the exterior style is great, and allows for lots of aftermarket offroading additions like sliders and bull bars.
