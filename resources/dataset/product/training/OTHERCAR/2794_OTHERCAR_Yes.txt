While more than a year old - it came out in early 1998 - the Olympus D-340L has been one of the better buys I've made in the last two years.  The image quality is impressive, with color handling that matches any similarlly priced standard hand held camera.  The cameras high-quality function (a resolution of 1024/768) makes for fantastic prints when coupled with Epsons photo-quality glossy paper.

Connecting the camera to your computer or your TV is also easy, with all of the connections housed on one side of the camera.

On the negative side, the Camera's computer based software is quirky and very slow.  The images are also compressed with a propriatary form of JPEG, meaning that they should be resaved once they are downloaded to your machine (opening them directly opens the Camera software, which then searches for the Camera - a process that takes roughly a minute).  My problems with the software may have been caused by my use of a Macintosh, but I can't be sure.

All in all, while the software does have its drawbacks, the quality of the images makes up for them.<p>
