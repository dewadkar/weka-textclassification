            I believe that the Polaroid PhotoMax PDC-640 is an excellent beginner digital camera.  For starters, the price was right, only $180 at Super WalMart.  This camera uses the standardized SmartMedia memory diskettes.  The nice thing about using these memory cards is that you could use them in many other hardware items as well as your next camera.  The only drawback memory wise is that the largest card it can handle is 8 megs.  (cards come as large as 16 or 32 that I have seen)  This camera does not have very good resolution (640 X 480), so resizing can loose some clarity.  The customer service provided by Polaroid was outstanding.  Another drawback is that it requires 2 AA batteries.  This camera will use batteries rather quickly, about 2 batteries per 100 pictures.  It also has a port for connecting it to your television.  You can then review or show photos on the television screen.  The complete package comes with the camera, serial cable for retrieving photos, power cable for plugging into the wall, photo editing software, 2 meg memory card (about 12 pictures at high resolution), tv connection cable, carrying case, and alot of help books.

I think that this camera makes an excellent first digital camera for its price. <br><br>
