            This is my second digital camera, the first being a Kodak DC 290.  The Kodak takes great pictures, but it's big and not very cute.

The Finepix 6800 is cute....all of my friends that have seen it so far have said they have to have one.  The alloy body leaves the impression that it would afford good protection.  I especially like the way the lens retracts into the camera case and is concealed by an automatic lens cover after turning the camera off.  A big plus for me is the size.  I was looking for a great camera with a size that would easily fit in my shirt pocket....the 6800 fills the bill.

Of all the cameras that I have owned, the Finepix is the easiest to operate.  the function dial easily allows the user to change from stills to video to voice recording, etc. by a quick turn of the dial.

I did have a few problem initially, due to the fact that the instruction manual did not tell me that I had to have the camera in the "view" mode for adjustment of some of the functions, and in the "picture" mode to adjust the other functions.  The camera's software allows the user to quickly e-mail m-peg movies, allows voice-overs of the stills, and the option to caption individual pictures.

The camera's cradle plugs into your computer via USB port to give you quick downloads to the finepix viewer.  Leaving the camera in the cradle also keeps your battery fully charged. The charge function turns off automatically after completing its task.

Now that I have learned how to use all of the camera's abilities, I have found that it is both simple to use and simple to show others how to use the camera in only a few minutes.

I think I have found a camera that I will have in my pocket for a long time to come.
