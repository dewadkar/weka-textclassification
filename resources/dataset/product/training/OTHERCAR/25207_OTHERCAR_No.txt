            I inherited a '92 Legacy L in 1996 when it had about 50,000 miles on it.  My grandfather was religious about oil changes, rotating tires and regular maintenance, and the car seemed to be in really nice condition when I got it.  I therefore assumed the car would be a &quot;keeper&quot;.  Now I regret getting rid of my Ford and keeping this one.
I've had this car back to the mechanic (at a Subaru authorized garage) numerous times.  There was a problem with the alignment and the car always pulls to the right.  Next it was a trip to the body shop to have the front two &quot;fender&quot; panels replaced, as it had bad cancer (even though I washed and waxed it many, many times).  The windshield wiper motor conked out, in a rain storm!  That was a $300 bill to replace it.  The constant problem with the alignment (even though I've had it re-aligned 4 times) has caused me to have to replace tires more often than is normal.  Over a year ago the car started to make a rattle noise....back to the shop.  Evidently the heat shield, which I'm told sits between the exhaust system and the floor of the car, came loose and had to be bolted.  The &quot;rattling&quot; noise started again....back to the shop.  This time it was the right front axle.  The passive restraint on the driver side seized and would cost about $175 to fix, but I'm not having it done.  The driver side visor snapped.  Now I know things happen to cars, but I've been driving for over 19 years and have owned 4 cars.  Never have I had these problems.  I'm a safe, cautious and mindful driver and car owner.  I check the oil, tire pressure, wash the car and believe in &quot;scheduled&quot; maintenance, so I don't think I in any way contributed to the problems I've experienced.
On the plus side, the Legacy does handle very well in the snow and bad weather and it does get good gas mileage (being in the shop so much it's hard to run out of gas!) <br><br>
