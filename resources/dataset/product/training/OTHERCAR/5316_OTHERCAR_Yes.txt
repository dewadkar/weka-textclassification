            This is the best car I have ever owned. I chose Honda primarily because of their reliability and repair record, but this model is also great to drive. The V6 is 200hp and drives much more smoothly than the V4 version. It's gas mileage is slightly less, but I think the extra power and smooth ride is worth it. The Accord has more of a road feel than a Camry-- i.e. in the Camry, there is more of a floating feeling and in the Honda, you can feel the bumps. The leather interior in the EX is great and the car has all the features you would want-- sun roof, CD player, automatic windows and locks, alarm system, and even a built in remote garage door opener. One complaint I have about the car is the stereo. It does not have a cassette player and the volume control increases in jumps so that it seems that the radio is either too quiet or too loud-- you can't subtly adjust the volume. I also have had problems with the paint. Even a little scratch will chip a good amount of paint off, and it is hard to touch up. Overall, the radio volume and the paint problems are a small price to pay relative to the benefits of this car.<br><br>
