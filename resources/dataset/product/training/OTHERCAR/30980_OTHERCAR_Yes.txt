            When I decided I wanted a new car, I started my search at BMW and Mercedes dealers.  I had driven a Park Avenue for 10 years and this time I wanted a luxury sports convertible that would be fun, but solid and safe. Remember I hadn't been car shopping for 10 years.  Talk about sticker shock!

I did my homework, looked at hundreds of cars and still couldn't find the one that filled my needs.  My son, who also owns a Trans Am, suggested I look at Camaros and/or Firebirds.  After test driving both, my choice was overwhelmingly Pontiac Trans Am.  It gives me the speed and exhilaration of a sports car,  but it also offers the feeling of solid safety that the Z3 Roadster and Miata didn't.  I bought a T-Top in lieu of the convertible for two reasons:  the first being that when the top was up the side vision was blocked significantly by the canvas and in Phoenix, you need to see everything, cause people don't watch for you.  The second reason was price - $8000 more for the convertible.  When the T-Tops are removed, you still have the convertible feel with a bit more safety.  At $24K, this car gave me value for the dollar.

The car handles like a dream, hugs the road and passes quickly when I hit the accelerator.  The latter is important on two lane highways where semi-trucks and Motor homes seem to gather in small convoys.  Passing on  mountain roads isn't the time to find out whether your car has the &quot;poop&quot; to get around slower vehicles.  With the Trans Am, I don't have to worry.  The only problem is that it drives so smoothly you can reach 90/100 mph before you realize how fast you are going.  Not good if radar is pointed in your direction!

The cabin of the T/A is comfortable with surprising leg and head room.  The driver's seat has electronic controls to get the optimum driving position for anyone - tall or short.  All my sons are over 6 ft., but my husband and I are 5'8&quot; and my legs are longer than his.  We can all drive this car in comfort.  The sound system (10 speakers) is terrific and dropping the back seat gives us extra cargo space when needed.  However, I wouldn't recommend putting adults in the back seat for any extended period of time.  As with most sports cars, the back seat is for kids and insurance purposes.  There aren't too many options to buy, this car comes pretty loaded with standards, including leather seats.  Gas mileage is pretty good - I usually get 23-25 miles per gallon.

As the title of my review states, this car appeals to all ages.  I'm a female business professional over 50 and my sons are in their late twenties/early thirties.  My new daughter-in-law just bought a T/A as well, so there are now three in our family.  Pontiac is obviously doing something right.<br><br>
