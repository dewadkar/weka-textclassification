            I bought my '96 Sportage 5 speed, 4WD new about 4 years ago because I needed a 4 door vehicle (I had a 2 door Civic) with some cargo handling space but didn't want to pay a fortune and didn't want to buy a battleship sized SUV or van. The Sportage satisfied these needs and I've been happy ever since. 

Of course, I would be happier with better gas mileage - I seem to get 22 MPG almost constantly - in town, on the road, with the AC on or off. I guess I was spoiled by the 40 MPG I got on the Civic. 

The original radio/cassette had to be replaced the first week but that really is the extent of the problems I've had in 4 years and almost 50,000 miles. Well, maybe one more - sometimes in the morning, before the car has warmed up, shifting is difficult. I had the dealer look at it, but they found nothing wrong. It really hasn't been too difficult to live with. 

I rarely, if ever, use the 4WD - probably like most SUV owners - but the few times I did, it worked very well - good traction, easy handling. I have to tell you that I recommended this vehicle to my daughter's friend and she got a lemon - even went to arbitration with Kia and after fixing the existing problems, they gave her the car free for 2 years (it was leased).

I love to drive my Sportage - it's high off the ground for good visibility and very comfortable and no problem seating 5. It's small enough to park and maneuver easily. 

I also have been happy with the few experiences I've had with the Kia dealer and recently recommended them to my sister - she bought a Sephia since she didn't want or need an SUV - and she's been very happy so far. I have to admit that I was a little skeptical and scared at first - I thought I might be buying a Korean Yugo - but I've been turned around. I might not buy another Sportage because I really don't need an SUV - but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone and certainly, I would buy another Kia - maybe next time a sedan.<br><br>
