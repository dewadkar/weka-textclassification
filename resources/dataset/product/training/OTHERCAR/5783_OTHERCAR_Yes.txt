            I have purchased, used, and trained non-technical people on three of these cameras.  They are very easy to use - the basics only requiring about five minutes of instruction.  The level of knowledge needed is comparable to any 35mm point and shoot camera.  And the quality of the pictures is exceptional.

One friend sells on eBay and she saw a drastic increase in the final bids immediately after starting to use this camera.

The only negative is that on 'auto' the flash doesn't always judge correctly for what you want your subject to be - especially if you off-center the subject.  I compensate for this by manually turning the flash on - in most circumstances, this works great.

One recommendation I have is to buy a 6 volt ac adapter from radio shack and only turn on the back LCD display when connected to AC power.  This one action will allow you to take hundreds of pictures on one set of batteries - I probably took 600 pictures at the lowest resolution on the first set of batteries that came with the camera.  I would not recommend the Olympus branded AC adapter.  It cost me $49.95, whereas one from radio shack was under $12, and works just the same (6v, tip positive).

All in all, this is definitely the camera I recommend to anyone wanting to start using digital photography.<br><br>
