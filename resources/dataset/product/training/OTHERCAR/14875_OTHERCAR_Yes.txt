            This has got to be the best camera I have ever owned!  I had been nagging my husband to get me a digital camera for a very long time!  We had bought one a few years back that we ended up taking back because the quality of the picture on the computer was just awful!

A few months back, we took a trip to Disney World with my family.  My brothers both had this Sony camera.  I was totally impressed with it from the minute I saw it!  One of the main things I really like about this camera is that it stores the pictures on a disk.  It's doesn't need a memory card like most of the digital cameras.  Another feature that really caught my eye was the fact that the camera automatically knows when to use and when not to use a flash when I take the picture.  And the picture turns out beautiful every single time, unless of course the subject is moving around..  (like my kids)  It's hard to get them to stand still for a picture!

Another feature is automatic focus.  As long as what you are taking a picture of remains still, the camera will automatically focus the picture for a clear picture every single time!  Yet another feature is once your disk is full, you can play back the pictures on it to see if you want to keep it or not.  If the picture didn't turn out, you can delete it off the disk while the disk is still in the camera...  Frees up disk space immediately!  

The final feature is the one that really blows me away.  You are able to record up to sixty seconds of moving video.  I have never ever known a camera to record moving video!  Once you take still or moving pictures, all you need to do is pop the disk in the computer and pull up the pictures on your screen!

Fantastic camera! I can't say enough good things about it!  If you are in the market for a digital camera, this is the one to buy!
