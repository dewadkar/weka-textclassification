            I absolutely love my &quot;millenium silver&quot; 1999 Toyota 4Runner.  My wife will definitely attest to that (I've even named the car, for goodness sake!).  Seriously, it is one of the best investments I've ever made.
I'd never had a new car before the 4Runner, and that was specifically my goal: to take such good care of a new car, that I wouldn't inherit any of the abuse from previous owners I always had in the past.  SO, for the last 14 months, I've been using it to its full extent (mud, snow, lots of 4WD time) AND keeping it in tip-top shape, and it has performed like a champ in every way.
Performance-wise, it's improved with age, so to speak.  It drives smoothly and quietly (I'm very sensitive to road noise, as my last car was a ragtop Mustang convertible that nearly deafened me every time I drove above 50mph) in almost every condition imaginable.  I must admit, I've only 4 wheeled it in the mud once, but that was fun as hell. In the snow, I was really impressed.  I didn't even have to go into low 4WD mode to get superior control  at @ 45 mph.  And even driving through a snowstorm with snow and ice on the ground, my 4Runner performed as if it was on a dry cement road.  Literally, I was almost <i>trying</i> to see if it would swerve or jerk with a little steering wheel movement, but it was totally solid.
I happen to work about ten miles off a freeway, down an extremely windy and non-lit road.  This road happens to be infested with deer and other forms of wildlife, which results in many accidents every year.  Now, when it's even the least bit rainy, I slip the 'ol truck into high 4WD mode, and hug the turns like it 'aint no thing.  Throw in the great headlight coverage, and I'm good to go, feeling safe at all times.
Many people feel that the down side of SUV's is the mileage-take it from someone who used to drive a Mustang, it could be worse.  But seriously, the mileage isn't great.  But that's not why I bought the truck.  I bought it for all of the above reasons, and it's been more than I hoped for.  I hope to drive this truck for at least ten years.
Throw into the mix that I got a phenomenal deal--fully loaded SR5 with leather, sun roof, trailer pack, etc--for $30,000 out the door.  Not to mention that my particular model, the 1999 loaded SR5 in Millenium Silver was hard to come by, so that made me feel pretty good.
What's that, you say?  What's my truck named?  Yeah, right.  I've written enough already...<br><br>
