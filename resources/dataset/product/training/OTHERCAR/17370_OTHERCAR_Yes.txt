            SOME PICKUP OWNERS think of their trucks as sports cars with cargo boxes and, to them, a four-passenger pickup probably seems akin to a four-door Corvette.


But an extended cab model makes sense for those who sometimes need some extra seating or who want lots of sheltered storage space without installing a cap.


Costing about $1,200 more than a comparable regular-cab model, the Xtracab is one of a range of pickups from Toyota. They're available in rear-wheel drive or with either of two four-wheel drive systems, with standard and long beds and with luxury options that include compact disc players and sunroofs.


And they can get expensive - our test truck, a '91, listed for more than $16,000, with air conditioning ($710) a bed liner ($327) and a compact disc player ($446). (Four-wheel drive adds about $1,700. We recommend it in this part of the country; small pickups with only rear-wheel-drive are no fun to drive in snow.)


Xtracab models have standard sized beds, but are, overall, almost 19 inches longer than standard cab/standard bed models.


An Xtracab in the higher SR5 equipment level includes jumpseats in the cab's rear; they have combination lap and shoulder belts; and their bottoms fold up to increase cargo room and expose two covered storage bins for keeping small valuables like a camera or tools.


Otherwise, the Xtracab is pretty typical of compact pickups, offering ruggedness and a youthful, fun-to-drive personality but a ride jouncier than that of almost any passenger car. Handling is capable except for overly assisted power steering and a tendency of the rear tires to cha cha over bumps when the bed is empty - two characteristics common to small pickups.


Like those in most trucks, our test Toyota's stick shift was serviceable but not as good as the best units available nowadays in cars. Automatic transmission costs $720 in four-cylinder models, $900 in versions with an optional V-6 engine.


That engine produces 150 horsepower. It costs $1,060 and more to run because it delivers about two less miles per gallon of gas than the four-cylinder engine.


All versions of Toyota's pickups are available with rear-wheel antilock brakes; some have them as standard equipment. It's another option we'd recommend because of the ease with which a pickup's rear brakes can lock on wet pavement.


One more note: Toyota pickups will be little changed for 1992 and you'll save some money opting for a leftover '91. The '92 price in the accompanying box is about $600 higher than that of 1991.
