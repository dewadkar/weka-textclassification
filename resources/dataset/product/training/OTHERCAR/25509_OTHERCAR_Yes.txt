            After researching light trucks and subsequently test driving various makes, I decided that the best of the light trucks was going to be the Mazda/Ford. With that in mind I went shopping and found that a similarly equipped Mazda would be quite a bit cheaper than the Ford. (At least in this market.)
Anyway, bought 1997 Mazda B4000 SE(looks like the picture on this site) with automatic for $13,900. Closest I could come with the Ford was the 4cyl Ranger auto for $16,200.
Vehicle has been extremely reliable, not a single misstep in going on 3 years. Only problem I have had was that the front wheels were probably misaligned when I bought the truck and after about 12,000 miles the front tires were pretty goobered up. The fellow at the tire center said that these trucks(Ford and Mazda) are notorious for this and he recommended alignments with the oil changes. Seemed a little excessive to me. I've got about 8000 on the new front tires with no problems apparent.

It rides well for a truck. Pavement irregularities are handled well. Only ride complaint is turning sharply right into my sloped driveway seems to take all the travel out of the front end and you could lose a tooth if you weren't prepared.

I've only gotten about 17 mpg since new and it didn't get any better after break in. But since, it's more of a weekend handyman truck, that's acceptable. Engine, while thirsty, is very strong and the automatic fits well with this drivetrain. Very smooth. Brakes are excellent.

Nits to pick: 
Seats are very comfortable but the fabric felt loose. Seemed as I slid in and out, the seams on the seat would catch the seams on my trousers and would pull and pop loose. Bought some custom sheepskins and that fixed that. 
Wish a cruise control and a CD player came standard, other than that, just a good ol' truck. Had I waited a year, the back door was an option that I would recommend to anyone considering this truck.
I would recommend one to a friend. <br><br>
