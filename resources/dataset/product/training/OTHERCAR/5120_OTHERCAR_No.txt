            This is an ok car.  There are some good things such as the power and the room. We bought this car in 1994 because we knew someone at Chrysler.  There are also many bad things such as build quality, reliability and the ride.  

However there also good things such as the power from the 3.5 litre engine that produces a hearty 215 Hp.  This propels the 3400-pound Intrepid 0-60 in about 7.5 seconds.  The downside is 18/27 fuel mileage.  The room in the Intrepid is impressive.  Evens with the seats shoved back all the way there is plenty of legroom for 6-footers.  There is also plenty of shoulder room for 3 people.  The seats are also mighty comfy even the middle one in the back seat. 

Now to all the bad stuff such as the rattles, reliability, and stiff ride.  The car has limited soundproofing because it is really noisy on the highway mostly from the road.  This car also has a lot of rattles that come and go.  The car has been fixed many times for air conditing, brakes etc. The ride in this car is stiff and not very comfortable.  This car is similar to the Chrysler Concorde, and Eagle Vision.  The Vision and Concorde both have softer suspensions.  In the Intrepid you can really hear and feel the road.  If you put the bad aside it is a fairly good car with lots of room and power while being somewhat sporty.  I would recommend this car to people who don't mind squeaks, unreliability, firm ride and lots of noise.
