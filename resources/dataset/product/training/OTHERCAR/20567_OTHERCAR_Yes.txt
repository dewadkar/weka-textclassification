            This is my second Acura Coupe (1997, 1999) and the fourth in my family. I love them. My next Acura will likely be a sedan.  I like the energy and pep of the car. I find it very easy to drive for very short women like I am. Handability is great. It has carefully controlled me out of some dangerous weather related driving conditions. Maintenance has been very minimal. The car place I go to is easily able to get parts and never a delay because of it. I just love my acura.<br><br>
