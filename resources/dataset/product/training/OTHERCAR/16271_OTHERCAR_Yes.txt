            I recommend this car as an economical, family car. It gives a mileage of about 34 mpg and performs reliably. I have driven one for the past one year without any repairs at all - the only expense is the scheduled maintenance and the fuel (undoubtedly). 
I have clocked over 24500 miles in one year and driven long distances without any grievances.
It has excellent features as courtesy lights, auto headlights, seats are comfortable for stress free driving and has an excellent stereo system and plush carpeting all of which come standard. 
The drive is comfortable and engine is silent. Hardly any wind noise. If going uphill at high speeds (75 mph) the engine shifts in to second gear which actually exceeds the settings recommended by Toyota and one should immediately decrease the speed to under 70 mph. A tachometer as standard feature would have been good.
The car comes in 3 versions: VE-has poor gear ratio settings and least features for the money. CE-economical with all features as compared to the higher version except the rear view mirrors are mechanical.LE expensive for features provided.
Highly recommend the CE with automatic gears and power doors, windows etc.
