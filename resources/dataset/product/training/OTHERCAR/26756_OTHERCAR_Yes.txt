            I am a Chemistry teacher at the high school level, and have been looking for a good digital camera for school. I heard about the olympus D-360L from a friend and was able to purchase it through our school.  The nice thing about this camera is that right out of the box you can start using it.  It very user friendly and takes great pictures.  I especially like the zoom feature for close-ups, the burst mode for taking action shots in class and the panoramic mode.  With the 8mb smartmedia card you can take over 120 pictures before having to download any, thats very handy.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to get their first digital camera, because it will probably be your last.<br><br>
