            My wife and I have had the 2000 Z3 2.3 for 2 months and 4500 miles now. It has been to the dealer 2 times for warranty work: top leaks at seal with window, noise panel above pedals came loose (2 times), power convertible top would not go up, windshield pillar cover broken, shift knob loose. Also the engine will hang up for 1 to 3 seconds when up-shifting (5 speed), this does not happen consistently but is very annoying. Dealer said it only happens with the 2.3 model and is designed in. Leather seats not overly supportive (highly recommend extra $$$ for sport seats) but comfortable for 2 or 3 hours. Car handles great and steering response could not be better, had a 92 Miata that was more responsive but at high speeds was not as stable. Would not get 2.3 model again but would opt for M Roadster. Lined convertible top on 2000 models is a definite plus, as is the 36000 miles of free scheduled maintenance.<br><br>
