            I purchased the car used from an Infiniti dealer in Feb. 1994.  It has 45,000 miles on it and it currently has 91,000 miles.  I purchased the 7 yr. 100,000 mile warranty.

My primary motivation was the 278 HP engine and Japanese quality.  For the most part, I have not been disappointed.

Styling: although controversial when released, the car still fits in well today 10 yrs. after introduction.  The styling is clean and beautiful, and if you removed the front emblem would be a bit better looking.  Many cars, from the mid 90's Crown Victorias to the Old Aurora and many current cars have taken styling cues from this car.

Interior: The interior is comfortable for any range of trip and has held up extremely well.

Performance:  The acceleration puts most cars to shame and the handling is excellent for this size car.  I accelerate at full speed often and is a joy to drive.

Mechanics:  The transmission was rebuilt under warranty at 72,000 miles as well as some belts and hoses and rear shocks.  After warranty I have replaced power steering hoses and other monor items.  Expect to pay double for all repairs at the Infiniti dealer, although service is good.

For the money, a dependable, fast 4 door sports cars with above average dependability.  The car has no significant rattles or problems which shows well for the overall quality of the car.<br><br>
