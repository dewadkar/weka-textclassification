            My family has had a 1987 Integra since 1988. In that time we have put 235,000 miles on it. The amazing thing is that it still runs great and has had no substantial problems. We were going to sell it about a year ago, but we changed our minds when a mechanic said that it was in great shape.

After twelve years, the car might not be pretty to look at, but it has been the most reliable car that my family has ever bought. It doesn't perform as well as it used to, but it outperforms many other newer cars that I have driven.

My sister drove this car for a few years, and loved it so much that she bought a brand new Integra last year. Her new car has 30,000 miles on it now and performs beautifully. It is definitely worth the price. 

From my experience with Integras, I would recommend this car to anybody. It is not an incredibly expensive car, it is fast, reliable, and inexpensive to maintain. If you are in the market for a new car, you should definitely check these cars out.<br><br>
