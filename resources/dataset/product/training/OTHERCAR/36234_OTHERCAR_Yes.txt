            We bought a brand new Galant in 1991 and I thought I was on cloud 9, literally!! It drove so smoothly and so quiet.  Sometimes when I was stopped at a red light or stop sign, I would rev the engine just to make sure it was still running, cause it was so quiet.  Ours was a 5 speed, which I absolutely loved.  There was plenty of room in both the front and back seats.  My husband is 6 ft so leg room is a big factor for us.  Plenty of room to get the baby seat in and out as well.  And the trunk space.... well, I could easily get $300 worth of groceries in it (10 years ago, that was A LOT of groceries, especially since I was shopping at the commissary on base.)  We averaged about 35 mpg, which was very helpful since we did a lot of traveling to see family and for my husband to report for National Guard duty.  

We had the car about a year when I had a 3 car accident on the interstate. 
The vehicle in front of me (a toyota pickup) was damaged bad enough that he couldn't get his tailgate opened.  The vehicle behind me sustained a &quot;folded&quot; hood.  The ONLY damage to my car was the license plate on the front bumper got bent.  Seriously, that was it.  I was 3 months pregnant at the time and wearing my seatbelt.  I was not sore from the impact at all, even where the straps came across my chest and belly, (and the baby was fine too).  I truly believe that Mitsubishi makes a solid car.

We owned our Galant for 2 years and NEVER, not once, had to have any mechanical work done on it, other than the oil changes.  We traded in my Galant when our youngest daughter was born and we needed to have a car that would fit our family of 6.  That was a difficult decision to make, because there was absolutely NOTHING wrong with the Galant.  It had low miles, was running perfectly and was still just as beautiful as the day we bought it.  But we needed more room, so it was a must.  It helped, however, that we traded it in on a 1993 Mitsubishi Expo, of which I also HIGHLY recommend, but I couldn't find a category for it.

Hats off to whoever got my Galant, you got a GREAT used car!!<br><br>
