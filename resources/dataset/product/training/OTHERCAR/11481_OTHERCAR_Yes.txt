            My SL1 cost more than I should have paid. I paid a premium price for a car with a bad engine. It burned a quart every 500 miles. Bought it privately so there was no warranty only small claims court and that was iffy. This is a warning to others to change your oil every 3,000 miles.  I rebuilt the engine my self . The rings were gumed up at only 55,000 miles. I did find some design problems in the engine. The top piston ring is too narrow ( 1.2 mm ) wide. I drilled holes in the oil ring grooves in the pistons for better oil control. I used rod bearings from Clevet 77 , they have no notch to let out oil and I modified the rocker arms to spin the valves (they were burned). The car is a great grocery getter and is great on gas. I will install a rear stabalizer from a SL2 soon to improve handling.   thanks for letting me vent      Jim
