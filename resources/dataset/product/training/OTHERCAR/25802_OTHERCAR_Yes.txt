            My 1997 Mazda 626 LX Sedan was simply the best car I ever owned/leased. I only had it for 3 years; then was required to turn it in. I miss it terribly. It was the most comfortable, the most luxurious, the most trouble-free vehicle I've ever driven.

Due to circumstances within my control (bad credit), I was unable to lease another Mazda 626. I  should have purchased the vehicle. Although I'm happy with my Protege, I still long for the comfort, style, roominess, and class of the 626.  It had ease of handling. It was an attention getter. I received compliments galore on this vehicle. I just can't recommend it highly enough.<br><br>
