            The 1999 Dodge Intrepid is quite a car.  I purchased my 1999 Intrepid (base model) in August of 1998.  After 22000 miles, the only time in the shop has been for the Virginia State Inspection which it passed.

Compared to a 1994 ES Intrepid I previously owned, the 1999 wins hands down.  Dodge actually listened to owners and fixed the major Headlight problem.  The headlights on the '99 actually allow you to see and when the bright lights are turned on there is actually extra light.  Furthermore, my air conditioner made it past the one year mark and is still working.  I had the A/C fixed on the 1994 Intrepid 4 times each time lasting approximately 1 year.

The car handles the road great with the optional 16 inch Eagle tires.  Gas mileage has almost mirrored the sticker with 22 city and 29-30 on highway trips.  Road noise is a bit substantial, but with the radio on you won't hear a thing but the music.

If your looking for a car with room, this is the car.  The trunk is huge and 5 adults (or 4 adults and a car seat in my case) can easily fit in the passenger compartment.

A couple of negatives though.  The seats suck.  These have to be the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in.  On a long trip they are almost unbearable.  If Dodge had only add lumbar support and the option to lift/tilt the seat they could have prevented such a terrible problem.  Also, why they didn't include the 60/40 split back seat, for trunk pass through, in the base model is beyond me.  If this had been done this car could haul almost anything.<br><br>
