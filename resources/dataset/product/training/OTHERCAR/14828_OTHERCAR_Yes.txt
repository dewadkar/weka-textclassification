            I think this says a lot....I'm on my 2nd Mazda Protege.  This one is a 1998 and I haven't had a problem with it in the year and a half that I've had it.  It rides well, and has great pick up considering the fact that it's a compact car.  Although I almost always am driving, I'm told that the back seat is very comfortable and not crowded when I have 3 passengers.  The trunk is also quite roomy and functional.  I'm no expert on mechanics, but I do know that even when I've been neglectful of oil changes and checks, this car has continued to run well without problems.  I have had a couple of other people drive my car and they have also enjoyed the performance for short and long distances.  When I did have a door lock go out on me it was under warrantee and was repaired quickly by my dealer.

I suppose the only drawback is if you had a large family (more than 4) this car wouldn't be the one for you.  Otherwise you can't go wrong.<br><br>
