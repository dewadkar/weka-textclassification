            When my family got a used 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, I have to admit, I was very psyched to drive it. What I didn�t expect though, was a really comfortable ride. It handles like a SUV, but keeps you comfortable at the same time.

Like most SUV�s, the gas mileage on this automobile is pretty crappy. And with gas prices going up and up, that can be a major factor in deciding to buy a new car. 

The V8 engine is surprisingly powerful and delivers a lot of pickup. The first time flooring the accelerator will make you think twice about calling SUV�s slow behemoths. The sound system is very clean and clear and the optional CD player has never given us any trouble.

The car has an information panel that reminds you when to get a tune-up, which is very handy. But other than regular oil changes, this car has needed little maintenance.

For someone who doesn�t want to sacrifice a fun, fast ride for cargo space, I would highly recommend this automobile.
