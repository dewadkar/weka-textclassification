            When I was in the market for my first car I really wanted a Ford Mustang, unfortunately my wallet wouldn't allow that.  I then stumbled upon a <b>1985 Mercury Capri</b>.  It looked almost exactly like a Ford Mustang.  The only noticeable difference was that the rear hatchback window was kind of like a "bubble" instead of more flat.  That really didn't matter to me, I test drove the car and I was in LOVE!

<b>Features</b>

I bought a light blue <b>Mercury Capri</b> with the following features.  

�Cruise Control:  The cruise control buttons are conveniently located on the steering wheel which was very nice for all the long freeway trips I took in this car.
�Power Windows
�Automatic Transmission
�AM/FM Cassette Player with Rear speakers
�Cloth Interior (it was blue)

<b>How did it perform?</b>
I was a bit apprehensive about how this car was going to perform.  I was young and truthfully I wanted it because I liked the way it looked. I had not done any research on how reliable these cars were but I figured that since Mercury is a division of Ford, I was safe.  My parents had other ideas.  My mother says FORD stands for "Found on Round Dead" or "Fix or Repair Daily".  I always told her it really stood for "First on Race Day!".

I owned this car for about 4 years and never had any major problems with it. I did have a few minor things that required repair.  I repaired the brake light switch and a few other minor things. The only other problem that I can remember having was that the hatchback never stayed up.  You would open up the rear hatch and it would close back down so you always had to hold this heavy hatch up or prop it with a piece of wood (not very safe) while you unloaded the car.  That was a pain and I am sure that we should have had it fixed, but we were poor college students.

I drove this car many miles, to and from college.  When I reached about the 80,000 mile mark I decided it was time for a new car. My husband and I were thinking of starting a family and we wanted a four door car that we new would last us for several more years.  We were concerned that this car, although it was performing well, was getting up there in miles.  Also, we were living in Chico where it gets quite warm in the summer and the car did <b>NOT</b> have air conditioning and we really wanted something with air conditioning.

I was very happy with my Mercury Capri.  The car had a V-6 engine ( I know NOTHING about cars, so that is about the only mechanical details you are going to get from me) and it had a lot of oomph.  My friend used to say that the car really "scoots".

I am happy that I chose the Mercury Capri, it was a much cheaper version of a Ford Mustang.  They had similar features and a similar body style.  The car performed well and was 7 years old when we sold it.  We had very minor problems in the time that we owned it.  

If you were to find one of these cars now, it would be about 16 years old.  Most people are not in the market for cars of that age, however there are other Mercury brand cars out there.  I think that Mercury is a good brand and is definitely worth a look.  Don't let the fact that it isn't one of the major manufacturers scare you away. For the money, this is a stylish, reliable car.
