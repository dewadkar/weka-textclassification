            I purchased this vehicle brand new in 1996, as a lease. It was a 4 door.  We had traded in a 92' Ford Explorer.  Much to our surprise, it is much smaller inside. The body style is much more sporty looking.  

I loved the look of the Blazer.  I think it's one of the best looking SUV's out there.  The seats were comfortable in the front, but the seats in the back were very small. Access to controls were pretty good as well. The heating and air conditioning worked great. 
Maybe we just purchases a lemon, but we had major electrical problems right after our warranty expired.  The power seats no longer moved, our power door locks no longer worked, only manually.  The worst were the wind shield wipers that only worked when they wanted to.  I felt I was in danger when it rained IF they worked since they would suddenly stop. It just got to the point that I did not leave my home if it was going to rain for the safety of my children and I.  We had leather seats, and the threading came apart even though we had a seat cover on the drivers seat. We constantly had the &quot;check engine&quot; light burning with no reason what so ever.  When that the light would appear, for the next 20 miles, the vehicle would jerk going from first to second gear, then resume normally.  

We ended up turning this in early on a lease and pay out the nose just to get rid of it.  We ended up purchasing a Astro.  On the way to turn in the Blazer and pick up the Astro, my daughter and I were in the Blazer waiting on my husband.  I kept smelling something burning and turned to look and the fuse box was smoking!  Another short but this time it was bad.  20 minutes later, we drove the Blazer to the dealership and parked it praying it would catch on fire so no one would have to live with this lemon of a vehicle!

Who should buy this vehicle? Nobody with more that one or two kids.  It is definitely not roomy in the back seat. And no one should buy mine since it was such a lemon.  <br><br>
