            I bought a V-6 Firebird Coupe last March, and it has proven to me to be one of the fastest 6 cylinders that I have ever been in.  It has a 3800 series II, 3.8 liter, v-6.  I bought it because I wanted a fast car that had lower insurance than the V-8.  My car has a K&amp;N High Performance Air Filter and it gave me an extra 5 horsepower.  Now I'm working with about 210 horsepower which I love because it is real quick.  The only bad thing about the v-6 is that it is slower going into second gear.  That is really the only complaint I have about it.  If you're debating between a Firebird, Mustang, or a Camaro, definitely go for the Firebird. I've walked the dog on the other two.  

This car rides much better than most people imagine.  You would expect a real bumpy ride but in all reality it's pretty smooth.  Now don't get me wrong though it is a sports car.

If you like a fast car but not as strong as the v-8, go for the v-6 Firebird, but if you're looking for high insurance, and unretainable power go with the Trans Am.   <br><br>
