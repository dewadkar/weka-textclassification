            I've had a Honda Accord for many years, and recently decided I was tired of owning the same car as everyone on my street. 

I chose the Audi A4 1.8 liter turbo-charged version.  I really wanted the look of a German sedan, which sets itself apart from the Honda sedans, and other Honda knock offs.  The 1.8L provides 150 horsepower which is plenty for the commute I plan to use it for.  I also elected for the five-speed Tiptronic automanual transmission. I chose the &quot;Advance&quot; interior package and am very happy with the look and feel this creates.  For the money, you won't find a vehicle this &quot;sexy&quot;, that as standard provides: automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, heated outside mirrors and windshield-wiper nozzles, eight-speaker CD audio system, and 60/40 split folding rear seats, dual front airbags, side-impact airbags mounted in the front seats and antilock brakes.  And on top of all of this, all A4s include free scheduled maintenance for three years, as well as a three-year/50,000 mile warranty. 

I found the A4 to be the best entry-level luxury sedan on the market.  I have and will continue to recommend this vehicle to friends who are interested in moving into a more exciting, luxurious sedan.<br><br>
