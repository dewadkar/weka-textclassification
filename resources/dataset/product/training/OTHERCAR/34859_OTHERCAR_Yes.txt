            My wife and I are expecting our first child and we have started to make the necessary changes to our lifestyle:
No more fun (just kidding).
Sold the 2 seater convertible (see my other reviews)
Sold the CR-V (too small)
Got a 4-door sedan (see other review)
Got a minivan (this is the review)

Now that we are properly equipped for this adventure let me tell you about our minivan. We purchased a 2001 Honda Odyssey EX NAV. We pretty much optioned it out (trailer hitch, mudguards, roof rack, leather steering wheel cover, etc.) and we love it. It is by far the fastest and best handling minivan of all the ones we tested (no I am not counting the whole SUV world). This thing has LOTS of room! With the middle seats removed and the back seats folded down you can lay a 4�x 8� sheet of plywood on the floor.
The neatest thing for me is the navigation system. It uses GPS signals to find your locations and a DVD drive to store maps of the entire United States! It does a very decent job of locating you and getting you where you want to go. This is the same system that is in the upscale Acura line.
The van drives about as well as I think a minivan can. Moving from a 2-seater convertible is quite an adjustment, but some of the minivans we drove really tended to �float� along the road and felt cheap. The Odyssey cruises great (70+ no problem) and the punch around town is fun. We have been averaging about 20 miles per gallon so far. My wife really likes the ride.

On the down side, the vans are almost all sold before they get to the lot. We had to order ours and wait 3 months for it to arrive. I think the LX models are a bit more plentiful. This means that there is basically no negotiation on the price. We paid MSRP (ouch). This is the joy of supply and demand. Some dealers are marking up the vans, but ours (Performance Honda, Cincinnati OH) at least didn�t do that. I am concerned about the power doors. There were lots of problems on the 1999 model but they claim to have redesigned them for 2001. I will say that the sliding action sounds better that the earlier model we tested. Because of this concern we opted for an extended warranty (5 years, 100000 miles). I don�t usually do this, but my wife drives a lot and we are already at 750 miles in two weeks. She would burn through the 36000-mile warranty in about 1 � years. With the baby on the way I didn�t want to have to worry about putting miles on the van and the doors breaking down in 2 years.

Overall we are very satisfied with the Odyssey. Almost all the other people that we have spoken with (kid enabled) either love their Odyssey or wish they could have bought one. I will update this review as we put some more miles on the great white box.
