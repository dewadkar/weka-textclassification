            I owned a 1989 CRX Si for six years, and sold it with 110K miles for $2,700. As the body started to decay from the Chicago winters, I decided it was time for a replacement.  I wanted my next "daily driver" to deliver many of the same things that made me love the CRX Si so much.

Here were my criteria.
* Affordable
* Sporty looking
* Good economy (30+ mpg)
* Peppy performance
* Low maintenance requirements
* Handles well
* Safety and Security

The del Sol delivers on all items, some remarkably so, and others less. I've owned the del Sol for 3 months. Here's how it's met my requirements so far.

Affordable - I paid $7,500 + tax & title for a '95 with 66K miles. The dealer originally asked $12,995 (a laugher), and I negotiated all the way down to the eventual sale price. While they offered me very little for my CRX on trade, I sold it in 2 days for the $2,700 asking price - CRX's are kind of a cult favorite, and they haven't been made since 1991. My net was $4,800 ($7,500 - $2,700) plus the tax and title I had to pay on the del Sol. It certainly helped buying this car before the nice Spring weather hit.

Sporty looking - You can't beat anything close to the price of a del Sol when it comes to appearance in a sporty small car. Miatas are thousands more, and it gets worse from there. The del Sol has a removeable hard top, which my wife can easily lift off and put in the slot in the trunk. The rear window powers down, leaving only A-pillars to the rear of the seats. It's very open and convertible-like feeling, but also has the advantages of the stability and security of a hardtop when the weather is not so nice.

Good Economy - I average about 31mpg combined. While I haven't calculated the highway mileage because I need a trip of 300+ miles, I estimate city to be 26 - 27 mpg, and highway to be about 34 - 35 mpg at 70mph average speed.

Peppy performance - While not a torquey as the CRX, probably due to the weight difference and gearing, the del Sol Si is a fun driver. It loves to sing at the higher rpm rangers on the tachometer, making it an excellent car to zip through moderate highway traffic at speed.

Low maintenance - It's a Honda. Change the oil every 3,000 miles, and you're home free. Brakes and tires last a long time on this light car. Mine came with a new set of Cooper tires, and the 4-wheel disc brakes are in great shape. Both will probably last another 40K. I may replace the timing belt at 80K, and I expect the starter and alternator to go perhaps in the 100K area.

Handling - It zips around nicely, although it is not as nimble as the CRX Si. Compared to most other small cars, this one holds its own in handling. The suspension feels softer than the CRX Si, and more sway and lean are felt in cornering. Most of my driving is straight-line, so the effect is minimized.

Safety - dual airbags, no ABS. It's a small car, with the safety issues they all face when confronting larger vehicles.

Security - the removable hardtop makes this a much more secure vehicle than a ragtop. A knife cuts through a ragtop much easier than busting into a hardtop, as the del Sol is when the top is locked in place.
