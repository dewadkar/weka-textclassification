            mazda has taken the Miata to a new plane.  At first I thought it was just a re introdued model but after taking this cat fro a spin I found myself looking for the lease papers!  It was fantastic.  I dont think that I have ever seen a bad review on the Miata by any major magazine.  Car and Driver loved it!  Its a strange feling its like driving a go-cart.  its extremely responsive.  With different tires this car handles as good or better than most luxury sports cars.  Its a dream to drive.  The high output engine even sounds nice, and with added insulation it isnt as loud on the long trips.  <br><br>
