            What attracted me most to this camera is definitely the price.  Usually a 1.3 megapixel camera with 1280x960 resolution is around $399 or more.  The price for the MX-1200 is considerably less, and I actually bought it on sale at K-mart for $249 with a $50 mail-in rebate from Fuji.  You just can't beat that.  Others say they also got a free smartmedia memory card, but I'm happy with the deal I got.  It's very easy to choose between resolutions and other settings.  You can set the date and have it &quot;stamped&quot; onto each pic if you wish.  Also, there is a 2x zoom, which I find very useful, and is only found on more expensive cameras.  My only complaints about it are that it uses the slower serial port connection to upload pics to the pc, there's no carrying case, and no video output to show pictures on a television.  The software, while good, seems kind of standard, nothing great.  Like I said, for the price, those are some things I could overlook.  I haven't used it much, but I was extremely happy with just the 640x480 resolution when I first tried it.  The flash works great, and everything comes out very clear with lots of detail.  I haven't tried any of the manual options, since I'm basically a beginner, so I leave it on auto mode.  Therefore, I would highly recommend this camera to beginners who want to take great-looking pics with ease.  My other recommendations are to definitely get Ni-MH rechargable batteries and a charger, because regular alkalines die out pretty quickly if you always use the LCD viewfinder like I do.  I recently bought an Energizer 5 hour charger on sale for $12.99 at Target and 4 Rayovac Ni-MH batteries for $12.  In conclusion, this camera is the best deal I have seen, and I highly recommend it to first-time buyers or people who want to upgrade from their old 480x360 digital camera like I did.  <br><br>
