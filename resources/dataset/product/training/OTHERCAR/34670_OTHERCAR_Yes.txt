            I have always wanted to buy a fast car for the longest time but money or circumstance would deter me.  I have been talking about getting the WS6 Trans AM for about three years now and now finally did just that.  I have been driving the Trans AM now for about 4 months.

The factory specs list this model as having 325 horsepower, which sounded pretty impressive to me.  The model I have has the optional Hurst 6speed shifter.  If you want to smoke the tires have no fear.  If you drive light and casual it will never get away from you.  If you jam the gas petal to the floor it will definitely respond to the point of making you very nervous.

Someone had mentioned to me that the 2002 model was under spec'd on its horsepower.  Curious about the claim he made I had the car officially dyno'd at a pro shop.  After three runs the car's best spec was 374 horsepower. I was pretty much in shock when I saw the results as well as the tech that was running the computer.

The sound of the exhaust system is quite nice.  If you are casually driving it will stay pretty quit.  Once you get to medium to high acceleration it will get loud in a sweet deep rumbling style.  I like when I rev the car when stopped and see the whole car slightly twist to the power.

The exterior styling is pretty incredible. The material they used seems very strong and durable.  The curves of the body feel sexy and futuristic yet powerful.  The WS6 Ram Air hood really does it for me though.  I see many heads turn to look at the car when I drive by.

I have gone as fast as 130 MPH and it still has quit a bit to go.  When I hit 130 MPH I was only around 4500 RPMs in 5th gear.  I can take it up to 110 MPH in forth gear with plenty of room before hitting yellow line on the tach.  My guess is it will do around 175 MPH.  I love when accelerate quickly how it presses me back into the seat.

If I've woke up on the wrong side of the bed or have had a long day at work there is nothing like sliding behind the wheel of this car and feel total mental bliss wash over me once again.
