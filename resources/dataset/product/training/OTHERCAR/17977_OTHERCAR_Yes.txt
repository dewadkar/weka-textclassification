            I bought my Jeep Wrangler in 1998 for the function of my business.  I am a crop consultant for cranberry growers in Wisconsin and I drive in DEEP mud, powdery sand and drifted snow to do my job.  I have had 4X4 pickup trucks before and never failed to get them mired in the remote, isolated terrain where I do my work.  My 1998 Jeep Wrangler is a 4.0 liter, Sport Edition and has performed amazingly well.  I have admired the abilities of my Jeep and breathed sighs of relief innumerable times in the two years I have owned it.  I love the ability to get into tight situations and 'dig' myself out of them with this little guy!  It is obvious why the U.S. military kept them as the standard vehicle for battlefield conveyance for so many decades and really what is a Hummer but a big, high tech JEEP?

I love the way it handles on the highway, I love the way it handles in the backwoods of Wisconsin (and many other places as well) and I love the way it plows through snow drifts that would grab onto longer, heavier 4X4's.  The only thing I don't like about my Jeep is that while driving on glare ice it is difficult to bring it out of a spin; the short wheelbase that HELPS it in digging out of deep mud, sand or snow is the SAME thing that gets it into trouble when driving on ice.  Considering the low frequency where I am actually REQUIRED to drive on ice, I don't mind it.

The people who should drive this vehicle are those that want to get somewhere when the weather conditions are extreme, where the roads to travel are impassable to other types of 4X4's or someone who wants a comfortable, safe vehicle to drive whether it's on Interstate Highways, swamps, sand dunes, or snow drifts. <br><br>
