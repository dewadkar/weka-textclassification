Without going into a lot of background information, let&#146s just cut right to the chase: I bought a 1993 Isuzu Rodeo a couple of months ago and have been enjoying it ever since.

This vehicle is a sport utility vehicle designed to conserve fuel and give a comfortable ride &#150 not win rally-car races or outrun Granny&#146s Cadillac.  It reaches highway speed without any problems and provides a smooth enough ride, which is all I really care about. 

The 1993 Rodeo is a mid-sized boxy affair with plenty of room for passengers and cargo alike.  (Just look at the product photo &#150 you&#146ll see what I&#146m talking about there.)
There are four windows that can be rolled down manually.  There are also two permanent windows in the back (cargo area) that provide plenty of visibility when backing up or checking out what&#146s behind you.  The rear cargo area also features a rising glass pane that can be locked for security reasons &#150 or to keep those dastardly hostages from escaping.

Mine is a sort of apple red, but there are other more subdued colors (such as black or a dark green that&#146s almost aqua in nature).  The paint job needs a little touch-up work, but is intact for the most part.  The interior features tan colors and dark cloth seats.  These seats absorb quite a bit of crap (such as grease, as I found the day I looked at the vehicle for the first time), but can easily be Scotch-guarded to prevent permanent staining.  They can also be cleaned with soap and water or a mixture of orange oil, soap and water (which works very well on those infernal grease stains I was just telling you all about).


The engine needs a little work, which I just discovered yesterday when a funny grinding noise developed.  It&#146s not serious, however.  I&#146m not complaining &#150 the engine has over 200,000 miles on it, so it&#146s well deserving of a little repair work if you ask me.

Speaking of the engine&#133I really like it.  It&#146s a small four-cylinder 2.6-liter designed by Isuzu to conserve fuel and provide a bit of performance at the same time.  Maintaining it is actually quite easy, though I recommend using a funnel to add fresh engine oil (the opening isn&#146t even two inches in diameter &#150 very easy to miss).  

Tuning it up is a breeze, as most of the components are within easy reach for those of us who don&#146t have enormous hands.  If you&#146re a girl, this is going to be easy.  If you&#146re a guy with a hand large enough to grip a basketball, get your girlfriend to help you.

Other than that problem, my Rodeo is in great shape considering that it was manufactured a decade ago.

The five-speed manual transmission shifts smoothly (without the help of a tachometer, which would make me very happy).  First gear is very, very low, so I&#146m almost tempted to ignore it and start in second &#150 a bad idea but one that would probably be more convenient for me.  


Isuzu makes four-wheel-drive Rodeos, but mine is the two-wheel-drive option.  I don&#146t mind this because I find that my Rodeo gets in and out of muddy fields (i.e. the one that leads to my house &#150 and the only way to GET to my house!) without problems provided that I keep decent all-terrain tires on the back.  

The four-wheel-drive Rodeos are a little more expensive, and are harder to find in my area unless you&#146re willing to settle for one that&#146s been run to hell and back.  If that&#146s the case, you&#146re obviously looking at more repair work and maintenance than I am.  

Either way, the Rodeo sits on a four-wheel-drive chassis, which makes handling a little rough.  A good suspension system helps this, but please remember that you aren&#146t driving a luxury sedan: it&#146s going to be a little rough even on the highway.

The anti-sway bar on the front helps maintain a balanced center of gravity, which of course helps prevent rollover incidents.  Even so, this SUV wasn&#146t designed to take sharp turns at 60 MPH.


Now, on to the interior of the Rodeo:

  Instruments, gauges, dials and other controls are set up in a logical manner and are very easy to reach.  Push-buttons on either side of the instrument panel operate headlights and windshield wipers.  This took a little bit of time to get used to, but once I got the hang of it I fell in love with the concept.  I&#146m a sucker for convenience &#150 what can I say?

The only problem is that the Rodeo isn&#146t equipped with a tachometer or one of those sissified lights that read &#147SHIFT&#148 when it&#146s time to change gears.  I don&#146t like the shift light (makes me think the manufacturer believes its buyers to be complete idiots), but it would be nicer than relying completely on sound and speedometer readings.  

A well-padded bench seat takes up the front of the Rodeo.  It&#146s comfortable and easy to move forward or backward with a lever underneath the driver&#146s side.  The headrest (a padded, plastic-covered thing) doesn&#146t do much for me: to use it, I&#146d have to lean wayyyy back, which would just be weird (it would also make it very hard for me to see).


Long drives are nothing in this vehicle.  Whether you&#146re running to the grocery store up the street or driving an hour at a time, you&#146ll find that the seats are comfortable, the safety restraints don&#146t choke you or rub your neck raw, and &#150 of course &#150 that your butt has refrained from going numb.
  
  The pedals are roughly the size of saltine crackers, but I like them because they&#146re spaced out adequately.  My big, clumsy foot doesn&#146t confuse the brake with the clutch &#150 and of course, said foot doesn&#146t find itself half on the accelerator and half on the brake.  If you&#146ve ever had that happen, you&#146ll know what I mean when I say it&#146s the most annoying thing in the world save for that strange itching sensation in your buttocks (while you&#146re in public and cannot remedy it without committing a social sin).

I had to purchase an aftermarket stereo system to replace the factory version (it was removed by the auction lot that sold the vehicle to the dealership that sold it to me &#150 I hope you&#146re as confused as I am now).  However, I&#146ve invested just a couple of hundred dollars into the entertainment system and it&#146s paying off nicely.  There are four speakers &#150 two in the rear cargo area and two at the very front &#150 that provide excellent sound coverage depending on the quality of the installed system and speakers.

  Storage space is more than adequate.  The rear cargo hold (part rising glass window, part dropping tailgate) is actually easy to open, which was a nice surprise.  I expected it to be a pain in the butt considering that the spare tire is mounted on a rack that swings outward from the rear gate.

 Lowering the tailgate allows for easy loading and unloading of groceries and all that other good stuff college students such as myself like to lug around (like $300 worth of textbooks, which will only be used for a few months and then sold back to the college for the whopping sum of $50 &#150 those con artists).
  Because the cargo area is carpeted, I would highly recommend either Scotch-guarding it or laying something down (i.e. a tarp) before loading anything that will stain it (like a greasy auto part, for example, which I&#146ve had to haul before).

  The rear bench seat can hold three people, but I don&#146t recommend putting a full-sized adult in the middle.  The window seats feature shoulder restraints for added safety, and there are also &#147oh sh** handles&#148 in case the driver (yours truly) decides to get a bit liberal on turns.

  
  Overall, the Rodeo is easy to drive and is perfect for driving four or five people around.  Well, you could put two up front with the driver (with a lap belt for the middle passenger), but that person would get in the way of the gearshift, so don&#146t bother.
  It&#146s a fun, easy-to-drive vehicle that offers everything I need: reliability, cargo room, a little ground clearance to get through my &#147road,&#148 and a price tag that doesn&#146t make me cringe.
 
  Retail value according to the Kelley Blue Book (the standard for automotive pricing in America) is set at a little over three thousand dollars, which is about what I&#146m paying for it after all is said and done.  Insurance costs me forty dollars a month because it&#146s listed on my mother and father&#146s policy (perfectly legal but a lot cheaper than other alternatives).  

Five stars because the problems I mentioned are either A: part of what you get when you buy a decade-old vehicle or B: easily fixed with inexpensive aftermarket accessories.  There is nothing inherently wrong with the Rodeo &#150 and I&#146m madly in love with it - so there.
