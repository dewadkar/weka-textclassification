            My father recently purchased a Dodge Dakota Sport regular cab with the 318 cid motor.  He opted for the new-for-this-year paint job of Solar Yellow.  It's affectionately known as &quot;The Bee&quot;, and let me tell you, it packs quite a sting!

I've always thought the Dakota was a great truck, having multiple choices for motor, cab, bed length, trim, but above all it's just the right size.  If Goldilocks was in the pickup market, this is the truck she'd buy.  Smaller options like the Ford Ranger and Chevy S-10 are just plain toys.  They are like sitting in an Escort with a big trunk and an extra differential.  On the other side, full size trucks are just too darn big.  If you aren't a steel worker, or have the need to move livestock around on a regular basis, you don't need a full size truck.  Chances are you'll have to butter it up to get it in your garage also.  

The Bee has been tricked out with factory Solar Yellow running boards, a hydraulic, fiberglass lift-up tonneau cover from ARE, also yellow, and a neat 3-piece black wind/bug deflector.  On the underside the shocks have been replaced with new Edlebrock IAS Performers at all four wheels, which ride SUPER smooth.  A K&amp;N filtercharger kit, along with a new intake manifold let it breathe more freely, a bored-out throttle body is in the works.  

This is a great looking, great performing, great riding truck that turns heads wherever it goes.  All for around $25K.  As my father would say, &quot;that truck is slicker than hen sh*t on a pump handle.&quot;  <br><br>
