            This is my second digital camera. The most important feature for me is the size. I have captured great shots because I had my camera in my pocket instead of at home.

I won't spend a lot of time on features because you can read other reviews. I will address some of the cons that most people complain about. First, for those people who complain about weak flash they have never owned a Nikon 775. That camera had a range of 4ft and exhibited lots of noise (red) when the image started getting under exposed. The S400 has a great range for a compact camera. It can easily flood a normal size room and capture that group shot. If you want to take a flash picture of the Washington memorial this is the wrong camera.

Second, the battery life is quite adequate. I have taken well over 100 shots with flash. I do recommend buying an extra battery for about $40 but it is so small that it is not a problem to carry when you know you are going to do a lot of shooting. 

Third, it has lots of manual features. You can do focus lock (just as good as manual focus in my opinion). Some people complain about the auto focus. I think it is great that it draws little boxes around on what you are focusing. My Nikon would always focus on the background even in portrait mode. I have never been disappointed with the focus of the Canon. You can do exposure lock (just as good as manual exposure). You can do manual white balance.

It also has a great long exposure mode with noise reduction. I have tested it with some star shots and it can resolve Barnard's star as a binary and the noise reduction is great.

After owning the Nikon the Canon is a joy. The strong case is heavier but more rugged. My Nikon died when it was dropped and it will cost more to fix than it is worth.
