                 My 1994 is not my first, I have had a 1986 (which is a very good year, if you want a older Suburban) and 1992.  I am looking to buy a 2001, and I can't wait.  We have a large family and need room for the kids, their friends, the dog, baseball equipment, ect. and of course the always beloved ROAD TRIP. There is so much room for extra  stuff in the back we never have to worry about how much stuff we bring... well, One time we did, our month long trip from Wisconsin to California, we ended up coming home with a trailer attached.  But for the most part we all stay pretty comfortable, longer legged people need to be in the middle or front seat, and while it can be a bummer to always have to bring up the seat to get in the very back, it's worth the hassle for us.  
     A large vehicle like this can be intimidating, but the car like feel while driving allows you to feel at ease while maneuvering the hi-ways and bi-ways. You do have to get used to driving the Suburban, especially on the snow and ice.  I have found the ABS breaks on my 1992 and 1994 not to work as well as they should.  I was told by one dealer ship to disconnect my ABS during the winter, (I did not do it) because they found that my ABS breaks worked 80% of the time.  The long wheel base of the vehicle can make for a scary ride, since the rear end can come around quick on the ice.  It's nice looking for being so large, and for the most part make me feel safe while driving.<br><br>
