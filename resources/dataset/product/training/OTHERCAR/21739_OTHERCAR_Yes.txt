            The best car I ever owned was a Lexus SC400 (1995), but I was paying about $1,200 a month.  (OK, you're right!  Who the @#*!!* negotiated that deal?)  I'm just telling you my history to establish credibility.

Now I have a 1998 Chevy Cavalier.  I paid $10,000 for it, used.  It had about 30,000 miles on it.  Now, a Lexus SC400, it ain't...but what do you expect when you aren't paying mortgage prices?  That's the one criterion people use that always makes me laugh to myself.  &quot;The ride's not as smooth as some family sedans...&quot;  I say, remember the scale, consult the key.

What the Chevy Cavalier is is reliable, reasonably peppy (although I don't jump onto the Merritt Parkway in front of some Beemer barreling down on me at 75mph), a quiet ride, and great gas mileage--about 26 mpg on the daily one hour commute.  It's also cute and pretty sporty.  (I wouldn't call it sexy, but for the $1,000 plus I am saving every month I can buy lots of slinky dresses.  That conjures up some image, doesnt it?)
