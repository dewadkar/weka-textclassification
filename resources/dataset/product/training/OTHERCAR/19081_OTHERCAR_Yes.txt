            My mother bought a brand new Sonata back in 1989 down in Miami, Florida.  I was 22 and I loved borrowing that car to ride along the strip at Miami Beach with four of my friends in the back seat and one up front.  There was plenty of room for us inside the vehicle and the trunk was more than spacious enough for all our beach gear - including an oversized cooler!  

It wasn't until after we moved to New York that I realized just how roomy, comfortable and durable the Sonata was.  There were three of us in the car - well five if you count the two cats.  That Sonata purred the whole way from Miami to NYC..we only stopped for bathroom breaks and food and that car still kept going.  We used it to make the round trip to Florida to visit friends and relatives on several occasions and still that car purred on!  When my mother finally drove the Sonata to the junk yard in '98 (she had her eye on a sporty new vehicle) it was a sad day.

Because the Sonata was so comfortable to ride in and was able to withstand high mileage, I bought a used '95 Sonata in '96.  It already had 30,000 highway miles on it yet it still purred like a kitty.  Today, after all my road trips I've put an additional 46,000 miles on the car and only had to replace the breaks - aside from the regular fluid changes and tune-ups I have yet to sink another dime into my car for wear and tear.

I am very hard on my Sonata, I tend to gun the engine, floor it up a hill, not warm it up in the winter and yet she still purrs just like when I bought her four years ago.

The four doors on the Sonata also allows you to transport bulk items with ease..I brought home a 36&quot; TV, a PC and monitor - both in the original bulky boxes from the store without a hitch.  I even brought home a 7' Christmas tree inside the vehicle - not on the roof (God Forbid I Scratch It)!  The trunk is spacious enough that five women went on a four day vacation and all of our luggage fit inside!!

This is a great car for people on the go who tend to take a lot of luggage with them.
