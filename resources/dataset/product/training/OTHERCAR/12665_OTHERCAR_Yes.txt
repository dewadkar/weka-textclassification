            For the past few months I have owned a 1997 Chevrolet Cavalier 4 door base model, given to me by my sister.  She had bought the car new and over the past 3 years she had only managed to put on 20,000 miles.  As you can imagine I jumped at the opportunity of taking the car off her hands, since I knew that she had taken really good care of it, and had never had any problems with the car since owning it.

Since receiving this car I have had a new respect for Chevrolet.  I have always owned Japanese cars, and I have found that the Chevrolet Cavalier is a good buy for your money (12 000$).   The car is equipped with an automatic transmission, dual airbags, AC, and the all-important ABS breaks.  I would also add that it is a very good-looking car, considering it is a four door.   

I find that the Cavalier is �a tightly built car�.  What I mean by this is that the car is very quiet; when you hit a bump everything does not rattle.  Steering is very direct; there is no feel of vagueness.  The car is very peppy, acceleration is very respectable, and in no time you are at the speed limit.  Visibility is also very good, although backing up can be tricky.  

The car is quite spacious; the back seat easily accommodates 1 baby seat and 2 adults.  The truck is enormous, compared to other compacts.  The instrument panel is well laid out, and there are enough compartments to put your everyday items. 

I have recently changed the front breaks. I encountered no problems doing this. They were easily accessible and extremely easy to change.  I must mention that I found it a little disconcerting that I had to also change the front discs. They were completely used, right to the metal, and only 26, 000 miles on the odometer.  I am going to give it the benefit of the doubt, and attribute the premature deterioration of the discs to a defective batch or to a possible problem with the ABS.   I hope that the next time the breaks need to be done, the discs will still be in good condition.  

If you are considering buying a car, I strongly recommend looking at this car. It really is a good buy for you money.
