            The bus driver just dumped us there in the middle of the Dollar Rent-a-Car lot. The sun was brutal, I tell you: 106 degrees, and it was barely past noon. There they sat, two rows of Intrepids -- all we had to do was choose.

Now I'd driven another 2001 Intrepid (from Enterprise) just a few weeks earlier, and I hadn't been particularly impressed. It wasn't memorable enough to write a review, if you know what I mean. But there I stood with my stack of luggage, my starving spouse, and my hotel reservation 300 miles away. So I took the blue one. Blue, navy blue, I figured I'd be blue as blue could be. "But at least it isn't a Neon," I thought.

Four days and 1100 miles later, I brought the Blue Intrepid back -- dusty and dirty, but with a full belly and a light heart. And I have to say, I was much more impressed this time around.

<b>The Beige Intrepid</b> was delivered to me with about 24,000 miles on the clock (getting close to time to sell, I think). It looked as though quite a few of those miles had been pretty brutal. There were rusty nails in the trunk, nail-polish stains on the carpet, and a couple of cigarette burns in the upholstery. The worst thing about the car, though, was the mechanics -- heck, it's not the fault of Daimler-Chrysler that somebody abused the poor thing's carpet! But the ride was sloppy, the interior noise level at about that of your average rock concert, and the thing would habitually wait for about half a second before responding to the accelerator. I got lousy mileage, too - about 17 MPG, which I don't consider very good for a V6 powerplant. I didn't do a review -- but if I had, I might have been generous and given it two stars...

But <b>the Blue Intrepid</b> changed my mind! Dollar gave me a car with about 4500 miles on the odometer, and it hadn't been beaten to death -- at least not before <i>I</i> got my hands on it! This baby hauled the two of us from Vegas to Tahoe and back (1100 miles in all) without a hitch, and did it all at a sparkling 29 MPG! What a turnaround! So, I officially apologize to Dodge for thinking the car is a piece of brown and stinky stuff, and give it four stars -- although it's really about a three-and-a-half.

<b>As Equipped:</b>

Our Intrepid in Nevada had the standard 2.7 litre V6 engine, which yields 200 horsepower; the vehicle is front-wheel drive for those of you in snowy climes. Additional (optional) engine configurations are a 3.2L 222 hp V6 and a 3.5L 242 hp V6. Both Intrepids I drove had the four-speed automatic overdrive transmission (with that stupid-looking L-3-D on the shifter); to my knowledge no other transmission is available. Both versions of the car had a standard tachometer; the Intrepid's instrument panel features white-faced gages and those ugly Dodge spermatazoan needles. Both had on-steering-wheel controls for the cruise control.

Neither of the two Intrepids had serious manufacturing defects. The finishing of the carpet in the Beige one was ragged, but that might have been due to wear. There were no noticeable problems in paint or other finish, and all joints appeared smooth and even. Hood access is good, though a high lip on the trunk opening would probably make loading difficult for shorter people. 


<b>The Accelerator Pedal - Positive Points</b>

+ The cabin is spacious, rated for five passengers. We had seven in it on a three-mile trip, and only the six-three guy riding the console was unhappy. The two adults and two adolescent boys in the back were cramped but didn't feel completely like sardines.
+ The trunk is likewise roomy, with room for three large suitcases plus the few little things <i>I</i> brought along, like a backpack and a toothbrush. The 60/40 fold-down rear seat allows transportation of larger items, as long as they're skinny enough to fit in the trunk (note, as above, the high lip on the trunk).
+ There's a glove compartment large enough to hold more than the owner's manual (wow!), and a console compartment that'll hold tapes, CDs, and so forth. A power port for your phone is stashed in the console compartment.
+ The Intrepid comes equipped with a dual front cupholder, two power ports, rearseat cupholder (behind the console), and "mommy locks" that automatically lock when speed exceeds about 5 MPH.
+ The standard A/C handled that broiling Nevada sun without any problems. I have <i>no</i> idea how well the heater and defroster work, though!
+ The engine sipped daintily at its gasoline tank to the tune of 29 MPG, even though both drivers tend to the lead-foot end of the spectrum. It uses regular fuel, too. The power plant climbed hills smoothly (there were a few low passes along the way) and offered sufficient reserve power for passing on two-lane highways or those nasty short entrance ramps on freeways. 


<b>Neutral Gear - It Could Go Either Way</b>

+ Some people think this car is a sleek, sexy-looking machine. I'm not one of them -- the cab-forward design and the flat rear end combine to make it look somehow roach-like, at least to me. I think a two-door might be more attractive than the four-door, based on the similar Dodge Stratus.
+ There is an <i>optional</i> full-sized spare tire. Curses upon whoever invented those things!
* The AM/FM/Cassette delivered average sound, though it's hard to tell in Nevada where radio stations are a bit on the scarce side! I'd spring for a CD player if I were buying this for myself.
= The driving seats are of average comfort; supportive but not overly so. Lumbar support is fair, but there is little or no adjustability (at least in the standard seats).


<b>The Brakes - Downers</b>

- The transmission is, to be blunt, not very smart. It will drop you from the top gear (overdrive) to the lowest range if you punch a little too hard, even at highway speeds. In both cars, it almost redlined the engine when passing a truck on the highway. In my book, this is the most serious defect the vehicle has.
- The cabin does not suffer from wind noise, but some road surfaces certainly make themselves known. A case in point is those narrow strips of smooth "tar" in macadam roads: the car's response to crossing each of them was an almost musical "thrum"! That's all right, I guess, until you hit about your fortieth one in a mile. I noticed this on both Intrepids, by the way.
- The car is absolutely awful on rough roads. We took a short cut on a gravel road (no, not off-roading, a maintained county road), and the the ride was miserable. Avoid at all costs if you need to drive on washboard roads occasionally!
- The sight lines to instruments and through the windows are average, although the right-side blind spot appears overly large.
- Driver access to the front-seat cupholders is difficult, as they are far back on the console. And, when anything is in the holder, it is difficult to reach the gearshift lever. I think they could have found a better place to put it!


<b>Parting Words</b>
After a more positive Intrepid experience the second time around, I'll give this one just slightly over 3-1/2 stars (rounded up to 4). It's a relatively economical car while still providing enough room for a family with growing kids. And some people think it's a hot looking little thing, too -- a touch of sportiness for Dad (or Mom) even though the carseats in the back make it a practical ride.
