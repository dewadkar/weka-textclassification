            <b>Intro</b>
I bought a 2000 4 door Honda Accord EX V6 in August 2000 to replace a Subaru Outback that was coming off lease.  The two biggest factors in my decision were price and power.  I was really tired of driving a car with sluggish acceleration and the V6 in this car was more than enough to satisfy me.  I was also looking for something that I could afford, and this Honda fit the bill there (after a bit of haggling).  I also seriously considered were the Nissan Maxima (too expensive).  I didn't really look at the Toyota Camry because I don't like its styling.   


<b>Driving the EX V6</b>
This ride of the Accord EX V6 is smooth.  The V6 provides ample power and the suspension is smooth.  On the highway this car is a joy.  It's extremely quiet for something in its price range (I think it's a small step below the Lexus ES 300 in terms of sound levels and smoothness, but it also costs a lot less).  I get about 20 mpg in the city an 25 on the highway.  Someone with a lighter foot should be able to do a bit better.   

<b>The Interior</b>
The EX V6 comes with a leather interior that is very nice for a sub-$25,000 car.  It has some imitation wood trim on the doors and between the front seats.  The dealer can put more on if you want (Honda sells a piece that goes on the dash around the radio and climate controls).  The front seats are comfy, though I find them to be almost too narrow for my stocky frame (I weigh over 200 pounds).  The rear seat folds down for increased cargo capacity, though it only folds as one piece.  Not a big deal, but a 60/40 split would be nicer.  There is, however, a pass-through that lets you puts skis into the car while only giving up use of the middle seat in the rear.

<b>In Closing</b>
This is one sweet car.  I have had the EX V6 for 6 months and have driven it 5,000 miles and I love it.  So far it has only been in for an oil change.  In the city, on the highway, this car is great.  It's no sports car, but its a lot of fun for a sedan with an automatic transmission.  I have taken this car skiing a few times and it is pretty good in the snow.  I would like to put snow tires on in though (and will if I have the money next winter).  If you're looking for a mid-sized sedan with the trappings of a luxury car for under twenty-five grand, you should take a look at this car.
