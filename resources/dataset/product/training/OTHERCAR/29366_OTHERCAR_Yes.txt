            This car is both excellent and annoying and here is why:

The CR-V handles much like a small sporty car - very tossable and responsive.  The 5 speed transmission has a light feel, steering is perfect, great brakes.  It has an excellent seating position, and rear seats are incredible - lots of space.

We have had it for almost two years, and have put over 42,000 miles on it, with excellent reliability.  Gas mileage has averaged 22 in mixed driving.  A little lower than I expected, seeing that I've been able to exceed the EPA estimate on every other Honda I've owned.

The all-wheel drive system works seamlessly, but is not well suited for serious off road use.

On the annoying side:

The four cylinder engine has very little torque - meaning you have to really rev the engine to get it to go.  Honda does make 4 cylinder engines with good low-end torque - the Accord engine would have been a much better choice than the Integra engine it has.

The 5 Speed transmission is geared for power, not low rpm highway cruising.  It is quite loud at highway speeds - so much that I don't like taking this vehicle on long trips.  

I would recommend this to anyone who does not do a lot of highway driving.  If you are considering one, make sure you test it at speeds up to 75 mph, to see if you can tolerate the noise.

It is undoubtedly one of the most reliably SUV's on the market, and that alone is a powerful motive for purchase.
