            I bought the car for it's styling and roominess. It is a comfortable car to drive and ride in.  The trunk is adequate.  The drop down rear seat makes it easy to carry long items and many packages.  All said the interior is well designed.  The ride and handling are also very good.

Now for the mechanical side of the Status. The mechanical side of this car is not good.  I've had the car for 5 years and have had the car in the shop more than I had my previous 4 cars combined.  Here is the list so far: The molding around the rear windows fell off.  That was under warranty and replaced.  The ignition would stick making it difficult to start the car.  That was also covered under the warranty.  Then the head gasket started to leak. (I was told Dodge didn't use a thick enough gasket when the car was manufactured.)  This was covered under the warranty.  Then there were recalls;  Brake cylinder, seat belt bolts, and one or two others that slips my memory.  Then there was trouble with the supension/stearing that had to be fixed. That cost several hundred dollars just before I went on vacation. Now I'm getting to pay $700 for the head gasket to be replaced again, two years after it was done the first time.  I will not buy a Dodge product again.  <br><br>
