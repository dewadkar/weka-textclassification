            The truck performed well until it hit about 700 miles.  During a vacation trip the drive shaft snapped off.  The 800 assistance number was not reachable at 6am on a Saturday.

When receiving a new truck one would think that the quality control check list includes placing a cap on the differential.  This was apparently missing which cause the fluid to splash out over time.  That caused the friction and subsequent snapping of the drive shaft (and fire).

However, the problem resolution of the people at a suburban Chevy dealer was outstanding.

We are now finding that little items such as the seat belt guard will not stay in place.  The cup holder will not stay in place.

There is a need to make trips for maintenance on items that should just work.

The quality control at the factory seems to be lacking.<br><br>
