            I bought the 1998 Chevrolet Z71 pickup truck because I owned an older Chevy K1500 and I liked the way the truck held up over the years.  I love the extra power that this truck has when you need it.  I can push the gas pedal and pass an eighteen wheeler on the freeway with ease.  The only problem that I have had is the check engine light will come on periodically for no reason at all.  Over all this is the best driving pickup truck I have ever driven in twelve years of driving pickups and especially four wheel drives.  I would recommend this truck to anyone who needs a powerful four wheel drive with cargo space, if you just need a vehicle to get groceries this is not the one for you.<br><br>
