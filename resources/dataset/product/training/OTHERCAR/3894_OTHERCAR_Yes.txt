            I just had to give up my 1990 Plymouth Horizon and I'm bummed.  I couldn't find a similar car.  Yeah, it's utilitarian, but it was cheap and got me from point A to point B without ever giving me problems.  I was sad to let it go.  It just kept running and running despite it's age and mileage.  For such a cheap car I was really surprised that it lasted that long.

When I first got it in 1992, it was getting 44 miles to the gallon.  By 2000, it was "only" getting 33 mpg.  It still could go 100mph on a flat surface.   I loved that I could put the back seat down and carry large items.  Plus, repairs were really cheap.    

Despite it's small size, parallel parking with it was a chore.  My brother used to make fun of how I had to keep going back and forth to get into a spot and didn't believe me that the car just wouldn't turn.  Then I had him try to park it.  He understood then. I'm not sure how they made such a small car so hard to park but they did.

The thing about the car that drove me the most crazy was that the left out a cheap gasket on the back doors, so they don't stay open. I can't tell you how many times I'd put a box down, open the door, pick up the box, put down the box, reopen the door, . . .  I really with they'd spent the 50 cents. 

Overall, the car gave me much more transportation than I really paid for.  I had few non-expected repairs/services.  I'm sure it's still out there somewhere on the road.
