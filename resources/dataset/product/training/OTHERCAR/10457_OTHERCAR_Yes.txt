            My dad has owned his 86 740 Turbo since 1988 and it now has over 160,000 miles on it.  I have driven it many times over the years when my cars weren't running.  The Volvo is still lightning quick and has been very reliable for a car of its age.  
  Major repairs included rebuilding the turbo and replacing the engine wiring harness.  The turbo started to leak oil from the gaskets so it needed to be rebuilt.  The wiring harness was a $1200 repair because the wires became old and brittle from all the hot-cold cycles.  This caused the plastic insulation to fall off and they shorted together.  
The car ended up running on two cylinders because the injectors were shorted.  Once we replaced the wiring everything else was fine. 
  Other small annoyances that would be hard to fix include a gas gauge that works intermitently, and door panels that are starting to fall apart.  
  
This car has awesome acceleration once it gets moving.  Once the engine hits about 2500RPM it really takes off.  The problem with this is that all the power doesn't help much around town.  If you are trying to make a quick left turn across a busy intersection make sure you have lots of room because the turbo won't kick in until you are in the crosswalk.  
  It is hard to drive this car slow due to its high-strung power band.  When you leave a stop sign you have to push the throttle down far to get the car moving, and then as the turbo comes in half-way through the intersection you have to let off the pedal really fast to keep from breaking the speed limit.  If you are a control freak you might not like this engine, because it takes a while to react.
The lack of low-end torque and throttle response is my biggest complaint about this engine.  
   Otherwise it is great, delivering about 20-25mpg.  It runs a little better on premimum fuel, but it will run fine, with plenty of power, on 87 octane.
  
  The suspension is really stiff on the 740 models (softer on 760) so long trips can be tiresome, especially for rear seat passengers.  The handleing is great, you can really get where you are going fast in this car.  
  Even with the hard suspension the car has remained very solid.  Their are only a few rattles and squeaks.  The biggest comes from the speedo cable.
  The bland styling makes this a real incogneto car.  The cops don't notice you as much.  I've only gotten one ticket in it.
