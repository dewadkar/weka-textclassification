            This car was recommended to us by my father-in-law and so far it's been great !  We live in Redding, CA and regularly drive to San Francisco.  We have driven it about 10 000 miles in 5 months with no reliability problems and it get insanely good mileage, especially on highways - I average 300+ miles on an 11 gallon tank in regular driving and 400+ on the highways.  

Our car has some extra options: it's an automatic, with a sunroof, ABS brakes, security system and CD player.  The sunroof option came with an extra set of "map lights" inside the car, which provide much better illumination than a regular internal light. If you're going to do a lot of long drives, the sunroof is a nice way to "open up" the cabin and feel less claustrophobic.  The SL2 has no less than SEVEN cupholders throughout the car - very convenient for long trips.

The much vaunted Saturn service program hasn't really done anything for us yet, as we live 150 miles from the nearest dealer and so our biggest problem is that we are forced to drive the 2.5 hours to that dealer for our scheduled servicing.  If you live far from a Saturn dealer you'll want to confer with them about the possibility of getting the minor services (oil change, spark plugs etc...) done locally at their expense.

Our car was delivered with very badly aligned wheels, which I, being a bit dim, didn't notice till we got home.  The checklist with the car said that steering and handling had been checked, but clearly it had NOT !  I assumed our Saturn dealer would be OK with us getting it re-aligned at their expense here in Redding, CA, but they were quite resistant to it until I reached the general manager at the dealer.  I am hoping to organize getting our regular minor services done locally too.

I'm not an afficianado of cars so I can't describe the handling and "feel" except to say it's fine - it doesn't get in my way, it's quick, responsive and has good pickup when I need it. The only anomaly is when I'm going downhill the engine really seems to rev high, only dropping if I apply the brakes more than I'd actually like to.  The perceptible engine noise inside the cabin is average...I wish it was quieter, and there's quite a bit of wind noise from the doors.

A minor point - I wish the radio let me force FM reception to MONO - when a radio signal is weak there's too much static as the radio flips between stereo and mono...but that's a pet peeve of mine and probably not an issue in city areas.

There's plenty of trunk space and since BOTH rear seats fold down it's very, very handy when moving large things around. You'd be amazed at how much you can fit inside this thing !!  However like most cars this size if you have too many tall people inside, someone is going to be uncomfortable - there's not enough leg room to share between front and back.

We paid $16 000 for it and put $6750 down.  We took advantage of their excellent 0.9% finance package, paid over three years.  We'll only have paid an extra $300 at the end of the three years !

Overall I'm quite satisfied with the car and would buy it again, but only after ensuring I could get minor services done elsewhere if no Saturn dealer was within a reasonable distance.

Update April 2003: The car is still going just fine and has 54000 miles so far.  Something I forgot in my original review - there's no light in the trunk !  This is *really* annoying when I'm getting home late with shopping and have to feel around the trunk - would a light have been such an extravagance, Saturn ?!

No major repair issues yet - I had a coolant leakage problem for a while, but after my last Jiffy Lube service it went away on its own and hasn't come back.  I have its oil changed every 3000 miles, but still haven't heard *anything* from Saturn about "being a member of the Saturn family."
