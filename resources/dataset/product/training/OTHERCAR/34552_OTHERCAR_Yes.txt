            My dad recently was in the market for an suv, so he test drove the usuals, Explorer, Tahoe, Suburban, Navigator, Durango, a few others, including the Mercedes M 320 and hte smaller Lexus suv. Well of the bunch he liked two. The Lincoln Navigator and the Infiniti QX4. So he reevaluated both vehicles,a nd for the money he got the best suv on the market. The QX4 has superior handling, is extremely nimble and agile for a vehicle of its size, the luxory and elegance of Infiniti, once you've driven one, you wont want to drive anything else, and a unbeatable price for the quality.
This suv is a gem to drive, a very quiet engine, plush leather interior, an amazing bose sound system, you generally forget you are in a &quot;truck.&quot; If you want to join the suv craze, save your time and  money,  skip directly over to your  local infiniti dealer, and test drive the QX4, you'll fall in love and want to drive this suv forever.<br><br>
