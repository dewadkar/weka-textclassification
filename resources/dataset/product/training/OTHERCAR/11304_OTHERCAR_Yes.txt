            I am now officially a suburban housewife.  I have upgraded from a much despised 1985 oldsmobile to a new to us 1994 Pontiac Trans Sport.

This van has many nice features, designed with the suburban housewife in mind.  It seats 7 comfortably.  We have keyless entry, and, much to my surprise, the sliding door is power run.  You're walking up to the van with a cart full of groceries and a couple of screaming kids, push a button, and the door opens for you.  In addition to the button on the key chain, there's one above the rear view mirror and one on the inside next to the door.  I don't like the one next to the door, as the kids can and do reach it.  I also don't like that if the van is unlocked, playing with the door handle turns the power door on and it will open.

The van automatically locks all the doors when you put it in gear, a mixed blessing.  I love it for safety reasons, but it's less than convenient when you're picking up and dropping off kids.  The drivers seat is adjustable with a little switch that moves it forward and back, and another one that will tilt it slightly to raise or lower your knees.  These are run off the battery, which worries me, since a similar system in my last car broke, leaving me to drive forever with a pillow behind me to reach the pedals.  The front seats are reclinable with a large turn knob.  I find this less convenient than the traditional handles you pull and then move the seat, but that's a matter of taste.  

The seats in the middle and back row all fold down easily, and each one can then function as a tray table, complete with cup holders.  The back row seats also fold all the way up to rest against the middle row, clearing more floor space in the back for cargo.  The middle row is the one with 3 seats across, and the seat by the door rolls all the way up like the back row to make it easier to get in and out of the back.

The back hatch opens easily, although the lock on ours doesn't work, leaving it perpetually unlocked.  Notice how I'm not telling you where we live?  There is a strap that hangs down so that short people such as myself can close the back hatch without jumping.

The Trans Sport came with a good quality am/fm radio and cassette player, intermittent and rear window wipers, and a second set of radio controls on the steering column, which is convenient.  

As for how it drives, I was very pleased to find that in addition to handling well in general, you can still feel the road a little bit.  So it doesn't have that video game feel that so many vans have.  It gets reasonable mileage, I made a 5 hour highway drive on less than a full tank, which ran about $20 in early April.  

The Trans Sport has cruise control, which I have found very disappointing.  It tends to lose power on hills when cruise control is on, and you have to actually push the gas pedal down and effectively force it to downshift if you don't want to be getting finger salutes from truckers.  It will maintain speed if you don't use cruise control, though.

Having recently taken it on a 12 hour each direction trip alone with 3 kids 5 and under, though, that's pretty much my only complaint at this point.

I highly recommend this van.
