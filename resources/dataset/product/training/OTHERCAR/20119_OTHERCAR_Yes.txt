            all i can say is WOW!!! this car has it all. where else can you find a car you can fit more than 2 or 3 people in and still have 400 hp?? nowhere!! this car is a family car believe it or not. it has the famous Mpower newly developed 8 cylinder engine and man does it get it and fast. the six speed tranny is really not needed here where the speedo cuts off at 154.among some of the features this car has is double oil pumps(designed for driving the Autobahn), double vanos, computer monitored tire pressure control, asc(anti spin control) has a sport feature button(hit the button for sport shifting and feel your head slam into the headrest of the seat), full tilting mirrors, power everything, moonroof, harmon/kardon stereo especially designed for BMW, special M5 rims that are designed to cool the rotors and braking system(ought to be special for over $600 a piece), and many more special features that puts it ahead of every other car on the market. these cars are very rare, and as i know since i work at a BMW dealership, are backordered like crazy. so if you intend on purchasing this beast, be prepared to put down a good deposit and wait for it to come in. projected deliveries for this car, if ordered now, are supposed to be in jan or feb of next year.
one drawback to this car is the oil changes. The M5 engine takes a special racing synthetic made by Castrol and takes 8 qts. each quart costs approx $10. but i guess if you pay $80000 for a car, whats an extra $110!!
the actual cost of this car is a little over $80,000, and if you can afford it, buy it cause you will be the envy of everyone that sees you driving it or sees it parked in your garage. yet another great auto produced by those germans at BMW<br><br>
