            In Aug of 1999 my wife and i traded in our 1998 dodge dakota for a 4 door sedan. we looked at dodge neon and kia sephias. neons were about 3,00 more and offered the same as kia. After 800 miles the check engine light and OD light started flashing that took three times in the shop at over one month (they fixed it so we couldn't do the lemon law). one of the doors is not lineing up any more, the fuel guage is not accurate, and the Kai representatives are not friendly at all. buy this car if you want the chance to rent other makes of cars(your kia will see more of the service men than you. please please do not buy this vehicle!!! if you want to ask me some questions feel free to write.<br><br>
