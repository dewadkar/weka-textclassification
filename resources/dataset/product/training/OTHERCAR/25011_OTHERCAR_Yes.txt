            Earlier this year I traded in my 2001 2.0 GLS Beetle for a 2002 1.8T Snap Orange New Beetle and I love it!  I loved my other beetle too, but after driving a friend's turbo-charged Beetle I knew I needed an upgrade.  The salesmen at our local dealer were very nice and gave me significantly more than I owed for my car, making it worth my while to trade. Not to mention the standard VW warranty went from 2 to 4 years in 2002, quite a plus.  But if you're still looking for free oil changes you're out of luck.

 The Snap Orange Beetle has some very interesting cosmetic features, including orange inserts in the leather seats, orange stitching around the inside of the car, completely black interior (aside from headliner) and orange inserts in the sporty wheels.  I get looks wherever I go.  The turbo engine has 150 horse power and is peppy enough for the in town drive or the cross country haul.  Although I don't particularly like the way VW packages their options, they do carry some neat options that you don't normally see on compact cars like heated seats (including the cloth ones), self dimming rear-view mirrors and rain-sensing wipers (the last 2 of which you must buy the GLX version to get). The most common comment I get on my car is "Wow, I didn't realize the inside was so big!"  Yes, the backseat is a little cramped but I didn't buy it for the space in the back, I don't have children and it doesn't hurt my feelings if I don't have to cart around all my friends to the mall.

The only large complaint I have is with VW service.  They are not consistent and no matter how many dealerships I've been to (we move around a lot in the military) I seem to get the run around wherever I go.  Prices for regular services can vary within hundreds of dollars (once quoted $300 for a 60k service by one dealer and then $1200 by another) and they sometimes refuse to help you fix even the smallest of problems, saying that VW claims that the problem is normal (IE:  My headlights fog up when it rains and don't unfog for days, my old beetle didn't do this, and they are trying to tell me this is ok.  There are other similar items)  They don't perform recalls on items that clearly should be recalled because so many people report the same problem.... like the power window problem in the early beetles that took them 2 years to recall.

Overall I enjoy the car and don't have any major problems.  The VW community is great and I am always meeting lots of interesting people and talk at length about my car.  If you're shy this isn't the car for you!
