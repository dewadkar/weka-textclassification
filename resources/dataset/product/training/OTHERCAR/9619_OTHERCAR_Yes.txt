            I have recently driven the new 2000 Celica GT and I must say it lacks hardly anything. Even though it only has a 4-cylinder 140 bhp engine it handles and brakes as well as any $50,000 German car. The new body style will turn any body's head. With a moon roof and a great stereo it is just great to drive around in and relaxing. Compared to the new eclipse and cougar it is definitely in a class of its own. It has a great light sensor that will turn on your lights automatically. The stereo has 6 speakers and sounds better then some exspensive custom stereos you can put together.<br><br>
