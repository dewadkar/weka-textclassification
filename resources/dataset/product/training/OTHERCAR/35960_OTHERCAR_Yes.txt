            The car is the best. I bought this car (my first brand new car) last May (1999).  Since then I just love it.  I have had no problems, gas is great, and it is comfortable.  Their are enough compartments to find things in your car, and can fit 5 adults.  The one thing I do not like is the fact that I love my car so much that I drive EVERYWHERE&gt; Normally you switch on &amp; off with friends / boyfriends, but NNNOOOO. Not me. Only one year I have had this car and already 16,000 miles!  The car is compact for smaller, shorter people (for driving), you know when you are kind of short and having a hard time actually using the sun visor?  Well now I can actually use the sun visor and it does its purpose... it excites me! The car also is comfortable for larger people (like my husband); broad.  I think anyone who wants a reliable, dependable, comfortable, luxury car should buy this car.  It is inexpensive for a good brand name car and safety feature are great.  I had a sports car before this Honda so it did take me a while to get used to the difference in accleration rate, but everything else overcomes it.

Great CAR!<br><br>
