            p&gt;I love my silver Tracker convertible, even though its four cylinders limits its road power.  I commute a couple of hours a week in it, over and above my normal drives to work and around town. It is an automobile you KNOW you are driving when you are driving it. The ride is not luxurious but that's what you get with a short wheel-based truck and it can get noisy with the convertible top, but its great sound system makes up for that shortcoming. Its light weight makes it subject to heavy winds which can be a weird feeling when you are blowing around on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>Gas mileage is about 30-33 mpg and I use regular unleaded. This little grrrl is not for cruising at 90 in the left lane, you have to handle her like a go-cart! But she handles well and accelerates beautifully. I do make her work on the interstate at about 80 mph but she offers no resistance.  She's a biscuit to stop quickly, though, and will slide around so I have to give myself plenty stopping room in heavier traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>She's tightly compact and will squeeze easily into places larger SUVs can't get to, great for parking and easy to park. The extra short wheel base gives it that sporty drivability. Visibility in the convertible can be trying, and I even have to disengage my seatbelt sometimes (for a minute) to make sure I'm seeing clearly. The Tracker offers a lot of fun here along the coast, especially on a clear day with the top off, but it is fussy about having its top back on, so don't wait for rain and think you'll get the four pieces on quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>An advantage that suits me is the lay down back seat that folds forward to create a tiny pickup truck bed which is great for hauling big dogs, groceries, or lots of Christmas presents.  The price was right for me, and so far I'm happy with the idea of keeping it as a second car when I get a "real car" later. For now, it's my toy.
