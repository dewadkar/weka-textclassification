            I purchased a '97 Volvo 960 Wagon in 1998.  It was two years old - barely &quot;broken in&quot; by Volvo standards.  I bought it for all the right reasons: reliability, safety, luxury.  I really reached for the sky when I bought it.  I have two kids and wanted to drive something that would take us into their teenage years and still be a &quot;safe&quot; car for them to learn to drive with.  By the way, the car only had 27K on it and a transferable warranty until 50K - no problem, right?

The problems began when after driving it for a week, I noticed that the front end wasn't really aligned.  No problem, the used car lot I bought it from had an alignment done at the local dealer - gratis.  Still pulled to the right...  

Then the suspension noise problems began....  It took three trips to the dealer (which, by the way, was over 30 minutes away....) to simply diagnose it.  They supposedly 'fixed' the problem, but after two weeks, the noise returned.  When they promised to not only fix the problem, but also detail my car, I was ecstatic!  Not only DIDN'T they fix the problem, they barely vacuumed the front floor, never mind wash the outside and clean the interior. 

By this time, my air conditioner wasn't working (car only two years old?????) and the dealer tells me (in the middle of a two week heat wave in July in the Northeast) that they &quot;can schedule me three weeks from now.....&quot;  They then have the audacity to hand me a customer service survey, to be mailed to Volvo North America, and &quot;just to let me know, anything less than a 'very satisfied' is a 'failure' in Volvo's determination.....&quot; (hehehehehe...)

Time to find a new dealer.... which I did, and by the way, is now OVER AN HOUR from home (because Volvo is loyal to dealer territory....) who diagnoses and fixes both the suspension and air conditioning problem (after three more trips) - gratis again. The A/C gets a shot of freon, but they can't find the leak.  This time, the car is about to go off of warranty and it's September in the Northeast....  I tell them, &quot;I hope that when I start my A/C up in May that there is no problem with it...,&quot; to which they reply: &quot;Cannot hold a work order open that long....!!&quot;  

Luckily when I started it up in May (and of course it didn't work....) the kid at the service desk remembered me and was gracious about getting the work done gratis (after I reminded him that I had already contacted Volvo North America's Customer Service......)

In the meantime, during the winter, the car's oil light came on and I got stranded in -0 degree weather in February, with both kids in the car...  Took my mechanic (you don't really think I would take it to a dealer at this point, do you?) two weeks, to disassemble, clean and rehabilitate the oil system (the whole bottom of the engine has to come off since it's a high performance engine, mind you....) to the tune of $1200.00 - that's right, TWELVE HUNDRED dollars..... worth of ..... labor.  Didn't bother to call Volvo over that one.  I'm too disgusted at this point.  

This is just a listing of the big things.  I haven't even gotten to the small things like, electric seats that don't work, lights on the gearshift that failed after warranty, etc....

I need to sell the car and get something else.  Problem is, what? The car drives like a dream, has a high performance engine, turns on a dime (and I DO mean a dime), is fully loaded with every imaginable option, seats 7 (I drive a car pool), isn't outrageous on gas (gets about 22 MPG), leather, CD, power everything... From a safety standpoint, the car is built with a steel cage all the way around.. If I get into an accident, this is the baby I want to be in....

What do I drive now??????
