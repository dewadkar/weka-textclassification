              The Saab 9-5 is one of the best cars to come off the line in Trollhottan since the classic 900.  This car has a whole lot of GM influence without leaving the Saab tradition.  The interior still has the classic cockpit feel.  I would recommend the 4 cylinder 5 speed for those who want to have a little bit more fun in the car.  For those who just want a nice luxurious people mover, the V-6 is great.  The V-6 is Opel based, the 4 cylinder is the same old Saab powerplant with certain improvements over the years.  I have only had small problems with mine that the dealer took care of free of charge.  I have owned the old 900, 9000, 9-3, and now the 9-5.  The 9-5 is by far the best.  It is very comfortable, and very fast.  The back seat is a little crammed for tall people.  But overall it is a great car.  You will enjoy it.<br><br>
