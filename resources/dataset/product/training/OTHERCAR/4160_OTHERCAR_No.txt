            I bought the Isuzu Rodeo because I have a family of 6 and needed the room, yet still wanted to be able to go 4 wheeling and mudding as well.

I loved my Rodeo 4x4 up until the transmission went Kaput on it.  And I am not saying that I might not get the same response from another automobile company, I honestly doubt it, but you never know.  I took it to the dealer, and the dealer as well as Isuzu were refusing to fix it.  With it being under full powertrain warranty, they tried everything in the book, to make it out to be my fault, even with receipts, etc... they were still saying I had done something wrong.  But, finally after nearly 3 months, I did get my transmission replaced.  

As much as I still love my Rodeo, the next vehicle I buy, will definitely not be an Isuzu.  

I would recommend the Rodeo itself, but beware if anything goes wrong with it,be prepared for a fight to get anything fixed on it. I believe mine was a rarity which was why I bought the Isuzu brand in the first place,I had never heard anything bad about Isuzu products.  Afterall, my mother had an Isuzu product that had over 350,000 miles on it when she sold it.
