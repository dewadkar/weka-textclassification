            I looked long and hard for a car that would be a good grocery-getter, but with some niceties as well as some oomph.  Oh, and I didn't want to spend upwards of 35-40k!

After considering a bunch of different cars that included BMW 3-series, the Audi A series, and even the little Mercedes C230, I ended up taking a close look at the RSX.

Why?  Simple - the price/performance (by performance I mean more than just road performance)!  Sure, the amenities of the German cars initially seem far better than those of the RSX, and granted, they do come with more bells and whistles, but the bottom line is that while the RSX is a good ten grand cheaper, it sure doesn't feel like it!

Acura has done a great job in taking the Integra and turning it into something that corporate types won't feel weird driving to work every day (not that I'm one of those, or at least I try not to be).

Seriously - the RSX doesn't disappoint in the luxury or performance departments.  With standard (on the Type S) power windows/mirrors/locks, keyless, leather seats and steering wheel, moonroof, automatic climate control, and a good tight feel to all the interior parts, you feel like you're driving a car that costs a lot more than the RSX.  THEN comes the FUN part - punch it and this car is a rocket!  Of course, there will be those that want to compare torque and hp figures - whatever!  You press the gas, the car takes off!  Add to that a feeling that the car is sticking good and well to the road, and you've got it all - sport and luxury!  It's a blast to drive under almost any condition.

SO... if you HAVE to have the German badge on the trunklid, go ahead and spend the money.  If you want a fantastic car for under $25K - LOADED, take a good long look at the RSX - you will not be disappointed!!
