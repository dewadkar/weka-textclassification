            I bought a 1999 Kia Sportage because it was cheap, looked like a shiny red apple, and I needed a car quick. I definitely thought it was cute, at first. I thought perhaps i was being a car snob when I became embarrassed by driving around in a cheap SUV. Then the problems started and I knew it was more then my snobbishness. Things started to fall apart, it made strange noises, needed to go into the shop repeatedly for &quot;check engine&quot; light. The vents were weak, a/c dreary, and the pick up lethargic. I traded it in less then a year later, for $3,000 less then I paid for it, what a nightmare. DO NOT BUY THIS AUTOMOBILE UNLESS YOU REALLY NEED TO HAVE AN SUV AND YOU DON'T CARE IF IT FALLS APART RAPIDLY, enough said.<br><br>
