              This car once was said to have &quot; three Toyotas worth of steel in it&quot; by a mechanic working on it.. That is my car, diesel, loud, and sturdy as a tank. That is why we nicknamed her The Tank. Once, my Mother got hit from behind and she didn't even realize it! It's got an 8-track! leather seats and power windows! Boy let me tell you, that was a commodity of the early 80's!
  It's one of the safest cars out there now and I feel like I am in a big steel bubble. My parents let me have it because it is safe and I am a new driver...so far so good! No accidents and it gets like 60 miles per gallon! And in today's climbing gas prices that is VERY appealing!
  So all in all the older the better, they need to be taken care of but if you do your auto-homework you will have a reliable car to last you a long time...<br><br>
