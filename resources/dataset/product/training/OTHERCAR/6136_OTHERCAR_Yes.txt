            This car is used by my family all the time.  It gives good mile-per-(gallonMPG (City/Hwy)20/32)!  The best part about it is the flashing sign on the dashboard! This is a great idea!  It flashes a sign when you need gas that sayslow fuel, when a person is opening up a door it says door ajar ,and when you need a oil change it says chang oil!  another cool thing about it is the keyless entry!  It has a cd player and killer speakers. It is a 4 door sedan.  IT has  6 Cylinder, 3.4 Liter, 180 Horsepower Engine or 6 Cylinder, 3.8 Liter, 200 Horsepower Engine. It is not too much money too.  It's oringal list price is 18705.  IT has a great cargo capacity and you can extend the trunk by bringing down the back seats.  It's seating capacity is 5.  You could have 3 in the back and 2 in the front.  The leg room is great.  Get this great car!<br><br>
