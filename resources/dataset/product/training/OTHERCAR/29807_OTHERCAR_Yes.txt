            I think the DC260 is as good a digital camera as others in it's range, however, I feel the price is really jacked up on this one due to the Burst feature(takes sequential pictures). Ok-let's compare-it has 1.6 million pixels(1536 x 1024) per image, which is great detail, color and sharpness, but there are several other cameras with the same quality, some more expensive, but several not. It has a 3x optical plus 2x digital zoom-pretty standard, and a flash sync feature that lets you connect to an external flash. Included is the 8MB picture card from Kodak, which is the way all the Kodak cameras are coming now. It resembles the DC265 in appearance and pixel resolution, but has options that resemble the DC240. <br><br>
