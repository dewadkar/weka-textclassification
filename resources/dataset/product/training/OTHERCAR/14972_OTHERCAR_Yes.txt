            Having recently been married and moved away from home, I had a strong desire to e-mail photos to families and friends.  I knew that the only choice was to buy a digital camera....but which one?  There were so many styles and options to choose from when looking for a suitable camera.  I decided to give the Mavica FD-73 by Sony a try.  I wasn't disappointed.

The MVC-FD-73 seemed solid enough to last and had a very simple layout to it, making it seem easy to operate.  However, I was a little worried about the fact that it had a 3.5&quot; floppy disk drive.  It seems that the more moving parts something has, the sooner something will break. I was finally convinced as I watched a demo that actually played on the camera screen.  In a few minutes, it had shown me about everything it could do and I was hooked.  Retail price was $499.00.  A lot to pay but after one year since I bought it, it still is selling for the same price in stores.  It must be a great camera.

<b>Features</b>

The supplied battery pack usually lasts about 120 minutes.  However, when using the flash and constantly taking photos, the minutes go down very quickly.  The battery pack can recharge in about 3.5 hours.

Although I haven't ever used it, I can see that it's ability to copy the contents from one floppy to a second floppy would be very handy for some.  When taking pictures with friends, they can quickly and easily have a disk made with the exact pictures on it without having to go home to the computer.

Pictures can be taken in many different ways.  The camera can take B&amp;W, Neg. Art, Sepia, and Solarized.  Great to give the photos a little artistic touch.  Also, with the touch of a button, the camera will adjust to soft portrait, quick action, bright reflection, sunset and moon, landscape, and panfocus modes.  It may also be adjusted manually to brighten or darken the photo little by little.  

The 10X zoom is excellent and is very handy.  One thing I didn't see on many other cameras in the same price range.

The recording quality can be set along with the flash level.  It can record images: normal (640 x 480 jpg), e-mail (320 x 240 jpg), and bitmap modes.  It also can take multiple pictures: 9 pictures in 2 seconds, giving it a slideshow effect.

In normal mode, about 24 photos can fit on a disk.

<b>Things I like</b>

The #1 thing I like is the floppy disk drive.  Just pull it out and pop it in your computer and open the jpg files.  It couldn't be easier.  The files are easily viewed and deleted on the camera in an index screen showing 6 shots at a time.  The view-screen is large and in color.  It has a self-timer that may be activated to take the picture after 10 seconds.  The layout is simple and very easy.  Nothing you don't need.  The camera can also be mounted on a tripod.  

<b>Things I dislike</b>

Even though sufficient for me, the quality is not as good as the more expensive cameras (of course).  The quality is significantly reduced in low light or indoors.  The flash just seems to add to the problem.  I've had the best luck with it in the sunlight and outside.  For point and shoot photo taking, the response time is a little slow.  One must first hold the capture button down half-way until it focuses and white-balances.  Then it can be depressed completely and the image captured.  This takes at least .75 sec.  sometimes a few seconds.


<b>Conclusion</b>

The MVC-FD-73 is a very easy and fun camera to use.  It doesn't have unneeded features and I haven't found any needed features it lacks.  Even though the resolution is not the best, it is great for e-mails or web-sites.  I have photographed weddings, naturescapes, and portraits and everyone has always been pleased.  It is a great camera for the nonprofessional that just wants to have a little fun.
