            First of all I think everyone should know I'm talking about a 1993 Eclipse. I have not tried many of the more recent model and therefore I do not think I have a very good basis of comparison. However the Eclipse I do have access to is an excellent car. First of all the new car price was only about ten grand. Normally when you spend that little on a car you purchase a very below average car. This was not the case with the Eclipse. The car has enough power so that you feel as if you were in an actual sports car. Not only that the car gets excellent gas milage, around 26-27 miles to the gallon. This car is an excellent value and I could recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
