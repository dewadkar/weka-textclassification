                I have been a part of the Saturn family since 1991 - when I purchased one of the first ones.  I never had any problem with it and had many many people stop and ask me questions about the car. I then leased my next 2 Saturns - again with never a complaint! The only criticism I had for the 3 cars was that they were too low to the ground, and being a large person, I had trouble getting in and out!
    In October of this year, I went for a test drive of the new LS2 mid-size Saturn and feel deeply in love. By the middle of November, I possessed the new car!  I am purchasing this one and intend it to be the car I have when I retire in 9 years!
    Not only does this car look terrific - but it is a joy to drive.  It is so much larger than previous Saturns - easy to get in and out of - tons of trunk space - much comfortable room for folks in the back seat! I especially love the 6-cylinder engine which ZOOMS at the touch of the pedal! The bad part of that is - it uses much more fuel than the others.
     The car was recalled last week for a defect in the gas tank.  I took it in and waited 1 1/2 hrs for it to be repaired.  Also, the windshield wipers stopped - and the entire mechanism had to be repaired.  Because the car is so new, they have not made individual repair parts yet.
      These are minor problems.  I love this car!!!
