            I bought a 1996 Mitsubishi Galant ES last year, when my van died.  I had been driving mini-vans for the last ten years, and really wasn't considering a car, but circumstance dictated that I couldn't get another van at the time.  Ten years ago, before I bought my first van, I had been looking at the Galant, and had ridden in one for a long trip.  At the time I did say that someday, if I had to get a car, this would be it.  My Galant has done everything I asked it to.  Now don't get me wrong, a van's the thing for cargo.  But when you need a passenger car, this model is just the ticket!  I starts up faithfully every day, it does everything right.  A comfortable interior - my oversized son (I can't tell you how large, but we're talking Big &amp; Tall Shop)even fits comfortably in the back seat.

On the technical side, the acceleration is quick, the motor is strong - even with the AC cranked up, you barely notice the difference.  My daughter told me to be careful or one of her friends would want to race the car.

In the year I've had it I've put on 25,000 miles, but you wouldn't know it if you drove this car.  It still runs as quietly and evenly as the day I drove it off the lot.  I get 28+ miles per gallon, and 99% of my driving is local, stop and go.  I don't think that's too bad.

And by the way, just because it's not built for cargo doesn't mean you can't carry anything in it.  Half of the lumber and supplies to rebuild my kitchen came home in the trunk!  I really only needed a van for the appliances.  Fold down back seat lets it carry quite a bit of the cargo variety.  Two 17&quot; computer monitors came home in that back seat.<br><br>
