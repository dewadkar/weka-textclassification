            WOW! Acura has done it again. The pinnacle of luxury. The smooth sailing of a new Acura 3.5 RL is breath taking. Not to mention the comfort it imposes. Truly a car this wonderful is surly worth the price.<br> Even if it is 50 grand. Automatic dual climate controls, trunk mounted 6-disc CD player, heated seats, global positioning system, polished oak dash (passenger side), roomy enough to lie in, 8-way power seats- the list goes steadily on. The ammenities stuffed into this auto are simply devine. Anyone who can appreciate the mechanics of how an engine creates power can see that the quietness and smoothness and sheer power are before their time. This car is designed for the truly discriminating tastes in comfort and looks. Although you'll be paying over $500 bucks a month for it, it seems appropriate when you look at today's &quot;luxury&quot; cars and their definition of quality. You get what you pay for, and this is a wise purchase from a reputable company.<br><br><br>
