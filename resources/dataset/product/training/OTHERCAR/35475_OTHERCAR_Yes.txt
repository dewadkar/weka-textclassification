            I was hot for my new toy and when landed in my hands definitely meet my expectations. Great camera, well equipped with functions and hardware accessories. Don't waste time and let's jump to details:

Body :::::::::::
Very similar to previous DSC-F505, same unconventional style, for some people hard to handle but most people like it very much, easy access to all buttons except zoom control. Maybe it's only me, but controlling zoom using left hand (which hold lens) it's way too uncomfortable. F707 is equipped with a viewfinder, the EVF variety which is nothing else just a small LCD with an eyepiece (regulated depends on your vision). Whole body is made with strong magnesium alloy, very solid  and well very detailed finish.

Features ::::::::
Couple new inventions was added to this version of DSC family. I'mean laser grid - laser creates a sharp pattern on to the subject, this pattern is sharp and bright enough for the contrast detection auto focus system to adjust the focus accurately. 0-lux night shot creating ability to shoot your pictures in total darkness as well as night-framing taking measure in dark conditions to adjust your parameters for flash. The pop-up flash got range of 0.5 - 5 m (1.6 - 16.4 ft) which is pretty powerful by digital camera standards. Also F707 performs flash metering TTL (through the lens) by firing a pre-flash just milliseconds before the main flash. It uses this pre-flash to meter the scene. A little bit smaller screen with anti reflective coating (1/8" instead of 2") display all possible menu variations like camera setup, library controls or actual image details.

I can talk hours how low battery consumption is and about many many other things. Before I bought it I've made a solid research surfing couple days and gathering information about F707 and believe me I'm not disappointed now. I think it has no competition in its class and price-range, maybe except coming soon CoolPix.
