            I finally had to admit that it was time to trade my much loved Bonneville in for a new car.  My first choice was another Bonneville, but I let price be the determining factor. (First mistake).  I looked at the Grand Prix's and liked the similarity of the body style to the Bonneville.  I test drove the Grand Prix on a very stormy night (Second mistake).  I didn't really get to see if it had the power of my Bonneville. I purchased the car several days later (Third mistake) and I am so disappointed.  It doesn't drive, handle or ride like a Bonneville.  The windows must be closed when you use the windshield washers or you get soaked.  I am constantly changing radio stations while driving by accidentally bumping the controls on the steering wheel. Gas mileage is 16.5 highway and 14.9 city.  Needless to say, I am shopping for a new Bonneville.  This just isn't the car I thought it would be.
