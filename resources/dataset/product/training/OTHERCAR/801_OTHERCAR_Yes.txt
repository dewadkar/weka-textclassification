            I was very pleasantly surprised when I test drove a v6 SLE -- it had plenty of power, handled pretty well for a front-driver, was pretty cushy with stuff like leather, in dash 6 player CD, great AC, power everything. The get up and go was what really surprised me.

So I bought one and am very happy. First tank of gas was mostly around town and I got 22 MPG... Not a bad start on a tight engine.

The only bummer is the "JBL Stereo" that, stock, sounds terrible. I have upgraded it w/ new amps and a subwoofer and it's good now, but as it came, it was very marginal.

I am looking forward to many trouble free, safe years driving this car.

UPDATE June 1, 2003: I've had this car for about 2 years, and I am EXTREMELY happy with it. I get good mileage (about 19 to 21 around town, about 28 to 30 freeway), there is a ton of room in the trunk, and I am still very surprised by the performance of the engine, in combination with the automatic transmission.

Controls are all logical, the AC/Htr work very well, visibility from the driver's seat is fine. It's just a nice car. There is one small squeak coming from the passenger air bag area, but it's not been bugging me enough to do anything about it. 

I will say I have been less than pleased with my infrequent visits to the dealer (first oil change, and fixing another small squeak from the driver's dash area). But since the car is so dead-on reliable, I don't think this is an issue. There are also plenty of other car repair places around for Toyota...

If you want this kind of car, get one -- you won't regret it.
