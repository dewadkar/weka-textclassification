            I bought this car 4 days ago and I LOVE IT!  I have already put on a lot of miles just test driving around getting used to all its features and handling.  I have a 5-speed, cobalt blue Tiburon with every possible feature it could come with.  I was very skeptical about buying a Hyundai due to some friends and family suggestions and seeing the things they had to go through, however, when I got the details of the warranty, it easily persuaded me to purchase this adorable car.  

This car comes with many standard features, which are great to have.  Cruise control, air, power windows, locks, and mirrors are standard features.  To have a CD player, sunroof/moonroof, rear window wiper, fog lamps, and leather you have to pay a little more, but I got a deal on my package due to a local dealer running a great sale.  So be sure to shop around before buying right away.  A week before my car was stickered for $18,100 and a week later, I drove it off the lot for $15,000 fully loaded.

So far it has lived up to my expectations.  I get many compliments on how cute it is and how reasonably priced it was for all the features it has.  And the cobalt blue color is very classy and sporty at the same time.  It has incredible pickup for only being a 4 cylinder.  It gets me from Point A to Point B very smoothly and that is all that matters.

This car is definitely not a family car, as the back seat is very small and cramped.  I, like most of my friends, are only 5'4" so we are comfortable, but anyone taller than that will have some issues (for example, fitting your legs in the car and hitting your head on the ceiling).  It is the perfect college kid's car because it is stylish, affordable, and actually does have a pretty good sized trunk.  (They should have used some of the trunk space to make more room in the back seat though...).

I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase so far and will keep you posted on how things go!
