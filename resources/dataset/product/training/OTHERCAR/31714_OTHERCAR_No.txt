        I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc...  points of view. I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from an undercar point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear.
       There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles, I hope to help you decide based on my experience, which one will be better for you from the standpoint of  strength of, and reliability of, one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole, the steering and suspension system.

       In working on the Dodge Intrepid I have found some good points and some sore spots on this suspension. Some of the excellent features are the fact that it is a four wheel alignable suspension from the factory, although the only actual adjustments are front and rear toe. It has an extremely wide stance, which for you means it is a very stable ride, and holds the road well, inspiring confidence when driving the interstates or carving your way through a twisty canyon backroad.

    It comes with a better than average anti sway bar package that aids in keeping things on the level while you are on these twisty roads. This is somewhat of a sportier touring kind of car, and it delivers on this promise, although it is probably classified as a &quot;grocery getter&quot;.

 The suspension system consists of a strut type design both front and rear, making it a true four wheel independent suspension. The struts both front and rear are quality Chrysler design, and hold up very well. There are some vehicles which from the factory have sub par struts, but Chrysler seems to have a good quality design on most of their vehicles. I have not needed to replace struts on any Intrepid's as of yet, due to premature wear out so this will not become a problem to deal with any time soon after a purchase.

    I do have some gripes though on the steering end of the underneath of the Intrepid's. It seems the ball joints, outer tie rods, and the pivot ends of the anti swat bar links both at the strut, as well as the bar end wear out sooner than you would expect. None of the steering components are factory greasable, so you cannot service this chassis at all, during normal maintenance. The factory sealed units seem to use up the original grease and then start going metal on metal much too soon and wear out is rapid.

     The outer tie rod ends are easy enough to replace, and not too expensive, but tend to wear out very early, in as little as 30,000 miles. The lower ball joints are not a changeable unit because they are integrated into the lower control arm, necessitating replacement of the entire lower control arm. This can get expensive seeing other parts also integrated into the control arm will have to come with it, namely the strut rod bushings and the pivot bushings. It would be far better to either make these components greasable so they can be taken care of, or else allow for ball joint only replacement instead of the complete control arm.

   Same story with the anti sway bar links, not greasable and prone to early retirement.   If you decide to get yourself an Intrepid despite this, it would be advisable to make sure to get it checked out at a neutral trustworthy garage to make sure these above listed components are still O.K. before the warranty expires so if they are loose you can get some satisfaction before it is too late.<br><br>
