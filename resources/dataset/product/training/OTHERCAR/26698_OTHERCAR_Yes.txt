            I bought this camera 3 months ago mostly as a way to share photos with family, all of which live many states away. After a bit of research, I chose the D-360L based on its price vs features. It seemed to have plenty of control for manual setting, yet still remained useable as a simple point and shoot straight out of the box. I�d have been hard pressed to make a better decision.

This camera has everything I could have wanted from a �low-end� digital camera. There are tons of manual settings to play with yet every option has an �auto� setting that takes great photos on it�s own. Some features include:

- The ability to manually overexpose or underexpose by +/- 2 �stops� in .5 increments
- Spot Metering
- Three different photo quality settings
- Lighting compensation setting for shooting in various lighting situations (cloudy, fluorescent, etc)
- Ability to choose from 3 different ISO settings to simulate different film speeds
- Able to shoot up to 10 photos in rapid-fire sequence
- Panoramic Mode (you need to piece the individual photos together, though)

All in all, everything you could ask for in a simple consumer digital camera.

The camera has a very nice feel and the only design flaw I could remotely question is the placement of the lens. If you have large hands you may find your fingers getting in the way at times, but for most people this wouldn�t even be a concern. The buttons and menus are very intuitive and all you should need is a quick skim through of the user�s manual to familiarize yourself with the functions. The camera has an 8MB Smartmedia card included. I usually get 36-40 pictures at High Quality before the card is full. If this was to be user as the main camera on a vacation you may want to look into getting a Smartmedia card with more memory, but if you plan to use it in addition to a regular film camera then 40 pictures should do just fine for most situations.

Photo quality is outstanding in daylight conditions and acceptable in darker settings. I find that with less light the pictures tend to look �grainy� � sort of like when you see images captured from video on the internet. There�s just a grainy quality to them. In very bright light (high noon on a Florida summer day) pictures can sometimes be washed out looking, but the exposure compensation can easily fix this; it�s just a matter of knowing when to use it.

I wasn�t sure I�d be able to get used to not having actual physical copies of my photos but you quickly get used to it. I now burn my photos to CD-R and it makes a very convenient way of cataloguing and storing photos. There are still times when an actual print is a must and for those times I use a regular film-loading camera.

However after this glowing review I must add that the camera is not quite perfect. I have two minor problems with the D-360L.

1.	Battery Life - I�m not sure how it compares to other digital cameras, but it seems to just tear through batteries. On average I can fill the memory 4 or 5 times before the batteries need replaced. This works out to 150 to 200 photos before the batteries need replaced. The D-360L takes 4 �AA� batteries so if you plan lots of photos with it battery cost may be a concern. On the other hand, the money saved in film processing will more than make up for the battery cost.
2.	RGB separation in corners of photos - I only notice it when there is a lot of detail in far corners of the photos (leaves, fencing), but there is definitely color separation. In photos with not so many details in the corners (sky, wall, and solid colors) it isn�t noticeable. I may just be nitpicking here as most people I point it out to don�t even see it until I make them aware. Only the most discriminating of photographers would see this as a serious problem and if you�re that choosy about your pictures then you�d probably go for a higher end model than the D-360L. So again, it�s a very minor quibble, but something that certainly needs pointed out.


All in all it�s an incredible value and that�s what I�m after with most purchases. I tend to try to find the best price vs quality & features ratio that I can and I have to say the D-360L doesn�t disappoint me one bit. I�d definitely recommend it to anyone who knows a little about photography and wants to jump into the digital side of things.
