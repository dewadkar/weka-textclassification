            The Toyota Camry Solora is one of the nicest cars that I have ever seen.  That is my opinion.  I love the body on this car and the ride is out of this world.  The Camry Solora has a dead quiet ride.  The price is right also.  You can get one for 18,000 dollars on a great deal.  The car is also built very well.  You could just feel it on the doors.  The car is made in Canada, just thought I let you know.  The seats in this car feel like Lazy Boys.  I could practically sleep in this car.  Its just a fine piece of art.  The options in this car are great, and the stereo is very good.  It also has good MPG.<br><br>
