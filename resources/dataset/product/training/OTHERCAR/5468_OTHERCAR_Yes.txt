               I bought my used 1993 Geo Storm in my early twenties (1995), and was thrilled to have it. It was spiffy looking, quick, and sporty. I did not think much about durability, gas mileage, or other such adult topics. I just wanted a sporty car that I looked good in, and I did get that. But I also got a very mechanically sound vehicle, that has lasted for years, and continues to get gas mileage of over 30 mpg, even though it has over 100,000 miles on it.
   The paint job has lasted almost completely, which just one place where the clear coat is peeling, and absolutely NO rust. The interior (seats, dash, and carpet) still looks brand new, but I have always taken good care of it. The original hubcaps were very shabby, but I replaced them with inexpensive ones from the Auto shop, and it looks very snazzy.
   I have never had to do any serious work on this car. It has not needed a new clutch, or any sort of overhaul. The only work I have done is belt replacement, tune ups, new brake pads, and oil changes. 
   Another great thing about this car is its ability to haul stuff. I always called it &quot;my little truck.&quot; The back seat lays down flat, and when you combine that with the space in the hatchback you have much room to transport things. I have moved a TV, an entertainment center, and much more with this car. I have also taken it skiing with no problem (not many coupes fit skis!).
   My only complaints are no intermittent wipers or cruise control, but those are features, not cons. Also, you can pretty much forget about back seat passengers. They will hit their head on the back window unless they are 4 feet tall or less.
   It still runs great, looks great, and continues to be my primary car. I would recommend this vehicle highly.  The great gas mileage, reliability, and sporty good looks make it ideal for someone looking for a quality commuting car or a car for their teenager. <br><br>
