            I have to say - I love this car!  After driving a Protege while my car was in the shop several years ago, I was sold on the Protege.  Once I began shopping around for a new car, of course I bought a Protege!

The Protege has LOTS of room in the front and back seats that makes long road trips very bearable.  This was very important to me because I wanted my husband to be comfortable riding as well as driving on road trips (and he is 6'2&quot;).  My Protege gets GREAT gas mileage (approximately 30 mpg in town and 35 to 40 mpg on the road).  The warranty is another big plus on this car.  My car came with a 3 year / 50,000 mile warranty, which means we can go on those long distance road trips and still not run out of warranty!  The Protege had more leg room on the front passenger side than all of the other cars we test drove that were approximately the same size (Cavalier, Neon, Escort, etc).

I have had no problems with my Protege and have only had my car in the shop once (and that was my own stupidity!!!).  I let the gas tank get too low and it set off the malfunction indicator light!  I won't let that happen again.  I felt like an idiot!!!

I love my Protege and my next car will be a Mazda!<br><br>
