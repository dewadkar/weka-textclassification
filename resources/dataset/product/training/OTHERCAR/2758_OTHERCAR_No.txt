            I bought a my white Jetta Trek in 1997.  It has automatic transmission, and from the moment I drove it off the lot it seemed to have trouble shifting and tended to rev a lot.  I have brought it to the dealer four times for this same problem and each time they claim to not see the problem that I see.  However, I have had passengers in my car comment on the shifting.

In the first few months I had the car the fan on the heater broke, but was replaced and under warranty.  I drove the car for my job and drove over 24,000 miles in the first year, which ended the warranty, so if you're going to drive this car a lot, I would be prepared to spend a lot on maintenence.

The tape deck broke 10 miles before my warranty was up, and I really had to argue with the dealer to get it replaced, which they did end up doing.

Last year the car died in my driveway, had to be towed to the dealer, and the problem was determined to be malfuntioning spark plug of some sort.  Not a week later the car was dead again and this time it was determined that the whole fuel pump was ruined.

Since then my distributor has broken, which I am told never happens on these cars.  Each time I bring it to my dealer I end up spending $500 or more.  Of course my engine train has never had a problem because it is under warranty for 10 years/10,000 miles.  Kias are looking better to me every day!

The final straw is all the little things that have gone wrong.  The drivers seat started to wear (I didn't do anything to it, I swear!) and now there is a whole that is slowly getting bigger and bigger.  I opened the back door once to a pop, and the metal piece that holds the door open broke off.  The round knob that adjusts the drivers seat back has broken off twice.  I've given up getting that repaired.

Now with all that said, I can't in good conscience recommend this particular car to anyone.  But I will say with all the negatives and hassles I have had to endure, I still love the car itself.

It has been shifting much better as of late, and the ride itself is very comfortable.  It only has the four cylinder engine, but still has a lot of power to it.  The trunk space is fantastic, and people say they are comfortable riding in the back.

The Trek bike came with the car, and I use it and like it, but the roof rack is fairly useless to me, as I am only 5'1'' and can't get the bike up that high, so when I take it places I throw it in the trunk.  Such a waste of a roof rack!

Volkswagon would really have to do a lot of explaining and give me a great deal to give the Jetta another chance.
