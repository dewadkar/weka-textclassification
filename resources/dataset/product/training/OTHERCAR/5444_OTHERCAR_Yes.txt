            I purchased a GLS model of the Elantra. We were shopping for a truck for my hubby and I came home with a new car. Mine is Midnight Gray in color. It is kind of a purle/gray color. My hubby calles it the Barney mobile.

The car has power. Handles awesome on the road. Highway driving is smooth sailing. The warranty has me looking to take a road trip.

The standard features of the car are phenomenal. I have a automatic. It is equipped with power windows and locks, remote keyless entry,a/c,am/fm cassette player and mine also has cruise control. 

It has been a very hot sumer here in the northeast and the a/c is a wonderful treat. I am loving all the power toys. Hyundai is also designed to be driver friendly. All my controls,cup holders, ashtray etc are easily in my reach. I feel like I am in a old camaro.

My co workers were like wow what kind of car is that. One was like the front of it is stylish like a mercedes. It feels good to get compliments on a car that cost less than 13 thousand.

The gas mileage is great. 25 city and 33 highway. I use my car for work and rack up the miles. I had a 97 Elantra and this one is top rated. It is bigger and better designed than my old one. The safety features are top of the line.

The warranty is the best in the business.10 year 100,000 mile powertrain warranty. 5 year 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. Also has a 5 year unlimited mileage roadside assistance plan. 

If you want a great car for a great price purchase a Hyundai.
