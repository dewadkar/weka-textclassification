            Who knew that you could have a sexy, sporty car, that is economical as well?  I was surprised to find this car.  It allows me to have my cake and eat it too!
It's a very good looking sporty car.  The interior is a nice design, although the ergonomics could be a lot better.  The seats are on the firm side, but relatively comfy.  The seat-backs on the front seats are just too straight and stiff, so the back support does not feel to be a proper shape.  I was also suprised to see that the back seat can actually hold 2 adults!  That has to be a first in the sporty segment of autos!
I find the power from the standard engine to be adequate for everyday driving with the manual transmission.  It's a small engine, so it struggles on hills if it's not revving at least 3,000 RPM's.  It's a relatively good sounding, smooth engine though, which makes the revs more pleasant.
The ride of the car is definitely on the stiff side.  It can be a bit jittery at times if the roads are a bit rough.  But what should I expect?  It's a sporty car!
There is ample head and leg room front and back for everyone. 
I like the stereo.  It has good sound, is easy to use, but is mounted too low on the dash.  Why do manufacturers love doing this?  Mount it at the top!
Another thing I love about this car is the big trunk with split-folding seats.  You can fit so much in there for a sporty car!
The gas mileage is also something to like about this car.  22MPG in the city and 31 on the hightway...woohoo!  I average 30mpg.  My old Volvo got 25MPG on the highway and that really stinks.
Reliability is questionable.  This car is part Mitsubishi, part Chrysler.  The chasis, interior, and other major components are not Chrysler.  The only thing Chrysler did with this car was style the exterior and put a motor in it.  When I bought my Avenger, the power steering and A/C were not working because the power steering rack had a major leak, and the engine was "shuddering" badly under acceleration and the "check engine" light was on, but all it needed was a tune-up to fix the problem.  Considering that the car has 126,000 miles, I suppose that isn't too bad.  Overall, I'm happy with the car for the $1,648 I paid for it.  Sporty, fun, AND economical!

*UPDATE*

     I've only put about 2,000 miles on the car and I'm starting to hate the reliability!  The front wheels make a constant chirp, chirp, chirping noise that drives me nuts!  The rotors are obviously warped because the brakes pulsate heavily.  Now, the "check battery" light illuminates and stays on the entire time I'm driving.  I had this checked out and the mechanic said there is no problem.  About every other time I go out to start the car, it takes a good 4 or 5 times before it cranks.  The driver's window kept going off track so I had it repaired and now the window won't roll completely up, so I get dripped on when it rains...lovely!  Repair costs are totally outrageous for an American car!  $250 to get a replacement headlight!?  I do not trust or feel safe in this car crappy car!
