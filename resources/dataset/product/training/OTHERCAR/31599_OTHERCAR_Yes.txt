            I have had the urge to buy a digital camera after having the opportunity to use a Kodak DC240 at my office.  The ability to take a photo and delete it immediately if you don't like it is a great convenience and for a 3x5 or 4x6 photo the 1.3 million pixels of the DC240 is fine.  

However, I wanted a camera that would not only take excellent photos but that could be blown up to 8x10 without perceived loss of image quality. From my research I decided that I would need at least a 2-million pixel camera.  I was considering the Kodak DC 290 for about $900 or the Nikon Coolpix 950 but then Nikon came out with the Coolpix 800 which had the same pixel count as the 950 but with fewer features and several hundred dollars less.  

I decided on a Nikon primarily because of their reputation for optical quality and ruggedness of construction.   I haven't been disappointed.  The Coolpix 800 takes strikingly sharp pictures and incorporates 3 light metering modes for optimum light balance.  The 2x optical zoom works very well and the ability to add additional telephoto, wide angle and fish-eye lenses makes for even a greater working range.

The camera is exceptionally compact and light in weight and absolutely easy to use.  Within an hour I had taken 20 shots and, using the cord supplied, downloaded 10 that I liked onto my computer's hard-drive.  Twenty minutes later I had attached 5 pics to an email and sent them out to friends on the East coast and in Europe...just amazing.  

The camera has both an LED display on the back and a separate view-finder.  The LED shows the actual photo being framed but the view finder has different outlines for wide-angle and telephoto shots.  The LED is bright and easy to use but I found that it can be difficult to see when there is bright sunlight on it as is often the case outdoors on a bright day.  In that case the viewfinder works just fine but there is some guess work required as to what you have framed if you are at some intermediate position of the zoom.

Depending on how long you keep the LED screen on I think you can get about 40-50 shots on a set of four AA alkaline batteries.  I would like to see the batteries last longer but this is a common problem with many digital cameras.  As I use it more I plan to get several sets of latest  technology rechargeable batteries.   I will also get a floppy disc adapter to hold the flash memory card for faster downloading onto the computer.

All in all I am extremely happy with the photo quality, the camera  packaging and the ease of use.  To me, the bottom line is picture quality and this camera definitely produces!  Unlike others I haven't had to use Nikon customer support so I can't comment on that aspect of ownership.                     <br><br>
