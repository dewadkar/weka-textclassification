            The 1998 Toyota Camry has enough of everything to satisfy just about any type of buyer. The car glides along the road like a much more expensive luxury car. The V6 engine has enough power for those who like to break the speed limit once in a while. It has an attractive, sleek look that is half sports car, half luxury car. Toyota has found a way to make a four-door sedan look good. It is a car that is functional enough for a family of four, but impressive enough to drive to the golf course on Saturday.

The only drawback seems to be a slight blind spot when looking over the left shoulder. Also, we find the daytime headlights a bit silly and annoying. The V6 engine is a must. The 4 cylinder is weak, and the fuel economy is not much better than the 6. We did extensive research before purchasing the car, and it is without question the best car in its class, with all due respect to the Volkswagen which is also a good car.
