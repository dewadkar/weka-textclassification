            I've wanted a Saturn since they first came out.  Finally, I decided to buy one when my S-10 got up to 110,000 miles.  This time, I was able to buy the top trim level, and not settle for the basic model.  The only options I added were alloy wheels and a CD/cassette sound system.
Overall, I'm very happy with the car.  It was well worth the wait.  I'm especially impressed with its acceleration.  I kept the standard 5-speed transmission because I'm partial to manuals, and the automatic seemed lethargic anyway.  All my other new cars had four cylinders, but this Saturn will run circles around all of them.  It's so fast I have to force myself to slow down.  Fortunately, I've only received one speeding ticket, so far.
Now, for the down side.  I'm a little disappointed about a few things:
     1. The &quot;up shift indicator light&quot; in the instrument panel.  Very annoying.  It's the first thing I did-disable it.  Besides, it's not needed with a standard tachometer.
     2. The center armrest/console cover is too high.  I would hit my elbow on it when shifting into 2nd and 4th, and had to remove it and put a small pillow in it's place.
     3. The forwardmost cupholder interferes with the ventilation controls, and my hand hits the cup when shifting into 1st, 3rd, and 5th.  I just can't get a break with this shifting business!
     4. Large cups have to be put in the rear cupholder (just behind the shifter), but they interfere with the parking brake and my elbow, again, when shifting.
     5. Anti-lock brakes are not standard, but should be in a car at this              trim level.  They're bundled in with traction control for $1500.  No thanks!
     6. No glove compartment light. (?)
     7. No courtesy lights (floorboard).  Again, they should be standard at this trim level.
     8. No underhood light.  It would be nice to have it.  There's one in the trunk!<br><br>
