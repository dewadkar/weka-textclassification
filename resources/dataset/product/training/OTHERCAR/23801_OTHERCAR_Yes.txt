            I was looking for a cheap and dependable new car. From what I had heard, I was afraid of the Korean and American made cars that are produced in this price range. Toyota was noted for its dependability--- and the fact that the Echo has a timing chain, and not a timing belt like other cars in this market implied quite a lot about its prospects for being mechanically dependable. I purchased my Echo at the end of February and have been driving it around town but have not had a chance to test it on a long road trip as of yet. I like the interior space, with its up right seating. Driving it reminds me somewhat of the old VW Beetle of my youth back in the early 1970s--- though unlike that old Beetle, this car has a lot more pick up off a stop and a lot more power at the top---- the only times I've been in 5th gear are on the Interstate highway where it flys pretty good. I've had it over 80 with ease and obviously it had more to go. Indeed, the pick up in low gear is such that it is very easy to squeal the tires when making a sharp fast turn either left or right from a dead stop--- something that I was not trying to do. The little engine seems to pack an awful lot of power for its size, and with the five speed gearing, it makes five on the floor fun to use. The car I purchased is very basic. Two doors with standard transmission, but with power steering and an air conditioner. A standard AM/FM radio without a tape or CD player sounds fine to me. The air conditioner feels plenty cold and the heater feels plenty warm. The trunk is surprisingly large due to its noticeable height. So far, it seems to be just what it was designed to be---- an ideal commuter car that is stingy on gas, easy to fit through tight places, and comfortable enough to spend some extended time driving in traffic every day. The price I paid was excellent, I thought. With a rolling death trap trade in, I got this spiffy little car for $10,000. 

I've found this distinctive little car to be a real head turner. It has some of the new VW retro bug quality without the high price or the extreme retro look. Rather, it is a sort of a cheery looking little jelly bean that stands taller in the parking lot than anything other than the vans and RVs. However, this car's unique styling seems to appeal much more to women than it does to men. Many women have actually come up to me asking about this car, but not a single man. I can only suspect that the reason is Freudian. This car is very short on hood. When seated in the diver's seat, I can't even see the hood--- just a clear view of the road out the front windshield. Women don't seem to mind this short hood, but men often seem to suffer from hood envy, and desire a much larger hood and a more rip roaring engine. As I noted, women actually seem to find this car  &quot;cute&quot;, but a lot of men feel threatened by its rounded almost breast shaped design. Gas mileage appears to be great, but I haven't measured it. But, with gas prices as they are, I feel better and better about buying this fuel conserving little car. I expect to get 40 mpg on my road trip.

So far, this car has been just great. I will know more, however, after I do a few long road trips and maybe another six more months of driving on this car to see if any glitches eventually develop. Up until now though, I've had no problems and some good fun on the road. A fine car, for one or two people, but probably not the best if you have a back seat to fill with adults or with kids.   <br><br>
