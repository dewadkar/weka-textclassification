            My '96 Dodge Ram 2500, purchased used but still under warranty, has had only one major problem--a transfer case that failed at 46,000 miles, just 10,000 miles past warranty coverage.  That's a $2,700 repair, but a call to Dodge customer service found them willing to cover all but $500 of the repair job.  The only other problem has been a rear wiring harness replacement at $150.

The extra width makes for super comfort even with three folks in front.  The ride is smooth and quiet.  Gas consumption runs at just over 10 mpg, overall--not great moneywise, but the extra large gas tank makes for fewer gas stops.

Parallel parking is surprisingly easy in even tight spaces.

My Ram gets a good workout in 4-wheel drive, as our mountain retreat, visit about twice a month, is atop the second highest mountain in West Virginia; 2-1/2 miles up a dirt and gravel road--steep and heavy with snowdrifts throughout the winter.  It gets a fair amount of off-road use, too.

The oil pressure and temperature have been dead center on the gauges for the Ram's entire 60,000+ miles, and performance has been consistently good.

My only problem isn't really a complaint.  The bed is, of course, high.  After all, it's a TRUCK.  And I'm getting to be an old man.  So it's tough loading and climbing in and out, and the 2500 is a powerful-deep bed, if you have to climb to the front of the bed.
