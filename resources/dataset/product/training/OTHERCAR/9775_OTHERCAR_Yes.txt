            Purchased this vehicle in Oct.' 98 as I was renovating an old house.  The plusses are a very quick SUV, especially with a 5-speed, and a sexy (for a SUV) body.  Also, the vehicle handles well and is quiet. Also, perfect size as more nimble than competitors without sacrificing any room. It's between an Explorer and a Rav 4. Negatives are dismal fuel economy and front seats without proper bolstering on the bottom.  This vehicle is seriously not for long hauls as it fatigues your legs. All in all a good value that could be a real winner if only Isuzu would do some tweaking and listen to customers.  It's a vehicle that stresses the &quot;sport&quot; in SUV and is very functional.  Though roomy, it's not comfortable as a long distance (over 100 miles) hauler.  Also, the radio sounds like a $50 Kraco!  Only 4 4&quot; speakers! 
If Isuzu would change the front seats and upgrade the stereo it would be almost perfect except for the fuel economy.  Any SUV does poorly in fuel consumption, but this is the bottom of the pack for this size of SUV.
