            A true driving experience! One of the musts for a true car lover is to enjoy the wonderful miracle that is a Porsche! The only everyday supercar in the world, with the exception of the NSX, but even Honda cannot equal the germans efforts in car perfection.

My latest drive, my friends brand new 2000 arrest-me-red Porsche 996 Carrera. Many will say that there is no such thing as a true porsche anymore, since they are now water-cooled, but the experience remains my friends!

My friends carrera was unfortunately equipped with the new tiptronic tranny instead of a traditional manual...or was it better, i think i was too excited to use a clutch to it potential, hehe ;). But, after driving, i would give very high marks to the tiptronic. Unlike other manufacturers attempts at a manual-automatic setup, the porsche will not shift until you want it to, even if your a bonehead who likes to hit the limiter. Downshifts are quick, upshifts just as quick. 

The car is incredibly solid. Nothing was lacking in either the chassis or suspension. How to make any other car feel like mush? Spend some time in a carrera. Acceleration is great, especially at highway speeds. On the express-way, cruising at 75, my friend tells me to go already. I go to 3/4 throttle and the speedo zooms up into triple digits, the digital read out skipping numbers because even it cant keep up with the porsche. In what seems like no time at all, we are cruising at 120-125. And road noise and the ride feel like just like when we were doing 15 through his neighbor hood.

The brakes too are just as amazing. The fine tuned braking system will bring you back down just as quickly as your right foot took you up. The suspension keeping the car nearly perfectly flat the whole time

Then of course theres the attention, possibly one of the best parts of owning a Porsche (next to the awe-inspiring performance of course ;)). Get ready for plenty of looks, and lots of leering eyes if your only 19 (gotta love it! im 19 and already have driven several of my (and yours;) )dream cars thanks to good friends!).

A great car, completely deserving of all its praise and recognition!<br><br>
