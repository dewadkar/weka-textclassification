            I bought my Malibu in December of 1998 and I have had very few problems with it. The peppy V-6 engine is powerful enough for those quick passes in traffic, yet economical enough not to damage the old pocketbook.

The few problems that I have experienced seem to revolve around the electrical system. My right rear light assembly retained water more than my wife while she was pregnant. I noticed the condensation building up not too long after I brought the car home. However, I took it to the dealership and they took care of it. The second electrical problem was with the horn. It worked part-time, but never when I needed it. This was also taken care of by the dealership.

The only non-electrical problem that I had was with the carpeting on the driver's side in front of the seat. The carpet has worn very badly there and I am not sure why.

Overall, I have been very pleased with the fuel economy, ride, and comfort of the Malibu and I would recommend it.
