            I just got myself to buy a car. I don't have the total freedom to any car I think it "cute" so I was surprised when I test-drove this one! The price was kind of high at first @ $16,010, but I wanted the "Sports Package" with the sun-roof... The dealership I bought from was giving a $2500 rebate on 2001 Cavaliers. (GREAT deal!) When I went to test drive, there was only one left and of course, it came with everything I wanted-except a V-6 engine. This car only has a V-2. It was pretty slow, and I figured my daughter would want a sporty car that went fast. But, I couldn't help the rebate, and I fell in love with the interior as well as the exterior. I bought it. The first time my daughter was in it, she blasted the radio (AM/FM CD) and rolled down the roof.  She quickly fell in love as well. The only problem is, I drove to New York (from Ohio) last weekend, and my passengers complained of discomfort after a few short hours. So, I'm sticking to using this "cool" car for small trips, and maybe to go to amusements park. I know my daughter will love it when she can drive it, and I am satisfied with the safety features. It is an automatic (and a Coupe), so I don't have to teach my daughter how to shift just yet. Another neat thing, the radio stays on even after the keys have been taken from the ignition-until the driver side door is opened. I like that as well, because my daughter complains when her favorite song comes on, and we're in the driveway. I just open my door, give her the key back. She starts the car, turns it off, and hands me the key through her door. She can relax for a moment listening to her song... I don't have power windows, which is okay in a Coupe. The trunk space is really nice too! And, if my daughter and I decide to go on a bike-ride, we can put the back seat down, and throw the bikes in (the back seat folds down to allow even more room from the trunk).
