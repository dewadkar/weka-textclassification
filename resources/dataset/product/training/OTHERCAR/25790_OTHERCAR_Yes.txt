            It was the horn on this car that first caught my attention.  (Yes, yes, I know, being a &quot;horn man&quot; leaves me in something of a minority; but we all have our little quirks.)  One listen to that sexy honker, and I just had to learn more about her.

Oh, sure, eventually I noticed her gorgeous butt, too -- I'm not entirely unconventional -- but on the way from the nose to the tail, I found much in between to admire.  Solid craftsmanship throughout, and a feel on the road of a much heavier vehicle.  Quiet in which I could meditate upon the mysteries of quibble architecture whilst driving.  Power that surprised me into a speeding ticket.

And just plain quality and character.  A nice honker is one thing -- it gets your blood rushing for that initial flush of enticement -- but it's the overall quality and enduring character of a car that makes you want to build a lasting relationship... something I can definitely see in the cards for me and the 626.  We're just made for each other.

Alas, though, there is a problem, here.  I tend to, uh, shall we say, drive both ways?  And I have my 1985 Mazda pickup, tooling along fit as the day we met, so dear to my heart and still unrusted... how could I ever give up a vehicle so entrenched in my most tender affections?

Maybe there is a way... the glimmer of possibility presents itself to me...

Mazda's are generous, intelligent vehicles.  Just perhaps, maybe in time, the two can learn to share me.
