            Everyone with a few kids thinks a mini van would be great.  My wife and I thought so too until we got one.  

My 1994 Caravan has been dependable transportation, but nothing more.  I liked my old Chevy Celebrity Station Wagon more.  

The Caravan has ample room in the front seats.  There is plenty of head room.  The middle bench seat has good leg room for elementary/middle school age kids but an adult wouldn't want to sit there for very long.  Please note, the middle bench seat has only shoulder seat belts.  My kids (ages 5 and 9) find this very uncomfortable and usually fight over who will get to sit in the back row seat where there is one lap belt.  This often results in the kids fighting over who gets to sit in the middle of the far back seat.  This back row bench seat has very little leg room and if you need to put luggage in this van (behind the seat), there is no leg room as you must move this seat forward.  Our family's best bet for traveling with kids and anything more than one suitcase is to take out the middle bench seat and build a wall of luggage between the adults and kid who get to sit in the far back seat and fight over the one lap belt.  

The cargo space in the van is only good if you don't want to take passengers.  The seats can be awkward and a little difficult to remove.

The air conditioning on this vehicle has been a problem.  First, it keeps breaking.  Second, it uses the new coolant, not freon.  This new coolant is expensive and doesn't seem to cool the van very well when the AC chooses to work. Driving with the windows open does not necessarily cool the van.  It does cause lots of wind noise to the point that you can't hear the radio.  The window latches on the pop out rear windows don't always keep the windows open.  

Don't get me wrong, the Caravan has been a dependable vehicle if you overlook the lack of leg room, poor AC, wind noise, and kids fighting over the one lap belt.  As mentioned earlier, I prefer my old 200,000 mile 1985 Chevy Celebrity Station Wagon.  <br><br>
