            My husband and I purchased our Montana after searching for a long time for just the &quot;right&quot; vehicle to meet the needs of our large family. The indoor space of the montana and the sleek style of the outside were strong selling points for us. However after having our Montana for 6 months now I do have some complaints about the overall &quot;quality&quot; of the vehicle. 
    After paying around 30,000 dollars I expected it to be sturdy enough to handle my children. The firs t item to go was the ashtray. My son who is 16 entered the vehicle on the passenger side and barely nudged it with his knee. Yes, you guessed it, cheap plastic and it is broken and now just hangs there. 
     The plastic covers that encase the holders for the removable seats are truly cheap. After removing the seats a few times these have become broken as well.
      An added note to the cheap plastic parts that this van is made of....the seatbelt adjuster will NOT stay in the upward position. This makes riding in the vehicle very uncomfortable because the seatbelt constantly chokes you. <br><br>
