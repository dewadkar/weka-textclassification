            The 1997 Chevy, Monte Carlo is one of those automobile that falls into the &quot;everybody has one&quot; category.  This is true, you see them everywhere, but I am sure there are some people driving them around, just as I am that are somewhat disappointed.  
For the price, the car is everything it should be, (power windows, A/C, power locks, tilt, cruise, and keyless entry are all standard).  However, the actual integrity of the car lacks something to be desired.  My Monte Carlo currently has 44,000 miles and is already giving me some problems that I would not expect to see until the car is a little older.  The Oil Temp. back lighting is not working, the drivers side power lock doesn't work anymore, cruise only works when it feels the need (which isn't that often).  My gas mileage has also decreased over the last 5000 miles of the cars life.
To shorten up the car is very well thought out, but just not too well built, if you choose to buy this car, be prepared to encounter some minor problems.
