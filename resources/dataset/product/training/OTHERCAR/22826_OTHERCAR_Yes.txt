            We have done the &quot;minivan thing&quot; for a few years to haul the family (myself, my wife, and two young sons) around town and for vacations.  During the process, we've owned a couple vans and have driven several others.  The '97 Town and Country is definitely a &quot;best of class&quot;, very functional van.

LIKES:

The �look�.  Let�s face it, looks are important and this van is very classy.  When you think �minivan�, you instantly think of the look of the Caravan.  Since the Town and Country is just a top of the line Caravan, the looks are inherent.  Chrysler, in my opinion, has defined the standard and the standard is very pleasing.  I like the sleek nose and consistent shape of the �97.  The new Town and Country�s still follow this same design.

The power.  We�ve got the 3.8 liter V-6 and it�s got plenty of power.  It gets up to speed quickly on the highway and has enough get up and go to pass effectively.

The options.  We�ve got the LXi model and it�s loaded.  I love the overhead digital console that keeps you informed of the mileage, etc.  The dual air/heat and rear air/heat really serve their purpose.  Another nice option is the fact that the factory stereo comes with both a CD player and a cassette player (for those of us that still have cassettes).  We have the Infinniti sound system and it is nice.  The bass vibrates a little too much when cranked up, but the overall sound is good for a sound system that came with the vehicle.  There are dozens of other useful options � too many to describe in great detail.  Drive one of these vehicles for yourself and take a look at all of the options.

The gas tank.  It holds a full 20 gallons, which makes trips to the gas station less frequent.

DISLIKES:

The gas mileage.  I guess I shouldn�t complain too much.  We typically get about 22+ miles per the gallon combining city and highway driving.  Not too bad for a larger 6 cylinder engine, but with today�s gas prices, it would be nice to get a couple more miles to the gallon.

The power window controls.  All of the driver-side power window controls are nested together at the end of the arm rest, with the power lock thrown in the mix, I sometimes find myself hunting for the proper control.  Could just be me, but I�d like these controls a little easier to navigate.

SUMMARY:

Nice, solid, good looking van that hasn't given us any problems so far.<br><br>
