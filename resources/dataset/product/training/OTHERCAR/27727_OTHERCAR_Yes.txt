            The Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a nice digital snapshot camera. Photographers looking for more bang for their buck, though, may be disappointed by the meager feature set.
  First, the basics. The Digital Elph measures just 3.4-by-2.2-by-1.1 inches and weighs 6.7 ounces (without CF card or battery). That�s virtually identical to the original Canon Elph, which was 3.6-by-2.4-by-1.1 inches and weighed 6.3 ounces (without battery). The digital version also other similarities to its predecessor, like the side-mounted strap holder. This placement encourages the use of the Elph as a fashion accessory, not just a picture-taking device.
  For such a small camera, the LCD and the viewfinder are surprisingly generous. The LCD is a 1.5-inch TFT LCD that�s easy to see, even in sunlight. The optical viewfinder has a nice round shape and bright image. The placement is a logical: A little left of center, as opposed to the dead-center placement of most cameras.
  The Digital Elph is pretty much �auto-everything.� Exposure and focus are all handled automatically, although shooting is a little slow. Overall, I found the camera to be a little sluggish. Pressing the �on� button doesn�t necessarily mean the Elph springs to life. I missed a few shots on my first day using it, waiting for the camera to turn on.
  The camera is pretty easy to use, primarily because the picture-taking options are so limited. There�s one metering method (center), one focus method (three-point AF) and one exposure method (TTL program). There�s also only one file format, JPEG, which means shutterbugs who like to wrestle with uncompressed TIFFs for maximum quality will be disappointed.
  Like the original Elph, the camera�s flash is very close to the lens, which increases the chance for red-eye. The user does have choice of several flash modes � auto, on, off, red-eye reduction and slow synchro � so if you  think about it, you can probably overcome the red-eye issue.
  The Canon S100 uses a non-standard lithium ion battery, which measures 1.3-by-1.9-by-0.4 inches, so you can forget about popping in a pair of AAs in a pinch.
  The lens is a pretty capable f/2.8 5.4 � f/4 10.8mm. That�s equivalent to 35-70mm in 35mm film format, which is pretty much standard. You won�t be able to capture sports or action shots but it�s pretty sharp. 
  PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is supplied with these accessories: lithium battery pack NB-1L, battery charger CB-2L, an 8MB CompactFlash card, USB interface cable, video cable, wrist strap, PowerShot Solutions Software CD-ROM, and Adobe PhotoDeluxe CD-ROM.
 Optional accessories include AC adapter kit ACK300 (which contains compact power adapter CA-PS300, DC coupler DR-300, and an AC Power Cord) and soft compact case PSC 100 (with space for and extra battery and CF card) as well as spare batteries, CF cards and interface cables.
