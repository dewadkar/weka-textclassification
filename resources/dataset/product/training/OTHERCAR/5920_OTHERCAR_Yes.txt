<TEXT>
            I currently own a 1996 Isuzu Rodeo 4x4 w/auto.After owning a # of jeep Cherokees, I thought why not try something totally different....A Rodeo is just that!!
  I Don't most generally keep a vehicle more than a few years,but this one has sparked my interest..I've heard so much about a rough ride..Hum..Rides light-years better than my 96 Cherokee..The engine,I LOVE and Hate, Love the 
power,smoothness,sound..Hate the missing torque,high RPM Howl (whenever one encounters a downshift hill)..Fuel economy is on par w/a Grand Cherokee equipped w/a 4.0 6 cyl. But one does have an edge as far as power goes.I know,my son has a 99 Grand..We've done a lot of comparisons. Jeep
has the edge when it comes to the TRANSFER CASE! You just can't beat that
Full time/Part time Select trac edge.God,I hate part time..I'm not saying 
I love FULL TIME either,but the ability to chose,that's important.I prefer
the drive and ride in my rodeo,the 16&quot; wheels might have a bearing on this
but I'm not sure,Ive never driven one w/15&quot;<br><br>
