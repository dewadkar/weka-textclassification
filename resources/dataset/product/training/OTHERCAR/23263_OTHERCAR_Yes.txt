            This is a big improvement from the 1999 model. I owned a 1999 Quest SE for two years. However, while driving the minivan you could hear noises coming from places that not even Nissan mechanics could detect where they were coming from. The standard features are excellent and the front design was changed giving it a nice look. The ride is very smooth and firm. Handles like a car specially in tight turns. Gas mileage did not improve. However, I drove this minivan from Miami to New York and spend $162.00 round trip on 09/15/2002. If you want to improve your gas mileage keep the tires at the proper air pressure at all times or you will waste a lot of gas among other things.

The size is perfect and the rear passengers have plenty of foot space. I looked at other minivans before buying another Quest but did not like their design. The majority are plain looking and the standard features are much less unless you are willing to pay more. 

One detail that disappointed me was the fact that Nissan removed the TV tuner from this model and left it as a video monitor to play VHS tapes and video games for children. My old 99 Quest had a TV tuner and it was nice to hear the 5 o' clock  news during rush hour traffic or watch my favorite TV show while waiting on someone. Another feature I do not like is that they replaced the sunglasses holder for a small conversation mirror, which for my taste is a waste of space. I liked the idea of storing my sunglasses there, they were always easy to find.

The sunroof package is another nice feature I did not have on my 99 Quest. which by the way is not standard. I enjoy it because I can get some fresh air without opening the windows, specially in high crime areas. In addition, during heavy traffic at least you can look at the sky and will not feel claustrophobic. However, it is hard for some reason to determine when the sunroof is actually closed because the switch operates in two directions, one to slide open the sunroof the other to raise it. The closing point is in the middle which could possibly expose the vehicle to water damage if it is not done right. 

My 99 Quest in two years gave me very little problems aside from regular maintenance and the strange noises that seem to be fixed on the 2001 Quest. I enjoyed its comfort so it was hard to give it up. It is easy to park specially in an overcrowded city like Miami Florida.  A salesman was recommending a Ford Expedition which I find too big and I imagine would take me to the poor house with the high gas prices.

Other nice features are the built in  digital compass on the rear view mirror and a digital display in the control panel which lets you know how many miles you can drive before running the gas tank on empty. This is great for long trips. I wish it had the On Track system. In addition, you can open the last side windows with a switch located at the driver's door, this helps tremendously to cool off the vehicle after it has been parked all day under the south Florida sun.  

I heard news that Nissan will stop the production of the Quest in 2002 which I think is a major mistake. Others say that they will resume production in 2005 hopefully that will be the case.I have a lot of confidence in Nissan vehicles, I owned a Nissan 240SX for ten years with no major mechanical breakdowns. I recommend this vehicle very much to everybody. You will not be disappointed. UPDATE!!!!!!! I have driven this vehicle for a full year with no need to take it to the dealer for any repairs. only for regular scheduled maintenance. Way to go NISSAN.
