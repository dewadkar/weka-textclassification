              The Dodge Caravan is a great car.  The Caravan can seat up to 8 people, and be seated comfortably.  The caravan has two sliding doors so you can get in or out of easier then the older versions of the Caravan and other brands that only have one sliding door.  The Dodge Caravan has room for about anything you can think of.  
  The Dodge Caravan has a sporty look to it, so you do not have to be embarased to be driving a mini van.  The Caravan is a very reliable car and is pretty good in the snow.  

ALL in All it's a great car.<br><br>
