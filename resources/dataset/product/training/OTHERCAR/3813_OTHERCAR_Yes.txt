            I previously owned a 1997 Honda CRV, the first USA model to come out. We were looking for a new car and wanted an SUV, so when the new CRV was announced we were very excited. The older model was a great car, with limitations in road noise, features and power. All of these have been addressed. The 2002 firstly looks cool, really cool. We have the red model, it is a deep dark red. We also test drove a Hyundi Santa Fe and a Toyota Rav4. There was just no contest. 
The inside feels very comfortable, there are multiple spaces for putting things and storage bins. The radio is placed high on the dash so you dont have to look too far down from the path of the road to change things. There is a front loading 6 CD changer, tape player , AM/FM radio. The sound is excellent and the controls easy to use. 
The hand break has been moved into the dash board and off the floor to creat more space on the floor. It fits in very well with the design. 
The acceleration is noticably improved, you can find yourself speeding if you dont pay attention, and unlike the 1997 CRV with a full car (4 people, shopping and a dog) you still move fast. 
The passenger seats in the back can slide forward and back independently, there is an armrest with cup holders for the back, the seat belts fit into little pockets in the seat so you dont have loose them 'behiind' the seat. 
Oil change is needed at 10,000 miles, Hondas are very very reliable cars that have a wonderful resale value unlike many American cars. Ask anyone who has owned a Honda, they just keep running. 
Safety was a big concern of ours, the CRV has front AND side airbags (driver and passenger), and antilock breaks. This is standard on the EX model. 
The ignition key comes with a chip build in that acts as an immobilizer making it much more difficult to steal (hopefully). 
The back seat windows and rear windows have 'privacy glass' i.e. they are tinted making it difficult to see in to, there is no problem seeing out of them. 
There are just nice little touches all over the car that make it feel like a car that should cost much more. 
My family saw the car and were very impressed, they thought it would be in the upper 20'sK or low 30's. No, the dealer list price is 22740. As this was a new car I did not even try to haggle. There was a slight delay in getting the car as there was a defect on the seat belt. Unlike some car makers this was noticed by Honda immediately and corrected before the car was allowed to be distributed. The dealer just had to relpace a small part on the mechanism, it took less than a hour. 
Finally when leasing Honda now allows you to have up to $1500 of damage on the car when you return it (can be any number of scratches as long as they total cost to repair is less than $1500).
IF you can get one of these cars, you will be very very happy. Test drive the others, you will see what I mean. I will update this review if there are any problems.
