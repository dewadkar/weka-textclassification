            My husband and I were in the market for a four door, used vehicle after the birth of our first child. I will admit that buying a Nissan wasn't one of my first thoughts, but after the test drive I couldn't resist.
We bought our Nissan Altima in December of 1997, and have since put of 60,000 miles on it.
It has safely taken us from one duty station to another, to college classes, and various other spots, without a single major repair. We have had NO complaints. 
The vehicle even made it thru a rear ending from a government owned van with needing anything other than the body repaired.
We currently have just over 100,000 miles on it and fully expect it to last until the odometer reads 200,000.
The look is sporty, yet will accommodate the family quite well. It is great on gas, and is comfortable for the long drives - trust me I have driven from SC to TX in it and twice from TX to Iowa. It was the best choice for us, and I would love to have the newest Altima when we are ready for another car.<br><br>
