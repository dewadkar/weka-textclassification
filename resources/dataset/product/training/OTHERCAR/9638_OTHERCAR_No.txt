            I'm 32 years old and my wife is pregnant with our first child.  We needed an economical/practical/reliable &quot;second&quot; car.  The Neon seemed to have a lot going for it - styling, price and performance (and yes, if you didn't know by now, you can fit two full-grown adults comfortably in the back seat).  

We have had the car for 6 months and are trading it off this week (the sooner the better).

The head gasket was replaced, O2 sensor problems, paint is chipping excessively, windows don't roll up properly and the &quot;service engine soon&quot; light has been on twice since we had it (O2 sensor and &quot;multiple misfiring&quot; which required a change in spark plugs at 50K).  It seems every time we get in it there is a new noise coming from somewhere.  Some of these can't even be described but my wife and I have looked at each other with confused/concerned faces on more than one occasion.  A friend suggested that I call George Lucas - he may put a microphone in it and record sound effects for the next installment of the Star Wars saga.  

I did some research before buying the car.  I seem to recall &quot;Consumer Report&quot; gave it their &quot;best buy&quot; designation (?)  I wish I would have checked the 'net.  If you don't know it by now, there are &quot;chat sites&quot; which even discuss initiating mass torte litigation against Dodge over serious (and consistent) reliability issues.  Don't get on this bandwagon... cut your losses now and sell it.

There are positives.  The handling is very good in the corners and does get reasonable mileage (would like a larger tank though).  I know there are people out there satisfied with this product, however, I suspect these numbers are dwindling over time.  Have you noticed how many Neons (even 2000s) are on the used car lots?  This is (was) our first Dodge purchase.  It will likely be our last. 

When I picked it up from the dealership last week I asked the mechanic to give me his &quot;honest&quot; opinion on the car's reliability.  He said &quot;we see a lot of them, but there are a lot out there&quot;.  This is true, but I would prefer it if they were sitting in someone else's driveway.
