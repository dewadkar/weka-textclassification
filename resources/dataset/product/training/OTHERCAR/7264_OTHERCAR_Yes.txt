            My wife got the Minolta Dimage F100 as a gift from a promotion company.  At first we figured we were getting a basic digital camera.  Boy were we shocked when we opened the package.

<b>starting up and the basics</b>
everything is very well packaged What is nice is that everything you need to get started is right in the box.  No need to buy batteries or memory cards. Assembly of the battery and memory card took no time at all.  

The camera is only 5 inches wide, 3 inches tall and about an inch thick.  It weighs about half a pound.  Translation : you can take it anywhere!

With easy use one touch photography options, I was snapping pictures about 5 minutes after I opened the box.  The menu system is a breeze to go though and to use all basic functions (turning on the camera, taking a picture, deleting a picture, and so on) you do not even need the manual.

<b>a bit more advanced...</b>
The camera gives you options on both quality of the picture as well as pixel size.  The camera comes with a 16 MB memory card.  Using the most common settings this card will give you 29 high quality pictures at 1600x1200 resolution, or 45 pictures at a still good quality 1280x960.  Depending on what the pictures are for would depend on your choice of resolution.  If you are just going to put them on a website, you could select 640x480 and economy quality pictures to get 226 total shots, or if you are looking to print your pictures on photo paper you can go up to super fine resolution and an image size of 2272x1704 and get one tremendously perfect shot.

the one touch buttons in back give you a huge range of options.  You can select from 6 different lighting situations (poses, sports, sunset, etc.)  You can opt to turn off the 1 inch LCD display and use the optional "film camera like" view finder.  This saves you on your battery charge.  another button allows you to view the pictures you have taken and keep or delete them at your option.

<b>even more advanced!</b>
If you are more than a point and shoot type of person (unlike myself) you will also be happy to know there is a manual setting to this camera as well.  It allows you to change shutter speeds, f-stops, apatures, and other technical terms that I may learn about some day...  As far as I can tell there are more features than an average person will ever get to use...

<b>uploading</b>
OK, all of this is great, but if you can't get the pictures to the computer, then what is the point?  Well the Camera is USB compatable which means if you have a USB slot (a really thin slot on your computer) all you have to do is plug the camera into the computer and you are in business.  It runs on PCs that have Win 98 and higher as well as macs (though I'm not sure which OS you need as I have a PC.)  The uploading took less than five minutes, including the time it took to install the driver.

The camera comes with a viewing program which allows you to upload, edit, crop, retouch, and do other various things to your pictures.  

<b>more than a camera</b>
two features that totally shocked me when I saw it was on there.  First, the camera has a built in microphone (don't ask, i have no idea where they fit it.)  After you take a picture you can add an audio caption to it.  Nice little touch to add to a slide show.  

Second, there is a movie camera option on here too!  An empty memory card can record about 45 seconds worth of video and audio.  This too can be uploaded on to your computer with the above mentioned viewer.

<b>Downfalls</b>
OK, so what is the catch?  Well unless you are lucky like myself and get one for free, the price is really up there, close to $500 or more...

second is the battery.  The camera takes a lithium battery (which looks like two AA batteries taped together) that costs about $12.  The manual says that without the LCD screen on (which you can turn off from the back with a touch of a button) the battery can play for about 200 hours.  I'm guessing if you leave the screen on it may last 50 hours or so.  This doesn't include time to upload onto the computer.  I highly recommend either picking up rechargable NiMH batteries or the optional AC power adapter (which costs about $30).

this is a small price to pay for a camera of this quality however.  The picture resolution, the interface, the ease of use all make this a wonderfully fun and easy camera to use.
