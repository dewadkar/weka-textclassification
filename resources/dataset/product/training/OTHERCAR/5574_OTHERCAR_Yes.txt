            The Mercedes-Benz SL class is the epitome of the Mercedes Family and the car world in general.  This is by far the most beautiful car I have ever seen!!!  

Coming in four different engine sizes (SL280, SL320, SL500, SL600), the SL class has all the characteristics of a great sports car, beauty, control, and speed.  At $128,000, the top of the line SL600 has produces 390 horsepower in its V12 engine.  The car goes from 0-60 in under 5.5 seconds.  The beauty of this car, is that along with this acceleration is achieved in an extremely quiet, smooth, and fluid manner.  You feel like you are flying when driving this car.  Along with this speed, Mercedes-Benz also provides safety.  The braking and cornering are stunning.  The car has airbags in practically every crevice of the interior.  The optional convertible also comes with a roll bar to protect the passengers in case the car rolls.  When driving this car, you honestly feel like you are in a tank.

I bought a 98 SL600 because I was in the market for a high class sports car.  I had also test driven the Jaguar XK8 and the Porsche 911.  I decided upon the Benz because, although not the fastest, has the greatest reputation.  Mercedes-Benz's are known for their safety, precision engineering, low maintenance, and high resale value.  I love my car, and have had little problems with it over the years.

I would recommend the SL600, or any SL class for that matter, to anyone in the market for a high end sports car. <br><br>
