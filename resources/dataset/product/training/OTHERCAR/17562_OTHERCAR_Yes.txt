            In the past, I would not have considered a Saturn 4 cylinder engine, which are buzzy, noisy beasts. However, the ecotec 4 cylinder engine, mated to the five speed manual transmission, works very well. The engine is very smooth and quiet. The transmission is fun to shift, it feels teutonic, with very positive engagements. Considering the zero percent interest over five years, no other competing vehicle comes close in price. Honda, Toyota, and Ford do not have similar interest rate plans on competing models, although Mitsubishi does. Wheelbase and interior room about matches a Jeep Grand Cherokee, but gas mileage is much higher with the four cylinder. The suspension is firm, but not overly so. The VUE is very nimble withs its electric power steering. The body is very solid and tight. Workmanship inside and out is superb, much better than what GM has done in the past. For $19600, the vehicle came with sunroof, leather, power windows, power locks, heated front seats, electric rear window defogger, rear window wiper, upgraded six speaker stereo system, cruise control, lumbar adjustable drivers seat, aluminum wheels, and dealer installed window tinting and pinstriping. Zero down, no payments for three months. Last but not least, it really is easier working with Saturn dealers.
