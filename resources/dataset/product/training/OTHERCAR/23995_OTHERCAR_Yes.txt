            We just sold our trusty '92 Honda Accord LX and sometimes I wish we could have put it out to pasture instead.  What a great car!  Technically it was made in America, but wow what a car.  We were the second owners, and I thought it was a little silly when the first owner choked up a little as we drove off in her car, but now I understand.  The only maintenance we did was routine, and it wasn't expensive at all.  After a while the buttons and knobs started to go a little bit, around 80,000 miles, but that was it.  I appreciated the fact that Honda didn't change the styling much during the nineties so it always looked up to date, and I never worried about breakdowns or expensive maintenance.  Honda spoiled me.

I suppose that the downside for me was that we really just outgrew the car.  That's why we have an Odyssey now, likewise a solid dependable car.  The accord never rattled or shook, it was quiet and comfortable, and it was simply not working for us in terms of size anymore.  The new, third 
owner reports to me that everything is going well and she too loves the car.  So if you get a deal on a Honda LX, jump on it, you'll be pleased.<br><br>
