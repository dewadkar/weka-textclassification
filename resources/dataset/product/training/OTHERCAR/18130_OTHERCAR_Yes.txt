            One day, about 2 years ago, I was driving to work after taking my son to daycare.  I was happy and content with my means of transportation, having driven my Volvo 850 for over a year.  While at a stoplight, I glanced over at the attractive SUV next to me.  It looked somewhat familiar, but I knew this was something new to the road.  I purposely drove slow as the light changed so the SUV could pass me.  And thus my love affair with the <b>Toyota Highlander</b> began.

The Volvo fared me well for a little while longer, but I began having several small problems with the wagon.  Perhaps it was saddened by the fact that my affections had shifted elsewhere?  At first my ponderings were limited to reading reviews on epinions.  Alas, a new automobile was not in our budget.  But as time passed and the Volvo became a less satisfactory companion, I delved into learning all I could about my beloved.

As of the date of this review, the Highlander is available in 6 main categories:

1) 4-cyl. 4 x 2
2) 4-cyl. 4 x 4
3) 6-cyl. 4 x 2
4) 6 cyl. 4 x 4
5) 6-cyl. 4 x 2 Limited
6) 6 cyl. 4 x 4 Limited

For model year 2003, the 4 cylinder models have 155 hp, while the 6 cylinder models have 220 hp.  Standard features on the base models (1-4) include:  

~ Stereo/Cassette/CD w/ 6 speakers

In every published review I read, the Toyota Highlander was ranked in the top 3 of vehicles in this class.  More often than not, it was ranked #1.  In fact, the only negative press I have read about the Toyota Highlander is in regards to its body styling--apparently some auto reviewers think it's very plain and boring.  If it was <i>that</i> plain and boring, I don't think it would have turned my head in the first place.  Besides, the reliability and safety of a vehicle rank at the top of my list of important things.  

Early this year, our financial situation changed.  I could see the light at the end of the automobile tunnel, and its beacon spelled "Highlander".  It was especially good timing, because the Volvo had gotten to the point where it needed a lot of work to keep it from falling apart.  I dug deep into finding just the right Highlander to grace my carport.  

I searched the 'net to look at the used Highlander inventory of all nearby Toyota dealers.  That's when I discovered that a used Highlander wasn't that easy to find.  Sure, they're out there, but picky people are going to be disappointed with the selection.  Most of what I found was non-Limited models in White, Silver, and Gold.  I also began searching on some of the more popular online car marketplaces, as well as ebay.  I kept coming back to a certain dealership based on their awesome NEW car prices, and in the end purchased a new 2003 Highlander.  I got as good a deal on the new model (which, by the way, had all the features I wanted) as I had seen on many used models advertised.

My beauty is a <b>Bluestone Metallic, 4x4 Limited model</b> with the following add-on options:  perforated leather seats, sunroof, roof rack, and towing prep package.  I didn't really want or need a 4x4, but the price was too good to pass up.  I trembled as I drove off the lot, partially from excitement at finally having the car I've wanted for so long, but also because this was the first new car I've ever <i>owned</i> (I drove 6 new cars when I worked for an auto mfr., but those didn't count).

I'm not a car driving expert, and epinions is a consumer-oriented site, so I won't get into details most of us aren't concerned with.  Unlike other reviewers, I'm writing this from the point of view of an owner who has driven the care more than a few hours or days.  I can tell you that the handling is smooth and agile, and the response is quick and nimble.  In case you weren't aware, the Highlander is built on a Camry platform, so you get the same comfortable ride.  The pickup of the V6 is perfect for this-sized vehicle.  The gas mileage for my 4WD Limited is stated at 18 City/22 Hwy.  That��s pretty accurate, as long as you don't have the A/C on :)

I can also tell you everything you want to know about the interior.  After all, that's where I spend my time.  Did I mention how sharp the Bluestone exterior/Ivory leather interior combination is?  On top of that, the Limited model has the faux woodgrain accents on the dash, console, and doors.  The non-Limited models have a pearlescent gray accent as opposed to the woodgrain.  While the majority of the interior consists of the ivory seats and carpeting, the doors and dash are trimmed in a graphite color.  Really smart looking.  As of the time I purchased my Highlander, there were 3 overall interior options�Xivory leather, ivory cloth, and gray cloth.  

The rider comfort was another big selling point of this car.  There is ample room for 5 adults (2 front/3 rear) from top to bottom and front to back.  I am 5'11" and my husband is 6'2", and we both find leg room to spare both in the front and back seats.  The driver's seat is powered by 3 controls: front/back, up/down, and tilt.  I do have a small beef in that the front passenger seat is not powered, but has an adjustment bar under the seat (just like the Camry).

Standard audio includes an AM/FM radio with single CD player and 6 speakers.  My model has the AM/FM radio with 6 CD changer and 8 JBL speakers.  While the buttons and knobs are large enough for even chubby fingers, it takes a little while to get used to the CD controls, since they are merely the radio buttons re-purposed.  The sound is very nice, though I find that when hard objects are in the door side pockets, you get a little rattling sound when the volume is at a normal level.  

The only other beef I have about the car is the deafening "wop wop wop" you get when only the back window(s) is rolled down halfway.  This was a problem with the Camry (may still be), and it exists in the Highlander as well.  Fortunately, there is a window lock on the driver's door; great for deterring a wild child from deliberately annoying you with the window noise.

Nooks and crannies?  The Highlander is loaded with them.  The glove compartment is huge, as is the case in many Toyota models.  I keep all my car essentials in there.  Besides the owner's manual, I have a notebook, some air freshener, and some CDs.  There are pockets on the side of all 4 doors, which is a nice place to keep compact umbrellas and other necessities.  The center console is awesome--a great place to keep CDs and personal items you access frequently.  It has a neat opening method: you push a button and the top opens at the middle to allow complete access to the interior of the console.  There is also a really neat nook at the front of the console, on the underside (to the right of the driver's feet).  I think it's meant to be a place to stash a purse, but I have found it's the perfect size to keep my 60-CD case.

And the cupholders!  There are 6 in all, which is a lot for a vehicle of this size.  In addition to the 4 rear cupholders (2 on each door), there is a 2-cup holder at the front of the console area.  It's rectangular in shape, and there is a slide-up cover for the box when not in use.  There's a plastic divider that can be set into one of 3 positions, to enable more holding room for those 64 oz. Soda cups from the gas station.  In the 6 months I have owned my car, I have only had one spill in the front cupholders.  And that happened only because there was a hole in the bottom of the cup.  Anyway, the cupholders are all very good for keeping drinks in their place.  The greatest part about the front cupholders is that you can pop out the divider to clean the area very thoroughly.  One small note:  The rear cupholders display a warning that they are to be used for bottled drinks only.  Due to the curvature in the door just behind one of the cupholders, I can that some cups won't fit there well, so I try to use the front holder.  

The cargo area is ample for my family's basic needs.  We take lots of 2 and 3-day trips, and there is plenty of room for our bags along with all the comforts a 4-year old requires.  I should also mention there's yet another cubby in the cargo area; it's where I keep my first aid kit.  There are also 4 little "hooks" on which you can hang plastic grocery bags to keep them from rolling all around in the back.

The main point I'm trying to make?  I love the Toyota Highlander.  Whenever I get worked up about an important decision and sweat over whether I've made the right decision, I usually end up disappointed.  With the Highlander, that was simply not the case.  This is one of the best decisions I've made in my life, and I can honestly say that my Highlander has brought me a lot of joy.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who is even remotely considering it.

~~~~~
Though this has nothing to do with the Highlander itself, I am offering a suggestion to readers.  I've always been notorious for having an awfully messy vehicle.  The Highlander was my first new-car purchase, and I REFUSED to let this car end up like my others.  I keep a plethora of cleaning/protectant wipes in the cargo area for weekly and as-needed cleanings.  But the wisest investment I have made in my Highlander is the front and back-seat rubber liners.  I spent about $125 for 3 mats--2 for the front and a 1-piece for the back.  The liners cover to the edge of the carpeting, and they have already proved more valuable that what I paid for them, both in terms of potential accidents and the ease of clean-up.  If you're going to spend more than $25,000 on a car, you're almost foolish not to take the extra steps to keep it looking nice.  

Update:  The 2004 Highlander has just been introduced, and I noticed there are a few "convenience-related" changes that are worthy of mentioning.  First, there is now a 3rd row seat option.  Second, a power passenger seat is available.  Third, the gray leather interior is now an option (cloth was the only gray option previously).  Fourth, there is an option of radio controls on the steering wheel.
