            I bought my 2003 Dodge 1500 this past May. Engine wise all the talk in these trucks thus far has been in regard to the HEMI. However, unless your pulling large loads regularly (or just enjoy spending your money on gas) the 4.7 liter V8 (287 CID) is a much more sensible choice. My truck has the 4.7 liter- and I LOVE THIS ENGINE. The 4.7 is a much more refined engine than the HEMI (I've driven them both). The first thing I noticed about this engine was that it sounded really cool- quiet, but with a mellow V8 gurgle. This engine is by no means a wimp either. I recently helped a friend move. This involved several trips in stop-start Nashville, TN traffic pulling a loaded U-Haul 6'X 12' trailer. The truck handled a day of this without any sign of strain.

The truck also has a nice smooth and quiet ride, although not quite as good as the Chevy pickup in the same class (I test drove them all before I bought). The steering feels solid and the truck turns very sharp and crisp, especially for a vehicle of its size.

The prime selling point on the truck for me was the cab room. There is a full foot between the back of the seats and the back of the cab allowing enough space to pack a couple of suitcases, or keep groceries in out of the rain. However, the trade off for the extra cab space is the loss of some bed room, but for the average truck user this will likely not be missed and has been a more than worthwhile trade off for me. If you'd like to have some extra space without moving up to an extended cab pickup this truck is the only way to go.

I have the ST base model with the SXT package. This SXT option offers a great value. My truck looks sporty like the more expensive SLT trim line and includes most of the convenience items people want. The SXT upgrade includes chrome clad wheels, CD player, cruise, and tilt steering(no power windows or door locks which I have had to get used to not having). 

The interior of the truck is nice as well. As mentioned before, it is very roomy. The seat will accommodate three adults with reasonable comfort. Both doors have large handy storage compartments built in. The dash instruments and controls are simple, and for the most part logically placed and easy to use. An inconvenient exception to this would be the lack of a switch on the interior dome light itself. To turn it on the driver has to fumble with a dial type switch that only he can access.

All in all this is a great truck. I've been very happy with my buy.
