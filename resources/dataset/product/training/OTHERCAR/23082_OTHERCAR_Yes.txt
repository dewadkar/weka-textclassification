            I think this is the best camera I have ever owned. With 11 grandchildren 
I can finally get the pictures I have always wanted. If I don't like them I can delete it and take another one. I have saved so much money that I use to spend for a professional photographer. Now I can do professional pictures myself and save that money.I will never spend anymore money at a professional studio.
I purchased this product because of the name, and a friend had one. I saw some of the work they had done. I have always used polaroid products and
have never had any problems. I have always gotten good service.
Anyone would benefit from this product,almost everyone takes pictures.
A business person takes pictures for business purposes. Think of the pictures a family can take of there children, grandchildren, even friends.You don't have to wait for processing. That to me means a lot.
I can take my pictures , then hook my camera up to my computer which
only takes a minute,and print them out. I can print as many as I like, and any size I want.
I will never own another camera. This will take the place of even my camcorder.   <br><br>
