            The advantages of this car are as follows:
The 1993 Volvo 240 is one of the more reliable cars on the road today.  Repair costs are minimal, and with the proper upkeep this car could run forever.  This 1993 Volvo 240 has 170k miles on it and still is going strong.  The gas mileage is above average and the overall comfort of the ride is good.   The turning circle is incredible, you could literally do a U-Turn in the middle of a street w/o having any problems.  The braking ability along with emergency handling are absolutely amazing!  This car could almost stop on a dime at highway speeds if need be.  The car seldom needs to be repaired, though the repairs can be costly.  The engine is a 4 cylinder engine, but even though it's old it can still accelerate rapidly.  The transmission is great and has never needed any attention.  The trunk is quite bigger than most cars as well.  You could haul a large load in this car if need be.

The disadvantages this car has are as follows:
The car is long and narrow with small tires, so traction is very poor during slippery winter conditions.  The car seems to perform much worse than any other car I can imagine during winter driving.  If you are considering purchasing this car in an area where you have cold and snowy conditions I would recommend looking into another automobile.  This car would not be a wise decision to purchase if you live in some of the northern states and Canada.  In addition, this car would not accommodate a tall driver.  The drivers side is far too cramped for a tall person and does not offer enough leg or elbow room.  If you are any taller than 6'1'' do not even consider this car!  Another disadvantage of the car is the fact that it's not very sleek or streamline in design.  This car has remained virtually unchanged for around 15 years, and many of the features of this car are outdated and/or obsolete.  

This is a very reliable car, but sadly due to lack of leg room (for a tall person) and horrific winter traction I could not recommend this car.  It does offer precision steering, strong brakes, and above average gas mileage.  Volvo is a quality product, and will remain so for many years to come.  This is a great automobile for southern states, but do not consider this if you live in northern states and Canada.
