            I've had experience with sony's line of Mavica products for about 5 years.  I finally decided to buy my own digital mavica and decided on the FD88.

The clear advantage of this is the Floppy drive.  Take 30 pictures, pop in a new disk.  the megapixel is great for your high res pictures, but I usually leave it on 640x480 because, well that's big enough for me.  

The only complaints that I have are these.  No optical viewfinder, something that I would like, but isnt' necessary.  I like being able to turn the LCD backlight on and off, allowing for batery saving.  The other complaint I have is that it doesn't come with any kind of case, for $600, you would think they could include a vinyl case, but I was able to pick one up for less than $20.

The mpeg movie feature is great. All you need is a converter to quick time, and they make excelent additions to flash movies.

Applications for use:  I can't wait to take this on vacation, I will be able to take many more pictures than with any other digital camera, because I don't have a laptop to upload the pictures.  Since we're going to Disney, I can use the mpeg feature to make movies of parades and things.  Most of all, I want to use the camera for web development.  Movies and pictures into macromedia flash movies.<br><br>
