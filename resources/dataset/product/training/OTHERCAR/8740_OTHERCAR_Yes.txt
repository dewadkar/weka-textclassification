                  In the first place i bought this vehicle for its luxury,room,and its quick. I like this car because of its nice sleek look and is roomy interior. I think that this car is perfect for a family thats just starting out but wants that quality of a very nice car. It is very quiet and it has a great stero system in it. The price is very affordable for a starting family. A very large family should not look into this vehicle , but with a family with 2-4 persons in it THIS CAR IS EVERYTHING YOU COULD EVER WANT!!! It is alson one of the most dependable cars i have ever owned. over all this car is wonderfull.<br><br>
