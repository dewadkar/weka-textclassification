            I just purchased a 1997 Pontiac Bonneville one week ago.  I traded in a 1998 Toyota Corolla.  Most people said I was crazy to trade in such a reliable (and paid for) vehicle for a car payment.  But the Toyota was just TOO SMALL!

So far, I love my new car.  Even though it isn't brand new, you could never tell by looking at this vehicle.  The exterior is beautiful, and the all leather interior is spotless!  A luxury car with a sporty appearance.  The front bucket seats are so comfortable, I have to make sure I have had enough caffeine before leaving on a long ride!  The amenities in this car are endless.  From the double visors, to the radio and CD controls on the steering wheels, to the cup holders on each front door, to the back seat heater/AC ducts, this car is pure luxury.  The safety features include double side air bags , the radio controls on the steering wheel (so you don't take your eyes off the road), and child proof doors on the back passenger doors.  This one is a must for a mom with an active 3 1/2 year old boy!

The room in this car is realized when you slide into the butter soft leather seat in the back.  Passengers have ample leg room, along with many of the amenities that the driver has.  Perks include several storage areas, along with a pull down hatch to access the trunk.

The stereo/CD player sounds great, and if any of you have kids who are channel surfers, the controls on the steering wheel can really keep you in control of what is being listened to!

The only thing I would have to say that is negative on this car is the gas mileage, but remember, I had a Toyota Corolla so I expect that this is entirely normal!  Hey, I will pay a little more for the gas to get a ride this comfortable and luxurious!  Oh, and love the power!  6 cylinders is quite a difference!<br><br>
