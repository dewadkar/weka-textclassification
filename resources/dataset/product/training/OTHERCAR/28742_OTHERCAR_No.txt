            be aware that most mitsubishi cars are made buy chryler in usa and mexico. Because mitusbishi is $16 billion in debt chrysler bought them out and there the mutt of the auto industry.  Therefore i would not buy any mitsubishi out there. Go ahead and buy a toyota-nissan or a honda. sure some of the prices maybe higher buy its worth it. if you dont wan to be left stranded on the streets.
lets just face it that mitsubishi is just a name brand they might as well name the car 
<b>Crysler Eclipse</b> Because thats what it is.  <b>ITS AN AMERICAN CAR WITH A JAPANESE NAME</b> and keep in mind that there are some japanese cars with an american name-geo prizm etc.


Please note****  This opinion is to inform readers or future buyers of the car stated above and to prevent buyers from incurring money loss in the future. If you guys want to give me an HR fine. For those who want to give me an NR whatever. Im just tellin it like it is and if you dont like it whatever.


-----For the person who gave me a NR get your facts straoght before you give me an NR OK!!!!!


----And if you dont beleive me look in the latest issue of <b>
CONSUMER REPORTS USED CAR GUIDE!! </b>                

--Thank You
