            I have owned a Vivitar 2700N camera now for about 10 months. At first I thought that this was a decent deal. I paid about $160.00 for the camera and at that time I thought that I had made a good decision. 

When I got the camera the software loaded easily. The camera looked great and the pictures were what I expected for a camera with this type of resolution, but then I found out the real kicker. 

The camera doesn't take too bad of pictures when you can keep batteries in the thing. I used exactly what was recommended in the owners manual and I still had no luck getting them to last. I went out and purchased two sets of rechargeable batteries and a charger. I tried to rotate the batteries so that I would have fresh ones each time that I wanted to use the camera. The charger couldn't keep up with the camera!! It went through the batteries so fast even if you were taking standard resolution pictures, but try to use the flash and you might as well hang it up.

The pictures were mostly dark and yellow mostly because lack of using the flash when indoors. Then the thing started falling apart. The battery compartment door it made of a fairly thin plastic and it is only held on with two little plastic pins which are molded into the door. The tension on the batteries is so much that the door is utterly useless. The hinge broke on mine about 5 months after I got it and it wasn't used all that much during that time.

My suggestion is to spend the extra cash and get a good one. You might have to drop $400.00 but if you want good pictures and don't want to mess with trying to get your camera fixed or buy spare parts it would be worth it. 

I don't know about all Vivitar digital camera's but I would stay away from the 2700 because it isn't worth the headaches.<br><br>
