            The  PDC 3000 Digital Camera Kit is a GREAT camera.


 My friend got a new camera, and surprisingly let us borrow it.  I was amazed at all the options it gives you!
The PDC-3000 kit supplies the camera, software, an image storage disk and PC card, plus AC adapter, cables and documentation. 

The accessories include the , PhotMAX Image maker products CD-rom, Camera-to-TV Connector, 2mg memory card, Camera-to-computer connector (RS232 serial cable), AC power Adapter, and the Wrist Strap.

The special features include Self-timer LED, Optical viewfinder, Built in Flash, Sliding Lens Cover, 3 Distance settings, Tripod socket, Battery status indicator, Lock mode to prevent accidental deletion of photos, 4 different resolution settings, 640X480 super-high resolution (stores up to 12 images), 640x480 high resolution (stores up to 24 images), 640x480 standard resolution (stores up to 36 images), 320x240 stores up to 96 images.

There are 4 different flash settings as well. Auto, flash on, no flash, and flash with red eye prevention.
It offers a serial hookup connection to your pc or if no pc you can use the video cable and store them on a video tape.
 
Even though it has all the high end features, it is far less expensive, and easier to use.
