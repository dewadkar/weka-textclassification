            We use the Breeze at my office. Since we have a total of six cars (two of which are Breezes), there's a good chance if I need a car, I will have one of these. It is a good thing they are reliable. Featureless (since they are company cars) but reliable. 

Actually, the car has a few power goodies, with the operative word being 'few.' Power steering/locks/mirrors along with am AM/FM radio and air are about it. But despite those drawbacks, the ride is unaffected. The ride is smooth and quiet. After starting it up, if you are not listening,. you may not have heard it start. 

I happen to like the digital on-screen mileage embedded into the dashboard, but I happen to like those silly, inane 'high-tech' freebies that come with things. Maybe that digital on screen display is the reason that nobody over 170 pounds can fit in the back seat. This car says it seats five, but those 3 in the back better have done their jumping jacks.

The only problems we have had with our Breezes have been man-made: both have kissed metal once. Other than the problem of human error, these cars are perfectly fine and highly recommended. <br><br>
