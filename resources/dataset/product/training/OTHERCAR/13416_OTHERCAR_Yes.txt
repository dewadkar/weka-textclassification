            My husband and I purchased a used 1996 s10 Blazer before we were married.  Although there were some problems, as could be expected for an older model vehicle, we drove this SUV for 5 years.  I was the primary driver of the car, so it was mostly used as an errand car, and was usually driven around town.  Although we felt the car was reliable enough when we bought it to drive on an extensive vacation (1000 miles or so) we have generally avoided using it for long trips in more recent years.  The Blazer has, also, had problems with the 4 WD system since we got it.  It was very hard to engage the system, if it worked at all.

I generally enjoyed the ease of handling that this vehicle offered, but was very aware of the fact that it would roll easily.  It also did not offer very much room for a growing family, as it only had 4 seat belts.  The cargo area in back was quite large, though, and could carry quite a bit.

The Blazer also did not pick up well.  In other words, it tended to lag.  The engine was not as powerful as would be expected for an SUV.

I would recommend this vehicle to a small family, who wished to purchase a reasonable vehicle for &quot;about town&quot; purposes.  I do not think it will meet the needs of expanding families nor those who will travel frequently.    <br><br>
