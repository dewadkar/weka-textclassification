            I can still remember the day that I made the trek to the big auto show with my father.  I was 12 years old and completely immersed in the world of cars - I could have told you anything you wanted to know about every European car sold in the US.  At the end of our visit we made our way over to the Peugeot booth where I found my to-be childhood dream car...a silky, jet-black 405 Mi16 sports sedan.

From the first time I saw its crisp, modern Pinninfarina lines and smelled the buttery-soft leather interior I was sold!  Even with Lamborghini, Lotus, and Ferrari at the show, this was the car I wanted.

Well, today it resides in my garage (sort of).  In 1995 I found my 1989 405 &quot;S&quot; sedan.  It's champagne rather than black and, unfortunately, not the 150 horsepower 16V performance version (the Mi16).  I snatched the car up quickly, though, as they're a very rare commodity in North America.  Roughly 1,500 were sold each year from 1989 to 1992 in the US (not a lot).  I was sold on Peugeot when my father drove his '79 504 diesel wagon to 300,000+ miles on its original engine and transmission before selling it.  This made my decision an easy one.

You might wonder why I'm spending so much time talking about the company.  The reason?  Peugeot/Citroen (PSA) is actually one of the larger worldwide car makers...period!  Yet, 99.99% of Americans think that Peugeot went out of business when they left the American market in 1992 due to poor sales.  Poor marketing and the shaky reliability from all European cars during the 1980's killed this car's chances in the US before it even arrived here on our shores.

The Peugeot 405 is a car that could have changed perceptions if American journalists had given it a fair shake.  In 1988 it won &quot;European Car of the Year&quot; by the largest margin ever in the award's history.  The car, whether in 110 horsepower (DL and S) or 150 horsepower (Mi16) form, performs beautifully.  The ride is unbelievably smooth for a car this size and yet it is nimble enough to out-perform many sports cars on twisty backcountry roads.  The engine is smooth and responds with an intense, soul-satisfying roar from about 3500 rpm's up to the redline (the Mi16 revs freely to 7K).  The rear suspension incorporates an odd &quot;floating&quot; setup that takes a little getting used to, but manages to keep the car completely flat during hard braking by actually pulling the rear closer to the ground.  The combination of engine, suspension, and low drag coefficient (.28) make the 405 a stable &amp; secure high-speed cruiser that seams to really come alive over 100mph.  It averages returns of 34mpg on the highway and 26mpg in the city

The interior is distinctively European.  The driving position is nearly ideal.  The dashboard and windshield are low, the visibility is great, and the steering wheel is far enough away to keep you alert and in control at all times.  The sport-line seats are highly bolstered and supportive, yet I could sit in them all day long (which I have).  The car's wide stance provides an interior so roomy that you feel as though you're sitting in a full-sized car.  The leather package puts buttery soft leather almost everywhere you touch.  The plastics are nicely sculpted and place the important controls within easy reach (my only complaint being the far reach for the front power window switches).  The gauges, controls, and switches are all illuminated in a soft reddish-orange glow.  The rear switches are placed on the center console along with the heated seat and power mirror controls (where the front switches should have been placed as well).  The automatic climate control is great, keeping the cabin well ventilated and exactly at the temperature you dial in.  The AC is always ice cold and the heat is almost too intense at times.  The glass sunroof is large and can be tilted upward or slid completely into the roof.  The rear bucket-style bench is the most comfortable back seat I have ever experienced...ever.  It can accommodate three in reasonable comfort, but two in &quot;extreme&quot; comfort.  With one arm on the door's armrest and the other on the center fold-down armrest, you might mistake yourself for royalty.  The front seats allow feet to slide easily underneath, offering plenty of legroom.  The trunk is simply huge and a long ski bag is hidden inside a flip-down door behind the rear armrest.

Outside, the shape is simply beautiful and elegant in every way.  The design, like most modern-day Peugeots, was sculpted by the same styling house that Ferrari uses.  The slanted hood line leads down to a pair of cat-eye headlights centering the chrome lion emblem.  The roofline begins with a steeply-raked windshield and ends with an equally steep rear window.  The tail ends as fluidly and elegantly as the front begins.  The taillights wrap around, connected by a red reflective panel with nicely whited-out directional indicators.  The tailpipe is tucked discreetly underneath the rear bumper (I hate cars with pronounced tailpipes-what an ugly thing to show off).  The door handles are recessed and flat.  The best move by the stylist is the crisp line that wraps around the front of the hood and culminates at the top of the rear taillights.  It's such a simple move, but it distinguishes the car from the parking lots filled with such bland cars as the Camry and Accord.  The look is clean and reminiscent of the Alfa Romeo 164.  

The best part about owning this car has been its reliability record.  Quite simply, it has been extremely good to me over the past five years.  The car is now approaching 160,000 miles (90,000 of which are my own) and for the most part, nothing has failed me.  It's a three-time 4000-mile roadtrip veteran.  In it's 11 years, the only engine components replaced have been the alternator, water pump and starter.  Not once has the car ever left me stranded.  The alternator and starter suffered slow deaths, allowing sufficient time to acquire new parts and install them myself.  The water pump cracked, causing a non-catastrophic coolant leak (that one was done by a local shop).  Other than that, it's been routine maintenance that has kept it running smoothly.  I think that if you compare my 405's reliability with almost any other car, you'll find its record is quite good.  Both my brother and mother drive Accords ('89 and '91).  In both cases they have paid more in maintenance costs over the last five years than I have (and at lower mileageï¿½s, too).  The moral of the story is not to fall for the myth that owning a Honda or Toyota is a guarantee of perfect reliability.

As for the future, I have every belief that this car will survive well beyond 200,000 miles.  The engine runs and sounds great and the transmission is fluid and vibration free.  Through an online message board, I have met several 405 owners with cars still happy in their mid-200's.  As it stands, parts are still easily acquired through former Peugeot dealers around the country-for how long I don't know.  The worst-case scenario is that the part must be shipped over from Europe, which really isn't that bad (or expensive).  Rumors are floating that Peugeot will return to this market, but I'm not holding my breath.  I'm also not expecting that they'll be eager to service my soon-to-be classic.

My chief complaint is that the car burns a slight amount of oil.  This was a common problem on the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;DL&quot;, due to bad valve guides.  The smart owners had this repaired under warranty.  Unfortunately, the original owner of my car did not.  At it's worst it drinks a quart about every 1000 miles.  The problem was known so early in production that the original owner's manual actually tells you to expect it (B.S. that should have caused a recall).  Luckily, it's not burning enough to cloud behind the car.  You can't see it but you can smell it.  The &quot;Mi16&quot; has a completely different head and, therefore, never had this problem.

Another complaint is the extensive use of plastic parts in the car's interior.  When I first bought the car, I was overcome by rattles and buzzing from the dashboard and doors.  I ended up pulling the plastic components apart and reassembling them with felt to quiet the rattles.  It worked.  Road and tire noise was also fairly pronounced in the cabin.  I managed to improve this by applying a special noise-reducing coating to the underbody and wheel wells.  Lastly, over the past two years the paint on my roof has crazed (a web of hairline cracks in the paint surface).  This is a common on several Peugeot paint colors and lots of other European cars during the late-80's, including BMW.

My final complaint goes back to my first argument.  Americans love to hate this car company-a car company that they no very little about.  Mechanics and the radio show 'Click and Clack' have unfairly chosen Peugeot as the official whipping boy for the auto industry.  I had a tune up done by a German mechanic at 80,000 miles.  He swore that the car wouldn't reach 90K.  When it did, he then told me it wouldn't pass 100K (and he put his word on that).  Well, he was wrong (I try to remind him whenever possible).  As for Peugeot's image over here, things are looking up.  Recently, an American car magazine ran a story on the ten-best cars that are not available in the US.  Out of the ten, Peugeot grabbed two of the spots.  One for the 406 Coupe and the other for the 306 Gti.

I hope that I have done some good in changing your perception of this car model and Peugeot in general (sorry for the length).  I want to take this opportunity to whole-heartedly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for something fun and unique.  If you buy one, I can almost guarantee that you'll be the only one on your block to own one.  You can rest assured that purchasing one is a fairly safe move since you can pick up an &quot;S&quot; for under $3000 and an &quot;Mi16&quot; for around $4000.  

I would personally recommend that the &quot;DL&quot; be avoided.  It's a sound car, but not a very exciting one.  The &quot;DL&quot; is basically an &quot;S&quot; that has been stripped of the comfortable leather seats, upscale luxuries, alloy wheels and power features.
