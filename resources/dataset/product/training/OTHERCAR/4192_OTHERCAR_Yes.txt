            We bought our 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan SE because we needed more vehicle space. We are foster/adoptive parents, so we never know how many kids we are going to have to transport.

We just love the leg room and space that the Grand Caravan has to offer. The seating is comfortable and roomy. There are two back seats and both have easy access in and out. The seats also recline so the kids can nap on long trips and anyone that has kids know that when they sleep on long trips it is a blessing. The seats are removable if you need to haul something large. There is plenty enough space behind the back seat for luggage, camping equipment, etc. There is a large hatch-back type door to access that area. Another great thing is the two sliding doors, one on each side. They make it so easy to get the kids in and out, especially if you have little ones still in a car seat.

The ride is so smooth, it feels like you are riding in a luxury car, and not a van. The gas mileage is great for a mini van. We get about 22 miles  to the gallon on the highway and about 19 in town.

The only problem we have found, is that you can hear an airflow sound when driving on the highway sometimes. But other than that we love our Caravan.<br><br>
