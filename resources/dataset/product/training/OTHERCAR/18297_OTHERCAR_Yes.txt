            Let me describe this truck to you first off, it is a 2001 Dodge Ram 2500 V10 SLT+ with every option except cab clearance lights, and an autmatic transmission.

This truck has many great things going for it, and some other things that may make some people shy away.

First off the good.
The V10 488cid gas powerplant produces gobs of horsepower(even more than the 6 cyl diesel) and almost as much torque as the diesels available on the market.  This engine has allowed me to pull huge loads and trailers over all of the passes that I've gone over so far, without the vaporlock problems previous dodge trucks, no GM truck can come close this trucks power and torque.

Next the interior is very appointed, including a CD player, leather, heated bench seats, and enough headroom for a 6'4&quot; man to sit comfortably, the gages are big and easy to read, with the proper options, the cruise and stereo controls are on the steering wheel so that you don't need to take your eyes off the road.

The frame is one of the best things and the worst things about this truck, it is an extremely ridged steel style frame which on road is the best for carrying loads and pulling weight, (Ford uses a less ridged frame which allows for flex) however off-road performance is slightly reduced, this ridged frame also causes quite a rough ride at freeway speeds, unless you have some weight in it.  Myself, I wouldn't have it any other way, I would rather pull a large load, that risk permanently damaging the truck due to torsion twist.

Now the downs:
This truck has very few downsides, here they are:
Diesel, Dodge has released a new Cummins diesel to replace the V6, this is great, but the engine is new and unproven.
Also this truck has a solid front end, while it is a stronger setup than using multiple u-joints, it provides for a rougher ride than the Ford of GM trucks.

After it is all said and done, the Dodge is still the best gas fuel choice on the market, as Ford's V10 doesn't have the horsepower/torque range that the dodge engine does, and the dodge is a proven engine.<br><br>
