            These cars are fabulous on all levels - every Stealth and every 3000GT ever made, but especially the 2nd generation (94+) models.  I must disagree slightly with Maximumc2's opinion in a few places (and I'll try not to suck up too much bandwidth):  

I'm the Administrator for &quot;Team3S&quot;, the international owners' group (and website) for Stealth and 3000GT (630+ sign-ups from 27 countries) and I have a different 'take' about the transmission topic.  Only an adjustment  TSB was ever issued about the automatic transmission, never a recall, for any year through 1999.  (FYI, the last 3000GT manufactured was made in early 1999, including the &quot;2000 model&quot; [?] year). The 5-speed manual tranny is relatively flawless, but the &quot;problem child&quot; is the 6-speed manual Getrag transmission, *when it is abused*.  When modifying the car (many of us DO a 'few' mods to our cars), the added power of $1000 worth of aftermarket equipment gives about 400 HP, 4.3 second 0-60 times, and 13 second 1/4 miles.  (Our high-HP, streetable champ member does 10.8 sec @ 130MPH.)  Coupled with hard launches (or even bad technique), the combination of raw power and a very heavy car often result in drive-line failures when repeatedly testing the car to it's limits.  And the arrangement between Mitsu and Getrag is that parts are NOT available - just a switch for another tranny (with a few months downtime and a $6000 pricetag, if not under warranty).  But the automatics rarely need replacement (I've heard of ONE failure), and are very reliable.

The second disagreement is your comment about the base model being underpowered:  There were two 'base' models during the years these cars were made:  The Stealth had only a 164 HP base, but the 3000GT base was a 170 HP SOHC or a 220 HP DOHC (depending on the year).  Out of the box, these cars are still very quick, especially considering their weight.  But again, with &lt;$1000 of legal add-ons, our members' 220 HP models turn in 1/4 mile times in the mid-14 second range (~100MPH).  That's pretty respectable for a non-turbo that's not designed to set speed records.  Even my lowly 164 HP Stealth (with $800 of mods) does 7 sec 0-60 and 95MPH 15 sec 1/4 mile times.  Not record-breaking, but certainly not what you'd call underpowered.  In muscle-car terms, those HP numbers seem low, but since a 3-liter 220HP 3/S beats a 4-liter 280HP Mustang that's 500 lbs lighter, one must rethink what HP numbers mean, and instead, consider how fast the car goes.  When you add the fact that with safe tires, even a base 3/S cruises comfortably at 120+, you have a VERY unique vehicle, safe at any speed.

While on the subject, the VR4s and TTs cruise at up to 155MPH stock, and we have 3 European members (at least) who regularly travel the autobahn at speeds in the 170-175MPH range.  These cars ARE a match for anything on the road under about $135,000, at roughly 1/3 the price.  And I mean a styling match as well - our cars are just beautiful.  

And before anyone gets to comparing 1/4 mile champs - sure, there are 9-second Hondas and Talons, but that's not what these cars are for (although we do it respectably).  You strap a jet engine on a skateboard and it will go fast, but that's not why you buy a Gran Tourismo car.  We run with Porsche and Ferrari and C5 and Lingenfelter Firebirds in Auto-X...  That a stripped Honda can turn 8 seconds can't compare with a VR-4 passing a Ferrari F40 on a roadcourse curve at 100+ MPH!

The third point, about comfort, is strictly subjective - if you found the car uncomfortable, I'm sure that's true, but I just wanted to voice a different opinion--  Many of our members race in Porsche Club, 'Vette club, Road America, SCCA, BMWCC, etc, plus we have regular 3/S gatherings all over the country.  Ten hour trips are not uncommon, and most of us find the trips extremely comfortable.  I've done 11 and 13 hours just this year..., comfortably.  YMMV.
