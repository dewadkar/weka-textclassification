            I bought this vehicle because I love the General Motors SUV line.  I saw this vehicle on the lot and I instantly fell in love with it.  Electric moonroof.  Cd player.  All the bells and whistles.  And it was a special edition too, called Premier.  It's been 2 years now and I can't wait until my lease is up!  It's fun to drive if you have the radio loud enough to cover the sound of the interior rattling.  I have had it &quot;fixed&quot; more than once but it still rattles.  Now I know why I've never seen another Premier on the road.  I was the only sucker.  The hatchback rattles along with the spare tire on the back, which was another mistake I made.  I've also had to have the stereo replaced.  I can't say anything bad about my 1996 Chevy Blazer 4Dr which I replaced with this Premier.  But I can never speak highly of it.  Only 1 more year to go!<br><br>
