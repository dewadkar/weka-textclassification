            Trucking around with children; They should be comfortable also!  Recently my wife and I started shopping around for a pickup truck as a second family vehicle.  Actually, it will be a third vehicle, however, we only have two licensed drivers in the family.  We have two children.  One that is young, age 10, and the other, now fourteen, is as large a an adult male.  Finding a pickup truck that will fit our need, (we wanted it to haul our camper, and to have for daily commuting), and would still be comfortable for the children to ride in during our family vacations, turned out to be a real chore.  Of the three major models, Ford F-series, Dodge Rams, and Chevy Silverado we only really found one to be acceptable.  The Ford was truly a nice 'truck', but was really short on the comfort aspect.  And lets face it, a family truck is only really used as a truck once in a while, so it really becomes a family sedan with a really large trunk.  The Dodge Ram was nice inside, and, had the comfort and power to do all the things a family would want.  It's only real draw back was that it seemed cheap and noisy.  The engine alone drowned out the voices of the passengers, and the rear seat was really cheap.  Our final choice was the Chevy Silverado (or it's sister the GMC Sierra).  This vehicle drives like a fine sedan, has a rear seat that is very comfortable, and functional, and as far a power goes, it's a champion.  We are positive that this vehicle will be trucking our family, camper, wood, dog, and children around for a very long time.
