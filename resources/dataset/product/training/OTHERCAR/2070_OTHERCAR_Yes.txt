            I have now been using this camera for about 8 months and I'm really happy with it. I'm not a photo nut, I just wanted a low-priced camera which would take reasonable quality pictures, and the Agfa CL20 exceeded my expectations. With a memory card it can take 46 1280 x 960 photos and the quality is pretty good. You have to be careful about using the flash indoors, but you can switch the auto flash on or off. The slight delay between taking photos doesn't bother me - I find that by the time I'm ready to take another shot, the camera is almost always ready. The timer is useful if you want a photo of yourself. 

The camera is so small that it can fit comfortably into a pocket, making it very easy to carry around. It would be nice not to have to upload the photos to a PC to view them, but if you want an LCD screen, I guess you have to pay for it. 

In general I feel really happy with it every time I use it, and I would recommend it to anyone.
