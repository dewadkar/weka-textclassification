            I bought this camera last summer and gotten good use out of it since.  I really liked the Canon brand of digital image solutions.  Like most people I tend to research a month or so before buying anything over a few Ben Franklins.  I was getting a ton of positive feedback about this camera.  My father has a Ricoh camera that is a few years old.  I wanted to have the same features he had, mostly video out.  At the time I was looking into this one, not all cameras had video out.  I thought it was important to show pictures without messing with a computer.  I liked the fact it had compact flash over smart media.  Compact flash dropped in price and allowed me to get 64 meg card really cheap.  There were a ton of people raving about the advanced features, saying they have just hit the tip of the iceberg after a few months.  Now that I've had some time to test drive the camera, I figure I've used most features to give a good review.

Like most digital camera, I have good rechargables that I've always used.  I found a good review on rechargables and have used them ever since.  I noticed right out of the box that the camera is heavy.  This is not a compact, pocket camera like some other digital cameras on the market.  If you want a small pocket camera then look elsewhere.  After a few pictures I liked the quality.  My father has a 1 MP and I really noticed how good 2 MP is.  I set up the software in a breeze and was downloading pictures in a snap.  Software is very easy to set up and use.  I consider myself an advanced computer user but I know anyone can use this and have no problems.  It even has automated tasks to run when you plug your camera into the computer.  For instance, download all pictures/download all new pictures/print a contact sheet.  The photo browser software is very nice.  I think software gets over looked when buying a camera, I really like the ease of this, sorting my pictures/albums, is a joy!  The program also has a stitching software, which allows you to take pictures in stitch mode, then attach them on your computer.  Basically you can make panaramic pictures.  This is very easy as well.  The display on the camera shows you the over lap, which really helps taking pictures that will be stitched together later.  Takes out all the guess work.  This camera has the capability to take movies.  I've done it on a small scale.  This camera is not in lou of a camcorder.  The resolution is low and movies are grainy full screen.  Remember you buying a still camera not a camcorder.  But it is a nice function to get a few seconds of clips.  It allows sound which is also nice.  Videos do take up a lot of memory so be prepared.  Like I said it's a nice feature that came with the camera, kind of a bonus.

The advanced features are excellent.  For instance I can change the film speed and F-stop.  This opens the door to many possibilities.  This is what sold me on the camera.  I will say that for the 6+ months I've had it, I've really only used the automatic setting.  There were a few times that I went out on a limb and tried other settings.  For instace lightning.  No way can you take lightning pictures, fairly dark out, in automatic mode.  I will say I didn't get that one shot but came damn close.  Sunset pictures came out good once I slowed down the speed.  Problem I ran into was I needed a tripod.  Another great feature is multiple shots.  This camera will allow you to take multiple shots like a 35mm.  You have to tweak the camera to do it.  For instance change the resolution, turn the display off.  It came in hand when shooting some action photos.  

That covers mostly all the camera.  I really love it and will continue to use it for years to come.  I think it is a great investment that will pay for itself over the year.  I highly recommend a good photo quality printer, I have the Canon S750.  I can easily print borderless prints, any size, and preserve my photos.  Digital cameras are great because you don't need to develop film, but you still need to show pictures beyond the computer.

Total I spent was 300 for the camera, 30/40 for the rechargables, and another 40/50 for the compact flash card.
