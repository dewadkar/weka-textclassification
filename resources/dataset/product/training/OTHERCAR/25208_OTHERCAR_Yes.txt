            I have had a subaru for over ten years.  I just recieved a 92 subaru legacy from my father.  He bought it in 1992.  It has been very reliable, even in the harsh chicago weather.  The gas milege is pretty good, and i have not had many difficulties.  It has great leg room in the back, and a huge trunk.  It has a pretty good radio system, and a good interior.  I know that every day when i wake up and start my car,l that it will start and get me to school on time.  I like to have girls in the back of my Subaru!!!  That is the best part.  It is no BMW or Mercedes, but I love it.  It is true that Subaru is the second safest car on the market, behind VOLVO.
Anyways, if you want to have women in your car, get a subaru and have a great day.  Don't forget to buckle up, and strap on some protection!
Thanks for reading this.
