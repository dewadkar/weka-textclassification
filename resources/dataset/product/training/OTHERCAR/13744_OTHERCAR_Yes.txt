            First the stats:

The Sony Cyber-Shot Smart Zoom DSC-P92 is 5 Mega Pixels with a 3x optical zoom and MPEG Movie VX. When purchased, it includes size AA nickel metal hydride batteries (rechargeable) with a battery charger, A/V Connecting cable, 16MB (about 7 pictures or 1 movie) Memory stick, USB Cable and Photo software. Auto focus (no manual focus) and flash.

This camera does well on batteries. About 135 minutes on a full charge. The camera also has a power save function that will turn it off if you forget. You can use the rechargable batteries that come with the camera but if you run out and in a pinch, you can use regular AA size batteries to keep going. It does not come with an AC Adaptor (Cost approx. $39.99)

The buttons to switch between photo taking, photo viewing, taking movies, and set up are all external which is a nice feature because on some cameras I've used, to switch those modes you have to go "inside" the camera on the LCD and go through a menu.

You can set the time and date and have it stamp your photos if you wish with the time, date, or both.

There are 5 image sizes. (5M, 4.5M, 3.1M, 1.2M and VGA) These differences are explained as ranging from fine quality to web page quality and allowing for quicker email download attachments) The 5M are unbelievably clear. And I love to have my photos printed by a service (Like Fotki.com) so clearity is a major issue for me.

There are 6 modes to take still pictures. Twilight, Twilight portrait, landscape, snow, beach, and auto. Some modes like twilight, requires a longer shutter capture time, which means your subjects must stay still longer (difficult with a 5 and 2 year old!)

The zoom button is easily operated by your right thumb. 

Another feature is the self-timer, which is also easy to turn on and off with the buttons on the outside of the camera instead of having to go into a menu. Red-eye reduction is reduced by the flash pre-strobes but it also creates a longer shutter time. I've found the red "laser-like" light that's on the front of the camera greatly reduces red-eye without using the flash pre-strobe light.

It's a simple flip of a switch to view already taken photos. You can quickly, but not mistakenly delete photos right from the camera. You can view one photo at a time or in index form.

With the A/V cable that is supplies, you can connect your camera to a television to view your photos and movies.

The manual does a good job of explaining the modes and features of this camera. It will also assist in set up of the camera best suited for your style of pictures.

Special effects include: solarize, sepia, negative-art, and making MPEG movies. You can rotate still images and create new folders to separate and store pictures on the camera. You can also resize an image on the camera after it is taken.

The accompanying software is nothing special, but easy to use and serves it's purpose.

Accessories that can be purchased separately:
Carrying cases ($19.99 - $34.99)
AC Power Adaptor ($39.99)
Tripods ($19.99 - $49.99)
Lenses/Filters ($29.99 - $99.99)
Memory Sticks (32MB - 1GB = $29.99 - $639.99)
Photo printers and Online services also available

Bottom line is it was a great camera choice for me because right now, I'm a novice to digital cameras. But as my knowledge grows, this camera will grow along with me. It's a little pricey,but keeps me from having to upgrade in a couple months when I realize there are things I don't have that I want. This camera has them already, I just don't know how to use them yet ;o)
