            My wife and I have a 2001 Ford Windstar that she mainly drives with our 2 sons.  I was driving a 1983 Toyota pickup to work and school.  Well, I got into graduate school in a city about an 1.5 hours away (Charleston, SC).  I needed a dependable car that could get me to class and back safely and with good gas mileage.  The Kia Spectra was a car that I became aware of while shopping for minivans (looked at Kia's Sedona).  My mother-in-law in Ohio also has a 2001 Spectra (the hatchback) and I only heard good things from her.  I researched the car and the prices and got a great 5.49% loan from my credit union and went out and got my Kia Spectra.
First, I am 6 feet 2 inches tall and I hate having to bend down too low to get in a small car.  The Spectra has decent clearance (unlike our old 1996 Saturn SW2 which used to hurt my hips getting in and out).  The driver's seat has an 8 way adjustment and the steering wheel is easy to adjust.  I could ride in the back if I wanted; but, the ride is a bit tight for big folks.  My 4 year old thinks it's great.  I got the LS model which has standard AC, adjustable mirrors, mudflaps, power locks and windows, and 6 speaker sound system.  The styling of this four door sedan is impressive and reminds me of the Civic and the 2001 Nissan Sentra (which my sister bought in January).  This doesn't look like the economy Rio and has a much bigger engine (128hp, same as Nissan Sentra).  My wife got a 1995 Geo Metro when we first got married and that thing was the quintessential economy car.  It felt like you were driving a go-cart.  The Spectra is not in the same league.  Smooth acceleration with the 4 speed automatic with OD makes for a nice ride.  The car handles well at speeds of 70 and greater without feeling almost out of control or shaking.  I wanted the ABS brake system; but, that is hard to find.  The steering does shake a little when braking from higher speeds; but, the braking is ample and even.  The interstate ride is sufficient and relatively quiet.  The cruise works great on the open road.  In other words, this little sedan is just what I need right now, a dependable 2nd car that is safe enough for carrying my 2 sons if need be and stylish enough for work and school.
So far, I have averaged 27.5 mpg driving to work which includes a commute of 15 miles each way with about 5 stoplights.  Not bad, I'm sure the interstate ride will be in the mid 30's.I have had this car for a month and have not had any problems.  I had a JVC CD player put in by the dealer since I didn't want the tape player.  The 6 speaker system (including door mounted tweeters) puts a smile on my face every drive.  Hey, this ain't no BMW; but, since I already had one van payment to make each month, I didn't have any more room in budget for much more.   I feel like I got a great deal (got it for less than MSRP with the $2000 cash rebate, plus the cruise and CD player were extras I bargained for) for a great little car.
