            The Subaru Legacy is a habit with my family.  We have owned four Subaru station wagons, two of which were 1982 models and thus, pre-Legacy.  Subaru makes one of the best automobiles one the market, a real value.  We still have one of the two 1982 models, the other having been retired to the junkyard after more than 300,000 miles!  

Our first Legacy wagon was a replacement for a Chrysler minivan, and was totaled in a front- and rear-end collision (we were in the middle!) from which my son and I walked away without a scratch.  The current model is a &quot;no-frills&quot; model, but a real value nonetheless.  It has over 185,000 miles, is a 1996 model purchased to replace the 1990 model (200,000+ miles).  

The only disadvantage of the car is that some parts are a little expensive, but this is balanced by the fact that with routine maintenance there is little need for replacement parts!  If the car does have any disadvantages, it is that it is a little short on back-seat leg-room for my son, who is 6 feet 2 inches tall!<br><br>
