            Yes, that's right.  I did it.... I changed a tire for the very first time in all of my 24 years.  This was quite an accomplishment for someone of my mechanical ability.  The extent of my skills until now was my uncanny ability to call my father's mechanic and make noises so that he could tell me exactly what was wrong with my car (this was my old car by the way, I have yet to have to make any noises for the Saturn!)

I have been driving my Saturn SL1 for about 3 1/2 years.  I am quite happy with my car.  Admittedly, I am not the best driver in the world.  I have a few speeding tickets under my belt and a couple crashes.  The Saturn has some great features to help me overcome my driving inadequacies.

First, let me mention the plastic side panels.  At first I was skeptical, but they have been a blessing!  I can't tell you the number of times my door has been opened right into the post next to my parking space.  However, if I were unwilling to admit that fact, no one could ever prove it!  When my 3 year old steers the shopping cart right into the car, not a mark!  When open the passenger door of my husbands very large, steel car not a dent on the Saturn!

My next favorite feature is the rubber bumpers!  I have hit quite a few posts and parking blocks, only to bounce right off.  This summer I was at a stoplight and the light turned green, everybody goes, and then the car in front of me just stopped!  Well, needless to say I didn't, and hit him quite forcefully!  We got out of the car and found nothing.  Not a dent in his metal bumper, and certainly nothing showing on mine (well, maybe a little dirt fell off!)  He got back in his car and left-- didn't even have to have that one on my insurance!

That is another great bonus- insurance is quite cheap.  Well, not cheap, but for someone with a few dings on her record, it is fabulous!  I'm assuming that a clean driver would pay very little to insure this vehicle.

In all of the time I have owned this vehicle, I have only had one real problem.  The cooling fan quit working last summer.  It was only about $75 to have that fixed, nothing compared to the troubled cars I have had in the past.

Back to the problem that prompted me to write this, my flat tire.  Keep in mind, I have had this vehicle for nearly 4 years and not replaced the tires (like I said, I'm not real good with cars).  A friend pointed out that my tire was flat, and typically me, I forgot to have it checked.  The very next day on my way out of town that tire went flat.  I was panicked.  It would be 45 minutes before my hubby could come bail me out.  So, I pulled out the manual and looked up changing a tire.  

The directions seemed so easy, I thought surely I could tackle this.  I pulled the spare out of the trunk, along with the included jack and went to work.  It was remarkably easy to do.  My only minor problem was I am not that strong and had a little difficulty loosening the nuts.  Once that was accomplished, I whipped the compact spare right on, tossed the flat tire in the trunk and went on my way.  

Here is the best part, the manual stated that the compact spare was good for speeds up to 65 mph for 3000 miles!  I was able to go about my busy weekend and have the tire replaced on Monday.  The new tire was $45 and I am back on the road with no worries thanks to my Saturn!
