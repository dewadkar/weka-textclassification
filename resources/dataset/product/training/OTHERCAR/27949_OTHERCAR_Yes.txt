            I have had the Audi A4 Quattro 1.8T for about 9 months now. This car really handles fantastic, especially now that we have slippery roads in the northeast the four wheel drive gets me uphill through my unshuffled driveway with ease.
I have the sports option package with the stiffer suspension, 16 inch wheels, the nice looking (even with airbag) sports steering wheel. The car also has the Tiptronic transmission which let you decide between automatic or shifting the gears on a  curvy country road.
My car came pretty loaded with the Bose sound system including CD changer in the trunk. The fully automatic climate control works nice too.

There are 2 gripes I have about this car. The 1.8T version is only available with manually adjustable seats. Whenever my wife uses the car she changes the position because of her shorter legs and also the height of the seat. It takes me forever to find my &quot;right&quot; position again after she drove the car. I would have definitely paid extra for electric seats with memory.
The other gripe is probably more dealer related. I think because Audi includes the free maintenance for three years with their cars it makes it more difficult to get appointments for service without long planning ahead. The A4 1.8T version needs to go in for service every 5,000 miles.
Getting an appointment is usually 3-4 weeks from when you call. As I am travelling a lot and go places on short notice, canceling the appointment and getting another one can be a hassle.<br><br>
