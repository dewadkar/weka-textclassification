            This car is very good for its price. The power of this car is amazing and the V-8 engine puts out a lot of power. The only problem with this car is the gas consumption. But like all other SUV's, it takes up a lot of gas. So if you are looking for a more economical car then this isn't for you. The trucks space when u put down the third row seat is huge and could carry a lot of thing in it. But then when you put up the third seat to fit more people, the space is very limited but you could still fit a few bags in the back. Another problem is that if you want to wash the car yourself, it takes a really long time and is very tiring.  This car performance is very good and could fit a lot of people in it too.<br><br>
