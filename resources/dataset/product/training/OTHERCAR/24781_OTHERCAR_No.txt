            I was an owner of this car for 2 years.  I bought this car in 1998.  I shopped around for months before making my decision.  I ultimately decided to buy the Sebring Coupe LXi solely because of its looks.

The 1998 Sebring LXi that I purchased was fully equipped: 
black on tan leather
power everything, AC, cruise, etc...
V6, 24 valve engine developing 150 horsepower

The car was absolutely beautiful.  It was extremely roomy inside, it easily sat 5, 6-foot adults. The trunk was enormous, larger than most other cars.  Fit and finish was impeccable. The seats were very comfortable. The ride was very smooth, and the handling was excellent. You could take very hard corners, and the car would never over steer.

As far as bad points are concerned there were many with this car.  My first major complaint would be that the car was underpowered.  This car needed an engine that would develop at least 200 hp.  With the 150 hp engine that it came with, acceleration was nonexistent.  The first 15 000 kilometers (break in period according to the manufacturer) cost a fortune in gas.  The car consumed twice its normal consumption.  Normal highway consumption was supposed to be 36 mpg, I was lucky if I would get 18 mpg.  After 15 000 kilometers the car did finally achieve its 36 mpg rate. The turning radius was very large.  You could forget about ever making a U-turn in one full swing. The mag wheels that came with the car were 17&quot; alloys. I found them to be too soft.  The area where I live had problems with potholes, and within 6 months all 4 rims were dented. 

After a year of owning the car, the engine light kept turning on inexplicably, and the car would stall on humid days or when it would rain. I went numerous times to the dealer, but they were never able to find the problem.  

 I also had problems with visibility.  The rear of the car was so high that backed up was merely impossible. Most of the time I would hope and pray that I would not bump the car behind me.  

Last but not least there were no compartments to put anything.  I had to keep my CD's on the floor, my sunglasses took up the only available compartment that there was in the car.

The only difference between the 2000 model, and the 1998 is that the 2000 model now comes equipped with a 253 hp engine.  Now we're talking!

After selling the car, with all the problems that it had, I still find myself staring at every Sebring that drives by.  I still think the Chrysler Sebring is one of the nicest cars around.

I do not recommend the 1998 Chrysler Sebring LXi, but I would be tempted to buy the 2000.
