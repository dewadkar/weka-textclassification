            Purchased this camera primarily to take web shots.  Was considering the Sony P50 based on its image quality and macro mode specs, this one came in close with regard the the macro specs and included battery, charger and memory, where the Sony did not.  Great value for the money.  Camera has several presets that allow for point and click shooting with exposure, balance and other parameters automatically set for pretty great results.  It also allows for manual operation of the settings, though I have yet to really adjust theses as my needs to not really call for it.  Setup for uploading to the computer was a snap and the performance of the upload was more than acceptable.  I was satisfied with the general picture quality, but the macro mode is phenominal.  It lets you get in as close as 1.9" away from the subject and get extremely detailed shots.  While testing the camera and getting familiar with the controls I used the macro mode to take a picture of my girlfriends broad stitched sweater.  When the picture came up on the LCD it revealed an extremely fine piece of hair on her shoulder. I was floored.  That alone made me satisfied with my purchase.  I wasn't at first as I ordered it online and went straight to the store to pick it up, so I never really saw it in person until I got it home.  When I opened the box I was shocked to see how small it actually was.  I had a hard time grasping something that small could cost $400+, but the picture quality and the features it packs, as well as the overall package compared to the competition helped me realize it is an exceptional value.
