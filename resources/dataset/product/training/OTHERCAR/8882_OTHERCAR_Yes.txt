            I have owned a 1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS-T for about a year now. It�s the 6th car I have owned in my 6 or 7 years of driving. All of my cars have been small sporty cars, ranging from a VW GTI to a BMW 325i Convertible. My Eclipse is by far the best all around sports car I have ever owned. Don�t misunderstand me, I enjoyed my BMW very much for the 4 months I had it, but it was a nightmare to maintain. 

<b>The Setup</b>

My Eclipse is a dark Green GS-T. This is the next model down from the most loaded model, the GSX. My Eclipse has every option the GSX has, minus the All Wheel Drive and the 17� wheels. Eclipse�s come in (in order from least amount of goodies to most) base, RS, GS, GS-T, and GSX trim lines. There are two convertible models available, the Spyder GS-T and Spyder GS. The GS-T and GSX are turbo models, and came with a raised rear spoiler that is unique amongst the Eclipses you will see on the road. Obviously this review will focus mostly on the GS-T. 

The GS-T (with it�s turbo) kicks out about 205 horses and about 210 Lb-Ft of torque. Combine that with a stock curb weight (manual transmission of course) of 2976 Lbs and you get a fast car. 

This car corners on rails. The fully independent front and rear suspension was well designed for hard driving. The GS-T comes stock with 205/55-16 tires and a ground clearance of 5.4 inches. I replaced my tires with 225/45-17 Good Year Eagle RS-A�s and lowered the car 2� to bring the ground clearance down to about 3.5 inches. I highly recommend the upgrade in tires/rims as the wider tire compliments the car�s awesome handling. The Good Year tires were great for this car, and I�ve had nothing but great experiences with them in the past. (I will probably put up a review at a future date on those)

As far as speed and overall performance, this car is exceptional. It doesn�t have the raw power of a 350 horsepower V-8 muscle car, but it�s more powerful and faster than most compact sports cars out there today, such as the Ford Probe, Honda Prelude, and the like. The 2.0 Liter turbo engine is smooth; it purrs like a cat at idle and screams like a bobcat at full throttle. The gearshift is smooth and has a fairly short throw and the clutch is fairly tight.

<b>Audio</b>

My GS-T came with a stock Infinity 6 speaker stereo system. The head unit has a CD Player and a cassette player and the unit itself is great. The speakers sound ok, but can blow easily, particularly if you live in an area where temperatures vary extremely (below 35 and above 85). 

The rear speakers are 6x9�s mounted to the left and right of the rear seat back. I myself am not a big fan of 6x9 speakers, but to make it worse there is very little mounting depth. When I went to replace the rear speakers with Infinity 6x9�s, there wasn�t enough space for the magnet. Mitsubishi�s stock rear 6x9 has an oddly-shaped tiny magnet that will fit in this space. Use caution when buying speakers for this car, as the size charts and guides will tell you that most 6x9�s will fit in the rear of this car when in fact there is very little mounting depth for typical aftermarket speakers. 

<b>Maintenance</b>

This is this car�s one weak point is in the maintenance. Having owned 3 Hondas (a CRX, Accord, and a Prelude) that are well known for their durability, my expectations may be somewhat high. The Eclipse seems like it�s not as solidly put together as it should be. Certain parts of the car come loose now and then. For example, the high mount brake light, which I had to completely tear apart, buy about $4 worth of replacement fasteners and then put back together. I have had one �major� maintenance problem with the car; the air conditioning compressor seized up, which cost around $1200 (!) to replace. 

All in all, I am very happy with this car and it�s been an absolute blast to own. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a slightly used sports car that will perform well and take to modifications easily. I would stay away from the base, RS, and GS models as they will not perform as well and have fewer options. Also, these cars can�t handle high mileage the way some other cars (i.e. Hondas) can, so keep that in mind if you decide to buy one.
