            We bought a 1997 Dodge 3500 dooley brand new, 2 years ago.
Absolutely love the handling of the truck, pickup is very slow.
at 900 miles the transmission went out.  At 9000 miles the transmission went out.  At 12000 miles the transmission went out.  This was our number one truck in a very busy business.  Thank goodness we had other trucks to use or could have lost alot of business.  We feel the design of the truck is great...It is a sharp vehicle!  Looking into Lemon Law right now as truck has been nothing but a piece of junk since day one.  (coil went out 2 weeks ago...truck only has 12000 miles on it!)Will never buy Dodge again!<br><br>
