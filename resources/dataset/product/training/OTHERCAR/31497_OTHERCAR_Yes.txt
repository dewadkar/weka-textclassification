            This is a review of the 1996 Nissan Sentra. I wrote it before different years were put into different sections, and it was automatically put in the 2000 Sentra section.


I agree, this is a great car; but it is not very good looking. If you can deal with the lack of style, I would definitely buy this car. I have been driving this car for about a 9 months, and have few problems. This car has a good engine, but from what I have heard, works much better with a stick-shift. When I am driving in the city with my automatic, I have to keep overdrive off (overdrive will allow the car to shift to 4th gear) because the car always tries to shift up. Even at 45 mph, with overdrive on, the car will try to shift up. I have found that the 4th gear is only necessary at about 55 mph. If you are driving up a hill with 4th gear, the car will seem underpowered. On the highway, the 4th gear is stunning! It is possible to get to 65 or 70 mph with no loud engine noise. The car doesn't even seem to be stressing. This is partially because of the variable valve timing engine. If you are at a stoplight on the highway and the car shifts from 3rd to 4th gear, you suddenly hear the engine get much quieter. 

The interior is very functional. There is a large panel between the seats with rotary climate controls, and an easy to use AM/FM/Cassette radio. The controls are high enough to reach without stretching, and do not require much thinking to figure out. The seats are also a class act. They are wide, and hold you in them, not carry you on top, like other cars. They have headrests which, if you lean your head against them, will keep you looking forward. The interior of this car feels very comfortable, and very right. I could drive in it for hours and still feel okay. The vision of this car is also excellent. From the interior you can see everything. The windshield is very large giving you a feeling of space, and allowing you to see the front of the car, and making you feel safer. 

This large windshield gives the car a peculiar look from the outside. The windshield and the duckbill-like front make it seem a little too aerodynamic. The back seat is large, but because of rear windshield, it is possible to knock your head on the glass. 

The only major problem with this car was when we had to replace the alternator. One other warning: when we took the Sentra in for scheduled maintenance, the dealer did more work than was listed in our owner's manual. Our dealer had a different list of maintenance, published by some outside company. So, when you take your Sentra in, make sure you know exactly what work you want to be done.

Overall, this is a great little car. It is sturdy, reliable, and fun to drive. If you need a low-price car to last you for a long time, the Nissan Sentra deserves your attention.<br><br>
