             I myself prefer a two door auto but if I was interested in buying a four door a Caprice Classic would be my first choice.

When I drove this auto I found that it drove so smooth you barely feel those potholes that have been there for years. This cars engine is a V-8 with superior pickup. The exterior is very well built.

The interior is very roomy, comfy and absolutely made for tall people.
The front seat even has a seat belt in the middle,allowing this awesome car to seat six. Carrying large items in the trunk would be no problem with its spacious capacity.

I know two people (brother and Dad)who own this fabulous auto and haven't had any repairs done besides regular maintenance. They both own the 1994 model and both have over 100,000 miles.


If you are looking for a spacious, fast four door durable auto this is the auto for you.
