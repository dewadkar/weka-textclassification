            After I was in a car accident that totaled my previous car, I bought a 1996 Toyota Corolla DX.  It's a year older than my other car, but I love this one even more.  The Toyota quality is amazing, and I've decided that when it comes time to get another car, I'll look at Toyotas first.

The ride is very good for this range of car.  The overdrive is outstanding, and it's great for when you need to accelerate quickly.  I have an automatic, and it drives beautifully.  It's a little noisy, but overall it's a good car to drive.

The interior and the trunk are very spacious, but tall people probably want to sit in the front seat.  The rear seats fold down for access to the trunk, and the trunk is very roomy.  The driver's seat has great back support and is very comfortable.

The controls are easy to use, and the console is angled toward the driver, making it easy to make adjustments to air, radio, etc.  The air conditioner is excellent, quickly cooling the car even in the middle of hot Texas summers.  I only wish that the wipers had a &quot;Mist&quot; level.  One of the nice things is that the clock is separate from the radio.  The factory radio/cassette player was great, and the sound in the car is good.  

I'm a college student who also works full-time, and this car is great for toting around all of my books and my briefcase, laptop, etc., with plenty of room.  I've also managed to get both of my cats in their carriers, a large litterbox, and their food in the car for a trip ... and that's saying something!<br><br>
