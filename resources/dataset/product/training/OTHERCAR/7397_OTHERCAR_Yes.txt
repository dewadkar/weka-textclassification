            I have read all the professional and amateur reviews on the Subaru Imprezza WRX I could find, and 99% of them raved about the car being the greatest thing since sliced bread.  So, naturally I could not wait to finally test drive one, and to be frank, I was not impressed. Sometimes reality cannot match the hype.  
I drove two seperate WRX sedans in the course of a day and  after months of dreaming about this car, I came to the hard realization that this car, while outstanding on paper simply in my opinion did not live up to it's potential and was not going to be the car I spend my hard earned money on.  
I have owned a turbo-charged car before(89 Ford Probe GT). It had the same size engine, minus DOHC, 16 values, intercooler, among other things.  The car was an absolute blast to drive on the highway at high speeds where the engine was high in the RPM band. The WRX gives me the same impression.  When driving in stop and go traffic, the car is an absolute dog.  It has simply econo car power until you get in the higher RPMs.  Even then though I didn't feel the rocket like power I so often read about.  
Another complain I have with the car is it's limp clutch.  The clutch is as limp as a wet noodle.  I prefer a clutch that offers some resistance at least.  This one practically goes to the floor on it's own.  It just feels weak!
The AWD impressed with it's ability to offer straight takeoffs, without any of the awful torque-steer so many front-wheelers have. But unless you drive like a banshee in the rain, or live in the part of the country that it does rain alot, I really don't find it too useful, or being of any real value.  
I was happy with the car's interior for the most part.  Nice stereo, seats, steering wheel.  A little too much on the dark side though.
I am glad that the dealers are dropping the prices on the WRX's.  One of the dealers I went to in Austin, can't get rid of them fast enough.  They currently have about 20 of them on their lot, and were really willing to offer me some fantastic payments.  I eventually had to tell them that this just wasn't the car for me.
