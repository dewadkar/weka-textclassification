            We purchased a new 2002 Honda Civic LX and have had nothing but luck with it so far.  This is my second Civic and I should clarify that my previous Civic was an Si and thus had a harder time getting adjusted to the Sedan Civic.

Very important pluses:
1) Fuel efficiency, we drive a lot and do not have to worry about the price of gas.
2) Roomier than any other car in its class for both passengers and cargo (I'm 5'11" and my wife is 5'1").  We tried all the usual suspects when buying our car including the Corolla, Protege, Focus, Sunfire/Cavalier, Elantra etc, most cars in its class and found that this one by far fit me the best.
3) Reliability, like I said, I've owned Civics for a long time with no realibility issues what-so-ever.
4) Although some people complain about the cabin noise, we found it a lot better than other cars in its class and better than our previous Civic.
4) All in all a great car and great re-sale value

Definite minuses:
1) Dealership experience, have talked to multiple people who had terrible experiences at their Honda dealerships.  They figure that the cars sell themselves so I don't think they try as hard.
2) The new Gen of Civics is larger but not as well built. The material feels cheaper and they eliminated the v-tech option on 4 door sedans (in Canada anyway)
3) Handling, brakes, and TIRES.  I believe that the suspension changed on this gen of civics (according to Consumer Reports) and has affected the handling quite a bit and it is noticeable.  The brakes are very soft like other people have mentioned.  The Firestone tires that come from the factory are terrible in winter conditions, the Dunlops that came with my last civic were much better and the Michelin X-one's I put on them were excellent.

All in all, we love the car and it is serving us extremely well through a move and a new baby (infant seats fit in great).
