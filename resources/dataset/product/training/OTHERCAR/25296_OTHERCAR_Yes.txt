            I've had the Coolpix 700 for about 3 months now.  Overall, I'm very happy with it. Most importantly, it is a great deal to get a 2-million pixel CCD that allows photographs of up to 1600x1200 pixels for the price.
Of course optical zoom would have been better than digital zoom.  I rarely use the digital zoom feature since it gives no extra resolution.  Instead of using digital zoom, I use Adobe Photoshop to zoom and crop.  

There are many manual adjustments.  There is a light metering feature for metering on the center of the shot or the edges, etc.  There is a best-shot selection function that takes up to 10 successive shots while the shutter-release button is held down, and selects the photo with the highest level of detail.

Like other digicams, you probably want to buy nickel-hydride batteries and a recharger, a compact-flash card reader to transfer data to your computer faster, and a larger compact-flash card. 

One gripe: the shutter-release button has a poor feel to it.  Often I have to press the button very hard and long to feel confident I've taken a shot.  Takes getting used to.<br><br>
