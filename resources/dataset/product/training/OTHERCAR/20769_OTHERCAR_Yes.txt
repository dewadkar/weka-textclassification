            Having owned several Hondas (and 3 CRXs) this is the best car Honda has ever made. I've had '85, '89, and 90' SI models and each had over 150k miles put on them, very reliable cars. I'll discuss the '90 model here.

25-30 MPG, decent acceleration, good handling, and still looks good 10 years later (but hey, it doesn't turn heads either). The CRX has great front leg room and the interior isn't too bad once you consider the car is probably at least 10 years old. Go with the 5 speed as Honda had at this point yet to make a decent automatic. This car has the perfect combination of quickness, maneuverability, and dirt cheap operational cost to make it the perfect city-commuter car.

My complaints: Still somewhat hard to see directly behind you, even with the 2nd Gen.'s glass rear hatch plate. Pedal feel is typical Honda, as is the shifter, which isn't bad, but isn't great. After 100k miles you can expect to replace the A/C in hot climates. Parts and repairs are somewhat pricey, although its an easy car to work on yourself.

Finally, if your in an accident, unless its with a Geo Metro or Ford Fiesta... You'll lose.<br><br>
