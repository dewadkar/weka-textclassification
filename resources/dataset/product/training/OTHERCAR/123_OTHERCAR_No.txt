            I started a thorough search for a digital camera several months ago.  I was not looking for the best digital camera available in the market but was willing to spend less than 300 dollars for the best camera I could get for that range.  I finally decided on the Fujifilm mx-1200 simply  because for the price it appeared to offer the most.  

Some features that this camera offers that I could not find packaged all together in one camera is several choices of flash modes.  There are night modes, red eye reduction (which does not work on cats in case you are wondering!) and turns off as well.  Some cameras in this range do not even offer a type of flash at all.  Other neat features include the LCD display which is very nice.  Also the menus are very easy to use and easy to understand at just a glance.  The camera is also somewhat small (larger than say the canon powershot) and still pocketsize.  That was a very important camera &quot;quality&quot; for me. In addition, the camera also offers 2X digital zoom.  

What I love about the camera is that it takes great pictures.  For the price I could not have asked for anything more.  It can take the equivalent of an 8 X 10 no problems.  The camera also offers three different types of pictures (which very compression) allowing you to store more pictures than I originally thought without compromising too much quality.  

The things that I do not like about the product is that there are many additions that I had to/want to get to make my experience with it perfect. 

Products I recommend that you need to get if you purchase the camera are:
-carrying case ($5)
-AC adapter ($30)
-USB Smartmedia card reader ($30-40)
-Larger smart media card (16 MB - $30)
-Rechargeable NiMh Batteries with Charger

The reason for the AC adapter besides the obvious fact that it does not come with one is that when you are uploading the pictures if your camera runs out of power running on the 4AA batteries the files may become corrupt/lost etc.  However if you go ahead and purchase the USB Smartmedia card reader than the AC adapter may not be necessary.  The USB reader is nice because the connection that comes with the camera uses the SLOW SLOW SLOW serial port.  I originally thought that the slow speed of uploading the pictures was not going to bother me but I did not realize HOW SLOW IT WAS!  The purchase of the USB Smartmedia card reader totally eliminated that problem and eliminates the worry of your batteries running out during uploading since the reader only reads the card.  OF course the batteries are a must since using the LCD often drains the batteries quickly.  I used the camera for two days at varying times, playing around with all the features and had to change the batteries after those two days.  

OVerall VERY pleased with the price and quality of the pictures.  After all that is all that matters in the end!<br><br>
