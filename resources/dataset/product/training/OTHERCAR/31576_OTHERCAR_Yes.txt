            April 3, 2001 - The Nikon coolpix 800 was a great digital camera.  I have had a very good experience owning one because it produces great pictures, but mostly because it was downright bargain when I purchased it.  I made my purchase back in July 2000 at an exceptional price of $325 ($400 less $75 factory rebate).  

Even in today's market of April 2001, this would still be a good buy, but there are a large number of other digital cameras 

that do as good a job as the Nikon Coolpix 800, if not better.  Anyone who is contemplating purchasing a Coolpix 800 should 

realize that this nearly a 2 year old camera (introduced in Sept. 1999) and represents old technolgy.  But this can also work 

in the your favor as a consumer.  The product is at the end of its retail cycle, and there are plenty of retailers who will 

soon be willing to move this camera at bargain basement price.  Nikon has replaced the Coolpix 800 with the Coolpix 880, which is 3.34 megapixel camera, occupying the same $599 price slot previously held by the Coolpix 800.  

Nikon is once again offering a $75 rebate on this model, good through April 2001, and I would think the retailers have no choice but to get rid of their stock as soon as they can before obsolescence renders the cameras completely unsellable.  I would think a rebate adjusted price in the $250-$300 makes it a must buy purchase.  At that price point, you simply cannot find another 2.11 megapixel camera.  The only closest competitor is the Kodak DC280, another excellent, but discontinued model, which is selling between $350 to $450.  

It takes superb pictures, due to the aforementioned high resolution CCD.  The automatic exposures in daylight are fantastic, with great exposure, but the camera has some problems metering in the automatic mode indoors.  I have found I get my best results using manual.  

The zoom works fine in daylight, but in flash photography, but when the zoom is in wide angle mode, the spread of the flash drops off on the corners of the pictures.

The Coolpix has a rangefinder and an LCD viewfinder, albeit a small 1.8 inch screen.  Some cameras don't offer the rangefinder.  Battery life is terrible and it is easy to wear down 4 alkaline batteries after about 80 flash shots.  I purchased the Nikon battery pack for $79 which includes an external belt clip battery which provides enough juice to substitute for about 3 to 4 sets of alkalines.  

One nice feature about the Nikon Coolpix series is that the Nikkor lenses will accept a 28mm screw on filter.  Nikon offers a 4 filter set containing one (1) UV, two (2) neutral densities, and one (1) circular polarizing filter, all for about $70.  It's not a bad deal.  Getting a filter is a good thing to do, since the darn unattached lens cap keeps falling off.  

The camera lacks a USB port, so downloading pictures is limited to either using the serial cable (forget it) or using a USB compact flash reader (preferred).  The compact flash reader was dirt cheap at $15.00 at local computer swap meet where I also found a Simple Technology 128 MB CF card for the paltry sum of $109.00.  That was in July 2000, so I'm sure the price on this card is even less.  Obviously the card will hold 128 one-meg super high resolution shots.  That's more than enough storage for my use.

There are other good and bad points regarding the Coolpix 800, and most are covered in detail in the other Epinions.  My point here is that price plays an important part in determining the camera's value.  At $525, the camera is only average when compared to other expensive units because it is an end of cycle product.  But if it could be found for less than $300, then it could be a fantastic buy because of it's resolution.  The same holds true for the Kodak DC280.  Both are excellent cameras when purchased at discounted prices.

My recommendation is to use all the price comparison pages on the internet, such as the one found here and on ZDnet.  Look for Nikon to continue the rebate (found on their website at www.nikonusa.com) until this model is gone.  

If you don't have a digital camera now , and are looking to buy a low cost entry level camera, this might be the way to go.  If you have already have a digital camera and are looking to upgrade to the latest that technology has to offer, it's best to look at another model - like the Coolpix 880, which represents Nikon's newest technology.
