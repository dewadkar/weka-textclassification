            Remember when the only people who drove Devilles were grandparents?  Well look behind the tinted windows of the 2001 Deville and chances are you'll see an on-the-go Baby Boomer enjoying performance and luxury.  When I started to debate the new car issue, I test drove a Cadillac as a lark.  After all wasn't this the car my Mom drove?  Yes and no.  The name's the same and the luxury is a huge part of this automobile.  The 2001 Deville ends its resemblance to its pre-2000 brothers there.  This car no longer lofts.  Say what you will General Motors...Cadi's used to bounce ever so softly down the highway.  That experience is long gone.  Acceleration is FUN....no torque steer (so common with front wheel drive) and adequate get-up-and-go from any speed.  Handling is fun, too, with a nice amount of road feel and a crispness that's also new.  And this from a standard 275hp Deville.  For those who need a little more sport, there's the 300hp DTS with 17&quot; wheels and a tighter suspension.  For my driving habits and automobile needs, I chose the Deville.  Cadillac has a full array of goodies you can add to this car.  I chose the Comfort and Convenience package (memory seats, lumbar, heated seats) and Leather Upholstery. It comes with AM/FM Stereo/Cassette/CD Radio standard.  I truly had not planned on purchasing this car, however the ride and drive are exceptional and the many features rival cars with far higher MSRP's.I think my favorite thing about owning this car is watching people's expressions as they realize its a Cadillac and my least favorite thing about owning this car is listening to people say &quot;Well, it looks like a Mercedes in the front.&quot;  Yeah, sure!    <br><br>
