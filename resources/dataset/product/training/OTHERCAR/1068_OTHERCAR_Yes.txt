            I have to say i have never seen so many people so happy with their purchase of a cherokee.  i own a '90 cherokee and my father just bought a new '98 grand cherokee.  We have never had any problems with our vehicles.  The grand cherokee is a great vehicle.  It has the 4wd capability to get where you want despite almost all terrain.  this isnt just an off road vehicle it has the power and acceleration to fit almost anyones needs, i mean what a great combination V8 magnum and 4.0 liters.  If that isn't enough the limited version of the grand cherokee comes in a 5.2L.  If you only buy a jeep for one reason buy it because jeep vehicles are some of the most reliable and dependable vehicles out there.  My cherokee is 10 years old and i have never had a problem with it, mechanically that is.  the only problem i have had is that after about 4 or 5 years the paint wore down to the primer on the hood and roof.  it seems that jeep has fixed this problem i have not seen many jeeps form the past 5 or 6 years with paint problems.  Overall i recomend a grand cherokee or any other jeep for that matter to everyone.<br><br>
