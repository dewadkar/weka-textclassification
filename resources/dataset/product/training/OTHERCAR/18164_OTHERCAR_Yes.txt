            My Dad's Rams have been the talk of the family.  He first decided to get one three years ago.  It was a '98 and we all fell in love with it.  Now that he traded it in we love the new one even more.  With a smooth ride yet heavy duty feel it is easily handled by men and women of all heights.  With a roomy front seat and available back seat, it can be a family truck.  It even has room for a carseat in the middle!  It also has features like a key to turn off the airbag and a handle to pull yourself into the passenger side.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a multipurpose vehicle.  It's like an SUV with a bed.  It's perfect for a man who wants a truck but needs someplace to put the extra people.  The front seat is roomy and it is comfortable on long trips.  However, with an extended cab I wouldn't recommend putting anybody tall in the back seat for extended amounts of time.  The leg room can be tight.  Overall I would say it is a great investment in a vehicle you won't regret.
