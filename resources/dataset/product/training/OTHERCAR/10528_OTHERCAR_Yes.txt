            I am 19 years old and I love my Acura 3.2TL, lot of my parents friends think it is weird that I own an Acura 3.2TL and not an integra or prelude or something in those classes which most people my age drive, but I totaly enjoy my car. I just wish I could find more sites that have performance parts for my car. 
If you know of any sites that I can go to, to find accessories for my car please let me know. I definitely recommend buying the Acrua 3.2TL no matter what age you are, I am sure any one will find the car smooth and very powerful at the same time. Small upgrade from the Accord coupe V6 EX, but a lot more features.
