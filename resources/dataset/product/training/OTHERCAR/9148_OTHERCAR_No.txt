            Mine is a 1990 Excel GS. I bought in 1994 for $2650. The car had been garaged since purchased new by the guy I bought it from. The body and interior were in close to like new condition and it only had 45,500 miles on the odometer.

During a fairly extensive test drive which included some freeway miles, the car stalled a couple of times at low speed or idle. I didn't buy it immediately, but later decided it probably just needed a tune up, so I called the guy back the next day and purchased the car.

That was a mistake. I don't recall when it first happened, but I was on the freeway in the number one lane cruising at 60 or so when the engine went dead. A scary situation, but this had happened to me once before in an old American car, so I didn't totally panic. I pushed the clutch in and was able to restart the engine. (I later learned to simply turn the ignition key off, the back on.) It didn't just die at high speed; it could happen at any speed, actually. Sometimes it was almost impossible to start, but when it did, started and ran normally.

I've had some experience with tune ups, so I replaced the plugs. The dying on the freeway scenario had happened several times and I noticed the problem only occurred when the car wasn't fully warmed up, so I also replaced a coolant temperature sensing device. I inspected the thermostat and found it to be stuck in the open position, so I replaced it too. I felt hopeful.

I was disappointed. The problem continued. I won't bore you with all of my attempts to correct the problem, but there were many and the expenses climbed. Things got so bad at one point, I took it to a Hyundai dealer. After a brief inspection, they advised replacing the electronic throttle control mechanism. I let them do that. Another $400 down the drain. The car was the same. I complained, so they did more testing, including substituting a different computer. They concluded I needed a new computer for $800. I declined. 

Strangely, the car began to be more reliable. Not perfect, but since that little exercise by the Hyundai people, the car almost never dies at speed.
I guess disconnecting and reconnecting the computer might have improved the electrical contact. I don't really know.

The car has almost 84,000 miles on it now. Other than the above problem, it's been pretty reliable. I like the appearance, and even though I'm 6'4&quot; tall, I fit inside it pretty well. It gets good mileage.

I don't think anybody would buy if from me for any price I'd be willing to accept if I told them the truth about it. Unlike the guy who sold it to me, I'm not too keen on lying, so until my financial fortunes improve significantly or it totally dies, I'll continue driving it.
