            I am leasing (3 year) a 1998 Jetta GLS - I got the sunroof and winter package, living in Seattle, I thought this was appropriate. The sunroof for 9 days out of the year, and the heated mirrors and seats for the remaining 356 days. I looked at Honda, Toyota, even Jeeps, and nothing compared to the Jetta. They don't call it German engineering for nothing.  My requirements for my car search were, in no particular order, (and still are), 1) Handling, 2) Leg and head room, 3) Acceleration, 4) something that doesn't look like a hyundai or have a name like seabreaze, and 5) something that was going to last and perform.  First of all handling, in my opinion, a car should be highly responsive to the wheel - I have driven enough old man cars that feel like the steering wheel is only partially connected to the shaft.  In the Jetta's case, you feel like racing indy style behind the wheel. I was very impressed.  Leg and head room - there was no other car that even came close. VW is well known for spaciousness and the Jetta is no exception (one caveat is that the new models - 99s and above - are a bit smaller, both in head room, leg room and truck space).  I'm 6'4&quot; and I have plenty of headroom, even with the lowered ceiling from the sunroof.  As for leg room, if I put the seat in the far back position, I cannot push any of the pedals to the floor.  That's also pretty impressive.  With acceleration, my manual transmission hasn't failed me yet.  Now my opinion might be skewed since my previous car was a peugeot, but the Jetta has got some getup to it.  The body shape ain't bad either - at least it doesn't look like every other car, and especially those new bubble cars which I don't know who lost a bet to make those things.  Lastly, as far as performance and reliability, the only thing that has broken in the two years I've had it, is the driver side window, which sometimes would come back down after closing the window (auto-windows).  This problem is evidently well known, and the cause seems to be that the mechanism is wound too tightly - took two minutes for the shop to fix it.  Lastly, I would suggest taking a look at the leases - I was vehemently opposed when I first starting looking, but it actually gave me a better car than I can afford, and, if I decide to buy it at the end of the lease, it will have only cost me a few hundred dollars extra. And I don't have to worry about the time it takes to sell it when I'm ready to sell.  My advise, for what it's worth: Go Jetta.  Oh, and if you come across a dealer who is not kissing your butt the entire time, go somewhere else, it will make your experience all that much better. <br><br>
