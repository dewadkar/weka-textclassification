   I would like to know if anybody else has a problem with the deluxe leather bucket seats?
 The problem being the lumbar has got a metal bar on either side of the back side of the seat which you can feel with your back in its most relaxed position, when the lumber bars are compressed to a tighter fit they are intolerable-not just uncomfortable. You can feel these bars with your bare hands by just lightly pressing down on the back seat,half way up the back into the wings a bit. Cannot live with this and G.M. is not getting back to me. This is my 8th new suburban.
  I did like the tailgate rather than lift gate, the lift gate requires a smaller back window which I like to view as much as possible. Also enjoyed the 42 gallon tank over the 32 gallon.  Mike<br><br>
