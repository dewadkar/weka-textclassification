            I have owned my 1998 Isuzu Hombre for three years now and I would call it a very average truck in performance but nice in appearance.  Mine is silver with metallic stripes,  and it looks sharp on the road.  The interior is nice with a multi-purpose storage console in the center.

The major mechanical problem that I have had with the truck is that the transmission had to be replaced at 30,000 miles.  Additional work had to be done on the replacement transmission a few thousand later.  Maybe a bad batch of Japanese transmissions?  

The truck is sluggish on the road and can barely move when the A/C is turned on.  Forget about uphill pulls.  Also,  don't try to haul more than a light load in the back.

If you like the Chevy S-10, then you will love this truck, because it is the same vehicle with the Isuzu name on it.<br><br>
