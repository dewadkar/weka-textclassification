            BMW is following the old U.S. automaker ``bigger-is-better'' approach by making its entry 3-Series cars larger and roomier.

The 1999 3-Series sedan is slightly longer, wider and taller. And a moderately longer wheelbase (distance between front and rear axles) allows more room in the backseat. At long last BMW offers a 3-Series model with decent rear room for two 6-footers.

The new sedan looks more substantial. It has a slicker new body with a radical snub-nose profile. There are minuscule front and rear body overhangs and the sheetmetal has a tightly stretched look now that the track (distance between wheels on the same axle) has been widened both at the front and rear.

This BMW also offers better engine response and is quieter and more refined--and more Americanized. Rough edges have been smoothed to make it more appealing to U.S. buyers of upscale cars, and you can get up to eight air bags.

The BMW sedan always has felt solid, but the structure of the new sedan is said to be 50 percent stiffer. The car remains plenty sporty, although some may feel it's too smooth and refined. But it was due for a change because its predecessor made its debut as a 1992 model.

The 1999 sedan is the first in a line of revamped 3-Series models. Its arrival may confuse folks because BMW is slowly phasing in other redone 3-Series cars.

Here is how it will work: The new 3-Series coupe won't get the 1999 3-Series sedan's new design for about a year. And the 3-Series convertible doesn't get the design for 18 months. Two years away are a station wagon and high-performance ``M'' versions of the new 3-Series.

The new sedan comes as the $26,400 323i and $33,400 328i. The engine constitutes the major difference between the two. The 323i has a 2.5-liter six-cylinder that generates 170 horsepower. The 328i has a 2.8-liter six that produces 193 horsepower.

Both engines are evolved from the inline six-cylinder motors in 1998 323/328 models but have items such as a new aluminum cylinder block and enhanced torque in the low- to medium r.p.m. range for better response during typical U.S. driving.

Both models weigh about 3,200 pounds, so the 328i is faster--doing 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 6.6 seconds with the standard five-speed manual transmission. But the 323i is far from slow, hitting 60 in 7.1 seconds. Both engines provide an estimated 20 m.p.g. in the city and 29 on highways.

Also offered for the first time on a 3-Series sedan is a $1,200 five-speed automatic transmission, which slows acceleration a bit and slightly reduces fuel economy.

Stability is enhanced by a standard traction control system and a Cornering Brake Control system, which helps keep the new sedan from spinning if a driver applies brakes too hard in a curve.

As for safety, one can get $385 backseat side-impact air bags to accompany standard dash-mounted air bags and side-impact airbags in the front-seat area.

Precise, linear steering and a nicely designed, supple all-independent suspension give the new sedan a good ride and excellent handling. Braking also is impressive.

The manual transmission shifter is slightly notchy, as it is in all BMW models, and works with a smooth but excessively long-throw clutch. It's easy if in a hurry to accidentally shift from second to fifth gear, instead of from second to third--and thus be in too high a gear for decent engine response at lower speeds.

Those with long fingernails will wish that the console-mounted power window switches had a more user-friendly design. But other controls have a conveniently high placement and more user-friendly design. Front seats are comfortable on long drives.

The long exterior door handles are easily grasped, and the trunk is impressively roomy, with a low opening for quick loading.

BMW couldn't afford to botch the design of the new 3-Series because that is its best-seller in the U.S. market. Well, it didn't, and BMW feels the new design will be competitive at least for the next six years.
