            I bought my brand new Mitsubishi Montero Sport LS two years ago. So, I think I have enough information now to make a clear judgment about this vehicle
 First, my Montero has little over 60 000 miles now, and have been in shop only 7 times only, and one visit was safety recall, so I do not count this visit against car dependability. Moreover, 2 calls were related to computer problems (Airbag control unit). Rests were minor problems with interior. All the problems were covered by warranty, which 3-years/36000 miles bumper-to-bumper and 5/60000 power train. So, I can honestly tell, that overall I did not had any big mechanical problems. 
 Second, one thing against Montero Sport it is a tires. First set of tires (right from a factory), Yacohama Digger, was defected, bulged to be exact, and was replaced by Sears in three days. Even though, tires were replaced they are still of poor quality (wet traction is horrible.) So after about 25 000 miles I have switched to Dunlop Tires, which are much better. However, I think on 2000 model Mitsubishi is using Bridgestone.
  Last but not least, is quality of the ride. I have only one thing to tell interior is the quietest of many including Toyota 4Runner, and Jeep Grand Cherokee. 6 speakers Infiniti sound with CD player provide crisp sound with enough bass even for a teen. So over all I was one happy customer, and as matter of the fact I am looking for new one at the end of the year.
