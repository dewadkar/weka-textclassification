            I bought a 95 Galant S Auto from CarMax for $11 K including all taxes/fees with 43 K miles.

Its 3 years later with 55 K miles and I've had no major problems.
That's 12 K miles in 3 years or 4,000 miles/year.

A fuse blew that caused the indicator to blink at double its normal rate and cost about $20 to repair.

The front brake pads were replaced for $150.
The timing belt was replaced for $100.
The throttle body was cleaned for $150.
The battery was replaced for $55.
Total costs = $475
excluding gas, oil changes, insurance, etc.

There is a small jerk in the transmission if you punch the gas (from a standstill) which I'm told is a feature of many 4 cyl engines.
i.e., if you drive a V6 version, you probably will not notice it as much.

I do all regular maintenance on the car.
I had max window tinting put on it for about $250.
Its a decent family car (small families).
I upgraded from a 91 Toyota Tercel DX coupe so its a big difference going from a sub-compact coupe to a mid-size sedan.

Its 2.4 L 140 hp engine is quiet on the hwy upto a cruising speed of about 65 - 75 mph.
You begin to feel a small loss of control in the steering over 75 mph (so don't drive it over 75!). The max I've taken it is about 85 mph.

The overdrive (fourth gear) is useful in stop & go traffic since you don't have to use the brake as much.
Taking your foot off the gas when going downhill causes the transmission to shift to keep the car in control which is a great feature for all automatics.

I've had a couple of fender benders with other comparable cars (Ford Taurus) with mine always sustaining less damage.
I've been satisfied with the car but plan to sell it in a few months so I can upgrade to an SUV.

I needed a bigger sedan for about $10 K and this seemed the best available at the time.

This model is rated AVERAGE reliability by Consumer Reports though I've had fewer problems with it than our other car - a 96 Infiniti G20 rated VERY reliable.

The resale value and demand for this car seems to be below average. It took me a full year to sell it privately for $5,500 so it depreciated by 50% in 3 years.

The current economic climate was very bad for selling cars also.

I should have taken up CarMax at their offer of $5,000 a year ago. I would have saved on insurance ($500), advertising ($250), and repairs ($250).
