            I shopped around alot for a camera before picking this one... my goal was to get 3 megapixels with optical zoom and spend as little money as possible. when i came across the 3340z i couldnt help but think it was too good to be true, but it was just too tempting to resist. heres what i found

Construction: the camera itself is made out of cheap grey plastic with a thin metallic coating that im sure would start to rub off on the corners within a matter of days (i used to have a watch made out of the same stuff when i was a kid). the LCD is unusable in any low light situation, its just pure black. The zoom is controlled with the tiny joystick that is used to navegate the options menu, not only is it small but since the join stick moves 360 degrees, it often wont zoom because your not exactly to the left or right. zooming in and out is a lengthy operation that is accompanied by flickering on the LCD, and the loud grinding of gears that sound ready to brake at any moment. 

Picture Options: while the menu has plenty of options and is relatively straight forward, it "forgets" what setting you had when you turn it on, so your stuck using the battery draining LCD and changing options before taking every picture. point and shoot, unless the default setting is the one you wanted, is an imposibility. another thing that really bugged me was that in night landscape mode the camera uses flash by default. if you try and turn off the flash after changing into night mode that camera goes back to default, except the flash will be off. if you want to take night pics with no flash, you must turn off the flash before switching modes. to make things worse, the nightscape logo takes the place of the flash/noflash logo, so if you dont remember if you turned the flash off or not your out of luck.

Picture Quality: now i'm not a camera guy; in fact, this is the first camera of any type that ive ever purchased. so i dont pretend to be an expert on picture quality. that being said, im not blind, and the only word i can think of to describe the quality of the pictures taken with this camera is "unacceptable". to be fair, its very possible that my particular camera was defective. there were about 20 or so white dots randomly spread (though always in the same position) over every picture. they are small enough so that you cant really tell in lighter backgrounds, but when you take a night shot its painfully obvious. i thought maybe the lense was dirty (even though id just taken it out of the box) but it was crystal clean.... i dont know, maybe there was some dirt inside the lense itself. well, even if the white dots are only on my camera, the quality still was much lower than a friend of mine's 3MP camera (a sony cybershot that costed about twice as much as the concord). 

Conclusion: theres probably alot more wrong with these things than just what i mentioned.... i played with it for about 4 hours before putting it back in the box so that i could mail it back to tigerdirect. so i wouldnt be surprised if what ive described is just the tip of the iceberg. personly, i decided to go with the minolta s414 instead. you might want to check it out if quality as well as lots of features for little money is important to you.
