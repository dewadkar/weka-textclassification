            If you really want to pick the right Vette, here's how to do it.  I just recently took a trip to Bowling Green, KY to the Corvette plant and museum.  I work at a Chevrolet dealership and get to see the Corvette on a regular basis.  Yeah, I've looked through the brochures, dreamed about color, top and interior combinations.  But the difficult thing is that you would never dream that colors would make such a statement, or that the top choice would change the looks of a car so much.  Corvette enthusiasts, you're saying, I know what a difference they make!  I own one, I've been to all the car shows.  I know what I like.  Well, so did I.

My father in law works on the assembly line at the Vette plant, so we got a personal tour.  But it was just what the regular tour see's.  The neat thing about the tour was the quality that you see going into each car.  These people really take the Vette image to heart. Each car is handled like an individual egg.  Pampered with each part that is assembled to the chassis.  All nationalities of Corvette's are assembled on the same line.  Meaning that you will see an American version beside a European or Japanese version.  The differences are obviously the orientation of the drivers column, but the lights make each model recognizable.  Alot of Vette owners enjoy spicing up there unit with foreign lighting kits and this lets you see what you will be doing.

Another important factor in ordering or purchasing your Vette is the selection of wheels.  The stock standard wheel looks good with all colors.  The high polished wheels look better with certain colors, especially the dark ones.  My personal favorite color wheel combo was the Bowling Green Metalic with the high polished wheels.  The Bowling Green looks black until the light hits it just right, and then WOW!  The last wheel selection, and the most expensive, is the Magnesiun wheel option.  They look kind of gold, so they aren't the best selection with all of the available colors.  They just have to strike you in my opinion.

Just in case you didn't know, Cadillac is coming back out with a Vette hybrid.  ( Remember the Cadillac Allante? )  I saw about 20 of these coming off the line.  They all come off the line painted Diamond White, but the body panels are not permanently attached to the chassis.  These units are shipped to another factory and those panels will be destroyed!  Believe you me, one of these beauties won't make it to the Cadillac factory and will show up in the Vette museum eventually.

The coolest vette of the day was the purple vette.  Trust me, it was purple.  The only purple factory vette with metallic silver dual racing stripes.  Every option known to man on this baby.  It was 25 minutes from the end of the line.  The underneath of the hood has been signed by every worker in the factory, and was later given away in a lottery drawing to a factory employee.  The only hitch from GM, was that it had to spend its' first year of ownership in the museum.  Really cool, go see it!

The bottom line is that if you are really serious about choosing your perfect color combination go to the factory and see them all.  After seeing the factory go to the Museum and check out the only ZR-12 in existence.<br><br>
