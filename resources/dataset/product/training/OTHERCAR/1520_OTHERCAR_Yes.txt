                   I bought this car, an SL1 with four cylinders, in 1996 because of the need for fuel economy and safety.  I drove a 40 mile round trip each day while I worked.  I was pleased to find this car got 40 miles to the gallon, far above my expectations.  It has a lot of pep, climbing grades like a sporty car.  It crawls on top of Colorado's winter snows and stops safely in foul weather of any kind.  The finish is easy to maintain.  Just dish soap will make it shine like new.
       Service is always courteous and it never goes in cost above the original estimate.  The service people are also quick to repair any of their mistakes at no cost to the consumer.  In one incident someone failed to put the oil cap on tight enough so the engine seized.  I got a rental car and a new engine free.
       My only gripe is the panels on the center divider between the passenger's feet and the driver's feet.  If you catch your shoes on them they will pop off.  Then you have to crawl into a small area, (I'm a large person) and snap the panels back on.
      I recommend this car for small families, couples or singles.  It is also good for anyone who has a long costly commute to work.  This car is not very suitable for large families because of its small size.<br><br>
