            I just got this camera for Christmas, and so far I am extremely pleased with the results.  I have to say, I am very picky about my photo quality, and I currently carry around my Nikon APS S2000 around in my purse.  I was hoping this digital camera would replace it.  I think it will.  I CAN tell the difference between the digital and APS picture quality, however.  I was hoping that with a 2.1 megapixel camera, this wouldn't be the case.  Overall, though, the quality is excellent.  It's just that the lighting is a little off.  The image quality is definitely there (can see a person's complexion more than you'd like to, maybe!) but sometimes backlight can be a problem.  All of my pictures have been taken indoors; probably be better outside, I'd imagine.
Anyway, I have used a few of the features on the camera, but have not discovered all.  I am more a point and shoot photographer.
The camera body itself is awesome.  The best looking one out there, regardless of price.  It is very cool looking.  That was not a factor in my purchase, but it's definitely a plus, now that I own one!
The buttons are fairly easy to use in maneuvering about in the menus.  It took a little studying for me, but now I understand how it works overall.  The software was very easy to install and use, also.
The LCD screen is extremely bright and sharp, excellent.
My only gripes about this camera are:  It comes with no AC Adapter, though the manual states that it must be used to hook up to the computer to upload images so as not to drain the battery.  I went all over town looking for an adapter, and no place carried it.  I ended up ordering one online, and in the meantime tried to run off the fully charged battery.  It worked fine.
Also, the 8 MB card only holds about 7 high resolution pictures.  Not much if you plan to use this as your everyday camera.  (High resolution is needed to print quality 4x6 prints.  Otherwise, you can get many more pictures, if you are just going to email them and/or post them to websites.)
I haven't made any prints yet but will update my review when I do.  That's the reason I bought this higher pixel camera - so I could make prints with it, not exclusively for web use.
Overall, I am very happy with this product so far, and would highly recommend it.
