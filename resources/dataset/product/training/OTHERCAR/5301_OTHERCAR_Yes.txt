            I bought this car new in August of 1998 and it replaced a 1995 Accord LX Sedan that I traded in to the dealership.  The EX-V6 is a sensational car that has served me and my wife well for the past year and a half.  I say this for a number of reasons:

1) The car has NEVER needed service of any kind except for factory recommended maintenance.  As with our previous Honda, reliability is this car's best feature.

2) The ride is superb.  The engine in this model has pickup and spunk that the 4 cylinder Accords do not, without jumping into that &quot;boat&quot; category V-8 engine.

3) The interior design of the car is luxurious without being pretentious.  I feel just as comfortable driving my boss to a meeting as I do taking the dog to the vet.  Leather seats and wood trim give the car a sense of class.

4) Overall performance.  Whethers it's gas mileage, trunk space, the sound system, or any other facet of the car, the 1998 Accord EX-V6 has been up to the task for this owner.

On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate the Accord EX-V6 a 10+ and even if I could afford a more expensive car (i.e. a Lexus) I am not sure that I would need to!<br><br>
