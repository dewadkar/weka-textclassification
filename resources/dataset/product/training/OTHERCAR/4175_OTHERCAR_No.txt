            We purchased the Isuzu Rodeo one and a half years ago, when we found out we were having our first child. We wanted a larger car that could easily accommodate a child seat, more trunk space for the stroller.

EXTERIOR: 9
I think the '95 Isuzu Rodeo is an extremely good looking truck. The paint job still looks awesome after 7 years.

INTERIOR: 8
The interior is extremely spacious, especially the rear seat. The cargo area is extremely roomy also. We were able to move across country with 3 months of supplies, with everything fitting into our car! 

ENGINE: 4
The V6 engine has good pick-up, but we have had a LOT of problems with this truck. In the past few months we've had to replace the alternator, thermostat and radiator.

RIDE: 7
The ride is fairly smooth, and most small bumps can't be felt. However, if you hit a pothole or speed bump, it can be a really jarring experience. The car is also pretty noisy, with wind noise and road noise, although the engine is quiet.

HANDLING: 9
The car does handle very well, for a SUV. The corners are easy, I never felt in danger of tipping. It even made a relatively easy job of parallel parking.

RELIABILITY: 3
In the past year that we have owned this car, we have had to replace the alternator, thermostat, radiator and shocks twice. This car only has 55,000! 

VALUE: 4
Considering all the problems I've had with this car, I would not purchase an Isuzu again. It is not worth a lower price tag when you are throwing aways hundreds of dollars on car repair bills!

VERDICT: Poorly made car, cons outweigh the pros. Save money by buying a new model, or different make!



SCORE: 6.8 out of 10
