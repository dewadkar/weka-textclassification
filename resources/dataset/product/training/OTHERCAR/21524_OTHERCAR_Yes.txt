            We bought our 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee from Carmax in August of 2002 and it had 9000 miles on it. It has been a fantastic vehicle. We travel 6 hours in one direction to one set of grand parents and 3.5 hours the other direction to another set of grand parents and this vehicle is great for road trips. 

The front seats obviously have great visibility, in addition the rear seat has it as well. Also the seats are very comfortable for those really long trips, especially the front bucket seats. We have an option that has the stereo controls on the back side of the steering wheel in addition to the controls on the radio. I have found that this feature is particularly handy for road trips when you are speeding along at 70 MPH and don't want to take your hands off the wheel. We also have the basic cruise control and tilt wheel package which is invaluable on long trips. The electronic seat adjustments work great and I use them often as my wife and I use different settings. 

There are only two things I don't like about the vehicle. First it is a little top heavy so I worry about roll overs. However, It doesn't feel like it rolls significantly. It drives just like a car, but the factory put warning stickers in several places making sure that we know there is a roll over risk. Second, I wish I had a positrack rear end since it is only a two wheel drive. I would feel much more secure on slushy roads with that added. 

Mileage is good - about what we expected low 20's MPG on the highway. Storage for luggage is great in the back. It is amazing how much stuff you can put back there. Also for low items you can cover them with a pull across cover so nobody can see them from outside the vehicle. 

The A/C works great in our Houston weather (very important for the southerners). Haven't turned the heater on much but it seems OK. There are only vents in the front so people in the second set might not get great air flow. The window locking feature is very important as my 21 month old son has figured out how to raise and lower the windows. The second seat is good for a car seat. My son sits high enough to see out the window. He is not buried down in a back seat with nothing to look at on trips. 

We have only had one scheduled service and nothing has gone wrong with the vehicle. So far it has been extremely dependable. It is still under factory warranty at this point (~13000 miles now). 

All in all this has been a great vehicle and a good value for what we got. I highly recommend one for your road trips.
