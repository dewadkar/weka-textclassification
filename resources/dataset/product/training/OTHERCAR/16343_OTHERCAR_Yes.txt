               I have the c200 camera. It has some great features. It is small, about the same size as most of the 35-mm cameras. It has auto focus. It has a feature for the red eyes. Mine only came with the computer cable. I have to buy the ac adapter. It does go through batteries unbelievably fast, even the batteries for the high tech gadgets. Mine will take 17,40 or 80 pictures depending on the resolution and I honestly haven�t seen that much difference in any of the levels.
   I personally am still trying to figure out how to view the pictures I have already taken. My husband knows how. Me on the other hand, Mrs. Refuse-to-read-instructions-woman, I haven�t figured it out or hit the right button yet! It is really neat though and I think it is totally awesome to be able to come home download and print my pictures! I will never go back to a regular camera again!
