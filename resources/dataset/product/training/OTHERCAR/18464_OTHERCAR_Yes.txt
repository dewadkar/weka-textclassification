            When I look at this ride (I can't call it a car) I feel like he's saying to me that he will take every challenge. It looks like nothing but power and guts. The nose alone, wow, some extra holes in it and a large wide-open spread mouth give it an eager appearance. The back also looks quite impressive with its 4 huge exhaust pipes and the subtle, fine "waves" in the coach-work turns it into a beauty for sure.

Of course this powerful look has to be supported by superior technique. This was also taken care of: the 5.6-litre along with some other adjustments provide an increase of capacity from 300 to a heavy 380 hp.
And with a sprint to 100 km/h in 6 seconds and a peak of 250 km/h this beautiful monster is definitely one of the fastest boys of the class. This however still doesn't make it into a sports-wagon, therefore he's way to big.

The immense engine room is not only embellished by a splendid V12, but also through various advanced electronic systems.
It has a traction-control-system which recalls the clutch if a wheel would run on. One push on the button of the EML, right next to the six-gear box, makes the V12 react totally different to the accelerator. Everything is a bit more supple. This ables the pilot to dose the power even more accurately. Ideal for start-stop traffic.
It's just not suitable to pull up with almost spinning wheels because you accidentally pushed the pedal a bit too far. Because with so much horse power the difference between fast and very, very fast is a fraction of a millimeter.
Another advantage is the fuel compensation is a bit more within the limits. But if you can afford this ride it shouldn't count.
A special structure takes care of a pleasurable behavior in the turns because the back wheels steer along with the rest.

Naturally you will find all kind off luxuries in this expensive ride. This model has beautiful leather interior of sport seats. And because the back seat offers almost no room for the legs, you can put it down to transport even more luggage. A rare practical detail for this type of ride.

All in: you should definitely ride once in this one.
