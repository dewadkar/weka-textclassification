            UPDATE :
I've owned this minivan for almost a year. I can't imagine living without it now. Other than routine maintenance the vehicle has performed flawlessly. One more than one occasion I've taken all the seats out and filled it up to capacity. We're going to the in-laws for Christmas and we're going to take out 3 seats so we have enough room for all of the Christmas presents. I'm not sure of any other vehicle that is so versatile.

It still drives like a charm and is quiet as a mouse. It's a breeze to get my son in and out of it. I've been inside other minivans including those from Chevy and Ford - the Chrysler seems so much more refined. It's a little bit bigger too and you can really notice the room.

As pathetic as it sounds I can't imagine not having my minivan.



UPDATE :

I've owned this minivan for a little over 6 months and put 8,000 miles on it. We took a long trip to Nashville in it about a month ago. This thing has been incredible! I absolutely love this minivan. My wife (a minivan hater) has also grown to love it. It is by far the quietest vehicle I've ever driven. I've been getting about 20 mpg lately as well which is good. There isn't a thing I wouldn't change about this minivan.


I did a fair amount of research on minivans. My previous car was a 1999 Jeep Cherokee but trying to get an 8 week old in and out was too hard. I decided on the Chrysler Town and Country LXI.

I've been very impressed with the minivan so far. My only other experience was with a Ford Windstar and a Honda Odyssey, and I found the Chrysler is much quieter and roomier.

This minivan is amazingly quiet! You would have to take it for a test drive to really understand what I mean. My parents owned a 1999 Town and Country and this is like night and day in terms of sound and refinement.

I have found ample room in this minivan as well. There is enough room to get from the front to back and out the doors. The Windstar seemed a bit too small to me. The removable center console is a great option - making getting around much easier. 

The power sliding doors are great, but nearly every minivan has them. What sets this apart is the power rear hatch. It is so convenient to click the key and have the hatch open with a remote. I didnt think I would use it that often, but it is as important as the power side doors.

The interior is well thought out. The seats are very comfortable. I opted to go with high end cloth seats and not the leather and have been happy with them. My minivan came with the 210 hp 3.8 V-6 and I have been happy with that too.

Mine came with the 3 zone air and heat controls. I'm not sure how effective they are, but it is a nice option. The Infinity Stereo is superb as well.

The car is very nice to drive, offering a smooth and quiet ride. The brakes are very good and acceleration is good with the 3.8 engine.

The only complaint I had was with the optioning of the car. Mine came with hubcaps - I wanted rims. I felt that if you pay 27 thousand dollars for a car you should get rims. The only real way, other than ordering it with rims, is to go with the leather seat option which adds another $1600 to the price of the van. While I do like the styling of the minivan, I think the Odyssey looks a bit better.
