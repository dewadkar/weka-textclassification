            This is my first digital camera and I am quite pleased with it.  My primary use is for family snapshots. The picture quality is excellent, the images are sharp, have very good contrast and color intensity. When used in the default point and shoot mode, the camera is a breeze to use. There are a multitude of other modes including shutter priority, aperture priority, and full manual mode, quicktime movies and a number of preprogrammed modes for various situations.  I'm sure if you had the time and patience to practice using all those modes they would be quite useful in special situations and eventually would become easy to use.  However, though I have read the lengthy manual and tried to use the other modes, it takes a lot of effort to set them up.

Downloading pictures to a USB capable PC is a snap.  Battery life with a charged set of NiMH AA's is about 180 shots using the optical viewfinder, less if you use the LCD viewfinder.  A 128M Smartmedia card will hold 160 shots in the default HQ mode (2048 x 1536).  

There are a few changes I would make to the camera. 

1. A better lens cap arrangement is a must.  The cap attaches to the camera body, not the lens.  When the camera is turned on with the cap on, the lens will push against the cap as it tries to extend, making an awful grinding sound.  I have bought an accessory extender to attach a filter and lens cap to which does not interfere with the lens' movement.

2. There is no external flash attachment.  The built in flash limits the ability to get good indoor shots as you get a harsh direct flash and you'll frequently get red eyes, even with the red eye reduction mode.  An external flash synch connector to allow a bounce flash would allow for much nicer indoor pictures.

3. A video output would be nice, as would be the ability to record sound with movies, but in honesty, I've only tried the movie mode once to see how it worked.  The camera is primarily to take still photos and it does an excellent job at that.

I've had this camera for a year now.  I've probably taken more than a thousand pictures in that time (I sure wouldn't have taken that many with a film camera). I've had no problems with durability or defects. It's no longer in production, but can be had for $300 online.  There are newer, more capable cameras available, but if you can get this one inexpensively it is an excellent model.
