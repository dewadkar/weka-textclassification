            My wife and I bought our 98 4Runner from our friends as they were switching vehicles and didn't want to trade it in.  It only had 17000 miles on it.  It had appealed to me because it looked good, had a 4 cylinder engine for better gas mileage, and I knew would be good mechanically.  I was right about these things.  But after owning it for a few months I began to dislike the thing.  First, acceleration is very slow and strained with the four.  The SR5 V6 will be better.  Seats are uncomfortable, but ride quality and freeway noise are the worst of any SUV I've ever ridden in or driven, and that's alot.  Went on vacation to Florida and actually was getting motion sickness in this vehicle, bumpy and jittery ride.  Felt relieved to make it back home! After the trip we agreed to get rid of it! Also, the cupholders are flimsy, thin plastic (they broke) and placed right in front of the a/c controls and vent, so you have to move them if you want to make a/c adjustments.  Poor engineering throughout the inside.  Toyota may have improved since 1998 with the 4Runner, and their engines are superior to most domestics (I am an auto tech), but they remain light years behind Ford's Explorer/Expedition and GM's Suburban in ride comfort and interior engineering in my opinion.  Most full size SUV's are body on frame, which would preclude a somewhat stiff ride, but this one was like an old pickup truck! Check out Ford's 2002 and later SUV's for independent rear suspension and ride in one, you will see the difference it makes.  I don't recommend this particular year of Toyota for a good choice.
