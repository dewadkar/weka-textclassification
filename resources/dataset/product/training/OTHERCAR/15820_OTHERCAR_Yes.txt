            I am a &quot;Toyota person&quot;, meaning my last 4 cars were Toyotas.  I had 2 Celica's, an Avalon and now a Solara.  I lease my cars, so that I get a lot of car for my money.  I turned in my 1996 Avalon in 1999 and got a new Solara with a V-6 engine.  At first, I really liked it.  Nice ride, pretty smooth, okay turning.  Then as the year went on, I realized that I still yearned for my Avalon!  This is a decent car. Really! It gets me to work and back. I just think that it is missing some of the typical Toyota quality I am used to.  For instance, my car is now one year old...When it rains, the dashboard rattles; The seats are made pretty narrow and are not comfortable for long trips; and last, it is not great on gas (I'm getting about 19 - 22 MPG Highway).  If you are looking for a decent car, then buy this.  If you want luxury and comfort, move up to the Avalon. Now THAT IS A GREAT car!  <br><br>
