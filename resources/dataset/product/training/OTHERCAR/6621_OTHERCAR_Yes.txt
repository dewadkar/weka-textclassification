            My husband surprised me with my Passat for our third anniversary. Boy was I surprised! I had been talking about wanting a Passat for awhile. I love the way they look and I know Volkswagons had a good reputation. Ofcourse he bought it used and alot of people don't maintain their cars. So I have had one problem with it, but that's it. I've had this car almost a year. It is very roomy, lots of leg room even in the back. The trunk is huge. I an fit my double stroller in there fine. I don't struggle with it when it comes time to take it out and i just push it all the way back when I need to fit groceries. The steering is so smooth, the seats are comfortable and the seat belts are automatic, so now I can't forget to put them on, it also has a sunroof. The car seats fit perfectly in the back seat. They don't move around and the backs are aligned with the back of the seats. Overall wonderful car and don't regret buying it.<br><br>
