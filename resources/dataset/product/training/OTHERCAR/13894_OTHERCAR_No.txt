            When I had my '98 Saturn SL-1, I was quite happy with the car. It drove great, and it was a very reliable car. The only problem was that without air conditioning, the inside of the car would literally get so hot that I would have to stop, get out and throw up (several times) on hot days.

So in January, I traded in the '98 for a 2001. The new car was essentially the same as the old one, except the newer year, with air conditioning, and a CD player instead of cassette.

When I first got my new SL-1, I loved it! The seats were noticeably more comfortable than in the '98 model (even though they look the same), although they're still a pain on the back after a couple hours. The car drove very nicely, and the mileage was great.

On the 13th day that I had the new car, my cousin & I were on the way to see a movie. I was telling her how much I loved the new car, when the engine just died and wouldn't start again. It had to be towed back to the dealership, where they had to rebuild the engine.

I have the Saturn extended service plan, which says they <b><i>provide</i></b> a rental car in such cases. Not exactly true. I had to go out and get my own rental car, and since I don't have a credit card, I had to get someone else to rent a car for me. Not exactly what Saturn's extended service plan promises.

The next day, I went into the dealership (Hyatt in Calgary, Alberta) to see what the problem was. The timing chain, gear that the timing chain moves around, valves, heads and pistons were all shot. The service department wasn't sure which part had caused the problem.

I told them right away that I wanted a new car, as I was still well within the 30 day / 2500 km period. I had to wait for the new car, and had to drive the "rebuilt" one for almost 2 weeks after.

I am glad that I got another car, because the first one wasn't right at all after the repairs. The engine was loud, and the gas mileage wasn't as good.

Hyatt took their sweet time in getting me another car. I originally picked out a new one, and even though the car was ON THEIR LOT, I still didn't have the car 11 days later. I also hadn't heard from them.

I had to phone the dealership several times and bug them, and keep reminding them that I wanted a new car.

The service wasn't anything like in the commercials where they understand and are nice about it. When I started to complain, they started to treat me like I was a pest. The sales manager actually commented to me that this was a great big hassle for them (as if it wasn't a great big hassle for <i>me</i>)!

I ended up making them get another car in from out of town, because I figured with all the hassles I had to go through, and considering Hyatt's procrastination, I might as well get the color that I really wanted (blue).

When I picked up my new car, Hyatt hadn't installed the cruise or remote starter. I had to wait for a week, because in order to save a few bucks, they decided to rip that stuff out of the lemon car, and put it into the new one.

Then, when they installed the cruise control (they have to swap out the steering wheel), they broke the clear plastic panel that's in front of the odometer. So I had to go back and complain.

I've had the new (blue) car now for about 6 weeks, and I've had no problems with it so far, but I'm not enjoying the car as much.

As well, even though it's only been 6 weeks, the upholstery on the driver's seat is extremely "pilled" (little balls of fabric have been formed on the surface - showing wear on the fabric). My '98 never had that problem. The fabric on the seats was of higher quality.

Overall, my opinion of the new car is that it's very mediocre.
