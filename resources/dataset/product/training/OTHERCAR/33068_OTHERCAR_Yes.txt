              I have working for small computer service company for over six years, and we cover the entire state of Oklahoma and into Texas and Arkansas, this leads to a lot of driving well over 40,000 miles a year. 

  We were required for the first six months to drive our own personal cars, but then the company bought a small fleet of small pickups and put camper shells on them, and as the business grew they added several new small pickups and put camper shells. 
  
  When it came time for new truck's to replace the very first fleet of trucks, after checking out all the available models of the same makes as the earlier trucks, the owner decided on the '99 GMC Sonoma , she purchased the SLS model which is an extended cab with two fold down seats for passengers, this small of a truck will really only fit small children in the fold down seats.

  The extended cab allows for quite a bit a storage back behind the seats, and in my job I need to have room to carry computer equipment and my tools. The bed of the truck is not extremely long, but it will carry quite a bit of cargo, the company relocated last year and we packed these truck's with PC monitors and computers and they handled them well, I also just recently carried a 500 lb. printer in the back and the truck ran well. The payload according to the manufacture is 1200 lb., and I believe it would handle it based on moving the printer.

  The model she selected also comes with cloth interior which is great for the extended trips I have to take from time to time, it also comes with a 6 speaker stereo with CD player. AC and 5 speed with cruise control, I don't know about you but I have never heard of a cruise control in a standard transmission before ( I love that option for the highway driving). 

  PRO's  I have to say the comfort of this truck is the biggest plus I have experienced. The cloth seats and the AC and 6 speaker stereo w/ CD. It also has a fold up arm rest which is also a storage box for small items like CD's and maps and change. There is also a over sized cup holder in the console behind the shifter. Another feature I like it has the the passenger airbag disable switch so if I happen to be driving with my kids in the front seat I don't have to worry about the airbag injuring them.

  Con's The only downside to this truck was the choice of engine, the small 4 cylinder engine (2.2 liter)has absolutely no pick up at all. The 4 cylinder was chosen due to the better gas mileage, since I do drive a lot of miles. The fuel mileage figures are 23/29, I feel the need for better fuel economy was justified the choice of the smaller engine. 

  The optional engine is a 4.3 liter Vortec 6 cylinder and that will drop the fuel mileage down to 17/21. The truck also has optional 4WD, in both the extended cab and regular cab models. 

  I have explained the interior, now for the exterior. There are 4 color's to choose from, Indigo blue, Meadow green,Victory red and Gold.

  All in all a great little truck and I would recommend it to someone looking for a comfortable small truck for long hauls and medium payload.
