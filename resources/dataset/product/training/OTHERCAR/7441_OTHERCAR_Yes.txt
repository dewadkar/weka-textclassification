            I love my NEW CAR.  I've had it for 3 weeks and if it were a person I'd make love to it!  I knew the title would get attention.

For starters there is so much room you can easily fit 3 adults in the back.  You would never guess it by looking at the outside but the inside is ROOMY.  My 300lb. Father fit in the front comfortably as well.

The Engine is a powerhouse. It was built with a V6 and RAM Air.  I don't particularly know at this point what the Ram AIR does but let's just say it acts like TURBO. You step on the gas and this car goes.  The steering is yet another one of my favorites. It is as sensitive as a baby's bottom. You get used to it the minute you drive it.  Rack a pinion of course.  It also has the double muffler system, must love that.  Lastly, and another favorite of mine ETS.  It's a traction system that actually alerts you while you are driving and helps maintain 4-wheel balance.  It actually puts power where it is needed.  This option can be turned of as well.  WONDERFUL for the snow or rain.

EXTRAS!!!  Lot's of great little features also.  If you're a smoker the ashtray can be moved and fits into the cup holders.  ALL 3 of them!    Mine also came with a Power Sunroof. I hit the button once, it cracks up, twice and it goes all the way back.  That way you can keep your hands on the wheel where they're supposed to be.  I am going to list the additional features below.

-Tilt steering                             -air
-Power door locks                   -cruise control
-Remote entry/trunk		-power windows
-Child locks			-standard CD and tape player
-Cargo net			-Anti-lock brakes
-Automatic day lights		-reading lamps
-Power seat			-wiper delay modes
-7 sec. lock delay	
		
I'm probably forgetting something; it has SO much to play with. I must comment on the headlights.  They are wonderful.  Halogen and HIGHLY powerful.  They are also reflective and shoot a beam of to the side.  This helps to alert animals that you are coming.  I LOVE this feature also. OOOO, all the windows have a slight tint to help sun glare.  Also, the seats are so comfortable you could sleep in them.  The interior lighting is SUPERB as well. All controls are lit up, including the door locks and windows. They are orange and wonderful.  Gas mileage is okay.  They didn't have a GT available in standard so I had to get automatic.  I get about 20 miles p/g city and 40 highway.  

Obviously you can tell I love my car. One more thing, the sound system is loud and includes an equalizer.  Trust me you will have to turn down the bass.  I couldn't believe this came standard with the car.  

The only negative I have is the height of the back.  You can't see much and it causes a really bad blind spot when backing up. That is the only con, as of yet. Test drive one, I guarantee you'll love it!
