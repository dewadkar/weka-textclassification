            As a preface, I am very much a beginner to photography.  Olympus designed the C-2500L with the professional and advanced amateur in mind.  I think that the camera is a bit overkill for the beginner, but could be very useful for the advanced amateur.
  
Now, many cameras offer 2M+ pixel CCDs, but the Olympus�s 2/3-inch CCD and with TruePic Technology is capable of capturing a resolution of 1712 x 1368 in 24-bit color.  This impressive ability means that it can gobble all but the largest memory cards with a few pictures. The five compression modes--SHQ-Tiff for uncompressed 1712 X 1368 pixel images, SHQ-JPEG with low 1:2.3 compression 1712 X 1368 pixel images, HQ-JPEG with low 1:8 compression 1712 X 1368 pixel images, SQ-JPEG SVGA 1280 X 1024 pixel images, and SQ-JPEG VGA 640 X 512 pixel images�affect the amount of memory needed for each shot.  Long story short, get thee a couple of large CompactFlash and/or SmartMedia cards.  Along with memory gobbling, the power consumption of this camera (and virtually all digital cameras of this level) is also impressive.  I recommend at least four extra AA rechargeable batteries.

I like that the C-2500L gives you control over fully automatic or fully manual exposure, white balance and focus, and a 3x optical zoom.  I also like that it may be connected to an external flash at a flash connection.  I know that Olympus has additional lenses like the B-28 and 1.45x telephoto, but these are beyond my scope.  What was a big improvement over my former digital camera was the �real-time� rapid shooting mode.  The camera has a 16MB buffer that allows for rapidly shooting up to five photos, which are then processed.  

I�m still struggling to take good pictures with the built-in pop-up flash.  I�m sure that the +/- 2-step exposure control and the external hot-shoe flashes would be more useful to those with a little more know-how.  The red eye reduction works pretty well.  It emits a series of pre-flashes right before the shutter snaps to allow the eyes of your subject to adjust to the light level of the flash.   

Aesthetically, I really like the leather case.  It has pockets for additional batteries and memory cards.  For longer, more involved settings, it would be nice to have a bag for the additional lenses, flashes, recharger, etc. that you need to carry.   As for the included software, it includes some neat software like QuickStitch.  I�m a PhotoShop fan, so I do not use much of the other software.  The camera definitely lends itself to great photos, but may be a bit intimidating for the neophyte.
