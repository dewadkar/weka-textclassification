            Doing research is the first step to understanding what you are getting into. I narrowed down several cars in under $18,000 and bought 1995 Nissan Maxima at the end of 1997 for under $14,000. The few problems I had were with 'check engine light' which was mostly caused by bad low grade gas I got to save a few cents. I had to replace filters and starter - but it was more as a precaution.  I had taken good care of the vehicle, and so far didn't make too many trips to the dealer or mechanic.

I wanted the comfort of my seats, elbow room, GREAT STEREO, luxury of power windows and  power seats of the high-priced sedans. I also wanted the safety many cars promise. I considered a vehicle that is rated among the safest (Volvo my first choice), and I didn't have the money to throw around. Did I mention I love the elbow room? I drove a Honda Civic 2 door and Maxima seemed like heaven afterwards. I am able to drive over 300 miles one way with 2 stops without a problem on cruise control and without, and 220 miles without a stop - the legs do not get tired.

I like the way the seats are positioned - the hood of the car seems to disappear in front of you. The handling of the wheel and breaks was so comfortable compared to Chevi Cavalier, I had to rub my eyes to believe it was real.  I can say my back seat passenger never complain about leg room. The AC reaches them just in time. 

Do the research to see for yourself, but testdrive as many cars as you can to see what you personally find comfortable. <br><br>
