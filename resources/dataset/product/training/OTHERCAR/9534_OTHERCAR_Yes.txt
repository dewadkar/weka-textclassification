                About 2 years ago i went out to my local cheverlet dealer and traded a Grand Prix for a Monte Carlo.  The best thing was that it wasnt too muche with the trade in of my Grand Prix.  I bought the car because i thought that i needed a new car and i liked the test drive of the monte carlo.  I love its ability to pick-up, and to cut the corners as sharp as you need them.  I dont like my leather interior but that isnt the cars fault it was my fault for picking it.  The monte carlo drives like the average chevy... sensitive stearing, good conering, and not a lot of trips to the shop.  Guys who like a little power, but not a lot and a good luxury car for long trips and also comfortable short rides.<br><br>
