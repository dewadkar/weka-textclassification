            The sleeper family sedan for those of you on a budget...

First of all, it should be noted that the S6 should also be grouped with the 1992-1994 Audi S4 models as they were essentially the same vehicle.  The car was given the S6 name in 1995 and the last models left US showrooms as '96 feature cars albeit still badged as '95 models (sometimes called '95.5 models).  

The UrS4/S6 (Ur meaning &quot;original&quot; in German) was basically a hot version of the Audi 100/A6 model.  The S4/S6 cars were given Audi's workhorse 20 valve turbo inline 5 cylinder engine (originally developed for rally use in the potent Sport Quattro).  In stock form, the 227 hp and 258 lb ft of torque (at only 1950 RPM) are good for 0-60 in under 6.5 seconds.  Pretty impressive performance for a 3800 lb sedan capable of seating four adults in comfort.  

The S4/S6 comes equipped with a sportier suspension than that of the 100/A6 models.  The steering is very light at low speed due to the servotronic boosted steering system.  If you find the over assisted steering annoying, rest assured that the over boosted nature of the servotronic system can be easily disabled... then you are back to just power steering which many owners prefer.  The braking system is decent for daily drive purposes, but if you plan to take the car on the track or do a fair amount of mountain driving you may want to invest in some braking upgrades.  A modest investment will also boost you up near 300 HP without destroying the daily driver characteristic of the car. 

Reliability is typically very good.  A few of the early cars suffered transmission failures due to pinion bearing failure, but most have been replaced by this time.  Other possible trouble areas include leaking power steering pumps/racks, frozen rear brake calipers (more often found in &quot;snow belt&quot; cars), and leaking fuel lines.  To their credit, Audi of America has been pretty good about replacing the leaky fuel lines at no charge even if the car is out of warranty.  

When buying, look for well maintained cars... if the car does not have a complete service history by an Audi dealer or other specialist be suspicious.  The cars are great if they have been taken care of, but neglected cars can really rack up bills.  Always have a pro look at the car prior to purchase!

In short, the UrS4/S6 models represent fantastic used car buys on the market today with prices as low as $11,000 for high mileage '92 model S4s.  More detailed buyer's guide information and classifieds can be found on my web site.  (s-cars.org)

Give the S4/S6 a try... I think you will like what you see!


P.S. = I noted 1992 - 1997 models even though they quit being sold in the USA in late '95.  The Canadian market got the S6 through model year 1997 and they CAN be imported to the USA.  <br><br>
