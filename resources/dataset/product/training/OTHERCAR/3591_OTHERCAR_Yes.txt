            This camera is the successor to the highly successful PowerShot G1 by Canon.  It has many of the same features, but with much more power under it's belt.

One of the main differences of course, is the pixel count.  With 4.1 megapixels of power, producing 2,272x1,704-pixel images, you are sure to be impressed at the quality of an everyday shoot.  I certainly was!  Although the camera came with an extensive manual, taking regular shots in the auto mode proved to be a piece of cake.  Although I have only recently begun to unviel the sheer power of this camera, it is easy to get started if you don't want to use any of the sophisticated features and just want to take some pictures.

This camera using LithiumIon batteries, and capture photos in JPEG, RAW, and short movies in MPEG format.  It uses a USB interface that is easy to connect to transfer your digital photos.  I didn't have any problems setting up the included software and hardware.

The camera provided me with pretty fast focusing w/ LCD turned off, and a little slower with it turned on.  It decent battery life as I have taken about 100 photos on this set, mostly with LCD off.  It comes with an excellent remote control so that you can easily take pictures from a tripod and now you can be in them at your own discretion and timing.

Most importantly is the sharpness and color saturation of photos, which is no less than stunning.  Overall, I would recommend this camera to the individual looking for a powerful amateur-pro digital camera.  I would steer clear for the novice just looking for a point and shoot, considering it costs upwards of $750 in most cases.
