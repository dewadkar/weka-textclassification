            I'll just get right down to it on this car. . . I've had it for 5 years, got it used, and cheap, less than $2000, and it hasn't failed me yet.  The engine is reliable, as are all of it's major functioning parts.  It gets great gas mileage, upwards of 40 miles a gallon, and it can go pretty fast. (The fastest I've ever gone is 65 miles an hour, but I've heard stories of this guy who got it up to 110, Just don't tell the cops.)
There are some things that seem from my own car, and friends of mine with the same, to go wrong.  The passenger side seat is stuck.  The window roller has fallen off.  And yes, the radio sucks.  These are all minor considerations compared to the rest of it's good points.
Oh yeah, chicks don;t dig it.  It's not a cool sports car.  But if you don't have much money, and want a cheap dependable vehicle, I'd suggest it.
