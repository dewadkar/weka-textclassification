            First of all, before I complete this opinion I will qualify a few points:-


* I am 5�6� tall and usually buy smaller cars.
* I am not a technically advanced car user and so my opinion is purely on the aesthetics of the Sable and the performance (from a driver�s point of view.)
* I am from England and so am unused to items such as air conditioning and �automatic speed�.

<b>The look</b>

The Sable has a similar look to many of the late 90s cars, losing a bit in the aesthetics to try and squeeze out a little more aerodynamics. It has a more functional look than classy look.
I would say it is suitable as a family car, nothing special to look at and therefore perhaps less attractive to thieves. The interior is well designed, again nothing special, but very adequate and durable for the family.

<b>The feel</b>

The Sable is a deceptively nippy car from 0-60. I am not sure of the exact figures, but it has more than enough power to �burn� off most 2.0L cars. This has its advantages for family drivers, as often the safest way to get out of a dangerous situation can be to accelerate. This power does not diminish as you travel at higher speeds giving ample power for most traffic situations.
 The car drives very smoothly, with power steering enhancing the driving experience, and the steering giving a comfortable ride around corners.. The �automatic speed� is very good allowing you to set your speed at whatever level you wish. I found that the car does accelerate a little too quickly when achieving this speed automatically, but I got used to this eventually.
The automatic gearbox is generally good, although I have found a few occasions where I would like to have changed down a gear to add that little extra zip.


<b>The problems</b>

I have major problems with the air conditioning. This is surprising, as the car is only five years old. Unfortunately the car was a gift and therefore has no warranty, and I cannot currently afford to fix it!
The car is a little expensive on gas, not getting great mileage per gallon. Part of this is probably due to the excessive acceleration in �automatic speed� mode.

<b>Conclusion</b>

Generally I like the Sable. Even for a short person like myself, the car does not feel to big. It handles well, and is an enjoyable car to drive. It is spacious enough for 4 adults, or 2 adults and 3 children.
The car is big enough to pull a small caravan, and has been very reliable over the five years. The body work is in very good condition and does not seem susceptible to rust.
