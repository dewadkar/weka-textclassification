            My Dad owned big cars and I have always been enamoured of Cadillacs, Lincolns,  and big Chryslers. A long time ago I took my driver's test in my Dad's 1957 Imperial.  Dad owned a 1953, 1957, 1960, and 2 1962 Imperials, and 1956, 1969, and 1974 Cadillacs.  I bought my first Cadillac, a 1977, in 1983 and ran it up to 150,000 miles with no major problems.  In the summer of 2000, I found my 1989 Fleetwood on a used car lot sporting 10 Cadillacs.  It was in beautiful condition, no rust, excellent leather interior, with 84,000 miles and all the amenities one could desire.  I plunked down my $4900 and drove it home the same day.  It is an extremely comfortable, fine-driving reliable car.  It hasn't needed a lot of maintenance, but parts and labor are more expensive than for other lesser cars.  It now has 101,000 miles on it and still drives like  a new car.  Gas mileage (uses regular) has been around 15 in town and 25 on the highway, easy to keep track of with the very accurate fuel computer that shows instantaneous and average fuel economy, fuel range remaining, and gallons used or remaining.  The driver's seat is electrically adjustable to a wide variety of positions, with two memory settings.  The rear seats are complimented with courtesy mirrors and lights in the ceiling.  This is a real travelling machine that eats thru the miles effortlessly and surrounds me in comfort while I enjoy the Bose sound system with cassette.  Other goodies:  Auto-levelling shocks, tilt/telescope steering wheel, air conditioning/climate control that really cools, heated remote-control mirrors, cruise control.
