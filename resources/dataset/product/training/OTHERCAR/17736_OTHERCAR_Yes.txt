            I have 4 children, a stepdaughter, and a husband so I really need a minivan with my herd but that�s NOT what this epinion is about.  I was desperate for a vehicle that would #1 give me the best possible gas mileage #2 be reliable (you know the kind that doesn�t leave you stranded on the side of the road 2 hours from home) #3 be a safe ride for me AND my children, #4 be newer than 1995 (I have never owned anything newer than 1990) and finally #5 have a reasonable price. What I found was a 2000 Saturn SL2.

My dad sent me to the dealer that he goes to on a regular basis and I thought I�ll never find what I need but okay. They didn�t have any minivans so I said okay show me what you do have. The first car I looked at was a 2000 Ford Focus and I liked it but wasn�t too sure about how �safe� it would be.  So the salesman showed me a maroon 2000 Saturn SL2 and asked if I�d like to drive it. Well why not, at least I can say I drove a 2000 year model car!

 At first I didn�t care for how the seat felt, but once I adjusted it (I am rather short) and found a spot that was relatively comfortable it got better.  I like the automatic �in the floor�, the MANUAL door locks, windows, and seats (power never seems to work for long). I didn�t like that there is no cruise control, no tape deck and to adjust the mirror on the passenger side you have to roll down the window and adjust.  

The Saturn had 34,600 miles on it and still had a little bit of the warranty left, which I liked. After driving it for a while I decided that I did like it and wanted to see what the salesman could do for me before I would make my decision. Well the next thing he said put the final nail in that box, the Saturn has been ranked #1 in safety for the past couple of years. With 5 children safety is very important to me and something I don�t tinker with! I signed on the car that day and drove home in it right then.

My Saturn has a light that comes on automatically when you need to change the oil, that I love because I tend to forget about that. When it comes to acceleration, well my car tends to accelerate very well and the gas mileage is great. I can go 300-400 miles on one tank of gas depending on where I am driving.  I make several trips a month to Little Rock (a 2 1/2 hour drive on the interstate) and the gas mileage helps me out alot!

The bottom line is that if you are looking for a reasonably priced, safe car and you don�t have a big family and aren�t overly large/tall then this car is definitely one you should check out! I love my car and though I wish for a minivan on those long road trips at least I know my kids are safe and we won�t be left on the side of the road.
