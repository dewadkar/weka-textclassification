            I first decided to buy a Toyota 4Runner when I decided that I wanted an sport utility vehicle because I needed a way to cart around my mountain bike. I quickly changed gears however when I found out I could get a 4x4 Honda Passport for 4 thousand dollars less than a 4x4 4runner with the same goodies. The air conditioning and power everything as standard was very impressive.

There are some improvements that could be made such as the turning radius and the ability to automatically shift into 4 wheel when needed such as the Ford Explorer and others but I thought those were not as important as price, power and quality. 

I previously drove a Honda Civic and was already very familiar with the Honda service and quality of their vehicles.

The looks of the Honda Passport are same as the Isuzu Rodeo and the Nissan Pathfinder, so I really did not care about the look of the vehicle although it has nice lines. The interior of the vehicle has ample room, (I am 6'3 tall) compared to the 4Runner. I have 2 inches of clearance above my head in the driver seat compared to 1/2 inch in the 4Runner. Everything inside is well within reach and easy to use while driving. I actually bought the vehicle in San Francisco and Drove it to San Diego where I live the day I bought it and I was able to drive straight through to San Diego without stopping since the vehicle was so comfortable. 

The best feature of this vehicle has to be the impressive power from the 205 horsepower V6 engine. I can pass people on the freeway easily and also climb up very steep inclines as well. The handling on the road is a bit cushy, but it is still a nice ride. Off road, the vehicle rides like a dream, with its high clearance and great suspension I have no problem tooling along in the deserts of Southern California all day long. 

I think anyone who wants a 4 wheel drive that has all the bells and whistles of more expensive vehicles as well as the MOST Powerful engine in its class, should compare this vehicle to any other and you will see its a steal for the price.
