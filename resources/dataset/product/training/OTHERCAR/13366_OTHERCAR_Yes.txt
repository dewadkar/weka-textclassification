            Two years ago, on the advice of a close personal friend who just happened to be the sales manager of a local Acura dealer, I bought a 1993 Legend with a six-speed manual transmission.  Without question, it is the best car I've ever driven, much less owned, and in my 40 years of driving, I've driven a lot.  It accelerates like a rocket and tracks like a cat.  The interior appointments are elegant, and ergonomically everything is well placed.  My maintenance costs have been minimal and the car is flat-out fun to drive.  Coincidentally, I am a member of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association (the Rose Parade/Rose Bowl people) and serve currently on the Transportation Committee.  While at the corporate headquarters of American Honda, our &quot;official vehicle&quot; supplier, to pick up the Pace Car I drove last year in the parade, one of their officials looked at my Legend and said, &quot;I've worked on this car.  In fact, I installed the spoiler on it.  It was owned by one of my neighbors, an engineer, and it's one of the best cars we've ever built!&quot;  He then noticed a tear in the leather upholstery of the driver's seat, and added &quot;This is such a unique car that I'm ashamed to have you drive around with the seat this way.&quot;  I told him the dealer had quoted me a price to repair it (they had insisted on replacing the entire leather interior so the colors matched, rather than just the one seat) that I couldn't afford on a pastor's salary.  So, he arranged to have a local dealer repair it for free!!!  It looks great...and this is one great car!<br><br>
