            First off, the RAV4 is Toyota's version of a &quot;carlike&quot; SUV. My parents bought this car for my brother's birthday. I recently had an opportunity to live with this car while my brother was out of town. When I first looked at the RAV4, I went &quot;Cute&quot;. Cute is the general reaction most people get when they first see it. So I took a ride in the RAV4 and did some chores with it. I was surprised how much this little car could hold. I could fit a surprising amount of grocery bags in the back of this car. One of my favorite aspects about this vehicle is that even though it is an SUV, it doesn't drive like one. You can still tell you're driving a truck, but it feels a lot more carlike then say a 4Runner. The Fuel economy of this car is another aspect I totally love. I had this car for 2 weeks and I only had to stop at the gas station once. Despite the RAV4's multiple strengths, it has quite a few weaknesses. One of them is the lack of power. The RAV4's only engine option is the 4 cylinder 120hp engine. I just felt the RAV4 was under powered. Another weakness is the lack of people space in this car. The front passengers have plenty of room. But the rear passengers have very little leg room. I wouldn't feel right asking 3 adults sit in the back seat. It's that cramped. The backseats are best suited for young children. I recommend the RAV4 to people that like having a higher view of the road without losing too much driveability of regular cars. This car is also good for people that want a SUV but can't put out the 30+ grand for one. But I wouldn't recommend this vehicle to families. There's simply not enough room to fit people in the back seats comfortably.  <br><br>
