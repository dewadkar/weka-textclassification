            After cramming my wife into the back of a Porsche 944S2 convertible on the way home after my first child was born, her panic-stricken tears led me to consider buying a more sensible car.
I checked all the papers, and whittled a shortlist of  - BMW M5 and Mercedes 190E Cosworth.

Two days later, a friend and I had a route to take that took in a BMW and Mercedes dealer. However, we also happened to scoot past a Volvo agent on the way, whereupon we saw a dark red 850 T5R estate (wagon) on his forecourt. The dark grey wheels and tinted windows begged us to look closer, so in we swung.

The car had a flat rear tyre (more anon), but was a very rare metallic red (they were usually Yellow, Red, Black, or Green) car � especially ordered by its first owner. Two years and 20000 miles old, I was completely smitten by the look of this thing. Something as incongruous looking as a Volvo estate, but with a very low ride height, and these rubber band tyres on 17 inch grey wheels, I thought it looked fantastic. The test drive proved its looks. This was a switchable automatic version, with a beige leather interior. When you got this thing on boost (250 bhp turbocharged straight 5), it absolutely flew. I swear it was quicker than the 944. 

I didn�t bother visiting BMW &amp; Mercedes that day - I did the deal that afternoon, and drove it home three days later.

My wife was not as enamoured of the looks as I was, but she had to agree it was comfortable. And fast. 

Interior-wise, the seats are big, fat, and comfy � not that supportive or sporty, and the dash looks fairly unimpressive, with large, clumsy-looking graphics, and big buttons that could be operated while wearing boxing gloves. But in use and ergonomically, it was fantastic. The A/C was extremely effective, the stereo superb, and everything felt right and sturdy.

As for practicality, this thing was unsurpassed. The rear seats fold with a flick of a switch, and even the front seat folds flat. This feature was proved a few times � obviously when no-one was sitting there � as I was working away from home at the time, and restoring my house. I was able to get 8-foot lengths of timber in with no problems or damage at all. 
It also had a superb integrated child seat in the back (which sadly I never got to use in anger, as we sold it before my son was big enough to use it). 

Performance-wise, it was excellent. 
Made all the more amazing by the fact that this thing was a Volvo estate for goodness sake. They just should not go that quick. 
If anything, it was too powerful. 250bhp and front wheel drive means that your wheels will spin at the earliest opportunity if you�re a bit spirited. And you will be spirited in this car, because it�s just so much fun. Thankfully, Volvo fitted traction control (which you could switch off), which would rein in the power if necessary. 

The car had one service during my one year tenure, which I seem to remember cost something like a �100 ($150ish). For someone used to BMW and Porsche service costs, this was a revelation. The biggest downside to this car was its appetite for tyres. 
And not because I shredded them � I never had them long enough. The tyres that looked so impressive because of their tiny sidewalls were a unique-fit 205/40 ZR Pirelli PZero.  These tyres have a ludicrously thin (but great looking) sidewall, are inflated to 41 psi, and are Unique Fit. What this actually means is that no-one else made tyres in that size. What it also means is that they are incredibly vulnerable to high London kerbs (and believe me, I am a careful driver). If you lose pressure in one of these, and then hit a bump � even a small bump � the sidewall blisters. I had to have five new tyres in one year � and each cost me over �200. That kind of put the service costs in proportion. Mind you, one time, while driving through a scary area of South London, a traffic warden actually shouted out �nice wheels� across the street � so I guess it was worth it.

Anyway, after just under a year, my wife decided she couldn�t live with its looks any more, so practicality went out of the window, and we were 911-bound.

But my abiding memory is of one trip where I fit my son, his pram, my wife, two 7 foot six flat-packed bookcases, and weeks� shopping in with comfort. While driving home, I looked around at the space and capacity of this thing, and I just could not believe that if I wanted, it could do 150 mph and outdrag most anything I wanted. 
Now that�s a cool car.

As a final note, my sister bought an 850 GLT on my recommendation. Hers was older than mine (1992), and she still has it � it still looks and drives well, and has no discernible interior wear at all. And being a GLT, it doesn�t have those tyres�
