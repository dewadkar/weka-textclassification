            <b>An Underwhelming Introduction</b>

I accidentally rented a Grand Vitara on a recent trip out West - to Idaho to visit my father.  I had specified a mid-range sedan, but when I arrived they were all out and gave me a Grand Vitara at a great discount instead.  "What is a Grand Vitara?" I asked the clerk.  "It's an SUV.  Yours is red, waiting for you in parking spot 13 just outside."  

Well, I went outside and looked around, but I couldn't see the SUV.  See, I had this idea that SUVs are big.  All I could see was what looked like a fat, short station wagon jacked-up to ride high on its wheels.  This was, indeed, the Grand Vitara.

<b>Oh Ye of Little Room</b>

I was travelling with my 10-month old son, so I was kind of hoping that the Grand Vitara would have a good amount of room (all you parents out there know what I mean - babies have an incredible amount of gear).  Opening up the so-called "Grand" Vitara, I was shocked.  There was no more room inside than there is in a normal sedan.  In fact, I've been in sedans that have MORE room inside.  The room in back was particularly disappointing -- less length than a normal trunk.  If this was a GRAND Vitara, I shudder to think about how small the plain old regular Vitara must be.

To me, the whole point of an SUV is that it's supposed to have a lot of room inside.  What's the point of paying for all the extra gasoline if you can't carry more than in a regular old car?  

<b>A Toy With More Vroom Than Zoom</b>

I know, a lot of SUV afficianados will insist that the point of an SUV is that it's rugged.  The fact is that less than 5% of SUV owners EVER take their vehicles off-road.  

Well, I did take the Grand Vitara on some challenging roads, including the Spiral Highway above Lewiston, Idaho, and so I got a good picture of its handling.  The truth is that the thing drives like a car, and that's nice, but I never ever needed the 4WD option that I saw was available.  I drove it on narrow and steep dirt roads up the sides of canyons.  I drove it over some icy roads in the mountains of Oregon.  Never did I even think of putting it in 4WD.

On the other hand, I come from snow country, and I know that 4WD is pretty much a bunch of hype that is almost never needed.  A clue to the less-than-expert driver: if conditions really require 4WD, you shouldn't be on the road at all.  I would drive and have driven a regular sedan in almost all conditions and done just fine.

<b>So What's It For?</b>

It beats me why anyone would purchase the Grand Vitara.  If you want an SUV, get a real SUV with a huge amount of room inside.  If you want something that drives like a car, get a car.  

The Grand Vitara, like the RAV4, tries to please car drivers who like the image of the SUV.  Well, here's a clue-in, folks: the SUV doesn't have much of an image left anymore, having become the 90's equivalent of the station wagon and the minivan.  If you want to build an image through the car you drive, the Grand Vitara will just make you look silly.
