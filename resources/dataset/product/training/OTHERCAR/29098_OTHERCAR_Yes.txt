            I bought my Tacoma - the exact truck pictured by epinions - because I wanted a light truck that could get me anywhere.  Mine came off the lot with manual hubs, air-conditioning, and a manual transmission.  I immediately added a CD player - my only vehicle-related expense besides routine maintenance.  My Tacoma now has just under 50,000 miles on it with no problems whatsoever.  It's moved me from Washington State to Southern California, and then from San Diego to Virginia.

I'm fully satisfied because the Yota has done exactly what I expected it to do:  it's gone everywhere I wanted - mud, snow, and moving water - and lived to get me into the office on Monday morning.  I took it with a friend to Northern Arizona last February, where we drove it down a dirt jeep trail covered with 2 feet of snow.  We camped out at the edge of a canyon with an incredible view.  Needless to say, my friend was thoroughly impressed - and he has a Jeep CJ.

For a 4x4 that will go anywhere, the ride is excellent.  Compared to almost anything else, the ride is a bit rough - that's the price you pay for a great off-road vehicle.  The ride isn't unbearable, though.  I've made a number of trips in excess of 500 miles, and have never had fatigue problems.  The Tacoma's high ride affords an excellent view of the road ahead.

My Tacoma came with a 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine.  The V-6 was only available on the extra cab, and my understanding is that this is still the case.  The 2.7L engine has done surprisingly well both on passes and with a light trailer.  On really steep grades you may need to shift down to 4th gear, but you can almost always maintain a speed of 70 or so.  In retrospect, I would choose the 2.7L engine even if the V-6 were available in the regular cab.  The 2.7L has enough power, and the move up to a V-6 would cost a couple miles per gallon in gas mileage.  (Note:  This is not necessarily true if you choose the extra cab.)

Space is tight, especially in a regular cab like mine.  But I always have enough room for myself and a friend, plus a few odds and ends stowed behind the seats.

The 4x4 Tacoma is perfect for someone who loves the outdoors, and wants a vehicle that can go down anything that could be called a &quot;road.&quot;  Think twice if you have either kids or things that you don't want to carry in the bed.  If you have no plans of leaving graveled roads, the 4x4 Tacoma is probably overkill.  And if you're only real concern is snow, you can probably get by with a car.

But if you're like me - single, no kids, and in need of a commuting vehicle that can get you out and about on the weekends - the Tacoma may be your perfect choice.<br><br>
