            We bought our Cadillac Escalade about a week ago, trading in our 1999 Chevrolet Suburban in, plus about $30,000. Although somewhat expensive, the Escalade provides the owner with a multitude of abilities, both exterior and interior. 

First of all, the acceleration on the 2002 Cadillac Escalade is 7.8 seconds. This is incredible for a 5,000 lb. machine. This feat is derived from a huge 6.0 liter V8, pumping out 345 bhp, and around 400 lbs. of torque. Despite the Escalade's incredible acceleration, the gas mileage on this vehicle takes a toll as a result. I average around 10 miles per gallon, but the manufacturer persists that it's around 15 miles per gallon. 

The styling of the 2002 Escalade is superb. The front grille on the vehicle makes this car stand out in any crowd. The back of the Escalade has the classic LED brake lights of many of Cadillac's vehicles, which are instantaneous lights, compared to other vehicle's brake lights which take about a (1/10) of a second to react after the driver mashes the brakes. Also, the trim on the interior of the Escalade is real mahogany wood on top of leather. There is more leather in this car than on a pasture of cows. The seat comfort of the Escalade is excellent. You could live in these seats. With adjustable lumbar, and available heated seats, they're hard to beat. 

The "status symbol effect" of this year's Escalade is also a bonus. For those of you who listen to rap music, you know that all the big names are always rapping about their cars, and the one car that stands out the most in almost every rap song is the Cadillac Escalade. 

In conclusion, the 2002 Cadillac Escalade is an excellent choice for upscale buyers looking for an upscale vehicle. The multitude of options the Escalade has are user-friendly, and with the available On-Star software, you're sure to be safe where ever you may be.
