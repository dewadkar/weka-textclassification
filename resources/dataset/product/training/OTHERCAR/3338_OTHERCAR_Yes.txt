               Well let me give you a little background info on my '91 Twin Turbo.  I bought it a couple months from my brother-in-law who was the original owner.  She only has 31,000 miles and is a real gem.  She has never seen snow and hardly ever sees rain.  
   She has a 3.0L V-6 at 60 degrees with twin turbos that unleash a hellaish 300HP in the blink of an eye.  She has all wheel drive as well as all wheel steering.  If you want a fast car without paying all the money for one than this is the car for you.  Twin Turbos in my book are " Stang-Eaters" or "Chevy-Killers" by far, but I'll let you make that decision for yourself.  
   Dodge has done a good job already making the car fast straight from production.  If you like there are several additional mods you can do fairly cheap to beef her up.  
   The only complaint I have for the car is that the stereo is mounted on the lower end of the center console. This  making it a bit difficult to reach, but you can still change stations and volume by the controls located on the steering wheel. 
   I am 6'5" 250Lbs. and still consider the car to have ample room for the driver and passenger.  As for the back seat I wouldn't consider sticking anyone back there for a long period of time.
   My advice to anyone looking for a great sports car is look at a Stealth R/T first.  If you think shes to fast for you take a step down to an "ES" model.  So what are you waiting for?  Get out there and treat yourself to something nice! Keep it safe and don't drink and drive- STEALTHMAN
