            <i>This review is a summary of our Lemon Law experiences with the <b>Dodge Caravan</b> and Chrysler.</i>


We purchased a 1998 Dodge Caravan mid 1998.  We made the purchase because we had our first child on the way and I wanted something safe and with a lot of room.  

After a few months we started having trouble with it.  Upon acceleration the minivan would "buck".  It was difficult to accelerate when getting on parkways.  The minivan would jolt, and I considered it to be very dangerous.   We brought the minivan back to the dealer 5 times and they never fixed the problem.  We had the fuel pumped replaced....still had the problem.  A computer "co-pilot" was installed to record the problem while driving....it detected the problem and we thought it would be fixed after that, but it wasn't.  The technician even took the minivan home with him and he experienced the problem too, but they were still not able to fix it.

The 5 times that the van went back to the dealer it was a big inconvenience for us.  We literally had to <i>beg</i> for a rental, and the car they wanted to give us was a GEO METRO.  That was a JOKE....and we had to pay for an upgrade to a larger, safer car.  Why would I put my son in such a small car?  I don't think that Chrysler handled the situation correctly.  I spent almost $20,000 for a van that spent a lot of time in the shop !!

In December 1999 we went through Lemon Law Arbitration.   Chrysler tried to settle our case by giving us $1,000 in "damages" and said that they would fix the van.....my question....<b>If they couldn't fix it before, why could they guarantee that they could fix it now?</b>   Justice was served and we won our case and took our refund and RAN !!  I would not suggest this vehicle to anyone, even though this may have been an isolated incident.  Would <i>you</i> want to take that risk?
