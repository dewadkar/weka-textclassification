                I currently drive a 94 Altima GXE. It's my baby. I love the car and it is solid and reliable. Acceleration is astonishing for a 4cyl., and handling is exceptional. Braking is top grade, providing a feel of safety and security. I find the style of the Nissan Altima, even though it's a 94 model, still an eye catching contemporary car in the auto field. This is usually a hard feat do accomplish, seeing how most cars will begin showing there age in five years. In fact in my personal opinon, i find the 93-97 Altima more stylish than the 98-01 Altima, (no offense). The interior is intimate, combining class with sensible functionality. The climate control system is extremely powerfull as well. And provides considerable trunk space. 
     However I find the pleasant to drive Altima can become unsettled quite easily over the slightest sewer drain, and it does have the tendency to let one know where every bump is in the road. Thigh support is lacking for a tall driver, (like myself), and the rear can be tight for three. Wind noise is another factor, when driving on highways. Unfourtantly the Altima does have one serious downfall, and that would be its electrical system. I'm not saying its bad because i don't treat it right or something, but the Altima cars tend to have a sour spot there in general. I can no longer retrieve a CD in the Stereo, and i must turn it up or down & change the stations by way of remote, (i have an aftermarket stereo, with adaptor, but even before that the factory stereo had problems.) It seems to be a shortage that occurs in that center console area. i've noticed if i step on the brakes, the digital clock will go off as pressure is applied.
     With all that said, i find the Altima a grade A choice for a vehicle. I am currently "customizing" my Altima GXE model to a GLE model you could say. Installing GLE rims rather than the plastic hubs, spoiler, fog lights, and looking a leather interior kit for it. I obviously love my car :-). Anyone who has an Altima and treats it right knows what i'm talking about.
