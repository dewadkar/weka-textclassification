            My wife and I were looking for a reliable new car and since I had a 1990 VW Golf with no problems, we decided to look for a new VW.

We decided to go with the new Jetta (99) and took one for a test drive.  Several days later we drove away with our new black with tan interior GL.  

We bought the car in late June and it ran nice until the winter.  The brakes on the car began to grind and groan.  At times I could tell that there was more to the normal wear and tear of breaking in a new car.  I went back to the dealer and they handed me a sheet of paper with directions for new brakes and what causes the sounds.  OK, I thought this will do, but what about the other noises.  The service department looked at the car and told me that there were some underbody screws loose and that they tightened them. Did not do the trick.

My wife and I went on a 4000 mile trip across the US and we took the Jetta.  When we where in the middle of the country, (we live in New England)we developed a leak from the drivers side door.  The leak sent water streaming down the door and into the top speaker.  We had to place a towel there for the trip.  Now this happened at high speeds like 70-75 on the trip.  When we got back, the leak continued even at slow speeds.

One option we should have got was the VW helmet.  When the car is placed into reverse there is a very uncomfortable jerk and your head goes flying back into the headrest.  Also when you are taking off the car jerks into gear and causes everyone in the car to respond &quot;whoa&quot;.  

I think that the car is OK overall, I don't know if are experience is uncommon or normal, but I have spoken to some people who have owned a new Jetta and they have had all the same trouble.   Some have told me that the onboard computer causes these problems.  I am unsure if I will buy another VW after this, and the shotty service I received from a full time VW dealer.

This is my Epinion damn it!
