            Overview of the Stealths:

The base model Dodge Stealth is slightly different than the R/T models. There are actually 4 different model Stealths put out by Dodge from 1991-1996. The Base Model with an SOHC 12V 3.0L, 163HP (sounds small), and close to 200ft. lbs. torque, it's a FWD. Then there is the ES model, which comes with a 24V DOHC motor, 225HP, and I don't remember the torque, it too is FWD. The base and ES models look the same, they don't come with the side vents, and two color paint job like the R/T models. There are two different R/T models. The first is basically the same as the ES model, with the same engine, but with the side air vents. The second R/T model is a beast. All Wheel Drive, All Wheel Steering, Bush Button Traction control, Active Exhaust (you can change it from coming out of two to four pipes), and finally twin turbos. The 3000GT VR4 model is the same as the R/T twin turbo except that the 3000GT model came with Active Aero, an adjustible spoiler that changes position at speeds above 50 MPH. This was only previously seen on high end Porsches. For more information on Stealths/3000s, go to www.3si.org


Advantages:
First off, these cars are beautiful! The base model comes with 15&quot; tires, stock ones being 205/65/15, which are somewhat tall and don't provide much traction. I replaced mine with 225/50/15, which are much more suited to this sports car. FWD is perfectly suited to snowy weather. The shocks are solid, and provides a great ride. The brakes are perfect, they stop on a dime easily. All Stealth models come standard with a leather wrapped steering wheel, which feels exceptionally comfortable. The seats are perfect, 6 way manual adjustable (power optional). The interior is set up perfectly, every gauge faces the driver, and you always know everything that is going on in your engine. The base model has only 163HP, but it feels like it's much faster. My car has an exceptionally peppy engine. Speeds of over 120 can easily be reached. My car has over 100,000 miles on it, and it still handles perfectly. Chicks dig the car! Nobody believes that it's 8 years old, the car ages well. It may seem like you couldn't fit anything in the back of the car, but I've fit anything from a Lazy Boy chair to a pressure washer in the back.

Disadvantages:
Probably the most expensive problem with the Stealths/3000s is the transmission problems. Only one or two companies actually rebuild the transmissions for a 3/S, and even then you'll have to wait around for three weeks while they do that. The dealer replaced mine under warranty about 40,000 miles ago. Visibility in the car is low, especially when backing up. The shifter boot for the manual transmission is bad. It's leather over cloth, and will shed off the leather rather easily. Better shifter boots are available for cheap, though. <br><br>
