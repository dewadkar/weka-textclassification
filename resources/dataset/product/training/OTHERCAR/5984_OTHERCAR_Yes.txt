            When shopping for a SUV there are several offerings in the Lux-ute category.  The BMW X5 (3.0i,4.0i,4.4i,4.6i), Mercedes ML (350,500,AMG55), Lexus RX 330, Porsche Cayenne (S,TT), Acura MDX, and the Lexus GX 470.  The Porsche is a tad bit pricey and extravagent (75k+), and although it drives like a dream, it is beyond the reach of most people. The Mercedes ML has THE WORST handling of any SUV ever.  EVER.  The Lexus GX is identical to the Toyota 4runner, a great car, but for the price there is no justification to purchase the car.  

Out of the remaining three, the BMW X5 offers the best ride, the RX 330 offers new techno-features, but the MDX is the most sensible blend of performance and luxury there is.

Priced at around $40k, it is easily the least expensive SUV out of the Lux-Ute group.  The Lexus RX offers a base price of 37k, but with options this number grows incredibly.  

You can get the MDX in two skins, the Standard, or with Navigation.  The main difference here is a DVD navigation system (I personally have NEVER found a use for these things as long as you have a good sense of direction) and a few extra toys to play with (nothing major).

I opted with the standard model, which comes with standard cd player, leather, heated front seats, 3rd row seating, heated mirrors, automatic seats, and sunroof.  These features are options on any other make of car and will run an extra $8k minimum on the base price.  The only options are truly the 6cd changer, driver's seat with memory, roofrack and running boards.  I opted to add on the roofrack and the running boards.

Seating inside the vehicle is spacious, as every passenger has plenty of room, except for in the 3rd row seat, but I would never sit back there.  With all the seats folded down you can easily go to the Home Depot and put in whatever you purchase in the car.  The ride is equally smooth, yet the handling was surprisingly good for a SUV.  Road noise is a little more evident in this SUV than others because of a tight suspension, but to be able to corner turns like a normal sedan is well appreciated.

Acceleration is smooth, although the drive by wire throttle system takes some getting used to.  Brakes are solid and respond well, even in the rain.  Gas mileage was disappointing, as the best mileage I got was 14/19 even with my best driving efforts.

Note that this is a great SUV to drive around town and take on a ski trip, this IS NOT a vehicle for offroading.  I decided to take this vehicle offroad and it got stuck, warranting the police to come and tow the car out (how embarassing) and issue a disorderly persons charge.  The vehicle stability systems are great for driving on road, but cannot be disengaged properly off road and lowers performance.  

All in all though, if you want to have a good all around SUV without breaking the bank, go with the MDX.
