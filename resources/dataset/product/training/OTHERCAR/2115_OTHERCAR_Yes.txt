            Before buying a new truck... I took the time to shop all Full Size Trucks...
Dodge with there great looks... But the ride was less then fair... Interior room on the Ext cab limited and dash & components seemed cheap..
Ford.. The leader in sales... Was even less desirable then the Dodge for ride.. Even a smaller Ext cab.
GMC walked away from all of them.. Good styling, 4 door Ext Cab. Loads of interior room. Fair ride.. Good gas mileage.. and tops the resale after 5 years...
Cheverolet (GMCs Sister)... Just a step lower in options then the GMC..
