            The PCD-640 is a fairly good value for the money it costs.  I found it at a Wal-Mart during the post-thanksgiving sale for an extremely reasonable price of $99.00  The only drawback i can see is that the kit i purchased didn't come with the floppy adapter, which would make the two meg flash card the only card ever needed.  It accepts up to 8 meg flash cards, which would be about the equivalent of 10 rolls of film.  Overall the quality of the photographs is better than expected.  One other thing that's worthy of mention is that if you purchase this camera, keep a good supply of AA batteries handy.  The product takes 4 of 'em, and it tends to eat 'em fairly quickly.<br><br>
