            If you are one of these 35 mm film-camera users who trust their point-and-shoot features so much, here is something you might be interested in.  <b>The Fuji FinePix S602 Digital Camera</b> is the type of digital cameras that will help you make a smooth transition.  This year, based on the number of requests, inquiries and purchases at my local electronic store where I am a consultant, I will say that digital cameras have successfully crossed over.  By the end of this year, they will have outsold the perennial 35 mm film cameras we all have come to appreciate over the years.  What's important to know is that you will be able to find most of the 35 mm film cameras incorporated into this digital camera.  If you are still looking for a good present for your loved one or you just want to take the leap to the digital photography revolution, just keep reading.  Our hope is that you will use the following information to make up your mind.  

<b>What should you look forward to in the Fuji FinePix S602?</b>

If this is going to be your first digital camera, I will just assume you are not too familiar with digital imaging.  Allow me to have this assumption because I want to point out that any two-megapixel and three-megapixel digital cameras you end up buying will get the job done.  After all, most digital camera users or owners use their cameras to take pictures to e-mail to friends, post to the web and sell online or in auctions.  Very rarely will you need to have prints of these pictures.  But if you choose to have them, this camera can take pictures you can enlarge to 8 1/2 by 11 inches.  Even a 1-MP digital camera is sufficient to meet your needs.  What you need to bear in mind is that Camera manufacturers tend to push megapixels the way PC makers push processor speed.  Having said, we must ask ourselves the following question:  
<i>Where does the Fuji FinePix S602 Digital Camera fit?</i>

This FinePix S602 will take great pictures.  It features a 6X optical zoom.  Just like with your 35 mm, you will be able to zoom and focus by adjusting the lens manually.  Furthermore, on-screen menus will let you adjust settings electronically too.  What's the value of the <b>6X optical zoom?</b>

The ads on digital cameras you have come in contact with may have put lots of emphasis on two types of zoom.  Optical and digital zoom.  Optical zoom is more important that digital zoom which has the effect of only blowing up the image and then cropping it, thereby reducing both resolution and quality.  It makes sense to start with higher-resolution images when you start editing.  Optical zoom in digital cameras is like zooming in a film camera.  As a feature of the lens, the optical zoom helps preserve the resolution and quality of the images.  While the Fuji FinePix S602 may not be the well-touted <b>Nikon CoolPix 5700 Digital Camera, or even any of the 4-or 5-Megapixel new cameras on the market right now.</b>  Thanks its large optical zoom, I can tell you that this point-and-shoot is a very decent camera to invest in.  In addition, you will enjoy the controls this camera comes equipped with.  They are pretty easy to use.  In many ways, they are similar to those found in the 35 mm film cameras.  I have found the instructions to be straight to the point.  The software has interesting features you will be able to use to edit, crop, and add light to your images. A lot of photography buffs like playing around with their toys.  This camera allows them to set man
