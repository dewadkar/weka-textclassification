            When I took my daughter car-shopping for the first time, I knew it would be tough.  It was her first car, it was my first time buying a car for my child.  I wasn't very optimistic:  her wants (something fast, sporty, big enough for all her friends, and preferrably convertible) did not match my wants (something safe, reliable, and fairly inexpensive).

However, when we came across the white '96 Kia Sephia, we both fell in love.  Although four years old, the car's original factory brakes and tires were in excellent condition (and still are).  The steering was not too tight or too loose, giving my daughter perfect control of the car.  It came equipped with an air conditioner/heater that cools and heats the entire car in little time, even in extreme conditions. The car also came with an adequate factory amfm/cass radio and driver/passenger air bags. I have driven the car many times since we bought it, and I find the ride smooth and clean.  There is plenty of foot and head room up front, though the backseat is a little tight around the leg area.  The trunk is huge when compared with economy cars in its class; the space is more like my Lincoln Continental than my son's Chevy Cavalier.

My daughter has had her car for six months and so far there have been no complaints (a surprise to me, after reading the terrible reviews Kia received in auto trader magazines).  The car is small, but big enough that I'm confident she won't get completely crunched if she gets in an accident.  We have had two routine checkups and all parts are in great condition.  The car gets excellent gas mileage (the tank is full at $10 and gets about 30 mpg).  I recommend this car for anyone who is looking for an inexpensive yet efficient and good-looking sport sedan, with plenty of room and safety options.<br><br>
