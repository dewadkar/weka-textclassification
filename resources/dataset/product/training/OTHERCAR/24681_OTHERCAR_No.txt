            We own a 1997 Chevrolet Venture with now 28,500 miles. We love the van but hate some of the things that we have had to deal with owning it . The brakes have been some of the biggest problems . The back drums were replaced at 12,000 miles because of being out of round and leaking brake fluid. The front disc brakes have been looked at numerous times and told the noise was just common until we took it in at 25,000 miles and now the noise is because it must need new pads. The compartment for the jack has filled up with so much water when it rains that the only remedy the dealer had was to drill a 1/2 inch hole in the frame to prevent water from sitting . We also have a 1994 lumina van which is the older sister of the Venture and have never experience these type of problems before. The rear hatch came open several time while driving down the road and at one point came open when entering the garage which broke the rear window costing me $250 to replace.<br><br>
