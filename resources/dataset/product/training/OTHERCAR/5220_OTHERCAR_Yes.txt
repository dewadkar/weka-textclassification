            I bought this camera last summer after having wanted a digital camera for quite some time.  I saw this one at Sears and happened to also have about $40 in coupons so I went for it.  I mostly use it to take pictures of stuff for online auctions as well as easily share personal pics on the web.

This camera is easy to learn.  At first it seems a little complicated but I picked it up really fast.  I can get about 15 pictures if I use the 728x1024 resolution and 32 if I use the 480x640.  Mine came with a 1mb SmartMeida disk.  You can purchase larger ones if you desire to be able to take more pictures.

Getting the pictures to the computer was a bit of a pain until I got the SmartDrive disk.  (I got this for free but had to send in a rebate and wait 8 weeks for it to arrive in the mail.)  This disk allows me to put my SmartMedia inside it, then insert the SmartDrive disk into the A drive of the computer and then read the files as if on any floppy.  The other method is to connect the camera to the computer via a serial port and then import the pictures into the included software.  Then they had to be saved to disk.

When taking pictures, you can look through the view finder as with a conventional camera, or you can have what is viewed appear on the LCD screen.  If you are using the latter method, you will use more battery life but you will also be able to use a &quot;mock&quot; 1.6x zoom.  And any and all pictures you take either way can be viewed again and again on the LCD screen.  This is very fun for kids!

I am really glad I got this camera.  It had the best features in the price range and I have been very happy with the quality of the pictures.  I use Renewal Rechargeable batteries in this even though the manual warns not to use anything but Fuji's special battery if using rechargeables.  I didn't want to spend $100 for their batteries so I am risking it.<br><br>
