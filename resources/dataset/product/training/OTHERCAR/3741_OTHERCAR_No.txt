            I purchased a 2000 Chevy Silverado 4x4 5-speed mainly for driving on country roads.I am split 50/50 on this vehicle.

Some of the things that I do enjoy in this truck are:the stereo.. for a factory stereo and speakers, I am impressed. The seats: very comfortable,makes for an enjoyable trip .The look:the overall look of this truck is very sharp and stylish, I give this a thumbs up.

 However the things that really concern me in regards to this 4x4 are: the rotors are exposed, so when you drive on gravel, rocks get between the pads and rotors causing groves,I have less than 10,000 kilometers on it, and the groves are quite noticeable.Another concern is in regards to the noise and the lack of smoothness in the shifting from first into second, I prefer a nice smooth shift rather than a clunk and jerk.

 My overall view on this truck is that it is  nice to look at but a bit of a disappointment.<br><br>
