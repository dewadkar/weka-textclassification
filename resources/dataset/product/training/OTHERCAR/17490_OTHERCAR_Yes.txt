            I had an absolutely terrible, terrible experience with the two dealers that tried to sell me this van.  So much so that I turned the first dealer in to my state's consumer affairs division, attorney general and the local news.  I am so glad I didn't let the Ford and Chrysler dealer's complete idiocy sour me on the best vehicle I ever owned.   

I have about 17,000 miles on the Sedona so far and it runs great.  The engine power is fantastic.  The handling is very nice for such a large vehicle.  The leather seats remind me of my Dad's old Cadillac.  The two zone heating and cooling is fast and more than competent.  The braking and accelleration are great.  The CD player and audio system is awesome.  I love the two tone paint scheme.  I have blue with tan and tan leather interior.  I really regret not going for the sunroof - the only option avail at the time I didn't get.  The large wheels and tires have held up well against NJ and NY City gaping potholes.  It handled amazingly well this winter in the snow.  The double sliding doors are fantastic and easy to handle.  The rear power venting windows are wonderful for ventilation and are so cool to open and close.  There's still room behind the last row of seats to fit a baby stroller and a couple of bags of groceries.  The carpet and carpet protector that comes with it are amazing and lush.  My only complaint with this van is that I find the seats sometimes difficult to lock back in.  BUT, in comparison to my experience with Chrysler and Ford products these seats are much easier to handle.
