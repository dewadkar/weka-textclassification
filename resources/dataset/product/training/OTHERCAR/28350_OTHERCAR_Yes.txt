            Do you want a "status" symbol like a Lincoln but love the look of sporty, European luxury imports?  Then I must say... the Lincoln LS may be your perfect match!  It also helps that this little Lincoln costs exceptionally less than my favorite... the Town Car.

I work for a luxury car dealership, so I get to test drive many cars.  The LS is one of my favorites.


<b>SPECIFICATIONS</b>:
This car is rear-wheel drive and has 4 doors. It measures a touch over 16 feet long, so it is relatively small - 2 feet shorter than the Town Car.

It is available in a V6 (LS6) or V8 (LS8), the car I drove was an LS8.  The LS6 has a 3.0-liter, 24-valve V6 powertrain with a 5-speed manual or automatic transmission. The LS8 has a 3.9-liter, DOHC, 32-valve V6 powertrain with a 5-speed automatic transmission.  Both models have 4-wheel disc brakes.

Gas mileage is 18mpg city, 25mpg highway.


<b>COMFORT</b>:
I feel very comfortable driving this car.  The seat felt tailor-made, everything is within an arm's reach.  Due to the arched roofline, the head-room is generous.  

And as far as passenger comfort is concerned, knee-room is comparable to that of the BMW 5-series - a good amount for a luxury sports sedan.


<b>FEATURES</b>:
Optional features on the Lincoln LS include Advance Trac, Power Moonroof, Heated Seats, 6-disc changer and several others that are pretty common optional features. 

The Convenience Package is a popular choice.  It includes a universal garage door opener, moisture sensing windshield wipers and driver seat memory.

The Sport Package is a wonderful option... it includes an Alpine sport audio system with 6-disc changer, European handling suspension with 17" all-season tires with 17" 5-spoke brushed aluminum wheels, SelectShift and a 16" spare.

If you are like me, a moonroof is a "must have" in your cars.  The MSRP of a moonroof in this car is $1,005 - a feature I would not think twice about getting.  However, one very noticeable thing I noticed about this moonroof is the disappointing size.  It measures approximately 11" inward and would be over 13" if it weren't for that darn sliding door.  If you have that sliding door removed, the size is average.  But even with the sliding door, it is a feature that makes any car more luxurious and fun to drive in.  I'll never buy a car without one!

If you know LS's well, you may know that 5-spoke wheels indicate that this car is an LS8, as LS6s have 9-spoke wheels.  These sporty 16" high-polished aluminum wheels add that bit of ritz to the car.  The model I examined had 215/60VR-16 tires.  However, 17" wheels are an option.

The Lincoln-distinct radiator grille gives the car such awesome visual stimulation... as it does on the Lincoln Navigator and Town Car (Continental grille is not as gorgeous).  The grille along with the European sporty body of the LS make for one beautiful car.

One thing worth mentioning about this car is the optional heated seats.  The LS only has a heated seat <b>bottom</b>, whereas the Town Car, Continental and Navigator have heated seats and seat backs.  When I hear "heated seats" I expect the ENTIRE seat to be heated.  This is a feature that better be worth the extra money.  Just a disappointment I noticed and thought I would bring to your attention.

This car also has the common amenities such as wood trim on the console, dashboard and all four doors; seat heaters; heat registers for rear passengers; door pockets; a trip computer; adjustable seatbelt anchors; and a center rear seatbelt.  With luxurious standard features such as: leather seats with lumbar adjustment, fog lamps, front and side air-bags, dual climate control and more.

 
<b>YOUR CUSTOM CAR</b>:
You can custom order your LS in one of eleven gorgeous colors: Light Parchment Gold, Autumn Red, Pearl Blue, Aqua Blue, Midnight Grey, Black, Medium Charcoal Green, Medium Cypress Green, Ivory Parchment, White Pearlescent and my new favorite... Silver Frost.  Vibrant White was the my favorite color of the 2000 LS... but it was discontinued and not available for the 2001 LS.  

You can choose from four interior leather choices: Medium Parchment (tan), Truffle, Deep Charcoal and Light Graphite.

Might I recommend a fabulous color scheme?  A Silver Frost exterior with Light Graphite interior looks Smokin!  So classy, clean and hot!  I think Medium Cypress Green is a shame to the car... it is ugly.  But whatever you choose, I am sure you'll love this car!


<b>GENERAL INFORMATION</b>:
James O'Sullivan, Lincoln's group brand manager confirms that the primary "luxury sport" (including the LS) buyers range in age from 30 to almost 50. 

The competitors of the Lincoln LS include the BMW 3-series, the Lexus ES300 and the Mercedes C-class - all priced in the low-$30,000 range.  However, the avid car researcher may note that the Lincoln LS is more closely matched as far as size and specifications are concerned with the Mercedes E-class, BMW 5-series and Lexus GSs.

The LS is well known for its near 50-50 front-to-rear weight distribution.  A great feature achieved by using aluminum in the front fender, hood, and trunk-lid as well as housing the battery in the trunk.

<b>RECOMMENDATION</b>:
I LOVE Lincoln cars.  The fact that many Lincoln customers are repeat buyers also says a lot.  And working at a dealership, I see what types of cars that are serviced frequently and Lincoln's are not among them.  They are virtually maintenance-free for years (not including necessary upkeep such as oil changes, etc).  They are reliable, durable and on top of it all - fabulous looking cars!!  

I would highly recommend the Lincoln LS, whether you choose the LS6 or the LS8...I know you'll be surprised when you feel how it drives and even more surprised when you see the price tag.
