            I purchased my second Saturn SL1 after having the first one for 2.5 years.  I had never owned a new car and purchased the first Saturn SL1 after shopping all the major dealerships in our area.  I was appalled at how the car salespeople treated me as a customer; they really did want to tell me about the stereo and the makeup mirror, but not the guts of the car.

I liked the Saturn sales philosophy.  No gimmicks, no pressure, price is on the window.  I drove my Saturn home that day.  I loved my new car and got about 40 MPH in the first one.  I purchased a basic 5-speed with A/C and AM/FM Cassette package...no frills.  I took this Saturn to the dealership for service every 3K miles.  I had the basic 36K mile warranty which is included in the purchase price, and very few things needed to be repaired under warranty.  But, the warranty covered even small stuff like a broken plastic fin on the A/C vent.

I purchased my second Saturn after my first went out of warranty, and I had 45K miles on it.  Again, I shopped for other compact cars, and was completely put off by the salespeople.  I went back to Saturn and received the full Kelley Blue Book trade-in for my old Saturn.

The only problems I have with my Saturn are its size.  It is very definitely a compact car, with a tiny back seat.  The front seat is big enough, but wouldn't be called roomy.  The engine in the 1997 was noisy because the driver sits right behind the firewall which was not very insulated in that model.  However, my 1999 is more quiet due to improvements in sound insulation.  I get lower gas mileage in the 1999, only 30 MPH, but still respectable.

The Saturn SL1 is a great first car or extra car for a family.  It has also been rated very well in crash tests.  I would feel safe having one of my teenagers driving a Saturn, and a family can usually afford the payment.  It would not be a good car for exceptionally tall or large people, they would be cramped.  It is also not a good car for someone expecting to drive a race car, it has a small engine and not a lot of get up and go.<br><br>
