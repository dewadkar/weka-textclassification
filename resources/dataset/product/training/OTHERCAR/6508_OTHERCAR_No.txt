            We've owned this camera for just under two years.  It had been great for us.  Pic quality was good.  And with a a 128 meg card in it, we could get over 190, full resolution, pictures.   We even had some great 8x10's printed from it.  And you can't tell it was from a Digital.

One problem with a 2.3 mp is that you can't crop and zoom pictures.  as soon as you do, resolution drops big time!  Yet, if your shot is good to begin with you're set.  

The docking station makes it easy to plug into the computer.  Downloading is a breeze, even without the software.

About 3 months ago we notice the camera started acting funny.  It would "reboot" all the time.  It was quite annoying.  But it was still use-able.  Just had to be patient.    I called Kodak and we tried several options to get it to work correctly... cycle the battery, get a new battery, upgrade the firmware.   All done with no luck.

So, then I call Kodak again and am told I will have to pay $150   $10.95 (shipping)   tax to get it fixed.  Whoa!  I thought they'd at least look at first, tell me what's wrong, and quote me a price for repair.   Well, for $160 , that's a nice payment towards a new camera.   So, we are shopping.  And guess what, we'll never buy Kodak again.   Yes, customer service was courtious and helpful, but the repair department is crazy if they think I'm going to pay that much to fix a camera that cost only $100 more.  I can get a higher MP for about the same money, but new.

So, I am less than pleased.  What is interesting is my wife looked on ebay today for our DX3600 and found several people selling theirs with the same problem....  real cheap, just gotta spend $150 to get it fixed.   ...Sigh...
