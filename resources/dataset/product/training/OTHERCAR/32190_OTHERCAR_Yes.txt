            When I started looking for an economical replacement for the GM product that I owned, I was favorably impressed by the Chevrolet Cavalier.  The model that I fell in love with was the &quot;rag top&quot;.  Despite some problems, the amount of room in the back seat for adults, the problems with the power windows, and a few other minor fit and finish problems, this car is just plain fun.... I highly recommend the 5 speed manual transmission, and the CD player.  Unfortunately the sound in the back seat is not especially good.  Power seats would have been a nice option.  Overall for good reliable fun transportation this car does it all.  the 1999 Chevy Cavalier is a good investment.<br><br>
