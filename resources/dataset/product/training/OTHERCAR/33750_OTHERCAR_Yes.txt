            We own a '95 Nissan Maxima and let me tell tell you...It's is a lot of fun to own!  I'm not an expert on all of the particulars, I'm just a regular driver of one.  I don't know exact gas mileage, but I can tell you that it gets alot!!  I can almost 200 miles on 1 tank of gas!  To me that is great economical mileage!!  The get up and go is great.  It can go 0-60 in 1 minute, not that I have done that alot, but I have played!  The bose stereo system is a plus.  I have cassette and CD usage, with a great sound.  The leather seats are great, and when the car gets to right temperature in winter, it evens itself out, and turns itself down.  

I am really glad that I made the decision to go with my 95 Maxima.  I plan on keeping this car for a long time, until it decides to peter itself out. Oh yeah, it makes a great family car too!!<br><br>
