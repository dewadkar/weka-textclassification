            If you are looking for a camera you must have your lists (or your head) filled with numbers and figures. This is why the following review will make little use of numerical figures (which you can get at many other sites anyway ala dpreview.com) and concentrate on the bottom line: Is this a good buy, are there better competitors out there?
I had the S300 for a year now and took around 1000 pictures with it. It still looks as new as in the day I bought it.
I think there is a consensus as to the built of the camera. It size also served as a plus since you can always carry it around. If you are looking for a big SLR-size camera with lots of manual controls, the S300 is not for you.
I hear people complaining about the 8MB CF card the camera comes with. Let me tell you this: regardless of the camera you buy you will ALWAYS have to buy more memory (unless you buy it in a 'pro' package that supplies the extra memory with the unavoidable extra cost...) I bought 128MB card with PCMCIA card reader for an extra $70. And guess what- I lived to tell about it.
Regarding battery life and charge: The camera comes with an external charger, which might seem as a drawback, but I believe that to carry a plug with a cable will be the same hassle as carrying a small wall charger. Battery life is good even with the original battery supplied.
So why wouldn't you buy the S300? Here are things to consider:
A. Price: You can get other cameras with the same features for less money.
B. Alternatives: You can get the Canon S110 which has everything but the 3x optical, the Olympus cameras which are very good and probably some others.
C. You need a professional photos with ISO control, dark lightning, macro and manual zoom: In this case I recommend moving to another camera criteria, probably with a bigger lens.
Using these three bullets I decided to go for the S300. I have an SLR camera for professional photos I need from time to time, so the S300 was for everyday photos. The size was very important and I wanted to go with a camera that has at least 3x optical zoom (btw- you can disregard any digital zoom from a camera specs)
I tested the following alternatives: Fuji 4700z, Olympus D490Z, Sony DSC-P1, Canon A20. I still believe the S300 was the best buy.
IMPORTANT NOTE: A new camera is out now the Canon S330. I didn't test it, but you should look into it, since it seems a better buy today than the S300.
