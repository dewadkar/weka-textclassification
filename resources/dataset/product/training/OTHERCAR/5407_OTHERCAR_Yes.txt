            This camera is great. It fits in my hands perfectly, it's very comfortable, and very easy to use. When I was first looking around for digital cameras, I was sort of apprehensive at first because of all these terms like &quot;aperture size&quot; and &quot;shutter speed&quot;, but the Canon Powershot pro70 does everything automatically for me and does it very well. That is why I bought this camera. The shots I took came out very well with some blurry ones (I still don't have the flash unit yet) under available light. I would recommend this camera to anybody...

Get it!  This is the best camera I have seen in a while, and it is great.  I doesn't break, never has bad quality, and the zoom features on it are great!!!  I definational suggest this product!<br><br>
