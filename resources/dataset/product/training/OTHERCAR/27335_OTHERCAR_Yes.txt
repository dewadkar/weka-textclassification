            The Dodge Durango has got to be one of the most useful vehicles available today.  With the third seat, 4WD, towing capacity, luxurious interior, etc., I've never been happier with an auto purchase.  Mine is a 2000 model with 4.7 V8, leather interior, SLT package.  The Durango has a firm but comfortable ride.  I love the ability to have a third row seat or quickly fold it down for mucho cargo capacity.  The 4WD shifter operates smoothly.  The gas mileage (about 16 mpg) is good for a vehicle this size.  It has plenty of power with the small V8.  Towing capacity is excellent.  The Durango is GOOD looking.  What's not to like?  Also, NO maintenance problems so far and the Durango feels rock solid.  After owning this vehicle for a while, it's easy to see why SUVs are getting to be so popular.<br><br>
