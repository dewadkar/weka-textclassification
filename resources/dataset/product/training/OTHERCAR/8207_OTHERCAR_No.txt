            After my recent surgery then car wreck with this model Hyundai, I decided I should delete and re-write my review on this vehicle.  Not only was the car �nickel and diming� me to death this past year, I felt I should warn the public about another defect that could not be fixed on this car which nearly caused my death.  Had the accident been ten minutes later, my children would have been in the car.

Anyhow, I was still recovering from my peritonitis surgery of about two weeks and was working from home so my pay wouldn�t be cut off.  As the time came to pick up my children from the babysitter (about a mile from where we live), I got into my 1996 Hyundai Accent to go pick them up.  I had already sunk $1000 into this car at mid year just to keep the klunker going.  I had not gone very far down the main road when I had to stop for cars stopped in the road (at least two, possibly three, in front of me).  

I proceeded to brake, and to my horror, there were no brakes!  I had already had the brakes looked at and one replaced already because I had noticed it sometimes took longer to brake than normal and braking would make my body move forward during the procedure.  However, no repairman, Hyundai or brake specialist, could find anything wrong with the brakes.  When I needed them most, I did not have them.  Another defect of some sort?  Probably.

One of my best friends had just bought a new Hyundai Accent for her step-son this year.  Although it has an intermittent starting problem, no mechanic can figure out what is causing it.  It was like this with my brakes.

I was going 30 mph, 5 miles under the speed limit, and when I realized I was not stopping, I pushed the brake pedal all the way to the floor� still no brakes.  I did not have any more time to react than that.  I slammed into the car in front of me.  The impact was enough to jolt me badly, but the impact of the air bags was the most horrible thing I have ever experienced with any impact.

The air bag knocked me with such force, it knocked my glasses I was wearing into the back seat.  Fortunately, they were safety glasses with the side shields removed, so they were tougher frames than normal.  I felt like my nose had been broken.

Gases from the air bags poured into the car filling the cab.  I felt like I was choking and there was no air.  I might have been knocked unconscious had it not been for the gases cutting off my air.  The cabin was so filled with smoke that I thought my car was on fire.  I scrambled to get out yet my door wouldn�t open all the way.

One passerby kept shoving me back inside, and I wanted to punch her out or drag her in so she could get a whiff of what I was breathing.  

My windshield might have been saved had it not been for the passenger side air bag.  The force of it coming out broke it.  My poor car was totaled at 30 mph yet the other car was not badly damaged at all and was not even nudged into the stopped car in front of her.  There were not even skid marks from all the breaking I tried to do.  The car just would not stop.

I just wanted to warn the consumers out there that this is not a safe car nor is it a good quality vehicle.  This was my second try at Hyundai giving them the benefit of the doubt, and it could have cost me my life or my children�s lives.  A cheap price tag is NOT worth that.  You really do get what you pay for in a Hyundai.
 
I have owned two Hyundai, one a 1990 Excel, the other a 1996 Accent, and I have had two totally different yet similar experiences with the cars.  

The Excel was the more disaster of the two I thought until this yet, and although Hyundai does not manufacture these vehicles anymore, I would not recommend buying a used one.  They are dangerous.  My 1990 Hyundai was the leakiest car I had ever owned.  I had a constant oil leak (yes, even from the time it was new), and at 48,000, the catalytic converter stopped up and ruined a honeymoon I was on because we were stranded for FOUR days trying to find a mechanic that could work on a Hyundai.  To make matters worse, we were out of state.

The 1990 Excel version also had a problem with the master cylinders leaking, therefore causing other major problems.  The symptoms were:  slow and sluggish shifting because the �clutch fluid� was leaking.  This special fluid was actually my break fluid!  It is tied into the same reservoir and when it began to leak, the shifting locked up, and I lost my breaks at the same time!  I was at one of the busiest intersections of Springdale, AR when this happened.  I was two months pregnant and eventually had to push the dead machine out of the street.  I was not happy.

After throwing away that piece of junk, due to financial embarrassment, I purchased a 1996 Hyundai Accent at the end of 1995. 

<b>1996 Hyundai Accent Features:</b>

This is what is on my particular Hyundai Accent:

* Moonroof
* Dual Cup Holder
* AM/FM Cassette Radio
* Dual Air Bags (includes Front Passenger Side)
* Power Steering
* Child Safety Locks in Back Seat
* Child Seat Accommodations (in a package to help secure car seats)
* Child Safety Back Windows (they do not roll down all the way, this can be a minus too)
* Power Brakes (don�t hit too hard or they�ll lock up on you)
* Speakers in the front doors (they only work intermittently�rarely work at all)

Within the first 3,000 miles, my check engine light came on.  I promptly took the car into the dealer since it had a 60,000 mile/3 year warranty.  As it turned out, my Power Steering Rack was leaking.  The repairmen said it was a $1,200 part and they needed  to get their Regional Manager to authorize such a repair.  What a crock, I thought!  If this is endangering my life or my child�s life, there�s going to be hell to pay.

After what seemed several weeks (I think it was five weeks) being on the phone with the repairmen trying to get authorization from some <b>�phantom regional manager�</b>, one evening a Hyundai quality check person called me to do a quick survey.  This is one thing I have noticed that both times I have purchased a Hyundai, they do call-backs to see how everything is going and if you had any problems.  I�ve never known another car manufacturer to do that.

I told the Hyundai lady that I was being given the run-around on a warranty repair, and she did not seem happy.  She took down all the details I gave her and said she would take care of that.  Within that same week, I received a call from the dealer�s repair shop saying I had authorization to get the car a new power steering rack.  I have to give it to the higher ups for  calling at the right time.  Thank you, Hyundai!  Otherwise, I would have been stuck with either a huge repair then or later� or worse, been a statistic of a faulty vehicle.

Around 7,000 miles, the check engine light once again came on.  I promptly called the dealership in their repair department (mind you, this was only nine or ten months since I bought the car), and they informed me that they no longer own the Hyundai dealership.  The repairman said they were also no longer servicing any Hyundai unless, of course, it was one of their own people that had bought one.  It did not matter that I had bought the car there and that it was still in warranty.

Let me tell you a little something about this dealership.  They are in Rogers, AR and sell BMW�s,  GMC�s, and Scouts.  I have seen these repairman sitting around playing cards (they immediately scatter and try to look busy when I walk in) and then charge $60/hour whether the repair was 10 or 15 minutes.  They have been rude numerous times.  I will never buy a vehicle from this dealership again, and I would not trust their repair shop either because they overcharge.  I once took my car in for a battery change.  When I tried to drive it off, it would die on my constantly!  They did something to it so I had to go back and have it fixed again.  This dealership will rip you off!

Back to my story, my check engine light is still on since it has never been taken back to any dealership for analysis.  After the Rogers dealership sold the Hyundai business, there was no dealership within  20 miles to take my car in for repairs.  The closest dealership I had found was in Ft. Smith, AR (at that time the new By Pass was not available, and I would have to risk driving it through the Boston Mountains) or the next closest, Tulsa, OK.

I even tried to take the car in to a foreign car garage; however, they did not have the 1996 Accent�s �program� to even test my car.  Therefore, he could not troubleshoot my car�s problem.  I have taken this car into Precision Tune for diagnostics, and they too did not that the 1996 Accent�s �program�.  All the technicians could trace the problem to from a book they had read was that the computer failed something three times before the light came on.  He said it should be something to do with the emission.  Once the battery is disconnected, it resets the computer; however, once this problems fails the check from the computer three times, it again comes on.  

I thought about buying a roll of black tape and just placing a piece over the dash board so the yellow light would not distract me so much.  But by now, I am so use to it, I think I would be lonely without it.

Now, there is a dealership in Fayetteville, AR; however, I have not had the money to take it in.  Plus I do not have a second car to drive to work and allow them to leave a job unfinished.  I need my car fixed within the same day I take it in.

Oh, yes, about the power steering rack, the Hyundai repairmen replaced in Rogers, AR.  It messed up my alignment, and I go through tires like crazy.  No one has ever been able to align the car.  I sometimes feel it is because I am a woman that I am treated like this and am having to keep an eye out for repairmen trying to pull a fast one on me.

Do mechanics go to school and learn this deceptive behavior?  Are they not smart enough to realize that we figure that tactic out and word of mouth goes a long way?  Eventually, they are cutting their own throats.

Back to this disastrous buy.  My rear window defroster mysteriously cracked (I can see the break in it which disconnects the circuit), and I am still wondering if it were from poor quality or my son doing something to it.  He gave me doe eyes when I asked him about it.

You must do all preventive maintenance on this type of car.  Trust me.  Change the fuel filter every two years (you may have to order this off the internet like I have done twice since it�s a dealer part and normal repair shops cannot get it).  Get your oil changes regularly.  Keep the tires rotated and balanced (hopefully you won�t have to have YOUR power steering rack replaced and totally screw up your alignment to where no one can fix it.  Tires are expensive.).

The car gets 30 �40 miles per gallon (mine is a standard transmission) depending if it is highway or in-town driving.  The car handles turns really well and the brakes are lousy as I found out from my wreck.  Sometimes the brakes lock up if used suddenly, so I try to keep a good distance between the person in front of me and myself.  This is NOT a good car for a habitual tailgater.  It�s even worse for a person that needs to stop and for some reason it just won�t.  This car is dangerous.

I have ran the battery down several times since it does not have a feature that shuts off your lights after a certain amount of time.  The main lights shut off, but the running lights do not.  Within two hours the running lights finish off my battery, and I have to try to find someone to give me a jump.  If you go to work in the semi-dark and are forgetful about turning off your lights, make sure you carry jumper cables in your trunk.  It has been my experience that it is simple to find someone to give you the needed jump but difficult to find the jumper cables!

All in all, I would NOT even buy this car again if I were desperate.  It was a nightmare from the beginning (unnecessary problems with parts are warranty replacements), and it had a bad ending with me almost dying.  I am still messed up a month later after the wreck.  My neck cracks and is extremely sore when I slightly even turn it.  My four smaller toes on my right foot are still jammed from trying to stop a non-braking car.  I still have the bruises from the seat beats which fortunately DID work when needed (I could do without the air bags!).  And finally, I  have chemical burn scars from the air bags scorching my arms.  I would not drive this brand of vehicle even if it were free.  My family is worth more than that, and I hope yours is too.
