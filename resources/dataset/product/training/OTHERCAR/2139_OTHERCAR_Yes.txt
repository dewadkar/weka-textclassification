            I have received a slightly used Golf 2000 Turbo diesel 115HP with a manual 6 gearbox as a company car for three months. Nearly all my colleagues were drooling of envy. Well, I must say I wasn't impressed at all. 
The quality of the Golf lies mostly in the very good assembly quality of the mechanic and interior part, however, the general architecture of the car doesn't seem to be made for this kind of overpowered engine. 
The 6 speeds are quite a fake, it's mainly a 5-speed gearbox extended to 6 with no real parallel to the power provided by the engine, a merely 5 hp more than the classical 110hp model with 5 speed. 
The car has a terrible tendency to stall at 3rd gear as the accelerator gets a faster response than the clutch, which doesn't seem to have been adapted for a sport use. On the other hand the mechanical precision of the gearbox is excellent compared to other cars of this kind, even to other Golf models, just a bit down the pricelist. 
The other great defect of this car is its very poor stability compared to the power available. It seems that all suspensions, tyres and general distribution of the weight has been kept identical to the other less-powerful models, while this &quot;pumped up&quot; engine provides a thrust that surprises even its own wheels. One unexperienced driver might lose control of the vehicle if not aware of the need to accelerate when drifting to the exterior of a curve in order to stabilise the car. This is known to Volkswagen and it shows that this model was proposed to the public only as a &quot;sporty&quot; alternative to the other TDI engines, without really being adapted to a sport driving style (with a diesel? pshaw!). There's a clear advantage in the quality of VW's TDI engines, but really, this one needs to be reviewed. I'm now driving a gentler Golf 2000 TDI 110hp and the difference is considerable. Stability is better, and the power available uphill, on accelerations and overtaking is more than enough. Max speed is nearly identical and the gearbox more adapted to the engine.  I'd still recommend this car for urban use (size) and for an excellent price/quality rate. It provides all necessary comfort within a reasonable space. <br><br>
