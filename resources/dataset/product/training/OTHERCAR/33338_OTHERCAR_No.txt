            My husband and I purchased the 1992 Plymouth Voyager a month before the birth of my twins.  We needed lots of room to travel.  We did purchase the warranty and boy am I glad.  The van broke down on me and the twins on my way to visit my parents in 1993.  The dealer checked it out and said it was minor and thought had it fixed.  On my way to my parents again it did the same thing of idling but not going past 30 m.p.h. on a highway of minimum speed of 45 m.p.h.  So I had to pull over and wait for a tow.  This time it was the malfunction of a gas chamber that they repaired but it took them about 2 weeks.  They did fix it for free but did not pay for a rental car.  
Then in 1994 to 1995 the paint began to bubble up.  The more it bubbled the more it began to peel.  My husband found out later that it was due to a primer and the paint had a chemical reaction and didn't mix.  We tried to see if the Plymouth people would help--not pay for entirely--on the cost of the repaint job.  They only came up with $150-200 on the hood and the entire van was chipping.  So we had it repainted at M.A.A.C.O. for approximately $900 for the entire van stripped, repainted and re-stripped.  
I am a loyal customer for something I believe supports their product.  I will never buy another Plymouth product.  Maybe that is why Plymouth isn't going to be in business of vans any longer!!<br><br>
