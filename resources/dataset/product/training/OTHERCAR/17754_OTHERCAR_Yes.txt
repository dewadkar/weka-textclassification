            In late 1993, my boyfriend rolled his car three times at 70 miles per hour ... with four adults in the car.  One person broke a nail.  The car was totaled, and yet it still drove (even with the alarm going off the whole way, but you can't have everything).  I was sold.

My boyfriend was driving a 1992 Saturn SL2.  Of course he bought another Saturn, and I have driven nothing but the Saturn S-series ever since, and 18 of my friends have bought them as well after test-driving mine.  I am happy to say that we are all very impressed.  It's true what they say in the commercials about this car being fantastic and the salespeople being wonderful too.  You can tell they're not working on commission and that they thoroughly endorse what they are selling.

And what's not to endorse?  The car is a twenty-something dream.  Not quite a luxury car, this is the best car that you're going to get in this price range, in my opinion.

A couple of years ago, I was involved in an accident of my own ... my first.  A truck smashed into us on a rainy day at about 40 miles per hour.  He just couldn't stop.  My precious little SL1, named Haze--she was smoky grey--was totaled!  I was very distraught, but my boyfriend and I both walked away from the accident.

Everyone--the police, the insurance company, our parents, us--was thoroughly amazed at this car and how it absorbed the impact of the collision.  Still driveable, I hung onto the car for another two weeks until my new Saturn came in and I was able to switch to the new one, this time a soft gold SL2.  This new car still never ceases to amaze me.  Her name is Wednesday.

Wednesday has been in the shop only once in the two years I've owned her, and that was my fault.  It is extremely reliable and wonderful to drive.  It handles like a sports car on the curves and there are a plethora of options to choose from when you order.  There is something for everyone.

People think I'm crazy when they hear how much I support this car ... until they drive mine.  Now, as I said, 18 of my friends liked it enough to buy it.  We take our Saturns on road-trips, camp in them (the seats fold down and you can carry anything in there!), proudly line them up all the way down the street and take pictures of them.  We have at least one representative of every color available.  What do you suppose the neighbors think?  We also happily rely on them every day.  I am a Saturn customer for life, so stay tuned for a review of the L-series ... I can't be a 20-something forever!<br><br>
