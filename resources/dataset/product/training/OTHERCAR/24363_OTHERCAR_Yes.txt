            I work in a virtual reality lab at the university I attend, so I get to be around tons of really cool equipment and toys all the time.  I must admit though, when our lab bought this digital camera, it became the most popular toy we had!  The F55 truly is an asset to our lab, and I only wish I had one of my own to take home with me!

What's so great about this camera?  First, the body of the camera is quite compact, so it is not a hassle to carry around.  It has a rechargeable battery which is neatly tucked in the side, and the battery can be replaced by a wire so that it can be plugged in.  The pictures are stored in a tiny disk called a &quot;memory stick,&quot; which then can be transferred to your computer.

The viewscreen on the camera is wonderful, with a high-resolution, full color version of each picture you take.  You can scroll through the pictures you have already taken and add or erase more at any time.  It is also possible to record movies, so that you have a camcorder and still-camera all in one.

There is no color distortion in the recorded images (as far as I've noticed) and the printouts I have made of various photos have turned out nicely.  Yet another nice feature is the consumer's ability to purchase memory sticks with more memory availabe, tailoring the camera's storage capacity to anyone's needs.  We've found in the lab that even with the smallest increment of memory we have more than enough.

The only downside of this camera is the price.  I actually do believe the camera is worth the money, but not that many people have a lot of extra cash to shell out for such things.  I have confidence, however, that the camera (like computers) will become cheaper as it gets better.<br><br>
