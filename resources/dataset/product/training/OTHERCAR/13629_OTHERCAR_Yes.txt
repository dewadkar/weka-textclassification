            My 325i now has 129,000 miles on it and it still runs like a champ.  I bought the car about three and a half years ago, and at the time it had about 55,000 miles on it.  It has been a great car, and I have no plans to let it go.

1992 was the first year of this body style and it continued until 1998 with the four door sedan.  The coupe and convertible versions continued until 1999.  The convertible starting in 1994.  E36 is the way that BMW designates this chassis and body style.

In 1992 there were two engines to choose from.  The 325i came with a 2.5 liter in-line 6 cylinder.  It produces 189 hp from the factory.  The 318i came with a 1.8 liter 4 cylinder that produces about 138 hp.  Putting an s on the end (i.e., 325is) was the designation for a two door coupe.

Driving the car is what it is all about!  With near perfect weight distribution and rear wheel drive, the car handles like a true sport sedan.  It takes corners as well, if not better, than most smaller sports car.  And it has the practicality of a 4 passenger car as well.  What else could you ask for?

For 1993 some changes were made.  Power seats became available on the 325i.  And the 6 cylinder got VANOS.  VANOS is variable valve timing for BMWs.  It doesn't really affect the peak hp, but it greatly improves the low rpm torque, making the car quicker off of the line.  It is a noticeable improvement especially with the automatic transmission.

In 1996 the 325 became the 328.  The 2.5 liter 6 was enlarged to 2.8 liter.  This change caused only a 1 hp improvement (peak horsepower went from 189 to 190) but torque was again improved.  And the 3 series got even quicker.

I have loved my E36 and would definitely recommend it to anyone!  For a car that is fun to drive, has a solid feel, has proven safety, and high build quality, you can't beat it!
