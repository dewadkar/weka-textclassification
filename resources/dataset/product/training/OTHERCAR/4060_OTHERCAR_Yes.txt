                 This mini-van has helped me live through college life!  My family purchased this vehicle new mid-year of 1998. We purchased it thinking we needed a &quot;family&quot; car to help us haul things. As it turned out I have been happily driving it for about 2 years now. 

      My verdict? I LOVE IT! I am 21 and a senior in college. Freshman year move in was a pain with renting trucks and vans to move me in and out. But by sophomore year our worries were virtually over. This mini-van had seats that came out. Mom and I drove me down to school and didn't have to worry about returning the rental or even paying for it. The seats simply stayed in the garage and we had a few days to move me in. 

      Shopping for groceries became such a breeze. No more cramming 50 pounds of food into a tiny truck. No more listening to it and not seeing it move around. In the Venture we simply put it in the back where the seats once were and we could pick up spilled things like a cinch. 

      That year I got to keep the car until they needed it, so for move out I didn't need mom.  I just piled everything into the Venture myself and off I went. When mom needed it to move her new furniture all I did was drive home and we were set. No more paying for moving fees!

      Friends? Yes they fit too. Just put the seats back in and myself and 6 friends can, and at times have comfortably driven to movies, dinners, baseball games, shows, Florida, Theme parks, and even to Ultimate Frisbee tournaments. No hassle. The gas mileage for long trips has been about 400 miles to the tank, giving me less frequent fill-ups and fewer hassles. Great stereo for tunes too! 

      As a Resident Advisor in the dorms my senior year I have driven with residents to campus functions and malls and retreats. No more hassle of renting vans. Just pile into mine! And for long trips for two just take out the seats and put down a blanket and some pillows. One person drives while the other sleeps. Or keep the seats in and sleep; there's enough room. 

      But how do I &quot;feel&quot; driving it? I feel good. It's a 6 cylinder so it's got kick. I've blown away a few sports cars in my time too so it's not just a family mobile. It's got a sleek exterior and is anything but boxy. People seem surprised when they see that's my car, maybe they expect a roadster, but I've never had anyone complain about it being too small or feeling enclosed. Now whenever I get into a regular car I feel enclosed.
 
     The Venture has made my life simpler and happier. Overall I'd recommend this car to anyone. In fact we liked it so much my uncle just bought one last month. Now we have two in our family. I've never had a problem with it. Just oil changes and gas tank ups.
