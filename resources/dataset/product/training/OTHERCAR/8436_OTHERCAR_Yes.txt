            I've owned the GS300 for since July 1999.  It's my first luxury car - graduating from a 1997 Pontiac Grand Prix.  I shopped around and compared it to the BMW 528i, Audi A6, Acura RL and Volvo S80.  The road handling of the 528i was great, but overall the BMW offered much less features - no CD player, poor cup holder placement and a very cramped back seat.  It was a great driving car though.  The A6 was clearly underpowered.  If it weren't for the crappy engine, I might be driving it.  It had the most features out of all the cars.  The RL was nice and probably the best value.  It had a great ride - it's just that it was so damn uninspiring - the design was &quot;old&quot;.  The Volvo was a rocket and packed some great features.  Unfortuntely, the car was very noisy and I couldn't get over the tailight design.

The Lexus won me over because of the sheer elegance of the car.  It was dead quiet, drove like a dream and had a great reputation for quality.  It's handling was most adequate and so is the power.

I've been back to the dealer many times, however, for nuisance things.  I'm very anal about rattles in the car and I've had several that had to be corrected:  Glovebox rattle, dashboard rattle, center console rattle and driver door rattle.  Most of these were fixed but some are still not.  Going to a Lexus dealer for service has been a great experience - so much different than the GM's.  They actually seem to care about your issues.  This is one reason these cars cost so much - but it is worth it.

The car only has 8K miles and it has a few chips on the drivers dash which I've complained about but they told me it was road debris.  I'm taking it to the dealer next week to refix the glovebox rattle and to reseal some insulation that came loose from the passenger door.

The best feature of this car is the ride.  It simply can't be beat - it's that smooth.  The indash CD player is great too - holding 5 CD's.  I've bought 5 extra CD holders, so my car has 25 CD's in it and can be changed very easily.  Seats are great - roadtripped from NJ to SC in one shot and the car was great - 14 hours.

Worst feature: expected less rattles than other cars and have been disappointed here.  Gas mileage is only about 20MPG.  <br><br>
