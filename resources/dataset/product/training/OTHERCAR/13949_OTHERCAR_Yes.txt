            I bought this car because I was tired of being passed by Saturns in my Honda Civic.
I loved the speed of this car, I love how easy it is to make this car even faster, a boost controller here, some exhaust there a k&amp;n here and WOW!
this was definitely the fastest thing I have ever driven. Top speed with modifications is limited to 157 Mph by the redline. I only took mine to 130 but that was too fast for me!
The Toyota Electronically modulated suspension was a real plus too, 3 settings and the computer did all the work, WOW.
What I didn't like about this car is that my head gasket and 5 of the 6 cyls. went out on me at 76k miles (before any modifications)
the new motor was quite expensive, so was the clutch and everything else.
This car is perfect for mechanics, speed freaks, and people that have too much money to burn on repairs.
