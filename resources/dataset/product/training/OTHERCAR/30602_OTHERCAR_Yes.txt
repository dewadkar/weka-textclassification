            I purchased a 1995 kia sportage ex from a dealership with an extended warranty. the warranty was money spent for no reason, although this was a used car, I've had it for 1.5 yrs. with no trouble. Performance is great, i have a 5 speed standard shift 4wd. The vehicle is comfortable has good pick-up on the highway and with only a 4 cylinder engine, there is good gas mileage. While vehicles tend to varrie from owner to owner, every one drives differently, i have no complaints and have had a few offers to buy the car from me but at this point i'm keeping my car. If you're in the market for a small suv, take another look at this one. Take a kia sportage out for a ride. I'm happy maybe you will be too!<br><br>
