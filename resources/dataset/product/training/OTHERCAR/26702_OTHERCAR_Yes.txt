            Since you've probably got other reviews available telling you about the camera, I'm instead going to tell you some pointers that you might not find elsewhere.

I just bought my first digital camera from Wal-Mart a month ago.  I thought $100 was a bargain price.  Boy, that's for sure.  Among the many faults, the worst was that the pictures (even when set to high resolution) were smaller than I wanted and incredibly blurry.  I returned the camera and was very disappointed.  My friend recommended this camera, so I jumped on CNET.COM and read the reviews (I recommend you do the same--CNET is a great resource for finding excellent PC hardware).  They were all sparkling.  This camera is CNET's pick for First Place Bargain Camera.  Here's the link:

I checked prices and found that although epinions says street price is $300, you can find it as low as about $234 (list price is $399).

I ordered this camera from an online seller called Digital Dog.  That was a very bad experience and I urge you to avoid them.  The digital camera newsgroups confirm my bad experience with those of other people.  They are very cheap, so you may be enticed into ordering.  Good luck if you do.  If you order from one of the retailers listed on CNET, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you order through a retailer that is a CNET Certified Merchant (it's marked on the retailer list page).  I had a very good experience with MPSuperStore.com.

Finally, some opinions about the camera itself:  The positives outweigh the negatives, but you should still be aware of the bad:

It's a tad heavy and really weigh's your pocket down if you put it there.  Accessories are fairly expensive.  The AC Adapter goes for $60 list price, and the memory upgrades can be expensive, but if you stick to the lowest memory upgrade of 16 MB, you can find it for about $20.  The worst thing about this camera is that it positively EATS batteries.  My friend says he gets about 20 shots before his batteries die.  He uses the viewscreen.  I don't, and I get somewhere around 40-50 shots before it dies.  I'm okay with that since I don't use it every single day.

The best feature of this camera is that it simply takes very, very sharp pictures.  That's what is most important to me, and probably you as well.  The pictures are just incredible, excellent quality.  I can't imagine ever wanting another digital camera after this one, and I am very picky.  If you get this one, you won't regret it.

** 12/2003 **
This camera died on me early this year!  It only lasted about 3 years, which was very disappointing.  It was becoming pretty dated, though, compared to the new, fancy compact cameras.  I bought the Canon PowerShot SD10 about a month ago as a replacement.
