            Earlier this year I came very close to purchasing a 1999 Mazda Millenia.  At the last minute I decided to go with the 1999 Honda Accord EX Sport Coupe.  The Honda was about $4,000 less, but the price really had nothing to do with my choice.

The Mazda Millenia is without a doubt, a very nice looking car.  When you get inside and close the door, you will know that you are sitting in a very solid car.  The seats are comfortable and the inside is laid out very well.  Personally, I liked the older model Millenia's were better because they seemed a bit bigger, and it definitely felt like there was more room in the back.

When shopping for a car, I had a small list of things that simply had to be on the vehicle in order for me to buy it.  It was my first new car purchase and I decided to go all out.  I wanted a V6, all leather interior, CD player, and a Sunroof.  No exceptions!  The Millenia offered all of these options in their S model, but carried a sticker price of just over $30,000 and the engine required premium gas.  The Honda that I ended up buying cost $26,000, has all the same features, and handles a lot better as well as gets about 5 miles per gallon more than what the Millenia gets.  My Accord does not require premium either.

I looked up some information on the internet about both the Accord and the Millenia.  The Millenia was always rated as looking well and being comfortable, but it was given C's for reliability and warned about it's very high depreciation.  The Accord is rated as having a very high resale value (perhaps the highest) of any car in it's class.

Ultimately, what was it that made me not go with the Mazda?  It was the salesman!  I'm sure he did not mean to turn me off the way he did, but he pointed out how Mazda has dropped several cars from their line, such as the 929 (which I loved) and the RX-7.  With this in mind I began to wonder how long it would be until they dropped the Millenia, because you don't see too many of them on the road.  If Mazda was to drop the Millenia from their line, I could only imagine how much replacement parts would cost.  Honda has been making Accords for over 15 years now and I have no doubt that they will continue to make them for years to come.<br><br>
