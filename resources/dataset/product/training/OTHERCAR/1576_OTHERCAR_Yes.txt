            <b><i>I have been a State of Michigan certified steering and suspension technician for almost 15 years, and certified in other areas for over 22 years.</b></i>  I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, engine, warranty, options, etc. points of view.  I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from a steering and suspension system point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed in this area. You can find some very well engineered and built suspensions, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed automobile purchasing decision. After reading my reviews, read some on other aspects of the car you're looking for from the advisors here at epinions, and make your choice.

<b>THE DODGE AVENGER:</b>

Whomever it was  that said something like &quot;imitation is the sincerest form of flattery&quot; was probably not thinking of the Dodge Avenger when they said it, but it fits like a fine driving glove. So then what or whom did the Avenger intend to flatter ? Probably no one, but flattery has a way of just occurring, and Dodge has imitated Honda, to the credit of the Honda engineers and the benefit of all Avenger owners past, present, <b>and</b> future.

Here's where the flattery begins. If you have read my reviews on any of the automobiles with the &quot;double wishbone&quot; front suspension, you already know it is one of the best suspensions in design, theory, and execution in the industry. When it debuted on the Honda Accord, it revolutionized  front suspensions forever.

The Dodge Avenger has stepped right into the flattery line and has created an automobile for the ages. The front suspension is of course of the &quot;double wishbone&quot; configuration. It is still one of the most reliable and technically advanced on the road. Instantaneous steering response and very predictable cornering is the result of another fine copy of what Honda already perfected. A four wheel independant suspension of incredible quality.

As with almost every other car sold today, not much of the steering and suspension system is greasable, so preventive maintenance is very limited, but with some rather medium high mileage Avengers already run through my shop, I haven't found many serious problems that would warrant a thumbs down.

 The tie rods, both inner and outer hold up very well, with the outers being the only bone of contention on the system. You will need to replace the outer tie rods, but not at any alarmingly low mileage point, and the repair is not too expensive. The steering rack is oriented to operate near horizontal on the inner tie rods, which aids in low wear on them. The ball joints hold up well, just like every other vehicle sporting this suspension type. It is a <i>very easy on the parts</i> kind of suspension. Well designed, and built with some quality components, a rarity these days coming from the &quot;Big Three&quot; auto makers.

With the &quot;double wishbone&quot; you don't have a conventional strut type suspension, but more like coil over shocks on the front damping things for the rest of the set-up. The ride is somewhat stiff, rather on the sporty side, but this was never intended to be sold as, nor purchased as a luxury car. When <i>Mr. Right</i> foot gets a little heavy, and the road turn a little serpentine, this is where the Avenger shines.

It has a medium effort steering, not as easy as the Honda which it copied, but no Mack truck either mind you. You get excellent feedback from the road, so you will be able to tell when traction may be starting to diminish, and decelerate accordingly.

You have a better than average anti-roll bar package, with the front much better than the rear, which also aids in the excellent feedback from the road you're traveling. It keeps things impressively level, until you get to the point where the speed is beyond the design of the car then you know that you've pushed things too far as traction goes south.

<b>ALIGNMENT ADJUSTABILITY:</b>

The front end is alignable for toe in/out only. This means be careful along curbs and around potholes. If it does get knocked out of alignment, there is no capacity to re-align camber, but with the other wishbone and wishbone copies, it wears the tires very well, even when the camber is very low. Kits may be available soon if it is discovered that there is a market for this, but so far the coil springs have done a super job, and don't seem to be of the type that weaken appreciably.


The rear is also toe adjustable only, but already kits are available to correct rear camber, but I have not had opportunity to install any of these yet, for lack of need. The rear springs mimic the front in quality and longevity.
