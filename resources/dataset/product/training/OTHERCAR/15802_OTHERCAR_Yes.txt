            We purchased a 2000 Chrysler Town &amp; Country Limited because of all of the features.  It has standard equipment options such as heated front driver and passenger seats.  Leather interior is standard.  Previously, we leased a 1997 Town &amp; Country LXi.  This 2000 model far exceeds the benefits that we were pleased with on our 1997 model.
The 2000 Limited drives like a luxury motor vehicle.  I love the way it handles and operates on the road.   Since it is a Chrysler product I know my family is safe in it.  The one part I dislike with the Chrysler is that the vehicle &quot;cigarette lighter&quot; sockets (there are two-one in front and one in back) lose power when the vehicle is off.  this is a problem for battery powered cell phones that are left on after the vehicle is turned off.  To correct this problem, you must ask the dealer for an override condenser.  On our 1997 LXi, I was not aware of this problem and my wife never seemed to have a cell phone battery that was fully charged.  This problem has been eliminated.
As far as storage goes, this minivan is fantastic.  That is the primary reason we leased a second one.  My wife never dreamed of being a minivan owner until our 1997.  Previously, she only would drive a SUV - which had to be a Ford product.  Now she will not consider anything other than this Chrysler product.
As far as the pricing goes, the 1997 lease cost more per month than our 2000 lease.  We received more of a vehicle for a better price.  I know it is not related to negotiation skills, but Chrysler was able to add more to its 2000 Limited yet keep the vehicle cost similar to its 1997 LXi cost.
By purchasing or leasing this vehicle you will not make a mistake.<br><br>
