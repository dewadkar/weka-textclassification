            I purchased the Canon PowerShot S330 from J and R Music World via mail order in May 2002.  I also purchased a spare battery, the battery charger, and a 128 MB flash memory card (which got lost or stolen, so I just purchased a 256 MB card).

Overall, I really like this camera.  It's easy to use.  I consistently get great photos - sharp, nice colors, accurate (what I was intending to photograph).  I use SnapFish to order prints, and I have been very pleased with the quality of the prints.  The prints from this camera are equally good, and often better, than those from my 35mm point & shoot (old Olympus Infiniti Twin).

The movie mode is fun to play with, but not much more.

I rarely use the manual mode - usually just if I want to have a little fun using the sepia tone, black and white, or other special modes.  When I'm out taking photos on vacation, on a hike, or at an event, I stick to auto mode.  Given that, I do use the various flash modes.  I also use the self-timer and the rapid-fire mode fairly regularly (rapid fire mostly for fun).

On the down side, this camera is not good for action photographs: the shutter response is just too long.  There are even times when I have trouble getting it to fire for a posed shot or a landscape.  Sometimes I just have to let up on the button and try again.  Repeated use has helped: I'm getting better at the art of pushing part-way, letting it focus, then pushing all the way for the shot -- if you do that right, it seems to shoot faster overall.  On the other hand, I did manage to get a great shot of dolphins jumping on a recent whale watching trip.

Another minor problem is the perceived weight.  For a camera that's so compact, it's pretty solid.  I love the durable body, but don't try putting it in your shirt pocket unless you're wearing a very heavy, stiff shirt.  Front pockets of shorts/pants are also problematic - it's heavy and bulky enough to look weird and cause excess "swinging" of the pocket.  I do best when I put it in the side cargo pocket of my hiking shorts or maybe in the interior pocket of a coat.  Otherwise, it goes in the bag (purse, backpack, whatever).

I've had excellent battery life, even with the LCD on - and I ALWAYS leave the LCD on.  The only problem there is that there's really no warning if the battery is getting low.  It just goes out (you get about 1 second warning).

The body is quite solid and seems very durable.  I have never worried about it - except for the LCD - and even the LCD has shown no signs of wear (just finger prints).  It came out fine after being dropped in guacamole once.  The only thing I question is the rubber flap over the line out jack, but it's been fine so far.

All in all, I have really enjoyed this camera.  It takes quality photographs that go right into my album alongside those from the 35mm ... and they have also gone onto my employer's web site from time to time.  It's also fun as a toy - taking photos in sepia on rapid fire, then watching them back with friends during a long plane ride or something.
