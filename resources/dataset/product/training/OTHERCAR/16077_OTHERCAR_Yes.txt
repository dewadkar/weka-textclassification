            I recently leased a year 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I immediately took to this vehicle the minute I laid eyes on it. Then when I test drove it, I knew it was &quot;the one&quot;. The Grand Cherokee has a very smooth ride with excellent handle.  In addition, the new design that has been created for this year's model, makes for a very attractive, less boxy, more aesthetically pleasing car. It has the feel and look of a luxury car with the sturdiness of a utility vehicle.

It also has great amenities like keyless entry, a console that lets you know when it's time for servicing, when you've left your car doors open, and even a compass and a thermometer. These aren't the add-ons, just the basics. It's also a family car. It's also great for transporting large items and the back seats convert easily for maximum space.

As with any of these sports utility vehicles, gas mileage -- huge problem! I have spent in excess of 25 dollars every week, just to run errands and pick my daughter up from school - all within a 20 mile radius from my home. I hate the gas mileage on this car. It's robbery. With fuel prices going up, I look to be spending 150 bucks a month in gas alone.

If you do not mind filling your tank twice every ten days, this may be the car for you. If you are a stickler about gas mileage, you'd probably be better off in a smaller more gas efficient vehicle. Probably not an SUV at all. But if you enjoy riding in comfort and would like to have the versatility of a vehicle that can go camping or to the opera, the Jeep Grand Cherokee is the best bet.<br><br>
