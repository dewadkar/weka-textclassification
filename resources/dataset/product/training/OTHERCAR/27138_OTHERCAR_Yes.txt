            Looking sharp on the showroom floor, this sporty model caught my eye as soon as I walked in the door. At a very affordable price, it was a satisfying purchase. I love the looks, the speed, and the reliability of the Dodge Avenger. It is comfortable and unique. It does have a couple of downsides, but they are not major. You can't hook a u-turn unless you are one a 4 lane highway, and it gets very bad gas mileage in cold weather. If you like speed and sporty looks, you will love this car. There is not much leg room in the back seat, so if you have teenagers or other adults that would have to regularly ride in the back seat, think again.. it gets a little cramped back there. Overall I am very satisfied with mine. <br><br>
