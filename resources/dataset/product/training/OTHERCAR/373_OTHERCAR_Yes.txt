            My husband and I looked and looked at all types of SUV's before deciding on the X-terra. We had the test drive down to a science.  My husband would have drive first and then when I drove, he would get in the back seat to see how a particular vehicle rode. We hit pay dirt with the X-terra, it has sooo much leg room, and a neat feature in the &quot;stadium seating&quot; in the back seat.  This enables the people riding in the back to see over the heads of the people up front. The X-terra has a very smooth ride for an SUV, along with lots of legroom and storage room, with the titanium racks and basket on top. It comes with a stocked first aid kit, as well as hooks for bicycles.  I love driving the X-terra. It is the type of vehicle other people notice. I catch people staring all the time. Another neat thing I have noticed, is that since it is relatively new, the other X-terra owners seem to notice you as well and always speak when they pass you on the road.  This is not a vehicle for someone looking for alot of &quot;bells and whistles&quot;, as it is relatively a &quot;no frills&quot; type vehicle. For instance, it does not come with leather seats, and is marketed more towards people who actually use an SUV for camping and 4-wheeling. It is a great vehicle for the price, and I honestly don't dislike anything about it. I think everyone condsidering an SUV should test drive the X-terra. You won't want anything else!<br><br>
