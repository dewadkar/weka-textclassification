            I recently purchased the Polaroid 640 over the weekend, and omigosh I love this thing! My brother joking around, took a photo of the TV while friends was on, and it took the best photo I've ever seen. I bought a second one for my parents because it was so easy for them to use. My mom was thrilled because she could now take pictures of whatever she wanted to, AND get them from the camera. This camera is good for any beginning photographer, and very easy to use. I can't find anything I dislike about this product, I've used many digital cameras from many diffrent price ranges, and this is the only one that I've found that has this good of a quality for the price. The photo's look good with 32bit color as well as 256 colors.  Even my mom can use this thing, and she *still* can't figure out the scanner.
The preview mode is the best I've seen across all camera's. Even the Sony can't top this one in my book, and I used the mavica for about a good year and a half, the accessories were hard to replace.. the polaroid 640 has easy to get ahold of accessories, and they arent in Bill Gate's price range, they are actually affordable... It does go through the AA batteries quickly, hence why the power supply is included and suggested to be used when downloading photo's from the camera.

I had to call polaroid support about two weeks ago, because the LCD display had gone kapootz.. I was on hold for about 3 minutes (during the busy part of the day) A very very very nice support person helped me try to reset the camera, the attempt was unsucessful, but the support person quickly said &quot;write down this number&quot; and I got all the information I needed to send my camera in to be fixed. So, I sent it in that day, and it was like a Wednesday, they got it by friday (go USPS) and by wednesday of the following week, UPS brought me a box containing my new camera, and a packing slip explaining the replacement.
Ive never had such speedy service, ever. Polaroid definately goes above and beyond, and I really apreciated it, because I needed my camera for work, and couldn't be without it for weeks. The best part was, the support agent didnt tell me how long it would be at their service center, just a rough guestimate that was 2-3 weeks, so I was a little sad to see my camera go, but when I got it back within days, I was thrilled.

Kudos to Polaroid. :)<br><br>
