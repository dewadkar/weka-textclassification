            i love this car!! it has great steering and good seat compacity for a small car. I got the model that was a darkish green green color and looks very nice when washed or polished. It goes fast when you punch it for all of the people who live in the fast lane. I have it on a lease and am definately considering buying it!! I recommened this car for anyone who likes a car that holds up in almost any condition! It is also a good price and i recommened it for all!! It has a manual shift and is a great overall car for car lovers everywhere <br><br>
