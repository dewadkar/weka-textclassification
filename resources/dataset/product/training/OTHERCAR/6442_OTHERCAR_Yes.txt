            We purchased this car in February 1995 from a Toyota Dealer in Maryland. We bought the LE 4 cyl. with no additional packages. It came with power windows/ power locks/ motorized radio antenna, AM/FM/Tape, dual fold-down rear seat-backs. At the time it was purchased it was a roomier car than the competition, but the standards of roominess in the mid-size sedan category have gone up considerably since 1995. This car currently has 120,000+ miles on it. And it still runs well.

You are probably reading this review because you are thinking of buying this car as a used model. Let me try and give you some insight on what to look for. I for one, did very regular oil changes and tune ups on this car. Every car needs this, but Toyota's, especially when one expects them to live upto their reputation of reliability need these routine upkeep to keep them running well. Aside from routine work, this car really has had no problems. The engine is still good, the timing belt was recently replaced, and the transmission is healthy. So, that is one thing to look for, the upkeep records.

Now, here are some other things I can think of. The exhaust pipe, if you look at it, runs low to the ground. This is a toyota trademark, but from what I have heard this sometimes (and this is rare) proves to be a liability. Check for exhaust noise and rattle. I know for a fact that my muffler is starting to go, and makes this awful groaning noise at low RPM. Take the car on the highway and listen to the gears shift. Toyota transmissions are very well made, so I'd be surprised to find a flaw here. Check for engine noise and open the hood to check the general health of the internals. 

Now, lets go to the interior. This car is very functional. Compared to the Nissan Maxima from the same generation, you will notice that the seats are narrower, the foam is plush and the gears levers and knobs are low-frill/no-frill. But for the most part they do their job, nearly ten years later. Check the power locks, I had the rear right door lock stop working in 1998 and it wasn't cheap to fix it. The power window motors on these cars are strong and should work well. Another problem for me has been the LED on the stereo - mine has lost a couple of segments, making it hard to figure out what station I am tuned to. Also, one of the backlights on the instrument cluster has recently died. I anticipate that this too will not be cheap to get fixed. Otherwise the seats and driving positions are excellent and suffice. A plus is that this car has dual airbags. 

The fuel economy on this car is good. It gives me 350 miles on a full tank, which is about 13-14 gallons. The acceleration, even now is excellent, gears shift well and it handles and turns nicely. Only complaint - and this was from day one - the brakes on this car work well, but they don't give you a commanding confidence in your stopping ability. On rough dirt or slight ice, they skid more than on my other cars, and so I always keep that in the back of my mind when I drive it. 

This car has been on many road trips up and down the East Coast and into Canada. It has never and I repeat, never failed on us. Knock on wood ("knock, knock") but aside from a flat tire due to a nail on the NJ Turnpike, I have never had to call roadside assistance on this car. I trust it implicitly. Only thing - on long road trips the audio system comes short on power and deep bass response, and the rubber linings on the windows are not keeping noise out as well as they used to. But in the winter, this car heats up quickly and drives well.

I recommend this car. If you can find one with 80K miles, I would pay upto $8500 for it. I would pay over $7000 for a 100k+ model. When looking to buy a high mileage mid-size sedan, the camry is it. 

Take it to a expert, unless you yourself are one, and if it looks like the previous owner(s) nurtured this car well, chances are it will serve you well. It really is a good car!
