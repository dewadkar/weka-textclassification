            I bought a new Dodge Stratus in June of 1996. I was looking for a sporty mid-size car that had comparable quality of Japanese cars - similar in class but not at the higher price tag. The Stratus fit all of those needs and my wife and I were very happy with the car...until recently. As soon as the mileage hit 60,000 it seemed as though the car knew the warranty was running out and things started to go wrong.

A major oil leak developed and it was determined that the engine head gasket was bad and needed replacing..and as long as we were doing that we also had the timing belt replaced as well. This was not an inexpensive job very (labor intensive)to the tune of about $900.00. So, with that said I figured OK it could have happened to anyone with any car. I then started to see reports from the manufacturer that faulty head gaskets were vehicle re-calls for Dodge Neon models.. but not yet for the Stratus. You want to talk about RECALLS.. the Stratus had it's share - many of which were safety related and just general &quot;Re-design as we go&quot; for design flaws and general problems. Also the car does not ride as &quot;nice&quot; as it used to. I have had the struts replaced and the ball joints as well and it isn't the same. NO - the car was never in an accident or ever hit by anyone. 

Aside from this, the car really has been dependable - always starts and has never failed on the highway for any reason - requiring a tow. The exhaust system is lifetime warranty (ss steel) and has not needed any attention as of yet. The breaking system is OK, with the regular maintenance intervals for disc brake systems. The Dodge Stratus is fairly fun to drive - not as nice as a Honda Accord - but better than a Nissan Altima. Why do I say this - because my brother has both of these vehicles which I have driven on several occasions.

In closing, I have very mixed emotions about the Dodge Stratus. It still looks good, drives OK, average overall value but has had what I would consider some major problems - oil leak and I forgot to mention some weird sound coming from the transmission when the car decelerates. Maybe it will be another re-call - Should I wait and see or dump the car? What would you decide? <br><br>
