            I love  my new Santa Fe!
Mid-year Hyundai seemed to tackle one of the major complaints people have had with the Santa Fe- lack of power by releasing the GLS with a 3.5 liter engine. 
I purchased a GLS model with a 3.5 Liter, V6 engine. I have no complaints about its ability to accelerate and handle in traffic or in the mountains. It has the power it needs to allow you to look down and realize that you are going 85 on the highway without realizing it.  

The ride is smooth and I find the car very comfortable. My 6'2'' husband has plenty of room - even in the backseat. 

So far my complaints are only nit-picky - the door handles need backlights and there should be a button inside to open the back glass.  

You really get a lot for your money with a Santa Fe. I looked at every model of SUV in its class and it won hands down. Believe me- I was surprised as you are. I initially ruled it out and it kept coming up as recommended in my research (Consumer Reports, etc&#133) I decided to give it a try and was hooked.

The closest competitor was the Escape but the Hyundai warranty really soothes any workmanship issues you might encounter in a Ford or the Hyundai. Also, all the "extras" I got with the Santa Fe - sun roof, 6 CD player - would have cost A LOT more in the Escape. I also had a hard time finding Escapes at a comparable price with the safety features that are standard in the Santa Fe. In my opinion, the Rav-4 and CRV engines were just not what they should be for an SUV.  

We had several dealers appeal that the Santa Fe would not have the resell value of a Toyota or Honda. This was typically the only thing bad they could say about the car. 

I suggest you give the Hyundai a try. If you are looking for extra space, unique styling, and lots of extras without outrageous prices &#150 the Santa Fe is a good bet. 

I will update this if my opinion changes over the next year of ownership.
