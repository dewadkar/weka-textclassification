            I've only owned this truck for 2 days, so don't expect much of a review just yet.  I just wanted to write in agreement with a previous reviewer (leonardskinner), that this truck is so completely and utterly basic... what could go wrong?  No power steering or power brakes or electric windows or locks -&gt; low maintenance.  And for this little truck, lack of power steering and brakes isn't even noticed.

I *can* say, that it has held up well for the first 8 years of it's life, and can see no reason why it won't last another 8.  It is a lot peppier than I would have expected, in city traffic at least.  5-speed manual transmission is a plus at today's gasoline prices.<br><br>
