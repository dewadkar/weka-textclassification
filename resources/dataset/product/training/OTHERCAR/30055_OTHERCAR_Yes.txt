            My husband and I bought this camera in April 2000.  It is our first digital camera.  We did a lot of research before purchasing and we ended up being very happy with what we got.

The Kodak DC280 is very easy to use.  Point and shoot.  That is all there is to it.  I find that the marks in the view finder are off center and I sometimes need to retake a photo, but seeing as how it's digital and I'm not wasting film, it's not too big of a problem for me.

We like the size of this camera.  Some of the digital cameras out there are monsterous!  The Kodak DC280 is no bigger than your average 35mm point and shoot, which is nice.  No big square thing to lug around.  Fits in almost any type/size camera bag that you may already have.  It's a bit heavier than the standard 35mm camera, though.

The viewing screen is small and doesn't show any indication of how the quality of the photograph full size will be.  But it gets the job done.  I can make sure my photo is centered, etc.

The functions on the camera are plentiful and easy to use.  Tricks like close up, infinity focus, black and white and borders are a snap to figure out.  I was able to figure most of the functions out in the first day without consulting the manual.

We were mostly happy with the photo quality produced by the Kodak DC280.  Colors were bright, lighting was good (thanks to the auto flash)... we've had a few photos printed and are more than satisfied with the end result.  Even on "good" quality and standard resolution, the pictures are clearer than any I've ever been able to take with a consumer grade 35mm camera.

For us, the rechargeable battery life is average.  We don't use the viewing screen much... only to review what we've taken.  What seems to drain the batteries the most is transferring the photos from the camera to the computer.  Whether using USB or serial, it takes quite a bit of juice from the batteries.  I would highly suggest picking up an AC adapter to use when transferring your photos (it isn't typically included with the camera and must be purchased separately).

The software included with the camera is helpful, although with the exception of the camera/pc interface, we didn't find it impressive or necessary.

All in all, I love this camera.  I plan to continue using it for at least a couple more years.  It's easy to use interface and high quality end result makes for a really great hobby/family camera!
