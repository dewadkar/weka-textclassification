            As a middle aged woman, one of the things that I really like about my GMC Sierra is its sheer size. I like to be able to see over traffic, and the laws of physics being what they are, there is no question that this truck is just plain safer in a crash than a car. 

All that aside, this is one pretty truck. A nice curvy hood and fenders set off by muscular looking bumpers is the package for an attractive interior. And this truck has both a driver side and passenger side airbag as standard. I have the 5.3 liter V-8 engine, which is all the power you could ever ask for. I live in the snow belt, and have found my truck to handle in snow just fine. (I have 4 fifty-pound sand bags in the bed.)

Please, though, trucks aren't for people with little kids. Little kids belong in a car seat in the back seat of a car or an SUV.<br><br>
