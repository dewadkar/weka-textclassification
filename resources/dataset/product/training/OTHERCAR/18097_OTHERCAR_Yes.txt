            I recently bought a used 1996 Dodge Neon for 7,000$.  I was very impressed with the smooth ride and the good gas mileage.  I can get around 30 miles per gallon in the car.  Which was a good improvement from the Tahoo I used to drive.  But, lately I've been having some problems with the vehicle.  Mainly some small engine problems have been annoying me.  The sunlight has damaged and cracked the dashboard.  For the price though, I am very impressed with this car.  It gets relatively good pickup for the engine size.  I am very pleased the overall output of the Neon.  I have yet to encounter any serious problems, but I have the feeling that something may soon go wrong.<br><br>
