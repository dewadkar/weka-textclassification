            Having purchased a DSC-S70 I am really not pleased with their after market service. The Photo suite software is not working on my system and I have spent Hours on the phone to resolve my problem with no satisfaction. I have win ME on my system,300meg Ram,20gig HD, etc. The program locks up everything when using the Magnify Functions of Photo suite and the only remedy is a soft boot. Also does not find my USB port and down load the pictures as my trial version of Sierra Imaging Expert does. This program finds my Created drive of the Sony camera and views or down loads all the pictures as needed and deletes the pictures on the Stick and creates a file with the date as a file name (which can be renamed) and lets me fine tune and print my pictures. Now Sony has been no help, in fact they give me the signal to BUZZ off and not bother them anymore.All I asked for in the end was a new program "CD" but they figured that I am stuped I suppose and don't want to help me (the end of my relationship with Sony and I have lots of Sony Entertainment stuff,BUT NO MORE)I have 5 trial versions of Photo Enhancing programs on my Computer right now and all run as they should.I will get by without Sony, with my DSC-S70 camera, as their aftermarket service simply said,'STINKS'.  

When you point the S-70 (maybe the S50 and S30 too, I dunno) at a low light subject, you have to wait for it to come into focus while viewing the LCD (not the viewfinder!), a couple of seconds at most. When it focuses, then all shots after that will be sharp. I also have a Canon T-70 and a Pentax K-1000, and lemme tell you, it takes time to retrain an old brain with an impatient trigger finger!!! 

Not real happy but will do for now.
