            JVC-MODEL GC-QX3

When I first got my camera it was new on the market, and we paid $900.00 for it at a discount store, which carries electronics goods as well as other things like furniture, and appliances.  I thought as a travel agent, it might come in handy to be able to post images of places I�ve been to on the Web for my clients to look at.

I couldn�t believe how small the discs are which hold the images.  You can buy them in such a format that they can hold differing amounts of images, while the physical size of the disc stays the same.  It seems like a miracle. 

One thing I found out is that pictures of landscapes take up more space on the disc than a portrait, for example.  Before my last trip to Italy, I bought a 16MB disc to extend the quantity of pictures I could get, and to compliment the 16MB and 8MB discs I already had.  Well, I only used up the 8MB and part of one 16MB disc in two-week time period.  I had already taken 89 pictures on the 16MB disc and there was room for lots more.

You will get different numbers of pictures depending on the resolution you choose.  I used 640x480, and standard quality, and they came out just fine.  When viewed on the computer, they are beautiful, with clear, sharp distinction.  If you were planning to print them off onto photo paper, you might want to chose FINE for a better quality print, but you would not get as many photos from one disc.

The thing I like about my camera is that right after I take a picture, I can chose a setting which will let me look at what I just took.  If it is not centered properly, or if you want it to be a closer view, or someone�s expression isn�t the best, you can just delete it and re-take it.  We had a waiter take our photo at the table one night, and he was so intrigued that he just kept deleting and re-taking...not quite believing it was possible.

There is a 20 second moving-picture capability with the JVC GC-QX3 as well, but I have not used it yet, having a separate video camera for that function.

This camera is very small and not too heavy, and you can hook it up to a computer to transfer the images to the hard drive or to a computer disc.  You can also hook it up to a television set, or just look at the pictures in the digital display screen on the camera itself.  The latter is what I would do in my hotel room at night, using the supplied cords and recharging unit, to see how the pictures I had taken that day turned out.  Then I could save and protect (from accidentally deleting), or I could actually delete some, making room for more shots the next day.

The only disadvantage I have found is that sometimes you can�t see what�s on the camera screen in the sunlight, so you have to end up holding the viewfinder up to your eye to make sure what you want is in the frame.

There is also an option to let you get in the picture too, because there is a self-timer.  It�s best to have a tripod to keep it steady.  You have 8 seconds from the time you push the button until the flash goes off and takes the picture.  In most cases it is plenty of time for you to scoot around and get yourself in the picture, too.  With 3 seconds to go, the light starts flashing like crazy to let you know it will be snapping soon.

There are other things you can do too...such as a special effects mode, a collage mode, and imprinting the date and time.  This function has other options in that the date can be on the front of the picture, the back of the photo or on both sides, or not at all.

You can have the flash on automatically, or operate it manually, as well as have the red-eye reduction mode.  And finally, you can operate the whole thing manually, imputing and adjusting all the settings yourself for each photo.

The battery will not last as long if you keep checking the pictures to see if they are just what you want, or if you keep showing other people the images you just took. I always carry two batteries with me...one in the camera and an extra one...just in case it runs low. If you aren't going to snap any pictures for awhile, it can save on the battery to remove it from he camera.

I love my camera and take it with me on all my trips, and would recommend it to everyone!
