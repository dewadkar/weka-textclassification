            We all know how dreaded Monday's can be as you climb out of bed and just can't get that energy revving up so you rough ride the entire day just getting by doing the essentials and no more.  Well, that summarizes the daily performance of my 2000 Hyundai Accent.  

We purchased our Hyundai Accent 2000 in April of this year so I thought I would share all the things that I love and hate about it with the world.  Hopefully, our Epinion may alert some other unsuspecting buyer.  

We hadn't owned the car a month before we had to return it to the shop.  My husband was driving the car to work on a rainy day when the windshield wipers quit working.  There he sat for two hours in the breakdown lane waiting for the rain to stop.  Since that time, we received a &quot;Recall&quot; indicating that the Hyundai Accent 2000 had problems with some mechanism in the windshield wiper motor.  Sadly, the recall in this case was &quot;a day late and a dollar short.&quot;   However, other than routine maintenance, we haven't needed to make any other repairs... yet (knock on wood).   

<b> What I loved...</b>

           <i>The price.</i>

           <i>Great for city driving.</i>

           <i>Decent gas mileage</i>

<b>What I hate... </b>

<i>The LOCATION of the CUPHOLDERS!!  Obviously a non-smoker designed this car as the cupholders are located over the ashtray.  Thus, it is impossible to have a cup of coffee in the cupholder and flick ashes into the ashtray at the same time.</i>

<i>The seatbelt on the passenger side.  For some reason, it doesn't have any slack to it like the driver's side does.  Consequently, you can't lean forward to pull something out of the glove compartment without undoing the seatbelt.</i>

<b>What I despise the most...</b>

<i>The &quot;get up and go&quot; has got up and went.  Even though it has overdrive, the engine has no power.  Merging onto a freeway from the on-ramp can and often is a scary situation with this little car.</i>

<b>Conclusion...</b>

<i>Definitely not recommended for long distance highway driving.  However, would make a great little car for a non-smoker who is only going around the block a mile or two.</i>

We always welcome your comments and feedback.  Until next time...  <b>Have a Great Day!</b>
