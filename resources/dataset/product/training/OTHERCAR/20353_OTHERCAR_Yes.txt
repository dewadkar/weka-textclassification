              As soon as we got on the lot my father and I knew we were going to be driving this car home- the nice new crisp paint was the main seller for us, plus it was nice behind the wheel. I'm talking about my 1991 Pontiac Sunbird SE, 2-door, 2.0L engine , power windows/locks, tilt, cruise etc...

 I have been driving this car for the last 4 months and the only major thing I had to do is put gas in it :). It is quite easy on the pricy stuff too (just the other day I made a trip into the city and picked up a load of computers, the car was loaded completely and I couldn't even see out the back windshield, and I thought  had lost the rear tires up inside the wells :) I even had a moderatly heavy friend in the front and I still did ok on gas)  . Although my father being a mehanic did mention that it is quite hard on oil. The car is also very easy to find spare parts for since a lot of this type have long since rusted out if not taken care of properly. The car is pleasing on the eyes if, again, taken care of right. 

  I do take care of my car, but I am a fairly young so we have had some good times. Their was a period of a few months where I treated the car as if had been entered in a full time derby- this was quite brutal. I swear nothing broke or even rattled :)I was surrpised- and certainly will never treat my baby like that again.

  Overall the mechanical view of this car is crystal clear, nothing stands out as not working properly or even breaking. It is only the little problems that annoy me, like the mechanical headlights on the '91 seem to burn through the electric motors quickly, so therefore I am left with them having to be placed and tied up inside the hood, which leaves and 'in progress' look to the car from front on. Also minor other things that a car of this age would have. 

 The 2.0L engine is a nice ride but I plan to drop a 3.1 out of a  Cav. this summer in it- because I have had a few close passing calls and plus I want the fastest car in the school parking lot :) I am also going to repaint it from it's midnight blue to white with fire orange strips going up over the hood all the way to the rear bumper. It's going to look nice I believe. I will also have to replace the 3 speed auto trans. when I place the new engine in it. I do not like how the 3 speed drags out every bloody gear until it shifts over. Overall this is my first car and I want to keep it for sometime, after I modify it though it may be for sale a year later- who knows :) If anyone reading this review has any info on modifying this type of car please let my know via m.clattenburg@myexcel.ca or any other interesting info to do with the Sunbird.
