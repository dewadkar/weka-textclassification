            I bought my Sony Digital Mavica after a buddy I met online came over and showed me his-- I HAD to have one and bought it the next weekend. I love that I do not have to take film to get developed, which wastes time and privacy is lost. With digital cam, nobody but who you want sees your pics. I like that a floppy disc can hold so many pics (for me, it's about 40 per disc). I love that I can immediately see what the pic looks like, either on the camera itself or on my PC. That way, if I don't like the shot, I take another seconds later. It is nice to be able to immediately delete any pic I don't like for whatever reason.  It is great to be able to easily send pics to friends, relatives, new possible dates over the Internet --- no need to wait for development, mail, etc. I also like so if I want to be a good uncle, I take the camera and a handful of 50 cent floppy discs with me, take pics and I can just hand the disc with the pics of the kids right to them to take home (they can always easily E-mail me a copy, either individually or as a Zip file).  Though not the same as photos, I can print a pic to mail to someone and they usually like it better than a photo because it is bigger --- 8 x 10.

Be SURE to spend the extra $100-$200 and get a cam that lets you insert the floppies into it directly. My brother has the other one where the camera &quot;remembers&quot; the pic for his computer. It takes an extra attachment and extra step and seems like a real pain in the neck to me.

Mine is perfect for day time pics.  At night though, I have difficulty getting good pics. They are either too dark (without flash) or too bright (with flash). I wish the timer was longer than 10 seconds! 10 seconds is nowhere near enough time to set up a self pic or group pic and press the button, then run to the scene and come out looking not frazzled! The lens cap falls off too easily and there is no carrier---such an expensive item should have a carrying case. The printed directions are so, so difficult, not as bad as ones for a VCR but close and for no reason.<br><br>
