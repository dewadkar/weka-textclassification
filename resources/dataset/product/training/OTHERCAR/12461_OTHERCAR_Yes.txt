            Although my new S40 is only a week old, I�m already convinced that I bought the right car.  If you�re looking for a mid-priced sedan, I think the S40 is one of the best looking, best performing, safest cars out there.

After driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee for three years, it�s a bit of an adjustment going back to a &quot;car&quot;, but there�s a lot to like about the S40.  Mine has the Sunroof Package (which also includes leather seats) and the Sport Plus Package (which adds a rear spoiler, premium stereo, fog lights, trip computer, and power driver�s seat).  The rear spoiler really adds a lot to the &quot;look&quot; of the car.  Without it, it tends to look a lot like every other sedan out there.  With all those bells and whistles, tax, title, license, etc. the car runs right around $30,000.

The car is a great city car.  Living in San Francisco, that�s important.  It zips up the steepest hills, has a good tight turning radius, and good visibility for a chronic lane-changer like me.   The 160 hp engine has 170 ft-lbs. of torque available as low as 1,800 rpm�s.  That might sound like techno-babble, but it translates into a quick pick-up from a dead stop or a good burst of speed on the highway when you need it.

I�m 6 feet tall and the S40 is plenty roomy.  In fact, the driver�s seat slides back about three inches farther than I need it to.  But in order to fit an adult comfortably in the back seat, I�d need to pull my seat pretty far forward.  I rarely use the back seats, so I can definitely cope with pulling my seat forward on those few occasions.

The jury�s still out on the premium stereo.  I had expected it to sound a little cleaner than it does, but I still haven�t decided whether it�s worth swapping out for something better still.

Volvo didn�t skimp on any of their hallmark safety features either.  As the &quot;baby&quot; of the Volvo line this car has everything:  dual front airbags, side-impact airbags, and their new whiplash protection system.  The back seats are also baby seat ready.

Additional features that I like are the folding back seats that expose the interior of the trunk.  That�s great for large items that won�t quite fit in the trunk.  I also like all the interior storage areas, the alarm system, and sensibility of the interior styling.

Check out edmunds.com for all the specs, price it at carsdirect.com, and go test drive one at your local Volvo dealer.  You�ll have fun!
