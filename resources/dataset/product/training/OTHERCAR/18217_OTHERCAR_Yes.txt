            1998 Acura Integra GS-R purchased in March 2002 from a private party.

After three months:

Looking for a new or used car in the $12K to $15K range, it came down to this or a new 2002 Mazda Protege.  I saw a 2000 Integra LS at a dealership, and liked it a lot, but, after reading reviews, decided that I should test-drive the higher performing GS-R.  I tried 3 of them, and two of them had rattling noises that came out under high revs (in one case) or hard cornering (in the other).  The new Protege would have been a sensible choice, but I was hooked on the superior driver's feel of the Integra, so I bought the quiet one.

I hadn't gotten away from the noise: after a week I had some funny noises, half of which were fixed under warranty at the (friendly but perhaps a little expensive) Acura dealership.  The "cat shields" (in the exhaust system) were rattling, and one of the exhaust pipes was resonating.  Warranty covered this, and I was told it was a "known issue" with my model.  (Also, the underbody had suffered through four New England winters.)  The other noise, a squeak or whistle that occasionally occurs as the clutch is engaged in first gear or reverse, seems to have to do with a worn bearing, and appears to be primarily an aesthetic problem.

Despite these problems, the car seems mechanically sound.  And it is definitely fun to drive.  It accelerates quickly enough to give a good feeling of speed, though it's no muscle-car.  VTEC makes for an extended powerband, and you can go 85 in third gear: sprinting away from a toll booth or up an on-ramp ends with a shift from third (or even second!) straight to fifth.  The downside is that below 4000 rpm nothing exciting is going on.  (Unless fuel efficiency is exciting.) 

The car really rocks in the twisties.  And rolls a little; but the handling is tight enough to allow taking turns at pretty high speeds while remaining well within control.  

I bought the car with the original tires still on it at 45K miles.  I drove on them in the rain once and felt like I was back in my beater.  So I put on some Bridgestone Potenza Pole Position S-03's.  These are phenomenal tires.  The car can really exhilarate as the front wheels dig-in and pull on tight turns.   The tires are especially impressive in rain: now I can do things on the wet that I wouldn't do in other cars on the dry.

And the car is beautiful.  It turns heads, even with so many Integras on the road.  The overall styling is jaunty but not at all garish, and the stock alloys have a great design that fits in perfectly.  Car magazines complain that Acura barely modified the styling of the Integra in its last few years, but why fix what ain't broke?  

I find the human comforts to be reasonable, even for long trips, though it isn't a Lexus.  I find the seat comfortable now, but only after extensive tweaking of the adjustors.  The cloth seat-covers feel nice and seem to be of very high quality.  The AC is clearly not powerful enough for a summer in Phoenix, but it should be adequate for me.  Very tall people may not feel comfortable even in the front, and only small people can comfortably ride in the back.  The "cup holders" are fine for cans, but nothing bigger.  The stock stereo sounds good and has enough power for people who don't care to damage their ears or insure that everyone else on the block knows what they're listening to.  (It wouldn't make sense to put a very high-end stereo in anyway, as the engine is so loud.)

One thing to worry about is theft.  From CNN, May 15, 2002: "The Acura Integra tops a new study listing the most stolen passenger vehicles for the model years 1999-2001, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute."
