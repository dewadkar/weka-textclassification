                 I bought my Jeep Wrangler - red - to rebel against impending old age.  Well, there were other reasons, like the fact that I live in a very hilly, very snowy 16-lake community where it is impossible to get up my driveway in the winter; the four-wheel drive is WONDERFUL.  I love to kayak, so I can unzip the back window, push the front passenger seat forward, and shove my kayak right across the top of the back seat and bop on down to the lake.  The top - OO-h-h!  That wonderful convertible top -I can put it down (and up, too!)  by myself.  My husband's job keeps him away from home quite a bit, so that feature is really helpful.  The only thing I don't like is the road noise - that wonderful cloth top eliminates very little of it. I suppose I could get a hard top, but it might cramp my style.  I was told the cloth would be cold inthe winter and too hot in the summer, but my Jeep's AC and heater are quite sufficient! I purchased the 4 cylinder, but would recommend the six.
     If you are looking for something that makes you feel young again, want the adventure of a stick shift, and like all the other &quot;more mature&quot; Jeep Wrangler ownrers to smile and wave at you, go ahead and buy.  But you have to be the kind of person who likes to laugh - especially at yourself.<br><br>
