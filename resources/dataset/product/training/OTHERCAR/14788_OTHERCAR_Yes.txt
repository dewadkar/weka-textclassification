            My business is smocking dresses for flower girls, communion, and christenings. Many of the dresses are white embroidery on white fabric, so they do not show up well in regular pictures.
One day a website builder walked into my shop and showed me how he could take digital pictures for a website for me. Well, that was all the inspiration I needed. So, I went online and started gathering information about digital cameras.
For the price range I could afford, the Umax Astracam showed me the best features.  I ordered online and found that the shipping time was incredibly fast (2-3 days).  Setting up and learning to use the camera was easy and quick. The software program is extremely helpful, too.  It is possible to do so many things with the photos I take.
But the best part is the fact that my pictures of my dresses came out so beautifully and with such great detail. Wanna see? Go to www.smockingroom.com and click on &quot;Custom Sewing&quot;.<br><br>
