            Subaru used to be a rather funky nameplate that appealed largely to those who live in  the snow or �those weird neighbors from Oregon� we�ve all lived next to at one point or another (Saab and Volvo people seem to be cut from the same cloth as Subaru owners).  Of course this type of attitude is not very deeply rooted in the present, but rather a dim automotive past that in the harsh light of today�s new car market shows Subaru to be an innovator rather than a funky back marker in the race to sell quality cars. Plus, you�ve gotta love a car company that still makes boxer engines, has all-wheel drive on every model and gives the competition a sound beating in almost every rally racing venue.

Let�s face it, Subaru essentially invented the �crossover� vehicle  with the first Outback (technically the AMC Eagle was the first, but that was just slightly ahead of its time) � a small station wagon with raised suspension, all-wheel drive and rugged exterior panels sounds all too familiar now, but way back in 1995, it was the beginning of a current trend in new cars that is showing no sign of stopping. How many car-based SUVs are essentially copies of the Outback, and later Forester? We can count them � Audi All Road, Volvo CrossCountry, Pontiac Vibe and to a lesser extent the Pontiac Aztek all owe a debt of gratitude to the first Outback. But remember, the Outback concept is now 7 years old, the previously mentioned cars are virtually brand new.

First introduced in 1997, the Forester employs the same basic idea as the Outback  It�s really a simple formula, and yet Subaru thought of it first (AMC Eagle notwithstanding). The Forester is an SUV body, or a tall wagon with tons of interior space and manageable exterior proportions placed on a car platform with all-wheel drive and a slightly elevated ride height. 

Inside the new Forester, vast improvement over the previous model is obvious. While the previous Forester seemed to be adorned with lots of cost saving plastic bits, the new Forester has a decidedly upscale look. Rich colors and quality materials seem, at first glance, to put the Forester in the �luxury SUV� category � it kind of looks European. Upon closer inspection however, the Forester�s interior bits are not as high-quality as they look. This is not meant as a criticism of the quality inside the Forester, but rather a testament to how much improvement there is visually inside this car, it is a very pleasant place to spend time. 

While the metallic looking center console looks lavish and upscale, it is little more than silver plastic. Again, it not a complaint so much as an observation � besides, Subaru could use aluminum and chrome throughout the interior the way Audi does, but then it would not longer be a $22,000 car (in fairness, they do have chrome door handles). Leather in the Forester is high quality and gives the front and rear seats an extra measure of comfort. 
 
While much has changed inside the Forester, much has remained the same. The 2003 Forester still offers cavernous cargo and people space just like it always has. Head room is plentiful as is rear seat leg room. Rear seats fold down in a 60/40 split fashion, and when they�re both folded down the Forester�s cargo capacity is rivaled only by  monstrous full size SUVs and assorted minivans. The rear cargo cover is very easy to remove and install. The rear cargo area also boasts many easy to use storage areas, some are incorporated in the sides, while others have panels that open into the floor. The only thing more impressive than the Forester�s cargo carrying ability is the size of its enormous sunroof. When fully open, the sunroof gives the Forester a convertible quality.
 
Two complaints about the interior: 1) The top-of-the-line XS with Premium Package lacks power seat controls and at just over $25,000 it should at least offer the option. 2) The center storage bin/armrest is virtually useless as an armrest. Too many times I found myself entering the car clumsily with the expectation of an armrest to put my elbow on � it�s just too low.

The Forester is improved on the outside as well, in fact that is where the most noticeable changes have occurred. A revised front end treatment and more stylish rear help the Forester shake it�s rather generic look of the past. Taillights have a bit of Mercedes-Benz look, while the front headlight and grille treatment look more aggressive than before.
 
On the road the new Forester feels much more refined than Subarus past. This is due partly to the four-wheel independent suspension and the new hydro-formed front sub-frame. The hydro-formed sub-frame is largely a safety feature designed to absorb impact, but the underlying result seems to be more rigidity. Hydro-forming is simply a process by which high pressure liquid is used to shape steel tubing. A similar process is used on the new GM trio of SUVs, TrailBlazer/Envoy/Bravada, but to a larger degree. 

Around town the Forester feels small enough to navigate the urban jungle without worry. This is in stark contrast to even somewhat mid-sized SUVs such as the Mitsubishi Montero or GMC Envoy which can feel a little large in a crowded urban area. Rough roads do cause a bit of bumping in the Forester, but it�s not unbearable. The open highway is where the Forester does it�s best work, this is one of the better �family summer trip� cars. Despite the tall roof, wind noise is not intrusive, and despite the slightly challenged flat-4 engine, there little noise from under the hood as well. This is surprising given the lack of sound deadening on the under side of the lightweight hood. Noticeable engine noise is present under hard acceleration, but even when the revs go up as the result of mild passing, the noise level still remains acceptable.

Acceleration is more than adequate. The new Forester feels slightly peppier than the previous Forester S, but once you fill up all that cargo area with junk, the Forester can tend to feel a bit challenged in the horsepower department. Compared to another car-based SUV such as the Toyota RAV4, the Forester�s power is impressive; 165 hp to be exact. Compare this to the little Toyota�s 148 hp. Even the much larger Toyota Highlander (in 4-cylinder form) makes 10 fewer ponies (155 hp) and less torque. 

In normal everyday driving there is always plenty of power for expressway merging or passing at low or moderate speeds, and yet I can�t help but think it could use a little more power � I know I�m greedy. One of the pluses of the 2.5L flat 4 engine is torque, while it does pack a fairly impressive 165 hp, that same engine is good for 166 ft. lbs. of torque. Compare this to the 142 ft lbs of the RAV4�s 2.0L engine and 163 for the Highlander�s 2.4L motor.

Subaru is a race-proven and rally winning company, so they really know how to make cars go fast. While driving the 2003 Forester, I couldn�t help but wonder what the Flat-6 engine from the Outback VDC, or the 227 hp WRX engine would do if installed in the Forester. 

Order the 5-speed manual transmission and you�ll get Subaru�s Hill Holder. A device that helps keep the car stopped when the clutch in fully depressed, but the car is on a slight incline. Didn�t Studebaker come up with that? I had a 1959 Studebaker Lark that used the same type of technology and boy did I love that�. I digress. Either way, it�s a really great idea and sort of points to Subaru�s innovativeness and where they�re headed as a company.

The Forester offers just what it promises; car-like ride and handling with SUV versatility. In fact, much of the Subaru literature is nothing more than the usual sales and marketing copy touting this feature or that � the difference is, in many cases the PR copy that accompanies the Subaru press kits and brochures rings quite true in practical everyday driving situations. 

Subaru claims a �just right� vehicle proportion which allows maximum interior space with an easy to judge exterior � and that seems to be true in the real world. Another Subaru quote; �The Forester blends positive SUV attributes such as high seating point and interior versatility with passenger car comfort, handling and fuel efficiency.� Again, they�re not lying, the Forester does offer some of the qualities that have made SUVs popular without sacrificing fuel economy or ease of parking. 

While the Forester does offer a car-like ride, handling is certainly not sporty. Does it drive and feel like a car? Yes. But, expect body roll and lean to fall somewhere between Chevy Tahoe and Toyota Camry. This is no WRX in terms of handling, but calling it car-like is certainly not wrong � it is a car after all. 

Overall, the new 2003 Forester is a huge improvement over the 2002 model. It is better looking inside and out, offers more features for a similar price and squarely beats other, more traditional SUVs at their own game, all the while not breaking the bank. 

If you need to traverse some serious off-road trails or tow a cabin cruiser or need third-row seating, the Forester is not for you. But, if you need a car-like SUV with a versatile interior, rugged looks and all-wheel drive, add the �03 Forester to your shopping list. Better yet, if you�ve already decided on a Forester as your next family hauler, do yourself a favor and wait for the 2003 version � the improvements will be worth it.
