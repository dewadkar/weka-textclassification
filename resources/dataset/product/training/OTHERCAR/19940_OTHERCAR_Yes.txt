            When I was 18, I bought a '93 GT-S with 82K on it for 6500 bucks. My friends (big GM lovers) thought I was crazy for buying something with "so many miles on it and so old." Come to find out, they were just used to their American cars "with American horsepower" blowing up after 130,000 miles. I have to admit that I was worried, too, but I remember my mother's Camry running like a top with 115,000 miles on it before she traded it in on a new one...I knew Toyotas ran for a long time. 

Well, I am more than surprised. See, with the Camry, it would be taken in right on schedule for maintenance. But me with the Celica is a different story- I just don't have the money to do that. Still, the thing runs like a top with 130,000 miles on it.  I took it down to South Carolina (from NY) a couple months after I bought it and then to Florida and back (from NY) this past April with 115,000 miles on it. All through those extreme temperature situations, like sitting in construction in Jacksonville with the A/C on, the engine temperature guage never so much as moved a bit higher than it normally is. To this day, the oil never looks broken down when I change it and she still turns heads on a summer night- and the car is 10 years old.

Now, let's talk about the performance of this car. I realize the model I have is a GT-S, which in '93 was turbo-charged and therefore puts out roughly 70 more horsepower than a GT and like 80 more than an SE, so I'll just mention the handling. Well, first of all, I'll just say this - the GT-S in a '93 Celica is A LOT faster than a GT-S of 2000-03. I can CRUSH a lot of v-8 sportscars...Mustangs, Camaros...it doesn't matter. She's fast. The handling seems to be pretty underrated by you guys. My car has the same suspension as a GT and the same handling...I have the same size tires as stock - everything on the car is base and it handles like a champ. You ever gone 130 mph in your Celicas? The car handles great, even around corners - the tires don't even squeal. And to have a car spin rubber in first and second gears and chirp into third, well, that's saying something.
