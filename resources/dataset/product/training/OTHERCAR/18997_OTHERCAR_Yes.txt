            The 2003 Hyundai Tiburon is the first car to truly challenge the current Toyota Celica for an affordable exotic-look sports GT.  While Acura and Mitsu etc. may have engine packages that make their rigs fun to drive, the droll boring body style in the RSX case, and the extremely embarrassing boy racer indentations on the Mitsubishi pretty much cancel out the positive attributes leading to the same old compramised packages available from most builders.  The Tiburon GT has blended a powerful V6, which by the way, only requires 87 octane fuel, with a body style that is well balanced.  An excellent suspension package, intergrated fog lamps, a leather interior, 360 watt factory Infinity stereo with small subwoofer, a power sunroof and built in alarm/security system along with the incredible warranty makes this car a can't miss. We sat 4 hours straight each way in one day with no backside burn.  The Recaro designed sport buckets are all they have been claimed to be.  All for under $19,000 out the door.
   The ride is quiet, the craftsmanship in our Carbon Blue GT-V6 is comparable to the other models we tested and drove, including the RSX ($26,000) The Celica GTS Action Pkg.($27,100) and the Mitsu Eclipse V6 (23,800).  The V6 midrange power is impressive. It has a modest amount of G-Force.  Off the line is very acceptable and the car absolutely flattens and hugs the road on long freeway entrance and back road sweeps. You can easily double the recommended yellow sign speed postings 35 mph and above with no protestation or wallow from the car. We have been averaging 23 mpg in a combo of city and plus 80 mph freeway jaunts.  The mileage should improve after break in.
   Hyundai reminds me of the progressive era of Honda in the early to late 80's.  Pushing the envelope of what the buyer can purchase for less, and reinvesting in their product line.  From the Excel to the 2003 Tiburon in 15 years in an incredible jump.  Our family has always had Celica's around and lately a ZX2 as well.  Neither current model stands up to our new Tiburon for value and brute power.  The GTS Celica is quick and fast but only at high RPM.  It is a dog around town.  If you are looking for a good amount of bang for the buck, you will be cheating yourself if you do not test drive the V6 Tiburon.
