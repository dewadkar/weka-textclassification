            there's every reason in the world why you would want to go digital.  Not only do you get to look at the pictures right after you take them, you save all that time of going to the film place a paying extra for the one hour prints that you have to have. Going digital avoids that problem and lets you see the result on the spot. No more wories about film or anything else. You can save time and avoid waisting your rolls of film in order to get the whole thing developed. One of the neatest qualities is the ability to change the picture on the computer. If you want an affect that is unusual or you want to alter the background, it's a click away.
Defenitely a fun hobby<br><br>
