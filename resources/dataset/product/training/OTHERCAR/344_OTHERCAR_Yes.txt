                When I first began shopping for an SUV I realized that the majority of SUV's were designed strictly for the family concept.  After test driving the XTERRA I realized that I did not have to give up my youth to own an SUV.  The XTERRA is fits the role of a traditional SUV, while still appearing sporty and &quot;hip&quot;.  It is by far the most unique SUV I drove,which explains why I purchased one.
    The XTERRA is very affordable and is loaded with safety features such as anti-lock breaks, interior side door beams, dual air bags and a first aid kit built into the vehicle.  This was an important factor as I have children.  I love the unique body style, the raised roof line which allows rear-seat passengers to see over the driver.  It is best described as &quot;theater seating&quot;.  The cargo room in the XTERRA is amazing compared to that of similar sized SUV's, with ample room for storage.  The one area for improvement is the limited leg room for rear seated passengers.  The XTERRA handles very well, and provides a stable ride on rough terrain.  The cornering is exceptional.  This is a great vehicle for a single person who enjoys adventure, or for a family with no more than two children.  The versatility is unbelievable!!
