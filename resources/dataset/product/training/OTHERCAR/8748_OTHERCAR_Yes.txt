            Overall, I'm very pleased with this camera. It was more than I expected. Right out of the box I began playing with it, and found that the battery was already about 75% charged for me so I could begin shooting right away. I plugged it in to complete the charge anyway while I read the manual and played with it. I'm impressed with quite a few things about this camera: it has a nice, vivid LCD screen in the back, aluminum casing, easy controls and set-up, easy upgrading (firmware upgrade takes less than 5 minutes), and ease of transferring the images to the computer. To hook the camera up, I basically plugged the USB connector into the USB port on the computer (Win2000) and was able to look at the pictures through a totally new removable drive in Windows Explorer. I did this without installing ANY of the software yet. Now THAT is connectivity! I'm very pleased with the image quality and options for pictures. Anyone who likes the manual aspect of setting shutter speed, aperture, and f-stops with enjoy the features of this camera since you can set them all custom. It even has histogram graphs for pictures. It also allows the changing of white balance, black & white, vivid, and sepia color configurations in all modes. I'm VERY surprised with the SmartMedia. The camera comes with a 16MB card, and on the lowest quality (half resolution) it can hold about 182 pictures. Now low quality half resolution sounds pretty bad, but they are impressive still. Granted, you would NOT use that resolution if you were planning on printing images, but for simply capturing huge amounts of pictures with a 16MB card, it works great. The camera also includes a video cable that allows you to actually run a slide show on your computer or TV (or VCR, or DVD-RAM, or anything with RCA inputs.)I also liked the fact that you can compress and alter image quality on the fly through one of the camera's many menus. It allows you to gain extra space in case you run low on SmartMedia space. Speaking of that, the new firmware I installed today increases the autofocus performance and bumps the SmartMedia compatibility up to 123MB. 
Probably the most impressive feature of this camera is the ability to take movies WITH SOUND! I'm not talking long movies, but simple movies for those occasions where a single shot without sound won't do (which when you have this feature, you'll find will occur frequently). It also will record about 74 minutes of just audio. As far as drawbacks go, the lens cap doesn't connect to anything. Boo hoo. You know, if that's what stops you from buying this, you're too picky. No camera will be perfect, and that's why you have a pocket. Second, the battery time could be improved, and is proprietary. Rechargeable AAs would have been a better solution, I think. Other than those two minor things, the only other problem I've had is focusing in odd lighting conditions (darker is tougher to focus), but many of those problems seemed to be helped with the firmware update. 

Overall, I recommend this camera very much. For the price it's at now, you can't beat it. It competes with Nikon's Coolpix and Sony and Olympus.
