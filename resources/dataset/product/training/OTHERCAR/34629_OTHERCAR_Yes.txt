            I've never understood the appeal of minivans, they have always seemed to me to be the WORST of all possible car worlds - a car that looks and handles like a truck, yet without the toughness of a real truck.  While the Montana is not the perfect car, it did surprise me.  First  and foremost is the sheer utility offered in the Montana.  Certainly no one would call the interior luxurious, however it is quite functional.  Seats that fold this way and that way, remove two, leave one, and on and on it goes.  

Up front, the captain of this family wagon has control of virtually everything. Steering wheel mounted audio controls, and motorized, pop-out side rear windows are an excellent idea, as is the interior light kill switch.  With so many lights inside it would be almost impossible to tell if junior left one of the rear reading lights on.  Oh sure you'd find out eventually - like maybe the next morning when you're calling AAA for a jump start.  As great as some of the features are, the controls for these ingenious inventions are often placed in odd locations.   Many switches require a bit of a reach to operate. Overhead buttons look cool but are all the same size and shape and require a glance away from the road to figure out. Seats are comfortable, 5 hours and not one kink or cramp.  Rear seats fold down to double as a table top with built in cup holders.  Come to think of it, the Montana has more cup holders than any one family could possibly use.  The rear seats come out fairly easily, though not as easily as in the Chevrolet Tahoe.

GM's 3400 V-6 is as smooth as ever, rivaled only by Honda or Toyota.  The Montana gives you 185 hp, it's not a lot, especially considering 3.4 liters. Acceleration is  adequate around town.  Transmission shifts smoothly, although seems to kick-down a little too soon (needs more power???) under moderate highway passing.

What's not to like about the Montana?  Only a couple things.  First, the ride is much too soft.  The larger Chevy Tahoe handles better, and feels more predictable in evasive maneuvers.  On the open highway the Montana has, at times, an almost bouncy feel.  Second, given that many Montana drivers will be mom's with their hands full, the rear door should be easier to open and close.  One should be able to open and close the rear door with one hand.  As a consolation, the remote controlled power sliding side door is a dream come true when hands are full.

As an added bonus, the entertainment package allows rear passengers to listen to different music than the front passengers.  The TV/VCR is also nice option, especially useful for road trips.  It even has it's own remote so you won't have to lean forward or bother the driver to watch your favorite tape. 

The built in air compressor is another brilliant idea. Good for filling up rafts at the beach, balls at the park or tires in an emergency

The Pontiac Montana is the same car as the Chevrolet Venture and the Oldsmobile Silhouette.  Montana is the best of the bunch, styling may be a little on the sporty side for some, but it looks good and performs equally well. If you are considering a Dodge Caravan, look at a Montana - you'll be surprised.<br><br>
