            I have been visiting the BMW shop quite often since I ordered my 2000 328Ci.  30K miles and many problems, the latest one topped it all off. Water leaks! That's right...my floor panel on the driver's side was soaked when it rained.  Other problems are as follows:

1. Upon delivery of new car the side molding was damaged
   and the plastic seat rail cover was broken.
   Status: Fixed
2. Rear light bulb kept going out.
   Status: Fixed
3. Interior sliding sunroof cover guiding pins broke.
   Status: Fixed
4. Thermostat replaced due to car not heating properly.
   Status: Fixed 
5. Rear window defroster not working properly.
   Status: Fixed
6. Rattling noise at certain speeds.
   Status: Fixed somewhat. They found some debris inside 
           the tire. Interesting?
7. Center console wood trim not installed properly.
   Status: Replaced and Fixed.
8. Jack hold down screw broken.
   Status:Replaced.
9. Water leaks on driver and passenger side doors. Seems 
   to be a rubber seal problem. Interior carpet was 
   soaked after hard rain.
   Status: Just noticed...apt. made to repair.

If this is what German engineering is all about then they can keep it in Europe. The Ultimate Driving Machine isn't so. The quality is not there.
